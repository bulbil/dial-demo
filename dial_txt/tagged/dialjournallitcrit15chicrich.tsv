		Among subscription books , that is , books necessarily issued in parts , at greater or less intervals , it is surpassed by none in intrinsic - worth or in the ease with which the infrequent payments can be borne .

		Unlike cyclopaedias , it can never become completely antiquated , and time will affect it mainly in the particular of neologisms ; for , as its illustrations of usage are marshalled in chronological order , the history of each word or meaning may be added to but can not be detracted from and we can not foresee the day when a sup - plement will be undertaken .

		22 THE LITERATURE CONGRESSES .

		THE DIAL has given , from time to time , accounts of the remarkable series of gather - ings planned for the Exposition season by the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	.

		These Con - gresses , which have been uninterruptedly in progress since the middle of
May	DATE	, are designed to cover all the important fields of intellectual activity , and each of them has been placed in charge of a competent local committee of ar - rangements , with full power to plan the ses - sions and extend invitations to those whom it is desirable should participate .

		Up to the present time , the Congresses have dealt with the work of representative women , with the public press , medicine , temperance , social re - form , and with the problems of commerce and finance .

		The Congresses of the present month will include the three subjects of music , litera - ture , and education , subjects relating to the higher aspects of culture , and thus making a particular appeal to the constituency addressed by THE DIAL .

		We propose , in the present article , to outline the more important features of the Literature Congresses planned for the week beginning with the tenth of
July	DATE	.

		Literature , as used in connection with these gatherings , is a term to be taken in a broad sense , as appears from the primary classifica - tion of the work to be done .

		Five sections have been established , dealing respectively with libraries , history , philology , folk-lore , and lit - erature proper .

		The work of the five sections will be carried on at the same time , and through - out the greater part of the week ; but the pro- grammes have been arranged , as far as it has been found possible to do so , with the view of bringing into session , at a given time , the in - terests least likely to conflict with one another , so that those in attendance upon the respective sections may not be unduly disturbed by the promptings of a divided duty .

		Thus the mem - bers of any one section will be free to at - tend those meetings of the others most likely to be attractive to them .

		The real work of the
Congresses	ORGANIZATION	will begin on
Tuesday	DATE	, the evening of the preceding
Monday	DATE	being given up to an informal reception to the visiting members and the interested resident public .

		The
Congress of Librarians	ORGANIZATION	, in charge of a committee having Mr.
F. H. Hild	PERSON	, of the Chi - cago
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as chairman , will be su - perimposed upon the regular annual confer - ence of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	proper will probably occupy four sessions , and for these sessions more than a score of papers have been secured .

		The con - ference of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	is planned to occupy three further sessions , for which the programmes have been arranged by the officers of that body .

		The public has always taken much interest in the meetings of the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, and the meeting of this
summer	DATE	, with its unusual features , will probably be the most important ever held , as well as the most fruitful in prac - tical outcome .

		The profession of the librarian 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, is growing in importance every year , and the public is coming more and more fully to recog - nize that librarians are not merely collectors and custodians of books , that the function of facilitating to the public use the libraries under their charge is at least as important as any other that they are called upon to exercise .

		The work of the section devoted to histor - ical literature has been undertaken with the cooperation of the American Historical Asso - ciation , by a committee having as chairman Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Six sessions are planned , and for them have been collected upwards of thirty papers , mostly by American writers and upon American sub - jects .

		The healthful activity of local historical studies has been one of the most promising in - tellectual signs of recent years , and our coun - try has developed a school of historical inves - tigators hardly second to that of any other in industry , in scientific method , or in philosoph - ical outlook .

		A few of the more important papers to be read at this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are the fol - lowing : '' The Inadequate Recognition of Di - plomatists by Historians , '' by President
James B. Angell	PERSON	; '' Personal Explorations at Wat - ling
Island	LOCATION	, '' by
Herr Rudolph Cronau	PERSON	, of
Leipzig	LOCATION	; '' Condition of
Spain	LOCATION	in the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, `` by Professor
Bernard Moses	PERSON	; `` Early Slavery in
Illinois	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
William Henry Smith	PERSON	; and '' The Time-Element in American History , '' by Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	.

		The work of the
Congress of Philologists	ORGANIZATION	has been planned by a committee having as chairman Mr.
W. M. Payne	PERSON	, with the coop - eration of the
American Philological Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	, and the
American Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		These three societies will hold formal meet - ings , and their work will be supplemented by a number of papers obtained from outside sources , many of these relating to Oriental philology and archeology .

		About sixty papers will be included in the work of the philolog - ical section , and it will be necessary , during the greater part of the week , to hold two ses - sions at the same time .

		Among the features of these sessions may be mentioned the annual address of the President of the
American Phi	ORGANIZATION	- lological Association , Professor
W. G. Hale	PERSON	, upon the subject of '' Democracy and
Educa	PERSON	- tion , '' discussed in the last number of THE DIAL ; a paper by Mr.
T. G. Pinches	PERSON	, of the British Museum , upon '' Unpublished Manu - script Treasures '' ; a paper by Professor
Rich	PERSON	- ard
Garbe	PERSON	, of the
University of Kbnigsberg	ORGANIZATION	, upon '' The Connection between Indian and Greek Philosophy '' ; a paper by Dr.
Richter	PERSON	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, upon '' The Archaeology of
Cyprus	LOCATION	'' ; a paper by Professor
Emil Hausknecht	PERSON	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, upon '' Pedagogical Questions in Ger - many '' ; a paper by Dr.
William C. Wins	PERSON	- low , Vice-President of the
Egypt	LOCATION	Exploration Fund , upon '' Old Testament History in the Light of Recent Discoveries '' ; and a paper by Professor
F. A. March	PERSON	, upon '' The Language of the Sciences and a
Universal Language	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The papers above named will be read by their authors .

		Other European philologists coming to
America	LOCATION	for the express purpose of attend - ing this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are Professor
Wilhelm Streit	PERSON	- berg , of Freiburg -LRB-
Switzerland	LOCATION	-RRB- , Professor
E. A. Sonnenschein	PERSON	, of
Birmingham	LOCATION	, and Profes - sor
Hermann Osthoff	PERSON	, of
Heidelberg	LOCATION	.

		Among the important papers sent from
Europe	LOCATION	to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are the following : '' Assyrian Tablet Libraries , '' by Professor
A. H. Sayce	PERSON	, of Ox - ford ; '' Canons of Etymological Investigation , '' by Professor
Michel Breal	PERSON	, of the College de
France	LOCATION	; '' Koptic Art and Its Relation to Early Christian Ornament , '' by Dr.
Georg Ebers	PERSON	; and `` The Great Altar at
Dagr el Baharee	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Thebes	LOCATION	-RRB- , '' by Dr.
Edouard Naville	PERSON	, a paper presenting the results of the author 's latest ex - cavations .

		Extensive as is the programme of the Phi - lological
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that of the Folk-Lore sec - tion is still more extensive .

		Mr.
Fletcher S. Bassett	PERSON	, the enthusiastic chairman of the com - mittee upon this subject , has obtained upward of seventy papers from specialists in all parts of the world , and has secured the attendance of some of the most distinguished among
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean folk-lorists , including
M. Charles Ploix	PERSON	, President of the French Society ; Mr.
J. Aber	PERSON	- crombie , Vice-President of the English So - ciety ;
Herr Ulrich Jahn	PERSON	, of the
Berlin	LOCATION	Society ; and Mr.
Smigrodski	PERSON	, of
Warsaw	LOCATION	, who comes as the representative of several
Continental	ORGANIZATION	societies .

		One feature of the Folk-Lore Con - gress will be of extraordinary interest .

		On
Friday	DATE
evening	TIME	a concert will be given for the purpose of illustrating the popular songs of the various races of mankind .

		This concert is made possible by the presence at the
Exposi	PERSON	- tion of many types of humanity , and a score or more of nationalities will be represented in the programme .

		No single event of the week is likely to attract wider attention or excite more general interest .

		The
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, in which our read - ers probably take a more general interest than
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL in any other , promises to be remarkably suc - cessful .

		The local committee of arrangements , having Mr.
F. F. Browne	PERSON	as chairman , some time ago enlisted the services of an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	committee of the best-known American writers , with Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	as honorary chairman , and Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	as secretary .

		Largely owing to the efforts of this
Committee of Cooperation	ORGANIZATION	, a very import - ant programme has been drawn up , dealing with the commercial as well as the artistic aspects of authorship .

		The former of these aspects will be presented very forcibly by Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, who comes as the representative of the
English Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, and who has awak - ened in his fellow-countrymen much interest in the
Chicago Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	comes not only to speak in his own person , but also as the bearer of many important papers by En - glish writers , among which may be mentioned '' Some Considerations on Publishing , '' by Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	; '' The
Berne Conference	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Sir
Henry Bergne	PERSON	; '' Literature and the Press , '' by Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	; and The Future of the Drama , '' by Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	.

		A fact of extraordinary interest in connection with this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is the expected presence of the greatest poet of modern
Italy	LOCATION	,
Signor	PERSON	Car - ducci , although it is not yet known what part he will take in the proceedings .

		The subject of Copyright will have an important place in the work of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, being discussed not only in the papers sent by English contribu - tors , but also by Mr.
A. L. Spofford	PERSON	,
Libra	PERSON	- rian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who will preside -RRB- , by Mr.
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, and Mr.
George E. Adams	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		On the subject of
Criti	ORGANIZATION	- cism , papers will be read by Messrs.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	-LRB- who will preside -RRB- ,
John Bur	PERSON	- roughs ,
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	,
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	, and others .

		On the subject of
Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, there will be papers presented by Messrs.
G. W. Cable	PERSON	-LRB- who will preside -RRB- ,
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	,
Joseph Kirkland	PERSON	, Mrs.
Mary H. Catherwood	PERSON	, and Miss Alice French .

		Mr.
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	, and many other American writ - ers of distinction are also expected to be pres - ent at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and take part in the work ; but it is impossible at this date to give a more detailed account of the programme .

		Enough has been said , however , to make it clear that the gathering will be of great interest to all literary workers , and that important practical results may very probably remain as its out - come .

		The week of the Literature Congresses , taken as a whole , may be seen , even from the outline of facts presented in this article , to - promise a degree of attractiveness to all sorts of intellectual interests that is rarely offered the public at any one time and place .

		After the Congresses are over , THE DIAL will again take occasion to summarize their features , and to point out what shall appear to have been significant in the results achieved by them .

		CHRONICLE AND COMMENT .

		The Come ` die Francaise could not come to
Chi	LOCATION	- cago this
summer	DATE	, for reasons playfully set forth in a recent article by
M. Sarcey	PERSON	, and it has , instead , gone to
London	LOCATION	, where it is to remain a month , and produce no less than forty-seven pieces of its reper - tory .

		The programme includes classical and mod - ern plays in great variety , among which '' Hamlet '' is noteworthy , although we hardly recognize the tragedy in the description u drame en vers en cinq actes par MM .

		Dumas et
Paul Meurice	PERSON	. ''

		But we have no doubt that it is our own Hamlet that
M. Mounet-Sully	PERSON	will present to his audience .

		We must remember that it was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Cleopatra that was , after all , given us by Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	, although disguised in lines that made no pretence of being Shakespearian .

		The opening performance of the French Play in
London	LOCATION	was signalized by a '' Salut a Londres , '' written by
M. Claretie	PERSON	, and re - cited by Mile .

		Reichemberg , from which we extract a few verses : `` Salut , pays du grand Shakespeare , Au nom de Corneille le Grand ; Aux souverains d'un double empire Ou le g & iie accepte et rend ; '' Ou , loin de la dent des couleuvres , II proclarae invincible et fier Le libre e ` change des chefs-d'oeuvre A travers les vents et la mer ! ''

		Mr.
Edgar Prestage	PERSON	writes to the
London	LOCATION	'' Acad - emy '' to complain of the neglect of Portugese lit - erature by English students .

		To say that
Portugal	LOCATION	has produced but one author of the first rank Camoens is a statement as absurd , in his opinion , as '' that
England	LOCATION	has produced no great poet with the exception of Shakespeare . ''

		He calls particu - lar attention to three great writers of the present century
Almeida Garrett	PERSON	,
Anthero de Quental	PERSON	, and
Joao de Deus	ORGANIZATION	saying of the latter that he is '' without doubt , the greatest lyric poet now living . ''

		Curiosity should certainly be stimulated by so en - thusiastic a description of a poet whose name means nothing at all to most English readers , but we fear that the case is a hopeless one .

		If the poet in question were a novelist , or even a dramatist , he might come into general recognition ; but no lyric poet is ever appreciated outside the circle of those whose language he sings .

		Heine has come nearer than any other lyrist of the century to such general favor , but even
Heine	PERSON	is known to most non-Ger - mans chiefly for his humorous and ironical prose 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, or for his pathetic life-story .

		It was not
Byron	PERSON	's slender lyrical gift that made him a
Continental	ORGANIZATION	favorite , but the fact that he stood as an energetic and picturesque spokesman of the revolutionary spirit .

		Even
Shelley	PERSON	is practically unknown out - side of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The greatest of living lyrists pace Mr.
Prestage	PERSON	is probably Sig - nor
Carducci	PERSON	; but to how many who are not Ital - ians is he more than a name ?

		Hugo 's highest achievement was in the lyric , but to the English - speaking world he was the novelist and hardly more .

		These statements apply with almost equal force to
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	; but who , unfamiliar with Norwegian , thinks of
Bjornson	PERSON	as a lyric poet ?

		There is no help for it .

		We can translate novels , and plays , and epics ; we can not translate songs .

		A nation must be content with its own lyrists ; the genius of the singer proper is , by no process known to the alchemy of the translator , reproducible in another form of speech than that in which it finds native expression .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Literary World '' recounts an al - leged recent '' experience '' of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, telling us that the philosopher has '' received a let - ter from a Wild West American publisher , asking how much he would take for the exclusive right to publish his poem , ' The Faerie Queen , ' in the States . ''

		The story is not even ben trovato , but it shows well enough how we are libelled at times by the arro - gant foreigner .

		In this case , revenge follows promptly , for the same issue of the paper , a few pages further on , informs its readers that Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	is a daughter of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	; and , still later , inserts an anxious query as to the authorship of the line , '' From perilous seas in faery lands forlorn . ''

		People who live in glass houses should not pretend that the brown-stone fronts of their neighbors are constructed of the same brittle material .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		PERHAPS AN ERROR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The frequent letters of '' F. H. '' to '' The Nation '' are read with great interest and valued very highly , I am sure , by all American students of modern English .

		Nevertheless , there is something in these letters -LRB- if it may be said -RRB- that would be pleasanter if it were dif - ferent .

		A reader of a half-dozen of them can not help wondering whether F. H. '' has ever made a mistake , the master is so masterful , his censure is so pungent .

		The grammatical question examined below is trivial , perhaps , but the examination itself becomes important if it be regarded as helping somewhat towards answer - ing the more serious inquiry , Has '' F. H. '' ever erred ?

		It should be premised that '' F. H. '' has identified himself in '' The Nation '' -LRB- more than once , I think -RRB- as the author of Modern English , '' and that there can not be any impropriety , therefore , in referring to him here as the author of that well-knowu and very valuable work .

		The present case is this : At page 85 of his '' Modern English '' Dr.
Hall	PERSON	quotes from
Marsh	PERSON	's '' Lectures on the English Language , '' and in one of the sentences quoted inserts sic in brackets after known to .

		This is the sentence quoted from
Marsh	PERSON	's Lectures : '' The word respect , in this combination , has none of the meanings known to -LSB- sic -RSB- it , as an independent noun , in the English vocabulary . ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	says of this sic in a foot-note : `` A
Lord Grenville	PERSON	of former days wrote of ' a long and destructive warfare , of a nature long since unknown to the practice of civilized nations . '

		Here , remarks
Coleridge	PERSON	, ' the word to is absurdly used for the word in . '

		-LRB- ' Essays on His own Times , ' p. 262 . -RRB-

		Not unlike the nobleman 's ' unknown Jo , ' the context considered , is Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	's ' known to . ''

		1 '' -LRB- `` Modern English , '' p. 85 . -RRB-

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's sic and foot-note seem to show that he re - gards such uses of known to and unknown to as lacking authority and censurable .

		It may be assumed here that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	does not find anything objectionable in a use of known to that occurs often in his own writings , as in the following instance : '' ... the historical fact , known to everybody '' -LRB- `` Mod - ern English , '' p. 192 , foot-note -RRB- .

		Such use has been very common for a long time .

		But the same construction is common when the word with which known to or un - known to is connected has been substituted by me - tonymy for something else , as camp for people in the camp . ''

		THE DIAL IN
KASHMIR	LOCATION	AND WESTERN
TIBET	LOCATION	.

		* The handsome volume entitled '' Where Three Empires Meet '' contains the interesting account of Mr.
E. F. Knight	PERSON	's recent trav - els in
Kashmir	LOCATION	, Western Tibit ,
Gilgit	LOCATION	, and ad - joining countries ; the book taking its title from the fact that it is hard by
Gilgit	LOCATION	, on the high roof of the world , as it were , that the three greatest empires ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	, converge .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	is a very agreeable writer , with a keen eye for out-of - the-way traits and humors ; and his book , be - sides being rich in the solider sort of facts , is pleasantly anecdotal , and , on occasion , drily humorous .

		Kashmir has been called the north - ern bastion of
India	LOCATION	, and
Gilgit	LOCATION	may be de - scribed as her farther outpost .

		Of the
Happy Valley	ORGANIZATION	itself , the author did not , as he tells us , see much , the greater part of the year -LRB- 1891 -RRB- being spent by him among the desolate moun - tain-tracts to the north of it , where the ranges of the
Hindoo Koosh	PERSON	and Karakoram form the boundary between the dominions of the Ma - haraja and that rather vaguely defined region called
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		In the course of the journey he visited the mystic land of Ladak , and he reached
Gilgit	LOCATION	in time to take part in
Colonel Durand	LOCATION	's expedition against the raiding Hunza-Nagars , thus falling in with ex - ceptional opportunities for observing how things are ordered on the Indian frontier , both in peace and war .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	prudently con - fines himself , so far as possible , to the narra - tive of his own sufficiently varied experiences , without attempting to theorize as to what ought to be done or left undone on the frontier .

		He remarks : '' The Indian government can be trusted to do every - thing for the best , as heretofore ; and while it is foolish for people at home to airily criticise the policy of those highly-trained Anglo-Indian experts who have made the complicated problems of our Asiatic rule the study of a lifetime , it is still more foolish for one to do so who has spent but a year in the
East	LOCATION	, and who , there - fore , has just had time to realize what a vast amount he has yet to learn . ''

		Especially interesting and opportune is the account of
Kashmir	LOCATION	a sort of debatable land , at present , the affairs of which are likely soon to attract a good deal of attention .

		In order to understand the ground , at least the ostensi - * WHERE THREE EMPIRES MEET .

		A
Narrative of Recent Travel	ORGANIZATION	in
Kashmir	LOCATION	,
Western Tibet	LOCATION	,
Gilgit	LOCATION	, and the
Adjoin	LOCATION	- ing Countries .

		By
E. F. Knight	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ble ground , of late British interference in that country , a few general facts touching its more recent history must be borne in mind .

		Kash - mir , having been wrested from the Pathans by the Sikhs in
1819	DATE	, was attached to the Pun - jab until the termination of the Sutlej cam - paign , when it fell into the hands of the Brit - ish who did not , as the author significantly observes , at that time realize its immense value .

		It was at once assigned by treaty , dated
March 16 , 1846	DATE	, to the Maharaja of Jummoo , partly in consideration of certain services rendered .

		In exchange for the cession the Maharaja was to pay over the very inadequate sum of seventy - five lacs of rupees , besides engaging to come to the assistance of
England	LOCATION	with the whole of his army whenever she was at war with any of the people near his frontier .

		He also ac - knowledged
England	LOCATION	's supremacy , and agreed to pay an annual tribute consisting mainly of
Kashmir	LOCATION	shawls to the government .

		By this treaty , not only the Vale of
Kashmir	LOCATION	, but
Ladak	LOCATION	,
Baltistan	LOCATION	, and the
Astor	PERSON	and
Gilgit	LOCATION	districts , became the appanage of the
Mahara	PERSON	- jas of Jummoo .

		During the reign of the present ruler ,
Pertab Singh	PERSON	, the Indian Gov - ernment has '' lent '' to the
Kashmir State	ORGANIZATION	mil - itary and civil officers `` to superintend the much-needed reforms in the administration of the country . ''

		The author describes what he saw of the work of these officials in a rather non-committal way , and he reaches the conclu - sion that the present active policy of Great
Bri	PERSON	- tain in
Kashmir	LOCATION	, '' while having for its object the safeguarding of our Imperial interests , will bring about a great amelioration in the condi - tion of the population . ''

		Despite this need of foreign interference in its internal affairs , Mr.
Knight	PERSON	found Kashmir the '' safest land he had ever seen or heard of '' one of the few coun - tries , indeed , in which it is possible for a lady to travel without escort in a perfectly uncon - ventional way . ''

		Every
summer	DATE	English ladies wander about Kash - mir alone , taking their caravans of native servants , bag - gage animals , and coolies , pitching their tents at night , and riding the stages in the same independent fashion as their brothers and husbands would . ''

		This immunity of travellers from offences against person or property seems to be due partly to the native dread of the dominant British race , partly to the drastic Oriental cus - tom by which a whole district is made amen - able for crimes committed within its boun - daries .

		The account of
Kashmir	LOCATION	itself , its climate , 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, natural resources , etc. , is highly favorable .

		The whole of the state is practically independ - ent of rain , a fairly hard winter storing a suffi - ciency of snow on the mountain-tops , so that the gradual thaw of the
summer	DATE	, which keeps the irrigating canals constantly brimming , is all that is needed to insure a harvest .

		The famines in
Kashmir	LOCATION	have been caused , not by
summer	DATE	drought , but by a too mild winter , or by heavy rains in the hot season which have flooded the plains and drowned out the crops .

		The climate of this Asiatic paradise seems to be well adapted to Europeans , the few English children who have been born and brought up there being as strong and rosy-cheeked as if they had been bred at home .

		The great draw - back to an Indian career , the necessary sepa - ration between parents and children , is thus quite avoidable in
Kashmir	LOCATION	; and Mr.
Knight	PERSON	regretfully observes , '' Had we not sold this magnificent country , a great military canton - ment would no doubt have been long since es - tablished here . ''

		The resources of
Kashmir	LOCATION	have never been exploited , though Mr.
Knight	PERSON	makes it evident that should British capital ever be admitted into the country there will be ample scope for it .

		According to some authorities , only one - third of the available land is under cultivation , and even that does not produce nearly what it might .

		Valuable minerals undoubtedly exist , and it is probable that should the long-pro - jected more-than-once-surveyed railway be made ,
Kashmir	ORGANIZATION	will become a large exporter of agricultural produce and of the delicious fruits for which it is famed .

		At present the industrial enterprise of the country is centred , that is to say is strangled , in the hands of the
Maharaja	LOCATION	.

		His , for instance , are the saw - mills , his the wine and brandy monopoly .

		French experts conduct the latter branch for him , producing wine , both red and white , of excellent quality ; and our author thinks it is not too much to say that the vineyards of
Kashmir	LOCATION	should some day make
India	LOCATION	inde - pendent of
France	LOCATION	, at least for claret of the ordinary description .

		In point of scenery and natural charm Kash - mir seems to be all that the author of '' Lalla Rookh '' -LRB- which poem our author makes it a point of honor not to quote -RRB- has taught the northern fancy to paint her .

		It is a land of running water , of fruits and flowers and birds -LRB- not omitting , one hopes , the bulbul , though Mr.
Knight	PERSON	does not mention it -RRB- , and sweet odors and sparkling cascades , a land , in short , that assures the traveller that the beau - ties of far-famed
Kashmir	LOCATION	have not been exag - gerated by Oriental poets .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	who is a capital hand at description , terse , vigor - ous , and sparing of the finical details of the '' word-painter '' writes as follows of the scen - ery along the road to Baramoula : '' We drove through pleasant groves of chestnuts , walnuts , peaches , pears , cherries , mulberries , and ap - ples , all of which are indigenous to this favored land , while the wild vines hung in festoons from the branches .

		The fresh grass beneath the trees was spangled with various flowers great terra-cotta colored lilies , iris of several shades , and others while hawthorn bushes in full blossom 'em ulated the whiteness of the snows above .

		The mountains , too , were craggy and grander in out - line than any we had yet seen .

		Highest of all were the dreary , snow-streaked wastes , lower down forests of deodar crowned the cliffs , which in their turn often fell sheer a thousand feet to the green , lawn-like ex - pauses below . ''

		The nominal masters of this favored land seem to be utterly unworthy of their good for - tune , as a rule , says our author .

		An English - man coming to the country for the first time takes a great fancy to the handsome , cheery , outwardly civil and obliging Kashmiris , and it is not until he has been some time in the coun - try that he discovers them to be among the most despicable of creatures , incorrigible cheats and liars , and cowardly to an inconceivable de - gree .

		Tartars , Tibetans , Moguls , Afghans , Sikhs , have in turn overrun the Happy Val - ley , whose inhabitants have always meekly sub - mitted to each new tyranny , their very abject - ness proving their salvation .

		Says Mr.
Knight	PERSON	: '' I had been a good deal among Mohammedans in other countries , and had always associated dignity and courage with the profession of that creed , so was dis - agreeably surprised to discover this cowardly , cringing , cackling race among the followers of the prophet . ''

		A
Kashmiri	ORGANIZATION	will unresistingly take a blow from anyone , even from a Kashmiri ; the people who , however , wrangle among themselves like the proverbial washerwomen having achieved such a depth of cowardice that they actually fear one another .

		To understand the Kash - miri thoroughly , which is to dislike him , one must have seen , for instance , a great bearded man meekly submitting to having his ears boxed by a Punjabi half his size , whom he could crush with one hand , weeping and shriek - ing like a naughty child under the maternal slipper , '' and finally rolling on the ground and howling at the feet of this lad of a more plucky race . ''

		On the other hand , `` one must have observed his covert insolence to some griffin globe-trotter , who does not understand the ras -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ll cal yet , and treats him too leniently .

		He will presume on any kindness that is shown him , until , at last , going too far , he is brought to reason by the thrashing he has long been ask - ing for . ''

		In short , the inhabitant of the
Happy Valley	ORGANIZATION	is a paradoxical creature , for he has , withal , certain rather feebly revealed good qualities , difficult to describe , and certainly not admirable , save , perhaps , to that school which affects to despise physical courage as a relic of savagery .

		The qualities of the serpent are often cou - pled with those of the dove ; and the Kash - miris , meekest of men , are uncommonly sly at a bargain , and are gifted , moreover , with a mercantile pertinacity not unworthy of the '' book-agent '' of less favored climes .

		Some of these
Kashmir	LOCATION	merchants will go to great lengths , stepping unbidden from the shore to the prow of the tourist 's '' doongah , '' crowd - ing into his cabin , pressing their wares upon him , and declining to move until forcibly ejected .

		To enjoy even a modicum of peace , the sahib must be brutal , and actual privacy is only to be gained with a stick .

		Any hint short of this is lost upon hawkers of the lower sort .

		A beating he understands as a hint that he must take himself off .

		Then he departs , smil - ing ; it is all in his day 's work ; and to cheat the sahib out of one anna will recompense him for many blows .

		Our author says of the mer - chants of Srinagur an especially pestilent class : '' They were all adepts at blarney , and with a jovial persuasive volubility extolled their own wares and cried down those of their neighbors in more or less broken English .

		Their pertinacity was extraordinary .

		The sweetly-smiling , long-robed ruffians would not take no for an answer .

		< I do not want you to buy , sir , ' one would say in a gentle , deprecating way , after some em - phatic refusal on my part to have any dealings with him . '

		Please to understand , sir , that I do not wish to sell .

		I only ask you to do me the honor of looking at some of this excellent workmanship .

		It will not fail to interest you . '

		Then , if I should order him to be gone , and explain that I was busy , ' In that case I would not on any account interrupt you , ' he would urge , < but I have nothing myself to do , sir , so I will sit down here and wait until you are quite unoccupied ; then I will show you some beautiful things . '

		And thereupon he would squat down on the grass in front of the boat , surrounded by his merchandise , to remain there silent and motionless , contemplating me with a smile of pa - tient amiability . ''

		These people employ all sorts of curious de - vices to attract the attention of the rich or powerful sahib a habit , however , by no means confined to the merchant class .

		Even learn - ing forgets , on occasion , its dignity .

		Once , for instance , in
Srinagur	LOCATION	, Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	, the Settlement Officer for
the State	ORGANIZATION	, on coming out of his bungalow , found a strange object in front of his door , surrounded by a deferential crowd .

		On walking up to it he discovered that it was nothing less than an ancient pun - dit , stark naked , standing on his head .

		The acrobatic sage was thus patiently balancing him - self , meditating , doubtless , the while on
Nir	PERSON	- vana , while he awaited the coming out of the sahib .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	ordered the learned man to be turned right side up , and the case was dealt with forthwith .

		The following incident , of which Mr.
Knight	PERSON	was an eye-witness , illustrates this curiously puerile side of the Kashmiri character .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	was then holding court just outside
Islamabad	LOCATION	: '' Two suppliants came up , who , after the manner of Kashmiris , had carefully got themselves up in pitiable plight with a view of attracting sympathy for their cause .

		These two big men had stripped themselves naked , and had smeared their bodies all over with foul , wet , blue mud from the river bed .

		Even their hair and faces were thickly covered with the filth , through which their eyes glittered comically ... They came up and stood before the Settlement Officer , quietly sa - laamed , and then suddenly and of one accord com - menced to weep , groan , and shriek most dismally , while they wrung their hands or clasped them imploringly , writhing their bodies as in agony , etc. ... Their story was , that while they were working in their fields an official had taken from them by force some grass straw of the value of twopence .

		The said official had moreover plucked their beards ; in evidence of which they produced two or three hairs , which they affirmed had been pulled out . ''

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	refused to listen to men in so filthy a condition , and the court accordingly adjourned itself and went to breakfast while the plaintiffs washed themselves .

		The Kashmiri , with all his rascality , always demands , on leaving his employer , a chit , or written testimonial .

		If convicted of theft or other offence he will endure without a murmur the mulcting of his pay ; but a chit , good , bad , or indifferent , he must have .

		So insensible is he as to the purport of these talismans that he does not take the trouble to get them translated , but presents them all , good and bad , for your consideration .

		One official , encountered by Mr.
Knight	PERSON	, was the proud possessor of many chits : '' He handed one to me , and gazed at me with a sol - emn expression of conscious merit as I read it .

		This chit was from a captain sahib , and ran thus : ` This man is the greatest thief and scoundrel generally I have ever come across . ' ''

		On reaching Ladak , really a part of
Tibet	LOCATION	, Mr.
Knight	PERSON	found himself in a strange country , 12 -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, a land , as he says , of topsy-turveydom , where polyandry prevails instead of polygamy , where praying is carried on by machinery , where the traveller from beyond the mountains is every day bewildered by quaint sights , strange beliefs , customs , and superstitions .

		Ladak is still almost as theocratic a country as Chinese Tibet , and no less than one-sixth of the population are in the church .

		The Church is well endowed , and the lamaseries , several of which were visited , seem to be organized in a very business-like way .

		There are two classes of monks in each : the working monks , who attend to temporal inter - ests , and the spiritual monks , who devote their time to dreaming and religious exercises , and to whom , our author thinks , `` to judge from their abstracted expression and general ap - pearance , the bladder-flappers of the Laputan sages would be useful attendants , to wake them up when it was time to wash . ''

		From the latter class the abbot is chosen , and in a few cases a lamasery has as its spiritual head no less holy a personage than a skooshok , or incarnation .

		It seems that after a man has attained a high pitch of virtue , and has thus escaped liability to re-birth in any of the six ordinary spheres , he can when he dies either enter the Nirvana , or .

		* return to earth as a skooshok .

		The Skooshok of
Spitak Gompa	LOCATION	, for instance , a very exemplary personage in - deed , is believed to have been re-incarnated seventeen times , and to have been , in his first stage , a contemorary of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of these holy men , the
Skooshok of Tikzay	ORGANIZATION	, was visited by Mr.
Knight	PERSON	: '' He appeared to be a man of middle age , and had a gentle , intelligent face .

		He spoke but little , and had a dreamy , far-off look in his eyes .

		For most of the time that we sat with him he was abstractedly gazing at the immense landscape that was extended before him deserts , oases , the far-stretching
Indus Valley	LOCATION	, and the snowy mountain-ranges ... His incarna - tions have been many .

		He thoroughly believes that he was Skooshok of Tikzay at a date when we British were naked , painted savages , and has been gazing cen - tury after century over the same glaring wilderness from this high monastery top .

		At times he muttered prayers almost inaudibly as he sat by us , contemplating the scene with mild , sad eyes .

		He ordered a gift of sugar and dried apricots to be brought to us , and then we bade farewell to the incarnation , whom we left still praying and dreamily considering the world below . ''

		Oddly enough , one never hears of Mahatmas in Ladak or in
Tibet	LOCATION	proper .

		The lamas know nothing of them , and the nearest approach to the mysterious beings seems to be the skoo - shok though the author doubts whether a European esoteric Buddhist would accept one of these incarnations as his spiritual master .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	, like other travellers , notes the striking resemblance between the ritual of Ti - betan Buddhism and that of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	: '' The lamas , who represented the saints in this mum - mery , had the appearance of early-Christian bishops : they wore mitres and copes , and carried pastoral crooks ; they swung censers of incense as they walked in pro- cession , slowly chanting .

		Little bells were rung at in - tervals during the ceremony ; some of the chanting was quite
Gregorian	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was the partaking of a sort of sacrament ; there was a dipping of fingers in bowls of holy water ; the shaven monks , who were looking on , clad almost exactly like some of the friars in
Italy	LOCATION	, told their beads on their rosaries , '' etc. .

		Several of the best chapters are devoted to a description of the Hunza-Nagar expedition of winter before last one of those innumera - ble little broils which
England	LOCATION	has had on her hands of late .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	volunteered as an officer , thus securing excellent opportuni - ties of observation .

		The book is , on the whole , one of the most graphic and entertaining of its class , delightfully written , and full of informa - tion regarding a region well out of the orbit of the ordinary globe-trotter .

		There are a number of capital illustrations from photographs by the author .

		THE WORKS AND WORK OF
FRANCIS GALTON	PERSON	.

		* Two remarkable books have just appeared by Mr.
Galton	PERSON	. ''

		Hereditary Genius '' was published in
1869	DATE	, but has for years been out of print .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	has written a new pref - ace for it , and reprinted it otherwise as it first appeared . ''

		Finger-Prints '' is entirely new , and embodies the author 's latest study along a novel line .

		Between
1869	DATE	and
1892	DATE	, between the publication of '' Hereditary Genius '' and `` Finger-Prints , '' three other notable works by the same author were published : '' English Men of Science , '' '' Inquiries into Human Fac - ulty , '' and '' Natural Inheritance . ''

		There are perhaps not five such original books in the lan - guage ; certainly there are few scientific works in any language that are dictated by so honest a purpose .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	is now a man of sev - enty , and it may not be uninteresting to review here his scientific work .

		Two subjects perhaps have attracted his par - ticular attention , Heredity and Identification .

		The former is dealt with in all his books , the latter in `` Finger-Prints . ''

		Everywhere Mr. * HEREDITARY GENIUS ; NATURAL INHERITANCE ; FINGER - PRINTS .

Francis Galton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13
Galton	PERSON	is an anthropologist and a statistician .

		He reduces his results , wherever practicable , to mathematical form and statement .

		In '' He - reditary Genius '' he assumes that high repu - tation is a fairly accurate test of high ability -LRB- = genius -RRB- .

		From this assumption he proceeds to study certain groups of eminent men .

		He considers first the judges of
England	LOCATION	from
1660	DATE	to
1868	DATE	, and carefully examines into the family histories to ascertain how many and what eminent relatives they had .

		Similar studies are made of the statesmen of the time of George the Third , of the Premiers of the last hundred years , of men of literature , scien - tists , painters , musicians , divines , and scholars .

		Lastly , some data from oarsmen and wrestlers are presented .

		In each series it is shown that there are more eminent relatives in the families of given men of talent than mathematical prob - abilities require .

		Some few quotations or con - clusions may be interesting some of them im - portant in the discussion , some merely inci - dental .

		Talent , it seems , is dreadfully rare ; medi - ocrity is painfully common .

		Out of any mil - lion of Englishmen over fifty years old only about two hundred and fifty are really eminent . ''

		Ability , in the long run , does not start suddenly into existence and disappear with equal abruptness , but rather it rises in a gradual and regular curve out of the ordinary level of family life .

		The statistics show that there is a regular average increase of ability in the generations that precede its culmination and as reg - ular a decrease in those which succeed it .

		In the first case the marriages have been consentient to its produc - tion ; in the latter they have been incapable of preserv - ing it . ''

		One of the best tables in the work is the one giving the facts regarding statesmen .

		These are generally eminently gifted , and their rela - tionships are rich in ability .

		Nor is the abil - ity distributed at haphazard : it clearly affects certain families .

		Moreover , the peculiar com - bination of gifts that make up a good states - man high intellectual power , tact in deal - ing with men , power of expression in debate , ability to endure exceedingly hard work is hereditary .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	makes some sug - gestive statements regarding the cause of peer - ages dying out , why very pious parents may have wicked children , and how the church has hin - dered man 's progress .

		Men of ability who are raised to peerages are prone to marry heiresses ; or , if they do not do so themselves , their sous do .

		But the heiress only child in a family comes from an infertile stock , and is little likely to be herself the mother of a vigorous family .

		Pious persons , according to Mr.
Gal	PERSON	- ton , are naturally endowed with high moral characters combined with instability of disposi - tion , peculiarities in no way connected .

		The child may inherit both , or he may inherit one without the other ; in neither of the latter cases will he be markedly pious , in one he may be truly bad .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	claims that the policy of the church during the middle ages , in enforcing or encouraging celibacy in the best men and women of the time , placed a premium upon mediocrity .

		Our author believes that the chance for emi - nence in the relationship of an eminent man varies with the degree of kin .

		He says : '' I reckon the chances of kinsmen of illustrious men rising or having risen to eminence to be fifteen and one - half to one hundred in case of fathers , thirteen and one - half to one hundred in the case of brothers , twenty-four to one hundred in the case of sons .

		Or , putting these and the remaining proportions in a more convenient way , we obtain the following results : In the first grade , the chance of the father is one to six ; of each brother , one to seven ; of each son , one to four .

		In the second grade , of each grandfather , one to twenty-five ; of each uncle , one to forty ; of each nephew , one to forty ; of each grandson , one to twenty-nine .

		In the third grade the chance of each brother is about one to two hundred , except in case of first cousins , where it is one to one hundred . ''

		Nor are different races equally gifted with ability .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	considers the Negro race two grades in his scale of ability below the En - glish .

		But he believes that we are surpassed by the Athenians at their prime by at least an equal amount .

		This claim may be true , but it is not palatable .

		In this discussion the author strikes the key-note of his work , the underly - ing idea of all his study .

		He believes that we ought to raise the grade of ability of our race , that we should breed a nobler posterity .

		Ear - lier marriage of the capable is the only way for the intellectually and morally fit to survive .

		This practical application of the results of his apparently non-utilitarian and theoretical stud - ies is ever the most striking feature in Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's writings .

		Passing by his '' English Men of Science '' and '' Investigations into Human Faculty , '' al - though both are interesting and characteristic , we will consider '' Natural Inheritance '' the most mathematical of the series .

		To discover the parental influence upon the offspring , he finds it necessary to get rid of sex , and trans - forms the female character of the mother into male equivalents ; he then combines the pa - rental influences , and , by averaging , secures an 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ideal mid-parent whose qualities are what are really inherited .

		He finds a constantly oper - ative law of regression toward mediocrity , and shows that gifts of high order are little likely to be transmitted fully . ''

		The more bounti - fully a parent is gifted by nature , the more rare will be his good fortune if he begets a son who is as richly endowed as himself , and still more so if he has a son endowed still more largely . ''

		But the law is even-handed , and the son no more inherits all his father 's wickedness and disease than he does his good points .

		In this study , the heredity of stature , eye , color , artistic taste , disease , and the matter of latent characters , are discussed .

		The material used is interesting .

		What was needed was the facts regarding several succeeding generations , each containing a considerable number of individ - uals equally related to each other -LRB- fraternities , etc. -RRB- ; groups , not individuals .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	offered a considerable sum in prizes for family records , which were used as the basis of these studies .

		Some material was also secured at his
Anthropometric Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	.

		But human material , sufficient in quantity and precise in character , is very difficult to obtain ; and to secure fraternities of the desired size and rep - resentative of several generations , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	directed careful cultures of sweet peas and '' pedigree moths . ''

		He concludes that every individual receives from each parent one-fourth of his endowment and from each grandparent one-sixteenth .

		As a final conclusion , he says : '' Suppose two couples , one consisting of two gifted members of a poor stock and the other of two ordinary members of a gifted stock .

		The difference between them will display itself in their offspring .

		The children of the former will tend to regress ; those of the latter will not . ''

		Here again we see his plan for amelio - ration .

		We have referred above to Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's
Anthropometric Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is known to most visitors to the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	.

		In it anyone may be thoroughly examined and measured free of charge ; a permanent record is made of his measurements and faculties , and a copy is given to him for his own use .

		For use in this
Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Galton	PERSON	has devised some most ingenious pieces of apparatus for the study of delicacy in hearing , quickness of blow , keen - ness of eyesight , etc. .

		In devising such instru - ments and pieces of apparatus for clearly illus - trating points of considerable mathematical complexity , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	is a veritable genius .

		He is also the inventor of composite photog - raphy , which has been used in so many ways in science .

		For some years past those who were measured in the Laboratory have left the impression of their finger-tips behind them , and a study of this material has led to his last book , '' Finger-Prints . ''

		As in all his writing , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	presents first a summary of the treatment to be pur - sued in the book .

		Finger-prints have been used among various peoples in signing legal papers , but have seldom been used for purposes of identification .

		Sir
William Herschel	PERSON	made such use of them in
India	LOCATION	.

		A full statement of the methods of taking finger-prints , of en - larging them , and of study , are then given .

		Anyone who will look at his own finger-tips will see that they are covered with curved ridges surrounding a central core ; this core may be either an arch , a loop , or a whorl .

		Taking into consideration the ridges above and below these cores , and the cores themselves , some nine fundamental patterns may be made out .

		These may serve as a basis for classifica - tion .

		In any given pattern there are also minor details which characterize it .

		But confining attention to only the more important points , one may easily and exactly describe any given combination .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	thinks that he finds , from careful study of a considerable number of cases , that the patterns are persistent from birth to death .

		If this is so , and it is likely that finger-prints of two persons are never identical , we have here , of course , an import - ant means for identification .

		After finding how many points of comparison are presented in a single finger-print , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	calculates the mathematical probability of any two per - sons having the print made by any single fin - ger identical , at 1 : 2
s6	ORGANIZATION	, or 1 to 6400 millions . ''

		It is a smaller chance than 1 to 4 that the print of any single finger of any given person would be exactly like that of the same finger of any other member of the human race . ''

		What would the probability of identity be if all ten finger-prints of one man were compared with all ten of those of another ?

		Everyone knows how important a rapid , simple , and certain means of identification is to-day .


Bertillon	PERSON	's method of measurement met the demand so well that it has rapidly been adopted in re - formatories arid prisons , but it is by no means certain .

		It is true that a man who can make
Bertillon	PERSON	's measurements is more readily found than one who can compare finger-prints ; but two minutes ' time would add a card of finger - prints to the anthropometric data secured in
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 Bertillonage , and the combined data would make identification absolutely sure .

		Mr.
Gal	PERSON	- ton , after considering the identification value of finger-prints , makes some study of the he - redity of patterns , which he believes to exist ; he finds considerable resemblances also be - tween twins .

		His study of finger-prints of dif - ferent races is not very extensive ; but he has studied some material from
Welsh	LOCATION	,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	,
Negro	LOCATION	, and Basque sources .

		From this he con - cludes that there are no ethnic peculiarities .

		It seems to us , however , that such a conclusion is premature .

		Such , in brief , is Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's work , remark - able alike for its originality , its practical im - portance , and its scientific value .

		THE HOMERIC QUESTION ONCE MOKE .

		* Did Homer write the '' Iliad , '' or was it an - other man of the same name ?

		This question , as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	tells us , with his character - istic impatience of laborious futility , has been discussed with learning , with ingenuity , with genius even ; but it has the inconvenience that there really exist no data for determining it .

		And yet .

		unmindful of
Seneca	LOCATION	's warning that life is too short to debate the authorship of the '' Iliad '' and '' Odyssey , '' Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, master in the art of evading vain logo - machy with an epigram , now inflicts upon a book-ridden world four hundred pages of su - pererogatory demonstration that the German higher criticism of Homer is naught .

		Is he preparing a volume to disprove the Baconian authorship of the plays of Shakespeare ?

		As a student , I perused two or three thou - sand pages of erudite German and Latin treat - ises in order to earn the right to enjoy my Homer in peace .

		But I date from two mem - orable conversations the final illuminating and restful conviction that the Homeric ques - tion should be relegated to the large leisure of
Milton	LOCATION	's fallen angels , along with the free-will controversy , the problem of the nature and ori - gin of the Roman gens , and the determination of the dates of the Platonic dialogues .

		I was once talking with a well-known German Ho - merid about certain favorite passages in the closing books of the '' Iliad , '' the lament of Briseis over the body of Patroclus , and the threnodies of Andromache and
Helen	PERSON	for Hec - * HOMER AND THE EPIC .

		By
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,

Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		tor .

		These passages my interlocutor had pro- nounced late interpolations ; and , half in jest , I expressed my regret at the sacrifice of this exquisite poetry on the altar of science . ''

		Yes , '' he gravely replied , '' they are not by Homer , but were all composed by one interpolator who had a special talent for dirges . ''

		The other conversation was an argument with an
Ameri	PERSON	- can colleague , a distinguished professor of com - parative philology .

		Our debate terminated in the '' mere oppugnancy '' of assertion and coun - ter-assertion .

		It was to him axiomatic that no early Greek poet could have employed for va - riety or metri causa any dialectic form not familiar to his infancy in his native isle or can - ton .

		And he also stoutly maintained that there was an irreconcilable contradiction be - tween the last line of the first Iliad , in which Zeus and all the Gods go to bed -LRB- or to sleep -RRB- , and the first lines of the second book , in which '' the other gods slumbered all night , but sweet sleep did not hold Zeus . ''

		Neither of these affirmations would '' shine in on me , '' as the Germans say , and the debate ceased from want of common standing-ground of principles .

		Now Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book is a prolonged printed conversation of this type with the German Homerids , and with his friend Mr.
Walter Leaf	PERSON	, who has wasted much good paper on these themes in his otherwise excellent edition of the '' Iliad , '' and in his recently-published '' Companion to the Iliad , '' which would be much more companionable if it were not stuffed with this unsatisfying sawdust .

		In his intro - ductory chapters , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	retells the thrice - told tale of the Homeric controversy from the days of
Wolf	LOCATION	, summarizing and refuting point by point
Wolf	PERSON	's famous but much overrated '' Prolegomena . ''

		He then analyzes in detail the story of the '' Iliad '' and the '' Odyssey , '' smoothing over the hitches in the plot detected by exigent German exegesis , and defending the more important of the passages that have been stigmatized as interpolations .

		It is a wearisome business , as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	says , to undo the '' knots in the bulrush '' which this petti - fogging criticism is perpetually discovering .

		A few specimens must suffice .


Herr Fick	PERSON	, for ex - ample , rejects the fight over the body of
Pa	ORGANIZATION	- troclus because the prologue explicitly declares that the wrath of Achilles gave the bodies of heroes to the dogs and the birds .

		As if there were nothing in '' Paradise Lost '' that the heavenly muse is not bidden to sing in the prologue !

		Diomede , when confronted with the unknown Glaucus in the sixth book of the 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, '' Iliad , '' declines the combat until he can be assured that his opponent is not a god in dis - guise . ''

		Flat burglary as ever was committed , '' cry our learned Dogberrys .

		For has not Dio - mede just wounded Aphrodite and struck down Ares in the fifth book ?

		But
Diomede	PERSON	had been expressly warned by
Athena	ORGANIZATION	to confine his attacks to Ares and Aphrodite , and the power of '' discerning god from man '' was of course not a permanent endowment , but was bestowed upon him for that occasion .

		Again , the petitionary embassy of the Greeks to Achilles in the ninth book is thought to be irreconcilable with Achilles ' scornful or doubt - ful references in later books to the possibility or probability of such an appeal to his pity .

		But in repeated readings of these books in the class-room , I have never known a student to stumble at this supposed stone of offense .

		And , indeed , it does not require much insight into the logic of passion to see that an angry man may well spurn profferred atonement to-day , and yet cry out exultingly when he sees his enemy reduced to still more grievous straits on the morrow . ''

		Now methinks that the sons of the Achaeans will stand in prayer about my knees , for intolerable need is come upon them . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	makes much use of Matthew Ar - nold 's argument of the improbability of the ex - istence of four or five nearly contemporaneous great poets , all working in the '' grand style . ''

		One is pleased to note that he repudiates Pro- fessor
Jebb	PERSON	's suggestion that what the great critic took for the grand style was merely the traditional epic diction , an assumption suffi - ciently refuted by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's discriminating re - marks on
Quintus	ORGANIZATION	of
Smyrna	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	also points out that
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	, in the days of proof-readers , could not attain to any - thing approaching the unfailing accuracy de - manded by Homeric critics ; he affirms that the lapses and nods of Homer are not dis - cernible to the unmicroscopic eye , and that they never disturb any readers except `` spectacled young Germans on their promotion '' ; he shows that philosophic consistency is not to be looked for in scenes where the gods play a part , '' mythology being consistent only in inconsis - tency '' ; and then , growing weary of the con - troversy , petulantly protests that it is idle to argue with men who , to prove that a certain idea is unhomeric , expunge all passages in which it occurs .

		And yet he still persists in arguing , and grows too angry to be always amusing : '' A critic who can seriously advance such a theory simply proves that he is incapa - ble of understanding what poetry is . '' ''

		It is possible to give people poetry , but impossible to give them the brains to understand and the hearts to feel it . ''

		Is there not a slight failure here in the urbanity that we look for in the writer of '' Letters to Dead Authors '' ?

		We should bear in mind the provocation , however .

		For it appears from the chapters on the '' Odys - sey '' that he has actually read
Kirchhoff	LOCATION	and
Niese	PERSON	through , pen in hand .

		The nervous strain of such a task palliates , if it does not justify , the vivacity of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's irreverent treatment of an argument contributed to the discussion by an estimable scholar who is thought in
Germany	LOCATION	to combine literary grace with scientific thoroughness , Wilamowitz-Moel - lendorf : ''
Telemachus	PERSON	-LRB- Ody .

		1 , ^ 7 - ? -RRB-

		sits down in his bed and takes off his chiton .

		But the chiton reached to his feet .

		How then could he take it off when sitting down ?

		The critic can try the experiment with his night-shirt : he will be far from ingenious if he does not solve the problem . ''

		More attractive than these polemics are the archaeological and literary chapters at the end of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's volume .

		What is the relation of the
Mycenae	LOCATION	finds to the art described in Homer ?

		Closer study reveals that the two arts are not identical , as was incautiously as - sumed at first .

		How shall we date the art of
Mycenae	LOCATION	by Egyptian or by Assyrian analo - gies ?

		Examples of Mycenaen art have been found in Egyptian tombs of the sixteenth cen - tury B. C. , a date which startles the most res - olute pre-Dorian .

		On the other hand , if we make the treasures of
Mycenae	LOCATION	rich in gold contemporaneous with the Assyrian art of the period from 800 to 600 B. C. , we must assume that the later Greeks , while preserving the earlier Homeric tradition , had completely for - gotten the mighty chiefs who so recently had reared the Lion 's gate of
Mycenae	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	evidently doubts the possibility of attaining certainty with our present knowledge .

		Can we argue that Homer is later than carved gems because he never mentions them ?

		We could in the same way infer that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is later than tobacco .

		Can we date pottery by the tomb in which it is found ?

		But ancient heir - looms may have been buried with the dead , or modern articles dropped or deposited by a des - ecrating or pious hand .

		Then , too , there is the malicious fact that '' old Mexican pottery is often , in shape , color , and decoration , hardly to be distinguished from that of
Mycenae	LOCATION	or lalysus . ''

		It would be unbecoming for a
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 layman to dispute the dicta of professional archaeologists , but when these doctors disagree he may divert himself with the '' rival plausi - bilities of archaeological argument . ''

		Finally , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's account of the ''
Nibel	PERSON	- ungen Lied , '' of the '' Chanson de Roland , '' and of the '' Kalevala , '' conveys much useful information in compact convenient form .

		He explodes the false analogies that have been al - leged between the composition of these poems and the supposed redaction of the '' Iliad '' by the commission of Pisistratus .

		And while he does full justice to the grandeur and pathos of certain episodes of the story of
Brunhild	LOCATION	, he never allows the reader to forget that '' ' tis a pretty poem , but you must not call it Homer . ''

		THE SOCIAL , SPIRIT ix
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The growing interest in social problems throughout our country , both among scholars and the masses , is a hopeful and wholesome tendency to be welcomed and , fostered .

		There is here something more than a passing fashion or a mere literary pastime .

		Every intelligent and earnest mind recognizes that serious tasks of industrial reorganization are upon us .

		And this widespread consciousness of their existence , and the fertility in the invention of schemes for the bringing in of the millennium , are signs of promise that give us hope .

		Pauperism and crime are not new diseases , but the systematic effort to prevent and extir - pate these evils is a modern enterprise .

		The unjust distribution of wordly goods and the great miseries of the toiling masses , these have existed since the beginning of history ; but the encouraging fact is that they are now felt and fought as never before .

		The maga - zines overflow with discussions of the innumer - able phases of the social problem ; special or - gans
spring	DATE	into existence to lead attacks upon specific strongholds of the common enemy ; the daily press sends reports of new theories and philanthropic efforts abroad on the wings of the morning ; special organizations spread as by magic to relieve some peculiar distress or re - press some particular wrong ; these questions have come to the front in our Universities , and the pulpit begins to occupy itself with the topics and phases of social science .

		this is well .

		It will make religion more hu - mane , more practical , and more catholic ; it will give us a literature of ethical power as well as of attractive beauty .

		Above all , it will regenerate human society by the intelligent ap - plication of remedial and educative agencies for the purification and enrichment of its cor - porate life .

		Two notable contributions to the discussion of these problems have recently been made by Mr.
N. P. Oilman	PERSON	and the Rev.
Washing	PERSON	- ton
Gladden	PERSON	, the former in '' Socialism and the
American Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, '' and the latter in '' Tools and the Man . ''

		The two books , though differ - ent in scope and method , have this much in common : they are both earnest in spirit , tem - perate in the discussion of the problems treated , and preeminently wholesome in their general teachings .

		Neither Mr. Oilman nor Mr.
Olad	PERSON	- den is doctrinaire or fanatic , but both men are practical Americans , anxious to learn from the teachings of all experience , and yet deeply con - scious -LRB- Mr. Oilman more especially -RRB- that our social problems must be wrought out by inde - pendent thought working through methods de - signed to fit our peculiar conditions .

		Both men feel the tremendous sweep of the socialis - tic sentiment , and yet neither has parted com - pany with that common-sense which keeps close to reality and brings all theoretical schemes to the test of experience .

		These pages reveal a deep sympathy for the larger aims of social - ism , but neither author commits himself to any special socialistic programme , both being evolu - tionists rather than revolutionists .

		And here we have ample recognition of the moral aspects of industrial problems , with a clear realization that spiritual forces have a part to play in the ongoing and upbuilding of human society .

		Both these books seem to me to be preemi - nently sane and opportune , spurs to the apa - thetic and indifferent , and needed correctives of that merely sentimental treatment of social problems which has been so much in vogue re - cently in and about
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	's is by far the more scientific , original , and import - ant treatise , with a stronger grip on the prob - lem of socialism and a clearer vision of what is possible and expedient .

		Scholars will find in it a positive contribution to the topics dis - cussed , and its words will do much to win men from flying socialistic kites to the slow but sure tasks of social amelioration .

		Mr.
Gladden	PERSON	has made a little book that will stir many a com - placent business man to new thoughts respect - ing the rights of laborers and the proper uses 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, of his gains ; and it will do immense good by making thousands realize that Christianity , to be worth having , must be penetrated with the ethical passion and devoted to practical minis - tries of love .

		The purpose of Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	is not to give a history of socialism , though he weaves the es - sential facts of its various movements into the texture of his discussion .

		He does not attempt to expound or refute its principles so much as to bring them into comparison with the Amer - can spirit , and in this indirect way he shows how far the spirit of socialism may be wel - comed and also how far the socialistic pro- gramme conflicts with what is most precious and fundamental in our institutions .

		The ear - lier chapters of his book contain a very clear and admirable discussion of the factors at work in American society , the part played by in - dividualism and the part played by corporate and governmental methods .

		These chapters may well be commended in the strongest terms as a most valuable statement of what consti - tutes our manifest destiny as a nation , as well as a summary of what is highest in American citizenship .

		The author shows how incompatible Ameri - can institutions are with the socialistic pro- gramme , and yet he constantly takes issue with Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, whom he criticises in a very forcible manner .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	, in his discussion of the functions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, fol - lows , it seems to me , the path of the golden mean : the government must be an opportunist , doing whatever is needed by the individual that the individual can not well do for himself ; and yet the individual must be a living cell in a fluent organism rather than a cog in a mere machine .

		The two chapters on '' The Indus - trial Future '' and '' The Way to Utopia '' con - tain a large amount of clear thought and sober judgment which will do much to extend right views in these directions .

		From the author of '' Profit Sharing '' we naturally expect some - thing more than an allusion to this subject ; and we are not disappointed .

		This work will probably displease many per - sons , especially the disciples of Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	holds `` Looking Backward '' up to the light , and shows without much trouble , but better than is done anywhere else , what a frail and gauzy fabric it really is .

		The severe critic could easily find some fault , here and there , with Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	's pages , but I shall not attempt to criticise in detail or describe his work at greater length .

		I wish rather to com - mend it heartily as a very able discussion of the American spirit and the relation of social - ism to our institutions .

		Almost every page has words of wisdom which make the path of the American citizen a little plainer .

		Mr.
Gladden	PERSON	has produced a very helpful book for the people who will constitute the ma - jority of his readers .

		He has not written for scholars or specialists ; but as in his former book , '' Applied Christianity , '' he here tries to carry the authority of Christianity over into social affairs , while he also tries to interest Christians more fully in social problems .

		He endeavors to point out what changes the appli - cation of the Christian Law ought to make in the use of property , the holding of land ; upon industrial organizations , and upon competition in general .

		His pages stir us to enthusiasm for nobler policies in business , where his arguments seem inconclusive ; his earnestness imparts a moral fervor , where his theories sometimes fail to win the assent of reason .

		Everyone must join with him in the desire that love and jus - tice gain new power in the shop and on the market .

		But some of his statements , in their lack of scientific precision and in their inten - sity of expression , remind us that we are lis - tening to an oration from the pulpit rather than the calm deliverance of a specialist and a philosopher .

		Especially to be deplored is the loose and expansive way in which the term Christian is used .

		Mr.
Gladden	PERSON	is constantly asking : What does Christian Ethics demand here ?

		and what does Christian Law make nec - essary here ?

		And yet these terms are nowhere defined ; they are used with little reference to their primitive meaning ; and even the right of Christianity to this supremacy is nowhere established .

		It seems to me that he construes the Christian Law very much to suit himself -LRB- always , however , for noble things -RRB- , putting into it a great deal that did not belong to orig - inal Christianity , a great deal that is grandly human rather than specifically Christian .

		In this way the content of Christianity is en - larged and enriched , and people are thus led to accept many new things as Christian and au - thoritative , upon the supposition that they were a part of original Christianity .

		But it may well be doubted whether this course is justified by history , or is calculated to give social sci - ence the firmest basis , or motives of helpfulness the very greatest and most enduring power .

		However , the book is the word of an earnest man , and it will do good wherever read .

		THE DIAL 19 An excellent American Guide-book .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		By the publication of the long-prom - ised
Baedeker	PERSON	's '' United States '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , American makers of guide-books are afforded a much needed object-lesson in compactness , in arrangement of ma - terial , and in beauty of cartography .

		In none of these respects has the Baedeker standard of excel - lence ever been approached by a guide-book of American production .

		Mr.
J. F. Muirhead	PERSON	is the author of the book , and his work has been done with great care and thoroughness .

		We have no - ticed no considerable inaccuracies , and but few mis - prints , in spite of the
Leipzig	LOCATION	typography of the work .

		The special introductory features are an ac - count of our political history , by Professor Mc - Master ; a study of our political institutions , by Professor
Bryce	PERSON	; North American physiography , by Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	; chapters on the fine arts in
America	LOCATION	, by Messrs.
W. A. Coffin	PERSON	and Mont - gomery
Schuyler	PERSON	; and essays upon our climate , our aborigines , our sports , and our social institutions .

		All the regular
Baedeker	PERSON	features are included the introductory hints on railways , money , hotels , postal arrangements , etc. ; the specimen tours , con - venient arrangement of routes , diagrams and plans for ready reference , asterisks to denote excellence or importance , and the many other features that have made the
Baedeker	PERSON	guides models of their kind .

		Two or three points of special interest call for a word of mention .

		In comparing the railway trains of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the author reaches the conclusion of most travellers , that the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean system is probably the better for short jour - neys , but that our system '' reduces to a minimum the bodily discomfort and tedium of long railway journeys . ''

		We are also told that in the South and West the railway conductor is generally addressed as '' captain . ''

		-LRB- Why not '' colonel '' ? -RRB-

		The fol - lowing are hints to hotel-keepers desirous of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean patronage : '' The wash-basins in the bedrooms should be much larger than is generally the case .

		Two or three large towels are preferable to the half - dozen small ones usually provided .

		A carafe or jug of fresh drinking-water -LRB- not necessarily iced -RRB- and a tumbler should always be kept in each bed - room .

		If it were possible to give baths more easily and cheaply , it would be a great boon to English visitors . ''

		The statement that `` restaurants which solicit the patronage of ' gents ' should be avoided '' is excellent , but should have been extended to include tailors who offer to provide mankind with '' pants . ''

		We are given a glossary of the American language , with such definitions as these : '' Boss , master , head , person in authority . '' ''

		Bug , beetle , coleopterous in - sect of any kind . '' ''

		Mad , vexed , cross . '' ''

		Chicken , fowl of any age '' -LRB- the note of sarcasm should not escape an attentive listener -RRB- .

		The author has learned , with evident surprise , that in
America	LOCATION	`` weddings frequently take place in the
evening	TIME	, and are managed by a set of ' ushers ' chosen from the bridegroom 's friends . ''

		As for
Chicago	LOCATION	, those who object to the pronunciation -LRB- Shekdhgo -RRB- given the word , will forgive the author when they read , further down upon the page , that `` great injustice is done to
Chicago	LOCATION	by those who represent it as wholly given over to the worship of
Mammon	LOCATION	, as it compares favorably with many American cities in the efforts it has made to beautify itself by the cre - ation of parks and boulevards , and in its encourage - ment of education and the liberal arts . ''

		The author of Mr ''
Walter Lock	PERSON	' s recent biography The Christian of
John Keble	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is an ad - equate presentment of a man whose life was in every way interesting and inspiring .

		The book is not a large one , but it is well planned and well written .

		Mr.
Lock	PERSON	has evidently worked con amore .

		Such a life as
Keble	ORGANIZATION	's demands sym - pathetic interpretation as well as accurate chron - icling , and this biography really interprets its sub - ject .

		Keble 's early life , his importance in the Ox - ford Movement , his influence as a preacher and as an adviser , these phases of his life are faithfully portrayed ; his limitations are dwelt upon as dis - tinctly as are his points of strength .

		Keble 's atti - tude toward the Church of
England	LOCATION	and the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	in the stirring times of half a century ago is of course fully set forth .

		The book presup - poses some knowledge of Tractarianism , but anyone who knows the main facts of the movement will readily learn here its true spirit .

		And yet , has not Mr.
Lock	PERSON	taken for granted something it would have been better not to assume ?

		Many a man and many a woman , ignorant of Church history , have loved Keble through his work , and would gladly know him as he lived .

		For this large class of readers the present biography might have been made complete by a brief and explicit statement of the points at issue . ''

		The Christian Year '' is a term more familiar than Puseyism .

		In regard to
Keble	ORGANIZATION	's literary career , it is not strange that one thinks of it last . ''

		The Christian Year '' is poetry , and its author was Professor of Poetry ; but writing was to him only a means to diviner things than lit - erature .

		Yet not the least interesting chapter in the book is one on the
Prcelectioner Academical	ORGANIZATION	, the lectures on poetry that
Keble	ORGANIZATION	delivered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lectures have never been translated into En - glish , so Mr.
Lock	PERSON	's careful abstract of them is es - pecially valuable .

		In the present stage of criticism , we look to these discourses for loftiness of concep - tion rather than for authoritativeness .

		Keble had one ultimate criterion : a poet is in the first class or not , according as he possesses or lacks some one life-long potent feeling that appears in his work again and again .

		It is needless to comment on this theory further than to say that Mr.
Lock	PERSON	suc - cessfully applies the test to Keble himself , and shows that throughout his poetry there is a `` love of innocency '' which may be taken as the keynote of all he wrote .

		It was indeed the underlying prin - ciple of
Keble	ORGANIZATION	's life .

July 1	DATE	, The literature of
Persia	LOCATION	, ancient and A useful book on moc iern , offers several distinct fields , Persian Literature .

		.

		, , .

		.

		each oi a good deal ot interest to us Occidentals of the present day .

		The study of the Cuneiform Inscriptions , besides giving us one of the most interesting chapters in the history of scien - tific research , connects directly with our recollec - tions of the Old Testament and of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	.

		From another point of view the student of Comparative Religion and of Folklore finds , of course , in the '' Avesta '' the original sources for acquaintance with one of the earliest and most characteristic religions in mythological systems known to us .

		And in modern Persian Literature there is much of fasci - nation for one of more general interests .

		With
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's ''
Omar Kha	PERSON	` yya 'm , ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Sohrab and Rustum , '' and Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's '' With Sa ` di in the Garden '' still fresh in mind , we need not be reminded of the strangely charming literary characteristics which mark the work of
Firdausi	LOCATION	,
Omar	PERSON	, Sa ` di ,
Hafiz	LOCATION	, and
Attar	PERSON	.

		A His - tory of Persian Literature especially for English readers is thus an opportunity worthy of the scholar and the literary critic alike .

		Of this opportunity , Mrs.
Elizabeth A. Reed	PERSON	, in her '' Persian Litera - ture , Ancient and Modern '' -LRB-
Griggs	PERSON	-RRB- , has taken advantage , and has produced a popular manual of the somewhat discrete subject described by the title .

		Our chief criticism upon the work must be that it slights the modern Persian literature of which most of us mainly think when the subject is mentioned .

		But it is , on the other hand , very full in its treat - ment of the earlier periods , and includes an im - portant section upon the '' Koran . ''

		Mrs.
Reed	PERSON	's acquaintance not only with her special subject but also with other ancient literatures , notably the San - skrit , enables her to compose an account of the Cunieform Inscriptions and the `` Zend Avesta '' which stimulates curiosity and satisfies the interest .

		The work is beautifully printed , and has a gor - geous frontispiece in gold and colors , reproducing a portion of an illuminated ''
Shah Nameh	PERSON	'' manu - script .

		It is published uniform with the author 's admirable manual of '' Hindoo Literature . ''

		A correspondent Miss
Jewsbury	PERSON	's Letters to
Jane	PERSON	of
Jane Welsh Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- make
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		i_ii I N , up a bulky volume that does not call for extended notice .

		Miss
Geraldine Endsor Jewsbury	PERSON	was Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's most intimate friend and corresponded with her for a long time .

		The two agreed to burn each other 's letters , but Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	did not fulfil her part of the agreement , while Miss
Jewsbury	PERSON	did .

		So we have only the latter 's share of the correspondence .

		What Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's letters may have been we can partly guess and perhaps will not wholly regret their destruction .

		As to the letters before us , their value is not intrin - sically great ; they are diffuse , occasionally bright , occasionally witty , and always tender .

		They show the writer to be a woman of large capacity to love and to be loved , and of disappointment in the at - tainment of her ideals .

		Miss
Jewsbury	PERSON	wrote nov - els and reviews , but her letters are not literary .

		The only reason for publishing them is the light they might throw on the life of the
Carlyles	LOCATION	.

		But in the first place , from this selection we learn little that is new , and in the second place that little is materially dimished by the irritating mode of edit - ing , which prints a dash for almost every proper name .

		Not only should names be given , but there should be an abundance of notes , which the editor , Mrs.
Alexander Ireland	PERSON	, is able to supply .

		Her very readable life of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	showed her to be a capable worker in the field of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	literature .

		This last volume in that field should be brought up to the level of her former volume .

		The sympa - thetic sketch of Miss
Jewsbury	PERSON	's life is the most in - teresting part of the book .

		Seven lectures delivered last sum - S '' mer befOTe the
Plymouth School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	appear now in a vol - ume entitled `` Philanthropy and Social Science '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The first and second of the essays , by Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, entitled '' The Subjective Neces - sity for Social Settlements '' and '' The Objective Value of a Social Settlement , '' are interesting ser - mons in behalf of this new form of social organiza - tion in cities , with
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	as a text .

		The third , by
Robert A. Woods	PERSON	, discusses the '' Uni - versity Settlement Idea '' from the point of view of the
Andover House	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Father James 0 .

		S. Huntington contributes the fourth and fifth , which deal with the general principles of modern philanthropy in an incisive manner .

		The sixth is by Prof .


Franklin H. Giddings	PERSON	, on the `` Ethics of Social Progress , '' and is by far the most valuable and original contribution in the book .

		The last , by
Bernard Bosanquet	PERSON	, on the '' Principles and Chief Dangers of the Administration of Charity , '' is a brief statement of some of the commonplaces of scientific charity .

		While this volume contains much that is true and sensible , it lacks somewhat in con - tinuity and originality .

		These were - undoubtedly interesting and profitable lectures , but they touch only very superficially a few phases of the philan - thropic problem .

		They do not go deep enough for the scientific student , while the general reader can do better by devoting himself to manuals more spe - cific and extensive in information .

		Mr.
Oscar L. Trigg	PERSON	's ''
Browning	PERSON	and Whitman : A Study in Democ - racy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book that is more suggestive than conclusive .

		Democracy is de - fined as '' self-government , '' the '' absolute and free control of one 's self . ''

		All that tends to develop the soul to its freest , fullest limits , and all that tends to band together self-controlled individuals , is in its essence democratic .

		To point out these principles in the two poets is the object of Mr.
Trigg	PERSON	's analysis .

		Not a difficult task , surely ; for
Browning	PERSON	stands for the independence and preem -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 inence of the soul , and Whitman stands for the in - dependence and fellowship of man .

		Other writers are grouped with the two who name the book ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	, and the author says a great deal about them all that is penetrating and sympathetic .

		But he writes with the air of one who has a thesis to prove and a world to persuade , and the result is something partly one-sided and partly rhapsodical .

		The former effect is produced by his seeming lack of sympathy with poets like Words - worth ; the latter effect by the extremely large number of poetical citations .

		Out of 140 pages there are hardly a score that are not broken into by quotations .

		After a while this produces a mo - notony which materially and unjustly detracts from the author 's prose .

		All in all , the book is spirited and thoughtful , and if it does not persuade every - one to its wide-reaching optimism , it is because
America	LOCATION	is still far from being democratic in our author 's sense .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		THE second volume has just appeared of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History of the English People '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , in the magnificently illustrated edition that we owe to the painstaking scholarship and industry of Mrs.
Green	PERSON	and
Miss Norgate	LOCATION	.

		This installment carries us through the Reformation period to the death of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, two more volumes being necessary to complete the work .

		The illustrations are very numerous , a mere list of them , with brief descriptive notes , filling nearly thirty pages .

		It would be superfluous to praise the execution of this work , which is in all respects mechanically satisfactory .

		It should be found in every library , public or private . ''

		THE Yearbook of Science '' for
1892	DATE	-LRB- Dodd -RRB- , edited by Professor
T. G. Bonney	PERSON	, is the second issue of the series to which it belongs .

		The departments have been undertaken by the best specialist authorities , and the work offers a manual indispensable to every worker in physics or chemistry , in geology or biology .

		Refer - ences are given with unusual precision , and results are so concisely summarized as to permit the inclusion of a vast amount of matter .

		MR.
Francis H. Underwood	PERSON	's study of '' The Poet and the Man '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives us both a brief biography of
Lowell	PERSON	and a generous tribute to his per - sonal qualities .

		The author knew
Lowell	PERSON	quite inti - mately for nearly forty years , and , while his book gives us little or nothing that is absolutely new , it has the effect of bringing us very close to the lovable person - ality of its subject , and to make us realize afresh how worthy were the ideals for which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	stood , and how consistent was his devotion to their service .

		The vol - ume , which is an expansion of an article written for '' The Contemporary Review , '' is prettily printed .

		FOUR pamphlet sermons that come to us from the Rev.
James De Normandie	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, are of timely in - terest .

		Two of them are memorials , respectively of
A. P. Peabody	ORGANIZATION	and
Bishop Brooks	PERSON	.

		The others are on ''
Sunday	DATE	and the Columbian Fair '' and '' The Injustice to the Chinese , '' upon both of which subjects the author discourses with graceful and persuasive eloquence from the humane standpoint .

		We cordially commend these books to our readers .

		M.
Auguste Vacquerie	PERSON	and
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	have classified the con - tents into eight parts , corresponding with the seven strings of the ancient lyre , with the addition of an eighth suggested by a line of the poet 's , '' Et j' ajoute k ma lyre une corde d'airain . '' ''

		The Californian '' for
July	DATE	comes to us with a new cover , probably the most beautiful that has ever adorned an American magazine .

		It is printed in gold and col - ors , and has the
California	LOCATION	poppy , in leaf , flower , and fruit , for its characteristic ornament .

		The cover is made particularly charming by its wayward grouping of the poppy-blossoms , which are of natural size , and in no way conventionalized .

		The
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Dublin	LOCATION	-RRB- correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Academy '' has the following about one of our recent guests : `` The return of Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	from Amer - ica has relieved the College from some anxiety , for dur - ing his stay in the West he suffered from serious illness , which , though it did not stay or spoil his lecturing this was due to his indomitable character marred his enjoyment , and caused much alarm amongst his col - leagues .

		He is now restored to health , and he speaks in the strongest terms of the sympathy and hospitality of his American friends . ''

		The
London	LOCATION	house occupied for over half a century by
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	is to be sold .

		It may be said that there is scarcely a single representative of literature who during the first half of the present century was not a more or less frequent guest within its walls , from
Lord Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	down to
Thomas Campbell	PERSON	, Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	; and there is scarcely a single celebrity of that age in whose memoirs the hospitable breakfasts of
Sam Rogers	PERSON	and his constant '' Table Talk '' do not stand recorded .

		Mr.
Longworth	PERSON	, the British Consul at
Trebizond	ORGANIZATION	, re - ports that all books , pamphlets , and papers , even those for
Persia	LOCATION	, undergo the strictest censorship along that coast .

		Stationery is also examined for writings in invisible inks .

		Such as contain a likeness of the Sultan , disparaging remarks on Mahomedanism , or political reflection un - favorable to
Turkey	LOCATION	are condemned .

		The long list in - cludes Greek and Armenian proscribed books , besides thirty French and four English namely , the
Koran	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	's works , the handbook to
Turkey	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	, and the '' Pacha of Many Tales , '' by
Captain Marryat	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subscriptions to the
Shelley	LOCATION	memorial amounted to about
fifteen hundred dollars	MONEY	, of which more than 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, one-fourth came from this country .

		It is proposed to use the money as a foundation for an annual English literature prize at the
Horsham Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lady
Shelley	PERSON	's monument to the poet , at
University College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, was formally inaugurated by the donor a few days ago .

		A
Tennyson Memorial	ORGANIZATION	is now projected for Freshwater , in the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	.

		There are two propos - als before the projectors a committee formed in Fresh - water itself .

		One is to substitute for the existing wooden beacon on the highest part of the Freshwater Down a stone tower .

		The other is the erection of a granite monolith in the form of an lona cross at the corner of Farringdon-lane , along which the poet often walked .

		The committee ask for 500 .

		About half that sum has already been collected .

R. W. GILDER	PERSON	.

		THE CONGRESS OF A UTHORS .

		It is hardly possible , at a date when the Lit - erature Congresses have but just completed their work , to take anything like a philosoph - ical survey of the week 's proceedings .

		We have , however , thought it best , even at the risk of offering our readers an incomplete and im - perfectly digested report , to summarize the series of events that have made the week just ended noteworthy in the intellectual history of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		If we may not tell the whole story , and if our coign of vantage be too near the ob - ject for realization of the proper perspective , our report may at least embody the salient fea - tures of the Congresses , and point a possible moral here and there .

		As has already been stated in these pages , Congresses to the num - ber of five were planned for the week ending
July 15	DATE	, their subjects being Literature proper , Philology , Folk-lore , History , and Libraries .

		They have provided an intellectual repast be - wildering in variety , and quite beyond the as - similative powers of such rash mortals as may have attempted to partake of all the courses .

		They have been characterized by many notable contributions to both general and special cul - ture , as well as by many of those discussions and comparisons of diverse views from which a subject often receives more light than from some more formal method of treatment .

		The Congresses were happily opened on
Monday	DATE
evening	TIME	,
July 10	DATE	, by a general recep -
28	DATE	-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, tion given to such of the participants in the week 's work as had at that time reached the city .

		The reception began with the usual in - troductions and handshakings , and ended with a few speeches of welcome by representatives of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	, followed by responses from some of the more distin - guished guests .

		Under the latter category come the remarks made by Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	, Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, and Dr.
Max Richter	PERSON	.

		In the course of Mr. War - ner 's remarks , a tribute was paid to the beau - ties of the World 's Fair , and the speaker con - cluded with these words : '' I fear all the time that the Fair will disappear , and , as I say , I grudge every moment spent away from it , for it will go , like everything else that we have created by hand .

		And when it has gone these poor scribblers who have not money enough to create it and many of them not imagination enough to put it into poetry or into romance even because I do n't know anybody , except St.
John	PERSON	in the
Apocalypse	LOCATION	, who has hit it off at all so far these poor scribblers will have to take up the task of perpetuating this creation of beauty and of splendor , and the next generation that wanders about Lake
Michigan	LOCATION	looking at the ruins of
Chicago	LOCATION	the distant generation , of course will have to depend upon some wandering bard who even then wo n't be half paid , I dare say for the remembrance , for the description of the great achievement of this city of
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, in a few well-chosen words , con - trasted the literary art with the arts of form and color , pointing out that the very subtlety of the former makes its discussion difficult .

		Hence the speaker concluded that a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Au - thors must of necessity for the most part deal with the physical side of literature , with '' the relation of that art to its presentation through books to the public . ''

		Probably the most noteworthy incident of all this speech-making was to be found in the applause that inter - rupted Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	when he said : '' I , for one , would not have the countenance to stand up before a World 's
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	if within a short time we , as a nation , had not wiped out the unbearable disgrace of international piracy . ''

		The sentiment thus expressed by Mr.
Gil	PERSON	- der had many an echo in the subsequent pro- ceedings of the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Tuesday	DATE	session of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was devoted to the general subject of Copyright , and it was peculiarly fitting that Mr.
George E. Adams	PERSON	should serve as the presiding officer .

		The en - actment of the Copyright Law of
1891	DATE	was , as our readers will remember , largely due to the efforts of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, then a member of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		Major
Kirkland	PERSON	, who introduced Mr.
Adams	PERSON	to the audience , gracefully alluded to this fact , as did also Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, when his turn came to share in the gen - eral discussion .

		That the services of Mr. Ad - ams had been appreciated , and were still re - membered by those present , appeared in the ap - plause that followed every allusion made to them .

		The discussion was opened by the pre - siding officer himself , who read an admirable paper upon our copyright legislation , past and future .

		He took an eminently sane and prac - tical view of the question , making clear the fundamental distinction between a copyright and a patent -LRB- a distinction too often neg - lected -RRB- , but still averring that our future legis - lation is sure to be based upon the broad con - siderations of public policy rather than upon purely theoretical grounds . ''

		The question of the so-called moral right of an author in his book is not likely to arise in any future move - ment in this country for the enlargement of authors ' rights by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such legislation will be supported on the ground of public pol - icy rather than on the ground of just pro- tection of property . ''

		Dr.
S. S. Sprigge	PERSON	, late Secretary of the
London	LOCATION
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, followed Mr.
Adams	PERSON	with a brief paper on '' The
International Copyright Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' sent to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by Sir
Henry Bergne	PERSON	, the Brit - ish Commissioner at the
Berne Conference of 1886	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Sprigge	PERSON	also read a paper of his own upon the present complicated condition of copyright legislation , English and interna - tional .

		The remainder of the session was given up to an informal discussion , among the parti - cipants being Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
George W. Ca	PERSON	- ble , Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	,
Professor T. R. Lounsbury of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, President C. K. Ad - ams of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and Gen - eral
A. C. McClurg	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was general agree - ment among the speakers in deprecating the necessity of the '' manufacturing clause '' of the Act of
1891	DATE	, but there was an equally gen - eral agreement in the admission that the law , with all its defects , is vastly better than no law at all .

		Even Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, who pro- claimed himself one of the irreconcilables , ad - mitted the justice of this view .

		The injury done to writers by the condition of simultan - eous publication also came up for discussion , as well as the inadequacy of the term at pres - ent provided . ''

		Nearly all our great Amer - ican authors have outlived their copyrights , which is a ridiculous perversion of justice , '' said Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	; and Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, echoing the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 opinion , allowed his wit to play upon the thought , greatly to the delight of his hearers .

		The copyright question was again brought forward , at the
Wednesday	DATE	session , by Mr.
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	, editor of `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' who read a carefully prepared paper upon '' The Limitations of Copyright . ''

		We may also mention in this connection , as an il - lustration of the interest taken by foreign coun - tries in the work of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that a rep - resentative of the French Syndicat pour la Protection de la Propriete Litteraire et
Artis	PERSON	- tique placed in the hands of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, for distribution among the members of the Con - gress , a pamphlet '' Note sur 1 ` Acte du 3 Mars
1891	DATE	, '' especially prepared and printed for the purpose .

		After congratulating the
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	upon the successful outcome of its la - bors , the pamphlet adds : `` II ne saurait se presenter une occasion plus favorable que celle de la reunion du Congres de
1893	DATE	pour ex - primer les remerciements des interesses a tous ceux qui ont eu confiance en 1 ` esprit de justice du peuple americain . ''

		The special subject of the
Wednesday	DATE	session , `` The Rights and In - terests of Authors , '' was introduced by Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, who also presided over the session .

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's paper summarized the history of the
London	LOCATION
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, ex - plaining also the reasons for its existence and the difficulties with which it has had to con - tend .

		A recent editorial in THE DIAL , upon the subject of the Society , gave the principal facts embodied in Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's statement , and it is unnecessary to repeat them here .

		To the majority of those who heard them upon this occasion , they were doubtless new , and , as pre - sented by Mr.
Besant	PERSON	, they were given the added force that always characterizes a man 's spoken words upon some subject to which he has devoted years of active thought .

		The follow - ing is one of the passages of more general in - terest contained in Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's paper : '' We have made a careful and prolonged inquiry into the very difficult subject of the present nature and ex - tent of literary property .

		A writer of importance in our language may address an audience drawn from a hundred millions of English-speaking people .

		Remem - ber that never before in the history of the world has there been such an audience .

		There were doubtless more than a hundred millions under the Roman rule around the shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, but they spoke many different languages .

		We have now this enormous multitude , all , with very few exceptions , able to read , and all reading .

		Twenty years ago they read the weekly paper ; there are many who still read nothing more .

		Now that no longer satisfies the majority .

		Every day makes it plainer and clearer that we have arrived at a time when the whole of this multitude , which in fifty years ' time will be two hundred millions , will very soon be reading books .

		What kind of books ?

		All kinds , good and bad , but mostly good ; we may be very sure that they will pre - fer good books to bad .

		Even now the direct road to popularity is by dramatic strength , clear vision , clear dialogue , whether a man write a play , a poem , a his - tory , or a novel .

		We see magazines suddenly achiev - ing a circulation reckoned by hundreds of thousands , while our old magazines creep along with their old cir - culation of from two to ten thousands .

		Hundreds of thousands ?

		How is this popularity achieved ?

		Is it by pandering to the low , gross , coarse taste commonly attributed to the multitude ?

		Not so .

		It is mainly ac - complished by giving them dramatic work stories which hold and interest them essays which speak clearly work that somehow seems to have a message .

		If we want a formula or golden rule for arriving at popularity , I should propose this : Let the work have a Message .

		Let it have a thing to say , a story to tell , a living Man or Woman to present , a lesson to deliver , clear , strong , unmistakable . ''

		The demand for reading is enormous , and it in - creases every day .

		I see plainly as plainly as eyes can see a time - it is even now already upon us when the popular writer the novelist , the poet , the dramatist , the historian , the physicist , the essayist will command such an audience so vast an audience as he has never yet even conceived as possible .

		Such a writer as
Dickens	LOCATION	, if he were living now , would command an audience all of whom would buy his works of twenty millions at least .

		The world has never yet wit - nessed such a popularity so wide-spread as awaits the successor of
Dickens	PERSON	in the affections of the En - glish speaking races .

		The consideration must surely en - courage us to persevere in our endeavors after the in - dependence and therefore the nobility of our calling , and therefore the nobility of our work .

		But you must not think that this enormous demand is for fiction alone .

		One of the things charged upon our Society is that we exist for novelists alone .

		That is because literary property is not understood at all .

		As a fact educational literature is a much larger and more valuable branch than fiction .

		But for science , history everything except , perhaps , poetry the demand is leaping forward year after year in a most surprising manner .

		Now , in order to meet this enormous demand , which has actually begun and will increase more and more a demand which we alone can meet and satisfy I say that we must claim and that we must have a readjustment of the old machinery a reconsideration of the old methods a new appeal to principles of equity and fair play . ''

		The remainder of this session was taken up by a paper on '' Syndicate Publishing , '' sent by Mr.
W. Morris Colles	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, by '' Some Considerations on Publishing , '' a paper sent by Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, and by a discussion in which part was taken by Mr.
Besant	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Carleton Coffin	PERSON	, Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	, and Mrs.
D. Lothrop	PERSON	.

		The general subject of '' Criticism and Lit - erature '' occupied the
Thursday	DATE	session of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over this session Mr.
Charles Dud	PERSON	- ley
Warner	ORGANIZATION	presided , and read the opening paper , his subject being '' The Function of Lit - erary Criticism in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr. 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Warner	ORGANIZATION	's paper is so sound and so suggestive that we feel justified in reproducing a some - what lengthy extract . ''

		There seems to be a general impression that in a new country like the
United States	LOCATION	, where everything grows freely , almost spontaneously , as by a new crea - tive impulse , literature had better be left to develop itself without criticism , as practically it has been left every tree to get as high as it can without reference to shape or character .

		I say , as practically it has been left .

		For while there has been some good criticism in this country of other literatures , an application of sound scholarship and wide comparison , there has been very little of this applied to American literature .

		There has been some fault-finding , some ridicule , a good deal of the slashing personality and the expression of individual prejudice and like or dislike , which characterized so much of the British review criticism of the beginning of this century much of it utterly conventional and blind judgment but almost no attempt to ascertain the essence and purport of our achievement and to arraign it at the bar of comparative excellence , both as to form and substance .

		I do not deny that there has been some ingenious and even just exploiting of our literature , with note of its defects and its excellences , but it will be scarcely claimed for even this that it is cosmopolitan .

		How little of the application of universal principles to specific productions !

		We thought it bad taste when Mat - thew Arnold put his finger on
Emerson	PERSON	as he would put his finger on Socrates or on
Milton	LOCATION	.

		His judgment may have been wrong , or it may have .

		been right ; matter of individual taste we would have been indifferent to ; it seemed as if it were the universality of the test from which our national vanity shrank .

		We have our own standards ; if we choose , a dollar is
sixty-five cents	MONEY	, and we resent the commercial assertion that a dollar is
one hundred cents	MONEY	. ''

		It seems to me that the thing the American litera - ture needs just now , and needs more than any other literature in the world , is criticism .

		In the essay by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	to which I have referred , and in which , as you remember , he defines criticism to be ' a disin - terested endeavor to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought in the world , ' he would have had smooth sailing if he had not attempted to apply his principles of criticism to the current English literature .

		And this application made the essay largely an exposi - tion of the British Philistine .

		The Philistine is , in his origin and character , a very respectable person , whether he is found in
Parliament	LOCATION	, or in
Exeter Hall	LOCATION	, or in a newspaper office ; he is incased in tradition .

		The epithet , borrowed from the German , would not have stung as it did if
Arnold	LOCATION	had not further defined the person to be , what
Ruskin	PERSON	found him also in En - gland and
Wagner	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	, one inaccessible to new ideas . ''

		Now , we have not in the
United States the Philis	LOCATION	- tine , or Philistinism , at least not much of it , and for the reason that we have no tradition .

		We have thrown away , or tried to throw away , tradition .

		We are growing in the habit of being sufficient unto ourselves .

		We have not Philistinism , but we have something else .

		There has been no name for it yet invented .

		Some say it is satisfaction in superficiality , and they point to the common school and to Chautauqua ; the French say that it is satisfaction in mediocrity .

		At any rate it is a sat - isfaction that has a large element of boastfulness in it , and boastfulness based upon a lack of enlightenment , in literature especially a want of discrimination , of fine discernment of quality .

		It is a habit of looking at lit - erature as we look at other things ; literature in na - tional life never stands alone if we condone crooked - ness in politics and in business under the name of smart - ness , we apply the same sort of test , that is the test of suc - cess , to literature .

		It is the test of the late Mr.
Barnum	PERSON	.

		There is in it a disregard of moral as well as of artistic values and standards .

		You see it in the press , in ser - mons even , the effort to attract attention , the lack of moderation , the striving to be sensational in poetry , in the novel , to shock , to advertise the performance .

		Ev - erything is on a strain .

		No , this is not
Philistinism	LOCATION	.

		I am sure , also , that it is not the final expression of the American spirit , that which will represent its life or its literature .

		I trust it is a transient disease , which we may perhaps call by a transient name , Barnumism . ''

		Another paper of importance , sent by Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	-LRB- who was unfortunately absent -RRB- , had for its subject '' Criticism as an
Educational Force	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Speaking of the change that has of late years come over the spirit of criticism , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	writes : '' It was not until criticism passed into the hands of men of insight and creative power that it discovered its chief function to be that of comprehension , and its principal service that of interpretation .

		Not that it has surrendered its function of judging according to the highest standards , but that it has discovered that the forms of excellence change from time to time , and that the question with regard to a work of art is not whether it conforms to types of excellence already fa - miliar , but whether it is an ultimate expression of beauty or power .

		In every case the artist creates the type and the critic proves his competency by recogniz - ing it ; so that while the critic holds the artist to rigid standards of veracity and craftsmanship it is the artist who lays down the law to the critic .

		As an applied art , based on induction and constructing its canons apart from the material which literature furnishes , criticism was notable mainly for its fallability .

		As an art based on deduction , and framing its laws in accordance with the methods and principles illustrated in the best literature , it has advanced from a secondary to a leading place among the literary forms now most widely employed and most widely influential . ''

		Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, sent to the Con - gress a paper upon '' The Relations of Litera - ture and Journalism , '' from which we quote the opening paragraph : '' There never was a more promising subject for peo - ple who are fond of a good discursive debate , not likely to be brought to an abrupt and disappointing close by a sudden agreement between the disputants , than the subject of the relations between Literature and Journalism .

		A discussion of it combines almost every possible attraction ambiguity of terms , indefiniteness of area , uncertainty of aim everything in short that the heart of the most ardent controversialist could de - sire .

		I have been privileged to hear many such discus - sions and to take part in some of them , and on no oc - casion can I remember to have met with any debater so pedantic as to ask for a definition either of Literature or Journalism , at any stage of the argument .

		A sound
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 instinct seems to warn people that if they were to do that , the particular debate engaged in would immediately branch off either into a prolonged and probably tech - nical inquiry into the precise meaning and limits of the term Journalism or into an interminable and almost cer - tainly violent dispute as to what constitutes Literature .

		The latter question in especial is full of '' excellent dif - ferences '' for those who care to discuss it : because ac - cording to some theorists on the subject there would seem to be scarcely any written or printed matter when once you have risen above the Postoffice Direct - ory which is not literature ; while with the very super - fine class of critics , the difficulty is to find anything that is .

		Literature begins for the former almost where it be - gan with
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Anyone who could have '' pleaded his clergy '' in the middle ages , would in their view ap - parently have been a literary man .

		Between this esti - mate and that of the Superfine Critic who claims to confine the name of literature to some limited class of composition which he happens himself to admire , or perhaps affect , the gap yawns enormous : and I for one have no intention of attempting to bridge it .

		The true definition of literature no doubt lies somewhere between them ; and will be fixed on that auspicious day when it is found possible to determine the exact proportions in which Form and Matter enter into the constitution of literary merit .

		In the meantime we must content ourselves with admitting that form is certainly , if in an undefined degree , the more important of the two .

		It would be dangerous to admit any more than this in a day when so many minor poets are abroad ; for a con - siderable number of these , while particularly careful of form , have reduced the value of their matter to a van - ishing point , and any encouragement to them to carry the process yet further is to be strongly deprecated .

		Still this much , as I have said , must be admitted : that it is primarily form rather than matter which consti - tutes literature . ''

		Among other papers presented at the Thurs - day session was that sent by Mr.
Henry	PERSON	Ar - thur
Jones	PERSON	, who took for his subject '' The Fu - ture of the English Drama , '' and forecast it with an optimism quite excusable in the writer of so many serious and successful plays .

		While this session was in progress , the subject of '' Lit - erature for Children '' was under consideration in another hall of the building , and - papers were read by Mrs.
D. Lothrop	PERSON	, Mrs.
Elia W. Peattie	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	.

		In the
afternoon	TIME	, a programme of authors ' read - ing for children was carried out in the pres - ence of a very large audience , composed mostly of young people . ''

		Aspects of Modern Fiction '' was the gen - eral subject of the
Friday	DATE	session of the Con - gress .

		Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	was asked to preside , and the choice was no less happy than that of the chairmen for the three preceding sessions .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	followed the example of his predecessors in the chair , and read the opening paper , his subject being : '' The Uses and Methods of Fiction . ''

		We extract a pas - sage from the close of this paper : '' We live in a day unparalleled by any earlier time in its love and jealousy for truth .

		In no field of search after truth have we been more successful than in sci - ence .

		Our triumphs here have kindled in us such en - ergy and earnest enthusiasm , we have been tempted , both readers and writers , to forget that facts are not the only vehicle of truth .

		In our almost daily trium - phant search , through the simple study of facts as they are , for the human race 's betterment , we have learned to yield our imaginations too subserviently to the rule and discipline of the fact-hunters , and a depiction of desira , ble but as yet unrealized conditions across achasm os impracticability is often unduly and unwisely resented . ''

		The world will do well to let its story-tellers be as at their best they have ever been , ambassadors of hope .

		The fealty they owe is not a scientific adherence and confinement to facts and their photographic display , however benevolently such an attitude may be inspired , save in so far as they may help them the more delight - fully to reveal the divine perfections of eternal truth and beauty . ''

		Yet if it is true that there is no more law to com - pel the fictionist to teach truth than there is to require the scientist to be a poet , there are reasons why in more or less degree , and in the great majority of cases , he will choose to teach .

		One of these reasons lies on the surface .

		It is that in fictional literature , at least ,
Truth	ORGANIZATION	, duly subordinated to Beauty as the queen of the realm , is her greatest possible auxiliary and ally .

		No page of fiction ought ever to contain a truth without which the page would be more beautiful than with it .

		As certainly when truth ignores beauty as when beauty ignores truth , a discount falls upon the value of both in the economy of the universe .

		Yet on the other hand beauty in the story-teller 's art , while it may as really , can never so largely and nobly , minister to the soul 's delight without the inculcation of truth as with it . ''

		Hence it is that fiction 's peculiar ministry to the human soul is the prose depiction , through the lens of beauty , to the imagination and the emotions , of conflicts of human passions , wills , duties , and fates ; a depiction unaccompanied by any tax of intellectual labor , but con - sistent with all known truth , though without any nec - essary intervention of actual facts .

		Or , more briefly , it is the contemplation of the truths of human life as it ought to be , compared with the facts as they are . ''

		If this is the fictionist 's commission , is not his com - mission his passport also in the economist 's world ?

		It would be easy to follow out the radiations of this func - tion and show their value by their simple enumeration .

		In the form of pure romance it fosters that spirit of adventure which seeks and finds new worlds and which can not be lightly spoken of while we celebrate the dis - coveries of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		In all its forms it helps to ex - ercise , expand , and refresh those powers of the imag - ination whose decay is the hectic fever and night-sweat of all search for truth and beauty ; of science and inven - tion , art , enterprise , and true religion .

		Often it gives to the soul otherwise imprisoned by the cramped walls of the commonplace , spiritual experiences of life re - fined from some of their deadliest risks , and cuts win - dows in the walls of cramped and commonplace envir - onments .

		At its best it elevates our conceptions of the heroic and opens our eyes to the presence , actuality , and value of a world of romance that is , and ought to be , in our own lives and fates . ''

		Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	followed Mr. Cable with a paper on '' Form and

32	DATE	-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, tion in the Novel . ''

		We print a portion of Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's remarks , regretting that we have not space for them all . ''

		Whoever attempts a novel is supposed to have a story to tell ; and the manner of his telling it is almost as important as the story itself .

		It is always what - ever variations the theme may take the story of a man and a woman ; often a sad , often an absurd story ; but one which is as fresh with every generation as new grass with the
spring	DATE	.

		The dear little maid whom you now call the light of your house will soon reach her version of it .

		She tells you in confidence , and with a stammer on the long word , that she has a prejudice against boys , and you know what that prejudice in the course of a few years will do with the incipient men who are hanging May-baskets or doing sums for her . ''

		It seems to me the best form for this story is the dramatic form .

		We want intensified life .

		` It is the quality of the moment that imports , ' says
Emerson	PERSON	.

		Of what interest are our glacial periods , our slow transi - tions that change us we know not why ?

		Everyone can look back on many differing persons he has been in his time .

		And everyone is conscious of undeveloped iden - tities hampered yet within him .

		The sweetest and sin - cerest natures have repressions and concealments .

		It is the result of these things which makes the story of life .

		You may put a microscope over a man and fol - low his trail day by day ; but unless he reaches some stress of loving , suffering , doing , you soon lose inter - est in him .

		I delight in
Jane Austen	PERSON	for the qual - ity of her work .

		In the same way I enjoy the work of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		It is their dramatic grasp on the com - monplace which makes these realists great . ''

		The most dramatic treatment can not wholly present the beauty of one human soul , and the sternest analysis can not reach all its convolutions of evil .

		Shakespeare knew his human soul .

		When we are very young we complain that he pictures us unfairly ; but when we are older , we know .

		He took the great moments , that counted ; and presented his men and women intensely alive . ''

		I have heard there are authors who do not rewrite and condense , who set down at the first stroke the word they want to use ; the word which creates .

		But I never absolutely laid hands on one .

		The growth of a story is usually slow , like the growth of most plants .

		It is labor and delight , pain and pleasure , despair and hope .

		You can not escape a pang .

		You must abso - lutely live it through ; and then try it by the test of ridicule of common standards , by the guage of human nature .

		I heard a judge say when he was a college student he kicked all the bark off a log in the campus , and wore out the backs of a new pair of trousers , try - ing to write a poem ; and he made up his mind he was no poet .

		If the spirit of art had really been in him he would have recognized these agonies .

		It is not easy to speak the word except when it is easy ; when you have those moments of clear seeing and that condens - ing grasp of your material which sometimes pay for days of worthless labor . ''

		The remaining papers of the session were as follows : `` The Short Story , '' by Miss Alice French ; `` The New Motive in Fiction , '' by Mrs.
Anna B. McMahan	PERSON	; `` Local Color in Fiction , '' by Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	; and '' Ebb - Tide in Realism , '' by Mr.
Joseph Kirkland	PERSON	.

		The
Friday	DATE	session of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	seemed to arouse a more general public interest than any of the others , and was distinguished from them by the fact that all the papers presented upon this occasion were read by their authors .

		Our account has thus far dealt almost ex - clusively with the special subject of the Con - gress of Authors .

		When we consider the fact that this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has been the first of the sort to be held by writers in the English language , and the other fact that there existed in this coun - try no definite association of literary workers to take charge of the arrangements , there is reason to congratulate the committees in charge upon the outcome of their enterprise .

		To the non-resident
Committee of Cooperation	ORGANIZATION	, and particularly to its secretary , Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	, who labored long and strenu - ously for the success of the work , a special and hearty word of recognition is due .

		It is true that there have been many disappointments that some who should have taken part in the work declined the invitation to do so , and that others who had promised their help and their presence failed to come forward at the final moment , but , with allowance for all these mishaps , it must be admitted that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	achieved a distinct success , that its sessions were dignified and thought-provoking , that it attracted the serious attention of a considera - ble and influential public , and that it has paved the way for a better organization of author - ship , and a better understanding of literature both in its commercial and its artistic aspects .

		The proceedings of the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	will have many echoes in the periodical litera - ture of the coming weeks ; and , if they shall be subsequently published , as is hoped , in perma - nent form , their effect will be felt far beyond the moment , and is likely to make itself appar - ent both in predicable and in unpredicable ways .

		Of the four remaining Congresses of the week we have not , upon the present occasion , space to speak in detail .

		We must be content with saying that they brought to
Chicago	LOCATION	ex - ceptionally large gatherings of the four classes of specialists to whom appeal was made , in - cluding many European scholars of the first rank ; that their programmes covered a very wide range of original research ; and that , in spite of the tropical temperature of the week , and the counter attractions of the World 's Fair , they were attended by audiences commensurate with the interest and importance of what the proceedings had to offer .

		THE PUBLIC CAREER OF
CHARLES STJMNER	PERSON	.

		* Mr.
Pierce	PERSON	has brought to a successful con - clusion , in the third and fourth volumes of his '' Memoir and Letters of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, '' the story of the life of an eminent statesman , whose career was singularly useful in promot - ing moral ideas in the realm of politics .

		If
Charles Sumner	PERSON	failed to realize the full meas - ure of his ambition no one ever does it could not be said of him that he put his manhood in the balance upon the chance of winning the Presidency .

		Herein is a lesson for those who choose a public career with honorable aspira - tions .

		The volumes before us cover the period from
1845	DATE	to
1874	DATE	twenty-nine years of agitation and human activity of profound significance to mankind , during a portion of which it was un - certain whether civilization would be advanced or retarded .

		The year
1845	DATE	finds Sumner in the prime of manhood , fairly launched upon a professional career at the bar , which one can - not but believe , if no other claims had inter - vened , would have won high distinction .

		He was a favorite in society , the friend and asso - ciate of
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Hillard	PERSON	, and other liter - ary men at home , and a correspondent of men of distinction abroad .

		His broad culture and oratorical gifts made him a man of mark , con - cerning whom there was much prophetic spec - ulation .

		Conservatism , controling commerce , manufacturing , and finance , wooed him with assiduity .

		His abilities exerted to maintain the established order of things would have '' strengthened the bulwarks of society , '' and he would have been rewarded with her richest gifts .

		The temptation was great , but conserv - atism failed .


Charles Sumner	PERSON	elected to be an agitator for moral and political reform .

		When society became frigid , when the doors of the best houses were closed to him , he grieved and wondered much .

		Disfavor was mani - fested even before he became an Antislavery leader ; while he was advocating prison reform and promoting the aims of the
Peace Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Antislavery was only the last straw .

		The an - tagonism that resulted was bitter , unyielding , and far-reaching in its effects .

		At that day the refinement of
Boston	LOCATION	social life was most * MEMOIR AND LETTERS OF

		attractive , and charmed all who came under its influence . ''

		Such a society was like that of ancient
Athens	LOCATION	more than any other modern city can show , intellectual , consolidated , despotic over individual thought , insisting on uniformity of belief in matters which were related to its interests , and frowning upon novelties which struck at its prestige . ''

		During the Mexican War controversy Sum - ner criticised the course of Mr.
Winthrop	PERSON	in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and further widened the breach that had already been made in the ranks of the Whig party in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		We are told by Mr.
Pierce	PERSON	that it cost him friendships which he valued dearly , and secluded him al - most entirely from general society .

		`` It ended his visits at
Nathan Appleton 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tick - nor 's door was closed to him ; and when a guest at a party there inquired if Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	was to be present , the host replied , ' He is outside of the pale of society . '

		The feeling became so pervasive in
Boston	LOCATION	's '
Belgra	PERSON	- via ' that a lady living on Beacon street , who had in - vited Sumner with other guests to dinner , received a withdrawal of an acceptance from one of them when he found
Sumner	PERSON	was to be present , although he was not at all in politics , and had no personal grievance .

		Pres - cott , of gentler mood than his neighbors , though with no more sympathy than they in
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	's themes , still welcomed him in his home on Beacon street and to his
summer	DATE	retreat ; but the tradition is that he was obliged to select his guests with care when
Sumner	PERSON	was invited , lest the feast should be marred by unseemly behavior on their part .

		Longfellow and his wife , made of far finer mould than their kin or their class , were , in spite of their connection with Mr.
Appleton	PERSON	, as devotedly at - tached to Sumner as ever , and kept a chamber at his service ; but even they sometimes found it necessary to send him a warning from
Cambridge	LOCATION	that some one was with them whom it was not best for him to meet .

		Even his triumphant career his election to the Sen - ate and his fame as an orator did not soften this ani - mosity . ''

		It was undoubtedly this conservative influ - ence of the solid men of
New England	LOCATION	which changed Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's political course , and prepared the way for the fatal seventh of
March	DATE	speech .

		Because of his uusoundness on the tariff and tendency toward Antislavery views , the class represented by
Lawrence	PERSON	and the Appletons had preferred Clay for Presi - dent , much to his mortification .

		He strove to placate it , and succeeded so far that in
1848	DATE	they advocated his nomination .

		It is claimed that their support was only nominal , their real choice being General
Taylor	PERSON	, but it is certain that their influence over him was heightened rather than lessened .


Webster	PERSON	's opposition to the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	led many of the Con - science Whigs to look to him as a candidate , but
Sumner	PERSON	distrusted him and opposed his selection .

		He preferred
Corwin	PERSON	, whose happy 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, fortune it had been to speak the truth with fearlessness in the presence of a triumphant opposition one of a half-dozen great speeches illustrating the best of American oratory .

		Look - ing back upon the past , one can not but regret that closer relations were not established be - tween the brilliant Ohioan and the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts reformer , as the zeal of the latter would have stimulated the former to his best work , benefitted society , and changed the story of a life .

		The campaign of
1848	DATE	is one of the most cu - rious and instructive in American political his - tory .

		That the incongruous elements Free Soil Democrats , Conscience Whigs , and
New York	LOCATION	spoilsmen known as Barnburners led by
B. F. Butler	PERSON	and
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	which went to make up the
Buffalo	LOCATION	convention could fraternize , even for a day , was remarkable .

		We are told that '' Both the nominating body and the mass-meeting were animated by a profound earnestness .

		A religious fervor pervaded the resolutions and addresses .

		The speakers asserted fundamental rights and universal ob - ligations , and iu their appeals and asseverations sought the sanctions of the Christian faith . ''

		But for once the reformers displayed common sense , and used the personal prestige of the wily old partisan of
Kinderhook	LOCATION	and his ma - chine to promote their cause .

		What if Mar - tin
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	had their help in revenging him - self upon
Cass	PERSON	, and what if
1852	DATE	found But - ler and
Tilden	PERSON	and
John Van Buren	PERSON	and others of his followers turning their backs on those noble protests for freedom '' which made 1848 an illustrious year in American annals '' and supporting
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	for President , * opposition to slavery had made substantial gains and prepared the way for the struggle that followed the passage of the
Compromise Measures	ORGANIZATION	, what was really the death-grapple with the Oligarchy .

		We now see coming into greater prominence Sumner ,
Horace Mann	PERSON	,
Charles F. Adams	PERSON	,
Henry Wilson	PERSON	, and
R. H. Dana , Jr.	PERSON	, who placed
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in the van of the Anti- slavery movement , despite the opposition of the powerful merchants of
Boston	LOCATION	and
Webster	PERSON	.

		As the glory of the latter departed , the hero of the new crusade , also a great orator , was hailed with popular acclaim thus repeating the experience of every generation .

		*
Tilden	PERSON	and other
Barnburners	ORGANIZATION	, when secession was threat - ened , addressed the South in resolutions recognizing the right of slaveholders to carry their slaves into the territories and the justness of their grievances , which further heightens the insincerity of the
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	men in
1848	DATE	.

		Sumner 's career in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	is fresh in the recollection of our readers .

		His culture , industry , singleness of purpose , and perfect in - tegrity made him a true representative of the new North .

		When he spoke it was with a moral force surpassing that of all others .

		The world listened with respect .

		The opposition , enraged , struck back with brute force , to the injury of its own cause .

		During the administration of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	was an authority on all questions af - fecting our foreign relations ; but his devotion to Antislavery convictions often proved an em - barrassment .

		In common with others he mis - judged the President , underrated his capacity for leadership in such a crisis , and at times became impatient and censorious .

		He did not , however , as did
Henry Winter Davis	PERSON	,
Wade	PERSON	, and Chase , actively oppose Lincoln 's renom - ination , or seek to force him to withdraw in the midst of the campaign of
1864	DATE	, as did others .

		He said : '' If Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	does not withdraw , then all who now disincline to him must come into his support .

		I have declined to sign any paper or take any part in any action , because I was satisfied that nothing could be done except through Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	and with his good-will .

		To him the appeal must be made , and on him must be the final responsibility . ''

		This was early in
September	DATE	.

		In a letter to Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	,
September 18	DATE	, he expressed him - self more at length on this theme : '' The hesitation in the support of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	dis - appears at the promulgation of the
Chicago	LOCATION	treason .

		There was a meeting in
New York	LOCATION	of persons from dif - ferent parts of the country to bring about a new con - vention to nominate a Union candidate .

		The ' Tribune , ' ' Evening Post , ' ' Independent , ' and
Cincinnati	LOCATION	< Gazette ' were all represented in it ; but as soon as they read the platform , they ranged in support of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	... You understand that there is a strong feeling among those who have seen Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, in the way of business , that he lacks practical talent for his important place .

		It is thought that there should be more readiness , and also more capacity for government . ''

		... Chase for a long time hesitated in the support of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	; he did not think him competent .

		But he finds that he has no alternative ; as a patriot , he must oppose
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The President made a great mistake in compelling him to resign .

		It was very much as when
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		threw overboard
Necker	ORGANIZATION	, and by the way , I have often observed that Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	resem - bles
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		more than any other ruler in history .

		I once said to Chase that I should not be astonished if , like
Necker	ORGANIZATION	, he was recalled , to which he replied , ` That might be if Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	were king and not politician . '

		Thus far the President has made no overture to him of any kind , although he has received him kindly . ''

		But Mr.
Chase	PERSON	did make overtures through Governor
Brough	PERSON	, seeking a restoration , the relation of the particulars of which -LRB- if this
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 were the proper place -RRB- would prove our Pres - ident very unlike
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		He was in pos - session of evidence that the effort to create the opinion that he lacked capacity for government , and that he had lost public confidence , had been persistently made by some of the inti - mate friends of Mr.
Chase	PERSON	notably Senator
Pomeroy	PERSON	for months , and that the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Convention was a part of the plan to promote the ambition of that statesman .

		The head - quarters of the faction on Vine street ,
Cincin	PERSON	- nati , were not closed until it became apparent that the scheme to force Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	to with - draw would fail .

		Our author fails to see the motive behind this opposition to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, or the peril to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause in the midst of the campaign through the factious course of party leaders , an opposition that was kept up to within eight weeks of the election .

		He has fallen into error as to the attitude of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	'' Gazette '' and of the part taken by its able directing head at that time .

		The '' Gazette '' was not in sym - pathy with Mr.
Chase	PERSON	's views , and did not further his ambition .

		It did not indulge in captious criticisms of the President , but gave him loyal support .

		Its representative at the
New York	LOCATION	conference was undoubtedly there in the interest of harmony .

		It is true that its distinguished
Washington	LOCATION	correspondent , Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, was on terms of intimacy with Mr.
Chase	PERSON	, sympathized with the view of the situation taken by that statesman , Gov - ernor
Andrew	PERSON	and other earnest men , and par - ticipated in the movement having for its ob - ject the retirement of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Richard Smith	PERSON	, the editor , was not '' active in the movement , '' as our author says .

		There is a letter of his in the possession of a friend , written to a gentleman on intimate terms with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, frankly telling him that in a tour he had made through northern
Ohio	LOCATION	and Mich - igan in
August	DATE	he found a condition of apathy which threatened the defeat of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	ticket .

		He expressed the same views to the writer , who at that time was conducting the canvas for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	party in
Ohio	LOCATION	, and who assured him that the people were sound .

		This was the measure of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's opposition .

		The ma - jority for the
State	ORGANIZATION	ticket in
October	DATE	was over 56,000 , and for Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, a month later , over 64,000 .

		The Union successes only served to engross Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	's time more and more in behalf of the negro race .

		He would not only emanci - pate them , but confer upon them without prep - aration all of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship .

		In this regard he sharply an - tagonized the President and a majority of his party .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	had much at heart the reconstruction of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, with white suf - frage .

		He held that the radicals were attempt - ing '' to change this government from its orig - inal form and make it a strong centralized power . ''

		He is quoted by Mr.
Welles	PERSON	as hav - .

		ing said on the last day of his life , `` These humanitarians break down all
State	ORGANIZATION	rights and Constitutional rights .

		Had the Louisianians inserted the negro in their Constitution , and had that instrument been in all other respects the same , Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	would never have ex - cepted to that Constitution . ''

		The effort to carry out Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's views led to an acri - monious debate in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, in which Sum - ner appears to less advantage than on other occasions .

		To him belonged the responsibility of defeating the wishes of the President in the recognition of the
State	ORGANIZATION	government of
Louis	LOCATION	- iana . ''

		Sumner 's behavior , '' said his friend
Samuel Bowles	PERSON	, '' in preventing a vote on the
Louisiana	LOCATION	question was perfectly unjustifiable .

		I shall henceforth be intolerant of him , always .

		It was undignified , disgraceful . ''

		* A breach between the President and the Senator was predicted , but the former , by marked atten - tions to Sumner , gave public notice that he was not going to quarrel .

		Far different was his experience when Grant was President .

		The
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and
San Domingo	LOCATION	episodes , and his deposition from the chairman - ship of the
Committee on Foreign Relations	ORGANIZATION	, made a breach which could never be healed , and loosened the ties that bound him to his party .

		A satisfactory explanation of this treat - ment of a distinguished senator for independ - ence of action on a public question has never been made .

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	's plan of reconstruction came to be , after a struggle , the policy of his party .

		Theoretically it armed the emancipated negro withapower that should prove invincible against his former master , the power of the ballot , and it charged the general government with the responsibility of the execution of the law .

		To the party that adopted it , it has proved a veritable
Pandora	ORGANIZATION	's box ; to the whole country - injurious , as it has perpetuated sectional di - visions , intensified race prejudices , and lessened respect for law .

		Wherein has the negro been benefited ?

		What is his part in government as an elector ?

		such length as to cause the reader to lose the thread of the narrative , the whole making the reading exceedingly laborious .

		The va - riety of types used in printing the book , Roman capitals and lower case , italics , and full-faced letters , tends to still greater con - fusion .

		It is evident that the full-faced letters are resorted to for emphasis .

		The reason for setting up the text in small pica with para - graphs here and there in bourgeois is not so evident .

		The book does not justify its appear - ance at this time either by adding newly dis - covered facts in history to those known to stu - dents in theology , or by presenting the old mat - ter in any new light .

		The present volume was intended to be the first of fehree to take up that number of great epochs of
Church History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether or not the author 's death -LRB- since
Easter , 1891	DATE	, the date of his preface -RRB- has in - terrupted the preparation of the subsequent volumes does not appear .

		A book-buyer might be led by the title of Pro- fessor
Ramsay	PERSON	's recent book '' The Church in the Roman Empire before A. D. 170 '' and by its general appearance -LRB- it is an octavo of 480 pages with an index -RRB- to expect a narrative history of a certain phase of the early church promising much of deep interest in its devel - opment .

		Such a one would probably be sur - prised , without being disappointed , upon find - ing in the volume an exemplification of '' the method of applying archaeological , topograph - ical , and numismatic evidence to the investiga - tion of early Christian History . ''

		The volume bears as a somewhat misleading sub-title , ''
Mansfield College Lectures	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The six lec - tures delivered at
Mansfield College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, in
1892	DATE	, form , indeed , the basis of the book , but these lectures -LRB- themselves almost entirely re - written -RRB- include a chapter expanded from a lec - ture delivered at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	, and are preceded by a long excursus -LRB- divided into eight chapters -RRB- upon '' St.
Paul	PERSON	in
Asia	LOCATION	Minor . ''

		Therein the author supplements and corrects Conybeare and
Howson	PERSON	and
Dean Farrar	PERSON	in their biographies of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, from a topograph - ical study of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor , and he even corrects his own previously published '' Historical Geog -

		THE DIAL 37 raphy . ''

		He shows a like frankness in the man - ner in which he celebrates , in his preface , his breaking away from the German critics whom he followed for years with much interest and zeal , and whose results he accepted .

		In recent years , and with a better understanding of Roman his - tory , he has realized that it is a gross outrage on criticism to hold most of the books of the New Testament for second-century forgeries .

		Much of the work before us is directed towards this point .

		Dr.
Hurst	PERSON	's volume , '' Short History of the Christian Church , '' would take up nearly the same amount of shelf-room as Dr.
Moeller	PERSON	's , but it contains about a hundred pages more of text , besides statistical appendices and indices .

		Its typographical arrangement , however , is not so compact as that of the former volume , and if pains were taken to estimate the exact amount of verbal matter in each , it would probably be found that there was little difference .

		As - suming this result , it is interesting to note that Dr.
Hurst	PERSON	attempts to give a comprehensive view of nineteen centuries of Christian history in a space equal to that which Dr.
Moeller	PERSON	re - quires for setting forth six centuries .

		To the early Church , Dr.
Hurst	PERSON	assigns a century and a half more than Dr.
Moeller	PERSON	, and devotes 102 pages .

		His avowed purpose is to popularize the study of religious history .

		The qualifying part of the title to his work , in such a case , is made important .

		The author frankly tells us how he has prepared this volume .

		Its five di - visions are a careful re-arrangement and re - writing of five short histories by which he is already known to a certain class of readers .

		In the re-arrangement and re-writing , it seems to have escaped the author 's attention that the rather confused view of a very disorganized Christianity presented in the latter part of his volume is wholly inconsistent with the defini - tion of the visible Church with which he sets out . ''

		The visible Church , '' says he , '' con - sists of the organized believers in
Christ	LOCATION	and the followers of his life . ''

		We should be jus - tified in expecting a '' short history '' of the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	to keep this definition in view , so that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	might be clearly iden - tified in every period of its history .

		Certain phrases used by the author , e. g. , '' the
Evan	PERSON	- gelical Protestant Church , '' `` Evangelical
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , '' and '' the aggressive sisterhood of Pro- testant Churches , '' imply a reaching out after a term which shall be comprehensive of something , and yet non-committal as to the theories of the visible Church held by Latin or Anglican theologians ; though he repeatedly makes the blunder , common among ultra-Pro - testant writers , of calling the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	, its adherents , and its principles , '' Catholic , '' a sweeping concession of every claim the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	makes .

		The author would have avoided many difficulties in the way of writing a short history of the Church from his standpoint , had he entitled his work a '' Short History of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity . ''

		The chapters in the fifth division of his volume , devoted to a score or more of fan - tastic sects in no sense connected with the Church as he defines it , would not then appear so incongruous .

		An accurate terminology , however , does not seem to be a strong point with this distinguished writer .

		The words '' sect '' and '' schism '' are used as though convertible terms . ''

		Theo - tokos '' is defined as '' God-born '' on page 52 , and as '' Mother of God '' on page 386 .

		The term '' Roman Catholic '' is used under circum - stances which render it utterly meaningless .

		We are seriously told that , at a certain period of his life , Luther was '' a firm and full believer in the one
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Again -LRB- p. 247 -RRB- ''
Henry	PERSON	's -LSB- VIII . -RSB-

		real purpose was a Na - tional
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	with himself at the head '' ; and -LRB- p. 262 -RRB- mention is made of the desire of the French '' for a
National Ro	ORGANIZATION	- man Catholic Church . ''

		How such combina - tions of antagonistic Church polities could pos - sibly have been accomplished , even in the mind of a theorist , it would be interesting to know .

		Furthermore , omitting all reference to the ori - gin of the term '' Protestant '' -LRB- a serious omis - sion even in a short history of the Reforma - tion -RRB- , and failing to define the same , it is applied long before the occasion for its use arose , and indiscriminately afterwards , even to a class of modern religionists of the Baltic Provinces who have been deprived of privi - leges which the Czar of
Russia	LOCATION	seems to have it in his power to restore .

		This confusion of terms appears to result from confused ideas on certain essential historical points .

		Be that as it may , it is sure to lead to confused ideas in those who would derive their historical inform - ation from this book .

		If '' the Church of the Past '' is to be made '' a wise instructor for the Church of the Fu - ture , '' it is not only necessary that the events of history be accurately known by those who have the `` true historical instinct , '' but also that they be accurately related .

		Granted that Dr.
Hurst	PERSON	is not deficient in his knowledge of events , it is unfortunate that we should find 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, him '' nodding '' so frequently when he comes to relate these events .

		We are surprised that some of the errors -LRB- of which we may cite the following as an example -RRB- should have evaded detection .

		It was not to escape the general persecution under
Herod Agrippa	PERSON	,
A. D. 44	PERSON	, that '' the Christians took refuge in
Pella	LOCATION	, be - yond the Jordan '' -LRB- p. 17 -RRB- , but in immediate anticipation of the destruction of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	by the armies of Titus , A. D. 70 .

		That im - portant event is altogether erroneously nar - rated in the sentences immediately following the statement we have just corrected : '' Bar-cochba led a final popular Jewish revolt against the Roman authority , A. D. 132 , but was defeated by
Julius Sever	PERSON	us , and
Jerusalem	LOCATION	became a heap of ruins .

		The Roman emperor
Hadrian	PERSON	tried to destroy the at - tachment of the Christians to the sacred associations of the city by erecting on Calvary a temple to
Venus	PERSON	, and , over the Holy Sepulchre , a statue to
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	.

		But his ef - forts , while pleasing to the Jews , had no material effect . ''

		It is scarcely necessary to give a correct ac - count of these events , so well known is it to readers of history .

		It was the insult offered by
Hadrian	PERSON	to the religion of the Jews , in set - tling a Roman colony on the site of the
Holy City	LOCATION	which had been destroyed sixty-two years previously , that incited the revolt of Bar - cochba .

		Hadrian 's establishment of the city of ^
Elia Capitolina	PERSON	on the foundations of Jer - usalem , and a temple of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	on
Mount Zion	LOCATION	, were very far from pleasing to the Jews , and to the Roman city the Christians , who had been expelled by
Titus	ORGANIZATION	, were freely admitted with the first of their
Gentile Bishops	ORGANIZATION	.

		The utility of the work is seriously marred by omissions , of which a long list might be given .

		The organized existence of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	in
the fourth century	DATE	, independent of the See of
Rome	LOCATION	, having been frankly ad - mitted , the means by which
Rome	LOCATION	gained the supremacy , the continued protests of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	against the same , and the part taken by that
Church	ORGANIZATION	in the Reformation , are entitled to some attention .

		A paragraph is cer - tainly inadequate treatment of the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	, even in a short history , and the omis - sion of all mention of the Creed of
Pius IV.	PERSON	, and the consequent failure to define modern
Romanism	LOCATION	, are scarcely excusable .

		In rela - tion to the
Vatican Council	ORGANIZATION	of
1869	DATE	-LRB- which the author incautiously concedes to have been oacu - menical -RRB- , a magnificent opportunity for a clear statement of the decree of Infallibility is ig - nored .

		Such a statement would have con - veyed information on a subject often referred to but popularly little known .

		The suggestion of so many omissions might be taken to imply that the work should have been extended at the cost of its qualified title .

		On the contrary , however , the book would have been greatly improved by a regard for the rules of proportion , and the consequent omis - sion of much of its present contents .

		The ref - erences to hymnody are so filled with errors and are so inadequate , and a half-dozen or so chap - ters upon Missions , Religious Literature , and cognate subjects are so partial , that the space they occupy might have been used to better advantage in the treatment of more important historical subjects .

		The author 's prefatory misgivings regarding his treatment of the vari - ous American denominations are well founded , and suggest that the considerable portion of Part V. , devoted to not very satisfactory sketches of about thirty different denomina - tions , might have been profitably replaced by a comprehensive view of Christianity in Amer - ica .

		A general re-arrangement of the chap - ters would have been of great advantage .

		The present derangement -LRB- of which let this serve as a sample : In Part II. ,
Arnold of Brescia	ORGANIZATION	is treated of in Chapter XVI. ,
Abelard	PERSON	, who was his teacher , is treated of in Chapter XXVIII . -RRB-

		is calculated to mislead readers as to the chron - ological order of the events narrated .

		If we have been somewhat explicit in point - ing out the shortcomings of this work , it is be - cause we agree with the author , '' that the pop - ular taste for the condensed treatment of the secular sciences can be safely applied to the domain of
Theological Science	ORGANIZATION	, and to no de - partment with greater hope of success than to Historical Theology . ''

		We regret , however , that this book falls far short of .

		serving that popular taste as it should , and fails of being of educational value to the constantly increas - ing number of students of
Church History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's contribution to ecclesiastico-his - torical literature , '' The Anglican Church , '' is a monograph with a definite aim in view , thereby giving it a decided advantage over the much more pretentious works above reviewed .

		It is a modest duodecimo of 110 pages , con - taining a catena of proofs of the facts implied in the title , viz .

		that the Christian Faith was early introduced into the British Isles and has been continuously maintained therein .

		Its ar - gument is for the identity of the present Church of
England	LOCATION	with the organized Church which Dr.
Hurst	PERSON	admits was represented at the Coun - cil of Aries .

		It is an argument against both Romanists and Protestants , who , in the face of
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 such historic facts as
Magna Charta	LOCATION	, refer the origin of the English Church to the time of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book has all the elements of popularity save one .

		Its arguments are too convincing to meet with favor from those whose minds are made up against the claims of the
Church of England to Catholicity	ORGANIZATION	limited only by nationality .

		THE `` HERO OF NEW ORLEANS '' AND `` OLD ROUGH AND READY . ''

		* The second and third volumes of the '' Great Commanders '' series give sympathetic and in - spiring biographies of General
Zachary Taylor	PERSON	and General
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	.

		As the name implies , this series has a different purpose from that of the '' American Statesmen Series , '' even when , as in the case of
Jackson	LOCATION	, a biography of the same man appears in each series .

		This difference in purpose sufficiently appears from examination of the two lives of
Jackson	LOCATION	, when it is found that Professor
Sumner	PERSON	, who wrote the volume in the '' Statesmen '' series , has de - voted only 72 pages out of 386 to the events in the
General	ORGANIZATION	's life previous to
1824	DATE	, when he first ran for President , while Mr.
Parton	PERSON	, in the volume in the '' Great Commanders '' se - ries , gives 272 pages out of 326 to the same period .

		The life of
General Taylor	ORGANIZATION	follows a similar plan , and it will be readily seen that this difference in purpose makes the later series one which appeals strongly to boys and young men .


Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, the intolerant and vol - canic , but intensely patriotic , honest , and in - domitable man , is made to live again in Mr.

		the man stands forth as the only adequate ex - planation of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	the general and statesman .

		His faults are not covered up or explained away , and a boy must see them as faults ; but the essential greatness and manli - ness of his character and achievements are so clearly shown that , in spite of faults , he must be a rare American youth who can read these pages without feeling a healthful stimulus to his own manliness and patriotism .

		In
1812	DATE	, a year before General
Jackson	PERSON	took terrible revenge upon the Creeks for the massacre of
Fort Minis	LOCATION	, Captain
Zachary Tay	PERSON	- lor , then a young man of twenty-eight years , serving under General
William Henry Harri	PERSON	- son , made such a gallant defense of
Fort Har	LOCATION	- rison against a superior force of Indians led by the Prophet ,
Tecumseh	PERSON	's brother , that his superior in his despatches to
Washington	LOCATION	warmly praised him .

		From that time on , and indeed for some time previously , in
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,

Jackson	PERSON	had once been a campaigner and Gov - ernor -RRB- , in
Texas	LOCATION	at
Palo Alto	LOCATION	and
Resaca de la Palma	ORGANIZATION	, beyond the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	at Mata - moras , and finally at
Monterey	ORGANIZATION	and
Buena Vista	ORGANIZATION	, another American commander was slowly fitting himself for greater deeds and heavier responsibilities by quietly '' doing his duty . ''

		The evolution of the sturdy old soldier and pa - triotic American is lovingly traced by Major -
General O. O. Howard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , as in the life of
Jackson	LOCATION	, the man himself is introduced to us and we share his tent .

		The contrast be - tween the two men is striking .

		One is impet - uous , intolerant , radical , the other is poised , generous , and conservative .

		And yet , when need was , the aggressive boldness and uncon - querable will of `` Old Rough and Ready '' were not surpassed even by the '' Hero of
New Orleans	LOCATION	. ''

		The civic life of
Taylor	ORGANIZATION	is briefly but ade - quately told .

		Special prominence is given to his attitude toward the slavery agitation of that day .

		We are told that when , in
1850	DATE	, the President was approached by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	leaders to get him to join in their plan to , set up a southern confederacy with him as President ,
Taylor	PERSON	replied with true Jacksonian vigor and effectiveness that he would put down such an attempt '' with Southern volunteers . ''

		In Gen - eral
Howard	ORGANIZATION	's opinion , this answer postponed the '' irrepressible conflict '' ten years and made the ultimate success of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause possible .

		A good map of the battlefield of New Or - leans is given in the life of
Jackson	LOCATION	, and ex - 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, cellent maps of the
Texas	LOCATION	and Mexican battles are found in the other volume ; but a few good general maps , covering the whole field of mil - itary movements described , would add to the reader 's interest and profit .

		RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY .

		* It seems odd to begin an article upon '' Recent Books of Poetry '' with a paragraph devoted to '' Poems by

		That modest collec - tion of youthful exercises in verse , now reproduced -LRB- as to title-page and arrangement -RRB- in fac-simile , is mainly useful in enabling us to realize the immense range of the conquests of Victorian Poetry .

		The year of its publication -LRB- 1827 -RRB- was also that of the appearance of
Pollok	PERSON	's '' Course of Time , '' mark - ing the lowest ebb of the tide of dull eighteenth - century didacticism .

		avoid the influence of the accomplished fact , it is difficult to find in this volume any suggestion , much less any promise , of what was to come .

		Here and there we find a faintly Tennysonian phrase , such as '' Groves of undulating pine , Upon whose heads the hoary vapours hung , '' or this : The tnun -LRB- j er of the Drazen prows O'er
Actium	LOCATION	's ocean rang , '' or this : '' A wan , dull , lengthen 'd sheet of swimming light Lies the broad lake . ''

		But what we find for the most part are the plati - tudes of boyish rhetoric , and echoes of Byron or
Moore	PERSON	.

		It is amusing to think that any work signed by
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	should deserve no better de - scription than is given by the phrase , '' an echo of
Moore	PERSON	. ''

		Four pieces not included in the original edition are now first published from manuscript .

		They enrich English literature by such measures as 41 Fare thee well !

		for I am parting To the realms of endless bliss ; Why is thus thy full tear starting ?

		There 's a world more bright than this . '' ''

		Timbuctoo , '' the prize poem of
1829	DATE	, which the publishers have also added to the collection , is a dif - ferent matter .

		Here we can find our own Tennyson in many passages .

		The following has often been quoted , but is worth quoting again : '' The clear galaxy Shorn of its hoary lustre , wonderful , Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light , Blaze within blaze , an unimagin 'd depth And harmony of planet-girded suns And moon-encircled planets , wheel in wheel , Arch 'd the wan sapphire . ''

		Indeed , the growth in power of poetic expression that is evidenced by these and many other lines of '' Timbuctoo , '' when compared with the best of the '' Poems by
Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' is one of the most striking things in all the record of the development of poetical genius . ''

		King Poppy , '' a posthumous poem by the
Earl of Lytton	ORGANIZATION	, was written nearly twenty years ago , and subjected , during the rest of the author 's lifetime , to constant revision and improvement .

		It was the author 's favorite work , and exhibits , at their highest stage of development , his considerable powers as a writer of philosophic and fanciful verse .

		In
1880	DATE	, he wrote of the poem to this effect : '' The purpose of it , so far as it has any definite purpose , is not to prove that all is vanity , but to suggest what a poor tissue of unreality human life would be if the much despised influence of the imagination were banished from it .

		I think that the practical tendency of all the most popular formulas of social and political improvement is to exclude the imagin - ative element from the development of character and society , and to ignore its influence ... Holding this view , it was a relief to me to write ' King Poppy , ' and a sort of whimsical enjoyment to contemplate my own image of the perfection of government conducted by a puppet .

		Apart from this , the more purely literary idea I had in this poem was to shape out vaguely a sort of Golden Legend from the most venerable and familiar features or fragments of the fairy tales and ballads which float about the world , and which our wise generation relegates to the nursery . ''

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 We select the following lines from the introductory '' Legend , '' as well representing the charm of the work in its more poetical passages : '' There is a legend , the low-breathing wind In Spring-time whispers to the trees and flowers , That some good gift on every flower and tree A guardian god or goddess once bestow 'd .

		Pan made the reed melodious : Artemis With mystic influence fill 'd the moon-fern : Zeus The cypress , Cybele the pine , endow 'd With solemn grace : blithe Dionysus pour 'd The strength of his indomitable mirth Into the sweet orbs of the cluster 'd vine : Ethereal azure from
Athene	PERSON	's eyes The dim veins of the violet imbued With pensive beauty : Cythereia 's kiss Crimson 'd the balmy bosom of the rose : Leaf of unfading lustre Phoabus gave To the green laurel : washt in
Herd	ORGANIZATION	's milk , White shone the immaculate lily : and the ripe corn
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	robed in oriental gold . '' ''

		The Eloping Angels '' is entirely unworthy of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's talents .

		That the author of '' Words - worth 's Grave '' should have wasted his time in the composition of a skit like this is simply amazing , and that he should have heen willing to give it pub - lication is still more amazing .

		The piece is evi - dently intended to he semi-humorous , but the hu - mor is elephantine , and the author 's wit nearly always misses fire .

		Humor that does not warm and wit that does not illuminate , are things '' most tol - erable and not to be endured . ''

		The best comment upon the work is provided by its own text : '' This sort of prank , to me , is rather tame . ''

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's good work is so very good that it is doubly a pity that he should publish anything so far below the level of his better self .

		Mr.
T. E. Brown	PERSON	, the author of `` Old John and Other Poems , '' is at least no imitator of other men 's work .

		His manner , freakish to eccentricity , is all his own , although a superficial view might find it to resemble the manner of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Much of his verse is too utterly formless to deserve seri - ous consideration , and yet there often emerges from the seeming chaos some ethical message that is startling in its directness and its force .

		We also note in his work a vein of mysticism that is not without impressiveness .

		As an illustration of the author 's more eccentric manner , we may take some very original verses from a poem which preaches upon a frequently recurring theme that of the need of man 's soul to get back to nature , to escape from the coil of a complex civilization and the sophistications of art . ''

		The main purport of our earthly station , Which is to permeate One soul with fullest freight Of constant natural forms , not factual complication . ''

		Else were our life both frivolous and final .

		A mere skiomachy , Not succulent of growth , not officinal To what shall after be , But Fortune 's devilry Of Harlequin with smirk theatro-columbinal . '' ''


Israel	LOCATION	and Hellas '' is the title of one of the finer poems in the collection .

		It contrasts the two civ - ilizations much as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was wont to do , although our later poet half doubts if the contrast were as great as it appears to us .

		We quote four stanzas that embody the central thought of the poem . ''

		And was it possible for them to hold A creed elastic in that lightsome air , And let sweet fables droop in flexile fold From off their shoulders bare , Loose-fitting , jewel-clasped with fancies rare ? ''

		For not as yet intense across the sea Came the swart Hebrew with a fiery haste ; In long brown arms entwined Euphrosyne , And round her snowy waist Fast bound the Nessus-robe , that may not be displaced . ''

		Yes , this is true ; but the whole truth is more ; This was not all the burning Orient gave ; Through purple partings of her golden door Came gleams upon the wave .

		Long shafts that search the souls of men who crave ; '' And probings of the heart , and spirit-balm , And to deep questionings the deep replies That echo in the everlasting calm All this from forth those skies ,
Beside Gehenna	ORGANIZATION	fire and worm that never dies . ''

		There is a large philosophy of life embodied in some of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's pieces , the stanzas to '' Pain '' offer - ing a notable illustration .

		They open thus : '' The man that hath great griefs I pity not ; 'T is something to be great In any wise , and hint the larger state , Though but in shadow of a shade , God wot ! ''

		Moreover , while we wait the possible , This man has touched the fact , And probed till he has felt the core , where , packed In pulpy folds , resides the ironic ill . ''

		This is the close of the poem : '' But tenfold one is he , who feels all pains Not partial , knowing them As ripples parted from the gold-beaked stem Wherewith God 's galley onward ever strains . ''

		To him the sorrows are the tension-thrills Of that serene endeavor Which yields to God forever and forever The joy that is more ancient than the hills . ''

		This is the deeper optimism that we find in
Brown	PERSON	- ing , or in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's doctrine that not happiness but blessedness is the true aim of life .

		Enough has been said to show that Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's work will repay study , that within its husks there may be found a sweet and nutritious kernel .

		The past year has brought many contributions of verse to its central Columbian theme , verse that has ranged all the way from the wooden epics of Mr.
Kinahan Cornwallis	PERSON	to the lyrical measures of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's '' Commemoration Ode . ''

		Mr.
Louis James Block	PERSON	is the latest contributor to this
Colum	PERSON	- bian literature , and his work takes the form of a sort of versified Culturgeschichte , having the dis - covery of
America	LOCATION	for its main episode .

		In spite of a few defects a defective line now and then or an imperfect rhyme , an archaism or a verbal li - cense that occasionally goes beyond the limits of the admissible , a mysticism and a vagueness of ex - 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, pression that sometimes lapses into obscurity , in spite of these things , we think that Mr.
Block	PERSON	has produced a very noble poem , a poem not unworthy of its great theme , and that stands in eloquent con - trast to many efforts that we will not for a moment draw from kindly oblivion by naming .

		Mr.
Block	PERSON	's poem is in four sections '' The Old World , '' '' The Man , '' `` The Deed , '' and `` The New World '' with a dedication to the `` Women of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The first and last sections , with their poetic charac - terization of the supreme moments of history , show the author 's work at its best , for they afford him the most opportunities for the fine philosophical gen - eralizations towards which he is led by his natural bent .

		As an illustration of this , as well as of the complex structure of the whole poem , we quote the stanza which sums up the part of
India	LOCATION	in the his - tory of ancient culture : '' Under the fervid skies , and mid the growth Of tangled forests where the mountains vast Circle the shaded glens , a gloomy past Enwraps a nobler people ; ever loth To grasp the present firmly , seeing both The worlds of earth and heaven in mist of dreams Enrobed and mingled , they seemed bound by oath Of high allegiance to the One who gleams Recedingly on the gaze Turned Himwards ; by what ways Of severence from the body , down what streams Of anguish did they seek Him ; the land teems With monstrous shapes and visions that enthrall ; And chiefly thee ,
Buddh	PERSON	, the foiled ones call Savior and friend , thee clothed in contemplation 's rest , And finding loss of all and nothingness the best . ''

		Felicitous passages abound in the poem . ''

		People grown strong with very sight of God , '' gives admirable expression to the ethical mission of the Hebrew . ''

		Freedom awoke with
Greece	LOCATION	, And violet-crowned peace ; The soul was born and thought 's first victory won , '' is both exquisite and adequate .

		The following fine tribute is paid to
England	LOCATION	: '' stern-browed Heroine far across the sea , Your daughter knows your blood within her veins , And hearkens to the ever-ringing strains Your voice has poured to honor liberty . ''

		Indeed , the whole poem is a song of the conquests of liberty , and closes in a vein that seems inspired by
Shelley	PERSON	's outburst : '' Oh , happy earth , reality of heaven ! '' ''

		One vision more ! ''

		sings the author , '' One vision more !

		the spiritual city lies Beneath the sun ; the all-subduing love Inhabits there as in the realms above ; As lordly as the blue unclouded skies Life passes , and the mighty dawn 's surmise Reaches completion , and the deeps on deeps Of spirit which are seen alone of eyes Whose watch is kin to power that never sleeps Are more and more revealed ; The inmost heavens unsealed Comfort the heart where no more anguish weeps , And open fields which faith forever reaps . ''

		The dramatic element , rather than the lyrical , is the characteristic component of Mr.
Fawcett	PERSON	's '' Songs of Doubt and Dream . ''

		The best of the poems are those either dramatic in form , as '' Two Scenes in the Life of
Beau Brummell	LOCATION	, '' or in spirit , as the fine narrative of '' Queen
Christina	PERSON	and De Liar . ''

		Hence we question the propriety of speci - fically styling the volume a collection of songs .

		The spontaneous grace and melody of the true lyric are qualities rarely exhibited in Mr.
Fawcett	PERSON	's verse , but we have instead abundant energy devoted to a wide range of themes .

		We are inclined to think that the author has weighted his verse with more phil - osophy than it will bear , or rather , perhaps , that his philosophy has not been sublimed in the proper alembic ; it is often crude and merely prosaic in expression .

		The memorial verses to
Courtlandt Palmer	PERSON	are excellent in thought and sympathy , yet we can hardly call poetry such lines as these : '' Ye men that bow to science as your god Learn self-control and patience from her laws .

		Remember
Newton	PERSON	and
Copernicus Killed	ORGANIZATION	superstition with the sword of truth ; They did not scare it dead with rhetoric ; Hysteria never framed a syllogism , And logic murders like a gentleman . ''

		The '' dream '' of Mr.
Fawcett	PERSON	's title , as well as the '' doubt , '' is justified by many pieces , from which we select , as among the more successful , '' A Retro - spect . '' ''

		Wandering where mortals have no power to gauge The enormity of night that space outrolls , Floated or paused , in shadowy pilgrimage , Two disembodied souls . ''

		One towered a shape with dark wild-trailing shroud , With face by sorrow and anger seamed and drawn ; One loomed a holy glory , as when some cloud Swims deep in baths of dawn . ''

		World after world they gazed on , till beguiled They flew toward earth , and hovering where she swept , One with a saturnine dejection smiled , And one with slow tears wept . ''

		` On that star , ' said the spirit of sombre mien , ' As Dante I passed through pain 's most blinding heats ... ' On that star , ' said the spirit of look serene , ' I suffered , and was
Keats	PERSON	. ' ''

		There are in these lines echoes of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Aldrich	PERSON	, at least , and the felicity of several words -LRB- guage , enormity , loomed , dejection -RRB- may be ques - tioned , but the poem has merits , and is not unim - pressive .

		We have found nothing prettier or more nearly faultless in the volume than this '' Aqua - relle '' : '' Far away westward the cattle go , Dotting the land 's dim edges ; Isled in the roseate afterglow , Darken the long cloud-ledges . ''

		Burning each moment with warmer beams ,
Moon	PERSON	, by your sweet chaste power Lull the world into lotus-dreams , While you hang like a lotus-flower . ''

		On the whole , Mr.
Fawcett	PERSON	's volume comprises the best work in verse that he has yet given us , and fairly entitles him to a place among our American poets of the second rank .

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's new volume has the general charac teristics of its predecessors the cloying imagery and the verbal trickery ; but we hear at times a stronger note than he has been wont to sound , a graver , if a no less passionate , strain .

		There is stil too much of this sort of thing : '' Fly out with flirt and fluting As flies a falling - star From flaming star-beds shooting , From where the roses are , '' but there are also verses like these : '' Once when the morning on the curling breakers , Along the foaming sand , Flashed expectation , by the ocean 's acres , Love took command .

		`` And so we sailed , ^ Eolian music melting Around our silken sails ; The bubbled foam our prow of sandal pelting With rainbow gales . ''

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's Muse , in her less exuberant moods , gives promise of excellent things .

		One does not expect very much from undergrad - uate college verse . ''

		Under the Scarlet and Black '' is perhaps deserving of a word of mention as the first book of verse that has yet hailed from a West - ern college , for the collection comes to us from
Grinnell	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The honors of the volume are borne off by Miss
Mary Bowen	PERSON	and
Miss Bertha Booth	PERSON	-LRB- both of this year 's class -RRB- , and , after some hesitation , we select a piece by the former writer a sonnet '' To
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	'' : '' A harp ^ Eolian on a lonely sill Was placed to feel the subtle wind 's soft touch .

		Perhaps its strains were burdened overmuch With Nature 's sadness and her discords ; still , Responsive to its master 's touchless thrill , It told the clover 's whisper to the breeze , The wordless plaint of wind-swept winter trees , With melody unknown to human skill .

		So in the quiet of a life apart From other lives , their passion and their pain , The hand of Nature touched thy tuue 'd heart , And , lo , thou utterest in simple strain A song too thought-rich for a fettered art , Yet bearing ever
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's sad refrain . ''

		Professor
Newton M. Hall	PERSON	introduces the volume with a brief sketch of journalism in
Iowa College	LOCATION	.

		We have hardly found anything as good as the above sonnet in '' Cap and Gown , '' although Mr.
J. L. Harrison	PERSON	, the editor , has chosen his contents from some forty college papers .

		Most of his pieces are love lyrics of a somewhat callow sort , written in the exotic verse-forms that seem so easy , yet in which real success is reached only by the mas - ters .

		The verses to
Eleanor	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. H. Boyn	PERSON	- ton , are perhaps as successful as anything in the collection . ''

		I do not think she loves me yet , Her glance meets mine direct and free ; Its very sweetness seems to set A bar between herself and me . ''

		I never touched her lips with mine , I dare not dream I ever may ; Still when I come her eyes will shine , And soften when I go away .

		`` Some hours I can not well forget , Perhaps she may remember too .

		I knew I loved her when we met , She never seemed as others do . ''

		I loved to watch her flushing cheek , Her soft hair carelessly astray , To see her smile , to hear her speak , And still have loved her every day . ''

		I do not think she loves me yet , I dare not think she ever may ; I know I loved her when we met , And still have loved her every day . ''

		The binding of this volume , with its hydrangea - decorated covers , is original and exquisite enough to call for a special word of praise .

		^ The title-page of '' Under King Constantine '' gives us no author 's name , but we understand the authorship of the book has been acknowledged by Mrs.
Spencer Trask	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Trask	PERSON	has undertaken the hazardous experiment of writing Arthurian idyls , and her little volume comprises three such poems narratives expanded from hints in
Malory	LOCATION	.

		A passage describing the vision of the Grail will show the character of the verse : '' One night at
midnight	TIME	came the ray again , And with it came a strange expectancy Of spirit as the light waxed radiant .

		The cell was filled with spicy odours sweet , And on the midnight stillness song was borne As sweet as heaven 's harmony the words The same Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	had heard of old ' Honour and joy be to the
Father of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	. '

		With wide eyes searching his lone cell for cause He waited : as the ray became more clear And more effulgent than the mid-day sun , He trembled with that chill of mortal flesh Beholding spiritual things .

		At last Now vaguely as though veiled by light , and then With shining clearness , perfectly he saw The sight unspeakable , transcending words . ''

		The purpose of Mrs.
Trask	PERSON	's verse is serious and sincere , but the execution is amateurish , and an ex - tremely qualified praise is all that can be given the volume .

		Mr.
Richard Hovey	PERSON	's '' Seaward '' is an elegy , in forty-five seven-line stanzas , upon the late
Thomas William Parsons	PERSON	.

		It is elaborate in construction and extremely discursive in treatment .

		We quote one of the stanzas : ' But who is this that from the mightier shades Emerges , seeing whose sacred laureate hair Thou startest forward trembling through the glades , Advancing upturned palms of filial prayer ?

		Long hast thou served him ; now , of lineament Not stern but strenuous still , thy pious care He comes to guerdon .

		Art though not content ? ''

		Dne of Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's notes obligingly informs us that , he reference of this passage is to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		A study of
Parsons	PERSON	, reprinted from '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' serves , with the notes , to thicken the booklet into what may be called a volume .

		Professor
William Hyde Appleton	PERSON	, of
Swarth	LOCATION	- more College , has made and annotated a collection f translated passages of Greek poetry , naming the volume '' Greek Poets in English Verse , '' and sup - 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, plying an introduction of no great value .

		The in - troduction , in fact , is little more than a summary of the Homeric poems and three or four selected tragedies .

		It is not noticeably critical , and lapses into the style sophomoric .

		We may remark inci - dentally that '' deeper than ever plummet sounded '' is not a quotation from any author known to us .

		Mr.
Appleton	PERSON	's volume is intended as an aid to the `` classical course in English '' of which overmuch is nowadays heard from university extension lecturers .

		The idea of such courses is an excellent one , pro- vided only they fall into the right hands , but the attempts thus far made to give them seem to have been unfortunate .

		Mr.
Appleton	PERSON	's selections include copious extracts from Homer and the four dram - atists , and many short passages from the lyric and elegiac poets and the Anthology .

		We are aware that in any work of this sort much allowance should be made for the tastes of the compiler , and that no collector of elegant extracts -LRB- not even Mr.
Pal	PERSON	- grave -RRB- ever quite satisfied all his readers .

		But Mr.
Appleton	PERSON	has missed so many of the things that ought to have gone into his book that we must ven - ture a word of unfavorable comment .

		His fear '' that some one of his readers may miss the very thing that he hopes to find '' is only too well war - ranted , for is it possible that any reader should not have hoped and confidently expected to find , in the Homeric section ,
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Achilles over the French '' ?

		`` Language as divine almost as Homer 's own , '' Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	calls it , and whatever else was omitted , surely that ought not to have been .

		Another omission as conspicuous is that of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's translation of the chorus from the '' Birds . ''

		Compared with that , all other translations from Aristophanes -LRB- even Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's version of the ' Clouds ' chorus -RRB- are simply nowhere .

		When we add that neither the '' Agamemnon '' of
Browning	PERSON	or of
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	is represented , and that
Calverley	PERSON	's '' Theocritus '' is wholly ignored , we feel justified in asserting that Mr.
Appleton	PERSON	's work is not done as well as it should have been .

		The late
John Osborne Sargent	PERSON	, lawyer and journalist , was a life-long lover of
Horace	PERSON	, and a man singularly fitted by temperament to sympa - thize with the Horatian point of view .

		During the last ten years of his life , he devoted his leisure hours to the translation of his favorite poet , and the work , which includes all but a dozen or so of the odes , is now published by his daughter , Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	contributing an introduction .

		The volume must be reckoned among the best of the many attempts to perform the alluring but diffi - cult task of Horatian translation .

		Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	commands a variety of metrical forms , and his most satisfactory work is done in the grave iambic measures chosen for the more serious of the odes .

		We may take as an example the '' Exegi monnmen - tum sere perennius '' : `` A monument more durable than brass Of height no regal pyramids surpass , I have achieved a work that will outlast The waste of waters or the northern blast .

		I shall not wholly die , but much of me , My better part shall reach posterity .

		No flight of seasons shall obscure my name , But serial ages shall increase my fame .

		While to the Capitol , to
Time	ORGANIZATION	's last day , Pontiff and vestal tread the sacred way , It shall be told of one of humble birth , Now potent with the magnates of the earth Bred where he heard
Ofanto	PERSON	's torrent roar , When Daunus ' subjects ploughed its arid shore That he first wed to him that praise belongs ^ Eolian measures to Italian songs .

		With guerdon crown desert ,
Melpomene	LOCATION	, And give the Delphic laurel wreath to me . ''

		If Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's versions are often inadequate , they are at least never undignified or lacking in either taste or feeling .

		He has fairly escaped the beset - ting sin of many Horatian translators that of vul - garizing their original .

		Mr.
James Rhoades	PERSON	, whose version of books I. VI .

		of the '' ^ neid '' has just appeared , apol - ogizes for adding another to the already numerous translations of Virgil -LRB- ''
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	'' he styles the poet -RRB- , and says : '' It has seemed to me that , if one could produce a version of the ' ^ Eneid ' that should be in itself an English poem , and at the same time a faithful reflection of the original , neither adding to the text nor diminishing from it , such an achieve - ment would be worth the time and labor required for the task . ''

		This is , indeed , the whole problem , and we are bound to say that Mr.
Rhoades	PERSON	has been one of the most successful of those who have en - deavored to solve it .

		We make a brief extract from the prophecy of the sixth book . ''

		Here is
Caesar	LOCATION	, here The whole line of lulus , that thall pass One day beneath the mighty pole of heaven .

		This , this the man so oft foretold to thee ,
Caesar Augustus	PERSON	, a god 's son , who shall The golden age rebuild through Latian fields Once ruled by
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	, and push far his sway O'er
Garamantians	PERSON	and the tribes of Ind , A land that lies beyond the stars , beyond The year 's path and the sun 's , where , prop of heaven ,
Atlas	PERSON	upon his shoulders turns the pole , Studded with burning constellations . ''

		This is excellent verse , and the elevation is fairly sustained throughout the translation .

		Of the new edition of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, which we must dismiss with a word , the principal things to be said are that it offers a critical edition of the text alto - gether superior to any previously in existence , a compact and fairly exhaustive body of notes , and an introductory biography that must at once super - sede all others , and remain for an indefinite period the standard authority for the life of the poet .

		It is difficult to accord to Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's labors the praise that they deserve ; no previous editor of
Cole	PERSON	- ridge has approached him either in knowledge or in painstaking industry .

		The memoir , we understand , is to be republished by itself , a compliment of which it is entirely worthy .

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	is a superbly Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	v i gorous am i trenchant writer .

		He as an apologist .

		, belongs with Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	to that younger school of English radicals who have discarded the rhetorical bravery of the poets and orators of the Revolution , have outgrown the nar - rowness and harshness of the original
Bentham	PERSON	- ite , have supplemented will by evolution and added culture and the historic sense to
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Their only fault is that they are at all times sweetly reasonable and on all topics hopelessly and irreme - diably right .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has but one weakness a fondness for parson-baiting , an itching for the - ological polemic , a desire to do over again the work of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		He knows better .

		He has read his
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and his Renan , and is aware that for this gross work '' Voltaire suffit '' But at times the unregenerate blood grows hot within him , he '' bites his thumb , '' he '' remembers his everlasting blow , '' and sallies forth to confound the orthodox with '' An Agnostic 's Apology , and Other Essays '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		`` Why , '' he passionately exclaims , '' when no honest man will deny in private that every ultimate problem is wrapped in the profound - est mystery , do honest men proclaim in pulpits that unhesitating certainty is the duty of the most fool - ish and ignorant '' ?

		Why , perhaps because , as
Emerson	PERSON	says , '' All the Muses and love and reli - gion hate these developments and will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory . ''

		And if this is so , what is the use of proving by irrefragable logic that the '' scepticism of believers '' is really more par - alyzing to progress than '' scepticism about the shift - ing phantasmagoria of theology . ''

		What profits it to combat '' the Higher Pantheism '' by a demon - stration that the dreams of theologians are not more than half true while they last , and that if we will live in dreams we lose our firm grasp of realities ?

		Of what avail solemnly to analyze and refute
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	's '' Theory of Belief '' ?

		Do any thinkers take seriously this `` theory of belief , '' or its author , except as a '' stylist '' and a '' grand old man '' ?

		And , when all is said , will Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's seventy pages of close reasoning convince anybody who is not already satisfied with
Arnold	PERSON	's quiet affirmation that ''
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	has accepted a solution which is , frankly speaking , impossible '' ?

		The del - icate irony of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's essay on '' The Reli - gion of All Sensible Men '' will delight the literary epicure .

		But will it induce one '' sensible man '' to come out if his interest bids him keep the peace ?

		Does it really bring us any nearer the solution of the painful questions of conscience started in Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's '' Compromise '' ?

		The discussion of the entire problem of persecution in the essay on '' Poi - sonous Opinions '' is an admirable philosophic sup - plement to Mill 's essay on '' Liberty . ''

		But will it make it possible for the Professor of Psychology to deliver his whole thought in any chair in the
United States	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	?

		But we are wrong .

		Supersti - tion and intolerance are always striving for the mastery of the world , and must be combated in many ways .

		The slow gentle solvents of Renan 's irony , of
Arnold	LOCATION	's freely-playing consciousness , and of Mr.
Paters	PERSON	's tolerant interest in all errors that assume picturesque forms , will not suffice .

		There will always be enough neutrals , lovers of peace and advocates of compromise and accomodation .

		And so , lest the conflict prove too unequal , the philosophic onlooker , accepting with a grimace the service of the vitriol of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and the bludgeon of Inger - soll , will gladly welcome the finely-tempered , keen , trenchant blade of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	.

		One would have to be a very crabbed and uncompromising Ibsenite not to smile at these delightful burlesques , which touch with inimitable skill the weak spots of the works which they parody , and give humorous exaggeration to the points that most clearly lend themselves to satirical treatment . ''

		Rosmersholm , '' A Doll Home , '' ''
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	, '' and The Wild Duck '' are thus presented in revised forms , while in '' Pill-doctor Herdal '' we have '' rather a rev - erent attempt to tread in the footprints of the Nor - wegian dramatist , than a version of any actually existing masterpiece . ''

		The author confesses that '' his imitation is painfully lacking in the magnifi - cently impenetrable obscurity of the original , that the vein of allegorical symbolism is thinner through - out than it should be , and that the characters are not nearly as mad as persons invariably are in real life , '' but even with these drawbacks , '' Pill-doctor Herdal '' offers no lack of mirthful entertainment .

		Yes ; I suppose there is a poultice of that sort burning on every breast and we must never take it off either it is our simple duty to keep it on .

		I , too ,
Haustus	LOCATION	, am haunted by a fancy that if this
Miss Wangel	PERSON	were to ring at our bell now '' At this juncture ,
Miss Wangel	PERSON	does ring at the bell , but what follows must be left to imagination , or found out by our readers for themselves .

		, .

		.

		, The endeavor of Mr.
Henry M. Statistics	PERSON	of crime ... J and poverty in Boies in '' Prisoners and Paupers the tfnited state * .

		-LRB- p utnam -RRB- is to state and emphasize the alarming increase in the
United States	LOCATION	of our criminal and dependent classes .

		The ordinary reader will be led by his pages to conclude that our nation is fast going to ruin .

		Statistics of crime and poverty are given , which , on their face , show that vice is growing with tremendous rapidity and that destitution will soon become general .

		The author discusses the problems of intemperance , im - migration , our urban population , the negro race , and jails and poor-houses , in a way to multiply our fears rather than to enlighten us respecting causes and remedies .

		These are indeed great problems , worthy serious attention and in need of wise action .

		But while Mr.
Boies	PERSON	is a gentleman of earnestness and experience , it is clear that he has no such skill in handling statistics as Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	, and no such scientific ability in studying social phe - nomena as Dr.
Amos G. Warner	PERSON	.

		In some cases , he does not seem to understand the figures which he uses , while in other cases he indulges in careless statements .

		He shows that since
1850	DATE	, criminals have increased three times as fast as our population .

		This is indeed what appears upon the face of re - turns .

		But it is evident that we are not three times as wicked a people as forty years ago !

		When we look at the statistics more carefully , we see that the comparison is vitiated by several factors : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The criminal acts of the negro race are ex - cluded from the census of
1850	DATE	, but included in that of
1890	DATE	, a fact of great importance .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The census of
1890	DATE	was more thorough than that of
1850	DATE	along this line ; it not only reports the facts more accurately but it reports new classes of facts .

		So that conclusions based upon a literal comparison must be manifestly erroneous .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- New laws and police regulations lead to arrests and convictions where acts would have been considered innocent forty years ago .

		Cruelty to animals and children caused few arrests then ; violations of san - itary regulations were unknown ; offences against public order , such as drunkenness and the selling of liquor ; all these and many other acts , like the pur - chase of lottery tickets , though innumerable , did not enter into our criminal records as at present .

		That our list of criminals has grown in this direction is evidence , not of our increasing depravity , but of our
Poland	LOCATION	in history .

		moral progress .

		We have more patients in hospi - tals than the Esquimo , but it does not follow that we are physically a more feeble people .

		Mr.
Boies	PERSON	does not make any such discriminations , he only alludes to the fact respecting the negro race .

		These defects vitiate all his discussions of these problems , which are indeed great and serious problems .

		His incapacity in this line is farther shown by his use of a statement from Professor
Ely	PERSON	to support his claim that there are three million paupers in the
United States	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 205 -RRB- , and by his astonishing as - sertion that there are 17,058 county jails in our country -LRB- p. 193 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Morfill	PERSON	, among Englishmen , seems to have a monopoly of pro- duct on Slavonic subjects , in the field of history as well as of literature .

		He now gives to the '' Story of the Nations '' series a ''
Poland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		No writer of English would seem bet - ter qualified for such a work , yet Mr.
Morfill	PERSON	has hardly added to what one may get from an ency - clopaedia on this subject .

		His book is sketchy , and one ends it by wishing for a guide through the maze of aimless energy which it portrays .

		What one needs is an explanation of
Poland	LOCATION	's failure in his - tory , which Mr.
Morfill	PERSON	does not give in his pages devoted to that purpose .

		An unpatriotic nobility , an intolerant clergy , a lacking middle class , and a degraded peasantry , were characteristics of all feudal states .

		That
Poland	LOCATION	did not change all this was not due solely to the fifth cause suggested the want of rulers of talent and energy , although a
Louis Eleventh	LOCATION	, a
Henry Eighth	ORGANIZATION	, or a Ferdinand the Catholic , would have been a great blessing to
Poland	LOCATION	.

		But all these men had their opportunity only be - cause the principle of hereditary succession was al - ready established in their dominions .

		The curse and the ruin of
Poland	LOCATION	was an elective monarchy , which , as in the case of the
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, made a feudal condition of anarchy possible long after the age of feudalism was gone by .

		The fail - ure of success of this volume is not due to a lack of knowledge , but to a lack of historical insight on the part of a man whose forte is linguistic .

		A readable and Many a guide for the amateur pho - fo ^ amaiew ^ tographer has appeared of recent photographers .

		years , written either in the interest of the general public , or in that of some firm en - gaged in the manufacture of photographic materials .

		It has been left for Miss Alice French -LRB- Octave Thanet -RRB- to produce a book upon the subject which serves its readers not only as guide , but also as philosopher and friend .

		Every beginner in this intricate art knows how deep is at times the need of philosophy , and how consoling may be the min - istry of friendship .

		Miss French has pursued pho - tography through trials to triumphs -LRB- as some of the pictures in her book clearly show -RRB- , but she has not acquired the air of superiority that makes the suc - cessful amateur so cordially detested by all less sue -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 cessful aspirants .

		A record of failure is often more helpful than a record of triumphant achievement , and Miss French , in her record , gives abundant evidence that she too is human , and no exception to the maxim , humanum errare est. .

		In vivacious and unconven - tional language , she tells the reader of her early tribulations , of the pitfalls upon which stumbled her unwary feet , and of the methods and formulae in which she finally found salvation .

		Miss French 's book is good , first , to read , and second , to keep at hand for practical guidance in all the stages of photo - graphic work .

		It is entitled '' An Adventure in Photography '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Appreciative chats on American artists .

		In a series of essays and sketches reprinted under the collective title , `` Picture and Text '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	chats appreciatively of the admirable group of artists Messrs.
Abbey	PERSON	,
Parsons	PERSON	,
Millet	LOCATION	, Bough ton ,
Reinhart	PERSON	,
Sargent	LOCATION	, etc. best known to many of us through the medium of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The excellence , in point of illustra - tion , of American magazines is justly a matter of national pride one of the shining exceptions to which we refer the carping foreigner ; and it is well to learn something of leading personality and methods of the illustrators .

		Touching the illustra - tion of books and magazines in general , the author observes that it '' may be said to have been born in our time , so far as variety and abundance are the signs of it ; or born , at any rate , the comprehensive , ingenious , sympathetic spirit in which we conceive and practise it .

		If the centuries are ever arraigned at some bar of justice to answer in regard to what they have given , of good or of bad , to humanity , our interesting age -LRB- which certainly is not open to the charge of having stood with its hands in its pockets -RRB- might perhaps do worse than put forth the plea of having contributed a fresh interest in ' black and white . ' ''

		The little book , which con - tains several illustrations , is a companion volume in the '' Black and White Series '' to Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's '' From the Easy Chair , '' Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's '' As We Were Saying , '' etc. .

		Of Mr.
James	PERSON	's quality as an essayist we need not speak .

		Even those who do not care for him must admit his painstaking fidel - ity to his models ; and , at the worst , he may serve to sharpen the reader 's appetite for a bit of down - right Anglo-Saxon .

		Interpretations of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's Mr.
Harold Littledale	PERSON	's '' Essays on
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	's Idylls of the King '' Idylls of the
King	LOCATION	.

		/ - MI \ v. j i -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are based upon lec - tures written for students in
India	LOCATION	.

		It was cer - tainly worth while to offer the book in its present form to English and American students .

		Like other books prepared for the use of Indian under - graduates , this volume explains many things that any good dictionary could explain , but on the other hand it interprets many phases of the Idylls that no reference-book alludes to .

		There are chapters on the sources of the Arthurian story , on its growth from
Malory	LOCATION	to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and on personages and localities spoken of in the modern epic .

		Then follow stud - ies of each Idyll , and annotations on particular words and obscure points .

		The work is by no means ex - haustive , but the material is carefully selected and well arranged .

		There is a constant comparison of
Tennyson	LOCATION	with
Malory	PERSON	and the
Mabinogion	PERSON	, and many interesting points of departure are suggested to the reader .

		The interpretation of the allegor - ical bearing of the Idylls is sensible and appreciat - ive , and the treatment of the rise of the legend , al - though brief , is in the main accurate .

		Rather strangely , however , Mr.
Littledale	PERSON	takes no account of such an authoritative work as Professor
Rhy	PERSON	's `` Arthurian Legend . ''

		The work can readily be used as a handbook in a
Tennyson	LOCATION	class .

		A sailing-voyage from
New York	LOCATION	to
Cape Town	LOCATION	. ''

		Undei > C ttOn Canva8 '' is a lively account , with much inci - i a. i < / < M - dental '' yarn-spinning , ot a sailing - voyage from
New York	LOCATION	to
Cape Town	LOCATION	, thence , over two hundred degrees of longitude , across the Indian and
Pacific Oceans	LOCATION	, to the coast of
Chili	LOCATION	, and from
Chili	LOCATION	to the
Falkland Islands	LOCATION	.

		The author , Cap - tain
J. H. Potter	PERSON	, of the ship '' Onward , '' observes in his Preface : '' While
Cooper	PERSON	,
Marryatt	PERSON	, and others , have let the world know all about sailing before the day of steam , I know of no writer having yet come to the front to give anywhere near the correct idea of how it is with us , the ' wind-jammers , ' since the introduction into our profession of that powerful element .

		This work was accordingly begun with the sole view of contributing towards the supply of that deficiency . ''

		A '' wind-jammer , '' it may be said parenthetically , is a sailing-vessel , as contra - distinguished from a steamer .

		The story is told , as it should be told , for the most part , in an off - hand , breezy , sailor-like fashion , with plenty of in - cident , humorous as well as stirring .

		But oddly enough there is a tendency here and there to '' work in , '' at all hazards , a tempting literary allusion or citation which results once or twice , where the connection is remote , in the Captain 's getting his syntactical sails '' all a-back and shaking , '' and nar - rowly escaping shipwreck .

		Mallet 's '' The French Revolution '' A good summary of the French -LRB- ocribner -RRB- , written by a lecturer on the staff of the
Oxford University Extension	ORGANIZATION	for the '' University Extension Manuals '' series , may be thoroughly commended .

		It is the best summary of the Revolution yet published , and is a large improvement on the sketch by
O'Connor Morris	PERSON	, also published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The author has availed himself of all the recent litera - ture of his subject down to Mr.
Morse Stephens	PERSON	, and has not only summarized but has unified these con - tributions .

		His first two chapters clearly introduce the Revolution through its social causes , and he is very successful in showing why the Constitutional party failed , why the Jacobin party followed , and why the latter also failed .

		He ends his narrative 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, rightly with the thunder of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	's guns from the portals of
St. Roch	ORGANIZATION	against the insurgent
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- tions .

		His estimate of La Fayette is a compromise between the conventional one and the iconoclastic portrayal of
Morse Stephens	PERSON	, and is probably near - est the truth .

		One may here trace briefly yet clearly the rapid sequence of causes and effects which
Stephens	PERSON	alone of the more detailed historians has been able to keep above the surface of the multi - tudinous events narrated .

		As a text-book guide to the subject it must be highly praised .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		VOLUME IV .

		-LRB- just published -RRB- of `` The Correspond - ence and Public Papers of
John Jay	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- covers the dates between
1794	DATE	and
1826	DATE	, thus completing the work that Professor
Henry P. Johnston	PERSON	has edited with so much care .

		The volume opens with a letter from
Jay to Dugald Stewart	PERSON	, '' returning thanks for the gift of his ingenious work , '' and closes with the action of the
New York	LOCATION	Bar upon the occasion of
Jay	PERSON	's death .

		There is also a very satisfactory index to the complete work .

		THE new edition of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's '' Handbook for Trav - ellers in
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- has been almost wholly rewritten by Mr.
Basil Hall Chamberlain	PERSON	-LRB- than whom there is no higher authority -RRB- , assisted by Mr.
W. B. Mason	PERSON	.

		A thorough revision of the sort here accomplished was peculiarly necessary in the case of the present work , for the world moves rapidly in
Japan	LOCATION	, as if to make up for many centuries lost , and even the past decade has transformed many sections of the country .

		Generally speaking , we prefer a ''
Bae	ORGANIZATION	- deker '' to a ''
Murray	PERSON	'' for a guide-book , but the '' Mur - ray '' now before us is one of the very best of that im - print , and no English tourist in
Japan	LOCATION	can afford to be without it .

		SOME '' Selections from the Writings of
William Blake	PERSON	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- have been made by Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	, who also supplies them with an introductory essay that is labored and not altogether agreeable in manner .

		The selections include both prose and poetry ; were it not for the prose extracts , its place would seem to have been filled by Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	's edition of the poems .

		Such a selection as this is all of
Blake	PERSON	that is wanted by the great major - ity of readers , although the recent sumptuous publica - tion of his entire works shows that there exists at least a limited demand for the more chaotic productions of his unregulated genius .

		MR.
Charles Frederick Holder	PERSON	's `` Louis Agassiz '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , appearing in the '' Leaders in Science '' series , gives a very readable popular biography of the great naturalist .

		The work is illustrated , and has a useful bibliography .

		Two recent issues in ''
Whittaker	PERSON	's Library of Popular Science '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are ''
Geol	PERSON	- ogy * '' by Mr.
A. J. Jukes-Brown	PERSON	, and '' Electricity and Magnetism , '' by Mr.
S. R. Bottone	PERSON	.

		These books are of the most elementary description , but subserve a use - ful purpose .

		Six articles that originally appeared in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' have been grouped in a volume entitled '' Homes in City and Country '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		They in - clude '' The
City House	ORGANIZATION	in the East and South , '' by Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	; `` The
City House	ORGANIZATION	in the West , '' by the late
John W. Root	PERSON	; articles on `` The Suburban House , '' '' The
Country House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Small Country Places '' ; closing somewhat incongruously with a chap - ter on '' Building and Loan Associations . ''

		The book is provided with many handsome illustrations , and the '' homes '' with which it deals are for the wealthy .

		THE fact that Mr.
H. F. Pelham	PERSON	's '' Outlines of Ro - man History '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is essentially a reprint of the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' article upon the subject stamps the work with the hall-mark of literary and schol - arly excellence .

		Many revisions and additions have , how - ever , been made to fit the article for reproduction as an in - dependent volume .

		The greater part of the work is given to the years 133
B. C. 69 A. D.	PERSON	, from the Grac - chi to the fall of Nero .

		A useful list of authorities prefaces the book .

		Two recent volumes of the '' Contemporary Science Series '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- are '' Modern Meteor - ology , '' a useful popular treatise by Mr.
Frank Waldo	PERSON	, and '' Public Health Problems , '' by Mr.
John F. J. Sykes	PERSON	.

		The latter work treats its subject from a distinctly prac - tical standpoint , and includes valuable chapters upon the precautionary measures to be adopted in case of ep - idemics .

		Similar in interest to the work last mentioned is Dr.
F. L. Dibble	PERSON	's '' Vagaries of Sanitary Science '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a work which exposes many popular errors and throws much light upon the workings of sanitary officialism , as illustrated by
State Boards of Health	ORGANIZATION	and the like .

J. M. Rice	PERSON	; `` An Embassy to
Provence	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	; '' The White Islander , '' by Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	; and a new volume of poems by Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	.

		`` Borderland , '' is the title selected by Mr.
W. T. Stead	PERSON	for his newest periodical venture .

		It is to be '' a quarterly review and index devoted to the study of the phenomena vulgarly called ' supernatural . ' ''

		Mr.
Stead	PERSON	, it may be mentioned , has lately become a medium him - self , and we may expect some astonishing tales from his forthcoming quarterly .

		In the
French Academy of Inscriptions M. Haureau	ORGANIZATION	recently announced the discovery of a new manuscript of
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	's poem addressed to his son .

		It contains 1,040 verses , of which only 461 were hitherto known .

		It contains some of the heretical views attributed to him , it mentions He * loise , and versifies a passage from one of her letters .

		M. Haureau will publish the poem .

		Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	has the following '' note '' in '' The Author '' for
July	DATE	: '' I earnestly hope that no at -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 tempt will be made at the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting to revive the project of perpetual copyright .

		In my opinion it would be pure waste of time .

		The abstract jurispru - dence of this question was thoroughly discussed in the great case of
Jefferys vs. Boosey	ORGANIZATION	in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, in
1854	DATE	, and there can be nothing new to say about it . '' ''


Pierre Loti	PERSON	'' has decided to devote himself to a new work , the plot of which will be laid in the Holy Land .

		To obtain materials for his '' coloring '' he will make a pilgrimage through Palestine , starting from
Cairo	LOCATION	as soon as the
summer	DATE	heat is over , and proceed across the desert to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		There will be no Europeans in his caravan .

		His idea is to follow as near as he can the route taken by the Holy Family in the flight into
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		We learn from the
London	LOCATION	'' Academy '' that Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	, who has been engaged for some years upon a Dictionary of the ''
Divina Comedia	PERSON	, '' has decided to divide the publication into two parts .

		The first , which will be complete for the whole of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's works , Latin as well as Italian , will contain the arti - cles dealing with the proper names .

		The second will comprise the Vocabulary proper .

		Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	hopes eventually to supplement the latter with the vocabulary of the '' Convito , '' ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, '' and '' Can - zoniere . ''

		Mr.
R. H. Sherard	PERSON	writes from
Paris	LOCATION	to '' The Au - thor '' of the breakfast given to
M. Zola	PERSON	in celebration of the completed Rougon-Macquart series .

		He says : '' There were about two hundred guests , and the dejeuner was held on one of the islands in the
Bois de Boulogne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Zola looked very spruce in a black frock coat , light grey trousers , and a pair of varnished boots .

		He called his publisher ' my old friend , ' and said , ' If I have not ceased writing you have not ceased publishing , '' so that , in sort , as much of the honor was due to the pub - lisher .

		It was a pleasant sight to see author and pub - lisher sitting side by side united by such bonds of affec - tion . ''

		The Independent Theatre of
London	LOCATION	offers the fol - lowing highly attractive programme for next season : ''
William Rufus	PERSON	, '' by
Michael Field	PERSON	, to be given without scenic accessories ; '' The Black Cat , '' a play in three acts , by Dr.
Todhunter	PERSON	; `` A Family Reunion , '' a play also in three acts , by Mr.
Frank Danby	PERSON	; `` Salve , '' a one-act play , by Mrs.
Oscar Beringer	PERSON	; `` The Death of Count Godfrey , '' by Messrs.
Walter Besant	PERSON	and
W. H. Pol	PERSON	- lock ; Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's translation of
Herr Ibsen	PERSON	's '' Wild Duck '' ; and `` The Heirs of Rabourdin , '' translated by Mr.
A. Teixeira	PERSON	de Mattos from
M. Zola	PERSON	. ''

		La
Prin	PERSON	- cesse Maleine '' of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	is to be given by ma - rionettes .

		Herr
Strindberg	LOCATION	's '' Father '' is being trans - lated by Mr.
J. H. McCarthy	PERSON	; and Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	will supply a new play .

		A passage put into the mouth of Horne-Tooke by Landor -LRB- in the first Conversation between
Johnson	PERSON	and Horne-Tooke -RRB- bears aptly upon the present discussion of the decadence of modern English .

		Indeed , the whole dialogue is wise and racy in comments on the tenden - cies of English . ''

		I wish I were as sure , '' says
Horne	PERSON	-
Tooke	PERSON	, '' that Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere , as I am that , ~ , Cadentque Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula .

		I am unacquainted with any language in which , during the prosperity of a people , the changes have run so sel - dom into improvement , so perpetually into impropriety .

		Within another generation , ours must have become so corrupt that writers , if they hope for life , will find it necessary to mount up nearer to its Sources . ''

		Mr.
C. A. Ward	PERSON	, writing to `` The Athenseum , '' tells of the recovery of a
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	manuscript by many thought to have no other than a mythical existence .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's letter is as follows : '' The name of
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	stands out so prominently in the col - umns of ` The Athenaeum ` of
June 17th	DATE	that if atten - tion be not solely to be restricted to the poetical suc - cesses of this myriad-minded man the greatest man of our century , towering over all else by a head and shoulders , as critic , thinker , bard what follows may have interest .

		There have drifted to me by accident -LRB- though at each step traceable historically -RRB- two vol - umes , quarto , of MSS. , bound , entitled respectively : ' The History of Logic ' and ' Elements of Logic . '

		In
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's letter to
Allsop	PERSON	the work is mentioned as complete and nearly ready for press .

		This assertion has been called an opium-dream .

		But here is the book .

		It is not very like modern philosophy ; but some care to hear two sides of a question .

		I write to ascertain whether the agnostic materialism is now so established that high spiritualism can no longer be allowed to breathe , and for such purpose nothing can test the point like ' The Athenseum . ' ''

		In 2 vols. , 8vo , cloth ,
$ 12.00	MONEY	.

		The career of the late Sir
Richard F. Burton	PERSON	, the distinguished traveler , and editor of `` The Arabian Nights , '' was perhaps the most adventurous and romantic of any Englishman of the last generation .

		He was an encyclopedic scholar , and much more than a scholar .

		He knew and had seen more of dark
Africa	LOCATION	than most men , and more of Mohammedan lands than any man .

		It seemed a simple thing for him to travel in disguise among fanatics where discovery meant death , but his life was manysided , and his biography illustrates a remarkable va - riety of interests .

		Lady
Burton	PERSON	has proved her literary ability before , and in these volumes she has done justice to an exceptional opportunity .

		74 A YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITER - ATURE .

		For some time past '' The Athenaeum '' has published annual summaries of the current lit - erature of
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, each country of importance being represented by a special ar - ticle .

		To the year just ended are devoted no less than thirty-two pages of the issue for
July 1	DATE	of our English contemporary , and the infor - mation given by this series of communications is of such interest that we feel justified in de - voting considerable space to a summary of their contents .

		There are in all thirteen articles , the countries represented being
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Bo	LOCATION	- hemia ,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		This list includes , it will be seen , every European country of any literary import - ance , with the two exceptions of
Norway	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	.

		M.
Joseph Reinach	PERSON	, who is the French con - tributor to this symposium , thus comments upon the general literary situation in
France	LOCATION	: '' The word crisis is , indeed , the most applicable to the present state of French letters .

		They are on a field of battle where two different mental tendencies are struggling for mastery : science and metaphysics , criti - cism and belief , realism and idealism .

		Fifty or sixty years ago the same phenomenon appeared , and then romanticism triumphed over classicism , positivism over spiritualism , liberal ideas over the old principles of abso - lutism .

		Which will triumph to-day can not be predicted with certainty .

		Perhaps neither of the tendencies which I have indicated will be victorious ; perhaps the two currents of existing thought will continue to run par - allel .

		At most one may discover under the vacillations of the moment an uneasiness in matters of social action , and in regard to letters in particular a growing belief that they are not merely a relaxation , an amusement , or a consolation , but that they ought to result in some direct teaching and help to man , tracing for him a line of conduct in life .

		This will be better understood after a rapid glance at the principal works of French litera - ture during the last twelve months . ''

		After a few comments upon the influence ex - erted over French thought by the two great men of letters who have recently died Renan and
Taine M. Reinach	PERSON	begins his review with some remarks about
M. Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	, whose ''
Jeunesse de Frederic II	PERSON	. ''

		is one of the notable books of the year . ''

		His talents as a sagacious historian and a fascinat - ing writer have often been remarked upon , but he is , perhaps , less known as an educationalist to those who are not familiar with the progress and history of school - mastering .

		M.
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	has in this department left a very deep impress on the generation of young professors and their youthful auditors of the
Faculty of Letters	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, where he teaches .

		After
1870	DATE	he held that it was the mission of the
Ministers of Public Education	ORGANIZATION	, and especially of the professors of history , to know and make known the secret of our conquer - or 's power .

		That is why all his endeavors have been concentrated on the annals of
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		His success has been so signal , both in the quality of the matter and the excellence of the manner of his work , that the author of ' Etudes sur les Origines de la
Prusse	PERSON	' is recognized to-day as an incontestable authority on the point . ''

		Studies of the French Revolution have figured 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, largely in the work of the past year , having been encouraged by the Society of the History of the Revolution , and by a special chair established by the
Faculty of Letters	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Some of the books in this department are
M. Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's '' Le Culte de la Raison et le Culte de 1 ` Etre Su - preme , 1793-1794 , '' the fourth volume of
M. Albert Sorel	PERSON	's `` L'Europe et la Revolution , '' and
M. H. Houssaye	PERSON	's ''
1815	DATE	. ''

		Other histor - ical studies are
M. Thureau-Dangin	ORGANIZATION	's work on the reign of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	,
M. Spuller	PERSON	's work on Lamennais ,
M. Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	's '' La Pa - paute , L'Eglise , et la Democratic , '' and
M. Benoist	PERSON	's '' L'Eglise et 1 ` Etat . ''

		In poetry ,
M. Jose Maria de Heredia	PERSON	's '' Les Trophees '' is singled out for special praise .

		In fiction , the place of first importance is given to
M. Zola	PERSON	's '' La Debacle , '' of which we read : '' When this work appeared its morality was the sub - ject of much discussion .

		Some of its critics took ex - ception to the mournful picture of the military disor - ganization , the despair and general hopelessness which marked the terrible downfall of the empire .

		Some , in - deed , went so far as to accuse
M. Zola	PERSON	of a serious lack of patriotism for having thus laid bare the story of our army 's sufferings and defeats .

		These criticisms do not seem to me to have much foundation .

		The catastrophe at Sedan , terrible as it was , had certain lessons to teach , and it is well that someone should have interpreted them .

		There is a patriotism , as sincere and as ardent as the other , which finds in a defeat something to be learned and pondered over for future guidance . ''

		Other noteworthy works of fiction are
M. Bour	PERSON	- get 's '' Terre Promise '' and ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, ''
M. Margueritte	PERSON	's '' Sur le Retour , ''
M. Prevost	PERSON	's `` L'Automne d'une Femme , '' M.
France	LOCATION	's `` R6 - tisserie de la Reine Pedauque , ''
M. Barres	PERSON	's ''
L'Ennemi des Lois	PERSON	, '' and
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	's `` Les Rois . ''

		In criticism are mentioned a volume of essays by
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	,
M. de Vogue	ORGANIZATION	's * ' Heures d'Histoire , '' and
M. Doumic	PERSON	's '' De Scribe a Ibsen . ''


M. Reinach	PERSON	concludes his article in the following hopeful strain : '' The ethic or , to use a less pretentious word , the moral character of literature is regaining importance .

		The most of our men of letters are writers with a thesis even those who seem to sacrifice the least to the de - sire of proving a truth ; and the most wayward allow themselves to be impressed by the serious problems of the moment .

		In poetry , too , symbolism efforts to ex - press what young theorists call ' the mystery of things ' is a sign of the general state of men 's minds .

		It is the same with the historian in the choice of subject , and with the character and part some assign to critics .

		< L'art pour Part , ' ` le de ` sinte ` ressement litte ` raire , ' are phrases that have had their day , as well as descriptions of gross realities .

		The object of our best writers ap - pears to be to teach men what one of them calls ' le de - voir present et 1 ` action morale . ' ''


Herr Robert Zimmermann	PERSON	, who writes the German article , says that the literature of his country at the present day has less to fear from a comparison with contemporary literatures than from a comparison with its former great - ness , with the '' time of its literary classicism and philosophical idealism , '' which is so ob - vious as hardly to be worth the saying .

		In dramatic literature , nothing published has been found worthy of the Grillparzer prize , which is awarded only to dramas of inherent worth and proved success upon the stage .

		We have mention , however , of
Herr Fulda	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Das Ver	PERSON	- lorene
Paradies	PERSON	'' and '' Die Sklavin , '' of
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's '' Hirmat , '' of
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's '' Die
Weber	PERSON	, '' of
Herr Wilbrandt	PERSON	's '' Der
Meister	PERSON	von
Palmyra	LOCATION	, '' and of
Herr Widmann	PERSON	's '' Jenseits von Gut und Bose . ''

		The latter title is also given to the latest philosophical work of
Herr Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a very fin de siecle book , as appears from the writer 's comment : '' The justifiable contention that the man who has ar - rived at complete moral control over himself no longer requires the leading-strings of duty and legal restraint goes too far when it is assumed that commands and precepts are only binding upon lower ' mankind , and that the ' higher , ' or so-called < upper , ' mankind is above the law and the opposite qualities of good and bad .

		The moral cynicism contained therein is veiled by the sem - blance of greatness that superiority to the law conjures up in the minds of na'ive readers and onlookers . ''

		Among novels ,
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's '' Merlin '' leads the list , followed by the '' Per Aspera '' of Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	, the '' Sonntagskind '' of
Herr Spiel	PERSON	- hagen , and the '' Glaubenslos '' of
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	.

		The
Goethe Gesellschaft	ORGANIZATION	has been active during the year , and has done something towards the rehabilitation of
Chris	PERSON	- tiane .

		There has been no end of Bismarck literature , mostly ephemeral .


Herr Nietzsche	PERSON	, besides the book already mentioned , has pub - lished the fourth volume of his principal work , '' Also Sprach Zarathustra . ''

		Having fallen a victim to the curse of insanity , the career of this brilliant writer is probably closed .

		Literature has been active in all three of the Scandinavian countries , and we much regret that
Norway	LOCATION	should be unrepresented in the '' Athenaeum '' symposium .


Herr Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, writing from
Denmark	LOCATION	, tells us : '' The public is tired of books crammed with discus - sion , so that they seem the works of so many journal - ists tired of a sterile realism , which has ended with giving us only photographs of life , disregarding the human soul 's everlasting thirst for something beyond or behind reality .

		There is a feeling that we have had enough of sexual abnormities and pathological phenom - ena enough of stories of sinful and merely sensual love , detailed with minute accuracy ... Some point to
Maeterlinck	PERSON	as the prophet to come , and comment
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 on his works , while they proceed to imitate him as fast as they can .

		Many still swear by
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, and especially by his last esoteric dramas .

		French sym - bolists also are finding imitators and eulogists among our youngest writers , and Baudelaire has been canon - ized by a few young poets who ' have read him . ' ''

		The writer makes particular mention of the in - terest aroused in
Denmark	LOCATION	by the Shelley cen - tenary , and of Dr.
A. Hansen	PERSON	's translation of '' Prometheus Unbound . ''

		A sumptuous mon - ograph on Thorvaldsen is among the note - worthy books of the year , but the name of the author is not given .

		A great cooperative work on the
Denmark	LOCATION	of to-day is also mentioned .

		A dictionary of Danish national biography is being edited by
Herr Hegel	PERSON	of the
Gylden	PERSON	- dalske firm of publishers .

		Other books of im - portance are Professor
P. Hansen	PERSON	's '' History of the Royal Danish Theatre , '' Dr.
Vedel	PERSON	's work upon
Dante	PERSON	, and his '' Kulturbaerere '' -LRB- `` Bearers of Culture '' -RRB- , the latter being studies of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, and others .


Herr Hugo Tigerschibld	PERSON	, who writes from
Sweden	LOCATION	, thus characterizes the most important book of the year : '' The most remarkable literary production of the year is certainly
Louis	LOCATION	de
Geer	PERSON	's '
Minnen	PERSON	' -LRB- ' Memoirs ' -RRB- .

		Animated by an infinite love of truth , the aged states - man has bequeathed to his country the picture of a no - ble and upright , clear , if not altogether deep , personal - ity , in whose life , both private and political , one can never detect any but the purest motives .

		At the same time he has imparted to us in these memoirs many im - portant and hitherto unknown documents relating to
Sweden	LOCATION	's most recent history , which no one knows bet - ter than he who has taken such an active part in it . ''

		The death of the Countess Leffler-Cajanello was the most serious loss of Swedish letters during the year ; a posthumous sketch of her friend , Professor
Sonja Kovalevski	PERSON	, is among the books of the year mentioned by the writer of this article .

		Another posthumous work of import - ance gives to the public the letters and me - moirs of the great chemist
Scheele	PERSON	, and proves , we are told , '' to demonstration the claims of
Scheele	ORGANIZATION	to be regarded as the discoverer of oxygen . ''

		The following extract from the Swed - ish article is of much interest : '' The difficulties which Swedish authors in the field of ` belles-lettres have to contend with , and which , so far as they result from the limited area of the language and the restriction of the book market to a very short period of the year , have already been touched upon in my pre - vious review , have led during the present year to a combination of authors into an
Authors ' Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narrow circle which an author in
Sweden	LOCATION	can reckon upon , in consequence of the limited area of the lan - guage in general , is made even narrower than it need be by several other circumstances .

		A torrent of trans - lations from foreign belles-lettres of very doubtful value , not uufrequently acquired by publishers at unreasona - bly low prices , really floods the market , and competes with the works of original native authors .

		The Union has , therefore , set before it the task of ostracizing both bad translations and translations of bad books , and thereby establishing fixed minimum prices for both translations and original works . ''

		The article on
Italy	LOCATION	is the work of
Signori Ruggero Bonghi	PERSON	and
Giovanni Zannoni	PERSON	, and the following extracts are taken from the open - ing paragraphs : '' It is scarcely fifteen years since the domination of current Italian literature by one or the other of two schools of poetic thought if , indeed , they deserve the name seemed inevitable , and that two possible ways only were open to it , one of which it must follow .

		The tendency of the one school was to revert to classical models , more particularly
Horace	PERSON	, both in subject-mat - ter and in form ; the other followed in the steps of the latest examples of the French naturalistic school , bor - rowing all its worst features and all its exaggerations . ''

		Of the men of the first school we read : '' But their existence was short .

		The very audacity of their aims , and the sickly wantonness of many of them , not only wearied the reading public , but soon roused its indignation .

		To-day the majority of these poets have no alternative but to be ashamed of their own verses . ''

		The work of the other school is thus summar - ized : '' The classical school , on the other hand , had a no - bler object and a wider scope .


Giosue Carducci	PERSON	set forth its guiding principles in a volume which contains some of his best lyrics .

		He showed by his work how the art of Horace could best be reproduced in Italian lyric poetry , how best to render to Italian ears the music of hexameters and pentameters , alcaics and as - clepiads .

		To-day this neo-classic school seems also to be on the brink of dissolution , although it can still boast one or two good writers . ''


Signer Carducci	PERSON	, of course , remains the one great poet of contemporary
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		On the
20th of September	DATE	, the anniversary of the breach of the
Porta Pia	ORGANIZATION	, it has now been for some years
Carducci	PERSON	's custom to publish an ode on some national topic , inspired by the glory of our political resurrection .

		The title of this year 's poem is ' II Cadore . '

		Cadore pos - sesses some of the most stirring memories in the north of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Here it was that a long and fierce struggle took place against the Austrian troops .

		Cadore sent forth the best of her sons , her women , and her priests to fight for liberty so long as they had a drop of blood to shed .

		It was a truly heroic defense , worthy of being sung in epic and lyric strains , and
Carducci	PERSON	has cele - brated it in lofty patriotic verse . ''

		After mentioning the ''
Odi Navali	ORGANIZATION	'' of
Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	and the ''
Carmi e Odi Barbare	PERSON	'' of
Signor Razetti	PERSON	, the article continues as fol - lows : '' The following tendencies are , therefore , to be noted in regard to the development of poetry in
Italy	LOCATION	at pres - ent ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the repudiation of the neo-classic style , even 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, by those who have themselves closely followed it in the past , and the rise of a lyric poetry whose aim is to be the exponent of the miseries of the wretched .

		Hence academic poetry with its fixed poetic systems is falling into disuse , and it is not possible to save it .

		Upon its ruins is rising a new type of lyric poetry , devoting itself to otiose meanderings .

		The first fact need occa - sion nothing but rejoicing ; the second should warn us to advance somewhat circumspectly .

		Since a young poetess ,
Ada Negri	PERSON	, with the true poetic instinct , strong and original , has carried a generous wrath into glowing verses , too many have thought themselves to be inspired by the social muse ; but its notes are harsh and sombre .

		No longer do we see the old-fashioned
Arcadia	LOCATION	with its piping shepherds , but another type of
Arcadia	LOCATION	per - haps a less pleasing one with its oppressed and its barricades . ''

		Among novels we are especially asked to note Signer Praga 's '' La Biondina , '' Signer de Ros - si 's '' Mai d'Amore , ''
Signer Farina	PERSON	's '' Amore Bugiarda , ''
Signer Mambrini	PERSON	's '' A Bordo , '' and
Signora Serao	PERSON	's '' Castigo . ''

		In miscella - neous literature ,
Signora Beri	PERSON	's '' In
Calabria	LOCATION	, ''
Senatore Pasolini	PERSON	's ''
Caterina Sforza	PERSON	, ''
Signer Centelli	PERSON	's ''
Caterina Cornaro	PERSON	e il Sue Regno , '' and
Signer Carducci	PERSON	's '' La Storia del Giorno di
Giuseppe Parini	PERSON	, '' seem to be particularly noteworthy .

		Senor Riano leads off his discussion of con - temporary Spanish letters with some remarks upon the books called forth by the
Columbus	LOCATION	centenary .

		Among these we note ''
Autografos de Cristobal Colon y Papeles de America	ORGANIZATION	, '' a volume of original documents published by the
Duchess of Berwick	ORGANIZATION	and
Alba	PERSON	, and
Senor Asensio	PERSON	's ''
Fuentes Historicas Sobre Colon	PERSON	y
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The writer thus concludes the Co - lumbus section of his article : `` To end with this topic , which is becoming rather tedious , I may conclude by saying that two important points have been gained : one is that it is almost certain that
Columbus	LOCATION	's birthplace was
Savona	LOCATION	; the other that
Amerigo Vespucci	PERSON	never thought of giving , or pretended to give , his own name to the new continent discovered by
Columbus	LOCATION	, but that it was entirely the fault of those who drew the first charts of the discovered continent . ''

		We are also told of the
Congress of Ameri	ORGANIZATION	- canists assembled last
October	DATE	at
Huelva	LOCATION	, and of the linguistic studies stimulated by that gathering .

		There has been of late a consider - able revival in
Spain	LOCATION	of interest in Arabic studies , as the following paragraph will show : '' For some time past my countrymen seem to have arrived at the conviction that the study of the Oriental languages , and principally of the Magrebi or Western Arabic , is not only indispensable for the complete knowl - edge of the national annals , but also useful in view of
Spain	LOCATION	's mercantile and political relations with
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		Hence it is that the number of chairs or professorships at the universities has been increased ; that manuscripts have been bought at
Tunis	LOCATION	,
Algiers	LOCATION	, and elsewhere ; and that numerous publications are daily being made on the history and geography of
Mohammedan Spain	LOCATION	.

		I scarcely need call your readers ' attention to the collec - tion of Hispano-Arab historians which the learned Pro- fessor of Arabic at
the University of Madrid	ORGANIZATION	is now continuing , and the eighth volume of which , containing the text of
Ebu Alfaradhf	ORGANIZATION	, a writer of the fourteenth cen - tury of our era , has just appeared .

		Under the title of ' Estudios sobre la Invasion de los Arabes en
Espana	LOCATION	, '
Saavedra	PERSON	-LRB-
Don Eduardo	PERSON	-RRB- has published what may be rightly denominated a luminous essay on the invasion of
Spain	LOCATION	by the Moors . ''

		In belles-lettres , nothing of special importance has appeared during the year , unless we ac - cord that distinction to '' Mariana '' and '' Do - lores , '' two comedies by
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	.

		M.
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	's Belgian article opens as follows : `` The two principal events in the annals of French literature in
Belgium	LOCATION	during the last twelve months are the republication of the ' Le ` gende d'Uylenspiegel ' of the late
Charles de Coster	PERSON	, and the production at
Paris	LOCATION	of the ' Pelldas et Mdlisaude ' of
M. Maurice Maeter	PERSON	- linck . ''

		Other works deemed worthy of special mention are
M. Nautet	ORGANIZATION	's '' Histoire des Lettres Beiges d'Expression Francaise , ''
M. Eekhoud	PERSON	's '' Au Siecle de Shakespeare , ''
M. Kurth	PERSON	's '' L'His - toire Poetique des Merovingiens , '' the conclu - sion of '' L'CEuvre de
P. P. Rubens	PERSON	, '' by
M. Rooses	PERSON	, and the conclusion of the '' Cours d'Histoire Nationale , '' by Mgr .

		Nameche .

		Of the latter work we read : '' The twenty-ninth and last volume of Mgr .

		Nameche 's great '
Cours d'Histoire Nationale	ORGANIZATION	' has just made its ap - pearance , although the author died , at the age of eighty - two , in
January	DATE	last .

		This volume stops at the year
1804	DATE	, and deals with the history of
Belgium	LOCATION	under the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume of this vast and scholarly composition was published forty years ago . ''

		Among books written in the Flemish language , the writer gives the place of first importance to M. van Zuylen 's '' De
Belgische Taalwetten Toegelicht	PERSON	, '' a work '' designed to furnish an account of the laws on the official use of the two national languages . ''

		The death of La - veleye has been the great loss of the year in Belgian letters .

		From
Holland	LOCATION	, Mr.
Taco H.	PERSON	de Beer writes to inform us that '' there is a dreadful monot - ony about the middle-class Dutchman and about the ordinary society of the Dutch East Indies , which form the staple materials of our novel - ists . ''

		The successes in Dutch fiction have been ''
Eene Illusie	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Couperus	PERSON	, ''
Johannes Viator	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
van Eeden	PERSON	, and '' De
Bre	ORGANIZATION	- deros , '' a historical novel by Professor Jan ten Brink .

		Among plays , '' Petrus Dathenus , '' by Mr.
Hoogewerf	PERSON	, and ''
Het Goudvischje	PERSON	, ''
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 by Mr.
van Nouhuys	PERSON	, are noted .

		The follow - ing note is of curious philological interest : '' What might interest English readers is the appear - ance of a little book of Professor Bulbring , the well - known philologist from
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, who lately was made Professor of English at
Groningen	LOCATION	.

		The oratio inau - guralis of the Professor of English at a Dutch univer - sity was delivered in German !

		The professor 's pre - decessor was never heard speaking English in public , nor will the present professor address his audience in that language .

		As Professor Bulbring discoursed about ' Wege und Ziele der
Englischen Philologie	PERSON	, ' it is rather curious that he did not prove by example that speaking the language is one of the aims of English philology . ''

		Contemporary Russian literature is treated at some length by Mr.
P. Milyoukov	PERSON	, who does not , however , find many important works to mention .

		What he says of the literary tenden - cies of the last decades is highly interesting . ''

		The ' men of the eighties , ' who made a virtue of their want of principle , have been silent .

		It is not so long ago that they were making a stir and causing people to talk of them , although by no means formidable ; but latterly , although certain publicists belonging to the party still continue to pour out the vials of their wrath , nobody pays them any attention .

		Again , during the 1 seventies ' a curious movement sprang up which was called ' going among the people , ' and consisted in an adoption of the life of farm labourers by educated and cultivated young men , who thus established colonies amongst the peasantry which served as centres for the spread of socialism .

		During the ' eighties ' these set - tlements succumbed to the prevalent tone , and , cutting themselves off from their surroundings , devoted them - selves , partly under the influence of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's teach - ings , to the work of self-perfection .

		To-day they have taken a new departure .

		They have recognized that this self-centred work of internal improvement leads in - evitably to mysticism and sectarianism , and deprives them of all wider influence .

		In a word , the rise in the social temperature , which I recorded last year , continues unmistakably .

		The Russian social movement is clearly preparing itself for fresh and increasing efforts .

		To begin with , after putting aside the programme of the 1 men of the eighties , ' we have commenced an active survey of the social programmes of preceding periods .

		This is , indeed , the meaning of a renewal of the contro - versy between our liberals and our radicals , or party of the people ; for in a country where eighty-eight per cent of the population are peasants , radicalism is bound to be popular . ''

		A few of the publications mentioned by Mr.
Milyoukov	PERSON	are the '' Village Communes '' of Vorontzov , an '' Essay in Russian Historiog - raphy , '' by Professor
Ikonnikov	PERSON	, and a volume of '' Sketches and Tales , '' by
Korolenko	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	, who writes of things Polish , calls our attention to '' Lux in Tenebris Lucet , '' and '' Do We Follow Him , '' both by Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, and both showing signs of an encroaching mysticism which we hope will not make of this great writer a second
Tolstoi	PERSON	. ''

		Charcyzy , '' a historical novel by Mr.
Rawita	PERSON	, and '' The Annals of the Western Slavs , '' by Mr.
Bogulawski	PERSON	, are other noticeable books of the year .

		Mr.
V. Tille	PERSON	, the Bohemian corres - pondent , reports much Comenius literature , two volumes of poems and one of essays by Mr.
Vrchlicky	PERSON	, the first part of Mr.
Vlcek	PERSON	's '' History of Bohemian Literature , '' and a gen - eral tendency towards realism .


Herr Leopold Katcher	PERSON	, writing from
Hungary	LOCATION	, praises '' The Gyurkovics Girls , '' by Mr.
Ferencz Herczeg	PERSON	, the True Stories '' of Dr.
Adolf Agai	PERSON	, Mr.
Gracza	PERSON	's '' Life and Work of Kossuth , '' and the '' Social Economy '' of Professor
Foldes	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	, also , has published a novel , `` Brother George , '' in five volumes .

		This popular writer is soon to celebrate '' the half-centenary of his literary activity '' or rather it will be cele - brated for him by the publication of his col - lected works in a limited edition de luxe .

		Last of all upon our list comes an article from
Greece	LOCATION	, by Mr.
S. P. Lambros	PERSON	, who tells us of Mr.
Karkavitsas	PERSON	, and his tales , called `` Diegemata '' ; of '' The Eyes of My Soul , '' by Mr.
Palamas	PERSON	, and '' The Singer of the Village and the Fold , '' by Mr.
Krystallis	PERSON	, both volumes being verse .

		With these notes we must bring to an end our digest of this very valuable series of articles , referring our readers to the pages of '' The Athenaeum '' both for other titles and for further details concerning the books that we have sin - gled out for mention .

		THE A UXILIAR Y CONGRESSES .

		The space at our disposal in the last issue of THE DIAL was so fully taken up with the account of the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	that we were obliged to post - pone our report of the four other Congresses held during the week ending
July 15	DATE	.

		The subjects of those Congresses were , as our readers have already been informed , Philology , Folk-lore , History , and Libraries .

		THE CONGRESS OF PHILOLOGISTS .

		The
Congress of Philologists	ORGANIZATION	embraced the regu - lar annual meeting of the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	, specially appointed meetings of the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	, a meeting of the
Spelling Reform Association	ORGANIZATION	, and a number of general meet - ings for the consideration of papers not presented by the organized bodies of philologists above men - tioned .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	assembled , as a whole , what was probably the most important gathering of phil - ologists that ever met in the
United States	LOCATION	; and there is likely to follow , as one of its consequences , a series of biennial joint meetings of the philological societies of the country .

		The
American Philolog	ORGANIZATION	- ical Association usually devotes the first evening 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, session of its annual meeting to an address , upon some subject of extra-philological interest , by the President for the year .

		Professor
William Gard	PERSON	- ner
Hale	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has occu - pied that position for the year just ended , and his address was given
Tuesday	DATE
evening	TIME	,
July 11	DATE	, the subject being '' Democracy and Education . ''

		It was a scholarly exposition of the particular perils to which the higher education is exposed in a demo - cratic environment , and , in the case of our own country , opened a fairly hopeful outlook upon the future .

		Among the papers read before the Asso - ciation at its subsequent sessions we may mention the following as of special value : '' The Language of the Law , '' by Mr.
H. L. Baker	PERSON	; Vedic Studies , '' by Professor
Maurice Bloomfield	PERSON	; and '' The Re - mote Deliberative in Greek , '' by Professor
W. G. Hale	PERSON	.

		On
Wednesday	DATE	and
Friday	DATE
mornings	TIME	, there were held two '' general sessions , '' devoted mainly to the papers offered by distinguished European guests of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		These papers included '' The Connection between Indian and Greek Phi - losophy , '' by Professor
Richard Garbe	PERSON	, of
Konigs	LOCATION	- berg ; '' Helles and Dunkles I im Lateinischen , '' by Professor
Hermann Osthoff	PERSON	, of
Heidelberg	LOCATION	; '' Indogermanische Ablautprobleme , '' by Professor
Wilhelm Streitberg	PERSON	, of Freiburg -LRB-
Switzerland	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and '' The Scientific Emendation of Classical Texts , '' by Professor
E. A. Sonnenschein	PERSON	, of
Birmingham	LOCATION	.

		Other papers read at these sessions were : '' Some Problems in Greek Syntax , '' by Professor
Basil L. Gildersleeve	PERSON	; '' The Relation of Philology to His - tory , '' by Professor
M. Bloomfield	PERSON	; and '' The Eth - ical and Psychological Implications of the Style of Thucydides , '' by Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	.

		A paper on `` Unpublished Manuscript Treasures , '' by Mr.
T. G. Pinches	PERSON	, of the British Museum , was pre - sented at one of the sessions .

		Mr.
Pinches	PERSON	had made his preparations to be present at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but was , at the last moment , detained in
London	LOCATION	by a vexatious lawsuit .

		A paper sent by Professor
Michel Bre'al	PERSON	, of the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	, had for its subject `` Canons of Etymological Investigation , '' and was made the basis of an interesting discus - sion , opened by Professor
B. I. Wheeler	PERSON	.

		Another discussion , led by Professor
M. Bloomfield	PERSON	, had for its theme the `` Importance of Uniformity in the Transliteration of non-Roman Alphabets . ''

		The Association , before adjourning , transacted its regu - lar business , and elected Professor
James M. Gar	PERSON	- nett , of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, as President for the coming year .

		The meeting of the
Modern Language Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion comprised two sessions , both on
Thursday	DATE	,
July 13	DATE	.

		Among the papers presented were : '' The Language of the Sciences and a Universal Lan - guage , '' by Professor
F. A. March	PERSON	; '' German Phi - lology in
America	LOCATION	, '' by Professor M. D. Learned ; and '' The Training of
College and University	ORGANIZATION	Pro- fessors , '' by Professor
A. Rambeau	PERSON	.

		The Ameri - can
Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	and the Spelling Reform Asso - ciation had one session each .

		The sessions not held under the special auspices of the philological organizations were seven in num - ber , and offered a preponderance of papers upon subjects in the department of oriental archaeology .

		These papers were collected by Mrs.
Elizabeth A. Reed	PERSON	, and to this lady is due a special word of praise for her efforts in behalf of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Max Ohnefalsch-Richter	PERSON	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, lectured upon Cypriote archaeology ; and Professor
W. H. Goodyear	PERSON	, of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, summarized the line of argument , based upon a study of prehistoric orna - ment , that has made him a firm believer in the non-Asiatic origin of the Aryans .

		Both these lec - tures were illustrated with the lantern .

		Other speak - ers and papers comprised in the programmes of these miscellaneous sessions were : '' Old Testament History in the Light of Recent Discoveries , '' by Dr.
William C. Winslow	PERSON	, who represents the
Egypt	LOCATION	Exploration Fund in this country ; and '' Cleopatra , '' a lecture by Dr.
Samuel A. Binion	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The following papers -LRB- the writers not being pre - sent -RRB- were among those sent to be read at the Con - gress : '' Greek Ceramography in Relation to Greek Mythology , '' by Miss
Jane Harrison	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	; ''
Schliemann	PERSON	's Excavations , '' by Mrs.
Schliemann	PERSON	, of
Athens	LOCATION	; '' Assyrian and Babylonian Libraries , '' by Professor
A. H. Sayce	PERSON	, of Oxford ; '' Babylonian and Assyrian Archaeology , '' by Mr.
Hormuzd Ras	PERSON	- sam , of
London	LOCATION	; and '' Koptic Art and Its Relation to
Early Christian Ornament	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
Georg Ebers	PERSON	, of
Munich	LOCATION	.

		THE CONGRESS OF HISTORIANS .

		The
Congress of Historians	ORGANIZATION	was called to order by Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, on
Tuesday	DATE
morning	TIME	,
July 11	DATE	, and was organized by the choice of Dr.
James B. Angell	PERSON	, of
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	, as President , and Dr.
Herbert B. Adams	PERSON	, of
Johns Hopkins Univer	PERSON	- sity , as Secretary .

		These gentlemen hold the same positions in the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, and nearly all the contributors of papers are mem - bers of the same Association .

		The sessions were continued morning and evening for three days , the afternoons being devoted to the Fair at
Jackson Park	LOCATION	.

		Notwithstanding the fact that five Con - gresses were in progress at the same time and un - der the same roof , the history sessions were at - tended by several hundred interested auditors , and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was regarded by all as a complete suc - cess .

		Universities and colleges were largely repre - sented in the scheme of exercises .

		Of the contri - butors of the thirty-three papers , three were presi - dents of universities and seventeen were professors , most of them professors of history .

		Of the other contributors , ten were well-known historical writers , and four were ladies , whose papers were among the most interesting read .

		It will be seen that ama - teur historians and sensational theorists had no place in the programme .

		President
Angell	PERSON	was the reader of the first paper , his subject being '' The Inadequate Recognition of Diplomatists by His - torians . ''

		It was listened to with great interest ,
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 and set forth the eminent services of diplomatists , whose names , in connection with these services , are rarely mentioned by English and American histor - ians .

		French and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	writers have a better appreciation of historical justice .

		The discussion of '' The Value of National Historical Archives , '' by Mrs.
Ellen Hardin Walworth	PERSON	, of
Saratoga	LOCATION	, was one of the ablest and most practical papers read at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It depicted in eloquent and forcible terms the need of such a department at Washing - ton .

		All the other great , and many of the smaller , nations of the world have departments of archives , and the
United States	LOCATION	has none .

		The student of American history must go , or send , to
Europe	LOCATION	, or to
Canada	LOCATION	-LRB- which has an excellent department of state papers -RRB- , to find documents which should be in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Walworth	PERSON	concluded by offer - ing a resolution to the effect that a committee be appointed to memorialize our national
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to establish such a department .

		An earnest discussion followed , supporting the resolution , and it passed unanimously .

		Dr.
James Schouler	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Charles J. Little	PERSON	, of the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, happily discussed '' The Methods of Historical Investiga - tion '' and '' The Historical Method of Writing the History of Christian Doctrine . ''

		Dr.
Fred	PERSON	.

		Ban - croft read a paper on `` Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's Position to - ward the South from
November , 1860	DATE	, to
March 4 , 1861	DATE	. ''

		On
Wednesday	DATE
morning	TIME	, '' Pre-Columbian Discovery , '' `` Prince
Henry	PERSON	, the Navigator , '' and '' The Economic Conditions of
Spain	LOCATION	in the Sixteenth Century '' were ably treated by the Hon.
J. P. Bax	PERSON	- ter , of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Me.	LOCATION	, Prof.
E. G. Bourne	PERSON	, of Adel - bert College , and Prof.
Bernard Moses	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
California	LOCATION	; and Prof.
Lucy M. Salmon	PERSON	, of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, read a good paper on '' The Union of Utrecht . ''

		In the evening the Hon.
William Henry Smith	PERSON	, of Lake Forest , and Mr.
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	, of
Madison	LOCATION	,
Wis.	LOCATION	, read interesting papers on '' Early Slavery in the Northwest '' and '' Early Lead Min - ing in
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	. ''


Thursday	DATE	morning opened with a scholarly paper by Dr.
L. H. Boutell	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, on ''
Roger Sherman	PERSON	in the
National Constitutional Convention	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which he replied to the claim made by Dr.
Charles J. Stille	PERSON	'' , in his life of
John Dickinson	PERSON	, that
Dickinson	PERSON	was the author of the provisions of the Constitution con - cerning the number and choice of Senators .

		Other excellent papers were read , which we have not space to mention .

		The time , during the six sessions of more than two hours each , was fully occupied , and it was necessary to omit the reading of papers when their writers were not present .

		THE FOLK-LORE CONGRESS .

		It is quite impossible to summarize , in any de - tailed way , within the limits of the space available , the results of a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that cost months of active preparation and extended through six busy days .

		Only the barest outlines can be presented .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was planned and held in the face of op - position and discouragement from organized bodies in
London	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	's Secretary declaring that it would be im - practicable to hold a World 's
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	at this time .

		In view of the phenomenal suc - cess of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, these elements of difficulty and discouragement should be noted ; as should the fact that the success is very largely due to the un - tiring labors and enthusiasm of Lieut.
F. S. Bassett	PERSON	, chairman of the committee of arrangements .

		This was the third
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Folk-lore ever held , and really the first to which all nations were invited , and in which representatives from nearly all civilized peoples of the earth participated .

		More than thirty nationalities were represented , one hundred persons actively participating in the literary exercises , and more than a hundred in the concert .

		Twelve sessions were held , at which sixty-eight pa - pers and addresses were read and forty-seven sep - arate songs were sung , in addition to the phono - graphic chants .

		The geographical range of the essays was unrestricted .

		The folk-lore of all lands was treated at the hands of those who were natives , or who had lived in the lands of which they spoke , from
Corea	LOCATION	to
Dalmatia	LOCATION	.

		Many distinguished folk - lore scholars from abroad assisted personally in this exposition of the folk-lore of
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , and the two Americas .

		Among these were the Hon.
John Abercromby	PERSON	, Vice President of the English Folk-lore Society ; Mr.
Michel Smigrodzki	PERSON	, of
Poland	LOCATION	, a member of the
Paris	LOCATION	Socie ` te ' des Tra - ditions Populaires ; Mr.
Vucasovic	PERSON	, of
Dalmatia	LOCATION	; Mr.
Mihic	PERSON	, of
Servia	LOCATION	; Mr.
Beers	PERSON	, Secretary of the
New Orleans	LOCATION	Society ; the Hon.
Lorin Thurston	PERSON	, of
Honolulu	LOCATION	; Dr.
V. I. Shopoff	PERSON	, of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	; Mr.
Paul Groussac	PERSON	, of
Buenos Ayres	ORGANIZATION	; and Mr.
Ludwig Krwyzinski	PERSON	, of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		The scientific range of the papers read was also remarkable .

		No branch of folk-lore was unrepre - sented .

		Myths , legends , customs , superstitions , re - ligions , songs , in fact , all branches of folk-speech , folk-wont , and folk-thought , were dealt with .

		Par - ticularly were the legends and customs of the Amer - ican aborigines treated at the hands of such experts as Surgeon
Matthews	PERSON	, Lieutenant
Scott	PERSON	, Dr. East - man , Mr.
James Deans	PERSON	, Mr.
Quelch	PERSON	, Lieutenant Welles , and Mr.
Groussac	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Matthews	PERSON	's wonder - ful collection of phonographed Navajo songs , and Lieutenant
Scott	PERSON	's exposition of the sign language , were especially meritorious .

		Nor was the black man neglected .

		He carried off the honors at the con - cert , and in the hands of
Miss Owen	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Watson	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Sheldon	PERSON	, his superstitions and customs and his strange literature were ably represented .

		Many of these essays were made more popular by the objects from strange lands used in illustrating them , as , for example , Dr.
Matthews	PERSON	's '' Navajo Rites , '' Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's Hopi pigments , Mrs. French -
Sheldon	PERSON	's African charms , Mr.
Smigrodzki	PERSON	's tablet of the Svastika , and Mr.
Quelch	PERSON	's South American musical instruments .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, The bibliography of folk-lore has never received the attention here given to it .


Signor Pitre	PERSON	* for
Italy	LOCATION	,
M. Sdbillot	PERSON	for
France	LOCATION	and Creole literature ,
Seiior Rodriguez	PERSON	for
Venezuela	LOCATION	, and the Rev.
J. C. O'Hanlon	PERSON	for
Ireland	LOCATION	, fully presented the folk-lore bibliography of those lands .

		What may be called literary folk-lore received excellent treatment in Dr.
Prato	PERSON	's exhaustive article on `` The Symbolism of the Vase , '' Mr.
Field	PERSON	's charming poem , Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's Loup-garou story , Professor
Drago	PERSON	- monov and Mr.
Head	PERSON	's '' Taming of the Shrew , '' Dr.
Carsten	PERSON	's analysis of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Golden Legend , '' and the Hon.
John Abercromby	PERSON	's magic Finnish poetry .

		But it was in folk-song particularly that this Con - gress excelled .

		Besides the full collection of Na - vajo songs made by Dr.
Matthews	PERSON	, and the really beautiful folk-songs of Mr.
Smigrodzki	PERSON	, Mr.
Mihic	PERSON	, and Mr.
Cable	PERSON	, a concert consisting of more than forty solos and choruses , and embracing folk-music from
Japan	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, Swe - den ,
Norway	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Wales	LOCATION	, and North and
South America	LOCATION	, was rendered by natives of those lands in the costumes and languages of the countries , and accompanied frequently by their own strange instruments .

		This concert , made possible only by the presence of specially-organized World 's Fair choruses , and by the courtesy of various for - eign commissioners , was given free to the public in the two great halls of the Art Institute , to more than six thousand people , the numbers given in one hall being repeated to the audience in the other immediately after their performance in the first .

		Mr.
Frederick W. Root	PERSON	, who arranged the concert , de - serves the greatest credit for successfully accom - plishing this task , without a rehearsal , and with no precedent to guide him .

		In the Folk-lore
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as in others , women played a very important part .

		Very much of the success of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was due to the admirable tact , perseverance and effort of the acting chair - man of the Woman 's
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, Mrs.
S. F. Bassett	PERSON	.

		Eight essays were contributed by women , and much of the success of the concert was due to them .

		THE CONGRESS OF LIBRARIANS .

		The annual meeting of the American Library As - sociation , which is always an occasion of very great interest to all persons engaged in library work , was merged , this year , into the
Congress of Librarians	ORGANIZATION	, the papers read and subjects discussed taking , in consequence , a somewhat wider range than is usual at the meetings of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` PERHAPS AN ERROR . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In THE DIAL for
July 1	DATE	, I examined very briefly certain uses of known to and unknown to .

		The exam - ination was ancillary to the more important inquiry , Has '' F. H. '' ever erred ?

		Following the same line of research , I now submit , with illustrative quotations , a word or two about but ; premising , as in my former let - ter , that '' F. H. '' has identified himself in the public press as the author of '' Modern English . ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, or ''
F. H.	PERSON	, '' commenting adversely on Lan - dor 's praise of Gray 's English , says : '' But is Gray 's English , from the ordinary point of view , altogether faultless ?

		Look at ... his preterites begun , run , and throwed ; and his past participles broke , chose , and wrote .

		Add his ... ' none but they ' ; ' nobody but / ' ; ' I have seen nothing , neither ' ; ' nor drink out of nothing but ' ; ' every - body ... them . '

		ENGLISH DRAMA AT THE UNIVERSITIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		To a student of the Elizabethan drama one of the significant facts of the times is the great interest in the drama manifested by the universities and public schools throughout the period .

		Not only were plays from the classics revived , but original compositions in
Latin	LOCATION	in great numbers were written and performed be - fore the students , while many of the best productions of the English dramatists of the period were acted with great applause at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The uni - versities , too , turned out , with or without honors , many of the most accomplished Elizabethan playwrights and poets , and in one way or another took no inconsiderable part in the development of that great drama which is now the pride of English-speaking people .

		In these days of
Independent Theatres	ORGANIZATION	and of uni - versity revivals of classic Greek and Latin plays , is it not a little singular that the universities do not go a step farther and attempt the revival of some of the neglected classic plays of English literature , as well as of Greek and Latin literature ?

		Nothing could more strikingly serve both to emphasize and to promote the reviving interest in the study of English literature than attempts of this sort .

		It may be trusted that the an - cient Puritanism of our colleges is sufficiently mellowed by time ere this to permit such a vanity , and surely among the many new methods of teaching literature none could be more engaging to the healthy taste of youth than this , and none could serve to connect the study more closely with life .

		MORE `` RECOLLECTIONS OF A HAPPY LIFE . ''

		* Those who have read
Marianne North	ORGANIZATION	's '' Recollections of a Happy Life '' will approve the publishing by the editor , Mrs.
J. A. Sy	PERSON	- monds , of a supplementary volume of '' Further Recollections '' containing certain earlier chap - ters of
Miss North	ORGANIZATION	's journals omitted from the original work .

		We may say at once that while the new volume lacks the scientific interest of its predecessor , it easily surpasses it in wit and vivacity .

		The chapters now given were orig - inally omitted , chiefly , as the editor tells us , because the journeys described were over what is nowadays comparatively well-trodden ground an objection , however , which loses force in the case of narrators whose '' travel-pictures , '' like Miss North 's , are largely a reflection of tem - perament .

		Miss North had , in a special sense , her own way of seeing things .

		What she des - cribes comes to us tinged and refracted , as it were , through a quite peculiar medium ; so that it really matters little in point of novelty whether her observations are made from the deck of a
Nile	ORGANIZATION	dahabieh or from the top of a
Brompton	LOCATION	omnibus , the results being in either case largely out of the average ken .

		The most objective and guide-lookish of Miss North 's descriptions have , however , a certain value of their own , in that they enable us to con - trast the travel of thirty years ago with the more convenient , if less picturesque , methods of our own day .

		Railways and
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's steamers had not then , in
Spain	LOCATION	and on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, quite supplanted the leisurely arrangements of more primitive travel .

		The jogging , jingling cara - van of mules is now , almost everywhere , a thing of the past ; so is the old Spanish diligence a delightful vehicle in which Miss North was whirled '' at a furious pace over zig-zag passes and round shoulders of the

		a few more years have made travel , as the edi - tor laments , '' everywhere exactly alike . '' ''

		Further Recollections '' is essentially a trans - cript of the journals kept by the author from
1859	DATE	to
1870	DATE	, while travelling with her father in
Spain	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and the
Levant	PERSON	.

		The thread of continuity supplied in the open - ing volume by the scientific purpose of the writer 's later journeyings , is here lacking .

		It is distinctly the work of a younger woman of a fresh young girl with a fair stock of read - ing and a vast stock of animal spirits , whose keen enjoyment of the novelties of foreign travel is bracingly manifest in every page of her diary .

		Miss North was a specially stout - hearted and independent traveller , one of the sort whose elasticity of spirits is more than proof against the annoyances and discomforts that form the melancholy refrain of the narra - tives of less resolute pilgrims .

		The direst mis - hap serves , with her , to point a jest .

		At the very start , for instance , a precious portmanteau -LRB- one portmanteau , containing everything that this admirable woman thought necessary for a journey of several months -RRB- fell overboard in the harbor at St. Heliers : '' Everything was thoroughly soaked , and had to be spread out separately to dry ; all my paints , paper , and dress -LRB- only one -RRB- ; for we took the least possible luggage , and yet had everything we really needed , even luxu - ries ^ -RRB- including a bonnet , whose crown I used to stuff with a compact roll of stockings and cram into a hole left for it amongst my underclothing , just big enough to contain it : when taken out it would be damped and set in the sun , with the stockings still in the crown , and it stretched itself into proper shape again , and was the admiration of all beholders . ''

		Very different , we may note in passing , from
Miss North	LOCATION	's slender effects must have been the baggage train of the American ladies -LRB- the '' Skinners of
Boston	LOCATION	'' -RRB- whom she saw later at
Phila	LOCATION	?

		tripping about among the rel - ics of the Pharaohs , appropriately dressed '' in
Worth	LOCATION	's very latest fashions , '' and con - voyed by a male apparition clad '' in a com - plete suit of cineraria color , from stockings to cap . ''

		Sarcastic Miss North !

		She even goes on to say that , owing to this '' Yankee incur - sion '' -LRB- that is her disrespectful expression -RRB- from the
Back Bay	LOCATION	, '' the place lost half its charm , '' etc. .

		A pleasanter American experience was her meeting with
Miss Hosmer	PERSON	in
Rome	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	. ''

		Once Miss Raincock took me to see
Gibson	PERSON	's young American pupil ,
Miss Hosmer	PERSON	, in a large unfurnished studio she had just taken , where she was preparing to make a portrait statue of some famous countryman , it was to be nine feet high , she said -LRB- looking herself like
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 a small child -RRB- ; she had only one chair , which she gave me , as the stranger ; seating our old friend on the table , she mounted to the top of a high ladder herself , from whence she chattered and laughed with the happy air of one who is sure to please .

		Miss Raincock had once re - ceived a note from
Gibson	PERSON	, That poor American girl has fever , come and nurse her , ' so she had packed up her old carpet-bag and gone at once to obey the order , thus forming a friendship for life . ''

		But Miss North 's turn for satirical portrait - ure was by no means reserved for Americans .

		Among the most amusing of her '' Innocents Abroad '' was a Frenchman , a fellow-passenger on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	boat , who was , she rather naively complains , '' absurdly national and unlike us in everything '' Curiously enough ,
Monsieur	PERSON	, on his side , seems to have been observing his English companions , and making , mutatis mu - tandis , the same conclusions about them .

		Says Miss North : '' He got up late in the
morning	TIME	, and came into the saloon in demi-toilette as we were finishing our break - fast , having been ' strangled ' and frozen entirely by the cold , and , mon Dieu !

		he had no appetite !

		he would take a glass of lemonade and his narghile , and lecture us in the most polite and unreasonable way about the betise and English barbarism of fatiguing the stomach so early in the morning by eating ; after a little while he would get faint with hunger , and declare the cold would kill him , and , mon Dieu 1 he would die if he got nothing to eat till so late , and Achmet ya Achmet !

		and then he began gorging like a boa-constrictor , stopping every now and then to explain how much better the food would have been if , etc. , after which he began smoking again , and tried to draw , but , mon Dieu !

		he had no time ; if he only had time he could do something of true merit ... Mr.
S.	PERSON	confided to me that the Frenchman went to bed clothes and all , and that his toilette in the morning consisted of a thorough brushing downwards with the same brush , beginning with his hair , then his green velvet coat , and lastly his dear shining boots , c'est tout , voila !

		He also complained that he could not get filtered water to wash in ; if he could not get it filtered he would not wash his ' figure ' at all .

		He was told
Madame	ORGANIZATION	only used that of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	for hers . '

		Madame was too good to complain , and besides she was an Englishwoman , bah ' ! ''

		Miss North visited
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1865	DATE	, and she gives a lively account of the country and peo - ple and of her own experiences .

		The route from
Alexandria	LOCATION	-LRB- `` a nasty , mongrel , mosquito - ish place '' -RRB- to
Cairo	LOCATION	reminded her of the fens of Ely ; but the country was richly cropped with cotton and Indian corn , with scarcely a tree to break the monotony of the view , and but few villages .

		The cottages were merely square blocks of hardened mud , windowless and with the flat roofs covered with pigeons , chickens , and cats ; primitive ploughs , like the ancient models in old Egyptian carvings , were scratch - ing the rich soil .

		`` The natives had that calm , soft type of countenance that marks the old statuary of their country , large eyes and gentle expression , but no strength of character , and one could easily see that the old sculptors had before their eyes the ancestors of the present race , and that , though the ruling classes might be changed in
Egypt	LOCATION	, the fellahs or original population of the land are of the same blood as their forefathers . ''

		Books might be filled , says Miss North , with the architectural wonders of
Cairo	LOCATION	, its elaborate arabesques , and lacelike patterns in stone-work , plaster , and wood-carving .

		The tombs outside the city were the greatest gems of all , though they were only visited by flights of falcons or stray Arab wanderers .

		Europeans seemed pop - ular with the people , who were fond of showing off any words they knew .

		Miss North 's donkey - man , like most of his tribe , was a special lin - guist .

		He knew '' a few words of many lan - guages , and made the most of them by trans - posing and reversing their order in a sentence ; for instance , ' gentleman like donkey , ' ' no gen - tleman like donkey , ' ` donkey no like gentleman . '

		He told his beast where to go , and the clever creature trotted off right or left accordingly .

		` Donkey speak English , ' then the donkey always put its ears back and kicked out behind , '' a proceeding reminding one of the intelligent animal that carried
Silas Wegg	PERSON	to ''
Boflinses Bower	PERSON	'' on a memorable occasion .

		The author confesses to having regarded things Egyptian '' from a purely picturesque point , '' and was scolded for this by the
Cairo	LOCATION	clergyman 's wife : '' ' Dear , dear , like all travellers , you wander hither and thither and see nothing with a proper object , every - thing from a false point of view .

		I suppose you never considered that on the precise spot where those Mame - luke tombs stand the Israelites made their bricks with - out straw ! '

		And her husband took us to the top of a hill and showed us the very stone on which Moses stood to count the Israelites as they passed out of
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		The start from
Cairo	LOCATION	was made the day after
Christmas	DATE	, and the author 's record of the en - suing
Nile	ORGANIZATION	voyage is studded with characteristic bits of vivid , semi-humourous description .

		At
Luxor	LOCATION	,
Miss North	ORGANIZATION	visited the eccentric Lady
Duff Gordon	PERSON	, whom she had seen twenty-five years before .

		Lady
Lucie	PERSON	was picturesquely installed in some rooms raised up amongst the pillars of an old temple , '' like a second story '' : '' She herself was old and gray , but had still the handsome face which had captivated me then , in spite of having burst two blood-vessels that year , and she said the air at
Luxor	LOCATION	did wonders for her .

		The natives all worshipped her , and she doctored them , amused them , and even smoked with them .

		They looked on her as something mysterious , and even rather uncanny , and respected her accordingly . ''

		Later , at
Karnak	LOCATION	,
Miss North	LOCATION	was rather 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, startlingly reminded of one of Lady
Gordon	PERSON	's early eccentricities : '' Once while painting , and quite absorbed in my work at
Karnak	LOCATION	, a man sat down close to me , and I said ' Good morning , ' without looking up , till Hassan pulled my dress , and , oh horror !

		the man was holding a huge golden snake by the tail , a yard of shining , polished , slippery snake , quite straight and looking at me !

		I shouted and sprang away , and Hassan drove off the two wretched brutes .

		They take out the fangs of these tame snakes , but I hate even the sight of them now , though I used to like poor
Lucie	PERSON	's pet when I was a child . ''

		The justness of the following description of our heroine 's first crocodiles will be recognized by those familiar with both terms of her com - parison : '' One day we saw seven crocodiles , looking like rocks or shadows on the sand ; we were disputing if they were really crocodiles , when the huge creatures curved their backs with a violent effort , raised themselves on what our Frenchman called their ` pattes , ' and slid slowly into the water , as a fat lady descends from her car - riage , with a certain waddle and air of importance . ''

		Everything in
Thebes	LOCATION	appeared to Miss North '' too stupendous , '' seeming , as she says , '' To blunt my poor wits and pencil too , no cutting could get the wretched thing to draw straight ; and then the flocks of Americans and ' backsheesh ' people drove all peace away .

		The little women of eleven or twelve years old , who carried water jars on their heads , only supported by the palm of one hand , keeping up with our fast donkeys at a run , were very bewitching , with their bright eyes and easy graceful movements .

		They said they were all ladies , not girls , meaning they were married . '

		You got wife ? '

		they asked me . '

		Oh yes , you have in house in
England	LOCATION	! '

		as if I locked up my husband at home as they do their wives here . ''

		Near the caves of Beni Hassan the writer en - countered her first Egyptian `` saint , '' who seems to have been , in some points , very like his historic prototypes : '' One morning we were surprised to see Achmet and the
Reis	PERSON	go on shore amicably together , after incessant squabbling , for a walk , but a few minutes later a wild head with a mop of hair came suddenly out of the water and up the boat 's side , and its owner seated himself on the edge and tied himself into a petticoat which he had brought on the top of the mop , and then proceeded to kiss all the sailors , who did not enjoy it , while we shrank closer into our cabin shell .

		The poor fellows all gave him some coppers , and after he had adminis - tered another hugging all round , he took off and folded up his petticoat , put it on his head , and dived and swam off to a boat full of corn near us , to levy the same tax .

		They said he was mad , and consequently a saint , and thus gained his own livelihood . ''

		We shall close our extracts from
Miss North	ORGANIZATION	's journals with the following description of the journalist herself , given by the Egyptian pilot who took the Norths up the river : '' This Bint was unlike most other English Bints , be - ing , firstly , .

		white and lively ; secondly , she was gracious in her manner , and of kind disposition ; thirdly , she at - tended continually to her father , whose days went in re - joicing that he had such a Bint ; fourthly , she repre - sented all things on paper , she drew all the temples of
Nubia	LOCATION	, all the Sakkiahs , and all the men and women and nearly all the palm trees ; she was a valuable and remarkable Bint . ''

		The portrait is certainly more complimentary to its subject than to English '' Bints '' -LRB- we confess to some uncertainty as to the meaning of this term -RRB- in general .

		There are three illustrations , including por - traits of the author and her father , and a pen - sketch , by a fellow-traveler , which is so absurdly bad that it is difficult to account for its inclu - sion .

		AN EVOLUTIONIST 'S ALARM .

		* Professor
Calderwood	PERSON	's work on '' Evolution and Man 's Place in Nature '' belongs to a class of books that may not inaptly be designated as '' buffers . ''

		Their service is to soften the shock between new scientific doctrine and the dogmas of popular religion .

		This work has been done for the science of geology , and is now rapidly doing for the new biology that dates from
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Those who have never experienced the need of a reconciliation be - tween religion and science , and those who pre - fer to devise their own systems of '' accommo - dation , '' will take but a moderate interest in '' buffers . ''

		Acute metaphysical minds will find , in some form of Berkeleian idealism , a way out from the disconsolate vision of a merely me - chanical world , in which Darwinism , on a first hasty interpretation , seemed to issue .

		Crude literal materialism has been proved unthinka - ble , they will argue .

		Matter that contains in itself the power and potency of all forms of life and thought must be conceived as the man - ifestation of a power most nearly akin to what we know as mind .

		Belief in such a world - soul would seem mere pantheism .

		But it did not seem so to
Berkeley	LOCATION	; and
Berkeley	LOCATION	was right .

		With the Infinite and Unknowable , all things are possible .

		We can not tell how far the roots of personality penetrate into the real nature of things ; and since we have no right to dogmatize on either side , we may properly throw the weight of our moral and religious feelings into the scale of hope .

		Evolution ex - plains the process , it does not explain away the fact , of creation .

Henry Calderwood	PERSON	, LL.D .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL win ism , when the storm of controversy has died down , will be found to have left unshaken the pillars of man 's faith in his higher spiritual destiny .

		But there are many estimable persons who refuse to be soothed by these subtle considera - tions .

		Their alarmed imaginations require visible tangible barriers of defense something like Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	's Rubicon of lan - guage `` which no brute will dare to cross . ''

		And it is for these that Professor
Calderwood	PERSON	's book is chiefly designed .

		He finds that the continuity of evolution is interrupted at three points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- at the creation of organic life , -LRB- 2 -RRB- at the appearance of mind , -LRB- 3 -RRB- at the advent of '' rational life . ''

		At each of these points he erects a barrier and assumes a direct interven - tion of the living source of all existence .

		In defense of the first barrier , he offers no argu - ment beyond the generally acknowledged fact that spontaneous generation can not now be ex - perimentally verified .

		In separating by a sharp line of demarcation '' rational life '' from animal life , he follows Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	, whose arguments he amplifies into an elaborate rhetorical expo - sition of the many distinctive qualities that differentiate the developed nineteenth century man from the animals .

		The one novel feature of his teaching is the affirmation -LRB- p. 340 -RRB- that '' the inferior type of mind recognized as be - longing to the higher animals can not be ac - counted for by evolution from sensory appa - ratus any more than rational power can be thus explained . ''

		Sensibility is coexistent with life .

		But no one , Professor
Calderwood	PERSON	argues , would make mind coexistent with life , for that would be to assign mind to the oyster , and pass as by a dissolving view into the Hegelian monism .

		The difference between sense-discrimination and mind , or intelligence proper , is that the latter not only distinguishes sensations , but recognizes their significance , interprets them as signs of something else .

		The power of the higher animals to do this , the ability of a dog , for example , to understand our signs , can not be accounted for by the structure of the brain .

		To explain it we must assume a higher form of intelligence independent of the organism , and yet radically distinct from the active power of inventing signs for his own ra - tional or moral ends , which is the peculiar pre - rogative of man .

		It would seem that the poor Indian 's untutored mind was not so far astray , after all , in thinking that , '' Admitted to that equal sky , His faithful dog shall bear him company . ''

		It is hardly worth while to attempt to clear up the psychological misconceptions involved in this ratiocination .

		The rigid distinction be - tween mere sense-discrimination in the oyster and the interpretation of sensation in the higher animals is of course untenable , for the simple reason that there is no case of sense-discrimi - nation unaccompanied by a corresponding in - terpretation .

		Even the amoeba interprets soft as organic and digestible , and hard as inor - ganic and indigestible , and shapes its action accordingly .

		And from the amoeba to the dog the correspondence between immediate sensa - tion and consequent action based on '' inter - pretation '' develops too gradually to admit of the drawing of any absolute dividing line .

		We may say , if we please , that the reaction in the amoeba is purely physiological or mechanical , while in the dog it is accompanied by conscious - ness .

		But the only basis for such an asser - tion would be the fact that the dog has a brain and the amoeba has none .

		And Professor
Cal	LOCATION	- derwood 's contention is that the higher facul - ties of the dog are in no way expressed in his physical structure .

		In fact , the attempt to '' draw the line '' anywhere except between man and the animals is not a serious issue in con - temporary speculation , and the loose reasoning of this book will not make it one .

		THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC .

		* '' There is nothing in history more strange and yet more true than the story that has been told so often , but which never palls in its interest , that of the life of the maiden through whose instrumentality
France	LOCATION	re - gained her place among the nations . ''

		Thus does the latest historian of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc introduce his story of her life .

		And he adds : ''
Sainte Beuve	PERSON	has written that , in his opinion , the way to honor the history of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc is to tell the truth about her as simply as possible .

		This has been my object in the following pages . ''

		It is no reproach to
Lord Ronald	PERSON	that he has told the story of the heroine whom his mother loved -LRB- u my mother , '' he says , '' had what the French call a culte '' for
Joan	PERSON	of Arc -RRB- rather as the affectionate admirer than the cold-blooded critic .

		There are times , indeed , when the ju - dicial spirit looks ungraceful , especially in a young man .

		The book is written in a style of graphic simplicity , with as little affectation in * JoAN OF ARC .

		68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, the point of view or arrangement as in the dic - tion .

		Through his very straightforwardness and idiomatic energy , the author often grows truly impressive and pathetic ; while we never lose our faith in his truthfulness or his common sense .

		He has graphically rendered
Jeanne	PERSON	's lovable qualities those qualities that saints and martyrs , alas I do not inevitably possess .

		She is more than
Michelet	PERSON	's woman of genius in these pages more even than De Quincey 's heroic saint .

		To
Lord Ronald	PERSON	, whose research has breathed the breath of life into this dim and lovely shade , she is just the gentle , infin - itely compassionate , but not unwise woman , who is the guardian angel in her family , or her village , or her nation , as opportunity may offer .

		Her people were well-to-do farmers , her father holding a certain position in the com - munity as the oldest inhabitant -LRB- doyen -RRB- of the village , and ranking next to the mayor .

		The family owned '' about twenty acres of land , twelve of which were arable , four were meadow - lands , and four were used for fuel . ''

		Besides this , they had some two to three hundred francs kept safe for use in case of emergency , and the furniture , goods , and chattels of their modest home . ''

		All told , the fortune of the family of
Joan	PERSON	attained an annual income of about two hundred pounds of our money . ''

		A thousand dollars a year needs doubling , if not trebling , to reduce it to our standard ; and Lord
Ronald	PERSON	very sensibly remarks that it was '' a not in - considerable revenue at that time ; and with it they were enabled to raise a family in comfort , and to give alms and hospitality to the poor . ''

		Of this family ,
Jeanne	PERSON	was the fifth child , and , it would appear , was rather indulged by her parents .

		She was not , for all the wonder - ful visions that saved
France	LOCATION	, a mystic or a sol - itary ; she joined in all the sports of her play - mates , and was a leader and a favorite . ''

		She loved her mother tenderly , and in her trial she bore witness before men to the good influence that she had derived from that parent ... All that we gather of
Joan	PERSON	's early years proves her nature to have been a compound of love and goodness ... From her earliest years she loved to help the weak and poor ; she was known , when there was no room for the weary wayfarer to pass the night in her parents ' house , to give up her bed to him , and to sleep on the floor by the hearth . ''

		She was a pious little girl , and loved to lis - ten at her mother 's knee to the recital of the marvels of the saints ; she was also patriotic , and almost as dearly loved to hear the brave deeds of Frenchmen in war .

		Her mother would rehearse these legends while spinning ; and the little , glowing-faced maid would listen while her heart swelled .

		But though she felt intensely , she was a reticent child .

		No doubt the worthy Isambeau , or Mere D'Arc , some - times whispered to a confidant that Joan '' was never one to talk , but as good and willing a child as ever breathed , '' for , after all , vary the idiom , and the language of mothers is the same in all tongues and all generations .

		Per - haps , had the mother lived she might have per - suaded
Joan	PERSON	out of her visions which had been the better for Mere d' Arc 's daughter , and the worse for
France	LOCATION	.

		It was a strange , heavy time , a time of dreams and portents , a time of misery in many forms .

		There had been famines and horri - ble new diseases .

		The crazed and starving peasants had risen in revolt , aimlessly striking at the nearest , rushing about like mad dogs , biting , and being at last hunted down , at the end of a useless , brutal , bloody struggle .

		There were two popes , and religion itself seemed shaken .

		Society was in a ferment .

		In such times superstition flourishes .

		To Frenchmen especially , the day was full of bitterness .

		The French king had been stripped of his provinces until there remained to the dauphin , north of the
Loire	LOCATION	, only '' a pitiful half-dozen places . ''

		No wonder visions came to the French maiden whose heart was hot with brooding over the humiliation of her country !

		Whatever they were and we need not follow
Michelet	PERSON	into an ingenious psychical dissertation , since
Joan	PERSON	's character depends on their veracity not at all , .

		she undoubtedly counted them real , '' and was not disobedient to the heavenly vision . ''

		It is a wonderful tale , that of her determin - ing to forsake all that she loved , to lead th & troops of the dauphin , '' out of the great pity that she felt for the land of
France	LOCATION	'' ; her jour - ney to the dauphin , and the manner in which her superb enthusiasm , her modesty , and her natural shrewd sense conquered first the com - mon people -LRB- who never fail to respond , for good or evil , to the note of genuine and tre - mendous earnestness -RRB- , then the soldiers and the nobles , last of all the priests themselves .

		Was the Maid a great general ?

		Was she a leader ?

		Or was she simply an enthusiast who came at the right moment ?

		No one can read the most direct accounts without suspecting that
Joan	PERSON	had a long head .

		She knew nothing of the technique of war which , it is to be remembered , was simpler far in those days than these , but she intuitively seized upon the wisest plan of campaign , pos - sibly because it was the most daring .

		Her per -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 sonal courage is as well established as anything can be .

		Lord
Ronald	PERSON	loves to dwell on it .

		Wounded at the siege of
Orleans	LOCATION	, she pulled out the arrow with her own hands , and then -LRB- having piously made her confession -RRB- returned to the fray and inspired the wavering soldiers .

		At Jargeau , '' A stone from a catapult struck
Joan	PERSON	on the helmet as she was in the act of mounting a ladder she fell back , stunned , into the ditch , but soon revived , and rising , with her undaunted courage , she turned to hearten her followers , declaring that the victory would be theirs .

		In a few moments the place was in possession of the French . ''

		At
Troyes	ORGANIZATION	, the king , considering attack of so strongly fortified a place hopeless , would have abandoned the expedition to
Rheims	LOCATION	-LRB- since he dared not leave such a hornets ' nest in his rear -RRB- ; but
Joan	PERSON	pushed on the preparations for attack with such ingenious and overwhelming energy that the citizens of Troyes surrendered without a blow .

		Thus Charles advanced to
Rheims	LOCATION	, and was crowned King of
France	LOCATION	.

		No wonder her biographer exclaims enthusiastically : '' How had she been able not only to learn the tactics of a campaign , the rudiments of the art of war , but even the art itself ?

		No one had shown a keener eye for se - lecting the weakest place to attack , or where artillery and culverin fire could be used with most effect , or had been quicker to avail himself of these weapons .

		No one saw with greater rapidity -LRB- that rarest of military gifts -RRB- when the decisive moment had arrived for a sudden attack , or had a better judgment for the right moment to head a charge and assault . ''

		And he adds that the professional soldiers about her could only explain her victories by the be - lief '' that in
Joan	PERSON	of Arc was united not only the soul of patriotism and a faith to move mountains , but the qualities of a great captain as well . ''

		All testimony agrees that
Joan	PERSON	was more than a narrow zealot .

		She had nothing of the furious , almost venomous , partisanship that sometimes darkens her sex 's devotion to a cause .

		Because she was a French patriot she was not therefore a hater of the English .

		Memoirs of her are full of her compassion for the foe .

		She ministered to the English wounded after the fight ; '' as far as she could , she prevented pil - lage '' ; even in the fury of battle she restrained her followers .

		Indeed , as Lord
Ronald	PERSON	says , '' she may be considered the precursor of all the noble hearts who in modern warfare follow armies in order to alleviate and help the sick and wounded . ''

		This were enough , had Joan no other claim on our reverence , to win it .

		The peasant from
Domremy	ORGANIZATION	was the first of the Red Cross knights .

		Even at this distant time , it is a painful task to follow the cruel ending of the story .

		The intrigues of jealous courtiers and of unsuccess - ful and envious captains on the French side helped the open enmity of the English .

		Their motives are clear enough : to discredit
Charles	PERSON	's title , their only hope was to show that the Maid was a witch , thus putting the king in the odious position of being in collusion with the powers of evil .

		Joan was wounded , captured , sold to the English ; and the ensuing drama was in - evitable .

		She was tried as a sorceress .

		Lord
Ronald	PERSON	quotes very fully from the notes of the proces-verbal , and it is interesting to see , even in this record of her enemies , how clearly the large sense and elevation of mind of this wonder - ful girl appear .

		When asked in what language her voices conversed , '' They speak to me in soft and beautiful French voices , '' said she . ''

		Does not Saint
Margaret	PERSON	speak in English ? ''

		was the instant inquiry . ''

		How should she , '' was her answer , '' when she is not on the En - glish side ? ''

		She disclaimed anything miraculous in the revival of an apparently dead infant because of her prayers ; she said , as she had said at the time when the populace besought her to cure sickness by the touch of her rings , that she could not cure the sick .

		She refused steadily to betray anything that might harm the king , who had made no effort to save her .

		Once Beaupere asked her the usual mediaeval test question , whether she was in a state of grace .

		She avoided the presumption of confidence and the danger of denial in much the same manner that an English martyr did later , answering : '' If I am not , may God place me in it ; if I am already , may He keep me in it . ''

		When asked what she thought of the murder of the
Duke of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	, she answered out of a pure and merciful heart ; and no statesman could have spoken more wisely , since she neither in - culpates
Charles	PERSON	nor approves the infamous act .

		She said : '' It was a great misfortune for the kingdom of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		But where the victim is condemned before - hand , what avails defence ?

		There is no need to repeat the brutal and treacherous devices of
Beauvais	PERSON	.

		He was paid his price and earned his wages .

		Baffled by
Joan	PERSON	's constancy , her enemies did not scruple to resort to torture as a persuader of confession .

		They brought
Joan	PERSON	to the rack ; and there are few nobler answers than the words spoken by this lonely girl , de - serted by all except her dauntless soul , sick and feeble , and exhausted by a most cruel im - 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, prisonment . ''

		Even , '' she said , '' if you tear me limb from limb , and even if you kill me , I will not tell you anything further .

		And even were I forced to do so , I should afterwards de - clare that it was only because of the torture that I had spoken differently . ''

		But when fear failed , fraud succeeded .

		Just what happened at the stake , where
Joan	PERSON	was persuaded to make what was proclaimed by the English to be a recantation , it is difficult to de - cide .

		De Quincey vehemently rejects the '' cal - umny , '' as he calls it .

		Michelet believes that she tried to save her life ; '' whether she said the word , is uncertain ; but 1 affirm that she thought it , '' is his phrase .

		But
Michelet	PERSON	had his own theories of women , which it was ne - cessary to his peace of mind that he should support in the case of every woman ; and a little twisting was sometimes necessary .

		It appears from obtainable evidence that
Joan	PERSON	, how worked upon , who shall say ?

		did put her mark to something that day in the square at
Rouen	LOCATION	, when she was brought to the stake and taken away .

		In view of her courage be - fore and of her fortitude afterward , the most likely solution is that she was as much tricked as bullied into an abjuration that she only half comprehended .

		Certain it is that she seems to have believed herself to have only promised to abandon her man 's dress and to submit herself to the will of the church .

		Cochon 's plot appears the more atrocious the more it is investigated .

		The unfortunate girl protected her modesty at the cost of her life .

		She resumed the man 's dress that she was forbidden to wear ; and whether the danger were real , or only a base threat , it was equally efficacious .

		Joan was brought before her judges .

		She admitted that she had seen her supernatural guides , that they had told her that she had '' commited a bad deed '' in denying what she had done . ''

		Then , '' cried the bishop , `` you retract your abjura - tion ? ''

		`` It was , '' said
Joan	PERSON	and this is the clearest testimony we have on the vexed subject `` it was from the fear of being burnt that I re - tracted what I had done ; but I never intended to deny or revoke my voices . ''

		And when Cochon asked her if she no longer dreaded being burnt , she answered , '' I had rather die than endure any longer what I have now to undergo . ''

		Where - upon Cochon fared gaily to
Warwick	PERSON	and said to him in English , '' You can dine now with a good appetite .

		We have caught her at last . ''

		On the 30th of
May , 1431	DATE	, the next day but one ,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc met her dreadful fate .

		She died with a patience and constancy the first natural recoil past that affected even her judges and made an indelible impression on the weeping spectators .

		And not only on the spec - tators : the imagination of
France	LOCATION	has never been more deeply stirred .

		Twenty years later , the French clergy , after a solemn trial , reha - bilitated the memory of
Joan	PERSON	.

		Her family was ennobled , and monuments were erected by the king to the giver of his crown : a tardy jus - tice , to which , however , was added what
Joan	PERSON	would have valued more than all the endur - ing love of her countrymen .

		Lord
Gower	PERSON	's book is printed and illustrated sumptuously ; the etched illustrations of the scenes of the story being supplied by Mr.
Lee Latrobe Bateman	PERSON	, who made the sketches from the spot during a pious journey which Lord
Ronald	PERSON	and he made together to the scenes of
Joan	PERSON	's life .

		It is seldom , I may add , that one leaves a work of history with a feeling of more confidence in the research , judgment , and con - scientious fidelity of the historian .

		OCTAVE THANET .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The two volumes of '' Studies of the Greek Poets '' . '

		b y the lat f J - A - .

		sy - monds , have just been reissued in a stately third edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a few changes from earlier forms of the text .

		Of these changes , the only one at all noteworthy is the new chapter upon the recently discovered mimes of He - rondas , which includes long translated passages .

		The chapters have been arranged in a better chrono - logical order than before , some further translations have been inserted , and an occasional footnote ap - pended .

		In one of these foot-notes , the author gives his reasons for not re-casting more fully the text of the work .

		`` Owing to the way in which they were first composed , it is impossible to avoid a certain amount of repetition without a laborious re-casting and re-writing of all the chapters .

		That would involve a thorough-going change of style , and would deprive the work of the one quality it claims youthfulness . ''

		We think it best , on the whole , that such a revision should not have been attempted , for the '' youthfulness '' of the work that is , its spirit of generous enthusiasm for its subject is the very quality that has made it the most useful , if not the most important , of the author 's many books .

		For young readers , whether students of Greek or not , these chapters offer the best introduction in our language to the study of Greek literature ; and in these days , when the value of that study is ques - tioned more than ever before , such books are capa - ble of doing a world of good .

		We do not know , either , that the author 's riper judgment could have
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 given better form to the general conclusions result - ing from the study of Greek thought as expressed in Greek poetry .

		Such a passage as the following , for example , is wholly admirable : '' We must imi - tate the Greeks , not by trying to reproduce their bygone modes of life and feeling , but by approxi - mating to their free and fearless attitude of mind .

		While frankly recognizing that much of their lib - erty would for us be license , and that the moral progress of the race depends on holding with a firm grasp what the Greeks had hardly apprehended , we ought still to emulate their spirit by cheerfully ac - cepting the world as we find it , acknowledging the value of each human impulse , and aiming after vir - tues that depend on self-regulation rather than on total abstinence and mortification .

		To do this in the midst of our conventionalities and prejudices , our interminglement of unproved expectations and unrefuted terrors , is no doubt hard .

		Yet if we fail of this , we lose the best the Greeks can teach us . ''

		A book so sane in its essential doctrine may well be pardoned a few outbursts of florid rhetoric and a certain amount of exuberant verbosity .

		It is doubt - less open to much minor criticism , as , for example , in the passage which speaks of Moliere 's '' courtly and polished treatment of disgusting subjects '' a comment that does not come with good grace from one who censures
Hallam	PERSON	for precisely the same sort of comment upon
Marlowe	PERSON	; but criticism of this sort we are willing to forego , contenting our - selves with an emphatic protest against the publica - tion of such a work without an index .

		... .

		.

		Mr.
William Renton	PERSON	's '' Outlines of A diagrammatic ... treatment of English Literature -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a English Literature .

		University Extension Manual , '' and , as such , hardly appears to fulfil its purpose .

		As an introduction to the subject it would be found confusing , although it has much suggestiveness for readers who already know the history of our liter - ature .

		Its defect , as far as beginners are concerned , is found in its insistence upon a rather obscure sys - tem of philosophical classification and criticism .

		It professes to deal with types , schools , and epochs rather than with individuals , but the interest of the beginner is only to be awakened by an extremely individual method of treatment .

		He is told , for example , that
Marlowe	PERSON	's chief discovery was '' that in the universal and a posteriori , not the excep - tional and the a priori , is to be found the true source of human interest and interpretation '' from which statement he is not likely to learn much .

		Mr.
Renton	PERSON	makes use of many ingenious formu - las and diagrams in illustration of his subject .

		The formula for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for example , is this : -LRB- s - j - p -RRB- S - j - -LRB- v - -LRB- - h -RRB- T , which , being interpreted , means '' spontaneity and pregnancy of Suggestion combined with variety and harmony of Treatment . ''

		When the scientific treatment of literature culmi - nates in such pseudo-mathematical forms of expres - sion , it is time to call a halt .

		The variety and in - genuity of the author 's diagrams for he makes much use of the graphic method , as well as of the algebraical defy any attempt at mere description .

		One of the less complicated of the figures gives us the abstraction Nature as a centre , and groups about it , at quadrant intervals , the four other ab - stractions , Will , Soul , Sense , and Spirit .

		The names of eight nineteenth century poets link together the circles representing these abstractions ; thus ,
Byron	PERSON	is the poet of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	and Will ,
Shelley of Nature	ORGANIZATION	and Soul ,
Keats of Nature and Sense	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth of Nature and Spirit	ORGANIZATION	.

		In an outer circle ,
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	is linked with Will by Mr.
Roden Noel	PERSON	-LRB- whose name had to be dragged in for the sake of diagrammatic symmetry -RRB- , Will with Soul by
Browning	PERSON	, Soul with Sense by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and Sense with Spirit by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The description of such a diagram is its best reductio ad absurdam .

		The structure of literature is too organic to admit of being thus me - chanically explained .

		The author seems to be fairly accurate as to historical fact and sane as to criticism , although we do not agree with him in making Balzac inferior to
Thackeray	LOCATION	, in singling out Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Tristram of Lyonesse '' as one of the poet 's most remarkable works , or in a. number of other and minor matters .

		And it is at least amusing to be told that
Berkeley	LOCATION	, in '' The Querist , '' '' anticipated the
Political Economy of Smith	ORGANIZATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	would not thank the author for that .

		Sismondi 's `` Rdpubliques Italiennes , '' A condensed , H .

		i history of the in ten volumes , albeit a work which Italian Republic , .

		fagcinateS5 is some what formidable to one who is seeking a general knowledge of the Ital - ian city republics of the middle ages .

		Miss
Duffy	PERSON	has done well to give us a portion of all this in a single volume , in her '' Tuscan Republics and
Ge	ORGANIZATION	- noa '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Considering the length of cen - turies that she deals with , and the lack of unity involved in a history of five states
Genoa	LOCATION	,
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Lucca	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Siena	LOCATION	, she has produced a. very successful narrative .

		She truly emphasizes the fact that communal institutions here did not come down from the Roman time , but sprang up amid the confusion and neglect of the Germanic settlements and the early feudal period .


Florence	LOCATION	, as is right , gets the largest treatment , and the narrative is well handled as it passes from consuls to podestas , podestas to
Signoria	LOCATION	, and as the power is snatched by popolani from grandi , only to be handed over to Medici patrons and tyrants .

		It is a pity there is much slovenly writing in the volume , for a good book is worth making slowly .

		Such writing as , '' In other places , notable in
Lombardy	LOCATION	, '' '' con - ferred sole possession to the property , '' ``
Pisa	LOCATION	's wealth and outlaying interests , '' `` a change came over the government , '' is not creditable .

		An inter - preter is needed for such sentences as , ''
Florence	LOCATION	owed its final great prosperity to its position mid - way between the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coast and
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB- a map will not elucidate it -RRB- , or `` Henry IV .

		had conferred on
Lucca	LOCATION	the privilege of trading freely 72 -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, throughout his dominions , and this fact explains the passionate jealousy of
Pisa	LOCATION	, which , desirous of ex - panding inland , found an insurmountable obstacle to this aspiration of its neighbor . ''

		One would wish to have seen a fuller account of
Siena	LOCATION	and some recognition of
Arezzo	LOCATION	in a Tuscan history .

		.

		. ''

		Women of the Valois Court '' -LRB- Scrib - More portraits ... < r t _ of women of the ner -RRB- is the initial volume of a fresh sub-series by the indefatigable
M. Imbert de Saint	ORGANIZATION	-
Amand	LOCATION	.

		The volumes differ from their predecessors in that their interest is still more largely personal , each one containing a series of detached historical portraits .

		In the number before us , for instance , there are portraits , pictorial as well as verbal , of Marguerite of
Angouleme	LOCATION	and
Cather	PERSON	- ine de ' Medici , and , subordinately , of
Diane de Poitiers , Marguerite of Valois	ORGANIZATION	,
Marie Stuart	PERSON	, and others .

		The author 's style is as showy and vivacious as ever , and he has interwoven in his own narrative the usual proportion of quotations from the author - ities , and from diaries and letters , of the period .

		Balzac 's opinion of
Catherine	ORGANIZATION	is sufficiently striking .

		Nothing , not even
Saint Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	's , gives him pause in his enthusiasm for his heroine .

		In his eyes , '' the figure of Catherine de ' Medici appears like that of a great king .

		The calumnies once dis - pelled by facts , recovered with difficulty from the falsities and contradictions of pamphlets and anec - dotes , everything can be explained to the honor of this extraordinary woman , who had none of the weaknesses of her sex , who lived chastely in the midst of the amours of the most licentious court of
Europe	LOCATION	, and who , in spite of her meagre purse , was able to build admirable monuments , as if to repair the losses occasioned by the demolitions of the
Cal	LOCATION	- vinists , who inflicted as many wounds on art as on the body politic . ''

		The extracts in the volume , brought thus together in compact and accessible form , are of great value to the student .

		The book is withal full of romantic interest , and is more read - able than the general run of books that profess to be nothing else .

		In '' Orthometry '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr.
R	PERSON	- F *
Brewer	PERSON	has attempted a fuller treatment of the art of versification than is to be found in the popular treatises on that subject .

		While the preface shows a tendency to encourage verse-making , as unnecessary as it is un - desirable , the work may be regarded as useful in so far as it tends to cultivate an intelligent taste for good poetry .

		The rhyming dictionary at the end is a new feature , which will undoubtedly com - mend itself to those having a use for such aids .

		A specially interesting chapter is that on `` Poetic Trifles , '' in which are included the various imita - tions of foreign verse in English .

		The discussion of the sonnet , too , though failing to bring out fully the spiritual nature of this difficult verse form , is more accurate than might be expected from the following sentence : '' The form of the sonnet is of Italian origin , and came into use in the fifteenth -LSB- sic -RSB- century , towards the end of which its con - struction was perfected , and its utmost melodious sweetness attained in the verse of Petrarch and Dante . ''

		In the chapter on Alliteration there are several misleading statements , such as calling '' Piers the Plowman '' an '' Old English '' poem .

		In the bibliography one is surprised not to find Mr.
F. B. Gummere	PERSON	's admirable '' Handbook of Poetics , '' now in its third edition .

		In spite of these and other shortcomings , which can be readily corrected in a later issue , this work may be recommended as a sat - isfactory treatment of the mechanics of verse .

		Beautwrepnntof Th * P ubli h f s alrea -LRB- ty heard more the Hebrew text of or less of the translation of the ** Old Testament writings , undertaken sometime since by a group of the most eminent European and American Semitic scholars , and al - ready well under way .

		The projectors of this great enterprise have also included in their plans the pub - lication of the complete Hebrew text of the Old Testament , in a series of volumes to be the exact counterparts of those making up the English edi - tion .

		There will be twenty of these parts altogether , and , through the generosity of an unnamed friend of the enterprise , they are offered to subscribers at a very low price .

		Part the first , containing the text of the book of Job , edited by Professor
Siegfried	PERSON	, of
Jena	PERSON	, has just been issued , and , in its
Leipzig	LOCATION	typography , is a very beautiful piece of work .

		The text is printed in colors by a new process , the in - vention of Professor
Haupt	PERSON	, the general editor of the series .

		Interpolations and parallel compositions are thus distinguished from the primitive portions of the text , a feature which those who use the book will not be slow to appreciate .

		The text has been left unpointed except in ambiguous cases .

		The
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Press is the American agent for this work , and will receive subscriptions for the whole work or for the separate parts as issued .

Liukiu Islands	LOCATION	, and
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The book is edited by Captain
Pasfield Oliver	PERSON	, who , in his exhaustive Introduction , devotes himself to the rather unusual editorial task of pick - ing holes in his author 's narrative and impugning his veracity .

		Benyowsky was a Polish adventurer of the eighteenth century , one of those '' plausible , amusing , and good-looking , but wholly unprincipled ,
Don Juans	PERSON	, '' says Captain
Oliver	PERSON	, '' who would fight under any leader where plunder was to be gained . ''

		He was taken prisoner by the Russians in
1769	DATE	, but escaped shortly after and made his way to
Kamchatka	LOCATION	, from whence he sailed on his zig - za gg m g voyage in
Behring Sea	LOCATION	, the
Sea of Ochotsk	ORGANIZATION	, and the

		IJITERARY NOTES AND NEWS .

		The death of Mr.
Wilson Graham	PERSON	, who undertook five years ago the preparation of the
Chaucer Concord	ORGANIZATION	- ance , leaves the completion of the work to his colleague , Dr.
Fliigel	PERSON	, of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, to whom all out - standing slips should now be sent .

		At the Zola dinner mentioned in our last issue , the following bit of dialogue is reported to have taken place : General
Jung	PERSON	said to
M. Zola	PERSON	, `` You have writ - ten ' La De `` bkcle ' ; I hope you will write La Victoire . ' ''

		M. Zola replied , '' That ,
General	ORGANIZATION	, is more your business than mine . ''

		The following inscription is borne by the tablet re - cently placed upon the
Palazzo Verospi	PERSON	, at
Rome	LOCATION	: '' A
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	, che nella primavera del
1819	DATE	scrisse in questa casa ' H Prometeo ' e ' La Cenci . '

		II
Comune di Roma	ORGANIZATION	, cento anni dopo la nascita del poeta , sostenitore invitto delle liberta popolati , avversate ai sui tempi da tutta Europa , pose questo ricordo ,

		One
Babu Sarat Chandra Das	PERSON	, a Bengali pundit , who lived for some time in a Buddhist monastery at
Lhassa	LOCATION	, and who brought back with him a thorough knowledge of Tibetan language and literature , is now engaged upon an exhaustive dictionary of Tibetan , to be published by the government of
India	LOCATION	.

		He has also found time to write a popular narrative of his travels and experiences in
Tibet	LOCATION	, and thus throw open to English readers a country that has been closed for more than a century .

		The death-roll for
July	DATE	includes two names of high rank , that of Guy de Maupassant , who died on the 6th , and that of
Henry Nettleship	PERSON	, whose death was re - ported on the 10th .

		Maupassant was born in
1850	DATE	, trained himself for literary work under the direction of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and during the last dozen years of his life was a prolific writer of novels and short stories always admirable in manner , often far from admirable in mat - ter .

		The story of his illness is too fresh in the public mind to need recounting .

		Professor
Nettleship	PERSON	had not more than three or four equals among recent classical scholars in
England	LOCATION	.

		He was born in
1839	DATE	, and was identified with
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	throughout the greater part of his career .

		In
1878	DATE	, he became Corpus Professor of Latin , thus filling the chair formerly occupied by his old master and friend , Professor Conington .

		He com - pleted Conington 's '' Virgil '' and '' Persius , '' published 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, many papers on classical philology , and devoted many years to a proposed Latin-English lexicon , planned , then afterwards abandoned , by the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, the English novelist , who attended the recent Authors '
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	as a delegate from the
British Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, has written the fol - lowing appreciative letter to the President of the Aux - iliary Congresses , by whom it is given to the public .

		CHARLES C. DONKEY ,
Esq.	LOCATION	, President World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	.

		DEAR SIR : At the moment of leaving
Chicago	LOCATION	and the Literary Conference , I beg permission , in the name of Dr.
Sprigge	PERSON	and myself , and of the organization which we repre - sented at your
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to convey to you as president , and to the committee of organization of the Literary department , first , our most sincere congratulations on the success of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which is to-day concluded ; second , our most sin - cere thanks for the arrangements made for the reception of the English contributors , and for the great personal kindness shown to us and the trouble taken for us .

		Many papers were read most helpful and suggestive ; a great stimulus has been given to the consideration of all subjects connected with the advance of our common literature a lit - erature growing daily more international , while on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	it will preserve its natural distinctions .

		I ven - ture to express the earnest hope that in the interests of both countries the papers read and the speeches made during this week may be edited i. e. , reduced and condensed and pub - lished , and sent to all the principal libraries in the world of the Republic and the English Empire .

		Permit me , sir , if I may do so as a simple visitor , without the appearance of impertinence , to congratulate your splendid city on the place which this Exposition has enabled it to take among the great mother cities of the world .

		Among all your business activities , and in the eager pressing forward of your people , rejoicing in a vigorous youth , confident in a splendid future , reckless of what they spend because of the strength and resources within them , I rejoice to find springing up a new literature .

		Whatever be the future of this literature , which rises on the frontier line of East and West , it will be at least free from the old traditions .

		I wish for your authors that independence which we in the old country are straggling to conquer ; at least it will be their fault if they do not achieve it at the outset not the fault of the national char - acter , nor the fault of this
Literary Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		I leave your city with memories of the greatest kindness and hospitality .

		I can never sufficiently thank my friends here for their friendliness .

		I carry away a delightful memory , not so much of a
Chicago	LOCATION	rich , daring , young , and confident , as of a
Chicago	LOCATION	which has conceived and carried into execu - tion the most beautiful and poetic dream a place surpassing the imagination of man , as man is commonly found and a
Chicago	LOCATION	loving the old literature , discerning and proving that which is new , and laying the foundations for that which is to come , a
Chicago	LOCATION	which is destined to become the centre of American literature in the future .

		I remain , dear sir , your obedient servant ,
WALTER BESANT	PERSON	.

		It embodies not alone the cream of all that has been published on the subject , but also much of the unpublished results of late research which the author has gleaned through correspondence with the foremost Oriental scholars of

		98 A NEWSPAPER SYMPOSIUM .

		A group of articles upon the subject of
American Journalism	ORGANIZATION	, published in the
August	DATE	`` Forum , '' offers no little food for reflection .

		The continuous degradation of the American newspaper has long been admitted by all who are competent to express an opinion upon the subject ; it would be difficult to-day to find an intelligent and disinterested observer who would make , otherwise than as a hypocritical pre - tence , the claim that our average newspaper is in any sense a leader of public opinion .

		Even those who , engaged in the '' new journalism , ' 7 attempt its defence , are growing bold enough to cast off the mask , and cynically to disavow all aims not comprised within such terms as . ''

		popularity , '' '' commercial success , '' and '' un - precedented circulation . ''

		Most of them are frank enough to admit that these considera - tions are the only ones to be seriously taken into account , and that the work of newspaper production is , like the work of the dealer in real-estate or of the stock-broker , essentially a form of money-getting .

		The fact is , of course , as all persons will ad - mit whose moral perceptions are not hopelessly blunted , that the profession of the journalist carries with it certain inseparable responsibil - ities , and that to ignore these responsibilities , or to take refuge behind the fact that the law -LRB- that excellent but necessarily imperfect rule of conduct -RRB- does not enforce them , is simply to set morality at defiance .

		In all occupations , indeed , there are ethical as well as legal limi - tations upon freedom of action ; but in the professions -LRB- and journalism surely ought to be numbered among them -RRB- the limitations im - posed by ethics are peculiarly obvious and im - perative .

		The aims of the newspaper , from the ethical standpoint , may for convenience be classified under three heads : 1 .

		As a collector of news , pure and simple , its work should be done in the scientific spirit , placing accuracy of statement above all other considerations .

		2 .

		In its selection and arrangement of the news thus collected , it should have regard to real rather than sensational values ; it should pre - sent its facts in their proper perspective -LRB- which is still , of course , a very different perspective from that required by permanent history -RRB- ; and it should carefully exclude , or at least mini - mize to the utmost , those facts which it can not possibly benefit the public to know , or of which the knowledge is likely to vulgarize popular taste and lower popular standards of morality .

		3 .

		In its comment upon the happenings of the day or the week , it is bound to be honest , to stand for well-defined principles , to express the sincere convictions of its intellectual head and of those associated with him in the work .

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, Judged by these tests -LRB- and who , without abandoning the ethical standpoint altogether , will deny their fairness ? -RRB-

		, there are few news - papers in the country that will not be found wanting .

		In fact , no serious attempt is likely to be made to defend the American newspaper upon any such grounds as we have presented .

		The '' practical newspaper man '' will answer them , and probably think the reply convincing , in some such fashion as follows : Of the first requirement he will say that an inaccurate and distorted report of an occurrence is better than no report at all ; that the public must , in any event , be given something to read upon the subject .

		Of the second requirement he will say that the public must be regaled with read - ing to its taste , no matter how trivial , how shocking , or how filthy the subject-matter .

		Of the third requirement he will probably say that the exigencies of partisan journalism are incompatible with sincerity and consistency ; or he may be content with the brutal cynicism of the statement that a newspaper proprietor may do what he wishes with his own , making it a weathercock to the shifting winds of ig - norant popular opinion or of personal whim making it even the instrument of his personal prejudices and petty malignities .

		Such a reply as the above , of course , begs the ethical question altogether , and leaves the discussion where it started .

		The magazine symposium to which we have referred in our caption includes among its contributors the ed - itor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' who derides at the outset the notion that newspapers should be conducted with any reference to ethical standards .

		Yet what would the editor of the '' Times '' think of the clergyman who should preach a doctrine carefully selected for its pay - ing qualities , or even of the physician who should take up with what he knew to be quack - ery because he expected from it large financial returns ?

		The newspaper certainly assumes , in its editorial department , the functions of the preacher or of the college professor in a social sense , even the functions of the medical practitioner ; is there any reason why it should be exempt from judgment by the same stand - ards ?

		Yet this is the simple proposition of which the writer in question makes elephantine fun . ''

		Among the mass of newspaper readers , '' he says , '' I do not find any warrant for the assertions made with such flippancy by these reckless critics that newspapers are everywhere regarded as untrustworthy and debasing . ''

		Of course not ! ''

		The mass of newspaper read - ers '' approve of the paper so carefully ad - justed to their tastes , just as the patients of our practitioner of the '' new medicine '' or the hearers of our preacher of the '' new theology '' approve of the quackery of which they are the willing dupes .

		It is the sort of thing they like , and so , with admirable thoughtfulness , it is provided for their delectation .

		All that is said by the writer just quoted , beyond the dull trifling that makes up a large part of his article , is reducible to what we may call , for brevity , the counting-room argument ; and the force of that argument we admit with - out cavil .

		If journalism is to be considered a form of business , and nothing more , then the only proper tests of success are the daily cir - culation , the number of advertisements , and the annual balance-sheet .

		Those who consider it a profession , with inherent , peculiar , and far-reaching responsibilities , will prefer the tests that we have already designated , and will be aided in applying them by the two articles , hitherto unmentioned , of the symposium that suggested our present comment .

		One of these articles , by a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper writer fo thirteen years ' experience , has for its title `` Journalism as a Career , '' and offers a very plain-spoken statement of the conditions of newspaper work in our largest city . ''

		The fundamental principle of metropolitan journal - ism , '' says this candid writer , '' is to buy white paper at
three cents	MONEY	a pound and sell it at
ten cents	MONEY	a pound .

		And in some quarters it does not matter how much the virgin whiteness of the paper is defiled so long as the defilement sells the paper . ''

		The writer is not so much concerned with what he casually calls the '' per - verted ethics '' of modern journalism he seems to take them for granted as with the life of the newspaper worker .

		That life , under mod - ern conditions , is one that a dog would hardly envy , so degrading is it , in most cases , to every form of self-respect .

		The modern newspaper owner is described in a few pointed sentences : '' He knows how to buy and sell , whether it be white paper or ink or brains .

		The fact that he may not know the first rudiments of the En - glish language , that sociology and political sci - ence are as incomprehensible to him as the hereafter , does not affect the case at all . '' ''

		Editorial writers , or critics , or copy-readers , or reporters , are so numerous and so cheap that his whole editorial staff can be changed in a day if he deems it necessary .

		He despises the literary accomplishments of these men and therefore the men themselves , because he meas -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 ures all men by their ability to accumulate money and can not see advantage in anything not convertible into money . ''

		Work in the employ of such a person is necessarily debasing ; and we are glad that one of the workers has had the candor to speak his mind openly , and give us this truthful account of the humiliation at - tendant upon the path of the modern journal - ist , of the meanness , the sycophancy , and the intellectual dishonesty that are the chief qual - ifications for his success , and of the peculiar brutality that marks the attitude maintained toward him by his employer .

		The writer of the third of our series of arti - cles , also a journalist of long experience , boldly attacks the modern newspaper at the point where its defence is commonly supposed to be the strongest , and asks whether , with all its defects of prejudice and taste , it even succeeds in giving the news .

		The writer selects for comparison , taking the date at random , a copy of each of the four leading
New York	LOCATION	papers for
Sunday	DATE	,
April 17 , 1881	DATE	, and copies of the same papers for the corresponding date of the present year .

		He analyzes and classifies their contents , and presents the result in neatly tab - ulated form .

		While the aggregate reading matter in the four papers for
1893	DATE	is about treble that in the papers twelve years old , it is noticeable that the amount of space devoted to art has fallen from six and a quarter to five and a quarter columns ; that religious mat - ter has declined from four and a quarter col - umns to half a column -LRB- in the
Sunday	DATE	papers at that ! -RRB-

		; and that literature has dropped from forty columns to twenty-five .

		When we ask what has taken the place of the space thus saved , and what fills the two hundred per cent of additional space , we are answered by the figures for scandals , sports , and gossip .

		Scan - dals have gone up from one column to seven and a half ; sports from seven columns to fifty ; and gossip from four and a half columns to one hundred and sixteen .

		The writer 's final comment upon these astonishing figures is thus expressed : '' There is a conventional phrase * a newspaper is the history of the world for a day ' that is more or less believed in .

		Noth - ing could be falser than this .

		Our newspapers do not record the really serious happenings , but only the sensations , the catastrophes of history . ''

		One other point made by the writer of the last-mentioned article demands our attention .

		In comparing the newspapers of
New York	LOCATION	with those of
Chicago	LOCATION	, he distinctly declares for the superior tone and intelligence ofj -LSB- the latter .

		While the former have been under - going the deterioration set forth by his con - vincing statistics , the latter `` have distinctly improved in a better direction . ''

		This approval is , of course , only relative , and implies no claim that '' the
Chicago	LOCATION	papers are models of pro- priety and good taste . ''

		On the contrary , we are told , '' they are not even so good as the
New York	LOCATION	papers of twelve years ago ; but they are very much nicer and cleaner than the
Chicago	LOCATION	papers of that time or than the
New York	LOCATION	papers of to-day .

		So , while there has been a distinct deterioration and decadence in the
New York	LOCATION	newspaper press in the last dozen years , the improvement in
Chicago	LOCATION	has been steady and noteworthy , and this notwith - standing the introduction and general adoption there of the illustrations that do not illustrate . ''

		We are inclined to think that the approval thus expressed and thus carefully qualified is just , and it is noteworthy as the opinion of a
New York	LOCATION	journalist .

		Still more noteworthy , perhaps , is the endorsement of this opinion by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		This opinion , says the '' Post , '' '' we have independent evi - dence to believe to be well taken .

		That is , that while
New York	LOCATION	papers have degenerated , Western papers , particularly
Chicago	LOCATION	papers , have improved . ''

		The man who , more than any other , is responsible for the '' new journal - ism `` as it exists in
New York	LOCATION	was a West - erner who `` brought to
New York	LOCATION	a vulgar standard which was then current and popular in the West , but which the West has since grown ashamed of and tried to improve . ''

		THE EDUCATION CONGRESSES .

		To the Education Congresses of the World 's Con - gress Auxiliary were assigned the two weeks be - ginning
July 17	DATE	.

		The Congresses of the second week were held under the special auspices of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, but their work , in many of the departments , simply continued the work of the first week , bringing to it the re - enforcement of new speakers , and , to a certain ex - tent , of new special subjects for discussion .

		The work of the first week was organized in thirteen sections , and that of the second in fifteen .

		With fifteen distinct sections in session at the same time , as was the case during the second week , the indi - vidual participant found himself in a state border - ing upon distraction .

		He might easily eliminate from the problem a few sessions of the more spe - cial sort , but there still remained a considerable number having nearly or quite equal claims upon his attention .

		The same complication has made it 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, impossible for us to present a full report -LRB- even had space permitted -RRB- of the proceedings of the Con - gresses ; our readers must be content with an ac - count of what took place at the more important of them , and , in some cases , with a list of the more distinguished speakers , and the subjects of their re - marks .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on the subject of
General Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion held eleven sessions during the two weeks , all but the last three being planned by a committee having Mrs.
H. M. Wilmarth	PERSON	as chairman .

		The subjects under discussion the first week included the following : '' Reforms Now Practicable in
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ondary Education , '' '' Methods of Teaching Ethics in Schools , '' '' The Education of Girls , '' and the condition of education in a number of foreign coun - tries ,
Australia	LOCATION	,
Iceland	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	.


Monday , July 24	DATE	, brought two very interesting sessions of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the first of them being given over to a discussion of what the public schools ought to teach .

		Among the speakers on this subject were Mrs.
Marion Foster Washburne	PERSON	, who made a plea for the kindergarten ; Colonel
Francis W. Parker	PERSON	, who stoutly defended the scientific educational methods called '' fads '' by the ignorant and indif - ferent ; Mr.
Thomas Morgan	PERSON	, who infused an ele - ment of socialism into the discussion ; and Dr.
C. M. Woodward	PERSON	, who argued for manual training .

		The second of these sessions brought more social - ism with Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, philosophy with the paper sent by Mr.
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, and practi - cality with General
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	, whose ad - dress was the feature of the occasion .

		The session of
July 25	DATE	discussed Herbartian pedagogics from many points of view , the speakers including Dr.
Levi Seeley	PERSON	, of
Lake Forest University	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Elmer E. Brown	PERSON	, of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	, President
Charles De Garmo	PERSON	, of Swarthmore Col - lege , and Superintendent
C. B. Gilbert	PERSON	, of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	.

		The closing three sessions of this
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	included addresses by
Bishop Samuel Fal	ORGANIZATION	- lows , Dr.
S. H. Peabody	PERSON	, Superintendent
Albert G. Lane	PERSON	, President
W. R. Harper	PERSON	, President
James B. Angell	PERSON	, General
John Eaton	PERSON	, Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	,
Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION
G. W. Ross	PERSON	of To - ronto , MM .

		G. Compayre ' and
Benjamin Buisson	PERSON	, Professor
Stephan Watzoldt	PERSON	,
Prince Wolkonsky	PERSON	, Professor
Dimscha	PERSON	and
M. Kovalevsky	PERSON	, Russian delegates , and a number of others .

		Two Congresses on the subject of Psychology were included in the proceedings of the second week .

		One of them , having for its special subject
Experimental Psychology in Education	ORGANIZATION	, was organ - ized and presided over by President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, of
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	, and held three sessions , devoting its entire time to the psychology of the child .

		The reasons for this limitation of field were thus set forth by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	: '' It has been decided , after much consideration and wide conference , to devote the entire three days to the subject of child study .

		Within a very few years several societies have been formed for this purpose ; several jour - nals have been started ; the school children in many cities of this country and
Europe	LOCATION	have been meas - ured or tested as to the rate of growth of body and muscular and mental power ; various classes of de - fect of sense , limb , mind , character , form of error in school work and of ignorance on entering school , have been tabulated .

		From these results a new body of literature is being developed , which throws much light upon the controllable causes , whether of excellence or defect , and contains many suggestions on the method and matter of teaching , and prom - ises to show how instruction can be made more ef - fective , as well as to point out the true beginnings of instruction , in the entire group of psychological subjects . ''

		Papers were presented by President Hail r Professors
G. T. W. Patrick	PERSON	,
Earl Barnes	PERSON	,
W. L. Bryan	PERSON	, and others .

		Rational Psychology in
Edu	LOCATION	- cation was the subject of the other
Congress of Psychologists	ORGANIZATION	, and was presided over by the vener - able Dr.
James McCosh	PERSON	, whose active participation in the proceedings gave them a peculiar interest .

		Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	read the opening paper at the first of the three sessions , taking for his subject , '' Reality : What Place Has It in Philosophy ? ''

		The second paper , sent by Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, discussed the dependence of psychology upon physiology .

		The reading of this paper was followed by an interest - ing discussion , in which Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	and Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	took leading parts .

		At the other ses - sions , papers were read by President
Schurman	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
A. F. Hewitt	PERSON	, of the Cath - olic
University of America	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
G. T. Or	PERSON	- mond , of
Princeton	LOCATION	, and Professor Titchener , of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Congress on Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	held nine ses - sions during the two weeks ; the first six of which ses - sions were organized by a committee headed by Pres - ident
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, and Mrs.
H. C. Brainard	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first session of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was opened , after the preliminary addresses of welcome , by President
Angell	PERSON	, of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, who read a paper on '' State Universities in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Another paper of interest was by
Miss E. P. Hughes	PERSON	, Principal of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
England	LOCATION	-RRB- Training College , on '' The
Training of University Graduates	ORGANIZATION	for the Profession of Teaching . ''

		The proceedings of the day following were devoted to education in

		The four papers first mentioned in this list were , perhaps , the most important , or at least aroused the most evident interest .

		On
Monday , July 24	DATE	, a number of papers of the highest importance were read .

		Those particularly deserving of mention are '' The Latest Revival of the Study of Politics , '' by Professor
Bernard Moses	PERSON	, of the
University of Cal	ORGANIZATION	- ifornia ; '' Graduate Work in

F. E. Woodruff	PERSON	, of
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The programme of this day 's proceedings also included an address by Dr.
Keane	PERSON	, Chancellor of the
Catholic University of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		The discussion of Higher Education was con - tinued , under the auspices of the
National Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tional
Association	ORGANIZATION	, during three highly interesting sessions held on the mornings of
July 26	DATE	, 27 , and 28 .

		Professor
A. F. West	PERSON	, of
Princeton Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , acted as secretary of these meetings , and the presiding officers were Presidents
Gilman	PERSON	,
Angell	PERSON	, and
Patton	PERSON	.

		Discussions rather than set papers were the rule at these sessions .

		At the first session , the subjects up for consideration were these : How far is it desirable that universities should be of one type ?

		How should we cope with the problem of ex - cessive specialization in university study ?

		To what extent should an antecedent liberal education be required of students of law , medicine , and theology ?

		In what way may professional schools be most advan - tageously connected with universities and colleges ?

		The first of these discussions was opened by Presi - dent
Kellogg	PERSON	, of the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, and the last by President Low , of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		A paper sent by Professor
Allievo	PERSON	, of the
University of Turin	ORGANIZATION	, opened the second , while the third , which proved the most interesting of all , was opened by Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, who made a strong plea for the `` antecedent liberal education '' in all cases .

		The session of the second day brought the interest of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to its climax .

		The special question for discussion was the use to be made by colleges of the Arts degree whether it should continue to stand , as heretofore , for the distinct type of humanistic culture produced by the study of Greek and Latin , or whether it should be con - verted into an '' omnibus '' degree to be conferred upon graduates in all departments .

		Professor
Hale	PERSON	opened this discussion with a carefully prepared and logical argument for the former contention , to which President
Jordan	PERSON	, of the
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, made an able but somewhat inconclusive reply .

		Pro- fessor
Shorey	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, then took the platform , and made a singularly effective plea for the retention of what has always been , un - til recently , the accepted meaning of the Arts de - gree .

		The trenchant way in which the speaker cleared the whole discussion of the irrelevancies that are always creeping into it and obscuring the real points at issue was particularly satisfying .

		Another argument for the '' omnibus '' degree , by Professor
T. C. Chamberlain	PERSON	, of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, closed the discussion of this subject .

		Another subject coming up at the same session was that of the conditions of undergraduate life at the present day as compared with the conditions a gen - eration ago , the discussion to range , as the pro- gramme announced , `` over the topics of athletics , morals , student organizations , intercollegiate cour - tesies , and relations of students to instructors . ''

		President
Raymond	PERSON	, of
Wesleyan University	ORGANIZATION	, led in this discussion , and took a very optimistic view of the situation .

		In the comment that followed , a sharp divergence of opinion was manifest , espe - cially as to the influence of college athletics .

		The Rev. Mr.
Payne	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, was especially vig - orous in his denunciation of the evils attendant upon them , and his view of the matter , although extreme , had considerable support from other speakers .

		The closing session of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had for its general theme '' the relations of higher education to the advancement of culture , learning , and civil - ization . ''

		Professor West read a paper on '' The Evolution of Liberal Education '' ; this was followed by a discussion of the doctorate in philosophy and of the conditions under which it should be bestowed , and the session closed with addresses by Bishop
Keane	PERSON	and President
Angell	PERSON	on the relation of our colleges to the advancement of civilization .

		When we consider the intelligent character of the audi - ences , the number of distinguished educators par - ticipating , and the excellence of the addresses made , we must reckon this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on the
Higher Edu	ORGANIZATION	- cation as one of the most marked successes of the Auxiliary scheme .

		The
University Extension Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in charge of a committee having as chairman Professor Na - thaniel
Butler	PERSON	, Jr. , of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, held five sessions , all included within the first week .

		The first paper read was one sent by Professor
James Stuart	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	.

		It gave a sketch of Uni - versity Extension in
England	LOCATION	, and was particularly interesting as coming from the man who , in
1872	DATE	, really started the movement .

		Of the other papers , those of especial interest and value were : `` A Sketch of the Movement in
America	LOCATION	, '' by Miss Katharine 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, L. Sharp ; Dr.
R. D. Roberts	PERSON	's paper on '' Univer - sity Credits '' ; Mr.
F. W. Shepardson	PERSON	's paper on '' The Traveling Library '' ; Mr.
E. T. Devine	PERSON	's pa - per on '' The Syllabus '' ; Mr.
George L. Hunter	PERSON	's paper upon '' The Function of the Local Centre '' ; the addresses by Mrs.
Charles Kendall Adams	PERSON	and Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Charles Zeublin	PERSON	gave a very forcible and practical discussion of '' Class Instruction as a
Department of University Exten	ORGANIZATION	- sion , '' and Mr.
E. L. S. Horsburgh	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, gave what was perhaps the strongest and most interest - ing paper of the entire programme , the paper which really closed the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, discussing '' The Uni - versities and the Workingmen . ''

		The spirit in which he discussed it and the sentiment which he expressed were an interesting proof that the pro- gressive Englishman of to-day , even though he may come from
Oxford	LOCATION	itself , is quite as democratic as the educated and enlightened American .

		The chairman of the committee writes to us upon the work of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as follows : '' The recently closed
Congress	ORGANIZATION	did not accomplish the very high - est ideals of success , but I think it came as near to that as any of the Congresses that have thus far been held .

		I feel that we could do much better if we had the thing to do a second time .

		There were many representatives of foreign countries in which the movement has begun in one form or another , who would have been glad to report the condition of work in their countries , but for that the time could not be found .

		I think we had rather too much read - ing of papers , with too little time for discussion .

		But , on the whole , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was very gratify - ing , and I am sure that it put the movement of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	in a new light before a great many intelligent people who will carry back to their communities new ideas regarding this new instru - mentality of culture .

		I know of several commun - ities in neighboring States , in which undoubtedly the work will be begun the coming fall and winter merely because their representatives were present at our Congresses . ''

		Mr.
Charles Zeublin	PERSON	, of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , and Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, of
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	, un - dertook the organization of a
Congress on Social Settlements	ORGANIZATION	, and of this .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	seven sessions were held during the first week .

		Among the pa - pers read we may mention : '' The University Set - tlement Historically Considered , '' by Mr.
Robert A. Woods	PERSON	, of
Andover House	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	; '' The Re - lation of the Settlement to Universities , '' by Mr.
James B. Reynolds	PERSON	, of
Paris	LOCATION	; '' The Settlement as a Centre for
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
R. D. Roberts	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	; '' The Settlement in Its Re - lation to Municipal Reform , '' by Mrs.
Florence Kelley	PERSON	; '' The Settlement in Its Relation to
Tene	PERSON	- ment Houses , '' by
Miss Helena Dudley	PERSON	, of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia ; '' The Settlement in Its Relation to Or - ganized Social Work , '' by Mr.
Everett P. Wheeler	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	; `` Weak Points in the Settlement Method , '' by Mr.
Edward Cummings	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	; '' The Settlement in Its Relation to the Art Movement , '' by Miss
Ellen G. Starr	PERSON	, of
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	; and `` The Ideals of Future Society as Evolved in a Settlement , '' by Mr.
Charles Zeublin	PERSON	.

		The evening Symposium on '' The Settlement in Its Relation to the
Labor Movement	ORGANIZATION	, '' opened by Mr.
Henry D. Lloyd	PERSON	, was perhaps the most inter - esting of the sessions of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Congresses of Secondary and Elementary Education	ORGANIZATION	were held during the second week , and had three sessions each .

		In the former , the prin - cipal subjects of discussion related to the arrange - ment of the school curriculum , although the inaug - ural address , by Dr.
J. C. Mackenzie	PERSON	, had for its subject the supervision of secondary instruction by
State	ORGANIZATION	or municipal authority .

		In the latter Con - gress , the course of study occupied the first session , the teaching of geography the second , and moral education the third .

		The geography session , hav - ing the most specific theme , proved the most suc - cessful , and was provided with an interesting ap - pendix in the shape of an address by General
A. W. Greeley	PERSON	, on the subject of '' Arctic Explora - tions . ''

		The
Congress on Technological Instruction	ORGANIZATION	held three sessions , and was opened by General
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech	ORGANIZATION	- nology .

		The first session considered the thesis : '' How far do the technological schools , as they are at present organized , accomplish the training of men for the scientific professions , and how far and for what reasons do they fail to accomplish their pri - mary purpose ? ''

		The other sessions discussed the educational value of a number of special technolog - ical studies , such as chemistry , electricity , and draw - ing .

		The
Congress on Manual Education	ORGANIZATION	, which extended through the two weeks , had no less than eleven sessions , and the papers read were of a high character .

		Among them we may mention : '' The Function of Drawing and
Manual Training	ORGANIZATION	in
Edu	LOCATION	- cation , '' by Professor
C. R. Richards	PERSON	, of the
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	; '' Manual '' Training in the American School System , '' by President
Walter Hervey	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	Training College ; '' The Ethical Value of Manual Training , '' by Dr.
Emil G. Hirsch	PERSON	; '' Manual Training in
Sweden	LOCATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
Gustaf Sellergren	PERSON	, of the
Stockholm Techno	ORGANIZATION	- logical High School ; '' The Influence of Japanese Art , '' by Professor
Ernest Fenollosa	PERSON	, of the
Boston	LOCATION	Art Museum ; The Philosophy of the Tool , '' by Dr.
Paul Cams	PERSON	; '' Manual and Art Education in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Edward Boos-Jegher	PERSON	, official delegate of the Swiss Confederation ; and the ad - dresses by Mr.
W. M. R. French	PERSON	, Dr.
H. H. Bel	PERSON	- field , chairman of the committee of organization , Dr.
C. M. Woodward	PERSON	, of
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Gabriel Bamberger	PERSON	, the Rev.
F. W. Gun	PERSON	- saulus , Professor
Halsey S. Ives	PERSON	, Dr.
W. T. Har	PERSON	- ris , and the Rev.
Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	.

		The papers and addresses above mentioned came during the first week ; the second was mainly devoted to the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 discussion of certain theses , previously selected and announced , such as : '' The new demands which the world 's industries make upon the elementary schools , '' `` The claims of the two systems of man - ual training known as the Russian and the Swedish , '' and '' Since all industrial products involve form , it follows that all industrial instruction should have an aesthetic basis in the study of the general prin - ciples which underlie all tasteful and graceful forms , and this study should be regarded and ranked as of equal educational value with the mechanic art pro- cesses . ''

		The limits of our space forbid any account of the proceedings of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Art Instruction , in three sessions ; the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Instruction in
Vocal Music	ORGANIZATION	, likewise in three sessions ; the Con - gress on
Kindergarten Education	ORGANIZATION	, in thirteen ses - sions ; of the three joint sessions of the
Kindergarten and Manual Training Congresses	ORGANIZATION	; or of the Con - gresses on School Supervision and the
Professional Training of Teachers	ORGANIZATION	, in three sessions each .

		And there are something like a dozen of the Education Congresses that we can not even mention by name . ''

		All are but parts of one stupendous whole . ''

		Of how stupendous was that whole our account may convey a certain , although a necessarily imperfect , idea .

		Perhaps the following sentences , quoted from an article by Mr.
A. Tolman Smith	PERSON	, of the
United States Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, may serve us as well as anything for a closing comment : '' On the hu - manity side this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is an assurance such as the world has never before received that the human family is one in the aspirations and the necessities of its spiritual being .

		On the professional side the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has sounded the note of a victory over the downfall and routing of two fetishes long wor - shipped in our schools : the fetish of uniform work at a uniform pace for all children , and the deadly superstition that teaching is a matter of fixed method which can be drilled into insensate minds .

		BREACH OF IDIOM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a foot-note to p. 85 of '' Modern English , '' I call attention to a slip on the part of Mr.
G. P. Marsh	PERSON	, where he writes : `` The word respect , in this combination , has none of the meanings known to -LSB- sic -RSB- it , as an independent noun , in the English vocabulary . ''

		Mr.
R. O. Williams	PERSON	, in your issue for
July 1	DATE	, con - tends that Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	there delivers himself metonym - ically .

		But , if he so delivers himself , for what is '' word '' exchangeable ?

		Its exchangeableuess failing , '' the mean - ings known to it , '' if acceptable , necessitates the accept - ance of '' the known meanings to it '' ; '' to it '' being for of it .

		Since , in correct usage , known to is practically equiv - alent to known by , the conversion of Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	's pas - sive construction into the active yields : '' The word respect , in this combination , has none of the meanings which it knows , as an independent noun , in the En - glish vocabulary . ''

		To say that a meaning '' is known to '' or '' is known by '' a word , instead of '' is recognized as borne by '' it , just like saying that a word '' knows '' a meaning , for '' has '' it , at best involves , it seems to me , a highly nebulous and intolerable sort of personification .

		We are by no means obliged , however , to conclude that Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	ventured to sanction the novel phenom - enon of a word 's '' knowing '' a meaning , whether as an intimate , as a casual acquaintance , or as tantum visum .

		The question of what he actually did , I shall come to a little farther on .

		In order to be fully intelligible , I repeat my foot - note above referred to : '' A
Lord Grenville	PERSON	of former days wrote of ' a long and de - structive warfare , of a nature long since unknown to the prac - tice of civilized nations . '

		Here , remarks
Coleridge	PERSON	, ' the word to is absurdly used for the word in . '

		-LRB- ' Essays on His Own Times , ' p. 202 . -RRB-

		Not unlike the nobleman 's ` unknown to , ' the context considered is Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	's ' known to . ' ''

		Lord
Grenville	PERSON	was far from intending to say , though in effect he says , that , as concerns a certain '' long and de - structive warfare , the practice of civilized nations was , in the distant past , ignorant of its nature . ''

		For
Coleridge	PERSON	, if he had altered more freely , must have proposed to sub - stitute , in place of '' unknown to , '' '' discarded in '' ;
Lord Grenville	PERSON	's nobiliary rhetoric , unamended , importing that the kind of warfare which he disapproves of was not known in remote ages .

		Altogether apart from this , to predicate , respecting a practice , that it does not '' know '' this or that , is , I ad - mit , a metonomy , in which '' practice '' stands for '' those who practise . ''

		But a metonomy thus violent , permis - sible though it may be in poetry , is , to my mind , quite out of place in plain pedestrian prose .

		That , however ,
Lord Grenville	PERSON	indulged in it I see no reason for be - lieving .

		Coleridge condemned his '' to '' only for in ; and '' not unlike it , the context considered , '' as I have said , is the '' to '' which Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	puts for of .

		All this becomes clear by rewriting , with inversions , the passages quoted .

		Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	, in doing as he does , exemplifies the care - lessness in the employment of indeclinables which not - ably distinguishes our countrymen in general .

		Of this carelessness , a few illustrations , exhibiting to misused for a variety of prepositions , here follow : '' The horse ... had a very disdainful fling to his hind legs . ''

		In all these quotations there is violation of idiom .

		To allege , against my position relative to their `` to , '' such phrases as '' there are three sides to a triangle , '' ''
Albany	LOCATION	lies to the north of
New York	LOCATION	, '' '' it serves as a protection to the throat , '' etc. , etc. , or quaintnesses like '' we have
Abraham	PERSON	to our father , '' '' he was son to a butcher , '' is no argument .

		Good contemporary usage , not analogy , determines what is idiomatic ; and accord - ingly , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's '' a half-dozen of them , '' in his letter before me , and his '' did not have , '' in '' Our Dic - tionaries , '' p. 107 , can not be permitted to pass muster . ''

		Has F. H. ' ever erred ? ''

		So inquires Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liams , humorously ; and he shall have an answer to his inquiry from the very highest authority , an answer which he may , with all confidence , enroll among the placita prudentum .

		Alas !

		much too favorable dear sir , often , and far oftener than often , in the course of his philological peregrinations , has that eminent oracle , for want of unction with the oil of inerrancy , gone wholly and disastrously astray , nay , come to utter and irrecov - erable grief , precisely after the fashion of the most or - dinary lost sheep of the commonest fold .

		But , for all that , it chances , curiously enough , that , in nearly all cases where he has been charged with taking the wrong road , he has had the good fortune to take the right one ; and this he may some day show in detail , at the same time making a full and contrite confession of his mani - fold and multifarious shortcomings .

		Resuming the first person , he would be allowed , meanwhile , to advert to one of his most recent miscarriages , in the matter of expression , and to explain how it came about .

		It was in the
London	LOCATION	'' Academy , '' in a letter which , by the way , I have to thank THE DIAL for noticing gra - ciously , that I stumbled and fell .

		The beginning of that letter runs : `` This question , it may be confidently assumed , is one to which all , barring the grossly illiter - ate , would reply in the affirmative .

		Most of them , too , if asked , '' etc. .

		The proof-sheet had '' Most of us '' with '' we , '' '' our , '' and '' we should , '' in what immediately follows , instead of `` they , '' `` their , '' and '' they would . ''

		Revising , in unavoidable haste , I altered , in '' Most of MS , '' only the '' us , '' not observing that I had thereby as good as blundered into the tautological '' Most of all , '' for '' most . ''

		For the rest , on discovery of the remark - able genius who is not liable , when working against time , to such a mishap as that of mine , I should be glad to secure him , if possible , as my literarian

		or in what it expresses ?

		I am at a loss to know .

		THE USE AND ABUSE OF SLANG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The paper by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, in a re - cent number of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly Magazine , '' on '' The Function of Slang , '' fills , as the advertisements say , a long-felt want .

		Every true philologist , in these latter days , must have wished for some one bold enough to dispute the old pedagogic theory that slang is invariably a linguistic crime .

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's literary inde - pendence and alert modernity signally qualify him to set up the new standard ; and yet his manifesto might , I conceive , have been considerably improved by the omis - sion of a few inaccuracies and a correction in point of view .

		He says , for instance , that the vulgar phrase '' fire out , '' in the sense of expel forcibly , was used by Shake - speare , and quotes in support from one of the sonnets : '' Till my good angel fire my bad one out . ''

		Here , obviously , the '' fire out '' means , not expel forcibly , as Professor
Matthews	PERSON	, curiously enough , seems to have thought , but drive away by fire .

		In '' Lear '' we have the same figure : '' He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes . ''

		-LRB-
Lear	PERSON	, v , 3 ; 22 , -RCB- The power and poetic propriety of this figure must be felt at once .

		In
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's use of the term ,
Adam	PERSON	and Eve may be said to have been '' fired out '' of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	; yet we should hardly like to say so of them nowadays , simply because the modern metaphor is that of fire - arms , not of a fire-brand .

		Of the two , I think no one will hesitate to pronounce
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's the better .

		He was not seldom extravagant in his tropes , but it re - mained for the exuberant incongruity of the nineteenth century to speak of '' firing '' people from the cannon 's mouth .

		In circuses , to be sure , we have all seen lovely pink-apparelled creatures who were literally '' fired out , '' who described graceful parabolas through the air , landed safely in capacious nets , and made unsteady exits with bows and kisses of the hand .

		But when we talk about '' firing '' a book agent from an office room , nine in ten of us have dulled our use of the words by forgetting what they originally meant .

		It is this same heedless lack of imagination that is the besetting sin of much of the popular diction of to - day , a sin which Professor
Matthews	PERSON	fails to rebuke as I could wish a person of his authority to have done .

		He says , '' It can not be declared too often and too em - phatically how fortunate it is that the care of our lan - guage is not in the hands of even the most competent of our scholars . ''

		Our scholars and our purists exert a corrective influence which these rapid days make us hardly able to do without .

		In slower times a new word or a new phrase was not caught at once upon the cur - rent of popular approval ; it was revolved first in the sober eddies of scholastic deliberation , with the result that much rubbish was got rid of by the way .

		We hardly agree with Professor
Matthews	PERSON	that this rubbish should be swept along undammed .

		And we should be inclined to dispute him utterly , if by '' the most compe - tent of our scholars '' he included
Lowell	PERSON	,
Emerson	PERSON	, and men of their calibre .

		A language with the like of them for overseers would never be in danger of growing for - mal , and could not tend seriously toward the license which Professor
Matthews	PERSON	rather too cursorily deprecates .

		He should recall
Emerson	PERSON	's American Scholar for breadth and scholastic equity .

		And his admired
Lowell	PERSON	might have kept him from such an error as implying that deck , in the sense of a pack of cards , is slang , '' Western , '' Professor
Matthews	PERSON	says , not , perhaps , hav - ing known always that it is an old word .

		If the men of books had a little more to say in this matter , they would not let good words come into disrepute because they fell into bad company , and there would be less necessity for the coinage of new ones .

		GEOIIG
EBERS	ORGANIZATION	'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* The proverbial rarity of true '' Confessions '' is not so surprising when we consider how hard it is to shrive one 's self , without evasion or casuistry , even at the bar of one 's own con - science .

		Perfectly sincere autobiographies are the black swans of literature .

		Even
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	, the accepted type of autobiographical candor , never meant to be candid .

		He care - fully screened himself from observation -LRB- as he thought -RRB- behind his cipher ; and posterity has taken what is , on the whole , rather an unfair advantage of him .

		Pepys was really a sensible , self-respecting man , and not unmindful of
Lord Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's maxims as to the
Graces	LOCATION	; and were it possible for him at any time to revisit the glimpses of the moon , his dismay at the qual - ity of his reception would be comical indeed .

		In the little volume before us , '' The Story of My Life , '' by Dr.
Georg Ebers	PERSON	the eminent Egyptologist and novelist , the point beyond which autobiographical frankness ceases , in a way , to be a virtue is fairly indicated .

		The book gives us all that its title warrants us in asking , and it does not give us too much .

		Its most important heads are the touching retro - spect of the author 's childhood , the account of his gymnasium and university career and of his early essays in authorship , and the description of the unique Keilhau school -LRB- founded by Frce - bel -RRB- , its methods and ideals .

		There is a good deal of incidental portraiture and reminiscence , and certain not unimportant Pendennis-like episodes of the narrator 's Flegeljahre are amus - ingly told .

		The style throughout is easy and familiar , and there is a certain engaging air , especially in the earlier chapters , of musing , half-soliloquy , that the rather hasty translation has not altogether effaced .


Georg Ebers	PERSON	was born in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1837	DATE	.

		He was a posthumous child . ''

		It was , '' he says , '' To soothe a mother 's heartbreak that I came in the saddest hours of her life , and , though my locks are now gray , I have uot forgotten the joyful moments in which that dear mother hugged her fatherless little one , and among other pet names called him her ' comfort child . ' ''

		The mother was a

Holland	LOCATION	; and that the title of '' the beautiful
Hollander	PERSON	, '' by which she became known in the capital , was worthily be - * THE STORY OF MY LIFE , from Childhood to Manhood .

		stowed is attested by the portrait which -LRB- in the fullest sense -RRB- adorns the volume before us .

		The plate is , in itself , a poor one ; but the beauty and goodness of the original shine through and fairly overcome the faults and in - adequacies of the representation .

		Says our author : '' No one could help pronouncing my mother beauti - ful ; but to me she was at once the fairest and best of women , and if I make the suffering
Stephanus	PERSON	in Homo Sum say , < For every child his own mother is the best mother , ' mine certainly was to me .

		My heart rejoiced when I perceived that every one shared this apprecia - tion . ''

		When the elder
Ebers	PERSON	led the `` beautiful Hollander '' away from her native city as his bride , the burgomaster told him that he gave to his keeping the pearl of
Rotterdam	LOCATION	; and that the phrase was not merely the language of compliment was evinced by the young wife 's speedy social triumph in her new home .

		She became one of the most courted women in Ber - lin society : ''
Holtei	PERSON	-LRB- the actor and dramatist -RRB- had made her ac - quaintance at this time , and it was a delight to hear her speak of those gay , brilliant days .

		How often
Baron von Humboldt	PERSON	,
Rauch	PERSON	, or
Schleiermacher	PERSON	had escorted her to dinner !

		Hegel had kept a blackened coin won from her at whist .

		Whenever he sat down to play cards with her he liked to draw it out , and showing it to his partner , say , ' My thaler , fair lady . ' ''

		Holtei , in later years , when asked by the au - thor if he remembered the '' fair lady , '' warmly replied : '' ... No , my young unknown friend , I have far too much with which to reproach myself , have brought from the conflicts of a changeful life a lacerated heart , but I have never reached the point where that heart ceased to cherish
Fanny Ebers	ORGANIZATION	among the most sacred memo - ries of my chequered career .

		How often her loved image appears before me when , in lonely twilight hours , I recall the past . ''

		Less eloquent was the tribute of
Frau Kom	PERSON	- missionsrath
Reichert	PERSON	, to whom
Madam Ebers	PERSON	, in the first year of her widowhood , applied for the lease of a house in the Thiergartenstrasse .

		This lady , having no children herself , inclined to be rather sharp with people who had ; so she refused the lease , adding that she pre - ferred to let the house '' stand empty rather than rent it to a family with children . ''

		But , says the author , '' She had a warm , kind heart , and she told me this ners elf the sight of the beautiful young mother in her deep mourning made her quickly forget her preju - dice . '

		If she had brought ten bawlers instead of five , ' she remarked , ' I would not have refused the house to that angel face . ' ''

		About this pleasant , retired house in the Thiergartenstrasse are twined some of the ten -
88	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, derest memories of the author 's childhood among them the regular pilgrimages to the churchyard where his father lay buried .

		At these little ceremonies all the children were re - quired to assist : '' During the walk , we gathered blue corn-flowers and scarlet poppies from the fields , bluebells , daisies , ranun - culus , and snap-dragon from the turf along the road - side , and tied them into nosegays for the graves .

		My mother moved silently with us between the rows of grassy mounds , tombstones , and crosses , while we carried the pots of flowers and wreaths , which , to afford everyone the pleasure of helping , she had distributed among us at the grave-digger 's house , just back of the cemetery .

		... My mother led the way into the small enclosure , which was surrounded by an iron railing , and prayed or thought silently of the beloved dead who rested there .

		... When she had satisfied the needs of her own soul , she turned to us , and with cheerful composure directed the decoration of the mound .

		Then she spoke of our father , and if any of us had recently incurred punish - ment one instance of this kind is indelibly impressed on my memory she passed her arms around the child , and in whispered words , which no one else could hear , entreated the son or daughter not to grieve her so again , but to remember the dead . ''

		Later , the family moved to the
Lennestrasse	LOCATION	, and at this period our author 's acquaintance with the world of books and of men fairly be - gan .

		The mother was still the sun about which the little lives revolved .

		She shared in and supervised the amusements of her children , and directed their reading with judicious liberality .


Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, the Arabian Nights ,
Don Quixote	PERSON	, Gulliver 's Travels , etc. , were devoured in turn ; but the ever-green story of the Trojan War was the common favorite : '' Homer 's heroes seemed like giant oaks , which far overtopped the little trees of the human wood .

		They towered like glorious snow-mountains above the little hills with which my childish imagination was already filled ; and how often we played the Trojan War , and aspired to the honor of acting Achilles , Hector , or Ajax . ''

		In the Lennestrasse our author was early introduced to the world of art , and enjoyed access to the neighboring studios of
Drake	LOCATION	,
Streichenberg	PERSON	, and
Peter Cornelius	PERSON	.

		Corne - lius was an especial friend ; and when he asked permission of
Madam Ebers	PERSON	to use her son 's blond curly head as a model , the mother readily consented .

		Of this memorable sitting the wri - ter , as he says , remembers nothing save some particularly good candied fruit which the artist found necessary to administer at intervals : '' Even now I smile at the recollection of his making an angel or a spirit of peace out of the wild boy who perhaps just before had been scuffling with the enemy from the flower-cellar . ''

		An equally notable friend at that time was
Court-Chaplain Strauss	PERSON	: '' When
Strauss	PERSON	met us in the street and called to us with a certain unction in his melodious voice , < Good morning my dear children in Christ ! '

		our hearts went out to him , and it seemed to us as if we had received a blessing . ''


Strauss	PERSON	was deep in the counsels of Freder - ick
William IV.	PERSON	, although that eccentric prince could not resist an inclination to make cheap jokes at the good man 's expense .

		After creating him court-chaplain ,
Frederick	PERSON	said to
Alexander	PERSON	von Humboldt : `` A trick in nat - ural history which you can not copy !

		I have turned an ostrich -LRB-
Strauss	PERSON	-RRB- into a bull-finch -LRB-
Dompfaffer	PERSON	-RCB- '' an allusion to
Strauss	PERSON	's be - ing a preacher in the cathedral -LRB- Dow -RRB- .

		It was to this jocular prince that von Hum - boldt , when asked how he , who passed at court for a freethinker , could go to church , made the apt reply , '' In order to get on , your Excel - lency . ''

		The scenes of the
Berlin	LOCATION	revolution natur - ally left a deep impression on the writer 's mind , and the two chapters devoted to the pe - riod are full of graphic interest .

		The family were then living in the Linkstrasse , not far from the scene of the disturbances .

		The catch - words of the day were in the mouths even of the schoolboys ; and the author remembers es - pecially a truculent phrase , '' hanging the last king with the guts of the last priest , '' which he heard for the first time from the lips of a big , blond-bearded man at the sculptor
Streichen	PERSON	- berg 's , a declaimer who talked much of the freedom of the people and of his own mission to pave the way for it , and who was probably comfortably out of danger when the fighting began .

		The ever-recurring catch-word Press - freiheit -LRB- freedom of the press -RRB- was altered by the wags of the school into Fressfreiheit -LRB- lib - erty to stun one 's self -RRB- ; and cries of '' Loyal Legioner , '' '' Pietist , '' '' Friend of Light , '' etc. , were not wanting .

		When the tumult began in the
Schlossplatz	LOCATION	, and the ominous rattle of musketry was heard from the
Leipzigerstrasse	LOCATION	, there was a sudden rush of an excited throng of rioters down the quiet street where the
Ebers	PERSON	lived : `` The tall , bearded fellow at their head we knew well .

		It was the upholsterer
Specht	PERSON	, who had often put up curtains and done similar work for us , a good and capable workman .

		But what a change !

		Instead of a neat little hammer , he was flourishing an axe , and he and his companions looked as if they were going to avenge some terrible injury .

		He caught sight of us , and I remember distinctly the whites of his rolling eyes as he raised his axe higher , and shouted hoarsely , and as if the threat was meant for us : ' They shall get it ! '

		Meanwhile the fighting in the streets seemed to have increased in places to a battle , for the crash of the ar -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 tillery grapeshot was constantly intermingled with the crackling of the infantry fire , and through it all the bells were sounding the tocsin , a wailing , warning sound , which stirred the inmost heart . ''

		Happily , with the night the brief reign of terror was over .

		It was said that all was quiet ; the famous proclamation '' To my dear people of
Berlin	LOCATION	'' was issued ; but Pressfreiheit -LRB- and indeed '' Fressfreiheit '' -RRB- were still below the horizon , while luckless '' upholsterer Specht '' lay quiet enough in the cool of the morning , with outstretched hands that were done with the axe and the '' neat little hammer '' forever .

		The
Berlin	LOCATION	streets on that day presented a strange and terrible medley : '' Here was a pool of blood , there a bearded corpse ; here a blood-stained weapon , there another blackened with powder .

		Like a cauldron where a witch mixes all sorts of strange things for a philtre , each barricade con - sisted of every sort of rubbish , together with objects originally useful .

		All kinds of overturned vehicles , from an omnibus to a perambulator , from a carriage to a hand-cart , were everywhere to be found .

		Ward - robes , commodes , chairs , boards , bookshelves , bath-tubs and wash-tubs , iron and wooden pipes , were piled to - gether , and the interstices filled with sacks of straw and rags , mattresses , and carriage cushions ... Bloody and terrible pictures rose before us , and perhaps there was no need of Assessor Geppert 's calling to us sternly , ' Off home with you , boys ! '

		to turn our feet in that direction . ''

		Touching the mooted question whether the
Berlin	LOCATION	revolution was the result of a long-pre - pared conspiracy or the spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm for liberty among the citizens , Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	adopts the opinion of von Sybel : '' Both these views are equally well founded , for only the united effort of the two forces could insure a pos - sibility of victory . ''

		From the detailed account of the admirable Keilhau school we shall extract only the fol - lowing notice of Frosbel , its founder : '' When we came to
Keilhau	PERSON	he was already sixty-six years old , a man of lofty stature , with a face which seemed to be carved with a dull knife out of brown wood .

		His long nose , strong chin , and large ears , be - hind which the long locks , parted in the middle , were smoothly brushed , would have rendered him positively ugly , had not his ' Come , let us live for our children , ' beamed so invitingly in his clear eyes ... Yet I must confess and his portrait agrees with my memory that his face by no means suggested the idealist and man of feeling ; it seemed rather expressive of shrewd - ness , and to have been lined and worn by severe con - flicts concerning the most diverse interests .

		But his voice and his glance were unusually winning , and his power over the child was limitless .

		A few words were sufficient to win completely the shyest boy whom he de - sired to attract ; and thus it happened that , even when he had been with us only a few weeks , he was never seen crossing the court-yard without a group of the younger pupils hanging to his coat-tails and clasping his hands and arms ... We never called him any - thing but Oheim ' -LRB- uncle -RRB- .

		The word '
Onkel	PERSON	' he de - tested as foreign , because it was derived from ' avun - culus ' and ' oncle . ' ''

		If the reader will call to mind for a mo - ment , in connection with this winning picture , some '' Dr.
Busby	PERSON	'' of his own boyhood , and the probable result of a pupil 's calling the great man '' uncle '' not to speak of '' hanging to his coat-tails , '' the principle that lay at the root of
Frrebel	ORGANIZATION	's ideals becomes apparent .

		Love for the master , and the freest opportu - nity for the development of individual char - acter , was the rule at the Keilhau school . ''

		Wherever I have met , '' says our author , '' An old pupil of Keilhau , I have found in him the same love for the institute , have seen his eyes sparkle more brightly when we talked of Langethal ,
Midden	LOCATION	- dorf , and Barop -LRB- the masters -RRB- .

		Not one has turned out a sneak or a hypocrite . ''

		After a term at the gymnasia of Kottbus and Quedlinburg , Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	entered
Gottingen	LOCATION	, where he resolved to devote himself to the law ; but his studies at this point were cut short by a terrible attack of spinal disease , which for some years left him almost helpless .

		It was during convalescence , however , that he found a final province of labor , a fixed goal toward which to move with firm tread in the seclusion to which his malady condemned him .

		He had been early attracted to Egyptology ; and by the advice of
Jacob Grimm	PERSON	he resolved to take counsel with
Richard Lepsius	PERSON	as to a plan of exhaustive study in that science .

		Lepsius 's re - quirements were sufficiently formidable : '' He had inquired about my previous education , and urged me to study philology , archaeology , and at least one Semitic language .

		... It would be necessary also for me to understand English and Italian , since many things which the Egyptologist ought to know were published in those languages .

		Lastly he advised me to obtain some insight into Sanscrit , which was the point of departure for all linguistic studies . ''

		Lepsius , in brief , impressed upon the au - thor the truth , which he himself afterwards impressed upon his pupils , that it would be a mistake to begin by studying so restricted a science as Egyptology .

		The foundations nec - essary for the special structure must first be firmly laid .

		The programme suggested by
Lepsius	PERSON	was thoroughly carried out , and many details were added including the study of Italian , Spanish , and Dutch .

		The material having been thus laboriously gathered , the ques - tion presented itself , how to turn it to account : This material gave me no peace .

		I soon mastered it completely , but gradually the relation changed and it mastered me , gave me no rest , and forced me to try upon it the poetic power so long condemned to rest . ''

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, In short , Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	resolved , not without some twinges of his scientific conscience , to compose a novel embodying this troublesome material , and the outcome was '' The Egyptian Princess '' a title suggested by
Auerbach	PERSON	.

		His account of the reception by the austere Lepsius of the finished manuscript is amus - ing : '' I had not said even a word in allusion to what I was doing in the evening hours , and the three volumes of my large manuscript were received by him in a way that warranted the worst fears .

		He even asked how I , whom he believed to be a serious worker , had been tempted into such ' side issues . '

		... Yet he kept the manuscript and promised to look at the curiosity .

		He did more .

		He read it through to the last letter , and when , a fortnight later , he asked me at his house to re - main after the others had left , he looked pleased , and confessed that he had found something entirely different from what he had expected .

		The book was a scholarly work , and also a fascinating romance . ''

		With the account of his first novel , Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	closes the first instalment of his autobi - ography .

		We shall look for the half - promised supplementary volume with interest .

		MR.
IRVING	PERSON	'S VIEWS ON THE MODERN DRAMA .

		* Whatever the place to which definitive criti - cism may assign the fame of Mr.
Henry Irving	PERSON	as an actor , there is no possibility that his ser - vice to the stage , as artist , producer , champion , will be overpraised .

		He deserves of his profes - sional brethren more than the pretense of grat - itude , and the intellectual world is under obli - gation to him not merely for additions to its refinement but for positive increase of its knowl - edge .

		It is not necessary to assume that be - fore Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's time there was no actor es - teemed and no art of acting appreciable , for in his excellent little volume of Addresses on the Drama in which jewels of literature sort with gems of reason our lecturer is at loving pains to tell us what noble figures in his regard are four of the masters of other days ,
Burbage	PERSON	,
Betterton	LOCATION	,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Kean	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Irving	PERSON	chanced upon , though he partly brought about , an era of dramatic renaissance , to which
Edwin Booth	PERSON	and
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	in our own country ,
Salvini	PERSON	and
Rossi	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, Son - nenthal and Barnay in
Germany	LOCATION	, were equally coincident and contributory .

		It was the first period in the history of the theatre that found * THE DKAMA .

Henry Irving	PERSON	.

		actors ready and capable to assert themselves as peers in the kingdom of Genius , entitled to move by authority and not by sufferance ; and they claimed the right to be received as equals and factors , not as proteges and exhibits , of the society that tardily opened to them its doors .

		Circumstances have peculiarly favored Mr.
Irving	PERSON	, and he has had the shrewdness to de - rive their full benefit .

		He came in the de - ciduous season of the English stage .

		The great ones were fallen or falling , and there was so little promise in the rising actors that the chief honors were to be worn by him who should most urgently set himself to possess them .

		Though he has something of the poetic temperament and much of artistic culture , Mr.
Irving	PERSON	is firmly practical , methodic , and calcu - lating .

		Ardent impulses never mislead him ; calm , discriminating judgment guides him .

		As a young man he saw the opportunities open - ing to someone in the uncertain conditions of the English theatre , and he determined to be that someone .

		He strove with a strenuousness it is not in the power of fate to resist .

		He began by educating himself , with an eye to mastery ; and , assiduous then , he has been unremitting since .

		Truly and thoroughly proud of his vo - cation , nothing would content him but that it should be so much a pride to others as to give its chief representatives absolute equality with the eminent followers of other arts and profes - sions .

		So it came about that to-day we have , elo - quently worded and of manly spirit , preserved in the covers of a book , lectures delivered by an actor as the nobly honored guest of that stern and
august	DATE	mistress of learning , the
Phil	PERSON	- osophical Institution of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	; of that an - cient contemner of the mummer vagabond , the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	; and of
Harvard	LOCATION	, ven - erable in age but never intolerant .

		That Mr.
Irving	PERSON	should a little exult in his triumph and in the greater triumph of the stage , was a thing expected and pardonable ; but the objection may be urged against him that he has been so can - did in the expression of his satisfaction as rather to give the impression of a favor received than of a right secured .

		However , it must be ad - mitted that for a grievous time in the world 's history the actor class was , partly through its own ignoble obsequiousness , but mostly by force of community prejudices and ignorance , made unworthy social esteem ; and if the old trend of thought bore off the current of new ideas long after the stage had indicated its right to the regard of the wise and the good , there is abundant reason now for gratulation that a
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 better understanding between theatre and pub - lic has been educated .

		Question is made nowadays if the actor 's be not the most difficult , as it is the most com - plex , of all the arts ; and it is pretty well established as a judgment that to be great as an actor entitles the man to a station not less than , nor removed from , that to which fame conducts poet , or painter , or sculptor , or states - man , or preacher . ''

		A theatre , '' one time said
Macready	PERSON	, '' ought to be a place of recreation for the sober-minded and intelligent . ''

		So , indeed , the true theatre is ; for the theatre is not the building from whose plan of construc - tion it takes its name , but the vital drama , plays of life and character and thought and condition - and purpose .

		The great pity is that the drama proper is confounded with amuse - ments , that the theatre is made to take in everything in which there are the arc of a cir - cle and a stage .

		In any serious discussion of the drama , it is always presumed that the refer - ence is to its representative parts , those things in it that are best , noblest , enduring .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	says , as soundly as felicitously : '' The truth is that the immortal part of the stage is its noble part .

		Ignoble accidents and interludes come and go , but this lasts on forever .

		It lives like the hu - man soul in the body of humanity , associated with much that is inferior , and hampered by many hindrances , but it never sinks into nothingness , and never fails to find new and noble work in exactness of permanent and memorable excellence .

		Heaven forbid that I should seem to cover , even with a counterpane of courtesy , ex - hibitions of deliberate immorality .

		Happily this sort of thing is not common , and although it has hardly been practised by anyone who , without a strain of meaning , can be associated with the profession of acting ; yet public < ; ensure , not active enough to repress the evil , is ever ready to pass a sweeping condemnation on the stage which harbors it .

		Our cause is a good one .

		We go forth , armed with the luminous panoply which genius has forged for us , to do battle with dulness , with coarseness , with apathy , with every form of vice and vil .

		In every human heart there gleams a higher re - flection of this shining armor .

		The stage has no lights or shadows that are not lights of life and shadows of the heart .

		To each human consciousness it appeals in alternating mirth and sadness , and will not be denied .

		Err it must , for it is human ; but , being human , it must endure . ''

		Admission is made of the fact that the in - terests of the theatre are sometimes degraded by panders to low , vicious , and morbid tastes ; but fair-minded , intelligent people find no dif - ficulty in discriminating the devotees of the drama from the hucksters and tradespeople of the play-house , nor do they confound the pur - suit of a noble art with the practices of a con - temptible commerce between ignorance and vulgarity .

		But even in such cases there is this to be observed , that the stage '' holds out long against the invitation to pander ; and such invi - tations , from the publicity and decorum that attend the whole matter , are neither frequent nor eager .

		A sort of decency sets in upon the coarsest person in entering even the roughest theatre .

		I have sometimes thought that , con - sidering the liability to descend and the facil - ity of descent , a special providence watches over the morals and tone of our English stage . ''

		He might have said , of the English-speaking stage ; for certainly nothing is more indicative of a protecting spirit of the drama than the high moral tone of the stage of this country , where the only censorship of the drama , and the only restraint upon the theatre , is public opinion .

		May we not see in the survival and triumph of the drama through ages of assault and con - tumely , of persecutions and prohibitions , a di - vine purpose somewhat wiser than the will of man ?

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	has suggested the reason why `` the stage has literally lived down the rebuke and reproach under which it formerly cowered , while its professors have been simultaneously living down the prejudices which excluded them from society . ''

		That reason is , `` The stage is now seen to be an elevating instead of a lowering influence on national morality , and actors and actresses receive in society , as do members of other professions , exactly the treatment which is earned by their professional conduct . ''

		The conditions were very different when each of the four great actors discussed in one of these lectures strove for the laurel .

		Their obligation in the service of their profession was that of pioneers .

		They commanded the emotions of men , and prepared the way for the persuasion of their intelligence .


Thomas Sheridan	PERSON	, in
1746	DATE	, in
Dublin	LOCATION	, pre - cipitated a notorious riot by declaring in the face of a rich young ruffian , who , with others had made a disorder in the theatre , '' I am as good a gentleman as you are . ''

		This impu - dence on the part of an actor though he was the son of old Dr.
Sheridan	PERSON	, scholar and gen - tleman , and a graduate of the university was `` tolerable and not to be endured , '' and for some hours the audacious Thespian was in mor - tal danger .

		At the same time
Garrick	PERSON	was trying to be a gentleman in
London	LOCATION	, and , if not wholly successful in having himself ac - cepted by the noble lords who patronized and condescended to him , he did beat down some of the barriers and cleared a way for others to 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, prosper in .

		The actor need not now eat out his heart with chagrin that his patient merit has to suffer whips and scorns on his profession 's account .

		Society not only welcomes him , but holds him much in favor , for in these times the famous player has the advantage that at - tends preferment after revolution .

		He occu - pies a place in which he yet feels new , and of which he speaks mysteriously , and in which he is regarded with some curiosity .

		Even Mr.
Irving	PERSON	could not repress a sort of chuckle from his lecture before the Philosophical Institution of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		Before long all this reserve and strangeness will have disappeared , and the apologist of the theatre will be as rare a bird as the theatrical '' reformer , '' described as one who combines with intellectual superciliousness a timidity as to moral contamination .

		Mr.
Irv	PERSON	- ing finds the stage as it is both elevating and educating , a social benefactor and benefit to the individual , notwithstanding its sins of omission and of commission ; and I think no sociologist is prepared to dispute him .

		Indeed , the old warfare against the stage is about ended , or , if pursued , is so to the disadvantage of those who wage it ; of course I mean indiscriminate war - fare , battle against the theatre .

		Not less important than the first , but more technical and of immediate interest to the lim - ited number , is Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's lecture on the Art of Acting .

		He finds as remarkable improve - ment in that regard as in the moral and social status of the theatre ; and particularly com - mends the modern adoption of Hamlet 's ad - vice to the players as the rule and guide of action .

		Artifice is more and more dispelled , and the decrees of art become the utterance of nature .

		We learned sometime ago from his friendly rejoinders to Coquelin that Mr.
Irving	PERSON	has no sympathy with the brilliant and specious
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	's idea that the actor must be insensible to the emotions he simulates .

		It seems impos - sible there should be any great acting with - out profound sensibility , though it is the busi - ness of the artist to control his feelings within conscious bounds ; careful not to overstep the modesty of nature by letting passion get the better of judgment .

		Not to follow too far the interesting lead of Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's delightful vol - ume and valuable addition to stage literature , this quotation , which presents a summary of the actor 's art , will serve also as an epitome of the three especially aesthetic lectures : `` It is necessary to this art that the mind should have , as it were , a double consciousness , in which all the emotions proper to the occasion may have full swing , while the actor is all the time on the alert for every detail of his method .

		It may be that his playing will be more spirited one night than another .

		But the actor who combines the electric force of a strong per - sonality with a mastery of the resources of his art must have a greater power over his audiences than the pas - sionless actor who gives a most artistic simulation of the emotions he never experiences . ''

		THE DIAL 93 overdone , and that some among the humorous points that he scores are the result of rather cheap devices , but the tale as a whole is so well-knit , so spirited , and so exciting in its interest , that criticism of the minuter sort stands abashed in its presence .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's '' Pietro Ghisleri '' introduces us once more to the aristocratic Roman society made so familiar by the novels of the '' Saracinesca '' se - ries , and even , incidentally , to many of the charac - ters of those brilliant works of fiction .

		The new story is of surprising interest , and leaves little to be desired , either in constructive skill or in deline - ation of character .

		The plot is complicated and the structure compact ; there is little of the padding that disfigures a number of the author 's books , and often makes us feel that he was hard-pressed to fill the requisite number of pages .

		Many of Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford 's literary excursions have been unfortunate , noticeably his dreary novel of hypnotism and his formless Oriental fantasies ; and we are glad that he has returned to the solid and familiar ground of contemporary life in the country best known to him .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has recently deprecated putting the novelist 's art at the service of science ; but we are bound to express the opinion that , as social or his - torical documents , the series of his Roman stories have claims quite as strong as those based merely upon their power to amuse or to entertain . ''

		From Out of the Past '' is one of the best nov - els that we have lately had occasion to read , and yet , so unobtrusive is its excellence , so far removed from the sensational its manner , it is likely to cause hardly a ripple upon the stream of current fiction .

		The scene is
Touraine	LOCATION	, although the characters are American , and something of the peace and old-world charm of the place has found its way into the au - thor 's pages .

		A deep and exquisite feeling for beauty in landscape and art has given the simple love-story of the book a setting that enhances its meaning at every point .

		The writer knows her Touraine minutely and lovingly ; and as far as her book deals with French life it gives us the sane true life of the provinces , not the false and feverish life of the capital which so many take to be the typical life of
France	LOCATION	.

		Our chief adverse criticism upon the book must be for its occasional lapses into the style of the tourist manual ; the au - thor seems to know Touraine almost too well for strictly artistic purposes .

		The story of the book is skilfully told , although the reader is left until the very end in a not wholly justifiable state of suspense as to the outcome .

		We cordially commend the work to those in search of summer-afternoon literature .

		A strong character gives a name to a strong book in Miss
Elliott	PERSON	's ''
John Paget	PERSON	. ''

		He is one of two brothers whom fate separates when children , one of them to become a worldling , the other he of the title to become , through devious ways , both a preacher and a minister of the Gospel .

		His nature has the stamp of sincerity , and earnestness of pur - pose characterizes his every act .

		His religion , how - ever subject to intellectual limitations , is of the true sort , for it supplements faith by undoubted works , and so commands our respect .

		As a protest against worldliness , as an almost passionate plea for the real - ities as distinguished from the shows of existence , ''
John Paget	PERSON	'' is a book of fine ethical tone and worthy idealism .

		Yet it inculcates one lesson that is , in our opinion , distinctly false in its ethical bear - ings .

		The brothers have a cousin ,
Beatrice	PERSON	, who , after a youth of religious training in a Southern convent , is taken to the home of her relatives in
New York	LOCATION	, and there becomes devotedly attached to
Claude	PERSON	, the brother of the worldly mind and train - ing , who returns her love in at least equal measure .

		Now these two natures are in every essential respect fitted for one another ; yet the shadow of dogma falls between them , and
Beatrice	PERSON	, acting from what she supposes to be religious conviction , tears her love from her heart , and dies as the consequence .

		The author 's sympathies are clearly with her hero - ine in this course ; that is , we are clearly given to understand that she believes it right that two lives should be wrecked by a barren intellectual abstrac - tion .

		Such tragedies occur in real life , no doubt , and perhaps we can not greatly blame those who are directly responsible for them ; but no condemnation of the system that trains young girls to act as
Bea	LOCATION	- trice does can be too strong .

		Miss
Elliott	PERSON	gives tacit assent to the system , and so her book seems to us to embody a profoundly immoral lesson .

		To the author , and to her heroine , certain passages -LRB- espe - cially in the preface -RRB- of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' Sesame and Lilies '' might be recommended as profitable reading .

		It is a pity that so good and thoughtful a book as ''
John Paget	PERSON	'' should have been marred by this insistence upon matters of '' mint and anise and cummin , '' even if '' the weightier matters of the law '' be not wholly neglected .

		A mining engineer from
New England	LOCATION	, search - ing for gold on a
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation , incidentally falling in love with a fair maiden of the South , and coming to a tragic end in the old graveyard to which , without reckoning upon native prejudice and super - stition , he had extended his diggings this is the story told in '' Broadoaks '' by
Miss McClelland	PERSON	.

		The first thing that occurs to the reader is the use made by Miss Murfree of a similar situation , al - though the resemblance is not carried into detail .

		The story is well thought out , has the atmosphere of its locality , and offers , in its negro-character sketches , a certain element of semi-humorous diversion . ''

		The Love Affairs of an Old Maid '' are really the love affairs of a number of her friends , reflected in the sympathetic and generous consciousness of the narrator .

		In these pages , unaffected and ex - quisite in style , sparkling with humor , yet softened by a pathos that reaches the very depths of the spiritual life , are sketched the heart-stories of a doz - en men and women , each with a few swift incisive strokes , and , for the most part , an insight that makes of the book a gallery of distinctly individual 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, outline portraits .

		We imply no censure in saying that it is a woman 's book , in noting the obvious fact that the men , with one exception , appear in but shadowy characterization .

		In the subtlety of her analysis , the writer reminds us not a little of Mrs.
Clifford	PERSON	, while in her successful use of the epigram she suggests the brilliant Englishwoman who chooses to sign her very feminine books with the assertively masculine name of ''
John Oliver Hobbes /	PERSON	' Miss Bell is , we understand , a new-comer in the field of letters .

		It may safely be said that she has already won her spurs , and that her present performance justifies a lively expectation of excellent things to come .

		We hope that a rather forbidding title will not deter possible readers from making speedy ac - quaintance with a book possessing so distinct a charm .

		In '' Old
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	'' Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	has given us another of her delicate outline pictures of life in the Old Northwest .

		The story is placed in the early days of the present century , and in the town that was soon to become the first capital of a great commonwealth .

		It has for its culminating episode a great rising of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in which half Kas - kaskia was submerged , and which extricates the tangled threads of romance woven by the author 's art , breaking some of them off , and uniting those that remain into more symmetrical patterns .

		The contrasted French and English types of character are delineated with a subtle feeling for their essen - tial differences , while Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's restrained and exquisite style gives literary charm to every page of her work .

		One can not help wishing that the author would , for once , work upon a larger canvas than any she has yet sought to cover .

		The field she has chosen is almost her own , and its ro - mantic possibilities are considerable . ''

		Toppleton 's Client '' is an extravaganza that ranges all the way from dry Stocktonian humor to roaring farce .

		The central idea is that of the ex - change of souls between bodies , and we may easily imagine the opportunities it offers a writer intent only upon the possible humorous complications .

		The '' client '' is an exiled spirit whose body is occupied by a usurping fiend , and who engages Toppleton -LRB- a law - yer whose chief work of reference is the '' Comic Blackstone '' -RRB- to possess him once more of the bod - ily estate that he has lost .

		But the fiend is too sharp for the lawyer , and , preferring
Toppleton	ORGANIZATION	's cor - poreal tenement to that in which he has been fraud - ulently dwelling , effects a substitution , and leaves Toppleton helpless , either to protect the rights of his client or to re-establish his own .

		The extrava - ganza is overdone , here and there , and its theory will not bear close scrutiny , but it is , as a whole , entertaining .

		Of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Many Inventions , '' many turn out to be variations upon the old familiar ones , and one gets a little tired even of
Mulvaney	PERSON	and Or - theris and all the rest of the tribe of
Atkins	PERSON	.

		But the volume contains one piece -LRB- which no one can for - get who read it in the English review where it first appeared -RRB- which we are inclined to rank as the cleverest thing and perhaps the most finely imag - inative that the author has ever done in prose .

		It is that romance of metempsychosis that he has chosen to style '' The Finest Story in the World . ''

		The quotation-marks of this title are Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's , not ours , but we should be almost content to drop them , letting the name stand as a description of the author 's own work , not of the work of his imagin - ary hero .

		It was a true stroke of genius to re - incarnate , in a cockney banker 's clerk , one of the men who sailed with
Thorfin Karlsefne	PERSON	, and to be - stow upon him reminiscent flashes of his past lives .

		The other stories in the book are of unequal value ; one can hardly escape being fascinated by Mul - vaney 's adventure with '' My Lord the Elephant , '' or finding in '' A Conference of the Powers '' a les - son at least worth the pondering .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	both introduces and closes his new collection of tales by some spirited verses .

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has long before this shown himself an adept in the art of the short story , and his new volume is , as a matter of course , vivacious and entertaining .

		The characters that he knows best are those supplied by his own
New York	LOCATION	en - vironment of club and society life , although he reaches out , not without success , on one occasion to the wilds of
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, and , on another , back to
Augustan Rome	LOCATION	.

		There are five stories alto - gether , two of which are distinctly romantic , one mildly satirical , one essentially humorous , and one a combination of all three of these qualities .

		We leave his readers to classify the five in accordance with our suggested scheme .

		Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	is a new-comer among the tellers of short stories , but it is clear that she has mastered more than the rudiments of the art .

		Her work comes close to that of Miss
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	, not only in its choice of village scene and people , but also in its observation of the minuter humors of life , and in the delicacy of its treatment .

		Humor in any broader sense is lacking the writer , and the pathos of her humble tragedies seems to need some such relief as would be afforded by an occasional breeze blown from the brighter parts of life .

		She might profitably study '' Octave Thanet , '' for exam - ple , with a view of making up for this defect . ''

		Mr.
Tommy	PERSON	Dove '' and '' A Fourth-class Ap - pointment '' are decidedly the best of the five sto - ries , the latter being as effective a sermon on be - half of civil service reform as one often hears from a pulpit of any sort .

		If such stories could be mul - tiplied , they might prove the very best way of strik - ing the national conscience with shame for the '' system '' that has so cankered the vital organs of our political life .

		In passing from the volume just mentioned to the new series of Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	's '' Day and Night Stories , '' we go all the way from realism to ro - mance , and find that , after all , romance is more sat -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL isfying than the most faithful realism .

		As a speci - men of romance in miniature , it would not be easy to surpass '' A
Toledo Blade	ORGANIZATION	, '' which is a master - piece of both style and construction .

		The half dozen stories that go with it are only less admira - ble examples of fictive art .

		They possess the qual - ity of distinction in a marked degree the dis - tinction that betokens a mind well-cultured and responsive to a wide range of emotional appeal .

		Trifling as two or three of the stories appear at first sight , no one of them comes to an end without sounding , at least for a moment , some deep recess of the soul .

		Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	knows , far better than most tellers of tales , just what ought to be said , and what must be left unsaid , to make a story as effect - ive as possible .

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		We are wont to look very much askance at every new text-book of biology .

		So many of them are al - ready in the field struggling for life , many of them goaded to the unequal combat by the stimulating influences of their publishers ' voices , that we insist now that each new competitor shall demonstrate his right to enter the lists .

		With a knowledge of the difficulties of the case , Professor
John Bidgood	PERSON	has prepared his '' Course of Practical Biology '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		There is one respect in which the work can fairly be said to be a departure .

		Each subject that is taken for study is treated in a series of para - graphs , each one of which directs some operation , the point of which is discussed in its immediate connection .

		This ought to have the effect of mak - ing a student thoughtful of the progress and sig - nificance of his work .

		We do not know of any other biological text-book in which this principle is so well applied as here .

		The subjects first taken up are several of the Fungi and Protococcus .

		A chap - ter on the
Bacteria	LOCATION	is included , with directions for some simpler experiments in culture and a consid - eration of their relation to disease .

		Then
Chara	PERSON	, the
Fern	PERSON	, and the Nettle are taken up in great de - tail .

		These complete the botanical side of the work , and occupy in all about half of the treatment .

		The fifty-four pages devoted to the Fungi and
Proto	PERSON	- coccus form as good an introduction to the modes of biological work and thought as has yet appeared .

		We do not see , however , any sufficient reasons for the selection of
Chara	LOCATION	, or for the choice of the net - tle rather than of some others of the Phanerogams with a regularly racial flower as , for instance , the geranium , which latter can be had at all sea - sons at the florist 's .

		We also regret that some of the filamentous algje were not touched on , if only briefly , as they are so very accessible for study .

		The animal forms selected are Amreba ,
Vorticella	LOCATION	,
Paramecium	LOCATION	,
Hydra	ORGANIZATION	,
Anodonta	LOCATION	,
Astacus	LOCATION	, and
Rana	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are all well treated on the side of anatomy , but , as is the fashion in general text-books , they are very incomplete on the embryological side .

		On the other hand , the subject of
Vertebrate Histology	ORGANIZATION	re - ceives very satisfactory attention .

		It will be seen that the work is one which covers a very large area .

		While it is necessarily greatly condensed , it is at the same time written in such a perfectly clear style that it is wholly intelligible , and the lay reader , as well as the student , will find it a very valuable presentation of the leading principles of the science .

		An Introduction of twenty-four pages covers the essentials of microscopical technique .

		The work is illustrated throughout , in part with the author 's drawings and in part with many standard illustra - tions .

		In the histological part of the chapters on the Frog the cuts are largely from
Quain	PERSON	's Anat - omy .

		It was cer - tainly worth while to offer the book in its present form to English and American students .

		Like other books prepared for the use of Indian under - graduates , this volume explains many things that any good dictionary could explain , but on the other hand it interprets many phases of the Idylls that no reference-book alludes to .

		There are chapters on the sources of the Arthurian story , on its growth from
Malory	LOCATION	to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and on personages and localities spoken of in the modern epic .

		Then follow stud - ies of each Idyll , and annotations on particular words and obscure points .

		The work is by no means ex - haustive , but the material is carefully selected and well arranged .

		There is a constant comparison of
Tennyson	LOCATION	with
Malory	PERSON	and the
Mabinogion	PERSON	, and many interesting points of departure are suggested to the reader .

		The interpretation of the allegor - ical bearing of the Idylls is sensible and apprecia - tive , and the treatment of the rise of the legend , although brief , is in the main accurate .

		Rather strangely , however , Mr.
Littledale	PERSON	takes no account of such an authoritative work as Professor
Rhys	PERSON	's '' Arthurian Legend . ''

		The work can readily be used as a handbook in a
Tennyson	LOCATION	class .

B. O. Flower	PERSON	nty life .

		paints a lurid picture of the seamy and gruesome side of modern city life .

		Besides the Introduction , there are seven chapters -LRB- expanded from articles published in `` The Arena '' -RRB- , with the following titles , which indicate the spirit of sensa - tionalism that marks and mars the book : '' Society 's Exiles , '' '' Two Hours in the Social Cellar , '' < The Democracy of Darkness , '' `` Why the Ishmaelites Multiply , '' '' The Froth and the Dregs , '' '' A Pil - grimage and a Vision , '' and '' What of the Mor - row ? ''

		The author is evidently a man of earnest purpose , who has a very keen and genuine sympa - thy for the unfortunate classes whose condition he 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, portrays in these pages .

		He writes some passages that glow with an eloquence born of deep feeling and felicitous phrase ; hut as a rule he lays on the red paint a little too lavishly , while he makes it too apparent that he is striving to produce an effect .

		The grime and want and wretchedness which he depicts do exist ; these heartrending miseries are realities .

		So far as Mr.
Flower	PERSON	reports what he himself has seen , his earnest words are calcu - lated to arrest attention and arouse sympathy .

		And it seems ungracious to criticise one whose heart is aglow with interest in behalf of our destitute and depraved fellows .

		But a careful reading of this volume leaves the impression that Mr.
Flower	PERSON	's ob - servations in this noisome but pitiable realm have not been sufficiently painstaking and searching to make his pages of value to the scientific student of social problems or to the practical philanthropist .

		As photographs of certain conditions , they may stir people to thought and sympathy ; but they do not penetrate deep enough to lead to helpful action .

		There is no adequate discussion of causes or de - scription of remedies .

		When we come to the last chapter , '' What of the Morrow ? ''

		we are given nothing more than a few familiar and glittering generalities .

		The way out is not described ; the methods by which this Inferno may be turned into a Paradise are not defined .

		A new edition of
Juvenal	ORGANIZATION	's Satires .

		Professor
F. P. Nash	PERSON	's edition of the first two Satires of Juvenal -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- shows sufficient schol - arship and considerable general information .

		It is put forth as a specimen of a larger work which will perhaps find a small circle of usefulness among the many learned editions of this more than sufficiently edited poet .

		It is hard to say for what readers the present volume is intended .

		No teacher will care to confine his class to the first two Satires .

		The col - lege graduate who desires to renew his acquaint - ance with the `` authors '' -LRB- if that much-invoked personage exists in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- will want more di - rect help in construing , and less erudition .

		The scholar who uses Mayor will find little if anything new here .

		Mr.
Nash	PERSON	is under an illusion in this regard .

		The new matter in his notes is of the kind that a well-informed discursive teacher will some - times dictate to a class of students whom he has trained to bring up their lessons in good shape .

		It is not a serious contribution to the interpretation of Juvenal .

		Part VII .

		of the great
English Dic	ORGANIZATION	- The seventh part .

		of the '' Great En - tionary of the Philological Society * ary > '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- extends from
Consignif	LOCATION	- icant to Crouching , and contains 5414 main words , 936 combinations , and
1190	DATE	subordinate words and forms .

		Twenty-five per cent of the words are marked as either obsolete or incompletely naturalized .

		We quote an interesting prefatory note on the word Cross : '' The influence of historical events on the fortunes of a word finds a remarkable exemplifica - tion in the case of Cross .

		What Roman in pres - ence of the ignominious associations that attached to its Latin original crux , and the expression , ' / in crucem ! '

		could have conceived that a time would come when Cross would be one of the great diction - ary words of a far greater language than his own ; that besides embracing senses so distinct as the in - strument of crucifixion , a decoration of an order , a piece of money , an intermixture of breeds , not to mention thirty other applications , the word would also be an adjective , a verb , an adverb , and a pre - position ; and in each of these capacities give rise to a multitude of compounds and derivations , of which 284 would require treatment in the Diction - ary ? ''

		This instalment of the
Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	concludes the long series of '' Con '' - prefixed words , and goes well into '' Cr , '' which is '' noteworthy for its nu - merous echoic or imitative words expressing sounds , usually of an abrupt , rough , or harsh kind , and the actions accompanied by such sounds . ''

Mississippi	LOCATION	Val - ley , so closely associated with this subject is Bien - ville 's biography .

		Its pages , 327 in number , are very interesting , but naturally appeal more to the general reader than to the historian .

		They pre - sent in our own language and in a popular form what must otherwise be found in Margry 's '' De - couvertes et Etablissement de Francais . ''

		Popular images of
Robert Morris	PERSON	are broken into a thousand pieces ; but the image substituted seems imperfect .

		The reader must go elsewhere for a satisfactory portrait of the great financier .

		So much attention is given to de - stroying , and the destroying is done with such en - ergy , that much of the merit in

		This is probably due in a measure to the facts that the book is an adaptation and that it is necessarily small .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` intended to supply the want of a system of writing shorter and more compact than ordinary longhand , and at the same time not less distinct and legible . ''

		Mr.
Sweet	PERSON	's method is upon a script basis , and is worked out in two forms : '' one or - thographic , simply constructed , and of moderate speed , the other phonetic , in which brevity may be carried to its utmost legitimate limits . ''

		He claims that his system is the first workable pure script shorthand that has been brought out in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The volume is very neatly printed .

		THE `` Vertebrate Embryology '' of Dr.
A. Millies Marshall	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- deals exhaustively with the embry - onic development of five typical vertebrate forms amphioxus , the frog , the chick , the rabbit , and man .

		The account of the latter form , in particular , is a highly satisfactory exposition of the present state of knowl - edge upon the subject , and will be found as useful to the physician as to the biologist .

		The figures are very numerous , and many of them are new .

		The work is handsomely printed .

		The career of the late Sir
Richard F. Burton	PERSON	, the distinguished traveler , and editor of `` The Arabian Nights , '' was perhaps the most adventurous and romantic of any Englishman of the hist generation .

		He was an encyclopedic scholar , and much more than a scholar .

		He knew and had seen more of dark
Africa	LOCATION	than most men , and more of Mohammedan lands than any man .

		It seemed a simple thing for him to travel in disguise among fanatics where discovery meant death , but his life was manysided , and his biography illustrates a remarkable va - riety of interests .

		Lady
Burton	PERSON	has proved her literary ability before , and iu these volumes she has done justice to an exceptional opportunity .

Steel	PERSON	suggests Mr.

		Mrs.

		122 A MID WA Y RE VIE W .

		The
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	has now been open to the public for a period of four months , and ten million paid admissions have been reg - istered by the turnstiles at the gates .

		Seven or eight million more are practically assured , and , if an extension of the term into the open - ing weeks of
November	DATE	should be found prac - ticable , it is by no means impossible that the number of admissions now recorded should be doubled before the close .

		The prospect is thus very cheering , and satisfies , perhaps exceeds , all reasonable anticipations .

		That the Fair will pay every dollar of its bonded indebted - ness is now beyond a doubt ; and few , having any adequate conception of the undertaking , ever supposed that it would do much more than this .

		The stockholders , including the City of
Chicago	LOCATION	, understood from the outset that their subscriptions were largely in the nature of a gift , and looked for their reward in ways more or less indirect .

		That reward , even in the tan - gible form of pecuniary profit , bids fair to be realized by many of them not , of course , by all , for , in the very nature of things , such a distribution could not find its way back into the exact channels whence the contributions flowed .

		In spite of the many instances in which individual expectation has come short of real - ization , there can not be the least doubt that the community as a whole has reason to be grateful to the Fair for the influx of currency and the stimulation of trade that have come in its train .

		The severity of the commercial de - pression , elsewhere so marked , has in this city been noticeably mitigated , and many an insti - tution has been saved from financial disaster .

		Of the intangible rewards that will come from the influence of so magnificent a demonstration of the possibilities of civilization it would be impossible to speak adequately without speak - ing at far greater length than our space per - mits ; these rewards will be disclosed in hun - dreds of subtle and unforeseen ways in the years to come .

		Although the term appointed is now two - thirds complete , it is probably fair to say , in view of the increased numbers that will throng the streets of the
White City	LOCATION	during its closing months , that the exhibition is but half over , that we have now reached a point midway in its course .

		At such a point in the history of any great enterprise it is well to pause for a moment , reviewing the accomplishment of the past , and regarding the probable outcome of the future .

		It is the purpose of this article to take such a backward and forward glance from one point of view only , from that of the ideal possibilities of the enterprise as contrasted with the actual realization of the daring and high - principled conception with which its directors 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, set out .

		If , in making this survey , we have occasion to subject the management of the Fair to severe adverse criticism , it must be re - membered that from other points of view , which we do not here attempt to assume , that man - agement has deserved the highest praise .

		There has , for example , been no taint of jobbery in the direction of its vast and lavish scheme of expenditure ; there has been no lack of self - sacrificing devotion , prompted by genuine civic and personal pride , on the part of the execu - tive officers of the organization .

		The original conception of the Exposition was characterized by a fine disregard of the mean practical motives that might so easily have come to prevail in the councils of its man - agement .

		It was clearly understood that the mere suggestion of a universal exhibition to be held in this city would be met all over the world with the cry , '' Can any good thing come out of
Chicago	LOCATION	? ''

		and it was resolved that the cry should be silenced , not by words , but by most effective deeds .

		The common expectation that a
Chicago	LOCATION	Fair would prove a vast exemplifi - cation of the material and commercial aspects of civilization should be met by a Fair in which art was exalted above manufacturing and the ideal above the narrowly practical .

		In this spirit was inaugurated the whole magnificent plan for a hitherto unequalled exhibition of ar - chitecture and landscape gardening , of music , and the arts of form , of science and industry , of objective and intellectual cosmopolitanism .

		In this spirit the best architects , sculptors , and painters were called together to design and dec - orate the buildings , and the best landscape gar - deners to beautify the site , all being given the greatest possible freedom to do their work with artistic effect alone in view .

		In this spirit a great musical leader was engaged , given practically unlimited resources , and told to prepare such an exhibit of his art as the world had never before known .

		In this spirit commissions were sent to foreign countries to collect the masterpieces of modern art , and expeditions were fitted out to bring together from the remote parts of earth the relics of primitive man .

		In this spirit a large sum of money was set aside to endow the city of the Fair with a permanent sculptured me - morial of the eventful year , and a still larger sum of money was devoted to the strictly in - tellectual work of the World 's
Congress Aux	ORGANIZATION	- iliary , work that could not be expected to yield any but an intellectual return .

		We have by no means exhausted the list of the methods by which the directors of the Exposition sought once for all to refute the widespread notion that
Chicago	LOCATION	was a community devoid of ideal interests , sought definitively to substitute newer and more worthy associations for those com - monly linked with its name .

		The methods , as a whole , were characterized by large-minded - ness ; they brought moral and intellectual con - siderations within their purview ; they took thought for the verdict of the future rather than for the clamor of the present .

		It is unpleasant now , in our midway retro - spect of the course followed by the directors of the Exposition , to be forced to chronicle a mel - ancholy derogation from the high motives which controlled the inception and early history of their work .

		The commercial motive has forced its way to the surface , and has become the con - trolling influence in their action .

		The object of the Fair is now frankly proclaimed to be that of making as much money for its stock - holders as possible .

		Amusement , of cheap and even vulgar sorts , is being substituted for educa - tion , because most people prefer being amused to being instructed .

		The popular devices of the country fair are being resorted to , and the greased pole figured in a recently published list of attractions for a particular day .

		Such pleasing novelties , announced in great variety from day to day , are converting the Exposition , as far as it is possible , into a huge circus -LRB- the
Plaisance	PERSON	furnishing the sideshows -RRB- , and mark a process of degradation aptly described by its sponsors as that of '' barnumising the Fair . ''

		Now all this would have been deplorable enough had it been necessary to save the Fair from bankruptcy .

		But there has never been any serious danger that the income would be in - sufficient to pay the bills and meet the bonded indebtedness of the Exposition , while the stock subscriptions were made , as we have already pointed out , with a very clear understanding that no considerable fraction of them would come directly back .

		The directors were thus in the position of trustees of an enterprise un - dertaken less for financial returns than for the glory of accomplishing a great and worthy ob - ject .

		To all appearances , they started out with a distinct consciousness of the high nature of this trust ; to all appearances , they have made to greed at least a partial sacrifice of their principles .

		The most signal illustration of their weak - ness , and of the decline of their ideals under the pressure of the commercial spirit , is offered by their treatment of the musical department of the Fair .

		To begin with , they incurred large
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 107 preliminary expenses in the erection of two concert buildings .

		They then placed the mu - sical arrangements in the most competent of possible hands , contracted for the season with a large orchestra , and made many engagements with artists at home and abroad .

		Their aim , which no one can deny was well taken , was to place the music of the Fair upon an equal foot - ing with the painting , the sculpture , and the architecture .

		For three months , or therea - bouts , the plans thus made were carried out to the satisfaction of all whose opinion is worth considering .

		Then came the disgraceful news - paper attack upon the musical director , by which at first they very properly refused to be influenced .

		But at last , under the pressure of large expenses and unsatisfactory receipts , they weakly accepted the resignation generously of - fered by the musical director -LRB- who may well have been disheartened by the malignant in - sults heaped upon him by the press , but who deserved , on that account all the more , the un - hesitating support of the directors -RRB- , and calmly announced their intention of repudiating the contracts they had made with the orchestra .

		The orchestra could not , of course , be thus dis - missed , for its legal rights are perfectly clear ; but the fact that it will remain brings no credit to the directors who sought deliberately to ig - nore those rights .

		The musical director , like - wise , might have remained had he chosen , and the acceptance of his generosity is even less creditable to the directors than their avowed intention of violating their contracts with the orchestra .

		Naturally the directors sought to excuse their extraordinary conduct in this mat - ter , and therefore pleaded the necessity of a reduction in the running expenses of the Fair .

		What this plea amounts to we have already seen , and had it amounted to much more it would not have justified a clearly dishonorable course .

		A secondary plea , put forward in all seriousness , although its absurdity is appar - ent , was to the effect that the musical depart - ment of the Fair should be disestablished be - cause it was not paying for itself .

		As if any department of the Fair , or the Fair as a whole , paid , or was expected to pay , for itself !

		On this theory the Art Building might be closed to the public , or its wall stripped of paintings and hung with chromos .

		The fact is , of course , that the department of music , besides contrib - uting greatly , like the department of fine arts , to the general attractiveness of the Exposition , and thus paying for itself in the only sense that could reasonably be required , did further pay for itself in a specific sense , to the amount of the admission fees charged for some of the more important concerts .

		In this respect the mu - sical feature of the Fair had a distinct advant - age over all the others , and should have been singled out , if at all , to be retained rather than to be cut off .

		We might adduce other illustrations of the unprincipled , or at least low-principled , meth - ods that have come to prevail of late in the management of the Exposition .

		The cheese - paring policy that would have cut off current expenditures for music , leaving the costly mu - sic halls unused , may be parallelled by the pol - icy that has crippled the work of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although for that work a large building appropriation was made at the start , the petty sums needed for clerical help r for the printing of programmes , and for keep - ing a record of the proceedings , have either been grudgingly bestowed or withheld alto - gether .

		The attitude of the directors toward * the question of
Sunday	DATE	closing is a further striking illustration of the decline from prin - ciple to expediency ; it has even caused many to doubt whether principle was involved at any stage of the discussion , and has earned the contempt of both parties alike .

		These , and other instances , might be enlarged upon as we have enlarged upon the music episode , but that episode is so typical of the class to which it be - longs that its lesson does not need reinforce - ment .

		When , in the future , we shall look back upon the history of the great exhibition , it is unpleasant to think that our view will include so much to awaken regret , when we might so easily have bequeathed to posterity the mem - ory of a noble purpose , not only planned with regard to ideal ends , but consistently carried out with no other than those ends in view .

		THE AUGUST CONGRESSES .

		The Education meetings of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	, summarized at length in the last issue of THE DIAL , have been followed during the five weeks from
July 31	DATE	to
September 2	DATE	, inclusive , by meetings devoted to the consideration of a great va - riety of subjects .

		Art and Engineering occupied the first of the five weeks now under discussion .

		The Art Congresses included meetings of painters and sculptors , decorative and ceramic artists , ar - chitects , and photographers .

		The American In - stitute of Architects met in connection with these Congresses , and its sessions were probably the most important held in this department .

		A notable fea - ture of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Painting and Sculpture was 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the lecture by Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	on '' The Illustrative Arts of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Engineering Congress	ORGANIZATION	must be ranked among the great successes of the Auxiliary scheme .

		The number of foreign delegates was very large , and among them were the most eminent regresentatives of the profession .

		Be - sides the regular sections of civil , mechanical , min - ing , metallurgical , and military engineers , there was an important section devoted to engineering educa - tion , and another to the subject of aerial naviga - tion .

		The engineering sessions were mainly given over to the discussion of papers which had been printed in advance and circulated among the mem - bers .

		The week beginning
August 7	DATE	was devoted to the subject of
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and the proceedings included a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Suffrage , a
Congress on City Government	ORGANIZATION	, and Congresses on the reform of jurisprudence and of the civil service .

		The week of
August 14	DATE	was set apart for a number of Con - gresses not easily classifiable under the regular de - partments of the Auxiliary , the most important of them being a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on
Africa	LOCATION	, historical , geo - graphical , ethnological , literary , scientific , religious , and social .

		The Arbitration and
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	, also comprised within this week , was of much in - terest .

		Science and
Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	held the Auxiliary fort during the week beginning
August 21	DATE	.

		Chem - istry , Meteorology , Geology , Electricity , and Math - ematics and Astronomy were the subjects of five sections , each of which called out a considerable at - tendance of specialists .

		The
Electricity Congress	ORGANIZATION	included the special meetings of a small body of representative electricians , sent to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by various countries as governmental delegates , and charged with the task of adopting a uniform inter - national system of electrical units .

		Dr. von Helm - holtz , who represented the German government in this '' Chamber of Delegates , '' was naturally the guest of honor even among men so distinguished as his associates . ''

		Psychical Science '' was the sub - ject of a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	some of whose sessions must have made the judicious grieve .

		It was given dig - nity by the presence and frequent participation of Mr.
Frederic W. H. Myers	PERSON	, and , we need hardly add , proved the popular success of the week .

		The
Philosophical Congress	ORGANIZATION	was of surprising interest , and its discussions proved to be animated , stimulat - ing , and serious .

		Among those who took part in them were Professors
Josiah Royce	PERSON	,
J. Macbride Sterrett	PERSON	,
J. Clark Murray	PERSON	,
Paul Shorey	PERSON	, and Les - ter
F. Ward	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Congresses for the week begin - ning
August 28	DATE	, just ending , have included , first of all , Zoology and Anthropology , both really belong - ing to the week preceding , but necessarily postponed .

		Strictly speaking , the subject of this week 's Con - gresses has been
Economic Science	ORGANIZATION	, with special sec - tions on Labor , Profit-sharing , and Single Tax .

		The
Jewish Congress	ORGANIZATION	, also included within the pro- gramme of this week , anticipates the Congresses in the
Department of Religion	ORGANIZATION	, which will begin Sep - tember 4 , and take up the remainder of the month .

		It will be seen from the rapid survey above given that the Congresses of the month of
August	DATE	have been among the most important of the whole series , and have given President
Bonney	PERSON	renewed reason to congratulate himself upon the success of the im - mense organization at whose head he stands .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` THE USE AND ABUSE OF SLANG . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Generally as a man grows older he gains confidence in his own abilities ; and I must confess that the arti - cles evoked by the little linguistic essays of mine which have appeared in the
July	DATE	number of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Mag - azine '' for now three years are gradually giving me a great conceit as to my own ability to write sentences which can be misunderstood despite my utmost endeavor to make my meaning plain .

		If , for example , I implied as Mr.
Pitts Duffield	PERSON	, in his very courteous commu - nication in THE DIAL of
August 16	DATE	seems to suggest that '' all the rubbish '' of accidental and temporary slang should sweep '' along undammed , '' I implied what I did not mean .

		What I desired to say , and what I thought I had said , was that the exclusive control of language ought not to be in the hands of a single class , even though that class were composed wholly of '' our most competent scholars . ''

		I am sorry that there are not more clergymen and more college professors in the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	; but I should gravely doubt the action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	if it were composed wholly of college professors or of clergymen .

		THE '' NEW THEOLOGY '' AND QUACKERY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As an interested reader of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, permit me to call attention to a misleading statement in your issue for Au - gust 16 .

		In your leading editorial of that date , you say : '' The mass of newspaper readers approve of the pa - per so carefully adjusted to their tastes , just as the pa - tients of our practitioner of the ' new medicine ' or the hearers of our preacher of the ' new theology ' approve of the quackery of which they are the willing dupes . ''

		This statement makes the '' new theology '' synony - mous with '' quackery . ''

		And , though the writer of this protest is too radical to be identified with the '' new theol - ogy , '' he believes that the movement known as the '' new theology '' is very far from quackery .


Lyman Abbott	PERSON	,
Newman Smyth	PERSON	, and Dr.
Briggs	PERSON	are the acknowledged leaders of this movement .

		And , whatever else may be said of them , they can not be counted men who carefully adjust their preaching or their teaching to the tastes of their hearers ; nor can they be called theologic quacks .

		Feeling sure that your candor will induce you to cor - rect this -LRB- to me -RRB- unjustifiable statement , or , should you still hold to the view expressed , to justify that view , I am , very truly yours , LEON A -
HARVEY	PERSON	.

		-LSB- We willingly print the above letter , but can not refrain from an expression of surprise that our meaning , in the article referred to , should have been entirely misunderstood .

		In the opening sentences of the paragraph to which our correspondent takes ex - ception , we had occasion to define a certain type of

		THE DIAL 109 clergymen who should preach a doctrine care - fully selected for its paying qualities '' and the sim - ilar type of physician '' who should take up with what he knew to be quackery because he expected from it large financial returns . ''

		Our object in the selection and definition of these types was merely to illustrate , by the analogy of other professions , the leading principle of the `` new journalism . ''

		Later on in the paragraph , speaking of the news - paper produced by the new journalism , '' we used the language that our correspondent has so misun - derstood .

		The words '' our practitioner '' and '' our preacher , '' of course , merely referred back to the definitions previously given , to the offensive types of clergyman and physician selected for the purpose of illustrating by comparison the turpitude of the journalist .

		It is very surprising to us that the words should have been construed into an attack upon Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	and Dr.
Briggs	PERSON	, or upon the `` new theol - ogy '' i * 1 an y other than the narrow special sense just before carefully defined .

		AN UNAUTHORITATIVE AUTHORITY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At page 114 of his '' Recent Exemplifications of False Philology '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	, 1872 -RRB- , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	said : `` To the authorities for expressions like is being built , which I formerly adduced , I can now add
Shelley	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	, Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	, Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, and the Rev.
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	. ''

		Although there might be different opinions concern - ing the value , as authorities for grammatical usage , of most of the writers mentioned at least when regarded separately , yet there could be hardly any doubt as to the importance that would be attached to the name of
John Henry Newman	PERSON	.

		What Dr.
Hall	PERSON	himself thought of Dr.
Newman	PERSON	as an authority has been shown in pas - sages quoted by me in a former letter .

		I will quote one of them again , at somewhat greater length , because it contains the gist of the matter now to be considered .

		In an appendix to his '' Modern English '' -LRB-
1873	DATE	, pp .

		321-359 -RRB- Dr.
Hall	PERSON	returns to the discussion of is being built , and there -LRB- pp. 328-9 -RRB- says : '' I need , surely , name no more , among the dead , who found is being built , or the like , acceptable , ... and we all know that the sort of phraseology under consideration is daily be - coming more and more common .

		The best-written of the English reviews , magazines , and journals are perpetually marked by it ; and some of the choicest of living English writers employ it freely .

		Preeminent among these stands Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, who wrote , as far back as
1846	DATE	: ' At this very moment , souls are being led into the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, on the most various and independent impulses , and from the most opposite directions . ''

		-LRB- Essays Critical and Historical , Vol .

		2 , p. 448 -RRB- . ''

		Bishop Wilberforce shall be summoned next . ''

		-LSB- Then fol - low four illustrative quotations from the bishop 's writings . -RSB-

		No other instance of the use of this form of expres - sion by Dr.
Newman	PERSON	is quoted or referred to by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	in this appendix of thirty-nine pages -LRB- where less important authorities are quoted several times -RRB- , although Dr.
Hall	PERSON	had previously said -LRB- p. 292 -RRB- that he had '' studied nearly every line of Dr.
Newman	PERSON	's voluminous writings . ''

		This quotation from
Newman	PERSON	, with others from other writers illustrative of '' imperfects passive , '' was contributed by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	to '' A New English Dic - tionary on Historical Principles , '' where , shortened , it appears under Be .

		Now an inquisitive reader would like to know whether Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, at the time he wrote the remarks quoted above , had knowledge of such a number of instances where Dr.
Newman	PERSON	had used this locution in his voluminous writ - ings , that he , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, could fairly say , either by direct assertion or by implication , that Dr.
Newman	PERSON	employed it freely . ''

		It will be noticed that the propriety of is being built is not questioned here ; that has been lone settled .

		I do not know how many examples of the '' imperfect passive '' have been added from
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's writings , by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	and others , to the one quoted above ; but Professor
Earle	PERSON	, in '' The Philology of the English Tongue '' -LRB- third edition ,
Oxford	LOCATION	,
1879	DATE	, pp. 546-7 -RRB- has given to the public very distinct information as to New - man 's feeling concerning is being : '' From an early friend of Dr.
Newman	PERSON	's I learnt that he had long ago expressed a strong dislike to the cumulate form - ula is being .

		1 desired to be more particularly informed , and Dr.
Newman	PERSON	wrote as follows to his friend : ' It surprises me that my antipathy to is being existed so long ago .

		It is as keen and bitter now as ever it was , though I do n't pretend to be able to defend it .

		... Now I know nothing of the his - tory of the language , and can not tell whether all this will stand , but this I do know , that , rationally or irrationally , I have an undying , never-dying hatred to is being , whatever ar - guments are brought in its favour .

		At the same time I fully grant that it is so convenient in the present state of the lan - guage , that I will not pledge myself I have never been guilty of using it . ''

		Although I have noticed two instances -LRB- one in a let - ter -RRB- , besides the one cited above by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, where the '' imperfect passive '' was employed by Dr. New - man , yet I am confident that its use by him at least in print was very rare .

		Surprise which one feels at the weakness of the sup - port to be had from Dr.
Newman	PERSON	is increased by sur - prise from a different source when one compares with the quotation from '' Modern English '' given above Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's opinion of
Bishop Wilberforce	LOCATION	as shown in other parts of the same volume . ''

		Would that pessimists could learn to stifle their flatulent lamentations .

		Listen to another -LSB- Bishop Wilberforce -RSB- , one who , for all his unctuous clutter , is , certainly , the most me - chanical of contemporary prelates . ''

		-LRB- P. 290 , footnote . -RRB-

		And at page 48 Dr.
Hall	PERSON	pays this compliment to the Bishop 's English : `` The self-accommodating
Bp	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wilberforce , when , a few years ago , he wrote of ` the alone Saviour , ' was ridiculed , in that , when he cleansed his skirts of Low-churchism , he did not fully unlearn its characteristic jargon . ''

		Perhaps Dr.
Hall	PERSON	did not intend to include
Bishop Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- with Dr.
Newman	PERSON	-RRB- in '' some of the choic - est of living English writers '' ; but if he did not , page 329 needs amending .

		* Within its moderate scope and intention , Mr.
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	's '' From
Adam	PERSON	's Peak to Elephanta : Sketches in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	and
India	LOCATION	'' is decidedly the best book of recent East In - dian travel that has come to our notice .

		In addition to his series of brilliant pen-pictures of Oriental life and landscape , Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	offers us some instructive comment on current Indian questions , and his broader generaliza - tions touching the status and outlook of the Empire are pertinent and have an assuring ring of candor and mature conviction .

		To the rather hopeless social relations between
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indians and natives a separate chapter is de - voted , and the volume closes with a review of the '' Old Order '' of caste and communism , and of the working of the '' New Influences '' -LRB- chiefly Western science and commercialism -RRB- under whose solvent force old social and polit - ical growths now promise to disintegrate , agree - ably to the Spencerian formula .

		Religious topics are interestingly treated .

		We are af - forded a glimpse or two behind the scenes of the Hindu ritual , and the four expository chap - ters on the esoteric religious lore of South In - dia are the fruit of the author 's introduction into circles of traditional teaching usually closed against the English .

		We may note here , in passing , that while in
Madras	LOCATION	Mr. Car - penter visited Adyar , the Theosophist head - quarters . ''

		The Theosophist villa , with roomy lecture-hall and library , stands pleasantly among woods on the bank of a river and within half a mile of the sea .

		Passing from the library through sandalwood doors into an inner sanctum , I was shown a variety of curios connected with

		We shall confine our notice of the more pic - turesque portion of Mr.

		That the

		Touching the rite of bathing in the
Ganges	LOCATION	, the author observes : '' One might think that in order to induce people to bathe by thousands in muddy , half-stagnant water , thick with funeral ashes and drowned flowers , and here and there defiled by a corpse or a portion of one , there must be present an immense amount of religious or other fer - vor .

		One morning our author accompanied a Hindu friend , who wanted to bathe at a par - ticular ghaut , to the river-side .

		It was a
spring	DATE	festival , the ghauts were thronged , and charac - teristic scenes and objects were on every hand . ''

		As we approached the river the alleys began to get full of people coming up after their baths to the vari - ous temples pretty to see the women in all shades of tawny gold , primrose , saffron , or salmon-pink , bearing their brass bowls and saucers full of flowers , and a sup - ply of Ganges water . ''

		It was early
spring	DATE	, and a group of women coming up fresh from the water in their drip - ping garments were shivering in the chill air as they took their stand near by . ''

		Their long cotton clothes clung to their limbs , and I wondered how they would dress themselves under these conditions .

		The steps were reeking with wet and mud , and could not be used for sitting on .

		They man - aged , however , to unwind their wet things and at the same time to put on dry ones so deftly that in a short time and without any exposure of their bodies they were habited in clean and bright attire . ''

		In the course of the walk they came to one of the burning ghauts a sufficiently gruesome sight a blackened hollow running down to the water 's edge with room for three funeral pyres . ''

		As we stood there a corpse was brought down wrapped in an unbleached cloth -LRB- probably the same it wore in life -RRB- and slung beneath a pole which was car - ried on the shoulders of two men .

		Round about on the jutting verges of the hollow the male relatives sat perched upon their heels , with their cloths drawn over their heads spectators of the whole operation ... The body is placed upon the pyre , which generally in the case of the poor people is insufficiently large , a scanty supply of gums and fragrant oils is provided , the near - est male relative applies the torch himself and then there remains nothing but to sit for hours and watch the dread process , and at the conclusion , if the burning is complete , to collect the ashes and scatter them on the water , and if not , to throw the charred remains them - selves into the sacred river . ''

		While the author was taking note of this sick - ening business so hideously , not to say pro- fanely , suggestive , with its spices and aromat - ics , of cookery there appeared opportunely on the scene a self-mutilating fakir .

		This re - ligionist , scorning the lenten observances and mortifications of milder creeds , humored his amiable deity by holding the left arm uplifted in lifelong penance . ''

		There was no doubt about it ; the bare limb , to some extent dwindled , went straight up from the shoulder , and ended in a little hand , which looked like the hand of a child with fingers inbent and ending in long claw - like nails , while the thumb , which was disproportion - ately large , went straight up between the second and third fingers ... His extended right hand entreated a coin , which I gladly gave him , and after invoking some kind of blessing he turned away through the crowd his poor dwindled hand and half-closed fingers visible for some time over the heads of the people . ''

		Naturally , all this solemnity had its humor - ous interludes ; and the author was especially amused by the antics of a goat and a crow which knowingly stuck close to the altars and between them nibbled and nicked off the edible offerings as fast as the pious deposited them thereon .

		In his discussion of the Indian race-problem Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	is very frank and not at all optimistic .

		The sway of the Briton in a land he can not really inhabit , and over a swarming and potentially powerful race that is to him as oil is to water , is an anomaly .


John Bull	PERSON	in
India	LOCATION	is at best a sort of armed moderator , tolerated for the time because he measurably secures to the thrifty the fruits of their thrift , and restrains general throat-cutting .

		He does not like his position , but he accepts it , like old Mr.
Trapbois	PERSON	, '' for a consideration . ''

		Cer - tainly his '' subjects '' do not like him .

		Says a Hindu friend to our author : `` The vaunted administrative ability of the English is a fiction .

		They make good policemen and keep or - der when the people acquiesce that is all .

		If this acquiescence ceases , as it must , when the people rightly or wrongly believe their religion and family life in dan - ger from the government , the English must pack up and go , and woe to the English capitalist and profes - sional man . ''

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Between the Englishman and the native is a profound and impassable gulf of race differ - ence , of race dislike '' a deep-set ineradicable incompatibility . ''

		The primary point of view of each is impossible to the other .

		It is the old spiritual feud of Aristotelian and
Platon	PERSON	- ist the two great types , as
Leibniz	PERSON	said , of humanity .

		With the profoundly religious char - acter of the social system of
India	LOCATION	, the mate - rialistic spirit of English rule can not blend .

		What are the Englishman 's '' improvements , '' his railways and tanks and bridges , his five per cent , dividends even , to the mystical , mildly contemplative , apathetic Hindu , with his gaze fixed on Nirvana , and his scorn of the fleeting uses of a world that is to him an inn , a '' batter 'd
Caravanserai Whose Portals	ORGANIZATION	are alternate Night and Day . ''

		And on the other hand , what can the bustling , huckstering , eye-on-the-main-chance English - man , to whom metaphysic is a fable and barom - eters and microscopes are `` philosophical instru - ments , '' * whose religion is largely a matter of seventh-day observances , make of a man whose life is all religion , all metaphysic , who , as our author tartly puts it , '' Sits on his haunches at a railway station for a whole day meditating on the desirability of not being born again ! ''

		Truly , here is a pair of hopeless '' Incompat - ibles . ''

		Yet the Anglo-Indian , a mere drop in the ocean of latently-hostile native life about him , is apparently as unmindful of his position as he was up to the hour when the tragedy of '57 burst upon him , threatening to sweep him like thistle-down from the face of the land where -LRB- as we gather from our author -RRB- he snubs the natives socially , maltreats them officially , and , in short , fags and bullies his unresisting infe - riors in the good old
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	way .

		Says Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	: `` The most damning fact that I know against the average English attitude towards the natives is the fact that one of the very few places besides
Aligarh	LOCATION	, where there is any cordial feeling between the two parties , is
Hyderabad	LOCATION	a place in which , on account of its being under the
Nizam	LOCATION	, the officials are natives , and their position therefore prevents their being tram - pled on ! ''

		Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	dwells with apprehension on the fact that there are indications of an awaken - ing sense of nationality , of a dawning con - sciousness of their own strength , among the natives .

		While they will have none of the re - * As
Hegel	PERSON	notes with scorn in his Geschichte der Philos - ophic .

		ligion of their rulers , they profit by their polit - ical lessons .

		Prominent among the signs of the times is the
National Indian Congress	ORGANIZATION	an annual assemblage which brings together from
1000	DATE	to
1500	DATE	delegates from all parts of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		If the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	movement is destined to become a great political movement , it must , it seems to me , even - tuate in one of two ways either in violence and civil war , owing to determined hostility on the part of our
Government	ORGANIZATION	and the continual widening of the breach between the two peoples ; or which is more likely , if our government grants more and more representative power to the people in the immense growth of polit - ical and constitutional life among them , and the gradual drowning out of British rule thereby . ''

		There are other possibilities , as our author points out ; but they all , he holds , '' involve the decadence of our political power in
India	LOCATION	.

		... I can neither see nor imagine any other conclusion . ''

		From Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's account of Caste we shall allow ourselves one extract just pre - mising that when one reads that the Brahmans alone are subdivided into
1886	DATE	separate classes , the fearful complexity of the system is dimly apparent .

		* '' An acquaintance of mine in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	who belongs to the Vellala caste told me that on one occasion he paid a visit to a friend of his in
India	LOCATION	who belonged to the same caste but to a different section of it .

		They had a Brahman cook , who prepared the food for both of them , but who , being of a higher caste , could not eat after them ; while they could not eat together because they did not belong to the same section . ''

		Here was a problem to stagger the genius of a
McAllister	PERSON	.

		But the Brahman cook rose to the emergency .

		He '' ate his dinner first , and then served up the remainder separately to the two friends , who sat at different tables with a curtain hanging between them . ''

		In contrast to Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's thoughtful book is
Sara Jeannette Duncan	PERSON	's '' The Sim - ple Adventures of a
Memsahib	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A '' memsa - hib , '' we may say to those who have not read their Kipling , is a married woman more spe - cifically , we think , an English married woman .

		Our author has herself recently become a `` mem - sahib '' ; and the present volume is essentially an account of the early house-keeping trials of an inexperienced young wife in
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		The com plexities of house-furnishing , of the hiring and management of servants , of polyglot duels with the native shopmen -LRB- whose ways are decidedly not '' the ways of righteousness '' -RRB- , etc. , are de - * Dr.

		THE DIAL 113 tailed in a sprightly , superficial style , with a sprinkling of the smallest of small talk , and with a rambling volubility slightly suggestive of Mrs.
Nickleby	PERSON	.

		Incidentally , the reader is given a glimpse of
Calcutta	LOCATION	'' society '' and the glimpse is not a pleasing one .

		The vol - ume closes with the following picture of an evolved memsahib '' graduated , sophisticated , qualified '' : '' She has lost her pretty color , that always goes first , and has gained a shadowy ring under each eye , that always comes afterwards .

		She is thinner than she was , and has acquired nerves and some petulance ... To make up , she dresses her hair more elaborately , and crowns it with a little bonnet which is somewhat ex - travagantly ' chic . '

		She has fallen into a way of cross - ing her knees in a low chair that would horrify her
Aunt Plovtree	PERSON	, and a whole set of little feminine An - glo-Indian poses have come to her naturally ... Without being actually slangy , she takes the easiest word and the shortest cut in
India	LOCATION	we know only the necessities of speech , we do not really talk , even in the cold weather ... She is growing dull to
India	LOCATION	, too , which is about as sad a thing as any .

		She has ac - quired for the Aryan inhabitant a certain strong irri - tation , and she believes him to be nasty in all his ways .

		This will sum up her impressions of
India	LOCATION	years hence as completely as it does to-day .

		She is a memsahib like another . ''

		The book is very amusing , and offers a fresh disproof of the notion -LRB- started , probably , by some author of an unappreciated joke -RRB- that wo - men lack the sense of humor .

		Miss

		Eastward to the Land of the Morning , '' by

Ohio	LOCATION	man , is rather remarkable .

		Among the notable people met by Mr.

		Mr.

		THE WITCHCRAFT .

		* Dr.
Ernest Hart	PERSON	, well known to students of psychology , has written a timely work on ''
Hyp	PERSON	- notism , Mesmerism , and the New Witchcraft . ''

		The tendency of this very readable volume is admirable ; while recognizing the demonstrable and physiological phenomena of hypnotism , it opposes most vigorously and effectively the extravagant notions and pseudo-experiments which , in the name of hypnotic science , have been launched with much ceremony upon the reading public .

		This protest is especially time - ly , as the recent popular interest in hypnotism has been sustained and fostered distinctly more by the promises of demonstration of superna - tural effects than by an intelligent understand - ing of the specially psychological and scientific problems involved .

		Dr.
Hart	PERSON	devotes the most of his space to the consideration of the views and experiments of Dr.
Luys	PERSON	at the hospital of La Charite in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Luys	PERSON	's subjects claim to be sensi - tive to the action of a magnet , one pole attract - ing them and causing pleasant visions , while the other repels and gives rise to distressing emotions .

		Another specialty of these subjects is the externalization of sensation .

		The sub - ject becomes en rapport with an inanimate ob - ject .

		The favorite object is a doll that has been acted upon to secure the rapport ; if the doll be pinched , the subject feels the pain in the corresponding place .

		Dr.
Luys	PERSON	even has a skull-cap which , when placed upon the head of the subject , produces in her the somewhat incoherent mental notions of its former pos - sessor .

		These fantastic theories and observa - tions Dr.
Hart	PERSON	has most patiently refuted by a series of control experiments .

		With the aid of an electro-magnet it was clearly shown that the alleged effects appeared as readily when the current was off as when it was on , and always in response to a suggestion .

		When one thing was said while in reality the opposite was done by Dr.
Hart	PERSON	, the verbal suggestion was obeyed ; a false doll , not acted upon , ef - fected the alleged transfer of sensation quite as well as the true one .

		The following is a summary of some of the more interesting of the doll and magnet experiments : '' I had prepared an electro-magnet of considerable power , from which the current could be turned on or off with great rapidity by touching a button or by lifting the plates from the bath , or of course by detaching one or the other of the wires .

		I had also a bar of iron * HYPNOTISM , MESMERISM , AND THE NEW WITCHCRAFT .

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, resembling the magnetised bar which M. Luys had used , but which was not magnetic , a demagnetised magnet , and a set of needles variously and inversely magnetised .

		I had also two exactly similar wax dolls brought from a toy shop .

		... I signalled to the assistant , and told him to put on the current , whereupon he turned it off .

		Ac - customed , however , to believe that a magnet must be a magnet ,
Marguerite	PERSON	began to handle it .

		The note taken by Dr.
Sajous	PERSON	runs thus : ` She found the north pole , notwithstanding there was no current , very pretty ; she was , as it were , fascinated by it ; she caressed the blue flames , and showed every sign of delight .

		Then came the phenomena of attraction .

		She followed the magnet with delight across the room , as though fascinated by it .

		The bar was turned so as to present the other end , or what would be called , in the language of La Charite '' , the south pole ; then she fell into the attitude of repul - sion and horror , with clenched fists , and as it approached her she fell backward into the arms of
M. Cremiere	PERSON	, and was carried , still showing all the signs of terror and repulsion , back to her chair . '

		... Similar but false phenomena were obtained in succession with all the different forms of magnet and non-magnet .

		Marguerite was never once right ; but throughout , her acting was perfect ; she was utterly unable at any time really to dis - tinguish between a plain bar of iron , a demagnetised magnet , or a horse-shoe magnet carrying a full current , and one from which the current was wholly cut off . ''

		We took one of the dolls .

		We restored
Marguerite	PERSON	to the perfectly hypnotised condition , and when she was profoundly plunged in the state which is described as profound hypnosis , I placed a doll in her hand , which she held long enough to sensitise it .

		I then , taking the doll from her , rapidly disposed of it behind some books , and proceeded to operate on another doll which she had not touched and which I had just taken out of the box in which it came from the toy-shop .

		Holding her hand , I placed her in contact with Dr.
Sajous	PERSON	, that he might also be , to use the jargon of the school , en rapport with her , and I continued to hold her hand .

		If now I touched the hair of the doll , which she was sup - posed not to see , she exclaimed , according to my notes , ' On touche les cheveux , ' < On les tire , ' ' They are touching my hair they are pulling it , ' and as she complained it hurt her , we had to leave off pulling the doll 's hair .

		Taking the doll to a little distance , I pinched it ; she showed every sign of pain , and cried out , ' I do n't like to be hurt je ne veux pas qu ' on me fasse de mal . '

		I tickled the cheek of the figure ; she began to smile pleasantly . ''

		The supposed action of drugs at a distance proved to depend for its success upon delicate and unconscious suggestion . ''

		I put away the witness dolls , and we then proceeded to the effects of medicine tubes applied to the skin .

		I took a tube which was supposed to contain alcohol , but which did contain cherry laurel water .

		She immedi - ately began , to use the words of
M. Sajous	PERSON	's notes , to smile agreeably and then to laugh ; she became gay . '

		It makes me laugh , ' she said ; and then , ' I 'm not tipsy , I want to sing , ' and so on through the whole performance of a not ungraceful griserie , which we stopped at that stage , for I was loth to have the degrading performance of drunkenness carried to the extreme I had seen her go through at the Charite '' .

		I now applied a tube of alcohol , asking the assistant , however , to give me valerian , which no doubt this profoundly hypnotised subject perfectly well heard , for she immediately went through the whole cat performance I have already de - scribed as having been performed for my delectation by
Mervel	ORGANIZATION	, under the hands of Dr.
Luys	PERSON	, on the previous day .

		She spat , she scratched , she mewed , she leaped about on all fours , and she was as thoroughly cat-like as was Mervel on the previous and
Jeanne	PERSON	on the sub - sequent day .

		It would be tedious to go through the whole of the notes of the numerous sittings which I had with these five subjects , but I may say at once that we had the cat performance six times , twice with
Jeanne	PERSON	, twice with Vix , once with
Clarice	PERSON	, and once with Mervel .

		In no case by any accident was valerian used , but either sugar , alcohol , diabetic svigar , cherry laurel water , or distilled water ; nevertheless , the performance never failed when the subjects had reason to think it was ex - pected of them . ''

		In brief , we have here recorded another in - stance of a man of reputation being deceived by a shrewd anticipation of his unexpressed theories .

		It is certainly most unfortunate that experiments of this type have become identified with hypnotism , and it is to be hoped that this volume will contribute to a clearer perspective of the value of such research and a more whole - some direction of interest in phenomena of this kind .

		The one criticism that most students of hyp - notism would pass upon Dr.
Hart	PERSON	's views is that he undervalues the work done by the
Nancy	PERSON	school , and the application of hypnotism to medical practice .

		There is undoubtedly occa - sion for divergence of opinion on these points , but a somewhat more prominent and emphatic statement of the real contribution to the sub - ject would perhaps have been serviceable in preventing the notion , which a hasty reader might form , that all hypnotic research is value - less .

		But the provocation for a destructive criticism of certain studies in hypnotism has been so ample that a little overstatement is but natural .

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 taches to a book which is an autobiographic record of a half-century of public life in the leading Australian colony , written by the chief maker of Australian history probably the one politician of that new world who is as largely known to the American public as is
Frank Sla	ORGANIZATION	- vin or
Peter Jackson	PERSON	.

		For nearly forty years , as
Henry Parkes	PERSON	or Sir
Henry Parkes	PERSON	, he was a member of the Parliament of
New South Wales	LOCATION	, and was five times at the head of a lib - eral ministry .

		No more fascinating book than his has been published in recent times .

		The octogenarian statesman writes with the same audacious faith in himself which has always characterized his forty years of stormy polit - ical leadership , and gives blows with as sturdy a good-will as when he held command .

		One must not look here for a cool historical account of affairs in
New South Wales	LOCATION	.

		He must always remember that there is another side ; but Mr.
Francis	PERSON	in the '' Fortnightly Re - view , '' the special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' for
1893	DATE	, and Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	in his '' Problems of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	'' may all help to keep that in sight for the impartial ob - server .

		What one does find here is a wealth of details of political affairs in
Australia	LOCATION	to be read of nowhere else , and such an introduction to the personality of Australian governing cir - cles as can be given , probably , by no other pen .

		These pages , for their field , are as good as
Mozley	ORGANIZATION	's Reminiscences , or
Greville	LOCATION	's Memoirs , or the Journal of
Lord Loftus	PERSON	.

		Here , mingled with interesting reminiscences of
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Cobden	PERSON	and Bright , President
Arthur	PERSON	and
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, are delightful let - ters from
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Florence Nightingale	LOCATION	, sandwiched in with others of the highest im - portance with reference to constitutional law from authorities so eminent as
Alpheus Todd	PERSON	, Sir
T. Erskine May	PERSON	, Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	,
Lord Grey of Howick	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , better still , we are here introduced to Australian life in its infancy , and see it grow to a giant strength as it unfolds around this Homeric figure .

		From the deck of an emigrant ship we catch with him our first glimpse of
Australia	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	, seventeen years before the advent of responsible government , when
New South Wales	LOCATION	had little more than a hundred thousand of colonists and nearly one-third of these were transported convicts .

		Then it was known to the outer world almost solely as the purlieus of
Botany Bay	LOCATION	.

		With this still hale old man we see it set off , to the north and to the south , its two younger colo - nies ; and then come to have within its own borders a million of freemen , the majority of whom annually produce the largest wool crop in the world , while thousands of others are en - gaged with the product of the most prolific of silver mines .

		Sidney wool is as famous for its quality as is the Proprietary Mine at
Broken Hill	ORGANIZATION	for its quantity .

		Young in experience as
Australia	LOCATION	is , it has already given to the older world of its anti- podes the Torrens land registry system , the secret ballot , the closure , and the practical ap - plication of the eight-hour day .

		But not only in its suggestiveness to American politics is this newer Australian life of interest to us .

		This record by Sir
Henry Parkes	PERSON	is a record of the working out on parallel lines of many problems kindred to our own , and this fre - quently under the influence of our own national history .

		Among the most important questions are those of immigration , the tariff , and the disposal of public lands .

		The immigration controversy in
Australia	LOCATION	has gone through three stages , according as its subject has been the convict , the Chinaman , or the
Kanaka	LOCATION	.

		In his early days
Henry Parkes	PERSON	did good ser - vice , alongside the afterwards famous
Robert Lowe	PERSON	, and that pioneer Australian ,
William Charles Wentworth	PERSON	, in putting an end to the convict supply .

		In
1881	DATE	, and again in
1888	DATE	, he was largely instrumental in the passage of Chinese restriction acts curiously synchron - ous with our own exclusion legislation .

		Con - sistently with his record , he took only
last year	DATE	the same attitude in regard to the importation of
South Sea Islanders	LOCATION	, as an element detri - mental to the body politic .

		So in his earlier years , when the experiment of '' assisted '' im - migration from the sturdy working classes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	was being tried , he was strenuous for a proportion which should keep Saxon blood always to the fore .

		A homo - geneous self - controlled community has ever been his aim for the Australias .

		Again , along with Sir
John Robertson	PERSON	, he fought for years the battle of the humbler settler against the `` shepherd kings , '' the farmsteading against the ranche , until some approach to equal - ity of opportunity was at length obtained for the intending agriculturist .

		Again and again is reference found to our own system of land entry so far , more favorable to the home - steader .

		In the matter of the tariff ,
Parkes	PERSON	has always been a stanch free-trader , and with an interim of eight or nine years he has led the sentiment of his colony .

		In
1865	DATE	, however , and the date is interesting from a telepathic 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, point of view ,
New South Wales	LOCATION	adopted a protective tariff .

		In
1873	DATE	the free-traders re - turned to control ; but only two years ago Sir
Henry	PERSON	's last ministry was defeated through a coalition of the protectionists and the labor group , and in the
spring	DATE	of last year Mr.
Dibbs	PERSON	's ministry reverted to protection .

		To - day , nevertheless , public sentiment in the col - ony , as with us , trembles in the balance .

		It is interesting to see , in all these
Austra	LOCATION	- lian colonies , a generous pride in the associa - tion with
Great Britain	LOCATION	go hand-in-hand with a large-minded jealousy of anything like im - perial interference in their affairs .

		By the aid of this local independence , Sir
Henry	PERSON	has not yet succeeded in getting rid of the nomi - nee members of the upper house of the legis - lature , for whom his memoirs express scant re - spect .

		But it was during his first ministry that the imperial government in
1874	DATE	virtually conceded to the colonial ministry the full control of the pardoning power ; and his government , backed by the legislature , by res - olution and protest most heartily cooperated with
Queensland	LOCATION	in
1888	DATE	in her successful op - position to the appointment of a governor who was persona ingrata to a large section of her population .

		Only the other day , in deference to this sentiment , the imperial authorities noti - fied the government of
New South Wales	LOCATION	of their desire to appoint Sir
R. W. Duff	PERSON	to suc - ceed the retiring governor .

		The same spirit is manifest in the discussion of Australian as distinct from and even opposed to impe - rial federation , and is brought out in the cor - respondence in
1889	DATE	between
Parkes	PERSON	and
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- can
Gillies	PERSON	, the premier of
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Henry Parkes	PERSON	's name has been largely identified with this movement toward Australasian federation , although his own colony has held somewhat aloof until the trend as to some of the matters of detail shall be more clearly defined .

		When that much - to-be-desired union shall take place , the Australias will find some of the problems of an upper house , over which Sir
Henry	PERSON	has spent much thought , capable of an easier solu - tion .

		The author 's visits to the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	are interesting episodes in his agree - able narrative .

		His account of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, who , at a dining , '' spoke for six or seven min - utes with quiet fluency , and in clear finely-cut sentences of common-sense , '' was well worth re - cording .

		His mention of Governor
Carnell	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, whom he met more than once in the beginning of
1882	DATE	, makes one rub his eyes for a moment , till he discovers
Governor Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Funny is
Parkes	PERSON	's reply , in
1853	DATE	, to a speaker who challenged the patriotism of the makers of our Constitution by the criticism that their work was done behind closed doors . ''

		To a certain extent it might be true , '' is the rejoin - der , '' that the delegates sat with closed doors , for as it was cold in
America	LOCATION	, they probably did not leave them open . ''

		Curious is it , too , to read from the speech of one of the delegates to the
Federation Conference	ORGANIZATION	of
1890	DATE	, as quoted approvingly by
Parkes	PERSON	, that '' the Federal Par - liament ought to be empowered to cut up the larger colonies into smaller colonies , as the
Federal Government of America	ORGANIZATION	has cut up the larger States into smaller States when it has been deemed expedient and just to do so . ''

		Is this a generous induction from the solitary case of
West Virginia	LOCATION	?

		Inter arma silent leges .

		Many other portions of this prolonged and useful career might be dwelt upon such as Sir
Henry Parkes	PERSON	's agency in opening up the trans-Pacific Ocean route in connection with our first continental railway , his admirable sys - tem of public-school education , his local-option treatment of the liquor traffic , his industrial schools and hospital system .

		But enough has been said to induce to the reading of a most instructive volume , where , if the author has in truth written himself somewhat large , he has done it with that naive and unconscious sim - plicity of egoism which is charming because it is the product only of heroic epochs of the juventus mundi .

		Yet there is one essential difference between selec - tions from poetry and from prose .

		It is always possible in the case of poetry to select com - plete pieces which shall do ample justice to the merits of a poet , or even to choose passages from longer works that , because of some strik - ing description or episode , have a complete - ness in themselves .

		This is far from true of prose .

		It is not possible in the compass of such a volume as the present , giving extracts from the prose authors of two centuries , to print a single complete prose work , even a monograph or pamphlet ; while the nature of prose does not make it easy to select any short passage fully exemplifying the style of a prose writer .

		This depends on the fact that poetry is always a more concise form of expression than prose , and its flavor , so to speak , may be more easily perceived from a taste or two .

		In reality it would take twenty volumes of prose to give such a view of growth and development in English as might be given in a single vol - ume of poetry .

		For this reason , although it is inherent in the nature of poetry and prose and so not under the control of editor or critic , the volumes before us must inevitably suffer in comparison with the corresponding series .

		One other point deserves mention .

		The ed - itor of a volume of selections is most likely to err through including too many authors .

		Most of the collectors of prose have been especially liable to this criticism , and our editor is no ex - ception to the rule .

		For example , there are about forty poets in the first volume of Ward , ending with
Donne	PERSON	, who died in
1631	DATE	.

		In this first volume of English prose there are fifty-one for practically the same period .

		Had the number of authors been fewer , the selec - tions from the more important ones might have been longer and better .

		Moreover , this fact is especially emphasized when we compare the relative development of English poetry and prose .

		Modern poetry begins with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, and its second great exemplar died before
1600	DATE	.

		Modern prose of equal importance scarcely begins before
Milton and Dryden	PERSON	, neither of whom belongs to the present volume .

		Not - withstanding these criticisms , we gladly wel - come this important contribution to the history of English prose , and we shall look with inter - est for the later volumes , which will cover the more interesting periods of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .

		As in
Ward	LOCATION	's Poets , the critical introduc - tion to the prose writers are particularly inter - esting and valuable .

		Some of these are writ - ten by
Saintsbury	LOCATION	,
Hales	PERSON	,
Collins	PERSON	,
Ainger	ORGANIZATION	,
Ward	PERSON	, and
Gosse	PERSON	, besides the editor himself .

		The introduction to the whole volume is by Mr.
W. P. Ker	PERSON	, whose name also follows the largest number of critical notices .

		As to the former , one feels that scant justice is done to the ear - liest prose in the times of the great literary re - vivals under
Alfred	PERSON	and JElfric , compared with the later prose under
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		For it may certainly be said that the best prose of the pe - riods of Alfred and ^ Elfric is stronger and clearer than much of that written in the Mid - dle English period .

		Nor is it clearly set forth that the relation between the prose of
Alfred	PERSON	and the prose of
Mandeville	LOCATION	is a much more natural one than would be supposed from the exaggerated estimates of the influence of the Norman conquest .

		This is largely due to the fact that the English literary critic knows so little of the older period , and hence is not able to judge of what is original and what is ac - quired .

		Occasional points that might be improved occur in the critical notices preceding the se - lections from various authors .

		We might have a more exact statement as to the origin of
Mandeville	LOCATION	's travels , and some mention might have been made of Schbnborn 's important mon - ograph .

		Again , we have an occasional false note , as in the notice of
Cranmer	PERSON	, where Mr.
Collins	PERSON	has the following : '' He adjusted with exquisite tact and skill the
Saxon	PERSON	and Latin elements in our language , both in the ser - vice of rhythm and in the service of expression .

		He saw that the power of the first lay in terseness and sweetness , the power of the second in massiveness and dignity , and that he who could succeed in tempering artfully and with propriety the one by the other would be in the possession of an instrument which Isocrates and
Cicero	PERSON	might envy .

		He saw , too , the immense ad - vantage which the coexistence of these elements af - forded for rhetorical emphasis .

		And this accounts for one of the distinctive features of the diction of our lit - urgy , the habitual association of Saxon words with their Latin synonyms for purposes of rhetorical emphasis . ''

		Now there need be no hesitation in saying that this goes much too far with regard to
Cranmer	PERSON	or anyone else .

		In fact , one may assert , with - 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, out fear of successful refutation , that no writer of any age consciously chooses his words from the
Saxon	PERSON	and Latin or any other elements .

		What he does do is to choose from his own vo - cabulary , however required , words that seem to him strong or forcible , clear or concise , me - lodious or rhythmical , with little if any thought and often no knowledge of ultimate origin .

		One might as reasonably suppose the painter chooses his colors with some knowledge of their chemical composition , rather than because of their power to produce certain color effects .

		Moreover , an examination of the English Lit - urgy shows that the statement as to '' habitual association , '' etc. , is exaggerated and incorrect , although it has been so often repeated as to have apparently established itself .

		While noting these points of disagreement with the work before us , we have already ex - pressed a belief in its careful preparation and in its usefulness .

		These critical comments are added with the hope that they may be of bene - fit to those who use the book , not in any sense that they may prevent its use .

		It is to be hoped also that this new series of selections will stimu - late the study of English prose , which , compared with poetry , has been sadly neglected in the schools and we fear too often by English read - ers .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Exquisite re - ^ e ^ ave na -LRB- ^ frequent occasion to prints of classic praise the exquisite editions of En - English Action .

		v i i ii-i_ii glish classics published by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Few reprints of recent years have been as welcome as the Landor ,
Peacock	LOCATION	, and
Jane Austen	PERSON	, for which we are in - debted to these publishers .

		The convenient form of the volumes , the taste displayed in their typog - raphy , binding , and illustration , are features which must commend these editions to a wide circle of book-lovers ; while their inexpensiveness puts them within the reach of thousands to whom editions de luxe , in the ordinary sense , are inaccessible .

		The publishers of these books are now producing , in similar shape , editions of the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters and of the works of Fielding .

		The former of these edi - tions has already been mentioned in these pages , and we have now only to note the appearance of the '' Villette , '' which , like the ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' and the ''
Shirley	PERSON	, '' fills two of the pretty volumes .

		The edition of Fielding has just been started with ''
Jos	PERSON	- eph Andrews , '' in two volumes .

		It will be followed by ``
Tom Jones	PERSON	, '' `` Amelia , '' `` Jonathan Wild , '' and two volumes of Fielding 's miscellaneous writ - ings twelve volumes in all , the whole under the editorship of Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		The illus - trations , of which each volume is to have three or four , are the work of Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	and Mr.
E. J. Wheeler	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is to furnish each work with an introduction , and the prefatory chap - ter thus provided for ''
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	'' is in the happiest manner -LRB- or mannerism -RRB- of that accom - plished critic .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	considers ''
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	'' as having fceen suggested by the '' Pay - san Parvenu '' of
Marivaux	ORGANIZATION	quite as much as by
Richardson	PERSON	's ''
Pamela	PERSON	, '' which is perhaps stretch - ing a point .

		But Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is always thought - provoking , and nowhere more so than in his too brief introduction to the present volumes .


Herr Ziehen	PERSON	's `` Introduction to the A fanciful scheme - i - i - for the study of
Study of Physiological Psychology	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a clear presentation of the outlines of the science from the point of view of the reaction against
Herr Wundt	PERSON	, of which
Herr Miinsterberg	PERSON	is the best-known leader .

		All the ultimate problems of psychology are relegated to epistemology , or to a possible science of meta - physics , `` supposing it to exist '' ; and then every - thing else is made perfectly simple by means of neat little diagrams illustrating the origin , trans - formations , and associations of ideas in the brain .

		The diagrams are purely schematic and problem - atical .

		The hypothesis , for example , that pervades them all , of locally distinct sensory and memory cells , is by no means generally accepted by special - ists .

		But even a hypothetical anatomical scheme , the author contends , is of use as demonstrating the a priori possibility of his method , and relieving us of the '' fear '' of being compelled to have recourse to apperception , or will , or synthetic unity of con - sciousness , or some other mystic higher faculty .

		His schemes , he assures us , can all be easily readjusted as science progresses , and , whatever alterations be - come necessary , '' the fundamental conception that all processes of thought can be reduced psychologic - ally to the association of ideas will at all events en - dure . ''

		Into the merits of the controversy with
Herr Wundt	PERSON	it is impossible to enter here .

		Suffice it to say that he does not really break the continuity of mental development by the assumption of new mystic faculties of apperception , judgment , and will .

		Under these varying names he endeavors rather to trace throughout psychic life the fundamental uni - fying activity which the young psychologists in part dissimulate and in part relegate to epistemology .

		He attacks wherever he finds them the ultimate metaphysical problems which they evade and post - pone .

		To determine whether this means more than a difference of method or exposition would require a much more elaborate dialectic than either side has yet brought to bear upon the controversy .

		In any case , the present brief intelligible exposition of one view of the matter is welcome .

		The translation , by Mr.
C. C. Van Liew	PERSON	and Dr.
Otto W. Beyer	PERSON	, is substantially correct , but stiff , inelegant , and con - taminated with German idiom .

		THE DIAL 119 Mr.
Maine	PERSON	's literary essays , Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	's '' Essays in Lit - erary Interpretation '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- are eight in number , and are character - ized by sanity , grace , and the philosophic temper .

		Two of them set forth the complexity of modern lit - ei * ature and the irreducible personal element which , in all great work , baffles the academic critic .

		A third discusses criticism itself , for the purpose of emphasizing the significant aspects of the art in its modern development .

		The critic has mainly to do with '' the men whose inferiority to Homer and
Dante	PERSON	, to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	, is clearly appar - ent , '' says Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	.

		This is , of course , true , but we fail to understand to whom the succeeding sen - tence refers : '' These illustrious shades have re - ceived but a single comrade into their immortal fel - lowship during the present century . ''

		Is it Goethe or Shelley or Hugo or Tennyson ?

		Competent opin - ion declares for each or all of these names , and Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	should have specified , although later passages make it probable that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is meant .

		According to Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	, plasticity and the historical method give to modern criticism its distinctive character .

		Four of these essays are studies of as many poets
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		They well illustrate the author 's own views of modern criti - cism , for each displays the special quality of sym - pathy that its subject calls for , and each takes ade - quate account of the poet 's environment .

		The essay on
Rossetti	PERSON	has one or two slips :
1876	DATE	, instead of
1870	DATE	, is given as the date of
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Poems , '' and '' The Bride 's Prelude '' is omitted from the enumeration of his ballads .

		ened by the examples of his correspondence given us in this welcome little volume .

		A sympathetic biography of Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	.

		The '' Recollections of Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which are given us , with a selection from
Brown	PERSON	's correspondence , by Dr.
Alexander Peddie	PERSON	, afford a sketch , rather than a finished portrait , of the genial historian of '' Rab '' and ''
Marjorie Fleming	PERSON	. ''

		The author was intimately acquainted with
Brown	PERSON	, whom he calls '' my revered master and nearly lifelong friend , '' and his book is sympathetic , if fragment - ary .

		It keeps us constantly in mind of the fact that
Brown	PERSON	was primarily a man of medicine , and but secondarily a man of letters that his literary recreations were indeed , as their title indicates , products of his '' Horse Subsecivae , '' rather than the serious work of his life .

		In fact , his appearance in literature was rather accidental , resulting from
Hugh Miller	PERSON	's invitation to contribute to the '' Wit - ness '' some notices of the pictures in the Scottish Academy exhibition of
1846	DATE	.

		His first thought was to decline the request -LRB- which was accompanied by a bank note -RRB- , `` had not my sine qud non , with wife-like government , retentive and peremptory , kept the money and heartened me . ''

		The book has a number of interesting illustrations , which include portraits and facsimile letters , the latter ornamented with rough drawings .

		Brown reminds one not a little , in character and originality , of the late Ed - ward
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, and this impression is strength - A ^ factory Sir
Arthur Gordon	PERSON	's The Earl of biography of the Aberdeen '' -LRB- `` The Queen 's Prime een ' Ministers , ''
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a satisfactory piece of biography , considering the narrow compass to which the volumes of the series are confined .

		The delineation of so finely shaded a character would not , in any circumstances , be an easy task ; and the fact that
Lord Aberdeen	PERSON	's public , like his private life , was , generally speaking , comparatively hidden , renders it still more difficult .

		His pre - miership shows none of the histrionic climaxes and situations that mark that of a Disraeli .

		There was little in his public career to dazzle the spectator , or to command instant or excessive admiration ; and neither his mental powers nor rare personal charm can now be fairly appreciated , except by those who , like the author of this book , lived in close personal intercourse with him , and have had access to the mass of his correspondence , public and private .

		The author is to be especially commended , in view of his relationship to
Lord Aberdeen	PERSON	, for the tact and sobriety of judgment everywhere manifest in his work .

		: A very valuable addition to the '' In - Greek and Latin tern ational Scientific Series '' -LRB- Ap - Palceography .

		, , < r TT j pleton -RRB- takes the shape of a '' Hand - book of Greek and Latin Palaeography , '' by Dr.
Edward Maunde Thompson	PERSON	, of the British Mu - seum .

		Photography has done so much in recent years for the study of palaeography that the sub - ject is practically brought within the reach of any who care to take it up .

		To such this book is ad - dressed .

		It gives us a history of the Greek and Latin alphabets , an account of the materials used to receive writing , chapters on writing instruments , the forms of books , and abbreviations , and , finally , an extended history of the development of Greek and Latin writing , with many facsimile illustrations from the earliest to the latest periods .

		The work is singularly compact , and provides a satisfactory in - troduction to the study of its important subject . ''

Gordy	PERSON	and
W. I. Twitchell	PERSON	, is one of those useful , or rather indispensable , books for teachers that recent years have so greatly mul - tiplied .

		It suggests methods of instruction for all grades , including the youngest ; it outlines the treat - ment of selected typical subjects ; it gives extensive lists of books for reference and for supplementary reading .

		The references , which are in most cases not merely to the book , but to chapter and page , will be found extremely helpful by students and teachers alike , while they represent , on the part of the authors , many years of reading and .

		We give the book a hearty welcome , and pre - dict for it a long career of usefulness .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, The Bancroft Company send us the first installment of their Book of the Fair , a forty-page folio , to be followed by twenty-four similar semi-monthly parts .

		The complete work will thus make a folio volume of a thousand pages , and these will be adorned , we are told , by more than three thousand illustrations .

		The part now published contains a chapter on '' Fairs of the Past , '' a historical sketch of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the beginning of a chapter on '' The Evolution of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Hubert Howe Bancroft	PERSON	is the writer of the text , and is peculiarly competent to deal with so large a subject , although his style occasionally suffers from magniloquence .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		MR.
Arnold H. Heinemann	PERSON	has edited a selection of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's letters -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , not printed hereto - fore , and now reproduced in a very free sort of trans - lation or paraphrase .

		The publication is sanctioned by
Frau Froebel	PERSON	, who is still living which may be news to some at the age of seventy-eight .

		The editor con - tributes some notes to the work , and a certain amount of comment upon
Froebel	PERSON	's theories of education .

		The book will be welcome to kiudergartners , and , indeed , to all who are concerned in the education of children .

		OUR veteran lepidopterist , Mr.
Samuel H. Scudder	PERSON	, has recently prepared two books about butterflies that will be found very helpful to youthful readers and stu - dents .

		One of them , '' The Life of a Butterfly , '' takes a single species -LRB- Anosia plexippus -RRB- for a text , and dis - courses upon the structure , habits , and life-histories of butterflies in general .

		The other book is a little more pretentious , being a `` Brief Guide to the Commoner Butterflies of the
Northern United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		It classifies the common species , to the number of about a hundred , giving their life-histories , and provides ana - lytical keys , suggestions for reading , and directions for field and cabinet work .

		It is in every respect an ad - mirable little book , and ought to have a wide circula - tion .

		Both volumes are published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE Making of a Newspaper '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a scrappy book , edited by Mr.
Melville Philips	PERSON	, and con - sisting of a dozen or more articles upon various phases of newspaper production .

		It is intended '' to afford the public a close and comprehensive view of various phases of newspaper life and work . ''

		While the view thus afforded is undeniably '' close , '' we can hardly say that it is `` comprehensive , '' for it is illustrated with too much of anecdote and random comment to leave room for the desirable amount of exact description .

		PROFESSOR
T. F. Tout	PERSON	's Edward the First '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- almost completes the series of '' Twelve En - glish Statesmen , '' but one volume Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's `` Chat - ham '' remaining to be published .

		Professor Tout gives us a straightforward narrative of the reign of the great statesman-king .

		His work , while not brilliant , is perspicuous and scholarly , and comes quite up to the high general average of the series within which it is comprised .

		DR.
James Dwight	PERSON	's little book on '' Practical Lawn - Tennis '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is full of suggestions by which even an experienced player may profit , while for the begin - ner it affords all the necessary directions and rules .

		The most interesting feature of the book , however , is found in the illustrations , from instantaneous photo - graphs by Mr.
Francis Blake	PERSON	, which represent the ten - nis player in a great variety of typical positions .

		So brief has been the exposure given these photographs , that the ball is defined with perfect sharpness , although in many cases it is just leaving the bat .

		A VOLUME of '' Other Essays from the Easy Chair '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- affords pleasant desultory reading .

		The es - says chosen range over many subjects , from nominating conventions to the idiosyncrasies of the hog family , and include semi-biographical studies of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Beecher	PERSON	, and
Sherman	PERSON	.

		Some of the selections date back many years , as we discovered when we came upon the state - ment that Vice-Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	have thrice succeeded to the Presidential chair .

		Either the essays should have been dated , or editorial care should have seen to the correction of such statements .

		In - stead of these instructive themes , the writer has chosen to discourse upon street scenes and village manners , upon the snipe and the capercailzie , and upon the for - tunes of the angler and the bear-hunter .

		The book is as entertaining as it is unpretentious , and will appeal strongly to all lovers of out-door life .

		Tliere is very little of the rhapsodical about Mr.
Adolph Carpi	PERSON	's '' The Pianist and the Art of Music '' -LRB-
Lyon & Healy	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which we find to be a schol - arly and suggestive work .

		It is strictly what it claims to be , '' a treatise on piano-playing for teachers and stu - dents , '' and its closing '' Outline of Piano Literature '' is an admirable historical presentation of the subject .

		THE '' Memories of Dean Hole '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been reviewed at great length in
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, and we now mention it to call attention to the new and cheaper edition in which it is offered to the public .

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of a pleasing volume of popular science by Miss

		It marshals many of the curiosities of botanical science for the information of the beginner , and is written in fairly popular style , although unhesi - tating use is made , when necessary , of scientific termin - ology .

London	LOCATION	`` Academy '' : '' A well-known scholar and man of letters has sent the following jeu d'esprit to Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, on hearing the news that the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	has at last got through the letter C , and that D is now in hand : ' Wherever the English speech has spread , And the Union
Jack	PERSON	flies free , The news will be gratefully , proudly read That you 've conquered your ABC !

		But I fear it will come As a shock to some That the sad result must be That you 're taking to dabble and dawdle and doze , To dulness and dumps , and -LRB- worse than those -RRB- To danger and drink , And shocking to think To words that begin with a d . ' ''

		This is the jubilee year of the great publishing house of
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, their first book having appeared in
1843	DATE	.


Daniel Macmillan	PERSON	was the founder of the house , which first did business in
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		He soon removed to
London	LOCATION	, and then to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, his brother Alexander being associated with him .

		The former died in
1857	DATE	, but the latter still lives as the senior member of the firm .

		In
1863	DATE	the headquarters of the firm was 122 -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, transferred to
London	LOCATION	, and the
Cambridge	LOCATION	business came into the hands of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	and Bowes , a distinct firm .

		In
1859	DATE	''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine '' was started .

		From
1863	DATE	to 1880 Mr.
A. Macmillan	PERSON	was official pub - lisher to the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1867	DATE	he vis - ited this country , and the result of the visit was the establishment , in
1869	DATE	, of a branch house in
New York	LOCATION	, under the management of Mr.
George E. Brett	PERSON	.

		On Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's death , in
1890	DATE	, the
New York	LOCATION	branch be - came an independent firm , with Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	, his son , as the resident American partner .

		The firm has just moved into its new building at No. 66 Fifth Avenue .

		The present members of the
London	LOCATION	firm are Messrs.
Alexander	PERSON	,
Frederick	PERSON	,
George	PERSON	, and
Maurice Macmillan	PERSON	, and Mr.
George L. Craik	PERSON	.

		American authors figure largely in the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	catalogue , which , car - ried down only to
1889	DATE	, fills an octavo volume of 568 pages .

		It includes , as everyone knows , many of the greatest names in modern English literature .

		The following letter , written by Mr.
Alfred B. Ma	PERSON	- son to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Critic , '' has more than a local application . ''

		The
Sculpture Society	ORGANIZATION	is prematurely born .

		The hopes , the efforts , the money which it will absorb should be con - centrated on an older and more modest organization the Iconoclast Society .

		It is our purpose to destroy the chief hor - rors of existence in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		We propose , first , to blow up with suitable ceremonies a certain -LRB- or uncertain -RRB- cockchafer impaled on a pin -LRB- see
Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary : ' Cockchafer , an animal unlike anything else on earth ' -RRB- , which disfigures
Washington Square	LOCATION	and has been labelled '
Gari	PERSON	- baldi ' by some hater of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		We shall then remove with proper violence a statue on the east side of
Central Park	LOCATION	which represents a forgotten retail clothier named
S. F. B. Morse	PERSON	in the act of offering for sale to the passer-by a ' gent 's shawl , rich and dressy . '

		St.
Andrew	PERSON	's Day is to be celebrated by the obliteration of a misshapen bronze lump marked '
Burns	PERSON	, ' which now makes walking on the Mall im - possible for all but the blind and the very young .

		Until the
Iconoclast Society	ORGANIZATION	by a judicious combination of good taste and gunpowder has thus wrought its perfect work and freed the city from these and the kindred monsters which squat darkly in our parks , there can be no public taste for the
Sculpture Society	ORGANIZATION	to develop and satisfy . ''

		We should like to see a branch of the Iconoclast Soci - ety established in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and it might very fittingly inaugurate its crusade by the removal , with `` proper violence , '' of the bronze statue , alleged to be of
Christo	ORGANIZATION	- pher
Columbus	LOCATION	, which the directors of the World 's Fair have erected upon our Lake Front .

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's new book is a worthy sequel to his great masterpiece , '' Kidnapped . ''

		It is more than a story of romantic adventure , with conspiracies and perils and heroic achievements on land and sea , for it makes
David	PERSON	the hero of a love affair , the description of which reveals the author 's genius in an altogether new light .

		The Adventures of
David	PERSON	and his
Highland	LOCATION	sweetheart carry them both into
Holland	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and supply fresh evidence of the author 's wonderful power of spirited narrative and bold character painting .

		Master of words !

		thine was the perfect art To catch the living phrase , no coin of thought , But thought 's bright self , that , clear and roundly wrought , Distinct in air and sunshine , sends a start Of fresh delight through the worn sense .

		Apart From common ways of fumbling speech , where naught Rings true , thy crystal bells pure-toned are fraught With bliss for thrilling nerves ... But for the heart ?

		Potent the flow : nor flashing , pouting smiles Of Millamant can witch away the shame And hardness of her world .

		Yet while we blame , While our need craves some sterner , sweeter bard Whose trumpet-cry more than all joy beguiles , Thy keen truth leaps to flame , and night is starred !


MARIAN MEAD	PERSON	.

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		A considerable portion of the space in this issue of THE DIAL is devoted to the regular annual list of classified announcements of forth - coming books .

		The list is a long one and would have been much longer had it not been thought best to exercise a certain discrimina - tion and to omit many titles of minor interest .

		It is believed that everything of real import - ance thus far definitely included in the an - nouncements of American publishers will be found comprised .

		Certainly , the list offers no evidence that the general commercial depres - sion of recent months has extended to the pub - lishing business ; it rather indicates , if any - thing , that the business has made more exten - sive plans and assumed a broader scope than usual .

		It is , however , true that the effects of commercial depression would require some time to become manifest in publishers ' lists .

		Books are taken in hand long before they are pub - licly announced , and the close of one season finds the work of the next well under way .

		In the department of historical literature , several noteworthy works are promised .

		Per - haps the most important are a work on
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	; a study in geographical discovery in the interior of
North America	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Justin Winsor	PERSON	; a history of the English town in the fifteenth cen - tury , by
Miss Alice Stopford Green	ORGANIZATION	; and a three-volume translation of the memoirs of the Chancellor Pasquier .

		In biography , we must mention first of all the life of
Lowell	LOCATION	which Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	has been writing for the '' American Men of Letters '' series .

		The author is sure to bring both scholarship and literary grace to the work , and we will not quarrel with the fact that the biography is to fill two volumes , although such extended treat - ment is probably disproportionate to the scope of the series .

		While on the subject of
Lowell	LOCATION	, we must not forget to mention the two prom - ised volumes of letters , edited with loving care by Professor
Norton	PERSON	.

		Other promised biog - raphies are a life of
Jared Sparks	PERSON	, by Profes - sor
Herbert B. Adams	PERSON	; of Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
K. E. Prothero	PERSON	; of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, by Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	; of
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Edmund Sheridan Purcell	PERSON	; of William 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	.

		Jay , by Mr.
Bayard Tuckerman	PERSON	; and the au - tobiography of Signer Salvini .

		Among works of general literature the first place must be given to the familiar letters of
Scott	LOCATION	, edited by Mr.
David Douglas	PERSON	; and to Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's volume of Turn bull lectures upon classical Greek poetry .

		We are to have the works of
George William Curtis	PERSON	and of
Thomas Paine	PERSON	two very unlike worthies each in four volumes ; the one edited by Pro- fessor
Norton	PERSON	, and the other by the Rev.
M. D. ` Conway	PERSON	.

		We are also to have a new volume of papers by
Emerson	LOCATION	, most of which have seen the light in the magazines .

		The letters of Asa trray will have much more than a scientific in - terest , and will fill two volumes .

		Pleasing , at least , will be the volumes of essays by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	and
Miss Agnes Repplier	PERSON	, and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's additional '' Letters to Dead Au - thors . ''

		The announcements in poetry and fiction are so numerous that we hardly know where to stop in our selection , although it is easy to begin , in the one class , with
Parsons	PERSON	's poems and trans - lation of
Dante	LOCATION	; in the other , with the ''
Pan Michael	ORGANIZATION	'' of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, which will com - plete the great historical trilogy of the Polish novelist .

		Volumes of new verse are promised by Mr.
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
Bliss Cf.rman	PERSON	, the Rev.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, Professor
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, and Miss
Mary Robinson	PERSON	, besides Professor Gold - win
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's collection of translations from the Latin poets .

		In fiction , we may soon expect '' The Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	; '' His Vanished Star , '' by Miss Murfree ; '' The Copperhead , '' by Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	; '' The White Islander , '' by Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	; '' Ma - rion Darche , '' by Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	; and '' A Gen - tleman of
France	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Stanley J. Wey	PERSON	- man .

		In art , the most interesting announcements are a volume of cats in photogravure , by Mad - ame
Ronner	PERSON	, who has made the expression of feline character quite her own province ; a sumptuous work on French illustrators , by
M. Louis Morin	PERSON	; a great work on
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, by
M. Emile Michel	PERSON	; and a portfolio of proofs from '' The Century . ''

		Serious travel will be represented by Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's work on Eskimo life and the late Professor
Freeman	PERSON	's studies of travel in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In lighter vein , we are sure to find enjoyment in Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's '' An Embassy to
Provence	LOCATION	, '' in Miss
Margaret Symonds	PERSON	's Lombard sketches , in Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's '' On Sunny Shores , '' and in Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's '' Glimpses of
Unfamiliar Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Educators will be glad to find collected into a volume Dr.
J. M. Rice	PERSON	's '' Forum '' articles on the public schools of our large cities , and will welcome the extensive lists of text-books of - fered in all departments by several publishing firms .

		In economics , the most important an - nouncement appears to be Professor
John S. Nicholson	PERSON	's history of political economy .

		In the other departments , our list must be left to speak for itself .

		There will clearly be no dearth of new works upon science , philoso - phy , and religion ; no lack of choice among books for holiday gifts or of literature for youth - ful readers .

		The latter categories , indeed , are already bewildering in the variety that they in - clude , but still additional announcements may be expected during the coming weeks .

		A FRENCH VIEW OF AMERICAN COPYRIGHT .

		We mentioned , some time ago , the `` Note sur 1 ` Acte du 3 Mars ,
1891	DATE	, '' printed in pamphlet form by the French Syndicat pour la Protection de la Proprie ` te ' Litte ` raire et Artistique , and sent by that body as its contribution to the proceedings of the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another mark of French in - terest in the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	takes the shape of a lengthy communication from
the Association Litte	ORGANIZATION	` raire et
Artistique Internationale	ORGANIZATION	, also sent to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, although addressed in form to the President of the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	.

		We subjoin a trans - lation of the more important passages of this com - munication .

		After the usual preliminary salutations , accompanied by congratulations upon the work al - ready done by the
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, the letter proceeds to comment upon the Law of
1891	DATE	: '' The American law , by its recognition of the rights of authors during a period of forty-two years , has sanc - tioned intellectual property in an excellent manner , and although , in most European countries , these rights are protected for a minimum period of fifty years after the death of the author , we do not think that a modifica - tion of the law in this respect should be urged .

		But the question is different when we come to consider the formalities to be complied with .

		You are aware that all our efforts are directed towards the recognition of intellectual property without the necessity of complying with any formalities .

		In
France	LOCATION	, for example , the right comes into existence ipso facto with the act of pub - lication , no registration being necessary .

		If registra - tion is made at the
Department of the Interior	ORGANIZATION	, it is considered merely as an administrative formality , and its omission neither lessens nor weakens the right of ownership . ''

		In the
United States	LOCATION	such registration has been deemed necessary to the very existence of the right of ownership .

		We can only bow to the will of the legis - lator , which seems , however , to have exceeded its limits when , in the case of works by foreign authors , it has added to the registration clause the obligation of re -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 manufacture upon American soil , with American type and paper . ''

		We understand clearly the nature of the consider - ations that have impelled the legislator to protect a na - tional industry by reserving to American printers a monopoly of the manufacture of books circulating in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		But , setting aside the question of books published in the English language , we venture to observe that , as far as it concerns books published in French , Italian , Spanish , German , or other languages , the manufactur - ing clause acts adversely to the object proposed .

		`` In fact , the considerable expense that it imposes upon foreign authors constitutes an almost insurmount - able obstacle to their claim of the right which the law concedes . ''

		It is clearly the interest of American publishers to secure , at a low cost , the ownership of works pub - lished in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But every contract made by them with a foreign author is heavily handicapped by the pre - liminary manufacturing clause . ''

		Yet the intention of the legislator to recognize the rights of the foreign author is very distinctly expressed .

		How did it come about that he at the same time made the exercise of those rights almost impossible ?

		Would it not have been more logical to prohibit the importa - tion into the
United States	LOCATION	of all translations manufac - tured abroad ?

		In this way the monopoly of manufac - ture would remain with the American publishers and printers .

		The foreign author would register his work at the
Washington	LOCATION	library , and this registration would form the basis of the contract to be made between him and the American publisher , the latter being guaranteed against competition by his inalienable right to the mate - rial manufacture of the translation upon American soil . ''

		We believe this to be the path that the legislator should take .

		With music and the graphic arts , likewise , it seems to us that it should suffice -LRB- the work being registered , and two copies manufactured in the country of its origin being deposited at
Washington	LOCATION	-RRB- to reserve to American publishers the monopoly of re-manufacture upon American soil , a contract having been made with the author . ''

		It would be preferable , indeed , that the free circu - lation of intellectual works were assured throughout the whole world , but it is not for us to dictate to the
United States	LOCATION	a rule of conduct in a matter of which they alone must judge .

		We merely seek a modus vivendi , appli - cable to , yet improving , the present situation . ''

		We beg also to call your attention to the wellnigh insurmountable difficulties arising from the legal re - quirement of registration at
Washington	LOCATION	on the very day of publication in the original country .

		Questions of distance play such a part in the relations of
Europe	LOCATION	with the
United States	LOCATION	that we need not insist upon a point so obvious .

		The legislative condition of registra - tion at
Washington	LOCATION	would be fulfilled even if foreign authors were to be granted a month or two of grace .

		We believe that this modification , based upon logic and the force of circumstances , would not meet with serious opposition . ''

		The letter closes with the expression of a wish that the French Society might enter into closer and more continuous relations with the American Copy - right League , and with an invitation to take part in the proceedings of the
International Literary and Artistic Congress	ORGANIZATION	to be held at
Barcelona	LOCATION	, and opened the twenty-third of this month .

		IBSEN 'S TREATMENT OF SELF - ILLUSION .

		In no play of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's is the corrosive self-destroy - ing character of his social criticism more apparent than in '' The Wild Duck . '' ''

		A Doll-House '' and '' The Pillars of Society '' enforced the lesson that unless there be truth in personal and social rela - tions they can not endure ; they are built upon sand , and can not brave the shocks of adversity .

		This was perhaps the first positive lesson to be derived from
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's teachings .

		We felt that here we had at last firm ground under our feet ; and
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's pertinent query , '' What is truth ? ''

		we left prelim - inarily in abeyance .

		But no sooner have we opened `` The Wild Duck '' than we find the earth rocking and heaving in the most uncomfortable man - ner .

		That which we mistook for rock was after all nothing but quagmire . ''

		The Wild Duck '' teaches us that the truth is by no means an unqualified boon .

		It takes a strong spirit to endure it .

		To small , com - monplace men , living in mean illusions , the truth may be absolutely destructive .

		It is better for such people to be permitted to cherish undisturbed their little lies and self-deceptions than to be brought face to face with the terrifying truth , lacking , as they do , both the courage and the strength to grap - ple with it and to readjust their lives to radically altered conditions .

		It appears to me as if
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	had undertaken to satirize himself in this play . ''

		I have told you be - fore that you must above all be truthful , '' he seems to say ; '' that you must live your individual lives , and refuse to adapt yourselves to the code of con - duct of your Philistine neighbors ; that you must drain , if necessary , the wholesome cup of woe that is put to your lips , and rise through suffering to a higher and nobler manhood and womanhood .

		But if you have been innocent enough to take me at my word in these injunctions , I now find that they stand in need of revision .

		It is not improbable that you may be too paltry to be benefited by such heroic diet , in which case I advise you to ignore what I have said and remain in your old slough of pusillani - mous mendacity and contentment . ''

		This is the obvious moral of '' The Wild Duck , '' if a moral it can be called .

		The situation is as fol - lows :
Hjalmar Ekdal	PERSON	, a photographer in a small town , is a lazy , miserable good-for-nothing , but with a taste for theatrical phrase-making and grand atti - tudes .

		He lives a sort of heroic dream-life , de - voting himself , in fancy at least , to the perfecting of a great invention , about which he talks a great deal , without , however , making any visible progress .

		By means of the fame which will come to him from this beneficent enterprise , he intends to obliterate the disgrace which has befallen his father , and vin - dicate the family honor .

		The elder Ekdal , an ex - lieutenant and lumber speculator , has been sentenced to the penitentiary for violation of the forestry laws , and , after having served out his sentence , is now 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, living with his son .

		He earns a little money by copying documents for his former partner , the man - ufacturer
Werle	PERSON	, and promptly gets drunk on part of the proceeds of his industry .

		He is half in his dotage , and utterly devoid of all sense of honor .

		In the loft of the house he has arranged a sort of mock-forest , consisting of some old Christmas trees , in the branches of which hens and pigeons roost .

		Here he has also collected some rabbits , and amuses himself by firing at them with a pis - tol and a gun which always clicks .

		From the ser - vants of
Werle	PERSON	he has obtained a wild duck , which , after having been wounded by their master , had been retrieved by his dogs .

		Hedwig , his grand - daughter , a little girl of fourteen , takes a great fancy to this wild waterfowl , and daily spends Chappy hours in the dark loft , watching the rabbits and the pigeons .

		Her father ,
Hjalmar	PERSON	, though he makes a pretence of being deeply absorbed in sci - entific meditation , is rarely averse to indulging in the same sport as his parent ; and in fact the only member of the family for whom the loft has no at - traction is his wife
Gina	PERSON	, who , by her attention to the housekeeping as well as the photographic busi - ness , is the mainstay and support of her husband , daughter , and father-in-law .

		She is a simple , un - reflecting creature , and is therefore easily imposed upon by
Hjalmar	PERSON	's theatricals .

		She honestly be - lieves him to be the remarkable genius he pro- claims himself to - be , misunderstood and disdained by the world , but bound to shed his chrysalis some day and rise into the air as a golden butterfly .

		She had in her maiden days been a servant in
Werle	LOCATION	's employ , and the marriage had , in fact , been arranged by the great manufacturer .

		There was a rumor afloat that she had also been his mistress ; but if it had ever reached
Hjalmar	PERSON	's ears , he magnan - imously ignored it .

		Now all these people are living more `` or less sor - did lives , but each one is happy in his particular illusion .

		Ekdal hunts imaginary bears in an im - aginary forest , and gets drunk as often as he can af - ford it .

		If he dreams of the contempt with which he is regarded , he is not in the least troubled by it .

		Hjalmar glories in being a misunderstood genius , poses as a model husband , son , and father , and though the very incarnation of ruthless selfishness , drapes himself most successfully in a garb of virtue , as substantial as the Emperor 's new clothes in
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	's story .

		His daughter takes all his fine phrases at their face value , and while she wears out her little life retouching photographs for him , is greatly moved and edified by his magnanim - ity .

		He knows that she is losing her eye-sight , and makes pathetic speeches about her gliding into the eternal night , but it does not occur to him to re - lieve her of her labor .


Gina	PERSON	, finally , is contented enough , after her fashion , because she demands but little of life , and has too blunt a conscience to be troubled by her past delinquency as long as it is safely hidden .

		Into the midst of this peaceful circle drops one day
Gregers Werle	PERSON	, a son of the manufacturer and a former schoolfellow of
Hjalmar	PERSON	.

		He knows the true state of affairs , and regards it as a sacred duty to reveal to his friend the ignominy in which he is living .

		He has been dazzled by his grand professions , which he takes for good coin .

		He be - lieves that a relation founded upon a lie can never be a happy one ; and persuades himself that the truth , under all circumstances , is wholesome and purifying .

		Hjalmar and
Gina	PERSON	, standing , as it were , soul to soul , stripped of their false draperies , will , he thinks , find each other and be united in a true and ideal marriage .

		But in these suppositions he reckons without his host .

		The photographer , when he learns of his wife 's former liason and the paternity of his supposed child , is not so very deeply shocked ; nay , at bottom , perhaps , he is nearly in - different .

		But he knows what is expected of him in such a moment ; and he casts about him for a truly heroic part .

		He must justify
Gregers	PERSON	's opin - ion of him , and the demands of his own dignity .

		So he summons his wife , and in lofty phrases cate - chizes her concerning her past .

		The poor simple soul confesses unhesitatingly .

		She is delightful in her blunt honesty , which contrasts so glaringly with her husband 's high-flown hypocrisy .

		When reproached for not having confessed before their marriage , she asks , naively : '' But would you have married me all the same ?

		HJALMAK .

		How can you imagine such a thing ?

		CZINA .

		No ; but that was the reason I did not dare tell you anything then .

		For I got to love you very much , as you know .

		And I could not go and make myself completely un - happy . ''

		When asked if she has not suffered an anguish of remorse during all these years , she replies : '' Why , dear kdal , I 've had enough to do in attending to the house and the daily supervision of things . ''

		Such callousness , such degradation , makes Hjal - mar despair or , I should say , assume the mask of despair .

		He must -LRB- though it tires him a little -RRB- re - main upon the heights of sublimity to which he has mounted .

		He commands
Gina	PERSON	to - pack his trunk .

		He must separate from her .

		He can not continue to live a life of infamy , practically supported by a former rival for his wife 's favor ; for he learns that
Werle	PERSON	has constantly overpaid the elder Ekdal for his copying , and that it is this money which has enabled them to maintain their household in com - fort .

		But now all this must come to an end .

		With a grand gesture ,
Hjalmar	PERSON	tears to pieces a docu - ment in which the elder
Werle	ORGANIZATION	pledges himself to pay one hundred crowns per month to the elder Ekdal , and after the latter 's death to continue the payment of the same sum to
Hedwig	ORGANIZATION	.

		With fever - ish impatience he makes all the preparations for his departure from his desecrated home , and revels all the while in the admiration of his friend
Gre	ORGANIZATION	- gers .

		But when the moment comes for decisive action , he wavers .

		On one flimsy pretext after another , he postpones his journey .

		He thrusts Hedwig away from him , and cruelly wounds the feelings of the affectionate child .

		He fumes and
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 frets while considering the more sordid aspect of the situation which now presents itself to him .

		He concludes to do nothing rash ; but to remain at home until he can find new lodgings .

		With great care he collects the scattered bits of
Werle	ORGANIZATION	's prom - issory note and pastes them together , because he has no right , he avers , to renounce what is not his own .

		Gina brings him coffee and sandwiches , which he consumes with a lugubrious zest ; and though he is a little shamefaced when
Gregers	PERSON	surprises him in this prosaic occupation , he endeavors , though not quite successfully , to recover his heroic tone .

		He is really anxious to be persuaded to remain ; but feels in duty bound to yield only by degrees , and with the proper amount of high-flown declamation .

		He enjoys the interesting situation , and can not af - ford to dismiss it before having displayed his full arsenal of noble sentiments .

		The child , of course , which he has cherished like a snake in his bosom , offers unlimited opportuni - ties for fine rhetoric ; and
Hjalmar	PERSON	does not fail to improve them .

		Gregers , to whom
Hedwig	ORGANIZATION	has betrayed her grief , because her father will no longer believe that she loves him , has persuaded her to prove her love for him by the highest sacrifice in her power .

		And as the wild duck is the thing she is fondest of , while
Hjalmar	PERSON	has always pro- fessed to dislike it ,
Gregers	PERSON	advises her to kill it with her own hand .

		But so great is her misery , her feeling of superfluity and disgrace , that she turns the pistol against herself and sends the bullet into her own heart .

		Ibsen sums up the moral of his play in the words of Dr.
Relling	PERSON	-LRB- a cynical friend of the family -RRB- : '' Life might yet be quite tolerable , if we were only left in peace by these blessed duns who are continually knocking at the doors of us poor folk with their ' ideal demand . ' ''

		Rarely has a poet so ruthlessly satirized himself as
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	does in this remark .

		For it was this very ideal demand of which he had proclaimed himself the prophet .

		He is the most persistent of those duns who knock at the door of the average human soul , and disturb its sleepful contentment by their unwearied insistence upon full payment .

		But the bankrupt debtor is obliged to compromise at twenty , forty , or sixty per cent , or utterly repudiate the debt ; and the stern reminders of his dun can not make him pay more than he has .

		The mood in which Ibsen wrote '' The Wild Duck '' was one of deep dejection if not despair . ''

		You have got to take men as they are made , '' he seems to have said to himself , '' and no amount of preaching will make them any better than they are .

		I , with my ideal demand , may have been as great a mischief-maker as
Gregers Werle	PERSON	. ''

		And in order to emphasize this cynical lesson , he has in the relation of the elder
Werle	PERSON	to Mrs. SOrby fur - nished a counter foil to the Ekdal couple , who , after the revelation of the truth , settle down in a sort of hideous shivering nudity into a barren and joyless slough , stripped of all embellishing dra - pery .

		Werle senior is an utterly prosaic person , and frankly tells his fiancee of all his escapades ; whereupon she , encouraged by his freedom from prejudice , makes an equally compromising confes - sion .

		These two then form a marriage based upon the truth ; and we are left to form our own con - clusions as to the nature of their union .

		No , the truth is only for the strong ; and the strong are few .

		The ordinary man needs more or less harmless lies to bolster up his self-respect ; for without self-respect there can be no contentment .

		This is the doctrine very trenchantly preached by Dr.
Relling	PERSON	, who charitably devotes himself to in - venting the fitting lie which will minister to the happiness of each of his patients .

		It is he who in - stills into
Hjalmar	PERSON	's mind the idea that he is des - tined to make a great discovery , which will lift photography into the region of exact science ; and with the same ingenuity he saves the self-respect of his bibulous friend , the theologian Molvik , by per - suading him that his drunkenness is '' daemonic '' i. e. , the necessary and inevitable outbreak of some great undelivered force within him which has not found expression in its proper sphere .

		If instead of the ugly word '' lie '' we substitute its poetic synonym `` illusion , '' I fancy no one will seriously object to Dr. Rolling 's theory .

		For every one of us has his own illusion of life , himself in - cluded ; and his happiness depends upon the vivid - ness , the completeness , with which he is able to fit this illusion into actuality , or as much of it as ob - trudes itself upon his observation .

		I know I am a greater , a more admirable man in my own estimation than , most probably , I am in the estimation of the majority of my friends ; and if I did not have the private consolation of knowing that I am right and that they are wrong , I should not regard existence as much of a boon .

		My happiness nay , my very desire for self-preservation therefore depends upon my power of self-deception .

		If any Mephisto - phelian friend should ever succeed in convincing me of what infinitely small account I am in the world what a fortuitous agglomeration of atoms , hovering in the boundless space I fear I should be tempted to follow the example of poor
Hedwig	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can imagine no greater calamity that could befall a man than a sudden opening of his vision a sud - den dispelling of all illusion enabling him to real - ize with absolute correctness his relations to the uni - verse .

		In '' Brand '' Ibsen quotes with approval the scriptural passage , `` No man can see Jehovah and live . ''

		All truth that we see , in this life , is largely alloyed with falsehood ; it is relative , not absolute .

		As
Lessing	PERSON	says , '' If God held truth shut in His right hand , and in his left hand nothing but the ever restless striving for truth , though with the con - dition of forever erring , and should say to me , ' Choose , ' I would humbly bow to His left hand and say , ' Father , give me this ; pure truth is for Thee alone . ' ''

		What Lessing meant by truth , in this instance , was the great fundamental facts which underlie ex - 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, istence the eternal verities , physical and spiritual , which determine our relation to God and to our fel - low-men .

		But it might readily be extended to all human relations .

		The proposition would still hold good , that illusion is the prime requisite of happiness .

		COHMUNICA TIONS .

		A COLUMBIAN CELEBRATION A HUNDRED YEARS AGO .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A little book of 77 pages now in my possession fur - nishes evidence that the three hundredth anniversary of the discovery of
America	LOCATION	was not allowed to pass un - noticed , and affords also some interesting glimpses of our country and its affairs as they appeared a hundred years ago .

		Some account of the book and its author may therefore be acceptable at this time .

		The book is entitled '' An Oration on the Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, de - livered in
London	LOCATION	,
October 12th , 1792	DATE	. ''

		The orator was
Elhanan Winchester	PERSON	, a noted character in his day .

		According to the best information that I can get , he was born near
Boston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in
1751	DATE	.

		He began preach - ing in his eighteenth year , and , passing through several phases of religious belief , finally developed into a Univer - salist clergyman .

		During our Revolution he earnestly sympathized with the American cause , composing a num - ber of so-called '' political hymns , '' more remarkable for their piety and patriotism than for their poetry .

		After the war , in
1787	DATE	, he visited
England	LOCATION	, where he remained several years , preaching his doctrines of universal sal - vation and universal liberty .

		Returning to
America	LOCATION	in
1794	DATE	, he died at
Hartford	LOCATION	in
1797	DATE	.

		Passing over the historical portions of the work , which tell the familiar story of
Columbus	LOCATION	and his discovery very much as it is told to-day , and some speculations , more curious than valuable , as to the origin of the first inhab - itants of our continent , we come to the more interesting chapters giving the outlook on
America	LOCATION	in
1792	DATE	.

		The population of the entire continent -LRB- North , South , and
Central America	LOCATION	-RRB- is estimated at twenty millions .

		When as densely populated as
Holland	LOCATION	then was , the Amer - ican continent is capable of containing three thousand three hundred and four millions .

		The orator exclaims : '' Considered in this light , what an astonishing scene rises to our view !

		God , who formed the earth , created it not in vain ; he formed it to be inhabited ; and I have no doubt that before the conflagration takes place , the earth shall be inhab - ited and cultivated to the utmost possible extent ; this shall be in the glorious millenium , or the thousand years ' reign of Christ on earth ; which happy period is fast approaching and I trust is even at the door .

		Then , and not till then , shall the full importance of the discovery of
America	LOCATION	be known . ''

		Among the lessons already taught by the
United States	LOCATION	are enumerated the practicability of democracy , the wisdom of separating church and state , the justice of abolishing cruel and unnecessarily severe punishment for crime , and the strength of a mild and equable form of government as contrasted with the weakness of more arbitrary principalities .

		Notwithstanding the near approach of the millennium , which he has just predicted , the orator foretells the rapid development of his native land in the following prophecy , which has been so abundantly fulfilled : '' The century to come will improve
America	LOCATION	far more than the three centuries past .

		The prospect opens , it extends it - self upon us . '

		The wilderness and solitary place shall rejoice , and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose . '

		I look forward to that glorious day when that vast continent shall be populated with civilized and religious people , when heav - enly wisdom and virtue , and all that can civilize and bless the children of men , shall cover that part of the globe as the waters cover the seas . ''

		Transported at the thought , I am borne forward to days of distant renown .

		In my expanded view , the
United States	LOCATION	rise in all their ripened glory before me .

		I look through and beyond every yet peopled region of the New World , and be - hold period still brightening upon period .

		Where one con - tiguous depth of gloomy wilderness now shuts out even the beams of day , I see new states and empires , new seats of wis - dom and knowledge , new religious domes spreading around .

		In places now untrod by any but savage beasts , or men as savage as they , I hear the voice of happy labor , and see beau - tiful cities rising to view , behold the whole continent highly cultivated and fertilized , full of cities , towns , and villages , beautiful and lovely beyond expression .

		I hear the praises of my great Creator sung upon the banks of these rivers now unknown to song .

		Behold the delightful prospect !

		See the silver and gold of
America	LOCATION	employed in the service of the Lord of the whole earth !

		See slavery , with all its train of attendant evils , forever abolished !

		See a communication opened through the whole continent , from north to south and from east to west , through a most fruitful country .

		Behold the glory of God extending , and the Gospel spreading through the whole land ! ''

		An appendix to the published oration contains the pre - posterous '' political hymns '' already alluded to , a bio - graphical sketch of
George Washington	LOCATION	, and a plan and description of the new city to be called
Washington	LOCATION	, , `` at the junction of the rivers
Pawtomack	PERSON	and the
East	LOCATION	- ern branch . ''

		The valleys of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and the
Missouri	LOCATION	, the
Great Basin	LOCATION	of the West , and the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, constituted an unknown land .

		The western line of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	was the limit of civilization .

		The present national capital , with its throngs of people com - ing and going daily , is described as situated upon '' the great post road , equi-distant from the northern and southern extremities of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and nearly so from the
Atlantick	LOCATION	and
Pittsburg	LOCATION	. ''

		Added to this is the first census of the
United States	LOCATION	recently completed and certified to by ``
T. Jefferson	PERSON	, Secretary of State . ''

		The total population of the republic in
1792	DATE	footed up 3,925 , - 253 .

		The five largest states in point of population were
Virginia	LOCATION	, 747,610 ;
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, 434,373 ; North Car - olina , 393,751 ;
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, 378,587 ;
New York	LOCATION	, 340,120 .


Maine	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	were the only states not possessing slaves .

		In
Virginia	LOCATION	the slaves numbered 292,627 ; in
New York	LOCATION	, 21,324 .

		The towns in point of size ranked ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Balti	LOCATION	- more , and
Charleston	LOCATION	; in trade ,
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Charleston	LOCATION	, and
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		How far Mr.
Winchester	PERSON	succeeded in instilling Amer - ican principles into the minds of his hearers , it is im - possible to say .

		One can not fail to admire his courage , however , in stoutly proclaiming his convictions in the very centre of British conservatism , while resentment against the young republic was still bitter and the term '' Yankee '' was considered synonymous with rebel .

		Could he have realized how accurately his predictions would be fulfilled by the next Columbian centenary , it would have given peculiar emphasis to his closing paragraph : '' I die ; but God will surely visit
America	LOCATION	, and make it a vast , flourishing , and populous empire ; will take it under his protection , and bless it abundantly ; but the prospect is too glorious for my pen to describe .

		I add no more . ''

		THE DIAL 141 Ax OLI > HOPE ix A XEW TJIGHT .

		* The essay , considered strictly as a work of literary art , has had in our day no more strik - ing illustration than may be found in the vol - umes of Mr.
Frederic Myers	PERSON	.

		A pure and weighty style , producing , without any trick of rhythmical imitation , an effect akin to the po - etical , combined with a selection and arrange - ment of material resulting from a rare sense of relative values , gives to such essays as those upon
Virgil	PERSON	and
Mazzini	PERSON	a high place among the masterpieces of English prose .

		And we must ascribe to them not only such excellence of manner , but also a degree of scholarship that is not often allowed to appear within the limits of the essay .

		When we add that the subjects chosen by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	are mostly of such nature as to touch upon the highest con - cerns , that his essays have for no small part of their aim the transformation for modern uses , or the translation into modern terms , of the best wisdom of the past , the large discourse of poet and philosopher , we shall at least have indicated the nature of their claim upon the attention of thoughtful readers .

		We are all the more concerned to give to the work of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	this unstinted measure of praise , because the essays collectively enti - tled '' Science and a Future Life , '' which make up the author 's latest volume , can not be seri - ously reviewed without considerable dissent from their conclusions , or without one import - ant exception to their form .

		To take this ex - ception first , and to put the matter bluntly , the contents of this collection are so colored by the peculiar theories of the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, so characterized by special pleading in behalf of a series of propositions consid - ered by most serious thinkers not merely im - probable but absolutely untenable , that the es - says are wanting in the judicial quality of the best criticism , and are even , to a certain extent , misleading .

		Whether the subject be ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	and Agnosticism , '' u The Disenchant - ment of
France	LOCATION	, '' or '' Modern Poets and Cosmic Law , '' the discussion eventually shapes itself into an argument for telepathy , or ghosts , or the communion of the living with the dead .

		Mr.
Myers	PERSON	has to a certain extent met this ob - jection by a title which indicates the common tendency of the essays , and adverse criticism is * SCIENCE AND A FUTURE LIFE .

		With Other Essays .

		By
Frederic W. H. Myers	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		at least partly disarmed by the unusual candor of the writer , by his seBupiriorts care to give to the views of his opponents the full weight due them , and by the unquestionable honesty of his belief that the psychical researchers are really on the track of a new cosmic law of funda - mental significance .

		The attitude of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	toward modern science , with its destructive criticism of relig - ious beliefs , is very different from that of most defenders of the faith .

		He is sufficiently fa - miliar with scientific method to respect its re - sults , and never , even by suggestion , invokes the odium theologicum in aid of his contention .

		We doubt not , indeed , that he welcomes the work done by science in freeing religious thought from its accretions of theological rub - bish .

		But he holds firmly , even passionately -LRB- and passion rarely leaves the judgment un - warped -RRB- , to the belief in a conscious personal immortality , seeking to find new grounds for the belief , more substantial than those which , he admits , science has largely brought into dis - credit .

		`` The educated world , '' he sees , `` is waking up to find that no mere trifles or tra - ditions only , but the great hope which inspired their fathers aforetime , is insensibly vanishing away . ''

		And , claiming that '' a question so mo - mentous should not thus be suffered to go by default , '' he calls for a new '' stocktaking of evi - dence , '' an inquiry whether '' any evidence has been discovered bearing on a question which , after all , is to science a question of evidence alone . ''

		It is in the new field of experimental psy - chology that Mr.
Myers	PERSON	looks for the new evi - dence that is to rehabilitate an old and dying hope .

		He finds such evidence in the recent investigations of the abnormal consciousness , of the phenomena of hypnotism and multiple personality .

		He also finds it in the curious col - lections of the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great majority among men of science , of course , reject as totally inadequate the evidence for the phenomena of the latter class ; while for those of the former class , admitting many of them to have received proper evidential sub - stantiation , they find necessary no such inter - pretation as is given them by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	.

		What if there be a subliminal consciousness , they say ; what if the personality assume , in cer - tain cases , a dual aspect ; what if we have learned '' to conceive of our normal conscious - ness as representing only a fragment of the activity going on in our brains '' ?

		Mr.
Myers	PERSON	is himself candid enough to admit that '' these 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, expanding psychological prospects are still con - sistent with the view that all our mental activ - ities , however extensive and however subdivis - ible , may be dependent on cerebral changes , and may end with death . ''

		And having made this admission , there is little use in his adding , * The very magnitude of the change in our con - ception of personality might well make us pause before repeating the dogmas of negation which were framed with regard to far simpler and narrower facts . ''

		Why should the new con - ception of personality '' make us pause , '' if the old view of our mental activities is comprehen - sive enough to include , without readjustment , all the new facts ?

		To get any really logical sup - port for his view , Mr.
Myers	PERSON	is compelled to rely upon what are denied to be facts by nearly all serious psychologists , upon the alleged phe - nomena of thought-transference , of '' phantasms of the living '' and of hallucinatory images of the dying .

		It is surely a little premature to base a theory of personal immortality upon data which have not themselves gained the ac - ceptance of even a respectable minority among psychologists .

		It is a good rule to postpone the construction of your theory until you have established the facts upon which it must of ne - cessity rest ; enough of the facts , that is , to afford a working foundation .

		This was the rule that
Darwin	PERSON	to whom one of the author 's es - says pays generous tribute followed with such magnificent success .

		Mr.
Myers	PERSON	, in his opening essay , which bears the title given the entire volume , expressly ex - cludes from his discussion the '' moral and emotional arguments '' by which belief in a fu - ture life is usually supported .

		Yet he seems to us to stand upon firmer ground when he comes back to those arguments in a later chap - ter .

		The essay on ''
Tennyson	PERSON	as Prophet , '' and the other essay , largely devoted to the same theme , entitled '' Modern Poets and Cos - mic Law , '' offer a plea more convincing than any to be based upon the imperfectly appre - hended phases of the abnormal consciousness , or upon the ill-attested stories collected by the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		The argument from authority is always a dangerous argument to invoke , yet surely the authority of a man like
Tennyson	PERSON	is not lightly to be set aside .

		The loft - iest of the poets have always numbered among their functions that of prophecy ; their title to enduring fame has rested chiefly upon their character as seers , upon their insight , deeper than that of their fellow men , into the things of the spirit .

		Now
Tennyson	PERSON	, who knew and un - derstood as well as any man of his age the work of later nineteenth-century science , pre - served a faith , that grew stronger with his ad - vancing years , in the doctrine of conscious per - sonal immortality , a faith to which , in public and in private , he frequently gave impas - sioned and even vehement expression .

		This fact will not mean to most thinkers as much as it means to our essayist , who says : '' We have lost our head and our chief ; the one man , surely , in all the world to-day who , from a tow - ering eminence which none could question , af - firmed the realities which to us are all . ''

		But of it the most indifferent must take some ac - count ; the most unmoved by
Tennyson	PERSON	's spir - itual message must still be impressed by the cento of passages bearing upon the destinies of man , collected by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	from the writings of the poet .

		In this aspect of his thought , ''
Tennyson	PERSON	is the prophet simply of a Spir - itual Universe : the proclaimer of man 's spirit as part and parcel of that Universe , and in - destructible as the very root of things . ''

		We may , however , accept this latter prop - osition without putting upon it the narrow in - terpretation claimed for it by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	.

		He would be the last to deny that the philosoph - ical view of the universe broadens immensely and even transforms the popular notion of im - mortality .

		And he is not well advised to treat with covert contempt the Positivist form of that notion , comparing it with '' the grin with - out the cat of the popular fairy tale , '' and adding , with a touch of misplaced satire , that '' all in this sad world is well , since
Auguste Comte	ORGANIZATION	has demonstrated that the effect of our deeds lives after us , so that what we used to call eternal death the cessation , in point of fact , of our own existence may just as well be considered as eternal life of a very superior description . ''

		Most philosophic thinkers have found themselves forced to substitute for the narrow personal interpretation of the term im - mortality some such interpretation as is em - bodied in the Religion of Humanity , or is found in the universal soul of the pantheistic philos - ophies , or is logically implied in the idealism of
Berkeley	LOCATION	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		Indeed , many of the Tennysonian passages collected by the writer in support of the narrower view lend themselves with little difficulty to the wider , and thus illustrate afresh the fact that the really great poet builds better than he knows the structure of his song .

		One point more , and we have done .

		In read - ing a book like the one before us we can not re -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 frain from the question : This constant preoc - cupation with a life to come this insistent de - mand which will be satisfied with nothing less than the survival of memory after death , with the unbroken continuation of our present series of conscious states , is it helpful to the pursu - ance of the life that now is , with its manifold tasks and obligations ?

		Goethe thought not so ; nor
Emerson	LOCATION	; nor
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, whose splendid phrase , '' The free man thinks of nothing less than of death , '' gives , to those who have taken its meaning to heart , a heightened sense of the dignity of the life which is now unquestionably ours , if only for a time .

		And we can not ad - mit , what the author seems to take for granted , that the existence of a moral purpose in the universe is in any way indissolubly linked with the continuation of our individual series of states of consciousness .

		What need of invok - ing unknown forces and unseen powers to prove that the universe is moral ?

		Is not man a part of the universe , and is there not a moral pur - pose in human life ?

		In what sense , even , can we imagine a moral universe except as man makes it such ?

		To our mind , there is a more profound conception of the essential meaning of morality , a conception closer to the truth than that for which Mr.
Myers	PERSON	argues , in the view of the greatest of our poets now living , which the essayist formulates , only to reject as inadequate , in the following impressive terms : '' There is another phase of thought which also Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has presented with singular fire .

		That is the resolve that even if there be no moral purpose already in the world , man shall put it there ; that even if all evolution be necessarily truncated , yet moral evolution , so long as our race lasts , there shall be ; that even if man 's virtue be momentary , he shall act as though it were an eternal gain .

		THE VEHICLE OF HEREDITY .

		* While the majority of the biologists of the present day are engaged in the attempt to un - ravel the mysteries of cell life , including that most mysterious phase of cytic life , reproduc - tion , and are seeking as far as possible , with the aid of the microscope , to see all the most hidden circumstances of the act , there are also a great many other students who are seeking * THE GERM-PLASM : A Theory of Heredity .

		By
August Weismann	PERSON	.

		Translated by
W. Newton Parker	PERSON	, Ph.D. , and
Harriet Rb	PERSON	` nnfeldt , B.Sc .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		to add reasoning to the methods of the labora - tory and thereby to look behind the scenes and have a peep at nature 's inmost secrets .

		Of all the writers of this latter class , Professor
Weis	PERSON	- mann of
Freiburg	LOCATION	has probably attracted the greatest notice .

		He has during the past ten years been publishing articles of the utmost im - portance on the general subject of the physical structures and mechanisms of cell life and de - velopment , the central problem in his series of articles having been a mechanical statement of the facts of heredity .

		Noticing the patent fact that living creatures tend to produce their kind , he has sought to discover among the now im - mense mass of accumulated information bear - ing on the subject the clue to the cause of this so universal truth .

		A host of other writers have also approached the subject , and many of them have aided in the attempt at a solution of the mystery .

		But no one of them all has presented so completely elaborated and so plausible a theory of heredity as that of the author now engaging our attention .

		He has written many articles , and they have for the most part been translated into our tongue and found their way into the hands of a great many readers .

		His latest work constitutes the last number of the very valuable '' Contemporary Science '' series entitled '' The Germ-Plasm , A Theory of Heredity . ''

		The book is by no means easy reading ; in fact , it is the most ab - struse number of the series up to this date .

		There is not , however , any lack of clearness either on the part of the writer or the trans - lators , though it is inevitable that a work on so comparatively unusual a subject should not be as instantly intelligible as more usual topics are .

		The translators deserve great credit for the way in which they have performed their part in this most excellent production .

		The cell is no longer , as of yore , to be con - sidered the unit of biological structure , but is itself a structure or organism consisting of vi - tal units .

		The seat of the forces of the cell is the nucleus , and the controlling factors in cell-life are within the nucleus .

		Moreover , the substance of the nucleus is not uniform and ho - mogeneous , but is composed of various sorts of elements , their variety being greater in cells not yet mature than in those that have reached their final form and can be called fully devel - oped .

		From this it will be seen to follow that the egg cell is the most complex cell in the body of any animal ; and this we can be - lieve , as we reflect that the body is necessarily the result of the development or unfolding of 144 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept 16 , its contents .

		The nucleus has been proved to be the controlling factor in cell development by such observations as this one of
Boveri	LOCATION	, a very expert embryological observer , who took the nucleus out of a certain kind of sea ur - chin 's egg and then fertilized the egg with the sperm of another species , whereupon the egg - developed not into the species of the mother but into that of the spermatozoon .

		This proves that the male nucleus has hereditary power , and on other grounds it is shown that the fe - male nucleus also has the same power .

		The nucleus is thus shown to be the source of all the hereditary influences which actuate the egg , and it is likely that this is equally true of all cells at all stages of their life .

		The structure of the nucleus is then of the last importance for a theory of heredity .

		It has long been known that the nucleus is composed of two sorts of substance , one the idioplasm or , as it is often called , the chromatin and the other a watery non-staining material called the achro - matin .

		The chromatin or idioplasm exhibits great differences in different kinds of cells and eggs .

		It is , however , in general composed of rods , loops , or coils of deeply stainable material , the shapes and arrangement of which are very different for different kinds of cells and very fixed and constant for different cells of the same kind .

		It is the opinion of Professor
Weis	PERSON	- mann that these rods of idioplasm are made up of very definite elements of matter arranged in a very definite way , and that these elements are vital particles endowed with the properties of living things , including the powers of repro - duction and growth .

		He further thinks that they can give rise to cells , or groups of cells , by the mere unravelling , so to speak , of the parts they are composed of .

		The simplest of these compounds the author calls the '' bio - phore . ''

		This is the primary vital unit , whose structure can not be further simplified without destruction of its vitality .

		Biophores may con - ceivably differ as to their number of compon - ent molecules and as to the different kinds of molecules that enter into them .

		It is uncer - tain whether the biophores influence the cel - lular activities from within the nucleus , or mi - grate from the nucleus into the cell and thus work directly on the cell protoplasm .

		The bio - phore is further believed to be a definite en - tity and to have its own powers of life , growth , and reproduction , and to do its work through the aid of the cell body .

		The number of bio - phores in an animal body is further stated to be equal to that of the independently variable parts of that body , and not to the number of the cells of that body ; for in some cases many cells are so far alike that we can suppose them all derived from a single biophore .

		Thus all the red or white corpuscles of the human blood could be supposed to be derived from two bio - phores , while on the other hand we should need to assume a great number to produce all the different kinds of tissues of the nervous sys - tem .

		The biophore is thus regarded as a struc - tural unit of the lowest order , and its develop - ment is destined to produce all the cells of a given kind that enter into the composition of the body , and it can not by any possibility pro- duce any other kind of cells .

		The second stage in Mr.
Weismami	PERSON	's con - ception of the physical structure of the nuclear matter is the idea that the related biophores that is , those that are to form parts connected in any of many different ways are gathered together in the cell to form a larger unit than the biophore , for which the name '' determi - nant '' is employed .

		The determinant , with all its contained biophores , can divide and thus double the number of parts that can be de - rived from it .

		These determinants play a most conspicuous part in the author 's theory of he - redity .

		They are the agents called in to ac - count for the facts in many cases .

		They are not believed to be visible by any mode of mi - croscopical analysis now attainable , but are none the less of a certain definite size .

		The fact that the nucleus can contain them all is sought to be accounted for by the supposition that they are very minute .

		The determinants are further collected into related groups called `` ids , '' and these in their turn into '' idants . ''

		The ids are large enough to be seen in the nu - cleus , and are the deeply staining spots , '' mi - crosomata , '' that can be seen in the nuclear fil - aments , and these latter are called the '' idants . ''

		The egg cell is thus seen to be a microcosm in which all the parts subsequently to come forth from it are present in such wise that the ma - turation of each of these preexistent parts will produce the adult body down to every remotest kind of cell .

		It is a part of the conception that the biophores are so arranged that they will produce all the proper cells at the correct time , and that these will fall , by reason of their position in the idant , in exactly the proper place , and thus all confusion be avoided .

		Ac - cording to this notion , the egg cell is the most complex of all the cells .

		In its earlier divis - ions we should expect that the sorting out of materials to form principal portions of the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 body would occur , and that later the lesser parts would receive attention .

		And this is the case in many instances .

		In some eggs the earliest divisions of the egg separate one half from all the other half of the body ; in other eggs all the ectoderm is separated from all the endoderm in the earliest segmentation .

		The development of an animal or plant can be stated in the terms of this hypothesis as fol - lows : The nuclear matter of the egg will re - quire to be analyzed and its parts arranged for distribution to the cells to be formed out of it .

		For this the centrosome or nuclear spin - dle exists .

		This , as its appearance suggests , is a sphere of attraction whose forces analyze the idants and arrange them for transmission to the cells to be formed .

		At first the cell must contain a very large number of different bio - phores , and the task of sorting them must be a very delicate one ; but later the cells are not so filled with heterologous biophores .

		As the process continues , the cells will contain fewer biophores , and at last only one or a few , from which the final forms of cells will be derivable , and no others .

		If a cell could become arrested before it had parted with all its biophores , it could subsequently at any time under certain conditions produce all the sorts of cells that it would have produced if it had not been ar - rested .

		And to press this reasoning to its legitimate conclusion if the egg should , be - fore it had developed at all , set aside one half of its substance to go down into the body to be developed from the other half , and if the half thus set aside should later develop in the same way as the first half had done , then we should derive from the first body a descendant which would be just like it , for it would in reality be its twin .

		This is Professor
Weismann	PERSON	's conception , which he has called '' The Continuity of Germ - Plasm '' ; and it is the central idea of his theory of heredity .

		The conception is not so much a mere abstraction as it is the only notion of the physical constitution of the idioplasm which is possible in the light of our knowledge .

		The value of an hypothesis depends on its power to explain facts .

		In this regard this one is particu - larly valid .

		Some of the proofs of this must be given , even at the risk of encroachment on the limits of our space .

		For example , so general a fact of biology as the regeneration of lost parts is understood in the terms of germ-plasm to be due to the development of biophores that had remained latent .

		Their production is con - sidered to be a result of natural selection , as they more often occur in parts where they are useful .

		The common power of fission in the lower orders of animals is accounted for in some - what the same way by supposing a duplication of the biophores that produce not a part but the whole of the body .

		The effect of their gen - eral development would be to produce two bodies out of one .

		These two modes of de - velopment , then , result from the further matu - ration of already considerably developed bio - phores , one producing a part only and the other producing an entire body .

		One can be con - ceived of readily as the phylogenetic result of the other .

		Gemmation , on the other hand , an equally general biological phenomenon , can be regarded as the result of the development of idants that had been arrested early in their course , and reserved till a later date in the life-history at which to come to their maturity .

		And egg development is a mode of gemmation in which the cell is arrested at the very outset of its course ; but we must note that true egg development includes another event , the access of the spermatozoon .

		Gemmation and egg de - velopment are thus seen to be modes of repro - duction that may have resulted from that ac - tion of natural selection on the idioplasm .

		But the central fact of biological science is variety in the midst of unity , and the evolu - tion of animals and plants from the simple to the complex .

		How does this theory look in the light of the facts of evolution ?

		Mere mul - tiplication of living things can conceivably be brought about through fission and gemmation ; and , in fact , in plants and the lower animals these processes have a very great deal to do with the operations of replenishing the earth .

		Even egg development can be parthenoge - netic ; that is , the unfertilized egg can , as we should think it ought to be able to do on our theory , reproduce its descendant generation , and the male sex is unknown for many ani - mals .

		Vacancies in the ranks of the living , due to the sickle of the reaper death , could then theoretically be made full through the operation of the monogamic modes of reproduc - tion .

		Why , then , does sexual development have any existence ?

		The older schools of bio - logical thought taught that the sexes were un - like in regard to the part played by the egg and the sperm in the egg development .

		Many ideas on this point have prevailed ; thus , some thought that the egg was inert , and that the spermatozoon was needed to energize the other - wise dull egg .

		Others thought that the sperm o-ave to the egg certain elements that caused 146 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the variations from the racial type necessary for the evolution of species .

		Weismann differs from all other thinkers in holding that the egg and the sperm are composed of almost precisely identical idioplasm .

		I say '' almost , '' because he now is inclined to think that there are slight differences between the two , and that the mean - ing of the fertilization of the egg is not to fur - nish a stimulus to the egg but to unite the dif - ferent idioplasms of the two parents so as to bring about a slight variation in the idioplasm of the offspring .

		Professor
Weismann	PERSON	's theory accounts beautifully for the facts of heredity , but heretofore it has been defective on the other equally important side of variation .

		He has heretofore held that the germinal plasm is invariable ; now he modifies that view and states that they are not absolutely invariable , but that the sundry influences which play upcn the organism and affect the body at large play also to some extent on the germinal matter , and that these influences , while not sufficient to destroy the construction of the idioplasm , do impress slight differences on the idants strong enough to divert them slightly from the exact course of heredity .

		In the development of in - sects from unfertilized eggs there are slight de - viations from the maternal image ; if there were two variable hereditary elements there would be a chance for still greater divergences from the exact type of the parent .

		And he seeks to prove that the result of the fusion of sperm and egg-nucleus is a nucleus with the differences of both .

		The fertilization of the egg is thus re - garded as a device for the production of varia - tions , and it is considered to be an acquired character brought about in its great develop - ment among the higher beings through the operation of natural selection , by reason of the great advantage it conferred on its possessors .

		Considerable evidence is being collected to prove that this is the real meaning of this pro- cess , the data of which can not be cited here .

		It will be seen that this view of the meaning of sexual reproduction , or '' Amphimixis , '' leaves us in the same old difficulty .

		For it does not show us how the germ-plasm is caused to vary in the right direction and at the right time , so as to produce such variations as nat - ural selection can work on .

		The cases of Cope and the Neolamarckians are all regarded by
Weismann	PERSON	as being of the utmost interest , as showing us probable phyletic lines ; but they do not prove that use can affect the structure of the germinal matter so as to produce an off -
spring	DATE	on which the acquired character has been grafted .

		All the alleged cases of use-inherit - ance are dismissed as not proved , and many apparent cases are shown to be errors of con - clusion ; so that , both on theoretical grounds and on the results of experiment ,
Weismann	PERSON	concludes that somatic variations can not be transmitted .

		The variation of the idioplasm referred to as correlated with the somatic vari - ations is not in any sense understood by him as due to the results of those somatic varia - tions , but having occurred , they can be seized by natural selection .

		Such a view of the mat - ter leaves us where
Darwin	PERSON	left us in regard to this point .

		On the side of heredity the the - ory is a helpful working hypothesis , and is the closest approximation to a clear statement on the question that has as yet come to us ; on the side of variation and the origin of species , it leaves us very much in the dark .

		The author 's method in these essays has been progressive , and it is possible that he will later reach a clearer ground on the latter question , which is quite as important a biological truth as the fact of heredity .

		THE RECONCILIATION OF HISTORY AND KELIGION IN CRITICISM .

		THE DIAL 147 to the Buddhist missionaries ` who visited
Egypt	LOCATION	within two generations of the time of Alexander the Great ' '' -LRB- p. v. -RRB- .

		There is something very sur - prising in the attitude of the mind of the author toward evidence which this statement discloses .

		He unites a very light and slight estimate of the im - mense amount of knowledge and current convic - tions that has accumulated about the life of Christ with an extravagant and overweening sense of what can he done in a few pages to build up a new and erratic theory .

		Such a position promises nothing of any moment .

		Facts which need careful verifica - tion , wide comparison , and cautious interpretation , are hastily gotten together , as if they carried with them at once the author 's opinions .

		The most one will find in this work is , here and there , a useful sug - gestion . ''

		An Inquiry into the Truth of Dogmatic
Chris	PERSON	- tianity '' may be briefly characterized as an old - fashioned assault of unbelief on the defenses of or - thodoxy , defenses that rarely crumble in a degree proportioned to the cannonade they undergo .

		Time can alone deal adequately with them , softening them down and refashioning them to suit new services of light and life .

		The author has a clear , vigorous , unconcessive mind , and thinks himself candid , as doubtless in his inmost heart he intends to be .

		But his confidence in his complete victory in his trial of strength with the reverend archbishop of the most reverend church , and the still further confi - dence with which he throws down his gauntlet to all comers , show plainly that true diffidence and tearfulness in the higher realms of truth are far from him .

		His successes are those which usually attend on the well-directed blows of unbelief .

		A good deal sounds hollow under them ; some things give way ; but they leave in the end a barrier nearly as high and inaccessible as that which they first as - sailed .

		The author belongs to those who have a supreme confidence in the steady strokes of logic , thug following thug on the syllogistic anvil .

		This is seen by his definition of faith : '' Faith , I con - ceive to be a blind reliance on the views and asser - tions of others , and the utter suppression of rea - son '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- .

		Such men will see many things very distinctly , and many things not at all .

		When such a mind professes a desire to be convinced by an adversary , we seem to hear a rock exclaim : '' I would grow excellent corn if only some one , friend or foe , could be found to plant it plant it deep in my very bosom . '' ''

		The Newer Religious Thinking '' is a good an - tidote to the `` Inquiry . ''

		It is a fresh , popular , and enthusiastic presentation , in a series of sermons , of the vital , concessive forces of a living faith .

		Without directly touching the burden of the '' In - quiry , '' it would lift it from most minds by an in - sensible substitution of wider , more generous , and more just thoughts .

		There would thus insensibly take place that most needful transformation by which dogma a rock-like wall of ice dissolves away , becomes a running stream , and once more carries with it all the processes of life .

		This work brings courage and hope to the reader , and makes the world seem , what it truly is , an unfolding grace beyond grace , knowledge beyond knowledge of the divine mind .

		We escape the distress of finding things completely wrong now , and also the greater distress the absolute hopelessness of being able to make them right hereafter .

		It is wonder - ful that evolution should not seem to those who so readily entertain it a profound justification of the past as well as a limitless promise of the future . ''

		Christ and Criticism '' aims , as its primary pur - pose , to set forth '' how far the authority of Jesus Christ should properly be allowed to modify , or to regulate , the process of Biblical criticism '' -LRB- p. iv . -RRB-

		.

		The book is clear , candid , and concise .

		It considers somewhat at length the theory of Kuenen and others of the comparatively recent origin of the Jewish rit - ual , and is well fitted to make the mind more cau - tious in its critical essays .

		This , indeed , seems to be its chief value .

		There is a boldness , not to say rash - ness , about Biblical criticism that goes far to unhinge the mind , to destroy the criticism itself in common with all conclusions concerning the sacred record .

		More weight must be attached to existing conclu - sions , to historical testimony , to the slow determin - ation of opinions and events by the ages themselves in which they have been shaped , or there is no suf - ficient basis for criticism .

		Criticism that pulls to pieces with perfect freedom its subject-matter can only leave behind it disjecta membra .

		Its own pos - itive results will be far too weak to command respect in presence of the genei'al unbelief it has awakened .

		Weight is the universal condition of solid work .

		To show no reverence is to command no reverence .

		Criticism can create nothing , and it must therefore use sparingly and respectfully the material provided for it .

		The renewing of this impression seems to us the better purpose and result of the present work .

		To bring the testimony of Christ in a direct way to the support of any theory of interpretation is not so easy as the reverent mind regards it .

		The method implies a universality in the words of
Christ	LOCATION	, the full force of the thousand implications involved in his immediate purpose , that make of his teach - ings , not simply a seed-bed , but the entire harvest of later years .

		Thus , again and again , from the silence of Christ , or from an act , or from an asser - tion of his , having wholly other ends in view , there have been drawn conclusions wherewith to check the moral and spiritual growth of the world .

		We can not enuecleate our spiritual world in its entirety from the teachings of Christ .

		His words are of most value when they are allowed to flow most freely into our words ; when they are united most imme - diately and vitally with their own conditions .

		As a section of the river , a chapter in the book , they come forward to us in a far more effective way than when we undertake to regard them as a gen - eral synopsis of all truth . ''

		Verbum Dei '' expresses in its title the prevail - ing idea of the volume .

		The author , addressing 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, young men in preparation for the ministry , returns , under many forms of expression , to the supreme consideration that they must deliver a message which they have received from God .

		The author is plainly sincere and earnest in his exhortation , and will receive the hearty approval of the ordin - arily devout mind .

		An important truth lies back of the enforcement the need in one 's calling of a simple , devout , and devoted spirit ; but the exhor - tation , as the author puts it , seems to us tainted with presumption , mysticism , pietism .

		The aver - age young man , instead of finding in it a guide to sincere and wise effort , might readily fall , by means of it , into an unctuous and dogmatic temper entirely alien to the intention of the writer .

		He states as his theme : '' Every living preacher must receive his message in a communication direct from God , and the constant purpose of his life must be to re - ceive it uncorrupted , and to deliver it without addi - tion or subtraction '' -LRB- p. 17 -RRB- .

		Farther expressions of the same thought are : '' Language may be fei -- tilizing as well as charming if the tide of God is in it . '' ''

		Thus saith the Lord , tacitly introduces all that he teaches . '' ''

		An utterance from the deep cell of immediate revelation . '' ''

		Is the word of God in it authenticate and immediate and real ? '' ''

		He is to climb
Sinai	ORGANIZATION	with its ring-fence of death , and on the summit speak face to face with Him whom no one can see and yet live . ''

		These senti - ments , taken from the first lecture , are enforced in the lectures which follow , chiefly by a consid - eration of the character of the
Bible	LOCATION	and of the need of its study .

		One lecture is entitled , `` The Word of God Outside the Bible . ''

		In this there is a passing mention of science , but no mention of those large and urgent questions which touch the relations of men to each other .

		Is there not here a profound mistake on the part of the lecturer , in spite of his earnest and liberal temper ?

		Has any young man any right to put his opinions , whatever they may be , first upon God and then upon his fel - low-men , as ultimate truths ?

		Does not this idea rest with its entire weight on the dogmatism of the past ?

		Is a young man likely to find a simple and modest message and a true work in this way ?

		How shall he attain the earnest , consecrated , and also wise temper , which the times and all times demand , otherwise than by a daily inquiry into that very theme , overlooked by the lecturer , Sociology the coming of the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, here and now , among men ?

		It seems to us a great wrong to the
Bible	LOCATION	to magnify it in this way , and at the same time to separate it from its most immediate work , the redemption of society .

		What young men su - premely need is an earnest spirit in working with men for men , in all lower and higher ways ; and this spirit must ever arise in immediate view of the wants of men .

		We have no patience with a super - naturalism that blinds a man to the spiritual world he lives in .

		`` The Gospel and its Earliest Interpretations '' is a work well and clearly conceived , and executed with fulness and care .

		Only a rigid notion of inspira - tion can hide from us the diversity of outlook in different portions of the New Testament ; and the artificial harmony we secure by our narrow render - ings is attended by grave losses .

		Our fellowship with each writer will be stimulating in the degree in which it is free .

		The foreground is assigned in this book to the words of Christ ; these are followed by the view of his life given by his more immediate Jewish disciples ; then come what the author terms the
Pauline	PERSON	transformation and the secondary kin - dred transformation , of which the Epistle to the Hebrews offers the most marked example .

		These are followed by the Johannine , the anti-gnostic , and the Apocalyptic interpretations .

		That there is ground for distinguishing all these phases of thought many would readily admit ; and also that , in tracing these distinctions , we come to a much better and broader understanding of the very wide-reaching problem of the formation of Christian faith .

		We think , how - ever , that the process of discrimination , once en - tered on , readily suffers exaggeration .

		The truth is that diverse things and contradictory things can be said and done by the same person , and still carry with them very little real division of thought .

		The religious world has suffered immensely , both in ac - tion and in interpretation , by magnifying wholly secondary distinctions .

		In discussions of this chai 1 - acter , questions of authenticity and of interpreta - tion are allowed to flow into each other too readily .

		The first set of inquiries are far less facile than the second .

		We can interpret safely only when the shore-marks of the text are well defined for us , and we are not allowed to determine its authenticity by the exigencies of our theory in rendering its words .

		If it is true , however , that the critic is especially tempted to magnify differences , it is still more true that the general reader of the New Testament greatly obscures them .

		A very important service is rendered by a work like the present in restoring local color to the various writings of the New Tes - tament .

		The last volume on our list is `` Theosophy , or Psychological Religion . ''

		No English author has done more than its author ,
Max Mliller	PERSON	, to identify the necessary steps of development in religious truth with the historical growth of religions .

		The two are essentially one .

		Whatever religion may owe to the superior insight of gifted minds , to a revelation of which they are made the prophets and apostles -LRB- and it owes very much to these personal points of light -RRB- , none the less , the real test of religious truth .

		that by which it has been for the time being saved , and later passed on as a permanent term in the development of the race , has been its hold , as an actual faith , on the minds of men .

		In discuss - ing , therefore , the fundamental conceptions of the various religions of the world , and the manner in which they prepare the way for , support , and sup - plement each other , we come , as we can not other - wise come , both at the order of religious develop - ment and at the tremendous weight of proof which
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 attaches to the truths reached along this line of race-unfolding .

		Skepticism is impossible if we truly see and feel that these primary spiritual principles are really the product of all the reason of the world , acting both instinctively and rationally , individu - ally and in all men collectively .

		The present vol - ume is another most significant contribution in this same direction . ''

		These lectures contain the key to the whole series , and they formed from the very beginning my final aim .

		They are meant as the coping-stone of the arch that rests on the two pil - lars of Physical and Anthropological Religion , and unites the two into the true gate of the temple of the religion of the future .

		They are to show that from a purely historical point of view Christianity is not a mere continuation or even reform of
Juda	PERSON	- ism , but that , particularly in its theology or theos - ophy , it represents a synthesis of Semitic and Aryan thought which forms its real strength and its power of satisfying not only the requirements of the heart , but likewise the postulates of reason . ''

		-LRB- Preface , viii . -RRB-

		.

		These lectures , with much incidental dis - cussion , cover a wide field in oriental and Grecian eschatology and theosophy , and gather their con - clusions together in connection with the church at
Alexandria	LOCATION	and with the mysticism of Mediaeval Christianity .

		A careful perusal of a book of this order becomes an immediate requisite of every stu - dent who is striving , at least in his own thought , to unite history and religion in one universal develop - ment ; to make criticism subserve its real purpose of uniting and consolidating all truth .

		Hunting on the Western plains and mountains .

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	's '' The Wil - derness Hunter '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a rather sumptuous volume , profusely illus - trated , is largely a narrative of the author 's hunt - ing experiences on and about his ranch on the
Little Missouri	LOCATION	, and in the outlying mountainous region of western
Montana	LOCATION	and northwestern
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		The business of '' ranching '' has , for some occult reason , a special charm for the gilded youth of the Eastern States ; and Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	seems to have followed it , in a gentleman-amateurish sort of way , for some years before his fancy led him into the more precarious paths of politics .

		During these years , he tells us , he '' hunted much , among the mountains and on the plains , both as a pastime and to procure hides , meat , and robes for use on the ranch ; and it was my good luck to kill all the va - rious kinds of large game that can properly be con - sidered to belong to , temperate
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		No one , after reading Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's books , will question his claim to having wrought a great deal of havoc in the animal world .

		Bison , moose , elk , deer , caribou , etc. , have fallen in great numbers before his conquering rifle .

		It is fair to say , too , that he has carried on his warfare against the '' native burghers '' of forest and plain , with some shadow of justifiable end , and with a nice regard to the dictates of the sportsman 's code .

		No single elk , deer , bison , or other victim on Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's list , has had reason , so far as we can discern , to com - plain that it was killed in other than a thoroughly sportsmanlike way a fact equally soothing , doubt - less , to both parties to the transaction .

		But it is not our purpose to chop morals with our author on the point indicated .

		The book is thoroughly read - able , and it contains , aside from matter of mere en - tertainment , much that should prove of practical value to the sportsman and of interest to the na - turalist .

		The author describes every de - tail of the famous caravels , and shows that they were stanch ships , properly fitted up ; but when he says they were '' greatly superior to those dragons in which the Normans -LSB- Norsemen -RSB- made wonder - ful voyages through frozen and ice-packed seas , dis - covering and colonizing
Iceland	LOCATION	,
Greenland	LOCATION	, and the northern part of
America	LOCATION	, 500 years before the suc - cessful enterprise of
Columbus	LOCATION	, '' we must refer him to the Viking ship which has lately sailed across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and is now on exhibition at the
Co	ORGANIZATION	- lumbian Exposition .

		The grotesque caravels are mere tubs as compared with the picturesque Viking ship , and can in no wise be compared with the lat - ter in seagoing qualities .

		In the art of shipbuild - ing the Norsemen were farther advanced in the tenth century than the navigators of
Spain	LOCATION	or Por - tugal in the fifteenth .

		This criticism does not , of course , impugn the general accuracy of Mr.
Ponce de Leon	PERSON	's work , which is in the main to be heartily commended .

		In a little book on '' The Secret of The Secret of Character Building '' -LRB-
Griggs	PERSON	-RRB- , by '' '
John DeMotte	PERSON	, we have the attempt of a religious nature to provide a scientific explana - tion and authorization for a theory of morals and religion .

		.

		That what , is called the spiritual life has its basis in sensation and nerve-structure is a fact that religious people are too apt to overlook , and one which our author does well to emphasize .

		The tedious process of eradicating bad habits -LRB- or nerve - tracks leading upon stimulation to vicious action -RRB- , and of establishing good ones , is necessary before 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the higher life can be considered a stable possession .

		In the words -LRB- and capitals -RRB- of the book : `` The Physical Basis of a virtuous life is a network of
Trunk Lines	ORGANIZATION	, where the incoming waves of stimu - lation , on reaching the cerebral hemispheres of the brain , find there well-worn tracks , with switches already set , leading to the God-given higher posses - sions of the Soul holy memories , pure imagina - tions , consecrated ambitions , righteous judgments , and a Will whose nerve connection with these higher faculties is so perfect that at once , unless the line of duty presents complications requiring consideration , the commands for right conduct are flashed out through the outgoing nerve tracks , and instantly obeyed . ''

		Despite a slight confusion in the author 's thought and metaphor , and a little more parade of science than was necessary for the enforcement of his thesis , he rightly concludes that a sudden conversion , to secure a man from falling , must be reinforced by patient continuance in well - doing , that young converts need much more helpful care and attention than they receive , and that it is much better and easier to learn right habits at the outset than to sow wild oats now and rely upon making all right by '' getting religion '' later on .

		It is possible to cease from vicious action , but the traces of it and the tendency to it always remain a part of the physical basis of character .

		One can pull out the nail ; one can not pull out the nail - hole .

		`` This book is the expressed conviction of the writer that we shall never build the highest types of Christian character until society feels a deeper concern for the establishment in youth of none but sound nerve-tracks in moral areas . ''

		We welcome
Ernest Redwood	PERSON	's A French protest .

		i , , / T-II \ I against Material - translation of '' Youth -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , by nce -
Charles Wagner	PERSON	, as an evidence that Americans are beginning to realize that not all Frenchmen are flippant and licentious , and are be - ginning to take an interest in the serious thought of
France	LOCATION	.

		The original book has aroused wide atten - tion as one sign of a healthy reaction in
France	LOCATION	against the prevalent materialism , utilitarianism , realism , naturalism .

		Wagner points out the dan - gers of exclusive devotion to positive science belit - tling man in his own eyes , to the neglect of charac - ter , culture , and training , and the dangers of that ex - treme centralization which has given us our mon - ster cities with pauperism on the one hand and lux - ury on the other .

		All that is evil in these things is opposed to the modern spirit , which he defines as the '' sum total of the best which man has derived from all the mighty labors and sufferings of the past . ''

		It is fairmindedness and breadth of view , or the true scientific spirit ; it is kindness and jus - tice , or the true humanitarian spirit ; it is solidar - ity and altruism , or the true socialistic spirit .

		Man 's success , during the past century , in construct - ing the machinery of a vast material civilization has been splendid , but man himself is a failure .

		He is overdriven and crushed by the Juggernaut he A - typical J & n - giish School Years Ago .

		has made .

		It is useless , or worse than useless , to master the material forces of the universe if we can - not master ourselves .

		Man is the basis of all civ - ilization , and it is because man is weak that our civilization threatens to crumble and fall about our heads .

		To regain strength , our youth must return to normal thinking and normal living , to rever - ence , to belief in something , to a feeling of responsi - bility , to work , to chastity , to simplicity , to joy - ousness , and where possible to country life , to communion with nature .

		Such are some of the points eloquently set forth in this very readable book .

		In his '' The Ancient Ways : Win - .

		* chester Fifty Years Ago '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- jv ^ th -LRB- j ^ w Tuckwel -RCB- ?

		an old Winchester boy , gives a lively picture of his life as a pupil at that venerable foundation .

		In reading this account of Winchester school one scarcely knows which to wonder at most the barbarity of the boys , the indifference to it of the masters , the prac - tical futility of the curriculum , or the affectionate way in which the Rev. Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	seems to look back upon it all .

		The abominable custom of '' fag - ging '' which makes the smaller boy the lawful drudge and victim of the larger flourished in es - pecial vigor at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author himself suffered grievously therefrom in mind and in body , if not in estate ; and he feelingly heads a chapter on the subject with the familiar third line of the Second Book of the ^ neid .

		As to the school-work , he says , '' We were ' suckled on Latin and weaned on Greek ' ; little else was cared for . ''

		Fifteen hours a week were given to Latin composition not to translating into Latin , but to `` original '' composi - tion on a given theme .

		An incredible amount of Latin was learned by heart , and once a year the boys were publicly tested as to their proficiency in this useful accomplishment .

		On these occasions '' the lines were said in eight lessons '' ; and once , as the author records , a pupil `` took up 2,000 lines a les - son , 16,000 lines in all '' a parrot-like feat which seems to have afforded the examiners much satis - faction .

		A mild feint was made at French and German , mathematics did not even count in the school marks , and the fact that '' very rarely in - deed a theme was given for English writing '' is not altogether unattested in Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	's own style .

		In short , any branch remotely savoring of utility was severely frowned down at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	, and the pupil of the period left school , we opine , with the mental equipment of a mediaeval monk , and about as fit as
Caspar Hauser	PERSON	for the real activities of life .

		It is high commendation to say that An appreciative _ / and judicial Mr.
O Connor Morris	PERSON	, in adding an - life of
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Qther
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	rf
Napoleon	PERSON	to the multi - tude -LRB- `` Heroes of the Nations '' series , Putnam -RRB- , has not been carrying coals to
Newcastle	LOCATION	.

		He has made a valuable book , in which the ever-fascinating narrative of that wonderful life is told again with appreciation yet with calm judgment .

		The fact
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 that
Napoleon	PERSON	, like other men , grew under the in - fluences of his circumstances is '' too little recog - nized , although such recognition is necessary to any sane estimate of the man .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	here em - phasizes it .

		The genius of the soldier and general is conceded by all , but we are here led to behold also the consummate ability of the administrator .

		This latest biographer , however , has to confess that
Napoleon	PERSON	was not a great statesman , that while his domestic policy bore many rich and beneficent fruits , it was the policy of a beneficent despot , and that his imperial plans were the outcome of an in - ability to account for nationality and of an ambi - tion which was seldom in touch with the practical .

		It must be conceded , however , by the careful stu - dent of history , that much in the career of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon was the result of forces he did not control .

		When he came to the front , already had the wars of the Revolution period engendered a universal European distrust of French ambition , and already were the hostile forces of a world gathered around his camps .

		He could not go backward , and every step forward led but to a final
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		No bet - ter summing up of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's policy and charac - ter , and of his contribution to history , has ever been written than the last chapter of this book , which we commend to all students of the career of the man of destiny .

		ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FAJLL , BOOKS .

		In presenting our annual list of books that are an - nounced for the coining Fall and
Winter	DATE	by American publishers , those principles of classification and arrange - ment have been followed that have in the past been found most convenient and helpful to our readers .

		The division into departments of literature , obviously of much practical advantage , has been attended with no little difficulty , owing to the meagre information some - times furnished us ; and if an occasional book is wrongly classified , the error is due to this cause alone .

		We be - lieve , however , that few such errors have occurred , and that the list as a whole will prove as trustworthy as it is instructive .

		Some suggestive comments upon it will be found in the leading editorial article in this number of THE DIAL .

		LITERARY XOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		The Independent Theatre of
London	LOCATION	has issued its programme for the coming season .

		It includes
Herr Strindberg	PERSON	's `` The Father , '' Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's `` The Wild Duck , '' and a comedy by
M. Zola	PERSON	. ''

		The
Sewanee Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has recently com - pleted its first year , will hereafter be conducted by Pro- fessor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, author of the life of
Simms	PERSON	in the '' American Men of Letters '' series .

		The
New York Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	has begun to re - print in its '' Bankside '' edition the archaic texts of the seventeen plays first printed in the Heminges and Con - dell Folio of
1623	DATE	.

		The first of these plays , '' The Tem - pest , '' will leave the press in a few days .

		Of these new volumes but 500 copies are printed .


Germany	LOCATION	has been having a
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, the place of meeting being at
Munich	LOCATION	.

		The principal ques - tion discussed was the reform of the law of literary property , with especial reference to the copyright treaty between
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, which is re - garded as very unfavorable to the former .

		A committee was appointed to prepare a memorial on this subject , to be submitted to the
Imperial Government	ORGANIZATION	and to be laid 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, before the
Reichstag	LOCATION	.

		The Convention adjourned to meet next year in
Hamburg	LOCATION	.

		An English publisher writes to '' The Author '' to put on record a novel experience . ''

		This morning 's post , '' he says , `` brings an unasked-for and most acceptable cheque towards recouping publishers ' losses from one whose book a really good book that was much praised failed to ' catch on . '

		I want to place on record that this is onr first and only experience of the kind . ''

		An extraordinary decision is reported from the French courts .

		The newsdealing firm of Messrs.
Brentano	PERSON	's in
Paris	LOCATION	was sued for having placed on sale a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper wherein was contained a libellous article upon a former minister of
France	LOCATION	to
Hayti	LOCATION	.

		The court decided that the offending firm should pay both costs and heavy damages , as well as the expense of inserting the judgment in a number of journals .

		Such a decision as this must place the English booksellers of
Paris	LOCATION	in a very peculiar predicament .

		If they are to be held responsible for the contents of all the newspapers they offer for sale , they may as well retire from business .

		On
November 8	DATE	, Dr.
Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	will cele - brate his fifty years ' '' Doktorjubilaum '' A great num - ber of the friends and admirers of the eminent scholar are of opinion that the day should be marked by some substantial acknowledgement of his epoch-making work .

		They have resolved to collect a sum of money , and pre - sent it to the historian on the day of his jubilee as doc - tor , in order that he may found a '' Stiftung '' for the promotion of scientific studies in his own branch of la - bor , the arrangement of the character and statutes of this '' Mommsen-fund '' being left to his discretion .

		Foreign scholars and friends who wish to subscribe may remit to
Ludwig Delbriick	PERSON	, 61 ,
Mauerstrasse	ORGANIZATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		ENGLISH VIEWS OF THE AUTHORS ' CONGRESS .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' of recent date contained an extended article on the Authors '
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	, written by Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, who , as is well known , was an active and influential member .

		He found the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' a truly representative meeting , '' and '' the papers produced were written by those whose experi - ence in the subjects treated and whose position in the world of letters entitled them at least to a respectful hearing . ''

		The most quotable portions of the article are those addressed particularly to certain comments on the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by that somewhat witty caviller Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and that somewhat wearisome caviller Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	.

		Referring to the former gen - tleman , Mr.
Besant	PERSON	pointedly says : '' What is the good of holding such a Conference ?

		A certain English man of letters has asked this ques - tion , adding , as his answer , that an author has nothing to do but to sell his wares and have done with it .

		But suppose he will not sell his wares and so have done with it .

		Suppose he understands what many men of let - ters seem totally unable to understand that his wares may represent a considerable , even a great property , which is going to yield a steady return for many years ; that he ought no more to sell this property ' and have done with it ' than he would sell a rich mine , or a mill , or a row of houses , and have done with it , unless for a consideration based on business principles .

		To such as understand this axiom t. e. , to all who are concerned in the material interests of literature such a Confer - ence may prove of the greatest possible use . ''

		For instance , among the questions to be considered were , -LRB- 1 -RRB- all those relating to copyright , international and domestic ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- all those which relate to the admin - istration of literary property ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- all those which are concerned with literature itself its past , its present , its tendency .

		... It is manifest that the first two branches may be most important to those concerned with literary property too often anyone but the pro- ducer and creator of it .

		There is , however , another point .

		It is greatly to be desired that those who be - long to the literary profession should from time to time gather together and recognise the fact that they do be - long to a common calling .

		Hitherto the author , though he calls himself a man of letters , has been too apt to refuse the recognition of a profession or calling of let - ters .

		He has sat apart alone ; nay , in many cases his only recognition of his brethren has been a cheap sneer or a savage gibe .

		To this day there remain a few of those of whom Churchill wrote , who can never speak of their brethren but with bitterness or derision .

		Such a man at such a Conference is out of place ; much more important , his very existence comes to be recognised as an anachronism : he will no longer be tolerated . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's rather captious question , '' How can a hundred Congresses at
Chicago	LOCATION	secure the conditions '' of independence for the author , is thus answered in an - other place : '' The author 's independence will be secured for him from the moment that his pay the commercial side of his work is put , once for all , on such a footing of re - cognized terms and proportions as will make him abso - lutely independent of the publisher and dependent solely on the public , as a physician , or a barrister , or an archi - tect , or a solicitor , is independent .

		This can be done , and will be done , by the arrival at an understanding be - tween honorable publishers and leading writers .

		What - ever understanding this may be , it must rest upon the basis of the demand for a book by the public .

		Our ef - forts have been all along directed to showing the liter - ary profession the meaning of their property so that they may see the necessity of coming to such an under - standing . ''

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	expresses the hope that when next an Author 's
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or Conference , is held , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	will be there to see .

		Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	, however , who '' does his little best to darken counsel by prating foolishness about Literature and Lucre , '' Mr.
Besant	PERSON	hopes and trusts '' will not be present . ''

		The '' literature and lu - cre '' argument is thus treated : '' Another kind of literary man is he who is continu - ally inveighing against the baseness of connecting liter - ature with lucre .

		He appears in this country , on an average , once a year , with his stale and conventional rubbish .

		Where this kind of talk is sincere , if ever it is sincere mostly it comes from those who have failed to connect literature with lucre it rests upon a con - fusion of ideas .

		That is to say , it confuses the intellec - tual , artistic , literary worth of a book with its com - mercial value .

		But the former is one thing , the latter is another .

		They are not commensurable .

		The former has no value which can be expressed in guineas any more than the beauty of a sunset or the colours of a rainbow .

		The latter may be taken as a measure of the popular taste , which should , but does not always , de - mand the best books .

		No one , therefore , must con - sider that a book necessarily fails because the demand for it is small ; nor , on the other hand , is it always just or useful to deride the author of a successful book be - cause it is successful .

		In the latter case the author has perhaps done his best ; it is the popular judgment that
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL should be reproved and the popular taste which should be led into a truer way . ''

		A book , rightly or wrongly , then , may be a thing worth money a property , an estate .

		It is the author 's property unless he signs it away ; and since any book , in the uncertainty of the popular judgment , may be - come a valuable property , it is the author 's part to safe - guard his property , and not to part with it without due consideration and consultation with those who have con - sidered the problem .

		And it is the special function of such a Conference to lay down the data of the problem , and so to help in producing , if possible , a solution .

		But as for the question is it sordid , is it base , for an au - thor a genius to look after money ?

		Well , a pop - ular author is not always a genius .

		But even those who are admitted to have some claim to the possession of genius have generally been very careful indeed with re - gard to the money produced by their writings .

		Scott ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, Trol - lope ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	, almost every man or woman of real distinction in letters - , can be shown to have been most careful about the money side of his books .

		It is left for the unsuccessful , for the shallow pretenders , or for some shady publisher 's hack , to cry out upon the degradation of letters when an author is advised to look after his property .

		Let us simply reply that what has not degraded the illustrious men who have gone before will not degrade those smaller men , their successors . ''

		Elsewhere in this interesting article , Mr.
Besant	PERSON	in - dulges in some optimistic observations on what he terms the `` new Literature of the West '' : `` The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Literature was held at
Chicago	LOCATION	at a fitting moment .

		It may be taken as the inauguration of a new Literature which has just begun to spring up in the
West	LOCATION	; a Literature of which I for one was pro- foundly ignorant until I learned about it on the spot .

		At present it exists chiefly in promise ; but if it is a bantling , it is a vigorous bantling .

		In what direction this new Literature of the West will develop it would be quite impossible , even for one who knows the condi - tions of Western life , to predict .

		Enough to place on record for the moment , the fact that there has sprung into existence during the last year or two a company of new writers wholly belonging to the
West	LOCATION	.

		All over the broad valley of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and on the
Western	LOCATION	prairies there are farmers in vast numbers living for the most part in solitary homesteads ; their chief re - creation is reading ; there are also small towns and vil - lages by the thousand ; places whose population is be - tween one and two thousand , in every one of which will be found a ladies ' literary society and a library .

		The former holds meetings , receives papers , and is , gener - ally , a centre of a certain intellectual activity ; for the latter , the ladies who manage it endeavor to procure as many new books as possible . ''

		OLD STANZAS WORTH REPRINTING .

		Thousands of visitors to
Chicago	LOCATION	this
summer	DATE	, and other thousands of our citizens , have noticed , in passing and repassing by railroad between the city and the Fair grounds , the fine group of bronze statuary standing near the lake front at Eighteenth street , on the line of the
Illinois Central Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		This group , the work of Mr.
Carl Rohl-Smith	PERSON	, a Danish sculptor who won dis - tinction by his statue of Franklin that adorns the en - trance to the Electricity Building at the Fair , was erected through the generosity of Mr.
George M. Pullman	PERSON	, as a memorial to mark the spot of the Indian massacre at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1812	DATE	, when the garrison of Fort Dear - born , having evacuated the fort and started to march to
Detroit	LOCATION	, was attacked after marching a few miles and nearty exterminated .

		The dedication of the mon - ument was naturally the occasion of a considerable out - pouring of commemorative verse , some of the best of which is given a place in
Major Kirkland	LOCATION	's very read - able history of the massacre , lately published by
Messrs. Dibble & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		To our mind , however , by far the best verses on this theme are those written twenty years ago by that brilliant Western poet ,
Benjamin F. Taylor	PERSON	, and first published in '' The Lakeside Monthly '' for Octo - ber ,
1873	DATE	.

		We subjoin the stanzas referred to : '' Born of the prairie and the wave , the blue sea and the green , A city of the Occident ,
Chicago	LOCATION	lay between ; Dim trails upon the meadow , faint wakes upon the main , On either sea a schooner and a canvas-covered wain . ''

		I saw a dot upon the map , and a house-fly 's filmy wing They said ' t was
Dearborn	LOCATION	's picket-flag when Wilderness was king ; I heard the reed-bird 's morning song the Indian 's awkward flail The rice tattoo in his rude canoe like a dash of
April	DATE	hail , The beaded grasses ' rustling bend the swash of the lazy tide , Where ships shake out their salted sails and navies grandly ride ! ''

		I heard the Block-house gates unbar , the column 's solemn tread , I saw the Tree of a single leaf its splendid foilage shed To wave awhile that
August	DATE	morn above the column 's head ; I heard the moan of muffled drum , the woman 's wail of fife , The Dead March played for
Dearborn	LOCATION	's men just marching out of life , The swooping of the savage cloud that burst upon the rank And struck it with its thunderbolt in forehead and in flank , The spatter of the musket-shot , the rifles ' whistling rain , The sand-hills drift round hope forlorn that never marched again !

		199 THE LITERARY WEST .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's famous essay '' On a Certain Condescension in Foreigners '' is in need of a supplement .

		`` A Certain Condescension in Easterners '' is a theme that calls for treatment in similar vein ; but the pen rusts that alone could have dealt with it adequately , that alone could have bestowed upon it the measure and quality of genial satire that it deserves .

		For many years past the attitude of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	writers towards literary activity in the West has been similar to that once assumed by
Boston	LOCATION	towards
New York	LOCATION	, and by
England	LOCATION	towards the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It has been an attitude of condescen - sion , of patronizing counsel , of mild surprise that a region so far removed from the centre of the intellectual system should venture to have such things as literary aspirations . ''

		But you are so very far away , '' was the naive remark recently made to a gathering of American scholars by a foreign guest who was trying to be complimentary , but who could not refrain from coupling surprise with admira - tion .

		Most Eastern explorers who brave the passes of the
Alleghany Mountains	ORGANIZATION	, and find their way to the intellectual frontier settle - ments of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, return to their homes with a tale from which the element of wonder is rarely missing .

		Every now and then some weekly paper or monthly magazine of the
Atlantic Coast	LOCATION	devotes an article to Western literature , and , whatever the aspect it selects for treatment or the writers it singles out for fame , the accent of encouragement is always marked .

		This display of provincialism is amusing enough to all but the few who live in the in - tellectual corners whence it originates ; but it has one feature which has not been given the prominence that it deserves .

		As far as con - descension goes , with its patronizing implica - tions , the classical essay already mentioned may possibly be thought to cover the ground , for , mutatis mutandis , its criticism is applicable to
New England	LOCATION	narrowness as well as to Old England insularity .

		But the phase of the mat - ter which seems to call for particular com - ment , and upon which
Lowell	PERSON	hardly touched , is that illustrated by the kind of literary pro- duction which , in both cases , attracts the atten - 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, tion of the elder community to the work of the younger .

		Americans are not a little diverted when they notice the sort of thing upon which European critics of our literature are wont to seize as typical of our intellectual activity .

		`` Your countrymen , '' says
Richard Grant White	PERSON	, in the character of
Mansfield Humphreys	PERSON	, speak - ing to his English fellow-traveller , '' even the intelligent and kindly-intentioned , are so stung with a craze after something peculiarly Amer - ican from
America	LOCATION	that they refuse to accept anything as American that is not extravagant and grotesque .

		Even in literature they accept as American only that which is as strange and really as foreign to the tastes and habits of the most thoroughbred Americans as it is to them . ''

		To this propensity of the European we must in large measure attribute the astonishing trans - atlantic vogue of Poe and Whitman and Mr.
Harte	PERSON	.

		Excellent writers all three , and cer - tainly among the foremost that this country has produced ; yet it is to their accidental char - acteristics , rather than to their display of the qualities common to all good literature , that they in great part owe their reputation abroad .

		To quote once more from the writer above mentioned , the foreign critic is constantly put - ting to our literature such a question as this : '' Where is that effluence of the new-born in - dividual soul that should emanate from a fresh and independent democracy , the possessors of a continent , with a
Niagara	ORGANIZATION	and a
Mississippi	LOCATION	between two vast oceans ? ''

		And the foreign critic , finding this '' effluence of the new-born individual soul '' to emanate very perceptibly from such a writer as
Whitman	LOCATION	, seizes upon him as a typically American product .

		To the sane student , of course , these characteristics of Whitman that so impress the foreigner are the husks of his genius ; they are in themselves intolerable , but we put up with them because of the fitful flashes of imaginative style that find their way through these uncouth wrap - pings .

		But the foreigner takes the envelope for the substance ; while for the American lit - erature that is merely good , according to the accepted and immutable standards of literary workmanship , he has but scant recognition .

		This peculiar attitude of the foreign critic towards American writers is closely paralleled by the attitude of the
East	LOCATION	towards the
West	LOCATION	; and this brings us to the special subject of our remarks .

		When an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	writer undertakes to discuss the literary activity of the W r est , he almost invariably falls into the error of the foreign critic , and singles out as noteworthy and typical the writers whose work evinces some sort of eccentricity .

		It may be badly written , it may be grotesque , it may be vulgar it fre - quently has all three of these characteristics , but it is original , it is piquant , it satisfies the unholy yearning for the new thing .

		Some com - poser of dialect doggerel , cheaply pathetic or sentimental , gains the ear of the public ; his work has nothing more than novelty to rec - ommend it , but the advent of a new poet is her - alded , and we are told by
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	critics that the literary West has at last found a voice .

		Some strong-lunged but untrained product of the prairies recounts the monotonous routine of life on the farm or in the country town , and is straightway hailed as the apostle of the new - est and consequently the best realism .

		Some professional buffoon strikes a new note of bad taste in the columns of the local newspaper , and the admiring East holds him up as the exem - plar of the coming humor .

		Some public lec - turer , sure of the adulation of his little coterie of followers , estimates or interprets the litera - ture of the world in accordance with whatever vagaries occupy his unregulated fancy , and the surprising announcement is made that a great creative critic has arisen in our midst .

		Skilled in the arts of self-advertisement , these men are quick to enlarge the foothold thus gained ; their reputations grow like snowballs ; they come to take themselves as seriously as they are taken by others ; and the people of real culture and refinement , whose numbers are so rapidly in - creasing in the West , have to endure the hu - miliation of being represented , in the minds of a large proportion of their fellow-countrymen , by men who are neither cultured nor refined .

		In the meanwhile , hundreds of men and women throughout the West are engaged in producing literary work too excellent to be obtrusive , work that conforms to the recognized standards of all serious writing , work that scorns to be effective at the cost of style and moderation and good taste .

		But if the average
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	reader be asked who , in his mind , are the represent - ative writers of the West , he will name persons indignantly repudiated , for the most part , by Western readers of intelligence and discrim - ination .

		The selection will doubtless be made in good faith , and the fault will not be his ; it will be the fault of the newspapers that have supplied him with the information , of the care - less critics who make it a matter of faith that whatever is Western must needs be wild .

		A heavy responsibility rest with these critics both for the part they play in giving notoriety to

		THE DIAL 175 scribblers who offend against art , and for their persistent failure to recognize the really praise - worthy work done by Western writers .

		We do not claim that this work is as yet very great in amount , or that much of it de - serves very high praise ; but we do claim that it is respectable both in quality and quantity , and that both of these facts are to a consider - able extent ignored by
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	writers .

		We expect that the West will make a large con - tribution to American literature during the coming ten or twenty years ; and , if ever sane criticism is needed , it is at such a time .

		But the criticism we get tends to discourage honest workmanship and to encourage what is extrav - agant and meretricious .

		Above all , it is time to have done with the notion , forced upon us with wearisome iteration by certain writers , both
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western , that the West is now developing , or ever will develope , a distinct - ive literature of its own .

		The West and the
East	LOCATION	are peopled by the same sort of men and women , and their work , when it deserves the name of literature at all , has , and will have , the characteristics common to all good writing in the English language .

		The distinction between East and West will never be other than an ar - tificial one ; even now , many of the best writ - ers of either section came to it from the other .

		If the national centre of literary activity fol - lows the Westward path of the centre of pop - ulation , as seems probable , it will carry with it the accepted literary tradition , before which all crude local growths of tradition will be forced to give way .

		The coming literature of the West may be largely Western in its themes , but it will never be Western in its manner , as certain blatant rhetoricians would persuade us .

		Except in their relation to choice of subject - matter , the terms
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western , North - ern and Southern , have absolutely no literary meaning in a country all of whose parts have a common speech .

		The same standards apply to all the literature written in the English lan - guage , whether produced in
England	LOCATION	or
Austra	LOCATION	- lia , in
Canada	LOCATION	or the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Still more closely do they apply to the literature produced in different sections of our country , and it is an unfortunate application of local patriotism , whether Eastern or Western , that seeks to cre - ate a distinction where none should exist , or that , in its endeavor to create such a distinc - tion , ignores the necessary unity of a national literature , and attaches undue weight to the ac - cidental qualities of its particular manifesta - tions .

		ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL STUDIES AT
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		The passing year has been for
Chicago	LOCATION	one of ex - tremes .

		Never before has there been in the hands of her bankers so much money , and never before has there been so much of suffering among her thousands of unemployed .

		Never have her mate - rial resources been so exploited in the eyes of the world , and never has her intellectual and moral life been so stirred and stimulated , as in the past few months .

		For nearly half a year she has been play - ing the host to a series of Congresses devoted to wellnigh every field of thought which contributes its ideals to the culture of the race ; and she has found leisure at the same time to entertain a vast array of conventions , conferences , and annual meet - ings of literary , scientific , and industrial associa - tions .

		During a large part of
September	DATE	the atten - tion of the public was rightly concentered on the sessions of the
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps the most remarkable gatherings of the whole series .

		But while the local press gave its pages copiously to the chronicle of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, it almost ignored the presence , at the same time , of two bodies whose sessions in
Chicago	LOCATION	mark an important stage in our intellectual growth .

		The
International Statistical Association	ORGANIZATION	held dur - ing the
second week of September	DATE	its fifth biennial session , in the halls of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Amer -
ican Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The session of the for - mer was fraught with the greatest interest , many very notable papers being read .

		The proceedings of the
Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	were concentrated into one rich day , when papers were read by Gen. Fran - cis
A. Walker	PERSON	, and Professors
Hadley	PERSON	,
Patten	PERSON	,
Clark	PERSON	, and
Taussig	PERSON	.

		The speakers were all mas - ters in their fields , and the small audiences were composed of experts and workers .

		With no par - ticular notice from the outside world , these meet - ings were conducted with an earnestness of purpose and of attention which made their sessions a valua - ble contribution to the advancement of social science , stimulating and invigorating that kind of research which is conducted quietly in a corner , and which is known generally in its results rather than in its agents , to whom the obtainment of truth is a suffi - cient quid pro quo .

		The combined meetings brought
Chicago	LOCATION	a spe - cial double honor for the first time .

		During the seven years of its existence , the
Economic Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion has seemed to find in the western boundary of the thirteen original States a Rubicon beyond whose charmed frontier it could not pass .

		At last the As - sociation has gone forth to possess the continent ; and
Chicago	LOCATION	is seized as the key to the situation .

		The
International Association	ORGANIZATION	takes its first flight over sea , and is introduced to
America	LOCATION	by
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Both departures are significant .

		At the banquet which
the International Association	ORGANIZATION	enjoyed at the 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, hands of its entertainers the Statistical and Econ - omic Associations of
America	LOCATION	among the honored guests at the head of the table sat
Chicago	LOCATION	's three college presidents , educators , all of them , by a life-work of training , and all of them recognized as investigators and original scholars .

		In their affilia - tion with the leading economists of
America	LOCATION	and the most prominent statisticians of many lands was made manifest
Chicago	LOCATION	's place in the forefront of the newer education , where scientific research and liberal training go hand in hand .

		By its visit to
America	LOCATION	, the
International Association	ORGANIZATION	recog - nizes the statistical work of a land where Col. Car - roll
D. Wright	PERSON	stands the acknowledged peer of any statistician living , and where a school of younger statisticians is growing up around governmental and collegiate centres as brilliant as it is exact .

		By its visit to
Chicago	LOCATION	, the
Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	focuses its attention on the home of the youngest of our economic publications '' The Journal of Political Economy , '' which at a single stride has taken a place beside the Harvard '' Quarterly Journal of Economics '' and '' The Economic Journal '' of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nowhere on this continent can economic problems be studied to better advantage than in the city which probably already ranks first in population , and where varied nationality as well as numbers present some of the most perplexing aspects of social turmoil .

		Nowhere better can the statistical expert find the raw material of his com - binations than in this largest centre of the food sup - plies of the world .

		In every variety of produc - tion , in every phase of distribution , in every agency of exchange , this city is a huge laboratory of econ - omic phenomena , furnishing experiments ready made to the hand of the observer .

		Here , whence twenty - five lines of railway radiate , and where two hun - dred and fifty miles of street tramways intermesh , the railroad problem is best surveyed .

		No other city furnishes larger scope for the student of muni - cipal economics .

		Nowhere is the evil that a Toyn - bee Hall or a
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	seeks to face more ap - parent .

		The World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, un - doubtedly , brought us the
Statistical and Economic Associations	ORGANIZATION	in its train ; but the Exposition has helped to reveal to a large portion of humanity what the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' called a greater exhibit than the
White City	LOCATION	''
Chicago	LOCATION	itself .

		And this thronging of the millions at our doors has put them in the way to see that not only has
Chicago	LOCATION	the stu - pendous material resources which have made the Exposition an educational success , but that she is also awakening to a higher life , of which her uni - versities , her libraries , her Art Institute , her learned societies , are but the earnest .

		It has forced them to recognize the magnitude of our industrial life , and it will undoubtedly lead the thinkers and workers among them to turn their gaze more frequently upon our great laboratory of social science , where not a few of the leading investigators of the coun - try are already at work .

		LITERARY TRIBUTES TO WORLD 'S FAIR .

		THE No person of prominence in the literary world has , we believe , been rash enough to attempt a de - scription of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		The special correspondents have , of course , portrayed it in a variety of aspects and in gorgeous newspaper style ; and occasionally a venturesome poet has taken a shy at it in a sonnet or a quatrain .

		But to de - scribe it as a whole , to realize the full vision of the
White City	LOCATION	in words and fix them in literature , is a task too formidable for any near beholder , whose brain is overwhelmed and bewildered by its own impressions .

		As Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, aptly expresses it : `` I could no more describe the impression made upon me by the Exposition than I could pick up one of the buildings and carry it off on my shoulders .

		It was simply a journey into
Fairyland	LOCATION	; and I know of no one that ever lived who made a trip of that kind and brought back any adequate account of what he had seen with the exception of Shakespeare . ''

		Yet there is always a special value in the word of an eye-witness , and first impressions are significant , however imperfect their expression .

		THE DIAL has lately interested itself in collecting from a number of the prominent literary people who have visited the Fair some brief comments on or characterizations of it , such as might serve to show , in some measure , the impres - sion which the Fair as a spectacle makes on the lit - erary mind .

		In these fragmentary but often felic - itous expressions , which are given below , there will be found much that is of interest .

		The reserve shown by these practised writers befits the vastness of the theme ; they prudently refrain from attempt - ing to exhaust either the subject or themselves .

		Possibly some less experienced and more enthus - iastic writers may find a hint here worth the noting .

		The best writers do not '' gush , '' or depend over - much on adjectives , even when writing of a
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition .

		MARY
HARTWELL CATHERWOOD	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's contribution so admirably re - flects what is doubtless the dominant impression made by the Exposition upon imaginative minds the impression of magical and bewildering beauty , tinged with sadness at its transitoriness that we gladly place it at the head of the collection . ''

		The more I see of the Fair the more I want to see of it .

		I long to wake up there and get its aspects in the early morning ; and to haunt it when the lights are turned off after
midnight	TIME	.

		It is not like any other country I have ever seen .

		As soon as you become a day-inhabitant of the White World , you are emancipated from the troubles of earth .

		It has a strange effect .

		I am all the time conscious of deep pity for any human being who loses the sight of it .

		One of its strangest influences is stripping you of the sense of locality .

		I can find my way anywhere on the crust of the globe ; but in the Fair I give it up .

		Geography may go by the board .

		I take with thankfulness the place which comes nearest to me , and my head whirls , and the
Plaisance	PERSON	moves

		THE DIAL 177 from side to side in its usual game of hide and seek . ''

		So fascinating is the environment there that I never expect to learn anything from the exhibits : there is no time .

		Some day I shall mourn lost opportunities .

		But mortals can not do everything .

		And one can expand his knowledge and take a world-bath in
Jackson Park	LOCATION	now by merely sitting still and watching the nations pass by .

		`` One question I dare not face : What shall we do when this
Wonderland	LOCATION	is closed ?

		when it disappears - when the enchantment comes to an end . ''

		CHARLES
DUDLEY WARNER	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's word is for use rather than beauty rather , perhaps , for the usefulness of beauty . ''

		I think that those who were most familiar with the finest architectural effects abroad were most astonished at the aesthetic side of our World 's Fair .

		It was wholly unexpected .

		But the impression upon the great public of the
United States	LOCATION	of this incomparable vision of beauty is more important .

		The sight of it has changed the world , has changed the aspect and the estimate of life , for tens of thousands of home-keeping people .

		It has introduced into practical lives the element of beauty , and opened a new world of enjoyment .

		The extent of this transformation grows upon me , since I visited the Fair , in conversation with others , and in letters I have seen from all parts of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, which speak of what the spectacle at
Jackson Park	LOCATION	has done for the writers .

		I do not mean in regard to the competing exhibits those have their separate educating influence , but to the quickening of the imagination , and the enlargement of the appreciation of beauty .

		It is no criticism upon the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, absorbed in material development , to say that they needed just such an up - lift .

		If it can not be called a spiritual influence , it is an aesthetic impulse that leads away from materialism . ''

		GEORGE W. CABLE .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	, too , finds in the Fair a great and per - manent educating influence , well worth its cost . ''

		I consider that notwithstanding any supposable money loss to those who have invested their funds in the Fair , it is nevertheless one of the best investments the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	has ever made .

		It has lifted her status in the national estimation and declared her the first of American cities .

		The higher values of the Exposition it would be pleasant to predict , but they must be left for time to prove .

		I believe time will show them to be vast .

		The educative and stimulative effect to hun - dreds and thousands of the people of our nation will be incalculable .

		As a single instance , I think we may look with confidence for a great salutary effect upon the pub - lic architecture of our country . ''


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's thought is also of the great good the Fair will do
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''


Chicago	LOCATION	, having been in the world for some fifty or sixty years , is now finally of it .

		Instead of merely be - ing connected by rail , water , and wire with the various great centres of the world , it is on the point of becom - ing a great centre itself not merely commercial , but financial , social , political , artistic , educational .

		The West is leaving the provincial standpoint which , not long ago , was that taken by the country generally : the idea that we are big enough and strong enough and suc - cessful enough to live our own detached life according to our own isolated standard .

		Some few remnants of this narrow notion still linger : the bumptious Western objection to making over our ministers at foreign courts into ambassadors , and the monstrous far-western belief that we may maintain a monetary standard of our own that contravenes the general understanding of Christen - dom .

		The Fair , in fine , has brought the world to us , and sent us out into the world , and given us a chance to '' heft '' it , and to find our place in it , and to estab - lish intelligent and intelligible relations with it .

		The 30th of
October , 1893	DATE	, will be
Chicago	LOCATION	's graduation day .

		And the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	will be found to be no mere ' business college , ' qualifying us narrowly for a narrow life and its narrow purposes , but a real and broad university one to advance us in the arts , the sciences , the amenities , the humanities . ''


HJALMAR H. BOYESEN	PERSON	.

		Prof.
Boyesen	PERSON	sees in the external features of the Fair the realization of some glorious dream . ''

		The Fair is the completest and most magnificent resume of the world 's work and thought that ever has been gathered in one place .

		In its external aspect it is a vision of delight unrivalled on this side of
Fairyland	LOCATION	.

		To describe the beauty of the electric illumination at night is beyond the capacity of any language .

		It is as if some bold spirit had dreamed a glorious dream which by enchantment had petrified into reality . ''


HARRIET MONROE	PERSON	.

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	, whose '' Columbian Ode '' was the literary feature of the opening of the Exposition , has given a later impression , happily condensed into a sonnet . ''

		I saw a water-lily rise one morn ,
White	ORGANIZATION	, wondrous , and above the level blue Unveil her virgin petals to the dew And fill her heart with sunlight .

		She was born Of royal race , to reign and to adorn .

		O'er the wide world the joyous tidings flew , And all the nations came with treasures new To praise her loveliness , and weep forlorn .

		For from the host went forth a mighty sigh That ere the falling of a
summer	DATE	sun The dream must pass , the splendor fade away .

		Yet knew I well her beauty could not die .

		When she hath gone her power is but begun : Death sends the soul to God 's eternal day . ''

		WILLIAM P. TRENT .

		Another felicitous sonnet comes from Prof.
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, of
Sewanee College	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It was written , '' says the author , '' one sleepless night at my hotel in
Chicago	LOCATION	, after a day at the Exposition .

		It is at least an unfeigned and spontaneous tribute to what I believe to be the most beautiful thing in all the world a thing that we call ' The
White City	LOCATION	, ' but for which no name is fitting or sufficient . '' ''

		Where once the red deer , chased by wily foes , Sought the broad bosom of the peaceful lake , Behold a noble city bloom and break Into a flower of beauty !

		It arose As though from some enchanter 's wand , and glows With supernatural splendor .

		Angels take Shy glimpses from the sunset clouds that make The only rivals that it fears or knows .

		O fair dream-city of the fruitful West Fair as the splendid visions that appeared To Prospero 's companions , and conf est To be as frail , thou yet shalt live ensphered In every grateful memory that hath blest The minds that planned thee and the hands that reared . ''

Oct. 1	DATE	,
PAUL BOURGET	PERSON	.

		M.
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, the French novelist , gives a few unstudied observations . ''

		The Fair is like
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		... I have only the general first conception of a vast wilderness of beauty .

		Vast , big more than any description could carry .

		It is wholly unlike the
Paris	LOCATION	Exposition .

		The two could hardly be compared .

		There are no common points of similarity ; they are not of the same kind .

		This is the more wonderful by far greater in expectation and re - alization , but American , typically so .

		That such a great city of white beauty should have been reared from level areas of wooded waste is a miracle ... The effect of the water the artificial waterways , I mean is sur - passingly beautiful .

		But I am attempting to speak of what has struck me dumb with wonderment . ''

		WALTER
BESANT	PERSON	.

		From Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's '' First Impressions of the Fair , '' as printed in '' The Cosmopolitan '' maga - zine , we make the following characteristic extracts : '' When the visitor happens to be a literary man , one who is in the habit of writing and speaking of things offered to the public , he wanders about the courts and galleries of the Exposition oppressed , far more than the inarticulate person , by the vastness of the subject .

		To such a man the great truth that he can not say anything adequate and that he need not try , falls upon his spirit , when it is once grasped , like a cool shower on a hot af - ternoon .

		It lends a new and quite peculiar charm to the show ... '' The bigness of the World 's Fair first strikes and bewilders one tries in vain to understand it and then it saddens .

		I observe that most people , like Xerxes , set down their tears to the evanescent nature of the show ... Then again , the Poetry of the thing !

		Did the conception
spring	DATE	from one brain , like the Iliad ?

		Were these buildings every one , to the unprofessional eye , a miracle of beauty , thus arranged so as to pro- duce this marvellous effect of beauty by one master brain , or by many ?

		For never before , in any age , in any country , has there been so wonderful an arrange - ment of lovely buildings as at
Chicago	LOCATION	in the present year of grace ... Those English travellers who have written of
Chicago	LOCATION	dwell upon its vast wealth , its cease - less activity , its enormous blocks of houses and offices , upon everything that is in
Chicago	LOCATION	except that side of it which is revealed in the World 's Fair .

		Yes , it is a very busy place ; its wealth is boundless ; but it has been able to conceive somehow , and has carried into execu - tion somehow , the greatest and most poetical dream that we have ever seen .

		Call it no more the
White City	LOCATION	on the
Lake	LOCATION	; it is
Dreamland	LOCATION	.

		Apollo and the Muses , with the tinkling of their lyres , drown the bells of the train and the trolley ; the people dream epics ; Art and Music and Poetry belong to
Chicago	LOCATION	; the hub of the universe is transferred from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	; this place must surely become , in the immediate future , the centre of a nobler world the world of Art and Letters . ''

		RICHARD
WATSON GILDER	PERSON	.

		To the foregoing brief but expressive tributes we are very glad to add Mr.
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	's beautiful poem written for the
October	DATE	'' Century '' and printed here from an advance copy kindly furnished by him .

		It is an eloquent expression of the feelings awakened in contemplation of the early disappearance of the Exposition , and - is called `` The Vanishing City . ''

		`` Enraptured memory , and all ye powers of being , To new life waken !

		Stamp the vision clear On the soul 's inmost substance .

		let seeing Be more than seeing ; let the entranced ear Take deep these surging sounds , inweaved with light Of unimagined radiance ; let the intense Illumined loveliness that thrills the night Strike in the human heart some deeper sense !

		So shall these domes that meet heaven 's curved blue , And yon long , white imperial colonnade , And many-columned peristyle endue The mind with beauty that shall never fade : Though all too soon to dark oblivion wending , Reared in one happy hour to know as swift an ending . ''

		Thou si i alt of all the cities of the world Famed for their grandeur , ever more endure Imperishably and all alone impearled In the world 's living thought , the one most sure Of love undying and of endless praise For beauty only , chief of all thy kind ; Immortal , even because of thy brief days ; Thou cloud-built , fairy city of the mind !

		Here man doth pluck from the full tree of life The latest , lordliest flower of earthly art ; This doth he breathe , while resting from his strife , This presses he against his weary heart , Then , wakening from his dream within a dream , He flings the faded flower on
Time	ORGANIZATION	's down-rushing stream . ''

		never as here in the eternal years Hath burst to bloom man 's free and soaring spirit , Joyous , untrammelled , all untouched by tears And the dark weight of woe it doth inherit .

		Never so swift the mind 's imaginings Caught sculptured form , and color .

		Never before Save where the soul beats unembodied wings ` Gainst viewless skies was such enchanted shore Jewelled with ivory palaces like these : By day a miracle , a dream by night ; Yet real as beauty is , and as the seas Whose waves glance back keen lines of glittering light When million lamps , and coronets of fire , And fountains as of flame to the bright stars aspire . ''

		Glide , magic boat , from out the green lagoon , ` Neath the dark bridge , into this smiting glow And unthought glory .

		Even the glistening moon Hangs in the nearer splendor .

		Let not go The scene , my soul , till ever ' t is thine own !

		This is Art 's citadel and crown .

		How still The innumerous multitudes from every zone , That watch and listen ; while each eye doth fill With joyous tears unwept .

		Now solemn strains Of brazen music give the waiting soul
Voice	ORGANIZATION	and a sigh , it other speech disdains , Here where the visual sense faints to its goal !

		Ah , silent multitudes , ye are a part Of the wise architect 's supreme and glorious art ! ''

		joy almost too high for saddened mortal !

		ecstasy envisioned !

		Thou shouldst be Lasting as thou art , lovely ; as immortal As through all time the matchless thought of thee !

		Yet would we miss then the sweet piercing pain Of thy inconstancy !

		Could we but banish This haunting pang , ah , then thou wouldst not reign One with the golden sunset that doth vanish Through myriad lingering tints down melting skies ; Nor the pale mystery of the new-world flower That blooms once only , then forever dies Pouring a century 's wealth on one dear hour .

		Then vanish ,
City of Dream	ORGANIZATION	, and be no more ; Soon shall this fair
Earth	LOCATION	's self be lost on the unknown shore .

		THE DIAL 179 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		BAILF PAPERS AND THEIR READERS : A SUGGESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wish to express my great appreciation and earnest approval of the noble and notable editorials on journal - ism that have lately appeared in THE DIAL .

		The un - satisfactory character of the average metropolitan news - paper -LRB- there are exceptions that deserve praise and up - ward tendencies in certain quarters that merit commend - ation -RRB- I think is more widely felt and more keenly re - gretted than is often supposed .

		It has become very largely a mere mechanical contrivance for the gather - ing of comparatively unimportant items , which are de - scribed with tiresome verbosity : trivial personalities spun into sensational columns , the barbarities of crim - inals magnified and thrown upon a canvas which would do for the records of the day of judgment , numberless incidents of the sporting world made into a vast pile of news out of all proportion to their general interest or real importance , the idle gossip and inane doings of brainless men and heartless women forced daily upon our attention as a part of the world 's history worthy our remembrance .

		Skip what is trivial , morbid , and unwholesome , and how little is left ; look for an ade - quate report of the heroism and progress of mankind , and how seldom it is found .

		The '' blanket sheet '' is often called the mirror of the world ; but how false the statement !

		Trivial things are there made to look like affairs of immense magnitude , while what is there re - flected very largely belongs to the seamy and unseemly side of human life that may well be kept in silence and darkness .

		What I wish , however , is not so much to bring an accusation as to bear my testimony and make a sugges - tion .

		I do not believe that even business considerations warrant the policy which so largely controls the man - agement of the press in this respect .

		The people want the news and all the news , we are told .

		And this fact is used to justify the filling of column after column with the longest possible accounts of the worst and least important happenings of the day .

		Probably this policy pleases some , and increases sales to a certain ex - tent .

		But I believe that a large majority of people want a different and a better paper a paper that would crowd these matters into small space or drop them alto - gether and give more news of a wholesome and instruct - ive character .

		I believe that this class , at present silent in dissent and protest , is larger than the business manager calculates , and that to conduct a newspaper with more consideration of its wishes would be a sound financial policy .

		But what shall we do about it ?

		Have an endowed press that shall be a philanthropic enterprise , maintain - ing a high ` standard in spite of the business tide against it ?

		Perhaps ; but I dislike to see such a confession of the weakness of righteousness .

		Besides , I do not think this the permanent or the necessary solution of the problem .

		Public sentiment is powerful , and newspa - pers are run to make money .

		Remembering these two facts , those of us who want a nobler journalism must try in every way to make our demands felt and obeyed .

		If the people at present dissatisfied with the press as it is -LRB- they are a great multitude -RRB- will but make their wants clearly understood and forcibly felt , the press will re - spond .

		Let every man who desires something better put the pressure of his opinion upon editor and mana - ger , and improvement will begin at once .

		The people can usually have what they want if they ask for it .

		It will not do to disapprove but keep silent , and by buy - ing the paper make the management think that we are satisfied .

		Let every man who reads these words sit down and write out his protest and send it into the edi - torial room .

		Let him get ten neighbors to do the same , each under promise that he will secure ten others who will roll on the multiple of ten .

		Before many days , editor and manager would be putting their heads to - gether in grave consultation , and soon reporters would be sent out to hunt for news in new and higher realms .

		It would be seen that business policy demands a more wholesome journalism .

		We can have something better , but we must make the demand felt in order to get it .

		I am confident of two things : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A vast number of people want a different and a nobler newspaper .

		They now buy in silence what they do not like , while they run their eyes with disgust over pages which they would , be glad not to see .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- If these people will make their demand in a systematic and forcible manner , it will make an impression and work a revolution .

		This will put the force of gravity on our side , and business en - terprise will find its way very quickly in our direction .

		There is nothing like divine discontent : a gruff voice , but of powerful eloquence !

		If need be , we must or - ganize and agitate in order to make business managers of the press feel that there is profit in paying attention to the wishes of those who demand a clean , instructive , and wholesome newspaper , in which the quality and proportion of news shall bear some relation to the needs and decencies of human life .

		`` NONE BUT THEY , '' ETC. .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		I reply to Mr.
R. O. Williams	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
August 1	DATE	: Landor , in The Last Fruit Off an Old Tree , '' dog - matizes as follows : '' ' Antique ' is the worst portion of Gray 's heritage ... Iir honest truth , we neither have , nor had then , a better and -LSB- read or -RSB- purer writer than he r -LSB- read him -RSB- , although he lived in the time of the purest and best ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	, Field - ing , and Inchbald . ''

		With reference to this , I venture in my '' Modern English '' to query : '' But is Gray 's English , from the ordinary point of view , altogether faultless ? ''

		And then I specify words and phrases from Gray , among which are '' none but they '' and '' nobody but I. '' These expressions , in the opinion of Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, are '' very good English , as good English as there is . ''

		Compendiously , old authors may , I know , be quoted , without number , for `` none but they '' and the like ; and , in recent times , these archaisms have been indulged in by poets , as a license of their craft , or else for the sake of quaintness , from a love of which , if not from a re - ductive reminiscence of Biblical phraseology , they have also now and then found favor with prose writers of the same period .

		Lord Macaulay has , to be sure , the verse , `` Which none but he can wield '' ; but has he allowed himself a similar construction anywhere in his essays , history , or letters ?

		Dr.
Latham	PERSON	, in his edition of
Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary , adducing , in connection with the point under discussion , '' we are all ready but he '' and '' we are all ready but 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Mm '' says that , '' in writing , the nominative is the com - moner . ''

		In proof of this assertion , he gives , however , only one quotation , and that is from
Cowper	PERSON	's ''
John Gilpin	PERSON	, `` whobuthe ? ''

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, in illustration of what he considers to be modern usage , proposes , in the '' New English Dic - tionary '' : '' Is there anyone in the house but she ?

		-LRB- or but her ? -RRB-

		Who could have done it but he ?

		-LRB- or but him ? -RRB- ''

		Where Dr.
Murray	PERSON	hesitates , Dr.
William Smith	PERSON	and Mr.
Theophilus D. Hall	PERSON	, in their popular English Gram - mar , distinctly disapprove .

		Parenthetically , I am aware of the speculation that , in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` who hath any cause to mourn but we f '' as in like cases , possibly , '' but is used as a passive participle with nominative absolute . ''

		So the Rev. Dr.
E. A. Abbott	PERSON	, in his Shakespearian grammar -LRB- ed .

		1871 -RRB- , p. 81 .

		Mr.
C. P. Mason	PERSON	, in his English Grammar -LRB- ed .

		1881 -RRB- , has , in a foot-note to p. 124 : '' ' Ne nis na god buten he ' = ' there is no God but he -LSB- is God -RSB- . '

		This shows that but may be followed by a nominative case , provided the ellipse can be filled up so as to allow of its oc - currence in the complete sentence . '

		Nobody knows it but he ' = ' Nobody knows it but he -LSB- knows it -RSB- . '

		It is equally correct to say ' Nobody knows it but him ; only but is then a preposi - tion , and but him forms a limiting adjunct to nobody . ''

		`` Nobody knows it but he -LSB- knows it -RSB- , '' without punc - tuation , as transcribed , is unmeaning .

		Nor does the interposition of a semicolon after '' it '' mend matters ; for how can he know it , if nobody knows it ?

		Who can say that sophistry may not next equate '' I saw nobody but him '' with '' I saw nobody but -LSB- I saw -RSB- him , '' and attempt to do away altogether with but as a prep - osition ?

		To argue as Mr.
Mason	PERSON	does is to no prac - tical purpose .

		Neither analogy nor ancient prescrip - tion , but only the concensus of good modern writers , could legitimate but he for our ordinary service .

		This , also , merely in passing .

		The fact is , that but he , but she , but we , and but they , preceded by anyone , everyone , nobody , none , all , etc. , are not , in our time , conspicuously common .

		The case stand - ing thus , '' we are all ready but he '' and '' we are all ready but him '' being propounded for option , '' it is probable , '' according to Dr.
Latham	PERSON	, '' that few persons could tell , without reflection , which of the two he -LSB- read they -RSB- would give . ''

		Nevertheless , most persons would , I surmise , involuntarily choose , rather than '' nobody was there but / , '' `` nobody was there but me '' ; though , much more frequently , they would , in a like connection , use except me , or besides me , instead of but me .

		Contrast , too , '' anybody but she would consent '' with '' no one was to blame but me , '' in
Thackeray	PERSON	's ''
Esmond	PERSON	, '' ch .

		xiv .

		Accordingly , I doubt whether '' none but they '' and '' nobody but / , '' which , in the diction of prose , were , already in Gray 's age , dropping out of literary cur - rency , are , for us , `` altogether faultless . ''

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liams has by no means proved that , for everyday em - ployment , they are '' as good English as there is . ''

		Let versifiers avail themselves of them , if they please , still I am disposed to think that such locutions should be avoided by others .

		Not a few long-established modes of speech , as '' whom do men say that I am ? ''

		we cer - tainly do well in cashiering .

		That things of this kind , though ever so objectionable , possess an obstinate vital - ity , is a matter of course .

		`` Between you and 7 '' de - forms the pages of many an author that has , in the main , acquitted himself meritoriously .

		And here , as curiosi - ties , are two quotations for grammar quite as infirm : `` By the mere
Law of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, no one is bound by the act of another except he who is the successor of his property . ''

		On going afresh through the voluminous notes of which I formerly worked up a part , in criticizing the language of
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, I discover , in a group of them which would have suited my purpose , if it had struck my eye opportunely , two , in particular .

		I refer to the passages which Mr.
Williams	PERSON	cites , containing , respectively , `` none but she '' and `` any men but they . ''

		Expressions matching these I have observed in
Sheri	LOCATION	- dan ,
Eliot Warburton	PERSON	, Sir
G. W. Dasent	PERSON	, and others .

		High as was , and as still is , my esteem for
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's English , I can not regard his '' none but she '' and '' any men but they '' as very much better than , for instance , his `` an human , '' `` an hymn , '' `` is dead of a fever , '' '' another from , '' `` anywhere than , '' `` the hitherto editions , '' '' has drank , '' '' helpmeet , '' and '' conventical '' for '' conventicular . ''

		To conclude , I would here once more frankly ac - knowledge that '' Modern English , '' which was published twenty years ago , is not free from grave defects .

		It is a book of which I am not in the least degree proud ; and any genuine exposure of its mistakes I shall always welcome , as subserving the interests of truth .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	now has my second answer to his reiterated inquiry , '' Has F. H. ever erred ? ''

		F H Marlesford ,
England	LOCATION	,
Sept. 4 , 1893	DATE	.

		P. S .

		As concerns `` there is one God , and there is none other but he , '' but , when it follows none other , no other , no one else , etc. , is equivalent to than , and is , to this day , sometimes substituted for it .

		Other and else , not their qualificatives , are there constructed with but .

		May it not be that some moderns , failing to perceive this , have given in to no one but he , on the hasty sup - position of its being on all fours with none other but he ?

		To the same category as the ungrammatical '' I saw no man but he '' belongs the subjoined sentence from Cardinal Newman : '' Certainly , I am one among a thousand , all of them wrong but I. '' -LRB- '' Discussions , '' etc. , -LSB- 1872 -RSB- p. 6 . -RRB-

		If Shakespeare were not an ancient , a parallel to this would be offered in his '' what stays had I but they f '' Even experts occasionally slip with respect to cases of pronouns , by prescribing them wrongly .

		Thus , Pro- fessor
Adams S. Hill	PERSON	, quoting , from
Burke	PERSON	, '' it will be , by some one abler than me , demonstrated , '' etc. , would have '' than me '' replaced by '' than / . ''

		THE English law of copyright is thus characterized by a correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Atheuseum '' : '' The whole law of copyright abounds with the most subtle distinctions , and all sorts of arguments are capable of being advanced in every case that arises , and not al - ways on the merits either , to defeat the opposite party .

		No wonder people avoid going to law on a question of copyright .

		The expense is usually very great , the wear and tear past relief , the point in dispute in nine cases out of ten practically unimportant , and the result so un - certain that if the few litigants there could be per - suaded to settle their differences by an appeal to the first intelligent person they met in the street , they would show a considerable amount of common sense .

		THE DIAL 181 Nefo Boofes .

		AMERICAN HISTORY FROM AX ENGLISH STANDPOINT .

		* Into a compact octavo of three hundred pages Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	has measurably suc - ceeded , by dint of a sort of mental tour de force , in compressing the pith and rationale of the political history of the
United States	LOCATION	from
1492	DATE	to
1871	DATE	.

		His book is by no means a piece of literary joiner-work .

		It is a spirited , log - ically coherent narrative , conceived in the phil - osophical spirit of the historical essay , and studded throughout with graphic pictures of leading men and events .

		Much historical de - tail is of course omitted ; but the extreme suc - cinctness of the work is , after all , largely due to the author 's mastery of his theme , and to his ability to condense into an epigram what he well might have spun out into a page .

		The book is not free from minor errors of fact , - such , for instance , as the crediting of the Charter Oak episode to
Providence	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and the average American reader who has drawn his ideas from what Mr.
Smith	PERSON	terms panegyrical histories will certainly dissent from some of its conclusions .

		But in the main the work is as sound as it is lucid and animated ; and to the student of our history it will prove an invaluable aid in securing that grasp of the whole attainable only through a rapid survey < -RRB- f essentials .

		In the preface the author states that his sketch is intended chiefly for English readers ; for '' an American , being familiar with the main facts and general relations of parties , would look for details . ''

		American familiarity with the '' main facts '' is not likely , we think , to check American curiosity as to Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's version of them ; and the book seems to us , presupposing as it often does a knowledge of what it omits or merely glances at , to be better suited to American readers than to those for whom it is especially '' intended . ''

		Of the five chapters into which the contents are divided , the first treats of the Colonial period , the second of that of the Revolution , the third and fourth review the history of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	from
Washington	LOCATION	's presidency to the outbreak of the Civil War , and the fifth is devoted to the epoch of '' Rupture and Reconstruction . ''

		Of especial interest and force are the por - traits and characterizations of prominent men , * THE UNITED STATES : An Outline of
Political History	ORGANIZATION	, 1492-1871 .

		By
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, D.C.L.
New York	LOCATION	:
Mac - millan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		from
Franklin	LOCATION	to
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		It is here perhaps that the author excels .


Washington	LOCATION	,
Hamil	PERSON	- ton ,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Clay	ORGANIZATION	,
Jackson	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Cal	LOCATION	- houn , and others , are sketched with a bold yet discriminating hand , and usually with a whole - some qualification of conventional ideals .

		The list is appropriately headed with
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	the `` destined harbinger of the Rev - olution , '' an '' offspring of
New England Puri	LOCATION	- tanism grown mellow '' : '' His commercial shrewdness , his practical invent - iveness , his fundamental integrity , his public spirit , his passion for improvement , were native to his community in the phase which it had now reached , no less than were his ' Poor
Richard	PERSON	' philosophy of life and the absence in him of anything spiritual or romantic .

		He it was who in his boyhood had suggested to his father that much time might be saved by saying grace at once over the whole barrel of red herrings . ''

		In marked contrast to the thrifty New En gland sage was
Patrick Henry	PERSON	: '' This man had tried various ways of earning a liveli - hood , and had failed in all .

		He was bankrupt at twenty - three , and lounged in thriftless idleness , till he found that though he could not live by industry , he could live by his eloquent tongue ...
Henry	PERSON	's first ex - ploit as a barrister was a successful defence of the spoliation of the clergy , an unpopular order , by an ap - peal to public passion against legal right .

		Civil dis - cord brought him at once to the front .

		... It is no wonder that
Patrick Henry	PERSON	could so vividly por - tray to his audience the attitude of a slave .

		From the beginning to the end of his life he was a slaveholder , he bought slaves , he sold slaves , and by his will , with his cattle , he bequeathed slaves .

		A eulogist says of him that he could buy or sell a horse or a negro as well as anybody .

		That he was in some degree conscious of the inconsistency does not alter the fact .

		Other patriot orators besides
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, when they lavished the terms slave and slavery in their revolutionary harangues , might have reflected that they had only to look round them in order to see what real slaves and slavery were . ''

		Scarcely better than the Boanergic Virginian phrase-maker fares
John Adams	PERSON	, `` chief fo - menter of the revolutionary quarrel in
New England	LOCATION	'' : '' This man had failed in business as a maltster and as a tax collector , but he succeeded as a political agita - tor , and has found a shrine in American history as a pa - triot saint .

		Though an enthusiast he was not wanting in the astuteness of the politician .

		The latest of his American biographers can not help surmising that his puritan conscience must have felt a twinge when in the very time at which he had devoted himself body and soul to breaking the link that bound
America	LOCATION	to En - gland , he was coining for this or that body phrases full of reverence for the king and rejecting the thought of independence . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	does not forget , however , to note subsequently that it was owing to the '' honesty and wisdom of
John Adams	PERSON	'' that the recogni - tion of private debts was obtained from the gen - 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, eral government after independence was won .

		Ample justice is rendered to the picturesque figure and character of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, '' the Congressman from
Tennessee	LOCATION	, of gaunt frame and grim aspect , with elf locks hanging over his face and his hair tied behind in an eel skin , and so hot in temper that when he tried to speak his utterance was choked by pas - sion '' : ``
Jackson	PERSON	, although he had once been in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and had vented his jealous spleen on
Washington	LOCATION	, was a fighter , with an iron will and great powers of com - mand , ill educated , destitute of the knowledge and the habits of a statesman , with an uncontrolled temper , and almost as much swayed by passion as any Indian chief , though , like many an Indian chief , he could bear him - self with dignity and even with grace .

		That he had beaten the British at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, was his title to the headship of the nation ... But a greater force even than that of military renown was bearing on
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	to the Presidency .

		Hitherto the Republic had not been democratic .

		The common people had been content with their votes and had left government to an aristocracy of intellect drawn largely from the bar .

		But they desired to govern .

		They were beginning to suspect that they were fooled by intellect and to wish to see one of themselves in power .


Andrew Jackson	PERSON	was one of themselves ; he was not only the old hero but ' Old Hickory , ' a plain honest man who would gov - ern by a good homely rule , sweep away abuses , and see that no more tricks were played by superior cunning upon the people .

		To rule , a multitude must be incar - nate in a man , and the American multitude was incar - nate in
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	. ''

		Continuing , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	says of the inaugura - tion of Jacksonian rule : '' The seat of government having been stormed by General
Jackson	PERSON	and his train was at once given up to pillage .

		... A ruthless proscription swept the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	to make places for
Jackson	PERSON	's political soldiery .

		... No merit or record would save you ... Those who could get access to
Jackson	PERSON	had a chance of escap - ing by appeals to his vanity .

		One official is said to have saved his head by begging for the old hero 's old pipe .

		Thus was inaugurated the spoils system , together with the trade of place-hunting , by a President who came probably with a sincere desire of clearing govern - ment from corruption and of making simple honesty the rule , and of whom it must in justice be said that his own hands were perfectly clean . ''

		The social orgy that accompanied
Jackson	PERSON	's installation is graphically described : `` After the inauguration came a reception .

		There was orange punch by the barrelful , but as the waiters opened the door a rush was made , the glasses were broken , the pails of liquor were upset , and the sem - blance of order could be restored only by carrying tubs of punch into the garden to draw off the crowd from the rooms .

		Men stood in muddy boots on the damask - covered chairs to get a sight of the President . '

		The reign of King Mob seemed triumphant , ' says Judge Story , who was glad to escape from the scene . ''

		In short , Old Hickory '' went in '' amid a storm of disorder almost rivalling that of a heated ses - sion of the
British House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	though our author does not make the comparison .


William Henry Harrison	PERSON	, the -LRB- largely in - voluntary -RRB- hero of the coon - skin , log - cabin , , and hard - cider campaign , a candidate popu - larly believed to be even more enchantingly plebeian than Old Hickory himself , is summar - ily treated : '' But
Jackson	PERSON	's success had taught the wire-pullers the value of availability ... An available man they found , and a counter-charm in all respects to the ' Old Hero ' and ' Old Hickory , ' in ' Old Tippecanoe , ' the name which , most happily for electioneering purposes , they gave to
William Harrison	PERSON	, a worthy old country gentleman in
Ohio	LOCATION	, who in a combat at
Tippecauoe	ORGANIZATION	gained a victory over the Indians ... ' Tippecanoe ' va - cated life and the Presidency a month after his inaugur - ation . ''

		The midsummer madness of the '' hard-cider campaign '' naturally strikes Mr.
Smith	PERSON	with wonder : '' What the Harrisonian frenzy denotes in its relation to American character it is not easy to say .

		Had the American people traversed in half a century the whole distance between the phlegmatic Englishman and the wild shouter for Tippeeanoe , or was this strange out - burst of political poetry a recoil from a too prosaic life ? ''

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, we remember , was moved to a sim - ilar question by the spectacle of some 60,000 ordinarily rational men marching ankle-deep in the mud to the inspiring refrain of ''
Blaine	PERSON	,
Blaine	PERSON	,
James G. Blaine	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		The author justly devotes much space to
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	who '' of all American statesmen , '' he thinks , `` has left the deepest im - pression on the character of his people '' : '' Their political ideas and hopes , their notions about their own destiny and the part which - they are to play in the drama of humanity , have been his ... Yet with all his outward simplicity the Virginian magnate and man of letters , though he might be a Republican , could not in himself be a true embodiment of democ - racy .

		He was the friend of the people , but not one of them .

		From him to the rough warrior of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, the hard-cider drinking pioneer of
Ohio	LOCATION	, and the rail - splitter of
Illinois	LOCATION	, there was still a long road to be travelled ...
Jefferson	PERSON	's wand was the pen .

		Yet he is strangely apt to fall into mixed metaphors and even into platitudes .

		This address -LSB- the inaugural -RSB- has not escaped criticism .

		A constellation goes before the peo - ple and guides their steps .

		In the sequel the constel - lation becomes a creed , a text , a touchstone , and should the people wander from their ' touchstone ' they are conjured to ' retrace their steps and regain the road . '

		In the genius of a man who made so vast an impres - sion on such a nation we must believe , yet it is some - times an exercise of faith to believe in the genius of
Jefferson	LOCATION	for anything but party management and per - sonal fascination . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's estimate of
Henry Clay	PERSON	, the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 anti-British '' war-hawk '' leader , naturally falls considerably short of the traditional one : '' Clay was perhaps the first consummate party leader of the Congressional and platform type .

		He was a paragon of the personal fascination now styled magnet - ism .

		Magnetic , indeed , his manner and voice must have been if they could make the speeches that he has left us pass for the most cogent reasoning and the high - est eloquence ... His power of winning the hearts of men was unique .

		When at last he missed his prize by losing the election for the Presidency his partisans wept like children ; one of them is said to have died of grief .

		He was ardently patriotic , after the war-hawk fashion , but the Presidency was always in his thoughts and its attraction accounts for the perturbations of his political orbit .

		He said that he would rather be right than be President ; but it has been too truly remarked that even at the moment of that memorable utterance he was thinking more of being President than of being right .

		His policy and sentiments were intensely Amer - ican , and by the cosmopolitans would now be designated as jingo . ''

		The portrait of
Washington	LOCATION	does not mate - rially differ from the familiar one though the following unpalatable , if too true , passage re - calls
Carlyle	PERSON	's threat to '' take
George	PERSON	down a peg or two '' : ''
Washington	LOCATION	insisted that his officers should be gen - tlemen , not men fit to be shoe-blacks .

		He drew a most undemocratic distinction between the officer and the pri - vate soldier ... He says that the soldier should be satisfied to serve for his food , clothes , and pay , and com - plains that he can not lay on the back of the insubordin - ate patriot more than one hundred lashes , holding that five hundred are not too many . ''

		With a view , perhaps , of turning the virtues of the Father of his Country partly to British account , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	continues : '' Some American writers seem anxious to prove that
Washington	LOCATION	's character is essentially different from that of an English gentleman .

		About this we need not dis - pute .

		The character of an English gentleman is cer - tainly devoid of any traits that might be derived either from a plantation or from a war with Indians in the backwoods .

		Yet an English gentleman sees in Wash - ington his ideal as surely as he does not see it in
Frank	LOCATION	- lin ,
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, or
Patrick Henry	PERSON	. ''

		Certainly few will deny that
Washington	LOCATION	had more in common with
Hamilton	PERSON	-LRB- the high-bred statesman who answered a democratic senti - ment by striking the table and saying , '' Your people , sir , your people is a great beast ! '' -RRB-

		than with '' Tippecanoe '' or '' Old Hickory '' or even with the rail-splitter of
Illinois	LOCATION	, who in some respects towers above them all .


Daniel Webster	PERSON	, Mr.
Smith	PERSON	thinks , '' as an orator of reason , has no superior if he has an equal in the English language '' : '' It is difficult at least to say what political speech can vie in logical force and impressiveness with his .

		speech defending the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in reply to the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	.

		separatist
Hayne	PERSON	, or what forensic speech excels in the same qualities his speech for the prosecution in the mur - der case of White . ''

		After quoting from the former speech Mr.
Smith	PERSON	adds : '' These words thrilled through all American hearts at the same time , remained engraved on all American hearts forever ... He swayed the opinions of all men ; but he did not , like Clay , win their hearts .

		He never was a great party leader , nor was he ever a hopeful can - didate for the Presidency .

		It must be added that his moral strength was not equal to his power of mind .

		In regard to the great moral question of slavery , his de - sire of the Presidency at last overcame his principle . ''

		After briefly depicting the characters of Ben - ton and
Calhoun	PERSON	, Mr.
Smith	PERSON	passes on to Ran - dolph : '' A Virginian of high family , with more than the ar - rogance of his class , who used to come into the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in his hunting-dress with his hunting whip in his hand , and behave as if he were in his kennel ; a man of nat - ural ability , without good sense or power of self-control , firmly attached to no party or even opinion , keen and reckless in invective , the terror of those at whom his lean finger was pointed in debate , at last a political wreck and almost a maniac .

		Randolph sometimes told wholesome truths in a pungent way . ''

		It is upon
Lincoln	PERSON	that the author bestows his most unstinted and heart-felt praise : ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	is assuredly one of the marvels of history .

		No land but
America	LOCATION	has produced his like .

		This destined chief of a nation in its most perilous hour was the son of a thriftless and wandering settler , bred in the most sordid poverty ... He had a strong and eminently fair understanding , with great powers of pa - tient thought which he cultivated by the study of Euclid .

		In all his views there was a simplicity which had its source in the simplicity of his character ... Both as an advocate and as a politician he was ' honest Abe . '

		As an advocate he would throw up his brief when he knew that his case was bad .

		... He said himself that he had not controlled events , but had been guided by them .

		To know how to be guided by events , however , if it is not imperial genius , is practical wisdom .

		Lincoln 's goodness of heart , his sense of duty , his unselfishness , his freedom from vanity , his long-suffering , his simpli - city , were never disturbed either by power or by opposi - tion .

		... To the charge of levity no man could be less open .

		Though he trusted in
Providence	LOCATION	, care for the public and sorrow for the public calamities filled his heart and sat visibly upon his brow .

		His State papers are excellent , not only as public documents , but as com - positions , and are distinguished by their depth of hu - man feeling and tenderness from those of other states - men .

		He spoke always from his own heart to the heart of the people .

		His brief funeral oration over the graves of those who had fallen in the war is one of the gems of the language . ''

		Of paramount interest to Americans will be the author 's account of the struggle for inde - pendence and of the causes that lead up to it .

		Here Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's conflicting sympathies have made his task a hard one .

		He has evidently meant to be impartial ; but the American reader , fed on what Mr.
Smith	PERSON	terms the pane - 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	gyrical histories , will certainly lament a ten - dency throughout this chapter to show the seamy side of the Colonial coat , to belittle Co - lonial motives and Colonial successes , and to explain away British reverses .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	seems to us , we confess , loth to admit that the colonists were capable of grasping a prin - ciple fully at first , or of fighting for it steadily afterwards .

		He lays perhaps too much stress upon Colonial '' niggardliness and fractious - ness , '' and too little upon parliamentary greed .

		The specious and familiar plea of the French War expenses is urged , and the colonists ' re - ply that the war was forced on them and was in fact largely paid for by them in blood and treasure , is omitted .

		Besides , the French War had nothing to do with the constitutional point involved .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	finally admits , however , that the tea-tax -LRB- a measure insidiously framed to smuggle in a principle fatal to American liberties -RRB- was resisted , not because it was bur - densome , but because it was illegally laid .

		It seems to us , on the whole , pretty well settled that the prime cause of the rupture the vio - lence of which , only , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	laments was the sudden awakening of British greed to the prosperity -LRB- and therefore the taxability -RRB- of the once ignored , colonies .

		We need not , however , multiply arguments that will suggest themselves to every American reader , but we shall devote our remaining space to brief cita - tion from the author 's account of the matter .

		That the cause of the revolt was not , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	thinks , `` general oppression by the mother coun - try seems clear . ''

		But he goes on to say : '' The restrictions upon Colonial trade and manufac - tures were a cause for the most reasonable discontent .

		The restrictions on trade might be excused by the dom - inant fallacies of a protectionist era and palliated by the commercial privileges and bounties which the col - onies enjoyed .

		Those on manufactures were without palliation or excuse , imposed solely in the interest of the manufacturer at home .

		These grievances , if redress had been obstinately refused , would have justified re - volt . ''

		We can not admit the author 's implication that , in the face of the sinister tea-tax , ministerial pledges against the re-imposition of specific duties were a guaranty against the results of a policy of fiscal extortion plainly entered into by a parliament which , to quote Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, '' Made itself the legislative organ of a commercial in - terest , animated by that blind and unscrupulous greed which has been the bane and disgrace of commerce and continues to animate the monopolist at the present day . ''

		Touching the measures of repression that followed the ''
Boston	LOCATION	Tea Party '' the author observes : '' They were passionate , indiscriminate , and insult - ing ; bolts of blind wrath launched across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	by men imperfectly informed as to the situation and ignorant of the character of the people , as transoceanic rulers must always be . ''

		Passing on to the war itself , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	does - not forget to observe that '' Never , not even under
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, did
England	LOCATION	make a worse show in the field , '' a plea which reminds us , we confess , of the familiar excuse of the de - feated pugilist that he was '' out of condition . '' ''

		Perhaps in the whole conflict , '' the author thinks , '' The three noblest things are the character of Wash - ington , the behavior of his army at
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	, and the devotion of the better class of loyalists . ''

		Commenting on the severe treatment of the loyalist class at the close of the war , he sig - nificantly adds : '' The loyalist exiles peopled
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	,
New Bruns	LOCATION	- wick , and
Upper Canada	LOCATION	with enemies of the new Re - public , and if a power hostile to the Republic should ever be formed under European influence in the north of the continent , the Americans will owe it to their an - cestors who refused amnesty to the vanquished in civil war . ''

		The execution of Andre is commented on with some severity ; and Mr.
Smith	PERSON	forgets to mention here that this deplorable observance of an unrelenting code was partly a Mosaic re - prisal for the hanging of
Nathan Hale	PERSON	.

		The following summary of the Revolutionary War is one of the few unfortunate instances ia which the author allots his prejudices to in - fluence , if not , perhaps , his conclusions , at least his manner of stating them .

		The passage ha & an ungenerous , even a peevish , ring : '' No conflict in history has made more noise than the Revolutionary War .

		It set flowing on every fourth of
July	DATE	a copious stream of panegyrical rheloric which ha * only just begun to subside .

		Everything connected with it has been the object of a fond exaggeration .

		stantial basis upon which some of our boldest railway projects were undertaken .

		The ill - timed character of many of these enterprises , and the destructive methods of management pursued by so many of our early railway man - ipulators , destined the expectations of the for - eign investor to frequent and bitter disappoint - ment .

		And when the awakening came , as it did , once in the seventies , and again in the eighties , a confident hopefulness which never had a rational basis was followed by an excess of timidity which was quite as irrational though not less natural .

		A succession of chills was sent through the European market for Amer - ican investments , from the last of which recov - ery is still to come .

		Few of our railroad se - curities to-day enjoy the credit in the European market to which their intrinsic merit fairly en - titles them .

		The English investor who contents himself with three and four per cent on Brit - ish and French railroad stock , demands a net return of from four to five and one-half per cent from American railroad bonds .

		This dif - ference in tlje credit of securities possessing the same essential qualities can not be altogether explained by the fact that the course of English prices for our securities is held down by the American quotation ; it is due , first and last , to lack of confidence a lack of confidence which , because of its exaggerated nature , is as prejudicial to the real interests of the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean investor as it is injurious to the market for American securities .

		Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	, an Englishman , has in his work on `` American Railroads and Invest - ments '' made an attempt to remove this dis - trust and to enable the European investor to appreciate the advantage of American railway investments , by supplying him the material for the formation of an intelligent estimate of their character and worth .

		In executing his task , however , Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	has produced a book that will have an interest for a much wider cir - cle of readers than the investing public ; and it is this feature that entitles his work to more extended notice .

		It is not only a storehouse of information regarding the history , manage - ment , and affairs of the forty-five leading rail - road companies brought under review , but it is altogether the best discussion of the general conditions , past and present , affecting the value of American railroad securities , with which we are acquainted .

		On this side it may be re - garded as a contribution of importance to a de - partment of railroad economics that has never received adequate attention .

		It is not the work 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, of a scientific investigator , but it is a clear , strong , discriminating , and impartial examina - tion of an important part of the subject-matter of railway finance .

		There are three principal points of view from which the activities of the railroad may be studied , and each of these corresponds to a different set of relations sustained by the rail - road to those interested in it .

		These are , re - spectively , the relations of the railroad to the shipper , to the investor , and to the state .

		The interests of the shipper and of the investor have usually been treated as distinct and separate , and they are very generally supposed to be an - tagonistic .

		In fact , however , these two inter - ests are closely interlaced , and require , for their complete understanding , to be studied in com - bination .

		What is called the '' railroad prob - lem '' is , on the scientific side , little more than a search after the principle determining the true equilibrium of these two interests , and , on the practical side , the effort to strike the bal - ance between them .

		-LRB- Those who despair of solving the problem hope at lea * st to destroy it by dissolving one of the interests and substi - tuting state ownership and management . -RRB-

		But most writers have approached the question with little direct reference to the investor ; and thus , despite its undoubted importance for a full com - prehension of all the equities of the case , the subject of railway finance has been neglected .

		A few brief allusions to the complexities of railroad accounting , and an explanation of the juggle by which a road could conceal and sup - port an unsound financial condition by charg - ing dividends to construction account , have hith - erto been thought sufficient .

		And a similar indifference to the interests of the investor has characterized the attitude of government , at any rate in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In
England	LOCATION	, as a result of the revelations of the railway panic of
1866	DATE	, the Railway Securities Act was passed , to provide some protection to the inves - tor against the recurrence of similar abuses .

		But in
America	LOCATION	, the investor , representing , ac - cording to recent statistics , a nominal capital of not less than ten billions , or one-tenth of the nation 's wealth , was left to devise his own safe - guards .

		By a very natural blunder , it was thought not to be possible to materially advance the interests of the investor without injuring those of the public .

		The investor , it was ar - gued , is interested in high rates and pools to maintain them ; the shipper , on .

		the contrary , in low rates and the competition that produces them .

		The public has failed to grasp the con - nection between revenue and rates ; the error it has persistently made is in supposing that large revenues imply high rates .

		The fact that this conclusion was contradicted by the whole history of railway development in
America	LOCATION	counted for nothing , because it accorded so com - pletely with popular prejudice against the '' money power . ''

		But the public was not alone in the error .

		The investor has seldom taken a more accurate view of his relations to the shipper through the medium of rates .

		The as - serted antagonism has also been accepted by him as an undoubted fact .

		And now the au - thor of the present work has brought the weight of his authority to the support of the view '' that with regard to rates the interest of the railways are conflicting with those of the pub - lic . ''

		The railroad is simply typical of that large and growing class of industries in which permanent investment represents a heavy pro- portion of total working capital .

		Of these in - dustries as a class it is true that expenses do not vary proportionately with changes in the volume of business ; and it is to them that the important half-truth contained in the maxim '' quick sales and low profits '' is particularly applicable .

		But it is true in an especial de - gree of the railroad , that the expense per unit of traffic diminishes as the volume of traffic increases .

		And it is equally true that the amount of traffic varies inversely with rates , a low rate stimulating and a high rate retard - ing transportation .

		Rates , therefore , are only one of three elements affecting the net revenue of the railroad , the other two being expenses and traffic .

		To put the conclusion in the form of a mathematical statement , we might say that railway revenue is a fraction of three variables : expenses , rates , and traffic .

		And it will be seen to follow from this , that only within nar - row limits does the railway find its interest in fixing rates higher than the public interest re - quires .

		There is , therefore , little room or oc - casion for friction between the shipper and the investor .

		Of several different rates producing the same amount of gross revenue , the highest is obviously the most advantageous to the in - vestor ; for aggregate expenses then being rel - atively low , the margin of net revenue is in - creased .

		The highest rate that yields the max - imum revenue would seem to be the rule which an exclusive regard for the interest of the in - vestor prescribes to the railway management in fixing rates .

		What this rate would be in any particular case could only be experiment - ally determined , and then only with great dif -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 ficulty .

		The lowest of the maximum revenue rates , on the other hand , most nearly accords with the interest of the shipper .

		Between those two limits rates might oscillate , the point at which temporary equilibrium would be reached being determined by the multitude of circumstances giving now the railroad and now the shipper the advantage of position in the bargaining .

		But the public would seldom find it to its per - manent interest to depress rates below the max - imum revenue point .

		This would endanger the value of the investor 's interest ; and any - thing that tends to render returns upon rail - way investments inadequate is certain to react injuriously on the shipper 's interest .

		The common complaint of railroads nearly everywhere in the
United States	LOCATION	to-day is that their earnings do not suffice to enable them to distribute '' fair '' dividends among their stock - holders .

		The fact to which they point as be - ing both the evidence and the cause of this con - dition is the low level of rates which rules here .

		Rates are , indeed , extremely low in this country , the average rate per ton-mile in
1890	DATE	being considerably less than
one cent	MONEY	.

		Rates here are forty per cent lower than in
England	LOCATION	, and almost as low as in
Holland	LOCATION	, where , owing to excessive water competition , rates are lower than any - where else in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Equally significant is the rapidity with which the decline in rates has taken place .

		We have no exact statistics , but the experiences of two typical American roads , the
New York Central	ORGANIZATION	in the East and the
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	in the
West	LOCATION	, seems to warrant the con - clusion that freight rates have declined about seventy-five per cent since the war ; and we have positive evidence that they have fallen no less than
twenty-five per cent	MONEY	in the past twelve years .

		It is not surprising that such facts should be seized upon by managers to show why railroads are not more remunerative .

		It is a matter of great difficulty to trace the influ - ence of rates on earnings , but it may be confi - dently asserted that rates in the
United States	LOCATION	are considerably below the maximum revenue point .

		It is no sufficient answer to the con - tention of the railroads to say that the decline in rates has been compensated by the great growth of business .

		Mere increase of traffic could not of itself have saved the investor against the inevitable effects of declining rates .

		Earn - ings per mile of railway is the best , and indeed the only real , indication of the financial pros - perity of the road .

		Now , while there has been an almost phenomenal growth in the volume vof business during the past ten years a gain amounting to no less than
one hundred per cent	MONEY	in the case of freight traffic there has been a steady decline of net earnings per mile .

		A part of the increase of traffic has no doubt been counterbalanced by the increase of mile - age ; but when due allowance has been made for the complication introduced by this factor , it still appears that , with a net gain of about thirty-three and
one-third per cent	MONEY	of freight traffic alone over new mileage , there has been a decline of no less than twenty per cent in net earnings per mile .

		The increase in traffic has thus been more than offset by the decline in rates .

		And the reduction of net earnings would have been still greater had it not been for the marvellous economies effected in the cost of moving freight .

		Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	states the situation accurately when he says that '' to offset the serious decline of earnings in spite of growing business has been the problem rail - road men in
America	LOCATION	found themselves con - fronted with . ''

		They have met the difficulty partly , but not altogether successfully , by cut - ting down the cost of transportation per ton - mile about one-half within the past twenty years .

		While , then , the enormous decline in rates produced a serious pro-rate reduction in the earnings from a given volume of traffic , the coincident concurrence of the two phenom - ena of growing business and cheapened cost prevented the margin of profits from being wiped out , and thus maintained the railways on a hardly less remunerative basis than for - merly .

		And to this extent the force of the contention that the constant decline of rates explains the inability of the railroads to earn '' adequate '' returns upon their capital is ob - viously weakened ; and more especially is the moral force of the contention destroyed when it is recalled that the railroads as a class are themselves largely responsible for the decline of rates which was simply the inevitable con - sequence of excessive construction and over - supply of transportation facilities .

		The American public has never been seri - ously disposed to deny the justice of the rail - roads ' claim to earn adequate returns ; but it has refused to adopt the standard of adequacy proposed by the railroads .

		The people were not long in learning to appreciate the distinc - tion between returns upon capital invested and dividends on stock issued .

		They admitted the claim of the railroads with reference to the for - mer , but vigorously denied it as to the latter ; and , on the whole , with reason .

		The public knows that a formidable proportion of the cap - 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, .

		ital now nominally represented by American railways is fictitious .

		It is probably a conserv - ative estimate that places the proportion of '' water '' that was injected into the issues of American railroad companies , in the days when they were under the domination of cliques , at one-third of the total capitalization .

		But what - ever the proportion , it is safe to say , none of the abuses that have surrounded the financial management of American railways has done more to discredit their claims in the eyes of the public , and more certainly has been more pre - judicial to the interests of the bonajide inves - tor , than the evil of stock-watering .

		Not a few American railroads are still struggling with the difficulties emanating from this source .

		It is the immense amount of '' water '' they are car - rying that makes it impossible for some roads to bear up successfully under the pressure of declining rates .

		Excessive capitalization and excessive construction have been the twin evils , financially considered , of American railways .

		The latter has driven rates down , and the for - mer has kept dividends low .

		It is unnecessary to dwell on the various methods of stock - wa - tering developed by the ingenuity of American manipulators .

		It is more important to recall that the evil was one for which the laxity of the law was partly responsible .

		Nowhere else do railway directors enjoy such vast discretion - ary powers as in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The law to this day imposes no serious restrictions upon their power to issue bonds and shares , to declare or pass dividends .

		The power has seldom been abused in the issue of bonds , but the extent to which share-capital was inflated to support speculative intrigues may be gathered from Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	's hardly exaggerated statement that '' the majority of companies realized nothing for the shares they issued in their early days . ''

		The distinction between bonds and stock is an important one in American railway finance .

		The bondholder is a preferred creditor of the company , secured by a pledge of its property , and receiving a stipulated interest upon his loan .

		The stockholder is the owner of the road , his stock entitling him to share in the net profits .

		Nearly all American railroads were built with borrowed capital , for which bonds were issued , it usually being impossible to find a sufficient number of mere stockholders to advance the money . ''

		To many , even bonds seemed no equivalent for their investment , and besides prior rights upon the property they also wished to possess control of the company ; and shares not being much sought after , it mat - tered little to the promoter whether he gave shares into the bargain with bonds or not . ''

		This was one of the most common and least ob - jectionable methods of stock-watering , although it frequently begot recklessness and dishonesty in the management of the property .

		Far more disastrous and reprehensible were fictitious is - sues of stock for the purpose of manipulating the market ; the payment of excessive prices for construction or for the purchase of other properties , for which bonds and stock were issued which the earnings of the company could not afterwards support .

		In these ways inves - tors wei-e deceived and plundered to carry out the '' deals '' of unscrupulous adventurers .

		But stock-watering may now be regarded as mainly an evil of the past .

		The great solidifi - cation of railway business and the undoubted improvement in the moral tone of railway man - agement , which have taken place in recent years , are a substantial guarantee that such malpractices as were common in the seventies will be difficult in the future .

		The only form of stock - watering of which we are likely to hear more is the issue of stock-dividends ; and , so - far as this is a device for concealing profits from public knowledge , it will be acceptable to the investor .

		There are even those among whom is Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	who think that , what - ever injury '' water '' may have been to inves - tors in the past , it is now a positive benefit . ''

		Water emphatically begets a desire on the - part of railway managers to charge such rates as will pay returns upon fictitious capital . ''

		This view seems to us to be unduly optimistic and ill-founded .

		It overlooks the fundamental conditions determining rates , and , again , the real nature of the relation of rates to revenue .

		The '' desires '' of railway managers do not make rates .

		The decline of rates in this country has been due to over-building and excessive com - petition , rather than to lack of energy on the - part of managers .

		Mr.
Van Oss	PERSON	, therefore , , writes very much more to the point when he says , '' The future remunerativeness of Amer - ican railways depends chiefly upon the extent of future construction . ''

		This is the question of present and future importance to the inves - tor ; but to this question no very certain an - swer can be given .

		Present indications , how - ever , are that most American railroads will pursue a very conservative building policy in the future .

		The '' boom '' days are not yet of the past , but we may safely expect that rail - road extension will hereafter be undertaken less in anticipation of possible development and
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL more in response to calculable needs .

		Rates have probably reached their lowest , and as the country gradually grows up to the capacities of existing systems we may look for a slow rise .

		The present movement toward consolidation of railroad properties will doubtless exert an im - portant and healthful influence in these direc - tions .

		Increasing traffic , rising rates , dimin - ishing cost , such will be the probable future of the conditions on which the remunerative - ness of the railroads depends .

		But while this much is fairly clear , it would be rash to ven - ture an opinion , much more a prediction , as to how near or remote this future is .

		A LIFE WORTH LIVING .

		* However cogent may be the pessimistic argu - ment for the worthlessness of life , it takes an essentially one-sided view of the matter .

		A man is not only an individual , but a factor in the social organism as well ; and the latter as - pect of his being is apt to be ignored by those who contend for the futility of human endeavor .

		In fact ,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	does imperfect justice even to the individual aspect of the problem , for he fails to give due weight to the individ - ual satisfaction of the altruistic life , to the deep inward joy that comes from strenuous endeavor towards the accomplishment of some worthy purpose , the joy to which we may deny the name of happiness only because that word is inadequate to give it expression , the joy for which
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	found the higher name of blessed - ness , and which Renan bade us seek when he gave us for a clue to the meaning of life that noble phrase : `` II ne s ` agit pas d'etre heureux ; il s ` agit d'etre parfait . ''

		And , if the pessim - ist 's view of life is thus discredited from the standpoint of individualism , it suffers all the more when examined from the standpoint of the social organization .

		Professor Huxley , in his Romanes lecture of
last May	DATE	, tells us that , '' However diverse their views on philosophical and re - ligious matters , most men are agreed that the propor - tion of good and evil in life may be very sensibly af - fected by human action .

		I never heard anybody doubt that the evil may be thus increased , or diminished ; and it would seem to follow that good must be similarly sus - ceptible of addition or subtraction .

		Finally , to my knowledge , nobody professes to doubt that , so far forth as we possess a power of bettering things , it is our par - amount duty to use it and to train all our intellect and energy to this supreme service of our kind . ''

		* THE LIFE AND WORK OF
JOHN RUSKIN	PERSON	.

		By
W. G. Col	PERSON	- lingwood ,
M.A.	LOCATION	Two volumes .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Miffiin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Viewed from this objective standpoint , a life is clearly worth living if it sensibly alters '' the proportion of good and evil in life '' to the ad - vantage of the good .

		And the cases can not be frequent in which such beneficent activity will fail to find its subjective value also , in the cre - ation of that state of ethical satisfaction which most serious souls have come to regard as more desirable than the palpable pleasures of sense , or even than the pure delights of the intellect .

		Some such reflections as these are sure to be aroused by a look at the life work of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, whose biography has recently been pre - pared for us by Mr.
W. G. Collingwood	PERSON	, for many years his private secretary .

		They are as far as possible removed from '' the barren op - timistic sophistries of comfortable moles , '' for they
spring	DATE	from a more searching analysis of life than mere optimism or mere pessimism has to offer .

		In the outlook of men like Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, with whom high thought and noble deed go ever hand in hand , neither optimism nor pessimism can be a word of much meaning , for such men are as far removed in temper from the com - placency of the one as from the despair of the other .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	displays , indeed , from time to time , those moods of .

		dejection from which few serious lives are wholly spared ; but with him the mood only serves to mark the transi - tion to some new phase of beneficent activity .

		Beginning with the beginning of
1871	DATE	, the first series of '' Fors , '' he says : '' I simply can not paint , nor read , nor look at min - erals , nor do anything else that I like ; and the very light of the
morning	TIME	sky , when there is any which is seldom , now-a-days , near
London	LOCATION	has become hateful to me , because of the misery that I know of , and see signs of where I know it not , which no imagination can interpret too bitterly . ''

		But he quickly adds , lest despondency alone should seem to have been the outcome of thirty years of observation of men and labor in their behalf , '' Therefore , as I have said , I will endure it no longer quietly ; but henceforward , with any few or many who will help , do my poor best to abate this misery .

		But that I may do my best , I must not be miserable myself any longer ; for no man who is wretched in his own heart , and feeble in his own work , can rightly help others . ''

		The literary charm with which Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	instinctively invests the most casual expression of his petulant moods , while it has brought his personality vividly before the minds of his readers , has also had the effect of obscuring their view of his serious work ; to a certain ex - tent it has produced a misleading impression of the dominant temper in which that work has .

		190 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, been done .

		It is the merit of Mr.
Colling	PERSON	- Wood 's biography to have given us an essen - tially objective view of its subject , and such a view is needed to counteract that which we get from the self - revelations of '' Fors '' and '' Prae - terita . ''

		Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's book is based upon a larger collection of materials than any pre - vious biographer has had at his disposal , as well as upon the results of long personal intercourse with Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	and participation in his work .

		It is a straightforward chronological narrative , marred now and then by the writer 's endeavor to be Ruskiniau on his own account , and occa - sionally uncritical in its acceptance of the most extreme Ruskinian doctrine , but a model , on the whole , of discreet and sympathetic delin - eation .

		It has a number of portraits and other illustrations , reproduces several hitherto un - published letters , and fills two octavo vol - umes , continuously paged .

		A minor point of excellence is found in the apt chapter-headings , such as the Rossettian : '' Sighing , I turned at last to win Once more the
London	LOCATION	dirt and din , '' which marks Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's transition from the role of art critic to that of social reformer , or the quotation from Ibsen '' Hush !

		you must not speak about it yet , but I have made a great discovery .

		The fact is that the strongest man upon earth is he who stands most alone '' which is used to characterize Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's atti - tude during the past quarter-century . ''

		The happiest lot on earth is to be born a Scotsman , '' says Mr.
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	; and the biographer places considerable emphasis upon Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's Scotch ancestry . ''

		The religious instinct so conspicuous in him is a heritage from
Scotland	LOCATION	; so is his conscience and code of mor - ality , part emotional , part logical , and often unlike an Englishman 's in the points that sat - isfy or shock it .

		The combination of shrewd common-sense and romantic sentiment ; the oscillation between levity and dignity , from caustic jest to tender earnest ; the restlessness , the fervor , the impetuosity , all these are char - acteristics of a Scotsman of parts , and highly developed in
Ruskin	LOCATION	. ''

		Possibly Mr.
Colling	PERSON	- wood makes too much of this notion of '' the recrudescence of the Celt , '' but it must be per - mitted to have some weight .

		The influence of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's parents had much to do with the development of his character , and his devotion to them while living , and to their memory af - terwards , finds many a beautiful illustration in his writings .

		Yet his intellectuality was too forceful to develop in any mould planned by others , and the inmost law of his being com - pelled him to grow away from the paths that his parents would gladly have seen him pursue to the end .

		The following is Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's comment upon this silent tragedy so common and so inevitable in an age , like ours , of rap - idly widening thought the tragedy that pro- vided Tourguenieff with a theme for one of his greatest works : '' The gradual enlargement of his ideas and sphere of thought involved a gradual estrangement from his pa - rents ; much more painful than any sudden revolt , be - cause then they would have known , so to speak , the worst , and some sort of reconciliation on a new basis would have been possible .

		As it was , they saw or thought they saw , for they could not tell how it would end their work being gradually undone , their cher - ished hopes frustrated , their intentions unfulfilled .

		And all their pride in his fame , and their confidence in his dutiful affection , could not hide the fact that , once launched on his life 's true career , he had drifted away from their track , out of their sight , voyaging through strange seas of thought , alone . ''

		Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	makes some excellent ob - servations upon Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's relations to the Pre-Raphaelites .

		Attention is called to the fact that , as a boy , when he first got permission to copy at the
Louvre	LOCATION	, he chose a Rembrandt .

		This shows , says the author , '' what the casual reader of his works on art might miss , that he is naturally a chiaroscurist , and that his praise of the Pre-Raphaelite color and draughtsman - ship is not prompted by his taste and native feeling so much as by intellectual judgment . ''

		We doubt , indeed , if it shows all this , but the incident is noteworthy .

		The following remarks may be given a less qualified assent : '' Pre-Raphaelitism was an unstable compound , liable to explode upon the experimenter , and its component parts to return to their old antithesis of crude naturalism on the one hand , and affectation , whether of piety or poetry or simple reactionary antiquarianism , on the other .

		And that Mr.
Ruskiu	PERSON	did not then foresee .

		All he knew was that , just when he was sadly leaving the scene ,
Turner	ORGANIZATION	gone and night coming on , new lights arose .

		It was really far more noteworthy that
Millais	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	and Hunt were men of genius , than that the ' principles ' they tried to illustrate were sound .

		And Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, always safe in his intuitions , divined their power , and generously applauded the dextrous troop in their unexpected lampadephoria . ''

		The Pre-Raphaelite episode is but one of many illustrations of adherence to the central prin - ciple of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's art teaching , '' the great doctrine that art can not be produced except by artists , ... that , just as
Socrates	PERSON	postponed the day of justice until philosophers should be kings , and kings philosophers , so
Ruskin	PERSON	post - poned the reign of art until workmen should be artists , and artists workmen . ''

Ruskin	PERSON	, whatever the vagaries of his criticism , has always been the uncompromising defender .

		In reading these volumes , one can not fail to be deeply impressed by the phenomenally va - ried activity of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's intellectual life .

		Of this we have a striking illustration in a let - ter to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, written at the age of thirty-six .

		The letter , which is too long for us to print , de - scribes the occupations of the year six hun - dred pages of '' Modern Painters , '' thirty new drawings , some etchings on steel , designs for the

''

		The prophetic aspect of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's thought , which was , during his later years , to overshadow all others , came frequently into view , even dur - ing the earlier years of art study and criticism .

		As early as
1845	DATE	, he wrote to
Joseph Severn	PERSON	in terms that showed clearly enough the direc - tion towards which his view of society was turning : `` With your hopes for the elevation of English art by means of fresco I can not sympathize .

		... It is not the material nor the space that can give us thoughts , passions , or power .

		I see on our Academy walls noth - ing but what is ignoble in small pictures , and would be disgusting in large ones .

		... It is not the love of fresco that we want ; it is the love of God and his creatures ; it is humility , and charity , and self-denial , and fasting , and prayer ; it is a total change of character .

		We want more faith and less reasoning , less strength and more trust .

		You want neither walls , nor plaster , nor colors ca nefait rien a Vaffaire : it is
Giotto	LOCATION	, and
Ghirlandajo	PERSON	, and Angelico that you want , and that you will and must want until this disgusting nineteenth century has .

		I ca n't say breathed , but steamed its last . ''

		All the promise of '' Fors '' was in these early vaticinations ; '' so early had he taken up , and wrapped around him , the mantle of
Cassan	PERSON	- dra . ''

		From this time on , his ethical ideals grew until they almost usurped the place of the merely artistic ideals with which he set out in his ca - reer .

		That this career was a consistent develop - ment from then until now is one of the main contentions of his biographer , and to have made this clear is not the least of Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's services .

		Near the close of the book , when dealing with the charge of insanity that has more than once been brought against Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin , the writer says : '' The careful student should be able to trace his genius , down to the end , in continuous and rational pro- gression .

		Passing over defined intervals of mental dis - ease , and allowing for vehemence of expression , partly characteristic , partly the temporary effect of the pen - umbra of the storm-cloud , his mental development , I make bold to say , is normal and logical throughout his life .

		And I believe that when his work can be looked back upon as a whole , with proper understand - ing of its environment and with full knowledge of its circumstances , the common reproach of insanity made against each new manifestation of his mind will then be scorned as an exploded prejudice . ''

		All the stories of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's alleged insan - ity are based on nothing more substantial than the attacks of brain fever which at times threat - ened his life .

		Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	, who appears to have been at his side upon at least one of these occasions , writes very beautifully of this delicate subject : '' All that I now remember of many a weary night and day is the vision of a great soul in torment , and through purgatorial fires the ineffable tenderness of the real man emerging , with his passionate appeal to jus - tice and baffled desire for truth .

		To those who could not follow the wanderings of the wearied brain it was nothing but a horrible or grotesque nightmare .

		Some , in those trials , learned , as they could not otherwise have learned , to know him , and to love him as never before . ''

		Many of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's readers recur more frequently to '' Fors '' than to any of his other writings , for they find in that series of dis - jointed outpourings a more candid revelation than elsewhere of the man whom they love and reverence above all other Englishmen now liv - ing ; a form of utterance from which they may almost pluck out the heart of the mystery con - cealed within his complex personality .

		It is interesting to note with what quick sympathy
Carlyle	PERSON	responded to the appeal of '' Fors . ''

		Such a tribute as the following letter , from the man whose spirit Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	always felt most 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, akin to his own , must have been peculiarly gratifying to its recipient : '' This '
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, ' Letter 5th , which I have just finished reading , is incomparable ; a quasi-sacred con - solation to me , which almost brings tears into my eyes !

		Every word of it is as if spoken , not out of my poor heart only , but out of the eternal skies ; words winged with Empyrean wisdom , piercing as lightning , and which I really do not remember to have heard the like of .

		Continue , while you have such utterances in you , to give them voice .

		They will find and force entrance into human hearts , whatever the ' angle of incidence ' may be ; that is to say , whether , for the degraded and inhuman Blockheadism we , so-called ' men , ' have mostly now become , you come in upon them at the broadside , at the top , or even at the bottom .

		Euge , Euge ! ''

		As we all know , '' Fors '' was but the intellec - tual expression of a very practical plan , the '' St.
George	PERSON	's Work . ''

		That in faith without works there can be any saving grace whatever , is a notion that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	has always scorn - fully repudiated .

		At one time , we find him scrubbing the staircase of an Italian inn ; at another , road-mending at Hinksey ; at an - other , keeping clean a
London	LOCATION	street-crossing ; at another , carrying on a model tea-shop ; at still another , teaching in the night schools .

		The '' St.
George	PERSON	's Work '' was an attempt to systematize the energies thus scattered , to en - list the support of others , and thus to accom - plish on a large scale what hitherto he had done upon a small scale by personal effort .

		The inner meaning of the '' St.
George	PERSON	's Work '' is thus well described : `` He aimed at the gradual introduction of higher aims into ordinary life ; at giving true refinement to the lower classes , true simplicity to the upper .

		He pro- posed that idle hands should reclaim waste lands ; that healthy work and country homes should be offered to townsfolk who would ` come out of the gutter . '

		He asked landowners and employers to furnish opportuni - ties for such reforms ; which would involve no elaborate organization nor unelastic rules simply the one thing needful , the refusal of commercialism . ''

		For nearly a quarter-century now the work of the
St. George 's Company	ORGANIZATION	has been carried on by a small but enthusiastic band of earnest re - formers ; it has indeed languished during the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's recent years of illness , but it has not been abandoned , and can make a creditable showing for itself .

		It may yet be destined to illustrate the parable of the grain of mustard seed .

		As was to be expected of a biographer hav - ing such close personal relations with his sub - ject , Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	gives us many familiar glimpses of the Master .

		These begin with the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	lecturer of
1870	DATE	, of whom we are told : '' He used to begin by reading , in his curious intona - tion , the carefully-written passages of rhetoric , which usually occupied only about the half of his hour .

		By and by he would break off , and with quite another air extemporize the liveliest interpolations , describing his diagrams or specimens , restating his arguments , reen - forcing his appeal .

		His voice , till then artificially ca - denced , suddenly became vivacious ; his gestures , at first constrained , became dramatic .

		He used to act his subject , apparently without premeditated art , in the live - liest pantomime ... Lecturing on birds , he strutted like the chough , made himself wings like the swallow ; he was for the moment a cat , in explaining that engrav - ing was the art of scratching .

		If it had been an affec - tation of theatric display , we ' emancipated schoolboys , ' as the Master of the
University	ORGANIZATION	used to call us , would have seen through it at once , and scorned him .

		But it was so evidently the expression of his intense eagerness for his subject , so palpably true to his purpose , and he so carried his hearers with him , that one saw in the grotesque of the performance only the guarantee of an - other and serious side . ''

		The chapter on u The Diversions of
Brant	PERSON	- wood '' is full of these reminiscences .

		For one picture we may find space : '' In the morning you may be waked by a knock at the door , and ' Are you going out ? '

		And pulling up the blind , there is one of our
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	mornings , with the whole range of mountains in one quiet glow above the cool mist of the valley and lake .

		Going down at length on a voyage of exploration , and turning in per - haps at the first door , you intrude upon the Professor at work in his study , half sitting , half kneeling at his round table in the bay window , with the early cup of coffee , and the cat in his crimson arm-chair .

		There he has been working since dawn , perhaps , or on dark morn - ings by candle light . ''

		The story of the illiterate mason is so charac - teristic that we must quote it : '' Once , when new buildings were going on , the ma - son wanted an advance of money , which Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	gave him , and then held out the paper for him to sign the receipt .

		A great deal of hesitation and embarrass - ment ensued , somewhat to Mr.
Ruskiu	PERSON	's surprise , as he knows a north-countryman a great deal too well to ex - pect embarrassment from him .

		At last the man said , in dialect : ` Ah mun put ma marjc . '

		He could not write .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	rose at once , stretched out both hands to the astonished rustic , with the words : ' I am proud to know you .

		Now I understand why you are such an entirely good workman . ' ''

		In
1889	DATE	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was visited with severe illness , which kept him in close confinement for a year .

		Since then , he has been gradually but steadily improving in health , and the biog - rapher 's latest report is in cheerful strain : '' Nowadays , he seems , in all but the power of resum - ing work , himself again , though aged and feeble .

		He comes downstairs late , walks out morning and evening by the lake shore , not so often now climbing up the moor , or boating on the lake .

		He reads the newspapers and books , and spends the evening in the old way in the drawing-room , rarely without music and chess .

		He visits his neighbors , and is glad to see intimate friends and young people ; but he has hardly strength for the distinguished stranger , or the admirer from a distance .

		Remembering all he has passed through , his friends
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 should not be surprised if he shrinks from visits of curiosity and inspection , however kindly meant .

		He retains a vivid memory and interest in many things ; and , when the company is genial and the subject rouses him , talks as brightly as of old .

		There are not wanting signs of reserve power which encourage the hope that many years are in store for him of rest after toil , and tranquil light at evening time . ''

		With a picture thus fair and peaceful linger - ing before the vision , we close this record of a noble life , fervently echoing the prayer that no new storm-cloud may appear to mar the beauty of its setting .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .


Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's new volume zy ? ''

		The trend of Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's sheaf of essays in contemporary crit - icism is sufficiently indicated in their collective title , '' Questions at Issue '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Contemporary wrangling over floating literary is - sues , the mere attack and rejoinder of heated dis - putants , is apt to bewilder rather than satisfy .

		It is from the critic who is a non-combatant , who gets above the sphere in which the controversy is con - ducted , and who -LRB- on the excellent critical principle of '' reculer pour mieux sauter '' -RRB- starts afresh from the common point of departure of the contestants , that we are to look for light .

		In the present vol - ume Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has maintained pretty constantly the critical attitude indicated ; hence the reader may expect to gain from him a clear idea of the general nature of the issues treated , and perhaps a glimmering notion as to their final solution .

		The papers are , of course , gracefully written , combining seriousness of aim with the conversational tone and '' the absence of all pedagogic assertion '' -LRB- the au - thor 's phrase -RRB- which are indispensable in the treat - ment of current themes .

		There are twelve essays in all '' The Tyranny of the Novel , '' '' Has America Produced a Poet ? '' ''

		What Is a Great Poet ? ''

		`` Is Verse in Danger ? '' ''

		Tennyson And After , '' '' The Limits of Realism in Fiction , '' etc. .

		The reader , by-the-bye , need not take alarm at the flavor of chopped hay possibly lingering about the last title .

		From Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's rather ironical little paper on '' Making a Name in Literature '' we may cite ithe following comments on Mr.
E. P. Roe	PERSON	'' a na - tive author called Roe , '' as Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	icily phrased it : '' There are certain books which are not wel - comed by the reviews , and which fail to please or even to meet the eye of experts in literature , which nevertheless , by some strange and unaccountable attraction , become known to the outer public , and are eagerly accepted by a very large circle of read - ers .

		I am not aware that the late Mr.
Roe	PERSON	was < ever a favorite with the writing or speaking critics of
America	LOCATION	.

		He achieved his extraordinary suc - cess not by the aid , but in spite of the neglect and disapproval , of the lettered classes .

		I have no close acquaintance with Mr.
Roe	PERSON	's novels , but I know them well enough to despair of discovering why they were found to be so eminently welcome to thousands of readers ... It is their lack of sa - lient character that makes me wonder what enabled them to float where scores and scores of works not appreciably worse or better than they have sunk . ''

		The key to the problem which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	'' despairs of '' is a sufficiently simple one ; and he may find it concisely , if somewhat too harshly , stated in
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		We gladly bespeak the favor of our j. readers for Mrs -
Schuyler	PERSON	Van Rens - selaer 's little treatise '' Art Out of Doors '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is essentially a plea for good taste in gardening , full of practical hints and sound conclusions , and soberly and persua - sively written .

		.

		In
America	LOCATION	, as the author points out , the truth of the Baconian maxim that `` men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely '' is often unpleasantly manifest .

		The fact that garden - ing , like architecture , is an art , with a definite group of principles and precedents , has scarcely yet dawned upon us ; and hence our parks and cemeteries , the grounds about our country-seats , and our lesser lawns and garden-patches , display solecisms to a degree that would not be tolerated in our buildings . ''

		A glance , '' says the author , '' at any American town or
summer	DATE	colony of villas shows how defi - cient we are when we deal with natural objects . ''

		Having demonstrated the fault , with sound logic and abundant citation of examples , Mrs.
Van Rens	PERSON	- selaer turns to the remedy .

		She discusses in detail the treatment of grounds , roads , and paths , and the disposal of pattern-beds , trees , shrubs , piazzas , etc. , with intelligent enthusiasm , and with a commend - able loyalty to the principle that the study of '' Na - ture unadorned '' lies at the root of sound art .

		A handsome tribute is paid incidentally to Mr.
Olm	PERSON	- sted , '' the most remarkable artist yet born in Amer - ica , '' whose taste has created , in the World 's Fair site and ensemble , such an impressive object-lesson in the scope and possibilities of landscape garden - ing .

		A pungent chapter -LRB- which might have been profitably extended -RRB- is devoted to '' Out - Door Mon - uments . ''

		Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	decides that '' the proportion of bad monuments to good ones in any American city to-day is probably at least ten to one '' ; and we may add that the proportion is not likely to improve until members of committees hav - ing charge of such matters are chosen on some more pertinent principle of selection than their general social or commercial prominence .

		Several notably bad monuments are cited the '' ridiculous figure '' of
Burns	PERSON	and the commonplace one of Seward in
Central Park	LOCATION	; the badly - placed
Gettysburg	LOCATION	statue ; the ugly urns , `` suggestive only of the forty thieves , '' in
Druid Park	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, etc. .

		We were rather surprised at the omission from this list ` of the strange nondescript -LRB- labelled ``
Columbus	LOCATION	'' -RRB- that claws the '' ambient air , '' so to speak , on the
Chicago	LOCATION	Lake 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Front .

		This statue , however , is of recent date , and perhaps Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	has not yet seen it .

		A useful feature of this capital manual is the
Appen	PERSON	- dix containing a list of selected books and essays on gardening .

		Clout * Myths '' The ClaS8ic M y ths in En S
Hsh	ORGANIZATION	Lit ' in English erature '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , by Prof.
Charles Mills Gayley	PERSON	, is a work for which teachers of literature in our colleges and secondary schools should be very grateful .

		Neglect of the clas - sical languages is fast making a sealed book , for the majority of our students , of many of the best passages of English literature .

		Professor
Gayley	PERSON	does not believe that the study of classical myth , otherwise than in the forms of speech that first give it shape , can ever be entirely satisfactory ; but he does be - lieve that something may be done to improve a situation that is fast becoming intolerable .

		Some - thing , at least , of the spirit of classical literature may be imparted by an intelligent and sympathetic English presentation of its substance . ''

		Such sec - ond-hand study must , '' he admits , '' be ever a make - shift , for the literature of a people inheres in its language . '' ''

		But in dealing with the purely imag - inative products of antiquity , the difficulty of the translation may be moderated if those products be reproduced , so far as possible , not in the prosaic but in the poetic atmosphere , and in the imaginative garb of modern art . ''

		As the author puts it in an - other passage : '' If our American pupils and many of their teachers can not quaff Massic and
Faler	PERSON	- nian , they do well to scent the bouquet . ''

		Professor
Gayley	PERSON	's book , better than any other with which we are acquainted , will enable them to '' scent the bouquet '' ; it is based primarily upon Bulfinch , but the matter is so enlarged and rewritten as to make a new and original work .

		It presents the classical myths in attractive description , and illustrates them by numerous passages of the best English poetry .

		It also gives references to many others too long for inclusion .

		The range of these illustrations is wide , and comes down to very recent work .

		We have tested the matter with a number of poems rather out of the way of most readers , and in every case have found them mentioned if not actually quoted by the author .

		We are glad that the quotations are so numerous , as , for younger students , they pro- vide the best sort of material for memoriter work .

		And we must reproduce the excellent doctrine of the writer upon this very point .

		He says : '' With all our study of children and our gabble about methods of teaching them , while we insist , properly enough , that youth is the seed-time of observation , we seem to have forgotten that it is also the har - vest time of memory .

		It is easy for children to re - member what they learn , it is a delight for them to commit to memory ; we act criminally when we send them forth with hardly a fact , or a date , or a glorious verse , in the memory of one out of ten of them . ''

		The book has apparatus of all sorts a full commentary , genealogical tables , rules for pro- nunciation , maps , illustrations , and careful indexes .

Freeman	PERSON	' * The late Professor
Freeman	PERSON	's '' His - Federai Gov emmeni tory of Federal Government '' \ vas r as all historical students know , aban - doned at the close of the first volume , published in
1863	DATE	.

		For many years following , the subject of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	absorbed the author 's atten - tion , and the completion of his great study of that subject left him with other interests more pressing than those connected with the unfinished earlier work .

		So the '' History of Federal Government '' re - mained a fragment and has for many years been out of print .

		Mr.
J. B. Bury	PERSON	, of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dub	ORGANIZATION	- j lin , has now presented us with a new edition of this work , which , in spite of its unfinished condition , is of the first importance to the student of political institutions .


Freeman	PERSON	's original plan is sufficiently stated in his own introductory chapter , or even in the continuation of his title , which ran '' from the foundation of the
Achaian League	ORGANIZATION	to the disruption of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		For this part of the title he has been often , and we think unfairly , censured .

		That the
United States	LOCATION	were disrupted in
1863	DATE	is a historical fact ; that they were to become reunited
two years later	DATE	was by no means clearly to be fore - seen , and famous historians have made far greater errors of judgment than that of
Freeman	PERSON	when he expressed a belief in the permanence of the disrup - tion .

		The plan of his work contemplated a survey of federal institutions as chiefly illustrated by the four significant examples of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and our own country .

		It will ever be a matter of regret that the work should have stopped short at the treatment of the Greek federations .

		The present edition contains , in addition to the text of the first , a chapter on '' the defective forms of fed - eralism which have appeared in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and so the work has been given the new title , '' History of
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral Government in
Greece	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- .

		It contains also a fragment on the German Confederacy , an editorial preface , a full analysis of contents , a careful index , and a twenty-page appen - dix of additional notes by the editor .

		That it is one of the most readable and suggestive of all mod - ern works upon political history goes without saying .

		A Technological anish-E ictionary .

		Spanish-English Diet ' The ''
Diccionario Tecnoldgico Ingle	PERSON	's Espanol '' of Senor Nestor Ponce de - Leon -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	: Ponce de Leon -RRB- , , published in
1883	DATE	, now appears in a second edition , and is accompanied by an entirely new '' Spanish - English '' volume , thus making the work complete .

		It includes within its scope '' words and terms em - ployed in the applied sciences , industrial arts , fine arts , mechanics , machinery , mines , metallurgy , agri - culture , commerce , navigation , manufactures , archi - tecture , civil and military engineering , marine , mil - itary art , railroads , telegraphs , etc. , etc. '' In pre - paring this work the author took
Tollhausen 's Tech	ORGANIZATION	- nological Dictionary as a basis , adding to the terms included in that work all the technical expressions given in thirty-three other dictionaries , general and special , as well as other terms taken from cata -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 logues and similar publications .

		The dictionary is one of equivalents merely , not of definitions .

		The importance of this work , with its sixteen hun - dred double-columned pages , is evident .

		Our com - mercial relations with the Spanish countries of
America	LOCATION	are every year growing in importance , and technical terms are constantly employed in invoices and commercial correspondence .

		The general dic - tionaries offered no assistance in such matters , and many a correspondence is carried on at cross pur - poses for lack of just such precise information as Seilor de Leon 's exhaustive work provides .

		It must speedily find its way to every business office in which Spanish letters are received and answered .

		Wide apart as are the theories of An excellent book r .

		, on the Formation the Constitution expressed in the two volumes , Professor
Hart	PERSON	's
Forma	LOCATION	- tion of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, 1750-1829 '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- makes a , worthy companion to Professor
Wilson	PERSON	's ''
Divis	PERSON	- ion and Secession , '' already reviewed in these col - umns .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	's is the better theory , yet it is saying much to accord to his book the same praise lately given to its sequel .

		He has already estab - lished a reputation as a clear-headed and vigorous writer , and his new volume bears out this conception of him .

		The opening chapter , on the Americans in
1750	DATE	, is an admirable description , to be com - pared with the later section on '' The People of the
United States	LOCATION	in
1789	DATE	. ''

		The writer has purposely avoided making a military history of a period largely characterized by prolonged wars , and he deserves thanks for dwelling the rather on the polit - ical features of the period chronicled .

		The unity of the somewhat scattering Colonial era is kept in view by continual reference to European ambitions , and the cause of the final revolt is truly found , not in the extent but in the nature of Colonial grievances .

		The section on the '' Sources of the Constitution '' preserves an admirable balance between radical views , and finds in the Colonial past the larger sources of the newer construction rather than in the British Constitution on the one hand or the invent - ive brains of
1787	DATE	on the other .

		An account of FroebeVs life and work . ''

		Froebel and Education by Self Ac - tivity '' is the title of an excellent lit - tle volume by Mr.
H. Courthope Bowen	PERSON	in the series of '' Great Educators '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Bowen	PERSON	is well qualified for writing such a compendious account of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's work and thought , by a lifelong interest in the subject , by much study of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's principles and methods both in books and in the kindergarten , and by hav - ing frequent occasion to lecture on
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	at Lon - don ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and elsewhere .

		Two chapters of the little book are devoted to
Froebel	PERSON	's life , and the remaining seven to his ideas as expressed in his writings , conversations , and schools .

		Appendix A gives a complete list of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and Ap - pendix B a classified and annotated list of books on
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	recommended by Mr.
Bowen	PERSON	to students .

		The volume is likewise provided with an index .

		No teacher ought to be without some account of the life and works of the great educational reformer , and this book commends itself as affording both a brief introduction to the whole subject and the in - formation needed in case one wishes to make more exhaustive studies .

		Essays and '' Let Him First Be a Man , and Other papers of inter - Essays '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title given by Mr.
W. H. Venable	PERSON	, the veteran educational speaker and writer , to a mis - cellaneous collection of talks and papers prepared for teachers ' journals and institutes .

		Here are es - says on '' Schoolmastery , '' on '' Books and Reading , '' on '' The History of Education , '' on '' The Utility of the Ideal , '' on ''
Sylvan Poetry	ORGANIZATION	, Mythology , and Sentiment , '' and a '' Memorial Address on Wil - liam
Downs Henkel	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These papers are packed with prose and poetical citations and allusions , and couched in the pithy and sparkling style so much prized by teachers ' associations .

		They are full of sensible and interesting observations adapted to en - courage and inspire the young to higher ideals of culture .

		The book has all the variety of a news - paper , while its style and tendency are far more im - proving .

		`` Camp-fires of a Naturalist '' -LRB- Ap - Narrativeof * .

		V , a
North Ameri	LOCATION	- pleton -RRB- is the graphic story ot Pro- fessor
Lewis Lindsay Dyche	PERSON	's four - teen expeditions after North American mammals - compiled by
Clarence E. Edwords	PERSON	from the Pro , fessor 's field-notes and diary .

		The book deals solely with facts , nothing having been added , as the author tells us , to make the story '' more inter - esting or exciting . ''

		Mr.
Edwords	PERSON	's style , in point of adaptation to matter , could scarcely be bettered .

		The book has the right ring of the off-hand camp - fire '' yarn '' ; and its obvious truth lends to it an interest lacking in more lurid narratives .

		The brief sketch , in the opening chapter , of Professor
Dyche	PERSON	's early career is sufficiently impressive , and offers a useful and not too obtrusive moral to younger read - ers , to whom we especially commend the book .

		There are a number of illustrations of varying merit .

		Mr.
William Henry Bishop	PERSON	's `` A House-Hunter in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a cheery , chatty volume , pleasantly written , and full of practical information withal .

		Sensible American tourists who wish , while abroad , to avoid cosmopolitan hotels , and to really rub elbows with the people of the countries they visit , may find here an array of useful facts as to
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean house rentals , servants ' wages , food expenses , plans of apartments , etc. .

		The burden of Mr.
Bish	PERSON	- op 's book is not , however , house-hunting ; he has really given us a capital travel-book or , rather , an account of the five years ' sojourn of an Amer - ican literary man in some of the most attractive parts of
Europe	LOCATION	.

Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's earliest novel , interesting chiefly because it foreshadows the crowning masterpiece of her almost unparalleled genius , has been added to the exquisite new edition of the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters , published by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mac - millun -RRB- .

		Another volume of this edition includes the poems of the three sisters , as well as the `` Cottage Poems '' -LRB- 1811 -RRB- of their father , the Rev.

		Finally , '' Wuthering Heights '' and ''
Agnes Grey	PERSON	'' fill two other volumes of this edition .

		MR.

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has reached , as it well deserved , a new edition , and in its present crown octavo form , at a reduced price , makes one of the most attract - ive of simple gift-books .

		The illustrations by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	and Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	, which adorn a large proportion of the pages , are everywhere and always a delight .

		The style of this new edition is similar to that in which the same publishers have given us ''
Cran	PERSON	- ford '' and '' The Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		LOWELL 'S '' Conversations on Some of the Old Poets '' was published in
1845	DATE	, and has been out of print for many years .

		The author did not think it worth re - printing , but a

Lowell	LOCATION	's works .

		Mr.
Robert Ellis Thompson	PERSON	, who writes an introduction for the edition , tells us how he got hold of the book in his college days , and '' shared in that glow Mr.
Stead	PERSON	- man -LSB- sic -RSB- speaks of as felt by students of a still earlier time . ''

		Many readers will be glad to have the book thus made accessible , although it only represents the author 's immaturity , the period when he was fledging his critical wings .

		`` A PRACTICAL Course in English Composition '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- by Prof.
Alphonso G. Newcomer	PERSON	, is a useful text - book upon a somewhat original plan .

		It is neither a rhetoric nor a grammar , but aims instead '' to show the student how simple a thing it is to find material '' for essays , and '' how easy and delightful it is to work that material into good , interesting compositions . ''

		It gives practical directions for the narrative , descriptive , per - suasive , and argumentative forms of composition , as well as for some of the styles of newspaper writing .

		Miss
Mary F. Hyde	PERSON	's '' Advanced Lessons in English '' -LRB-
Heath	LOCATION	-RRB- is a little book upon the same general subject , but strictly grammatical in its treatment .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Sept. 26 , 1893	DATE	.

		It is now almost a year since the writer of these notes , observing the ruinous discounts and extremely long credits given in certain sections of the publishing trade , was led to predict the succession of failures among weaker houses which has since taken place .

		This prophecy accidentally got into print , and as far as it was noticed at all it was made light of at the time .

		It is easy to see now , however , that the pub - lishing business was passing through the same condi - tions of inflation from which all trades have experienced so serious a reaction .

		Loss of confidence precipitated a crisis , but the time was no doubt ripe for a change .

		Less than two months ago a number of the largest publishing houses in the country were seriously consid - ering the advisability of throwing over a goodly pro- portion of their Fall books into the next year .

		Perhaps , this has been done to some extent , but a glance at the season 's announcements indicates a determination to carry out arrangements already made .

		I am informed by more than one leading
New York	LOCATION	firm of publishers that their orders are larger than were expected , and that in
Chicago	LOCATION	and vicinity especially , the business is almost normal .

		If a halt has been called to the reckless competition in discounts and credits , the panic will not have been without its benefit .

		Resident literary men have scarcely begun to return to town from their
summer	DATE	outings such of them as were able to take outings this year .

		Not all of them are as fortunate as Mr.
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	, whose out - ing lasts the year round .

		He has a country home at Convent ,
N. J.	PERSON	, and is rarely seen in the city .

		His place is called '' The
Holt	PERSON	, '' and there he raises flowers , fruits , and vegetables , for his own and his friends ' use .

		No announcement of his literary plans is obtainable beyond the volume of short stories already mentioned in THE DIAL , soon to be published by Messrs.
Charles	PERSON	.

		Scribner 's Sons .

		Some interesting announcements are made for the literary celebration of the centenary of the death of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	the famous leader of the Girondists , in the French Revolution , whose execution by the guil - lotine -LRB-
Nov. 8 , 1793	DATE	-RRB- , at the hands of extremists of her own party , was the occasion of the memorable excla - mation , `` O Liberty !

		what crimes are committed in thy name ! ''

		The '' Life and Letters '' of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	will soon be published ; and an early number of `` Scrib - ner 's Magazine '' will give an article on the same sub - ject by the same biographer , who has had free access to the family papers .

		A selection from the letters will appear in the magazine .

		The announcement of an acting version of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's '' Mercedes , '' by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has called special attention to the fact that that play has been put on the season 's repertory of Mr.
A. M. Palmer	PERSON	's stock company .

		Miss
Julia Arthur	PERSON	's ap - pearance as '' Mercedes '' at the production of the drama in this city last
Spring	DATE	added considerably to her pres - tige as an actress .

		The company began a tour of the country , at
Brooklyn	LOCATION
last week	DATE	; and it was well worth a pilgrimage to the sister city to see once more the almost perfect rendering of the little play .

		The latter requires the simplest yet the most finished acting .

		The performance will be given some two or three times during the company 's stay in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The exhibition of English Pre-Raphaelite paintings , , given at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION
last Winter	DATE	, is recalled by the numerous volumes concerning the move - ment , and the reprints of books by members of the group , about to be published .

		The most important of these is the new work by
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, which is looked for with the deepest interest by old disciples of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , and by novitiates created last year .

		Next in interest is the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	reprint of
Christina G. Rossetti	PERSON	's `` Goblin Market and Other Poems , '' to be illustrated by
Lawrence Housman	PERSON	.

		Put - nam also will reprint
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' House of Life '' in their '' Literary Gems '' series .

		The literary and artistic activity of Dr.
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	and his daughters is emphasized by a new
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 volume in which all three are concerned , shortly to be published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	`` The Story of
Washington	LOCATION	'' is written by
Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye	PERSON	, edited by
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	, and contains about a hundred illustrations by Miss
Allegra Eggleston	PERSON	.

		It is expected that the book will supply a demand for a life of
Washington	LOCATION	the man , of convenient size , not only popular but also including the latest results of research .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth Cavazza	PERSON	, whose sketches of Italian life have attracted wide attention , will soon begin in the '' Atlantic Monthly '' a three-part story entitled '' The Man from Aidone , '' a study of Sicilian life among the peasants and in the sulphur mines .

		Love and tragedy fill the pages of what is probably Mrs.
Cavaz	PERSON	- za 's most important contribution to fiction .

		Her real - istic stories are the more remarkable from the fact that the author is American by birth , and has never visited
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Having married an Italian gentleman , she will make her first trip to that country this
Winter	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Cavazza	PERSON	has always been a resident of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Me.	LOCATION	, and has had a close friendship with the Lonfellow and
Whittier	LOCATION	families , from whom she received helpful advice in her early literary work .

		Mr.
Arthur Sherburue Hardy	PERSON	has settled into his editorial duties at '' The Cosmopolitan '' office so quietly that people scarcely realize that he is now a permanent factor in
New York	LOCATION	literary life .

		As for the magazine itself , I learn that it was necessary to stop printing the
September	DATE	number , containing the World 's Fair articles and illustrations , in order to get the
October	DATE	number published .

		Orders for some forty thousand copies have been left unfilled .

		The illustrations of the World 's Fair in the magazines , it may be said , have been as a whole very artistic and suggestive , but I have seen nothing that could compare with the series of heliotype views given in recent numbers of the `` American Archi - tect . ''

		The original photographs evidently have been taken after the grounds were put in perfect shape , and they give one who has not seen the Exposition a realiz - ing sense of its beauty which has not been obtained elsewhere .

		It is to be hoped that the decorative work at the Fair by our American artists may be reproduced in the same fashion .

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Professor Huxley 's '' Collected Works '' are to be pub - lished by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the '' Eversley '' style of their
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and
Morley	PERSON	.

		It is said that Mr.
P. G. Hamerton	PERSON	has written his autobiography , and deposited it in his publisher 's safe , there to remain until after the author 's death .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's Christmas book for this year will be called '' The True Story Book , '' and its contents will range from
Thermopylae	LOCATION	and the finding of Vinland to events of our own century .

		Dr.
Jessopp	PERSON	and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	are at work upon a life of
Donne	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Jessopp	PERSON	wrote the article on
Donne	PERSON	in the '' Dictionary of National Biography , '' and possesses , moreover , a number of his unpublished manuscripts . ''

		My Arctic Journal , '' by Mrs.
Lieutenant Peary	PERSON	, is announced for early publication by the
Contemporary Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be illustrated by the remarkable photographs taken by Mr. and Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	in
Northern Greenland	LOCATION	.

		We learn from the
London	LOCATION	`` Bookman '' that
M. Bourget	PERSON	's visit to this country is the result of an arrangement with the editor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Her - ald , '' and is to result in an American society novel , to be published in that newspaper .

		`` The National Observer , '' in consequence of the scarcity of new publications during the dull
Summer	DATE	season , filled one of its recent numbers with reviews of old books , such as `` Ivanhoe , '' `` In Memoriam , '' and
Macaulay	PERSON	's '' History , '' done in the modern style .

		An English publisher announces a translation of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's `` Brand , '' by Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	.

		We have often questioned the possibility of translating '' Brand '' into English verse at all adequate to the form and thought of that poem , but if Mr.
Herford	PERSON	's work shall prove to have been done throughout upon the plane of the fragment published in '' The Contemporary Review '' a year or two since , he will deserve the heart - iest of congratulations .

		Mr.
Norman Gale	PERSON	, in the
London	LOCATION	`` Academy , '' makes the following suggestive comparison between the minor poets of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	: `` Are the writers of American minor verse , taken in the lump , better than their English relations , or do the oversea publishers behave more warily than those in
London	LOCATION	?

		Probably in the midst of a practical , mechanical people the muse of song finds fewer open houses .

		One thing is certain : the volumes of verse that are visitors to our shores strike a better average than do the abundant books of rhyme that , coming from our own presses , exceed the hairs of the head in multitude . ''

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Literary World '' is the source of the following bit of information : `` The great edition of
Plato 's Republic	ORGANIZATION	, to which , as is well known , Professors
Jowett	PERSON	and
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	have been devoting them - selves for some years , will see the light very shortly .

		It was an open secret in
Balliol	LOCATION	at the time of the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's severe illness eighteen months ago , that one of the chief anxieties of his physicians arose from the patient 's absolute determination to get up and work sometimes for several hours at
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		or proofs .

		And Professor
Campbell	PERSON	, too , has found an active man 's consolation for retirement in the magnum opus . ''

		The French courts have recently decided that agree - ments between author and publisher are strictly per - sonal , the ground of the judgment being that the author chooses his publisher , for his own personal reasons , as a quasi-collaborator ; whereas the reputation and acts of any substituted publisher might be morally and materially damaging to the book and its success .

		The point was also laid down that it would be unfair to subject any author and his works to the transfers to which the busi - ness of a publisher is exposed .

		The case arose from the publication , by the successors to the business of
Dentu	LOCATION	, of a new edition of the '' lambes '' of
Auguste Barbier	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Roden Noel	PERSON	was with
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	at the time of the latter 's death , and , in '' The Gentle - man 's Magazine , '' thus writes of his interment : `` An - gelo and I helped to put him in his coffin , and drove with him across
Rome	LOCATION	in the night at 3.30 .

		It was quite dark , but as we came near the Protestant Cemetery the dawn began to glimmer above the buildings of the
Palatine	LOCATION	and through the arches of the
Colosseum	LOCATION	; a rare bird woke and twittered in the cypress trees ; long wreaths of white mist wavered close to the ground .

		... He lies one pace away from
Trelawney	LOCATION	, and within reach of a kiss from
Shelley	PERSON	's cor cordium , a most lovely 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, spot in that most lovely cemetery .

		The birds sang inces - santly all through the funeral . ''

		An eight-volume series of '' Periods of European History '' is in preparation by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The works will embody the results of the latest investi - gations , and will contain references and notes .

		The volume treating of the
Seventh Period	ORGANIZATION	, A. D.
1789	DATE	-
1815	DATE	, by Mr.
H. Morse Stevens	PERSON	, has been issued , and that on the
First Period	ORGANIZATION	, A. D. 476-918 , by Mr.
C. W. C. Oman	PERSON	, is nearly ready .

		The second Period ,
A. D. 918	PERSON	-
1272	DATE	, is by Mr.
T. F. Tout	PERSON	; the third ,
A. D. 1272-1494	PERSON	, by Mr.
R. Lodge	PERSON	; the period
A. D. 1494-1598	PERSON	, by Mr.
A. H. Johnson	PERSON	; from
A. D. 1598-1715	PERSON	, by Mr.
H. O. Wakemau	PERSON	; from
A. D. 1715-1789	PERSON	, by Mr.
A. Hassall	PERSON	; and the eighth and concluding Period embraces the history of
Europe	LOCATION	from
1815	DATE	to
1893	DATE	.

		The general editor is Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	, and his co-laborers are all well known for their studies in the departments they have chosen .

		Lady
Shelley	PERSON	, says the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum , '' has given to the Bodleian Library , on conditions , an exten - sive collection of
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		relating to the late
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	and his wife
Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley	PERSON	, consisting of letters written by them or ad - dressed to them , as well as original
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's poems , and the original Diary kept by Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	, together with a number of copies of the impression of the same privately printed by the late Sir
Percy Shelley	PERSON	.

		The principal conditions which Lady Shelley desires to be strictly observed are : that all these documents , ex - cept
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		of poems and such letters as have already been printed by Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	in her edition of her hus - band 's prose works or in Prof.
Dowden	PERSON	's Life , should until the centenary of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's death in
1922	DATE	be kept apart , and not be allowed to be seen by any person ex - cept the Curators and
Bodley	PERSON	's Librarian , and that no copy of any portion of them should be taken by any one .

		WHITTIER 'S LOVE OF HOME .


Whittier	LOCATION	, as is well known , was no traveller .

		It is doubtful if he was ever outside of
New England	LOCATION	.

		His home attachment was a passion , and he had little wish to roam .

		Mrs.
Mary B. Claflin	PERSON	, in her '' Personal Rec - ollections of
Whittier	LOCATION	, '' lately published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, gives an interesting passage on this phase of the poet 's character : `` He was sensitive to every change of temperature and seemed to be constantly longing for the
summer	DATE	air , the blooming flowers , and the singing birds .

		He suffered in the cold , bleak winds of
New England	LOCATION	, and often said : ' It must be confessed we have a hard climate .

		I always wish the Pilgrims had drifted down to
Virginia	LOCATION	. '

		But his love for
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Essex County	LOCATION	wasfereater than his dis - like of the long winters and the rough gales .

		The sunniest climes and the richest landscapes could not win him from his loyalty to his home , for he found every charm of beauty and grandeur in its rugged scenes .

		The Merrimac was more to him than the
Rhine	LOCATION	, and
Chocorua	LOCATION	and
Mount Washington	LOCATION	more than the splendors of the
Jungfrau	LOCATION	and the Matter - horn .

		Not the Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	nor the
Bosphorus	LOCATION	could rival in his affections the North Shore and the expanse of foam-crested waters about the
Isles of Shoals	ORGANIZATION	.

		A friend whom he greatly admired , in answering some inquiries of his as to her birthplace in another State , added : ' But my ancestors lived in
Manchester-by-the-Sea	LOCATION	. ' '

		Oh , ' he exclaimed , ' I knew thee was from
Essex County	LOCATION	. ' ''

		ORGANIZATION AMONG LITERARY WORKERS .

		Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, in some appreciative comments on the
Literary Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION
last July	DATE	, printed in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' for
October	DATE	, gives the following sensible observations on the benefits that might be derived from organization among literary workers : ' ' Perhaps the time is not yet ripe for an effective literary Con - gress .

		But the time is evidently at hand for general confer - ences of the literary men and women who use the English language .

		Literature pure and simple is not organized , and the workers in it are without standards , and without the ben - efits of conference and cooperation .

		Philology , folk-lore , Old English , etc. , have their societies of mutual comparison and aid ; there are even historical associations upon a scientific basis .

		Literature is unorganized .

		It is probably incapable of scientific organization and cooperation from its nature .

		But the great body of writers of English literature can certainly gain power and encouragement by conferences if not by for - mal organization ... '' The value of the
Chicago	LOCATION	conference is in the suggestion of the possibility of impressing literary workers with their increasing responsibility in their increasing opportunity , and of elevating the literary standard of the English-reading world .

		If five hundred of the producing authors of
America	LOCATION	had come together at
Chicago	LOCATION	and conferred seriously upon this subject would they not have gained strength and clarity of purpose , and would not the effect have been felt through - out the country ?

		Would not personal contact and compar - ison of views have resulted in some sort of inspiration ?

		Would not such a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, even if confined to fiction and belles-lettres , raise the profession in dignity , and profoundly impress the English-reading world ?

		Why , in respect to such conferences , should literature be an exception to all the sci - ences , and to technical literary scholarship ? ''

		ACCORDING TO STANDPOINT .

		Two well-dressed Americans were overheard narrat - ing to each other their experiences as visitors to Chi - cago . ''

		The greatest thing I have seen here , '' said one , '' is the Stock Yards .

		I was down there yesterday watch - ing them killing hogs .

		They would yank a hog by the heels , stick him , tumble him into hot water , and scrape him , all inside of a minute .

		I 'm sure some of 'em were alive yet when their bristles were taken off . ''

		The other man laughed heartily , as though in admiration both of the efficiency of the process and of the joke on the hogs . ''

		Yes , '' said he , ''
Chicago	LOCATION	is a smart town !

		It beats the world , I reckon ! ''

		A man with foreign dress and accent was heard , at the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, explaining the failure of Christianity in
India	LOCATION	. ''

		The conditions and standards of our country , '' said he , '' are different from those of yours .

		Your
Chicago	LOCATION	slaughter-houses are a shame and a curse to civilization .

		A religion which allows such things can not be understood and is not wanted in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
ST. PETER	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following sonnet , apropos of one of the most cel - ebrated of recent '' finds , '' is from a volume of verse just published in
England	LOCATION	by Mme.
Darmesteter	PERSON	-LRB- A.
Mary F. Robinson	PERSON	-RRB- : '' To-morrow or in twenty centuries The sudden falling open of a lid On some gray tomb beside the Pyramid
May	DATE	bring the first Evangel to our eyes . ''

		That day , who knows with what aghast surprise Our priests shall touch the very deeds He did , And learn the truth so many ages hid , And find , perchance , the Christ did never rise .

		`` What then ?

		shall all our faith be accounted vain ?

		Nothing be left of all our nights of prayer ?

		Nothing of all the scruples , all the tears , Of endless generations ' endless years ?

		Take heart !

		Be sure the fruits of these remain .

		Hark to the Inner Witness : Christ is there ! ''

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 HYMN OF THE HARVEST .

		Now to thee , gracious Lord of the seasons , be honor and glory and praise , That again in the joy of the harvest our jubilant anthem we raise .

		Though many the fears that beset us , though faith waxes feeble and cold , Thy bow , with its promise unbroken , glitters still as it glit - tered of old .

		Though weary we grow in our watching the weeks of the drought as they pass , When the earth is as iron beneath us , and the heaven above us as brass .

		Yet the showers come back in their season ; once more in the land there is seen The brook brimming over with crystal , the grass as the emer - ald green .

		Though troubled the spirit within us , when the mist upon val - ley and plain Lies thick , and the clouds in their armies return again after the rain .

		Yet the sun cometh forth as a giant , and after the tempest the morn Is cloudless and fair , and the color grows golden and rich on the corn .

		For seed time and harvest we thank Thee ; our fears as the shadows have fled ; Thou hast given his seed to the sower , Thou hast given the eater his bread .

		The notion that literary work should not be done for pay , that it should be exempted from the commercial conditions under which man ordinarily does service to his fellows , is one that frequently finds expression -LRB- and some - times most unexpectedly -RRB- among professional men of letters .

		It has more than once proved an obstacle in the path of the
London	LOCATION
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, and has probably been among the causes that have thus far prevented an effect - ive similar organization of the literary workers of our own country .

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	has done yeoman service in combating this idea among Englishmen , but it seems to have some - thing of the hydra 's vitality , and the severance of one head is but the signal for another to rear its crest .

		A recent deliverance upon this subject is to be found in the last issue of ''
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Magazine , '' and is of peculiar interest as expressing the opinion of a writer who is no less shrewd in the management of his business affairs than accomplished as a man of letters .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	-LRB- for he it is to whom we refer -RRB- has a weakness for the paradoxical , and it is not always safe to take him quite as seriously as he reads .

		But his recent discussion of the literary life in its business aspect is prefaced by certain opinions which , allowing for an evi - dently whimsical element in their statement , still seem to embody the doctrine that it is ig - noble to write for pay .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is , indeed , careful to say that , under existing conditions , a writer is bound to take pay for his work ; but he vaguely intimates that existing conditions are all wrong , that there is something essen - tially degrading in a writer 's acceptance of com - pensation for his work , and that in an ideal state of society the man of letters would some - how be taken care of without sharing in the contentions of the market-place .

		We are inclined to think that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has not gone far enough in his analysis of the problem .

		The man of letters is , like other men , whether Jew or
Gentile	PERSON	, '' fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , sub - ject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and
summer	DATE	. ''

		In a word , the man of letters lives , and must have the means of subsistence .

		212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Shall he live by his pen , or shall he find other sources of revenue , and leave to his hours of leisure the cultivation of literature ?

		Many men of letters , doubtless , have done this ; much of the best literature has been produced under these conditions .

		The very best literature will get itself written under the most adverse form of these conditions .

		When , once in the cen - turies , a man has it in him to produce a ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' or a `` Divine Comedy , '' he will fol - low the star that lights his soul to the accom - plishment of its divine purpose .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	thinks that
Milton	PERSON	was overpaid for his '' Par - adise Lost , '' and doubtless he was , in the sense that the bookseller 's paltry stipend did nothing to strengthen the motive that impelled to the composition of the epic .

		But we must remem - ber that literature consists of more than the supreme masterpieces ; that the minor master - pieces are serviceable in their way ; and that the work of the honest journeyman is not with - out its uses .

		That the pursuit of literature should be relegated to the spare hours of men who earn their living otherwise , is a principle hardly to be defended , and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	cer - tainly does not mean to have us take that view .

		The application of such a principle would spare us many worthless books , no doubt ; but it would also deprive us of much work , helpful in its generation , that we could ill do without .

		But if , on the other hand , literature is a le - gitimate profession , an occupation to which it is well that many men should devote their best energies and their entire lives , there seems to be no good reason why it should not fit into the general scheme of society and share in the advantages of its economic organization .

		That organization may at present work in a way very unsatisfactory to the ethical sense , but not even Mr.
Howells	PERSON	will deny it to be better than the barbarism which it has superseded , and to represent a necessary stage in the evolution of the civilized life .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	seems to think that the ideal society of the future will some - how take charge of the literary artist and care for him as for a public benefactor , that it will provide him with maintenance in the Prytau - eum .

		It is here , we think , that the analysis is defective .

		Under anything like the existing social organization , such public maintenance would merely shift the burden of the artist 's support from his own special public to the pub - lic in general .

		He would still be paid for his work , having merely a new paymaster , prob - ably less intelligent than the old one .

		But un - der the socialistic organization that Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells probably has in mind , we can see no reason why the artist should be singled out for special consideration .

		The honest ditch-digger is a public benefactor no less than the honest poet , and , if there be anything ignoble in the accept - ance of pay for honest work , it is equally de - grading to the manhood of both .

		All work , whether it be the digging of ditches or the writ - ing of epics , is service done by man to his fel - low men .

		There are but two things that need concern the worker : let him take heed that the work be worth doing , and that it be ser - viceably performed .

		The real degradation , whether in literature or in any other form of activity , lies either in the doing of work that is essentially worthless , or in the doing of any kind of work for other than its own sake .

		With the literary worker , the greater danger of degradation comes from the second of these causes .

		While we must admit the principle to be legitimate , the frank acceptance of litera - ture as a commercial product , to be bought and paid for at the market rates , does result in attracting to the literary profession a large number of workers who have no higher aim than that of turning the profession of writing to the greatest possible pecuniary account .

		But the moral to be drawn from this state of things is precisely the same as that to be drawn from any other occupation .

		Work for the mere purpose of gain is always ignoble , no matter what sort of work it may be .

		Upon this point , Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	has given us the whole ethical doctrine , has interpreted the law and the prophets , in his lecture on '' Work . '' ''

		It is physically impossible for a well-educated , in - tellectual , or brave man to make money the chief ob - ject of his thoughts ; just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them .

		All healthy people like their dinners , but their dinner is not the main object of their lives .

		So all healthy-minded people like making money ought to like it , and to enjoy the sensation of winning it : but the main object of their life is not money ; it is something better than money .

		A good soldier , for instance , mainly wishes to do his fighting well .

		He is glad of his pay very properly so , and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it still , his main notion of life is to win battles , not to be paid for winning them .

		So of clergymen .

		They like pew-rents , and baptismal fees , of course ; but yet , if they are brave and well-educated , the pew-rent is not the sole object of their lives , and the baptismal fee is not the sole purpose of the baptism ; the clergyman 's object is essentially to baptize and preach , not to be paid for preaching ... And so with all other brave and rightly-trained men ; their work is first , their fee second very important always , but still second .

		But in every nation , as I said , there are a vast class who are ill-educated , cowardly , and more or less stupid .

		And with these people , just as certainly the fee is first , and
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 213 the work second , as with brave people the work is first , and the fee second . ''

		In a word , every man toiling with hand or head has the twofold ethical responsibility of choosing his work well and of doing it well .

		But in the special case of the literary toiler , the essence of doing well is to be sincere , truth - ful , and lofty of aim .

		If his work be done in this spirit , he need feel no shame in accepting , or even in stipulating for , its just reward , whether he be a journalist or a historian , a novelist or a poet .

		And if the time ever comes when all work is done in this spirit , we shall probably discover the existing social organiza - tion , based upon private contract and the ut - most individual freedom , to be the real Utopia of which impatient idealists have been dream - ing throughout the ages .

		BENJAMIN
JO WETT	PERSON	.


Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	,
Master of Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	, Ox - ford , died on the first of this month , at the age of seventy-six .

		Born in
1817	DATE	, he was educated , first at
St. Paul 's School	ORGANIZATION	, then at the
College	ORGANIZATION	with which he has been ever since identified .

		He became a scholar of Balliol in
1835	DATE	, a fellow in
1838	DATE	, and a tutor in
1842	DATE	.

		In
1855	DATE	,
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	appointed him Regius Professor of Greek .

		In
1882	DATE	he was elected Vice-Chancellor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was distinguished both as a theologian and as a Greek scholar .

		In the former capacity he wrote a com - mentary upon certain of the Epistles , and contrib - uted the paper '' On the Interpretation of Scrip - ture '' to the famous volume of '' Essays and Re - views . ''

		It is as a theologian that he figures in Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's clever satire , '' The New Republic , '' thinly disguised under the name of
Jenkinson	PERSON	.

		As a Greek scholar he was one of the foremost of the century .

		His translations of Thucydides , of the `` Politics '' of Aristotle , and of
Plato	LOCATION	, are the best English versions of those authors that we possess , and may fairly be regarded as English classics , by reason of their beautiful and idiomatic style .

		Of his magnum opus , the translation of Plato , Profes - sor
Shorey	PERSON	wrote as follows upon the appearance of the third edition last year : '' It is not given to every man to compose -LRB- in original or in translation -RRB- five volumes of English prose of unfailing pro- priety , lucidity , and charm , never deviating into vulgarity or rhetoric , but always preserving as by Hellenic instinct the just mean and the exquisite urbanity of the best literary society .

		If we except the British Bible , it is probably safe to say that no modern literature possesses any other translation of like extent and literary excellence . ''

		This quotation is taken from a review published by Professor
Shorey	PERSON	in the '' American Journal of Philology '' probably the most competent review , with regard to both philology and philosophy , that
Jowett	PERSON	's work has received .

		We make a further quotation upon the subject of
Jowett	PERSON	's theory of translation : `` All that he says in his preface about slavish conformity to the original being the petty ambition of a schoolboy sounds plausible enough , and might convince us , did not
Munro	PERSON	's Lucretius exist to prove that the most scrupulous conformity to the original and a certain inevitableness in the rendering of each and every word are quite compatible with an English of the purest and noblest type .

		Ingenious , fluent , easy , are the epithets we apply to Professor
Jowett	PERSON	's renderings ; we should never , I think , call them inevitable .

		He himself ad - mits that to reproduce the movement and feeling of the orig - inal is the translator 's ideal .

		But every scholar must feel that he has sacrificed this to the fetich of an equable and con - ventionable English style . ''

		As for
Jowett	PERSON	's own style , unfettered by the re - quirements of translation , no more beautiful exam - ple can be given than the passage in which he '' re - luctantly severs his lifelong communion with the spirit of the greatest teacher who has ever appealed to the reason of man . ''

		To the following lovely end does he bring his account of the life and works of Plato : '' And so , having brought into the world ' noble children , ' he rests from the labors of authorship .

		More than two thou - sand two hundred years have passed away since he returned to the place of Apollo and the Muses .

		Yet the echo of his words continues to be heard among men , because of all phil - osophers he has the most melodious voice .

		He is the inspired prophet or teacher who can never die , the only one in whom the outward form adequately represents the fair soul within ; in whom the thoughts of all who went before him are re - flected and of all who come after him are partly anticipated .

		Other teachers of philosophy are dried up and withered after a few centuries they have become dust ; but he is fresh and blooming , and is always begetting new ideas in the minds of men .

		They are one-sided and abstract ; but he has many sides of wisdom .

		Nor is he always consistent with himself , because he is always moving onward , and knows that there are many more things in philosophy than can be expressed in words , and that truth is greater than consistency .

		He who approaches him in the most reverent spirit shall reap most of the fruit of his wisdom ; he who reads him by the light of ancient commentators will have the least understanding of him . ''

		We may see him with the eye of the mind in the groves of the Academy , or on the banks of the Ilissus , or in the streets of
Athens	LOCATION	, alone or walking with
Socrates	PERSON	, full of those thoughts which have since become the common posses - sion of mankind .

		Or we may compare him to a statue hid away in some temple of Zeus or Apollo , no longer existing on earth , a statue which has a look as of the God himself .

		Or we may once more imagine him following into another state of being the great company of heaven which he beheld of old in a vision .

		So , ' partly trifling , but with a certain degree of seriousness , ' we linger around the memory of a world which has passed away . ''

		This brief memorial of
Jowett	PERSON	would be incomplete without a word concerning the man himself .

		One of the most lovable of mortals , his personal in - fluence was probably as important as that exerted by his writings .

		For many years past the Oxford colleges have known no more commanding presence than his , and upon his associates of the last fifty years he has impressed himself as few great men have ever had the privilege of doing .

		In the En - glish reviews of the coming weeks we may look for many personal tributes to his memory , and from them the world at large will come to learn something of the man whom it has long revered as a scholar .

		214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
MR. GOSSE	PERSON	'S PUZZLE OVER POE .

		Not long since , the readers of a
New York	LOCATION	liter - ary journal were asked by its editors to name the best ten American books .

		The list as finally made out , or selected , by six hundred and thirty-two read - ers , was as follows , with the number of votes given each book :
Emerson	PERSON	's Essays , 512 ;
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Scarlet Letter , '' 493 ;
Longfellow	PERSON	's Poems , 444 ; Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' 434 ; Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's Autocrat , '' 388 ; Irving 's Sketch - Book , '' 307 ;
Lowell	PERSON	's Poems , 269 ;
Whittier	LOCATION	's Po - ems ; 256 ;
Wallace	PERSON	's ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' 250 ;
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's Rise of the Dutch Republic , '' 246 .

		It will be seen that this list does not include the name of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Edmund W. Gosse	PERSON	, the British poet and critic , thinks the omission '' extraordinary and sinister , '' and says that if he were an American he would be inclined to call it disastrous .

		It makes him wonder what is the standard of American style .

		Poe he regards as our most perfect , most original , most exquisite poet ; while some of the writers in - cluded in the list he had apparently never heard of .

		The omission of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's name was certainly signif - icant and does undoubtedly indicate that the taste of our people demands in an author or a poet some - thing more than mere literary genius ; and it is probably true that the world of readers generally cares less and less for poets of the Poe , the Swin - burne , the
Rossetti	PERSON	type .

		Emerson did not admit
Poe	PERSON	in his '' Parnassus , '' though he admitted other American poets much less famous .

		Emerson 's taste in this respect was fairly representative of that of his countrymen .

		Poe 's literary genius , as such , was undoubtedly of a high order , higher in some respects than that of
Whittier	LOCATION	or Longfellow or
Lowell	LOCATION	; but he was much less than these men in other important respects .

		He had less heart , less soul , less sympathy , T - in fact , was far less as a man , a human being .

		His work is interesting to poets and critics because of its technical perfection and originality .

		It is not imitative , it shows great mastery in fields where mas - ters are rare .

		But back of his literary and artistic talent what is there ?

		Not a large , brotherly , helpful man surely .

		Hardly any normal , healthful human throb ; hardly one valuable idea .

		Indeed , there is not one crumb of the bread of life in Poe , not one line that a man , as such , need read .

		His poems are liter - ary feats two of them quite extraordinary feats , it is true .

		I mean '' The Bells '' and The Raven . ''

		This , it seems to me , is the best that can be said of them ; while his famous ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' is to many readers like sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal .

		Poe , like
Swinburne	PERSON	, was a verbal poet merely ; empty of thought , empty of sympathy , empty of love for any real thing : a graceful and nimble skater up and down over the deeps and shallows of life , deep or shallow , it was all the same to him .

		Not one real thing did he make more dear to us by his matchless rhyme ; not one throb of the uni - versal heart , not one flash of the universal mind , did he seize and put in endearing form for his fel - low men .

		Our band of
New England	LOCATION	poets have helped enrich and ennoble human life ; the world is fairer , life is sweeter , because they lived and sang ; character , heroism , truth , courage , devotion , count for more since
Emerson	PERSON	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	and Whit - tier and
Lowell	PERSON	were inspired by these themes .

		I am not complaining that
Poe	PERSON	was not didactic : di - dacticism is death to poetry .

		I am complaining that he was not human and manly , and that he did not touch life in any helpful and liberating way .

		His poems do not lay hold of real things .

		I do not find the world a more enjoyable or beautiful place because he lived in it .

		I find myself turning to his poems , not for mental or spiritual food , as I do to
Wordsworth	PERSON	or
Emerson	PERSON	or Whitman , or for chivalrous human sentiments as in
Tennyson	LOCATION	, but to catch a glimpse of the weird , the fantastic , and , as it were , of the night-side or dream-side of things . ''

		You are not wrong who deem That my days have been a dream . ''

		But the man whose days are a dream , no matter with what skill he portrays his dream , will never take deep hold upon men 's hearts .

		Think of the difference , for instance , between
Burns	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	.

		We are drawn to
Burns	PERSON	the man ; he touches our most tender and human side ; his art does not oc - cupy our attention .

		With
Poe	PERSON	it is quite the re - verse : we care nothing for the man , nothing for the matter of his poems ; his art alone seems important , and elicits our admiration .

		The full-blown professional literary critic , like Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, disassociates literature from all human or religious or scientific or personal values what - ever .

		Its purely art value its value as addressed to our sense of form , of proportion , of music , of color , etc. , alone counts .

		But with the mass of readers , as I have said , this view counts less and less .

		With the coming in of science , of democracy , of the industrial age , there has come in a new spirit , which demands of the book or the poem , What is it for ?

		what message has it for struggling , thinking men ?

		which mood and temper begot it ?

		in short , what ethical and human value has it ?

		This spirit is not insensible to the manner of the work , but it finds the final value in the matter , and especially in the man out of which the matter grew .

		Arnold 's say - ing that all good poetry is indirectly a criticism of life , is a wise one .

		But more than two centuries before him , Sir
Thomas Elyot	PERSON	said that poetry was the first philosophy , and that its chief office was to teach men '' how to live well . ''

		A French critic and essayist was recently quoted in this journal as saying that in
France	LOCATION	there is a growing belief that letters '' are not merely a relaxation , an amusement , or a consolation , but that they ought to result in some direct teaching and help to man , tracing for him a line of Conduct in life . ''

		In other words , in estimating a writer 's work , verse as well as prose , its moral and human value is to be taken into ac - count its value as thought , and its value as a stim -

		Art for art 's sake , in our age and country , sounds hollow and mocking .

		Art for life 's sake and for the soul 's sake , is the cry of the coming literature .

		I would not undervalue Poe .

		He was a unique genius .

		But I would account for his failure to deeply impress his own countrymen , outside the professional literary guild .

		His fund of love and sympathy was small .

		He was not broadly related to his fel - lows , as were

		JOHN
BURROUGHS	LOCATION	.

		MR.
IRVING	PERSON	' S SHYLOCK .

		In none of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , probably , have opinions concerning the fundamental idea of the play and the nature of its leading character differed more widely than in the case of '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		Most of the German critics have consid - ered the centre of gravity of the play to lie in Por - tia 's address to Mercy ; Gervinus maintains that the poet wished to delineate man 's relation to pro- perty ; still more astonishing is the theory of Hebler that the central thought is the struggle against ap - pearances , and that
Bassanio	PERSON	's speech when select - ing the casket contains the key to the poem .

		The actors have differed quite as much as the critics in their interpretations of this play .

		When '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' was first brought to light again after the closing of the theatres by the Pu - ritans , it had suffered such mutilation , changes , and additions , as to be scarcely recognizable .

		One among many adaptations was a musical masque by Lord Lansdowne entitled '' Peleus and Thetis , '' intro - ducing a banqueting scene in which Shylock , seated at a separate table , gave a toast to the god Money .

		Strangely enough , this conception of the character , designed specially to provoke the mirth of the au - dience , held the boards for about a quarter of a century .

		Not until nearly the middle of the eigh - teenth century was - popular taste sufficiently edu - cated to give up its clown and welcome a revival of a true Shylock uttering the great poet 's own words .

		It was
Charles Macklin	PERSON	's performance that again presented '' the very Jew that
Shakespeare	PERSON	drew , '' and the date was the fifteenth of
February , 1741	DATE	, a date truly memorable in the annals of the English stage .

		After
Macklin	PERSON	, no other great Shylock appeared until
Edmund Kean	PERSON	, who per - sisted in making his debut on the
London	LOCATION	stage in this character .

		Until that night ,
Edmund Kean	PERSON	had been a poor , obscure , insignificant actor ; but by his intuition and insistence '' Shylock or noth - ing , '' he had said , he not only saved his manager from impending financial ruin , but , by a perform - ance more electrifying and magnetic than
Mack	PERSON	- lin 's , permanently established his own fame .

		Since then many great actors have rivalled each other in their interpretation of this wonderful char - acter , our own generation having produced three very pronounced types .

		In
Edwin Booth	PERSON	we saw a sordid and shabby old Jew , wearing but one sign of wealth and power , a great ruby which glowed upon his clutching finger .

		Moved more by avarice than by revenge , the revengefulness arose from reasons personal rather than racial .

		Shylock 's greed to '' feed FAT the ancient grudge '' his bitterness in sum - marizing his personal slights from
Antonio	LOCATION	, together with his exultation over the fact that
Antonio	PERSON	had now come to him for help , were , in Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's presentation , the most forceful lines , the rest of the play seeming to develop from these through the agency of the events that precipitated the Jew to - ward his defeated revenge .

		Very different was the Shylock of
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	.

		He avoided all shabby meanness , whether of speech , or dress , or conduct .

		Tall , robed in a black Jewish gaberdine bordered with red and marked with a red cross on the elbow , moving slowly and with dignity , Shylock 's eager and crafty nature was betrayed chiefly by the manner in which his hands , richly - jewelled , clutched and twined up - on his long knotted staff .

		A Shylock intense in feel - ing , but restrained by habits of custom and remem - brance of many hurts helplessly received , a pent - up nature which allowed itself only guarded chances to justify itself for its `` lodged hate and certain loathing , '' a sufferer who retained the dignity of old age in his outward appearance , along with the dignity of a rooted purpose too wise to unfold itself abruptly even in the great trial scene , these were the main characteristics of Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's rendering .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's performances of the past two weeks in
Chicago	LOCATION	furnish occasion to inquire concerning his contribution to the history of the stage-presenta - tions of Shylock .

		It is said that he follows , in a measure , the interpretation of
Edmund Kean	PERSON	; but we suspect that the character as rendered by Mr.
Irving	PERSON	is a much more complex one than would have been conceived by a man of
Kean	PERSON	's genera - tion , or appreciated by
Kean	PERSON	's audiences .

		Is it saying too much for ourselves that , before the pres - ent day , men were oblivious of the mixed influences of heredity and environment which go to the mak - ing of Irving 's Shylock ?

		Is it even going too far to urge that only a community recently stirred as this has been by a
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	would be so ready to respond in sympathy with the repre - sentative and scapegoat of a persecuted race ?

		Whatever the cause , certain it is that never before , either by the stage or the printed page , has one been so impressed with a sense of the shameful way in which Shylock is baited and badgered , so filled with sympathy at the end of the Trial for the broken and ruined man who , for all his narrowness and sor - didness and vindictiveness , is yet so clearly the vic - tim of race prejudice and so-called religious zeal .

		Whether Shakespeare intended to excite these emotions in the spectator is a question quite apart ; 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, it is not less but more honor to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	that the nineteenth century man can read between his lines some things that he himself may not have felt in the writing .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's Shylock is a character whose ruling motive in life is to avenge the wrongs of his race , wrongs which were committed long before the open - ing of the play , long before he himself was born .

		Chance throws Antonio into his power ; and
Anto	PERSON	- nio , as the representative of the age-long persecu - tion , shall pay the penalty .

		As it is the art of the great dramatist to introduce all his leading charac - ters very early in his play , to foreshadow his plot very early in the story , so it is the art of the great actor to convey very soon and unmistakably the impression of the character he intends .

		We get our clue to Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's Shylock at his first appear - ance on the stage , where every accent and modula - tion and pause are made to give force to that won - derful summary of his wrongs , ending , '' What should I say to you ?

		Should I not say ' Hath a DOG money ?

		Is it possible A CUB can lend three thousand ducats ? '

		Or Shall I bend low , and in a bondman 's key , With bated breath and whispering humbleness , Say this : ' Fair sir , you spet on me on
Wednesday	DATE	last ; You spurn ' d me such a day ; another time You call 'd me dog ; and for these COURTESIES I 'll lend you thus much moneys ? ' ''

		Again , the actor 's art is quite as apparent by the passages he subordinates as by those he emphasizes .

		In the beginning of the third act , Shylock passes through many various emotions : his daughter has flown , taking with her his ducats and his jewels , he would that she were dead at his foot , so that the jewels were in her ear ; Antonio has lost an argosy at sea ;
Jessica	PERSON	has parted with his wife 's ring in barter for a monkey .

		The old actors made much of the conflicting emotions here , especially of Shy - lock 's joy when he suddenly learns of Antonio 's losses .


Edwin Booth	PERSON	in playing this scene stood at the back of the stage when he heard these tidings .

		Flinging his arms over his head , he came stagger - ing down in mighty strides to the footlights ; sob - bing in a delirium of revengeful joy , and throwing himself into
Tubal	ORGANIZATION	's arms , he cried aloud , '' I thank God !

		I thank God !

		Is it true ?

		is it true ? ''

		When Irving hears the same news he is stand - ing by the side of his friend .

		There is an inartic - ulate moan ; a moment 's hesitation , as if doubting the truth of the report ; an eager , tremulous grasp - ing of both Tubal 's hands ; but the actual words , '' Is it true ?

		is it true ? ''

		are scarcely heard .

		Booth expressed one overmastering passion ; Irving sug - gests the complex passions of the
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	's heart .

		When the scene is ended , it is not these words that ring in the memory so much as the tremendous logic by which he has justified himself for his in - tention to exact his bond .

		It is hard to fancy any higher reach of the dramatic art than the repressed but cumulative force of the questions , '' Hath not a Jew eyes ?

		hath not a Jew hands , organs , di - mensions , senses , affections , passions ?

		fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same dis - eases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and
summer	DATE	, as a Christian is ?

		If you prick us , do we not bleed ?

		If you tickle us , do we not laugh ?

		if you poison us , do we not die ?

		and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?

		If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .

		If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humil - ity ?

		Revenge .

		If a Christian wrong a Jew , what should his sufferance be , by Christian example ?

		Why , revenge . ''

		Certainly no one who has heard it will be likely soon to forget the tone and gesture with which Mr.
Irving	PERSON	concludes , '' The villany you teach me , I will execute ; and it shall go hard but I will BETTEK THE INSTRUCTION . ''

		No monster this , but a fellow human being , goaded , stung , outraged , until patience has ceased to be admirable , and revenge seems almost a virtue .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's Shylock never raves , but it is at this point that his suppressed and consummate hate comes nearest to violent outbreak ; it is all the more effective because of his usual self-control ; after this , it is impossible to regard him merely as a disgust - ing miser , destitute of ordinary human feelings , but as a type of natural sufferings and antipathies produced by a bitter sense of long-continued wrong .

		No possible opportunity is lost to strengthen this conviction in the audience .

		An action , slight in itself , but tremendous in effect , is introduced into the trial scene .

		Bassanio stands before Shylock with hands extended , saying , '' For thy three thousand ducats , here is six . ''

		Shylock approaches him .

		The short , sharp knife which he holds in his hand is raised ; three times a measured , ringing blow falls on the coins , before he answers , calmly but inflexibly : '' If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts , and every part a ducat , I would not draw them ; I would have my ftonrf . ''

		Yes , Shylock is cruel .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's interpreta - tion does not blind us to that fact ; but it does open our eyes to the wrongs that have been inflicted and continue to be inflicted in the name of the Christian religion ; it does set us to thinking anew concerning the manner in which the individual becomes largely the product of his environment ; it does lead us to ask ourselves what blame we shall dare attach to a man who , although sinning , has also been severely sinned againsfr ; it does force us to inquire whether the same old spirit still survives and whether it does not rather savor of hatred of the Jew than of love of the
Nazarene	LOCATION	.

		THE EAST AND THE WEST , ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have just read your editorial on '' The Literary West , '' in THE DIAL of
October 1	DATE	, with the more interest that I had shortly before read Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's article in the last '' Forum '' on the same subject .

		I am a good Westerner , but I confess to having less interest
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 217 in this discussion than in a question which lies deeper , and is , I suspect , fundamental to it .

		That question con - cerns the relative importance of substance and form in literary production .

		Is our coming literature to be chiefly a medium of instruction , of moral impulse and inspiration , or of mere -LCB- esthetic or intellectual enjoy - ment ?

		Is it to be dominated most by the living in - stincts of those who write and those who read , or by the so-called art-spirit ?

		What is the true proportion between this art-spirit and a more didactic purpose ?

		In a word , how real and strong and vital are we willing our literature should become ?

		The West is more receptive and more practical than the
East	LOCATION	, while the East is more finished and cautious than the
West	LOCATION	.

		The literary consciousness of the West , as represented in a writer like Mr.
Garland	PERSON	, is pro- foundly stirred by those new ideals which demand a larger thought and life-content in literature , which would make it the servant of humanity 's most pressing needs , using it to stimulate thought , elevate social conditions and standards , sweeten and ennoble life all round .

		This is a sound and worthy ambition , which must sooner or later realize itself in all the schools ; but it is as easy to fall into a dogmatic and partisan spirit in the asser - tion of higher claims and possibilities here as elsewhere .

		It seems to me that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's enthusiastic advo - cacy of the merits of one geographical section is colored by suspicion and hostility toward another .

		As a
Wes	PERSON	- terner again , '' methinks he doth protest too much . ''

		I would rather wait for our peculiar merits to reveal themselves to
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	recognition and to the world 's recognition than join in the ardent advance proclama - tion of voices that , despite their high and generous ring , betray a tone of self-interest .

		I sympathise with much of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	'S discontent over the kind of criticism the West often suffers from the
East	LOCATION	, but I am sometimes more discouraged by our friends ' replies to these criti - cisms than by the critics themselves .

		Whatever wins here , it will not be the spirit of self-assertion .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	belongs to that class of writers , of which
Helen Gardiner	PERSON	is a still more marked example , who care more about life than about any theories of the art which seeks to express and represent life : a choice wisely made from both the moralist 's and artist 's point of view , entirely consonant with the best modern tendencies .

		Nevertheless , it is as true now as it ever was that liter - ature is an art , and can live only as it embodies itself in beautiful and imperishable forms .

		Exclusive atten - tion to form will not secure this imperishability except as literary relic and curio ; but neither will mere atten - tion to motive and substance secure it , as some of our literary didacticians seem to think .

		The novel may well be made the mouthpiece of a great idea , unveiling some social wrong or abuse , stimulating men to clearer thinking and better living ; but unless in serving this immediate and particular aim it observes a higher loy - alty to rules of wider scope relating to life on its uni - versal plane , unless it is as true to life as a whole as to the special phase it attempts to portray , the book must fail as literature , however it may deserve to live as po - lemics and moral argument .

		This new contention between the East and the
West	LOCATION	bears too many marks of a family quarrel that sad - dest of all family quarrels where the older and younger members are at strife .

		It is unseemly , and should end .

		It is , however , less a downright struggle for pre - cedence than a natural disagreement between age and experience on the one hand and youth and the spirit of adventure on the other .

		The East stands loyally by its acquired results ; it likes the old patterns , and is too proae to be satisfied with things as they are .

		The West has no acquired results , wholly its own , let us be hon - est and admit this , any more than it has results wholly its own in its political laws or institutions ; but it has rapidly-acquiring results in all fields .

		THE DIAL is right in saying that there is no justifiable use of the terms '' Eastern '' and '' Western '' in this connection ex - cept as regards the subject-matter ; but even this dis - tinction fails too often to establish a rule .

		The writings of Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	and Octave Thanet of the West , and of
Egbert Craddock	PERSON	of the South , have the same literary flavor as those of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	and
Miss Jewett	PERSON	.

		They belong equally to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	school , if there is such a school .

		It is this literary flavor , impossible to de - fine , but as sweet and pungent and lasting as the scent of sandal-wood , which we almost invariably miss in the writer who proudly avows he has only an ethical pur - pose to serve .

		It is time to drop the use of terms that are only confusing and irritating .

		Those standards of literary worth established in the name and fame of a few men of
New England	LOCATION	descent are American and national .

		Does anyone think of Emerson or Lowell as an '' Easterner '' ?

		Let us accept the inheritance here offered , proudly and gratefully , as we accept that other inheritance bestowed in teachings of
Jefferson	PERSON	and the Adamses .

		I can not but think our
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	friends behave as well as we do in this matter ; if they have betrayed some ignorance and prejudice in what they have said of us , they have also covered us with praise and unaffected admiration , especially during this World 's Fair year ; and this praise has been bestowed not only on the marvel - lous exhibit at
Jackson Park	LOCATION	, but on achievements of a different order connected with our remarkable series of Congresses .

		Words of highest eulogium have been spoken of the mental activity of
Chicago	LOCATION	and the Mid - dle West , accompanied with expression of envious ad - miration for the freedom and breadth that mark life everywhere in this newer region .

		Power , Opportunity , Freedom , these are the words of large and lasting import in which the general verdict at home and abroad clothes its loving prophecy of us .

		Shall we then complain because along with such meas - ure of faith and applause we are sometimes rebuked and laughed at for the sins of haste and self-sufficiency , the errors and misdemeanors of youth ?

		Do we not know we have been guilty of such sins and errors , that we are guilty of them still ?

		There is no better sign of maturity than the power to estimate aright our neigh - bor 's virtues and our own faults .

		The West has not yet outgrown all self-delusion in this respect , but she will outgrow it , and then the period of self-glorification will have passed away .

		THE GEOGRAPHICAL IMPORTANCE OF TOMFOOLERY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Every self-respecting writer and scholar in the
West	LOCATION	owes THE DIAL hearty thanks for its defence of them against the literary tomfooleries and gaucheries which too often are supposed to represent '' the Literary West . ''

		If those critics who live nearer the sunrise could be persuaded to leave out geography in their admiration of these crudities it would be a distinct gain for the 218 -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, whole country .

		Literary tomfoolery ought not to be in - teresting simply because it comes from the interior .

		Yet it is made interesting for that very reason by the conde - scending
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	critic , who persists in regarding it as delightfully characteristic of the
West	LOCATION	.

		I am not sure , however , that American literature will have no geo - graphical traits .

		Such traits are obvious enough in British letters ; and American literature the best of it is sharply accentuated as American .

		We might re - taliate , if we were not magnanimous ; worthless stuff is printed by uncultured aspirants east of the Alleghauies .

		What if we treated that as
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	literature ?

		And yet I suppose we shall have to take our medicine in this grace of condescension ;
New England	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	took it in their turn , and
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	in their turn .

		What chiefly is new in this matter is the geographical importance of literary tomfoolery , which is foisted on people who abhor it , and is made to repre - sent people who are ashamed of it .

		Their precise griev - ance is the potency of tomfoolery .

		The rest of it the gracious and unctuous condescension we can stand , until our best work commands a more respectful atti - tude .

		Our penance will be ended , probably , before

		For the purpose of showing that a word or its employ - ment is not peculiarly American , the quotations cited above are as good evidence as if they were taken from the writings of

		But Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	, in a letter published in '' The Academy , ''
March 25 , 1893	DATE	, under the headline '' The American Dialect , '' cites , as one among numerous examples of '' indefensible '' Americanisms , this sentence : ''
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	... was born in
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	brings forward this and many other quotations from an American schoolbook for the purpose of illustrating `` locutions which go far to realize finished debasement . ''

		However , we have seen that British usage requires the employment of in after born before
London	LOCATION	, and per - mits its use before the names of other large cities , at least before the names of other large cities not in En - gland .

		The only thing questionable , then , in `` born in
Boston	LOCATION	'' is whether in is properly used before
Boston	LOCATION	little as well as
Boston	LOCATION	big , whether , in other words , a writer should distinguish by the preposition chosen the rather insignificant
Boston	LOCATION	that was

		What perplexities would beset writers of biography who tried to make such a distinction general , may be imagined .

		Fancy the application of a similar test of correctness to the at 's and in 's of authors writing about the Middle Ages .

		THE DIAL 219 OLD-TIME DAYS isr
NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* In her '' Customs and Fashions in Old
New England	LOCATION	, ''
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	has given us a readable and a very serviceable book .

		It is not - ably free from padding , the extracts and ex - amples are well chosen and well ordered , and the running commentary is pithy and shows on occasion much appreciation of the quaint hu - mors of Puritan life .

		A fair notion of the range and tenor of the volume may be formed from topical headings under which the text is divided .

		These are : '' Child Life , '' '' Court - ship and Marriage Customs , '' '' Domestic Ser - vice , '' `` Home Interiors , '' `` Table Plenishings , '' '' Larder Supplies , '' '' Holidays , '' `` Diversions , '' '' Books and Book-Makers , '' '' Doctors and Patients , '' '' Artifices of Handsomeness , '' `` Fu - neral and Burial Customs . ''

		The work through - out shows painstaking research and logical methods ; and while its chief end is perhaps en - tertainment , its copious extracts from original records will be found of practical value .

		Someone observed of
Bacon	LOCATION	and
Des Cartes	LOCATION	that it was their prime merit in philosophy to have begun at the beginning .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has also begun at the beginning .

		Her took opens with a summary of the woes of the Puritan baby ; and when we add that it closes with a collection of Puritan epitaphs , it will be seen that the ground is gone over pretty thoroughly .

		Infancy in Old
New England	LOCATION	was not , on the author 's showing , a halcyon period .

		`` From the time , '' she says , '' when the Puritan baby opened his eyes in bleak
New England	LOCATION	he had a Spartan struggle for life . ''

		The struggle seems to have begun with baptism , and this ceremony was regularly performed on the Sun - day following the child 's birth .

		As Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	feelingly observes : '' When we consider the chill and gloom of those un - lieated , freezing churches , growing colder and damper with every wintry blast we wonder that grown per - sons even could bear the exposure .

		Still more do we marvel that tender babes ever lived through their cruel winter christenings , when it is recorded that the ice had to be broken in the christening-bowl ... One cruel parson believed in and practised infant immersion , fairly a Puritan torture , until his own child nearly lost its life thereby . ''

		The mortality among infants , we learn , was appallingly large .

Samuel Sewall	PERSON	's fourteen children but three survived him , a ma - * CUSTOMS AND FASHIONS IN OLD NEW ENGLAND .

		jority dying in infancy ; while of his friend Cotton Mather 's fifteen children '' but two sur - vived their father . ''

		While these facts are sig - nificant , we are scarcely prepared to admit , what our author darkly hints , that this early mortality was largely the result of premature baptism .

		It is not unlikely , however , that the dangerous coalition of cold water , cold church , and cold parson found an occasional victim .

		If the child survived baptism , it had other perils to face in the shape of various strange nostrums of the day , among which we note our old friend '' Daffy 's Elixir '' favorably known to colonial Mrs.
Gamps	PERSON	as an effectual stu - pefier .

		Second in fame to the '' Elixir '' was a choice compound known as '' snail-water '' ; and we may add parenthetically -LRB- on the author - ity of Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	-RRB- that snails formed the basis or main ingredient of many colonial remedies .

		Children were , of course , the chief victims ; and the number of snails that a well-regulated
Puri	PERSON	- tan baby swallowed in the course of a year seems to have been something prodigious .

		Says Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	: '' I should fancy that snails must have been almost exterminated in the near vicinity of towns , so largely were they sought for and employed medicinally . ''

		We subjoin the form - ula most favored for this strange medicament : '' The admirable and most famous Snail water .

		Take a peck of garden
Shel Snails	PERSON	, wash them well in Small Beer , and put them in an oven till they have done making a Noise , then take them out and wipe them well from the green froth that is upon them , and bruise them shels and all in a Stone Mortar , then take a Quart of Earthworms , scowre them with salt , slit them , and wash well with water from their filth , and in a stone Mortar beat them in pieces , then lay in the bot - tom of your distilled pot Angelica two handfuls , and two handfuls of Celandine upon them , to which put two quarts of Rosemary flowers ,

Agrimony	LOCATION	, red Dock roots , Bark of Barberries , Betony wood Sorrel of each two handfuls , Rue one handful ; then lay the Snails and Worms on the top of the hearbs and flowers , then pour on three Gallons of the Strongest Ale , and let it stand all night , in the morning put in three ounces of Cloves beaten , sixpennyworth of beaten Saffron , and on top of them six ounces of shaved

		Of course Puritan childhood was not , figur - atively speaking , all mid-winter baptism and snail-water .

		That it had its flowers and its sun - shine -LRB- both perhaps a little wintry -RRB- , our au - thor 's interesting chapter on '' Child Life '' at - tests .

		There were , too , children 's books in those early days , most of them , it is true , of the severely '' improving , '' not to say peniten - 220 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Or Cotton Mather 's '' Some examples of Children in whom the fear of God was remarkably Budding before they died ; in sev - eral parts of
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		Less serious were the books in the list pub - lished in
1787	DATE	by
Isaiah Thomas	PERSON	.

		Here we find such cheerful titles as '' Tom Jones Abridged , '' `` Peregrine Pickle Abridged , '' `` The Sugar Plum , '' etc. ; while another advertisement of the same date contains , among the books for misses , the very un-Puritanical titles `` The Elopement , '' '' The Passionate Lovers , '' '' Original Love Let - ters , '' and '' Six Dialogues of Young Misses Re - lating to Matrimony . ''

		In her amusing chapter on '' Courtship and Marriage Customs , '' Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	observes : '' In the early days of the
New England	LOCATION	colonies no more embarrassing or hampering condition , no greater temporal ill , could befall any adult Puritan than to be unmarried .

		What could he do , how could he live , in that new land , without a wife ? ''

		To the normal and general evils of celibacy Puritanism added special and local ones .

		A multiplicity of legal and social penalties and discouragements were levelled against bache - lorhood .

		The bachelor was a '' suspect '' before the law , a pariah , an intruder , a persona non grata in the social circle .

		Overlooking the facts that the bachelor habit , once contracted , is hard to shake off , and that in nine cases out of ten the bachelor himself is the last one to blame for his condition , the Puritan Solous proceeded against him with inquisitorial sever - ity .

		He was seldom permitted to live alone or to choose his own residence , but had to live wherever and with whomsoever the Court pleased .

		In
Hartford	LOCATION	he was regularly brought up and fined twenty shillings a week on princi - ple a most arbitrary proceeding .

		Everywhere he was under the spying and tattling super - vision of the constable , the watchman , and the ti thing-man , who diligently reported -LRB- and doubt - less perverted -RRB- his '' scircumstances and con - uersation . ''

		In
Eastham	LOCATION	a law was passed that '' Every unmarried man in the township shall kill six blackbirds or three crows while he remains singjle ; as a penalty for not doing it , shall not be married until he obey this order . ''

		The logic of this ornithological enactment is not apparent .

		As bachelors who were proof against penalties might possibly yield to in - ducements , certain towns held out '' incurridge - ment '' to wedlock in the form of home-lots to - build upon .

		These were assignable upon mar - riage ; and the author records that '' in Med - field there was a so-called Bachelors ' Row , which had been thus assigned . '' ''

		Old Maids '' were , we regret to learn , also under the colonial ban , though they came off more lightly , perhaps owing to the fact that their sex is debarred from the matrimonial in - itiative . ''

		The state of old-maidism , '' says the author , '' was reached at a very early age in those early days ;
Higginson	PERSON	wrote of an ' an - tient maid ' of twenty-five years . ''


John Dun	PERSON	- ton , in his '' Life and Errors , '' thus defends an ideal member of the maligned sisterhood : '' It is true an old -LRB- or superanuated -RRB- Maid in
Boston	LOCATION	is thought such a curse , as nothing can exceed it -LRB- and looked on as a dismal spectacle -RRB- yet she by her good nature , gravity , and strict virtue convinces all -LRB- so much as the fleering Beaus -RRB- that it is not her necessity but her choice that keeps her a Virgin .

		She is now about thirty years -LRB- the age which they call a Thornback -RCB- yet she never disguises herself , and talks as little as she thinks , of Love .

		She never reads any Plays or Romances , goes to no Balls or Dancing-match -LRB- as they do who go to such Fairs -RRB- to meet with
Chapmen	PERSON	.

		Her looks , her speech , her whole behavior are so very chaste , that but once -LRB- at
Governor 's Island	LOCATION	, where we went to be merry at roasting a hog -RRB- going to kiss her , I thought she would have blushed to death ... But as the Damsel I have been describing would neither anticipate or contradict the will of her Parents , so do I assure you she is against Forcing her own , by marrying where she can not love ; and that is the reason she is still a Virgin . ''

		While strongly encouraging wedlock ,
Puri	PERSON	- tanism took due care , however , that it was not rashly contracted .

		In the sight of the law , in - considerate courting was only a shade better than no courting at all .

		Hard indeed was the lot of the swain who ventured on love-making without first obtaining the sanction of parents or guardians . ''

		Fines , imprisonment , or the whipping-post awaited him , did he ' inveigle the affections of any maide or maide-servant * by making love to her without proper author - ity . ''

		Numberless examples , says Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	, might be given to prove that this law was na dead letter .

		In
1647	DATE	, in
Stratforde	LOCATION	, one Will Colefoxe was fined X5 for '' laboring to invegle the affection of Write his daughter . ''

		In 1672
Jonathan Coventry	PERSON	of
Plymouth	LOCATION	town was in - dicted for '' making a motion of marriage '' to
Katherine Dudley	PERSON	without obtaining formal permission . ''

		The Governor of
Plymouth	LOCATION	colony ,
Thomas Prence	PERSON	, did not hesitate to drag his daughter 's love affairs be -

		THE DIAL 221 fore the public , in
1660	DATE	, by prosecuting
Arthur Hub	PERSON	- bard for ' disorderly and unrighteously endeavouring to gain the affections of Mistress
Elizabeth Prence	PERSON	. '

		The unrighteous lover was fined 5 .

		Seven years later , pa - tient
Arthur	PERSON	, who would not ' refrain and desist , ' was again fined the same amount ; but love prevailed over law , and he triumphantly married his fair
Elizabeth	PERSON	a few months later .

		The marriage of a daughter with an unwelcome swain was also often prohibited by will , ' not to suffer her to be circumvented and cast away upon a swaggering gentleman . ' ''

		It is needless to say that Puritan maids sometimes sided with their unsanctioned lovers .

		The remarkable case of
Sarah Tuttle	PERSON	is in point . ''

		On
May	DATE	day in
New Haven	LOCATION	in
1660	DATE	, she went to the house of a neighbor ,
Dame Murline	PERSON	, to get some thread .

		Some very loud jokes were exchanged between
Sarah	PERSON	and her friends
Maria	PERSON	and
Susan Murline	PERSON	so loud , in fact , that
Madame Murliiie	ORGANIZATION	testified in court that it ' much distressed her and put her in a sore strait . '

		In the midst of all this doubtful fun
Jacob Miirline	PERSON	en - tered , and seizing
Sarah	PERSON	's gloves , demanded the cen - turies-old forfeit of a kiss . '

		Whereupon , ' writes the scandalized Puritan chronicler , ' they sat down together ; his arm being around her ; and her arm upon his shoulder or about his neck ; and hee kissed her , and shee kissed him , or they kissed one another , continuing in this posture about half an hour , as
Maria	LOCATION	and
Susan	PERSON	tes - tified . '


Goodman Tuttle	PERSON	, who was a man of dignity and importance , angrily brought suit against
Jacob	PERSON	for in - veigling his daughter 's affections ; ` but
Sarah	PERSON	being asked in court if
Jacob	PERSON	inveagled her , said No . '

		This of course prevented any rendering of judgment against the unauthorized kissing by
Jacob	PERSON	, and he escaped the severe punishment of his offence .

		But the outraged and baffled court fined
Sarah	PERSON	, and gave her a severe lec - ture , calling her with justice a '
Bould Virgin	PERSON	. '

		She at the end , demurely and piously answered that ` She hoped God would help her to carry it Better for time to come . '

		And doubtless she did carry it better ; for at the end of two years , this bold virgin 's fine for unruly behavior being still unpaid , half of it was remitted . ''

		From the interesting chapter on '' Books and Book-Makers '' our remaining space allows us a few skimmings .

		There was , says Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	, no calling more reputable and profitable in early colonial days than the trade of book-sell - ing , which then included publishing .


John Dunton	PERSON	, who landed in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1686	DATE	, thus eulogizes the four book-sellers which that city then boasted : Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	was `` very just , very thriving , young , witty , '' and the `` most Beautifull man in the town of
Boston	LOCATION	'' withal ; Mr.
Brunning	PERSON	-LRB- or
Browning	PERSON	-RRB- was a '' complete book-seller , generous and trustworthy '' a man who would promote a good book whoever printed it ; Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	was '' very industri - ous , dresses All-a-mode -LSB- sic -RSB- , and I am told a young lady of Great Fortune is fallen in love with him '' ; of Mr.
Usher	PERSON	, the fourth book - dealer ,
Dunton	PERSON	asserts that `` He makes the best figure in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He is very rich , adven - tures much to sea , but has got his estate by Book selling . ''

		Usher , it is recorded , died worth 20,000 a large sum at that time .

		As nine-tenths of the authors were ministers , and the publishers were all deacons , the church had a sort of monopoly of the trade .

		Book-print - ing , too , was an honored calling . ''

		The first machine for the craft and mystery of print - ing was set up at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1639	DATE	, and for twenty - three years the president of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	was re - sponsible for its performances .

		Then official licensers were appointed to control its productions , and not till a decade of years before the Declaration of Independence were legal restraints removed from the colonial press . ''

		The first printer in the colony ,
Steeven Day	PERSON	, was , Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	thinks , '' about as bad a printer as ever lived , as his work in the
Bay Psalm	LOCATION	- Book proves . ''

		Nor were
Steeven	ORGANIZATION	's shortcom - ings solely of a professional nature .

		He spent a term in the county jail , and seems , on the whole , to have been a sore trial to the godly ministers , his business associates .

		The second colonial printer '' had to sleep in a cask after he landed '' ; and the third printer , one
Johnson	PERSON	, having left a wife in
England	LOCATION	, was prudently bound over by the Court not to '' invegle '' the affections of the daughter of printer number two .


Dunton	PERSON	, who was a book-seller , took back to
England	LOCATION	but 400 ; and he gives the
Boston Yankees	ORGANIZATION	a very bad name in commercial deal - ings : '' There is no trading for a stranger with them but with a Grecian Faith which is not to part with your own ware without ready Money ; for they are generally very backward in their payments ; great censors about other Mens manner but
Extremely Careless	ORGANIZATION	about their own .

		When you are dealing with 'em you must look upon 'em as at cross purposes and read 'em like Hebrew back - ward ; for they seldom speak & mean the same thing but like the Watermen Look one way and row another . ''

		Josselyn gave them no better name , saying : Their leading men are damnable rich , inexplicably covetous and proud ; like Ethiopians , white in the teeth only ; full of ludification and injurious dealing . ''

		In the early days of American book-making there were no native novels : '' The first book deserving the appellation that was printed in
New England	LOCATION	was ' intituled ' ' The Power of Sympathy , or the
Triumph of Nature A Novel	ORGANIZATION	founded on Truth and dedicated to the
Young Ladies of Amer	ORGANIZATION	- ica . '

		It appeared in
1789	DATE	.

		Four years later came ' The Helpless Orphan , or The Innocent Victim of Revenge , ' and then ' The Coquette , or the History of Eliza Whar - ton . '

		Colonial '' authoresses '' were rare perhaps owing to the prevalence of sentiments thus ex - pressed by Governor Winthrop : 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, '' The Governor of
Hartford	LOCATION	upon
Connecticut	LOCATION	came to
Boston	LOCATION	, and brought his wife with him -LRB- a godly young woman and of special parts -RRB- who was fallen into a sad infirmity , the loss of her understanding and reason which had been growing upon her divers years by occa - sion of her giving herself wholly to reading and writing , and had written many books .

		Her husband being very loving and tender of her , was loath to grieve her ; but he saw his error when it was too late .

		For if she had attended her household affairs , and such things as be - long to women , and not gone out of her way and call - ing to meddle in such things as are proper for men , whose minds are stronger , etc. , she had kept her wits , and might have improved them usefully and honorably in the place God had set her . ''

		The relations between publishers and au - thors , and between publishers and the public , seem to have been '' most friendly . ''

		There was much bandying of compliments as may be gathered from the following announcements : `` A New Edition of the really beautiful & senti - mental Novel Armine and Elvira Is this day published price 9d sewed in blue paper .

		To the Ladies in partic - ular and others the lovers of Sentiment and
Poetick Numbers	ORGANIZATION	this Novel is recommended , to them it will afford a delightful Repast .

		To others it is not an ob - ject . '' ''

		For the pleasing entertainment of the Polite Part of Mankind I have printed the most beautiful Poems of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	Duck the famous
Wiltshire	LOCATION	Poet .

		It is a full Demonstration to me that the People of New En - gland have a fine Taste for good Sense and polite Learn - ing having already sold 1200 of these Poems . '' ''

		'T is said with truth by a secret but ingenious
New England	LOCATION	minister that no town is so worthy the vendue of this pleasing book as these polite gentlemen and gen - tlewomen to whom it will be on
Friday	DATE	offered . ''

		A public must be hard-hearted indeed to with - stand such blandishments !

		Authors -LRB- if not '' authoresses '' -RRB- were treated with respect nay , with encouragement .

		They were even urged to write as this advertise - ment , from the ''
New England	LOCATION	Weekly Jour - nal '' of
March , 1728	DATE	, attests : '' There is now preparing for the Press , and may upon Suitable Encouragement be communicated to the Pub - lick , a
Miscellany of Poems of Severall Hands	ORGANIZATION	and upon severall occasions some of which have already been Pub - lished and received the Approbation of the best Judges with many more very late performances of equal if not superior Beauty which have never yet seen the Light ; if therefore any Ingenious Gentlemen are disposed to contribute towards the erecting of a Poetickal Monu - ment for the honour of This Country Either by their Generous Subscriptions or Composures , they are desired to convey them to Mr.
Daniel Henchman	PERSON	or the Publisher of this Paper by whom they will be received with Can - dour and Thankfulness . ''


Boston	LOCATION	had a public library at a very early day .

		By
1673	DATE	bequests had been made to such an institution , and consignments for it had been received from
London	LOCATION	book-sellers .

		The Prince library , the first large American book collec - tion , was started by
Thomas Prince	PERSON	in
1703	DATE	, and deserved , says the author , '' more gratitude and more care than it received at modern hands . ''

		But many towns had no public libra - ries , and there was , hence , much friendly inter - change of books among neighbors .

		That the col - onial book-borrower did not vary notably from the original type may be gathered from adver - tisements of the period .

		Here is a pleasantly naive one from the ''
Boston	LOCATION	News Letter '' of
July 7 , 1712	DATE	: '' A certain Person having lent two Books viz ; Rush - worths
Collections & Fullers Holy War &	ORGANIZATION	forgotten unto whom ; These are desiring the Borrower to be so kind as to return said Books unto Owner . ''

		In the ''
Connecticut Courant	ORGANIZATION	'' we find this sar - castic notice : '' The gentleman who took the second volume of
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- cons Abridgement from Mr.
David Balls	PERSON	bedroom on the
18th of November	DATE	would do well to return it to the owner whose name he will find on the 15th Page .

		If he choose rather to keep it the owner wishes him to call and take the rest of the set . ''

		Another
Connecticut	LOCATION	borrower is mildly asked to '' return the 3rd Vol .

		of
Don Quixote &	ORGANIZATION	take the 4th instead if he chuse . ''

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	finds that
Connecticut	LOCATION	folk were especially given '' to this slipshod fashion of promiscuous and unli - censed book-borrowing . ''

		In some advertise - ments it is even darkly hinted that '' specifica - tions of books long lent have been given '' -LRB- pro- bably to the sheriff -RRB- ; while one ungallant soul fiercely advertised for '' the she-person that bor - rowed Mr.
Thomas Brown	PERSON	's Works from a gen - tleman she is well acquainted with . ''

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has brought together in compact and logical form a variety of facts hitherto scat - tered and more or less difficult of access .

		As a concise account of domestic manners in
Old New England	LOCATION	we know of no better book .


E. G. J. RUSSIA	PERSON	AND THE RUSSIANS AS SEEN THROUGH FRIENDLY EYES .

Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, has travelled extensively in
Russia	LOCATION	, and has embodied the result of his studies and observations in three ponderous volumes , the first volume being devoted to `` The Country and Its Inhabitants , '' the second to '' Institutions , '' and the third to '' Religion '' * THE EMPIRE OF THE TSARS AND THE RUSSIANS .

		By

A. T. Ragozin	PERSON	, Member of the
American Oriental Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Part I. ,
The Country	ORGANIZATION	and Its Inhabitants .


New York	LOCATION	: G. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 and church matters .

		Only the first volume has as yet appeared in English or American trans - lations , and no promise is given in regard to more ; but it is to be hoped that translator and publisher will find sufficient encouragement to induce them to give us in English the remain - ing two volumes .


Zenaide A. Ragozin	PERSON	's work is not merely a literal translation .

		She ac - companies the text with a thread of annotations , that bring into stronger light the masterly pic - tures of Russian life historical , social , pop - ular , which Mr.
Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	unfolds be - fore the reader in a series as varied as that life itself .

		In these notes the translator reveals herself as a most loyal Russian , sometimes call - ing the author to task when she thinks he has in any way misrepresented her native country ; but we are bound to say that in some instances her patriotism seems superior to her logic .

		An example or two will suffice .

		In the opening of Book II. , on races and nationality , the author makes the following statement , which would seem to contain the pith of good sense : '' Were
Russia	LOCATION	a lately discovered virgin land , devoid of population , or roamed over only by a few nomadic tribes , she would soon offer to the world the same spec - tacle as the
United States	LOCATION	or
Australia	LOCATION	.

		She would rank with those countries where civilization , having left behind her the old institutions which protected her in - fancy , opens out for herself , on a new soil , a wider and more independent career .

		Left entirely to European civilization ,
Russia	LOCATION	would quickly have rivalled Amer - ica ; for according to a remark made by
Adam Smith	PERSON	as early as the eighteenth century nothing , once the foundations are solidly laid , can equal the rapidly in - creasing prosperity of a colony which , in a free land , is at liberty to construct an entirely new building .

		What makes
Russia	LOCATION	's inferiority is her elderly population , which , by shutting out immigration from the West , robs her of the advantages of the usual marvellous growth of colonies . ''

		To this the translator enters a vigorous protest in this manner : '' Once for all we must protest against this off-hand acceptation of
Russia	LOCATION	's inferiority as a thing understood , not even needing proof or discussion .

		Once for all let it be understood at last , what is so plain as to ' put out one 's eyes , ' in the graphic French phrase , cela cr ` eve les yeux , that
Russia	LOCATION	is inferior in the way that the youngest of a family , who is not yet out of college , is to his elderly brothers , who have had the time and op - portunity to make their mark in the world .

		And it is notorious how often the youngest is the most gifted ; then , adding to his own attainments his elder 's expe - rience , the future is his when he survives them , as , in the course of nature , he must .

		There is nowadays but one opinion on the superior intellectual endowments of the individual Russians ; how then can their country be inferior ? ''

		There scarcely seems occasion for the trans - lator to rise in arms against the author 's claim .

		Mr.
Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	has not disputed the nat - ural endowments of the individual Russian .

		This '' youngest of the family '' may be '' the most gifted , '' and he might give sufficient proof of it if he could get away from established Russian institutions and construct an entirely new building in a land like
America	LOCATION	or Aus - tralia .

		The trouble is , he is now hampered by the old institutions which have protected the infancy of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In the Varagians -LRB- Varangians -RRB- most people are willing to see Norsemen .

		Professor
Thomp	PERSON	- son of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	has , we think , proved that the words
Russia	LOCATION	, Russians -LCB-
Rous	PERSON	,
Rossia	LOCATION	,
Rossiane	PERSON	-RRB- are corruptions of the Swedish roths - menn , that is , rowers , or seafarers .

		They were Norse vikings , who in northern
Russia	LOCATION	became the founders of the Russian empire in the ninth century .

		As the story goes ,
Rurik	PERSON	and his brothers were invited to
Russia	LOCATION	and settled at
Novgorod	ORGANIZATION	in 862 .

		That there was a successful Norse invasion there is no doubt .

		In recent times some ultra patriotic Russians ,
Ilovaishi	LOCATION	,
Eldlonoff	LOCATION	, and
Zabielin	PERSON	, have attacked the view of the Norse origin of the invaders , and see in them only Slavs .

		Mr.
Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	gives the generally accepted Norse view ; but , as might be expected , the translator , who is Rus - sian in every fibre , grows enthusiastic , and pro- tests in a note of two and a half closely printed pages ; but the long discussion surely does more credit to her loyalty to her race than to her scholarship .

		The work here presented to the English - reading public is forbidden in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We wonder at this , since we do not find in the whole volume a word unfriendly either to Rus - sia or to its government ; but autocracy does not allow either its acts or its principles to be discussed , and this is just what Leroy-Beau - lieu ' s book does , and that with a freedom in - compatible with the autocratic system .

		The fact of ostracism is an advantage to the work ; it enables the author to express his friendliness toward
Russia	LOCATION	, its people , and its Tsar , without a doubt being cast upon his independence of spirit .

		The author is anxious to impress upon his readers the fact that we must not apply to
Russia	LOCATION	the same notions and the same rules as to
Europe	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	; for , as he says , '' To do this would be the height of ignorance and unfairness .

		Russia is neither
Europe	LOCATION	nor
Asia	LOCATION	; she is a world by herself , situated between
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	and in a way belonging to both .

		Furthermore , it is not a state of our time .

		If it does belong to
Europe	LOCATION	, it is to a

		If one would really understand
Russia	LOCATION	, one should , to look 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, at her , recede some three or four centuries into the past .

		To imagine , on the faith of the almanacs , that
Russia	LOCATION	as she is and the Emperor
Alexander III	PERSON	.

		belong to the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	, is , in spite of all chrono - logical tables , a gross anachronism .

		The Tsar
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Alexandrovitch	PERSON	, crowned in the
Kremlin	ORGANIZATION	of Mos - cow , is not so much the contemporary of Queen
Vic	PERSON	- toria as of Queen Isabel of
Castile	LOCATION	.

		The uprightness of his intentions , the loftiness of his character , are be - yond all doubt , but neither he nor his people live in the same intellectual atmosphere with ourselves .

		He can with a good conscience sign ukdzes that our conscience condemns . ''

		In eight books , all of absorbing interest , the author discusses the nature , climate , and soil , the races and nationality , the national temper - ament and character , the history and elements of civilization , the social hierarchy , the town and urban classes , the nobility , the peasant , and the emancipation of the serfs , and the mir , the family and village communities of
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians .

		Hitherto we have been limited mainly to the statistical articles to be found in cyclopedias and to magazine articles for our knowledge of this great nation .

		Leroy-Beau - lieu 's work enables us to become as familiar with
Russia	LOCATION	as with any other foreign country .

		In this statement
Mackenzie Wallace	PERSON	's splen - did volumes are not forgotten and the reader will find them a valuable complement to the present work .

		In connection with the discussion of the Slavic race the author puts and answers the question , Is the race deficient in genius ?

		As - suredly not , he says . ''

		It is a noteworthy fact that it was Slavs who opened the way to the West in the two great monuments which inaugurated the modern idea in the Renaissance and the Reformation ; in the disco very of the laws that rule the universe , and in the vindication of freedom for hu - man thought .

		The Pole
Kopernik	PERSON	was the forerunner of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, the
Tchekh John Huss	PERSON	that of Luther .

		These are great titles to glory for the Slavs so great that they are contested by the Germans .

		In the wake of Kopernik and
Huss	PERSON	, the two Slav peoples most closely connected with the West , through religion and vicin - ity ,
Poland	LOCATION	and
Bohemia	LOCATION	, could read off a long roll of men distinguished in letters , sciences , politics , and war .

		And among the southern Slavs , a small republic like
Ragusa	PERSON	could alone furnish an entire gallery of men gifted in all domains .

		Where remoteness from the West and foreign oppression made study impossible and prevented individual names from coming up , the gen - ius of the people has manifested itself in such minstrelsy as has nothing to envy in the finest poetry of the
West	LOCATION	.

		In that kind of popular personal poetry which is so greatly admired in the romanceros of
Spain	LOCATION	, the ballads of
Scotland	LOCATION	, or the songs -LRB- chansons -RRB- of
France	LOCATION	, the Slav , far from yielding the prize to the Latins or Teutons , possibly surpasses both .

		There is nothing more truly poetical than the piesme -LRB- lays -RRB- of
Serbia	LOCATION	and the dumy -LRB- ' reveries ' -RRB- of
Little Russia	LOCATION	; for by way of natural com - pensation , it is among the Slavs least initiated into
Wes	PERSON	- tern culture , that popular poetry has blossomed out most freely . ''

		The author claims that
Russia	LOCATION	is not a con - glomerate patchwork of peoples , like
Turkey	LOCATION	or
Austria	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	resembles
France	LOCATION	in na - tional unity .

		He compares
Russia	LOCATION	to one of those antique mosaic pavements , the ground of which is made out of a single substance and a single color , the border alone showing different pieces and colors .

		In chapters two and three of the third book the author has produced pas - sages of rare beauty , a kind of beauty , indeed , that we do not look for from an historian and po - litical writer .

		In these chapters he describes the Russian character as formed by the struggle against the climate , and shows why
Russia	LOCATION	has not like
Scandinavia	LOCATION	been the cradle of liberty .

		Unable to slip his neck from under the yoke of nature , the Russian has borne that of man more patiently ; the one has bent and fashioned him for the other .

		In the third chapter of Book II .

		to our mind the most fascinating part of the whole volume the author shows how the con - traries of winter ,
spring	DATE	, and
summer	DATE	have re - acted on the national temperament .

		He paints a northern
summer	DATE	in a masterly manner , and closes with this eloquent tribute to
Peter	PERSON	the Great : '' If one is astonished at finding in one people so many traits of character different or even opposite , one can , in the person of
Peter the Great	PERSON	, behold them all united and centred in one man .

		This converging , in one indi - vidual , of so many qualities and defects , so many fea - tures scattered through a nation , has shaped a queer and well-nigh monstrous man , but at the same time one of the most mighty , most enterprising , the best endowed for life and action , whom the world has seen .

		No other nation can boast of owning a great man in whom it can embody all itself , who in his very vices stands out a colossal incarnation of its genius .


Peter	PERSON	, the pupil and imitator of foreigners ,
Peter	PERSON	, who seemed to have set himself the task of violently breaking his people 's na - ture and who has been regarded by the old-time Mos - covites as a sort of anti-Christ ,
Peter	PERSON	is the Russian , the Great Russian par excellence .

		Standing before his face one may say that sovereign and nation explain each other .

		A nation that resembles such a man is sure of a great future .

		If it is apparently wanting in some of those highest or most refined qualities on which man - kind prides itself , it owns those which give power and political greatness . ''

		The reader will find much of interest on the subject of nihilism and on the emancipation of the serfs , the latter subject being treated very comprehensively and with great clearness in Book VII .

		The work contains several good maps , and it is as a whole the most import - ant and valuable work on
Russia	LOCATION	hitherto pub - lished in English .

		THE DIAL 225 Miss REPPLIER 'S `` ESSAYS IN IDLENESS . ''

		* It was the late Mr.
Travers	PERSON	, we believe , who was one day surprised at seeing a certain distin - guished contemporary standing on Wall Street with his hands in his own pockets .

		In some - what the same way is the unprepared reader of Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	's Essays not unf requently surprised in coming across a good thing that is not quoted from
Montaigne	LOCATION	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, or somebody else .

		At first sight Miss Repplier 's own remarks hardly come to view , for the number of her unfamiliar -LRB- but gener - ally excellent -RRB- quotations .

		The literary his - torian of the future will have little difficulty in describing Miss Repplier 's method of work . ''

		Her study , '' he will say , '' was a room sur - rounded by pigeonholes marked with such titles as ' Cats , ' * War , ' ' Words , ' ' Leisure . '

		In this room she was accustomed to sit and read the choicest authors , pencil in hand , and on com - ing across anything about cats , or whatever else , she would copy it off and stick it in the appropriate pigeonhole .

		When any pigeon - hole was full she took out the quotations and wrote an article for the ` Atlantic Monthly , ' using them all . ''

		Now such a mode of compo - sition has its difficulties .

		In the present case the quotations are generally good and the net result almost always entertaining .

		But a book abounding in quotations rarely impresses the reader with the originality it may really pos - sess .

		One is apt to fight shy of such books .

		It is true that this is an age of potted litera - ture , but even at the present day there are not a few for whom potted literature has very slight attractions .

		By the peculiar character of her work
Miss Repplier	PERSON	runs the risk of losing the attention of many who would be interested in the good qualities that her writings undoubt - edly possess .

		For when we say that '' Essays in Idleness '' are Miss Repplier 's usual combinations of quo - tation and comment , we have by no means said the last word on the matter .

		That fact being once accepted , one is free to find in the book a certain sort of work , exquisite of its kind , and of a kind that rightly pleases many cultivated people .

		It may be that Miss Repplier is con - sciously a follower of Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	.

		Con - sciously or not , she is , as an artist , of a char - acter somewhat akin to that sketched by the ineffable
Gilbert	PERSON	, as he passed in an irridescent mist of words from his chambertin and orta - * ESSAYS IN IDLENESS .

		Other authors write about life and such things .

		Miss Elepplier writes about -LRB- and around -RRB- what others lave written .

		She treats of all subjects , while involved in a sort of cloud of what other peo - ple have said on the matter .

		One gets from tier book no echo of the world , only echoes from the world of letters .

		On the foundations of what she has read she uplifts new structures of her own , and the remarkable thing is that these new structures are not wanting in grace and beauty .

		A somewhat individual gift this : it is worth while to remark it and appreciate it .

		It will not do to set Miss Repplier down as merely a clever woman who has read much .

		Her cleverness is of a peculiar type , and her work has its own excellences .

		In the present volume , the first essay is the most charming .

		It is about Miss Repplier 's cat .

		Cats and men of letters seem to be the two things that stimulate Miss Repplier 's gen - ius .

		For this essay -LRB- besides providing us with the opinions concerning cats , and other things , of Saint Beuve , M. Fee ,

		It is worth while giving a few examples of them , although it is not easy to give the true quality of such a book by a few extracts .

		The real character is in the gen - eral toning rather than in any separate remark . ''

		Rude and masterful souls resent this fine self-suffi - ciency in a domestic animal , and require that it should have no will but theirs , no pleasure that does not ema - nate from them .

		They are forever prating of the love and fidelity of the dog , of the beast that obeys their slight - est word , crouches contentedly for hours at their feet , is exuberately grateful for the smallest attention , and so affectionate that its demonstrations require to be curbed rather than encouraged .

		All this homage is pleasing to their vanity ; yet there are people , less magisterial per - haps , or less exacting , who believe that true friendship , even with an animal , may be built upon mutual esteem and independance ; that to demand gratitude is to be unworthy of it ; and that obedience is not essential to agreeable and healthy intercourse ... ' My dog fetches my supper for me every night , ' said a friend triumph - antly , not long ago ... < Would your cat do as much for you , I 'd like to know ? '

		Assuredly not !

		If I waited for Agrippina to fetch me shoes or slippers , I should have no other resource save to join as speedily , as possible one of the barefooted religious orders of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But , after all , fetching slippers is not the whole duty of domestic pets ... Agrippina will never make herself serviceable .

		Yet nevertheless is she of inesti - 226 THE DIAL -LSB-

Agrippina	LOCATION	is always beautiful ; and it is better to be beautiful than to fetch and carry from the rising to the setting of the sun ...
Schopenhauer	PERSON	has said that the reason domestic pets are so lovable and so helpful to us is because they enjoy , quietly and placidly , the present moment ... Life holds no fu - ture for them and consequently no care ; if they are content , their contentment is absolute ; and our jaded and wearied spirits find a natural relief in the sight of creatures whose little cups of happiness can so easily be filled to the brim ... Oh , you who strive to relieve your overwrought nerves , and cultivate power through repose , watch the exquisite languor of a drowsy cat , and despair of imitating such perfect and restful grace .

EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* ''
David Balfour	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's new novel , is a sequel to '' Kidnapped , '' but suffers less than do most sequels from comparison with their predeces - sors .

		The years that separate the two divisions of the romance have brought to the author a more compact and highly-wrought style , and do not seem to have impaired his powers of invention .

		Alan Breck appears from time to time in the course of the narrative , but
David	PERSON	is the real hero , and the story at last finds a heroine in the altogether ador - able Catriona .

		Those who have missed the ewig - weibliche from Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's books will have no cause for complaint this time , for ''
David Balfour	PERSON	'' is a story of love as well as of adventure .

		The Scots vocabulary makes the book rather troublesome reading ; and one gets a little weary of the gram - matical mannerisms the progressive presents and future perfects of its speech .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's realism is a little too uncompromising in these re - spects .

		But the principal characters are certainly triumphs of delineation ;
David	PERSON	and Catriona ,
James More	PERSON	and the
Lord Advocate	ORGANIZATION	, are firmly and con - sistently drawn .

		him the re-reading of the earlier romance although he might do worse than that .

		In writing '' The Rebel Queen , '' Mr.
Besant	PERSON	evi - dently had two objects in view : to exalt the He - brew , and to maintain the thesis that a wife should obey , as well as love and honor , her husband .

		The first of these objects he has sought to accomplish by an appeal to the historic sense and to the streak of mysticism found in most minds .

		Where
George Eliot	PERSON	failed Mr.
Besant	PERSON	could hardly hope to suc - ceed ; and the Wandering Jew of his narrative , although a finely conceived and impressive figure , does not seem to be a typical embodiment of his race , and does not quite persuade us of the posses - sion , by that race in general , of an undue share in the moral and intellectual energies of mankind .

		The persistence of the type is the really striking fact about the Hebrew , and Mr.
Besant	PERSON	brings that out very clearly .

		As for the author 's success in his sec - ond aim , we will not venture upon an opinion .

		He will doubtless hear from his feminine readers in outspoken and unequivocal protest upon that sub - ject .

		The Cause of Woman finds many amazons in these latter days , and they will not miss so ex - cellent an opportunity for a skirmish .

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's story is , taken simply as a story , varied in interest and extremely entertaining .

		But it has been too easily written to have any lasting value .

		`` The Prince of
India	LOCATION	'' has been heralded for some time by the newspapers , and the methods em - ployed have been not unlike those made familiar to newspaper readers by the enterprise of theatrical advance-agents .

		Descriptions of the plot , anecdotes of the writer , and curiosity-provoking extracts from the text , have all taken their turn , and had their share in preparing the newspaper-reading mind for the advent of the great work .

		We have even been told that President
Garfield	PERSON	, in sending the author to
Constantinople	LOCATION	as American minister , had for his real object the provision of leisure and oppor - tunity for the preparation of a historical romance .

		That romance has now appeared , and its two thick volumes are at least a monument to the author 's industry .

		The essence of the story may be briefly set forth .

		Our old friend , the Wandering Jew , who has done such veteran service to poets and novelists , is once more brought to light , and , in the character of a mediaeval
Monte Cristo	ORGANIZATION	, is represented as seek - ing to organize a
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	in fif - teenth century
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		First seeking the support of the Greek emperor for his project , but failing to secure it , he has recourse to the Turk , and urges the young Mohammed on to the conquest of the capital .

		This plot is , of course , except for the actual historical episode of the conquest , too unreal to be very impressive ; at least ,
General Wallace	ORGANIZATION	is far from having the imaginative power necessary to make it impressive .

		The Wandering Jew comes to be very tiresome after a while , and the reader soon learns to skip his interminable harangues upon religious unity .

		His argument for a universal faith 1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 has a curiously nineteenth century fin de si & cle fla - vor ; it goes without saying that such an argument could by no possibility have been formulated by the Wandering Jew or anybody else , at the time of the narrative .

		But the Wandering Jew and his religious hobby are not , after all , the chief elements of interest in the work , and when we have set them aside there remains a historical romance of consid - erable interest and constructive skill .

		There is no doubt that the writer has made a careful study of the period , and actual observation has given vivid - ness to many of his descriptions .

		We do not sup - pose that his book will bear the minuter tests of historical scholarship , but neither will the romances of
Scott	LOCATION	, or of
Kingsley	PERSON	, or of
Lord Lytton	ORGANIZATION	.

		It doubtless comes as near to historical accuracy as '' Ivanhoe , '' or '' Hypatia , '' or '' The Last of the Barons . ''

		The interest of the narrative is fairly sustained , and is worked up to a proper climax in the story of the siege of
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		As for the style , it is well , it is what readers of '' Ben-Hur '' might have expected .

		The less closely it is exam - ined , the better satisfied will its readers be .

		We have no doubt that the book will prove popular , for the average reader cares nothing for style ; that it will ever rank as literature may be confidently denied .

		`` Not Angels Quite '' is the incomprehensible title of a molluscous narrative that is neither witty , wise , nor well-written , although it clearly aims to be all three .

		The story , as far as there is one , is that of Goethe 's '' Wahlverwandtschaften , '' but lowered to the level of comedy , and utterly devoid of human interest .

		But the writer can hardly have expected his lay figures to be taken as real characters ; they serve merely as a framework for his superstructure of dull realism , for his small-beer chronicle of the doings of a few eccentric Bostonians , given over to all manner of '' fads . ''

		Anything more incoherent than this jumble of empty discussions , inapt quota - tions , and attempts at humor , is not often met with between the covers of a book .

		The style , with its self-consciousness and its affectations , is simply in - tolerable .

		One takes up '' The Complaining Millions of Men '' with the notion that he is embarking upon the dangerous sea of socialist tendenz-ftction .

		; but he is quickly undeceived .

		The hero is , indeed , a sort of socialist , and is first introduced to us as a haranguer of labor gatherings ; but the socialism which he and his fellows represent is drawn in such caricature that it can not be considered a serious study .

		This hero , who is a Hungarian of uncer - tain origin , and who is '' taken up '' as a sort of fad by
Boston	LOCATION	society , speedily developes into a brute of the most unmitigated sort , whose conduct is too repulsive to be even interesting for any consider - able length .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has evidently set out to be a realist ; and unrelieved tedium is , for the most part , the reward of his readers .

		In one respect he has carried realism to an unjustifiable extent .

		A number of well-known persons , mostly writers , fig - ure in his pages , their actual names being very thinly disguised .

		The taste of this procedure is always questionable , and when it goes so far , in one of the present instances , as to insinuate a lack of personal cleanliness on the part of a certain character of whose identity no one will remain in doubt it be - comes simply intolerable .

		This is the worst offence chargeable to the writer , although others are not wanting .

		The story , which is told at great length , is essentially improbable , although to a certain ex - tent probably based upon an actual
Boston	LOCATION	scandal of a few years past .

		It is a far cry from '' The
Chevalier	PERSON	of
Pensieri	LOCATION	- Vani '' to `` The Cliff - Dwellers . ''

		Mr.
Henry Ful	PERSON	- ler 's new novel entertains us with no record of sentimental journeyings among the mountains and the monuments of the Old World , but gives us instead an alert and unsentimental depiction of everyday life in the newest great city of the
New World	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to note how completely the writer has freed himself from a manner which , although at first charming in its graceful languor , was fast becoming a mannerism .

		The vein was near the point of exhaustion , and was wisely aban - doned when it had yielded its best ore .

		Mr.
Ful	PERSON	- ler 's `` cliff-dwellers '' are the people who live and move and have much of their being in one of the many-storied office buildings of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The metaphor of the title is original and pleasing , al - though possibly a little too elaborately worked out in the introductory pages .

		When we come to the substance of the story , it is found to consist in a series of very realistic episodes in the lives of half a dozen men of affairs , relieved by a few equally realistic domestic passages , and given continuity and coherence by their relation to the fortunes of one central figure , that of the unheroic young man who serves for a hero .

		The heroine of the story is not so easily singled out .

		Both of the successive wives of the hero have claims to that distinction , and so has Miss
Cornelia McNabb	PERSON	, who comes from
Pewaukee	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	bent upon conquests matrimonial and social ; but we are , on the whole , inclined to regard as the real heroine the pervasive but almost mythical
Cecilia Ingles	PERSON	, who , without entering upon the scene , so constantly piques our curiosity , and of whose personal appearance we should have no notion had not the artist made up for the neglect of the narrator .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's chief types the banker , the banker 's son , the real estate speculator , the Western representative of an East - ern house , and the young man whose fortunes most engage the reader are absolutely truthful ; the uncompromising actuality of their delineation will cause many a reader to wince , but he must at the same time confess to the accuracy of the portrait - ure .

		At first sight , Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's study , although minute , appears merely superficial , but a closer ex - amination shows that he has insight as well as the observant faculty .

		We come , for example , upon quiet incisive characterizations of
Chicago	LOCATION	that say 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, much in few words .

		`` He seemed to see before him the spokesman of a community where pros - perity had drugged patriotism into unconsciousness .

		and where the bare scaffoldings of materialism felt themselves quite independent of the graces and draperies of culture . ''

		`` To the Chicagoan , the name of the town , in its formal , ceremonial use , has a power that no other word in the language quite possesses .

		It is a shibboleth , as regards its pronunciation ; it is a trumpet-call , as regards its effect . ''

		We quote almost at random these two bits of criticism ; there are many others equally searching .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	appears to be one of the few people who can judge with objective fairness of the community in which their lives have been spent .

		His book seems to us to have no less value as a document than interest as a story . ''

		The Tutor 's Secret '' is one of those sane and temperate works of fiction that come from time to time , in refutation of the popular prejudice that French novelists are all repulsive realists or morbid sensualists .


M. Cherbuliez	PERSON	has taken a simple and familiar theme that of the family tutor in love with the young woman whom he is charged to in - struct ; but his treatment is so fresh , so brilliant , and so sympathetic , that he makes of his theme a new story .

		The outcome of the situation is neither violence nor despair one of which would surely have been given us by a writer with leanings to - wards sensationalism , but a chastened and phil - osophical acceptance of the inevitable .

		The char - acters are drawn with perfect fidelity to life ; they speak and act in perfectly natural ways , and stand out in distinct relief .

		They are not types , but in - dividuals , and their human interest is very manifest .

		Situations which would be a trifle risqu6 in the hands of most writers receive a sober treatment de - void of the least offence , and the story , although nowhere obtrusively didactic , has very evident bear - ings upon the conduct of life .

		We notice one cu - rious inadvertence .

		Among the books read by the fair pupil-heroine , is one entitled '' The Destiny of Man , Read by the Light of His Origin . ''

		It should be '' viewed in , '' not '' read by , '' but that is not the point .

		It is a little curious to find the author thus characterized : '' He is a theologian , and the trail of the serpent is plain . ''

		Possibly Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	is not altogether undeserving of this treatment , but it is likely to surprise him .

		The idiosyncrasy of the collector is one , although the mania may pursue many objects .

		In the story of '' The Faience Violin '' the object is pottery , prob - ably as potent to harden the heart as old books , or tulips , or postage stamps .

		This humorous study in moral pathology is the work of the late
Jules Fleury	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Champfleury -RRB- , who had the knowledge of an ex - pert in keramics and the wit of a Frenchman of let - ters .

		It is a very charming bit of work , and Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	, who has turned it into the most flexible and idiomatic of English , was well advised in offering it to the public of another than its original speech .

		One of the three stories in Mr.
James	PERSON	's new volume ''
Lord Beaupre	PERSON	'' '' follows the lines of normal human activity ; the two others are whim - sical in the extreme , if not actually morbid . ''

		The Visits , '' slighter than the others , is a tragic study of an unbalanced temperament , and is even more inconclusive than most of the author 's stories .

		The charm of '' The Private Life , '' although hope - lessly elusive , is not without a certain power of fascination .

		It must be taken , if at all seriously , as a sort of allegorical study of the problem of personality .

		One type of character represented in this story by
Lord Mellif	PERSON	ont exists only for the .

		public , lives and moves and has its being in the appreciation or applause of its fellows .

		The au - thor whimsically suggests that such a character has no '' private life '' at all , that it is but a sort of plausible simulacrum , vanishing when the audience dissolves , reemerging from its limbo with the ap - pearance of some one -LRB- may we say some one else ? -RRB-

		upon the scene .

		Its very existence is not a reality , but a mere reaction .

		Contrasted with this type is the other embodied in
Claude Vawdrey	PERSON	, with whom the `` private life '' is the real one , whose personal - ity as displayed to the world is only a faint projec - tion from the real inner self perhaps what the theosophists would call an astral body .

		The delin - eation of these two types is very ingenious , and the author contrives , by many subtle touches , to invest his fanciful thesis with something of verisimilitude .

		But the allegory lurks beneath , and his readers can never quite forget that .

		Mr.
Hibbard	PERSON	's new volume of short stories em - phasizes that writer 's claims to a high rank among those who practice the art of fiction in this special field .

		His work approaches the best French models in its appreciation of the limitations imposed by hia chosen form , in its sense of the episode , and in its constructive skill . ''

		Nowadays , '' the titular story , is a minor masterpiece , marred only by a slight af - fectation in the use of its title as a catch-word . ''

		There 's Nothing Half so Sweet in Life '' and '' A Mad World , My Masters '' are also admirable .

		These stories are based upon the '' psychological mo - ment , '' selected with rare discrimination , and dwelt upon just long enough to keep interest at its height .

		* ' Guilty Sir Guy '' is a ghost-story of the
Stockton	PERSON	- ian type , amusing but not impressive .

		The two remaining stories are a trifle less successful .

		We may say at once of these essays that , while they merit reprinting , they lack the en - gaging personal note and spontaneity of the letters , and their style is at times singularly involved .

		The paper on Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	is a good speci - men of the biographical review , chatty , and full of illustrative , well-ordered facts .

		Reynolds 's unhappy excursions into the '' grand style '' of painting are severely dealt with : '' In the highest subjects of all , his failure was the most signal .

		Of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	window , our only intuition is , that it is abominable in theory , in conception , in style .

		The lubberly angel above , the smirking faces below , the vapid rows of Virtues between the mullions , scarcely higher in invention than those blindfold white women with scales , idiotic Hopes with anchors , which support the dignity of a ' Perpetual Grand Master ' of the Order of Odd Fellows , on his engraved diploma , are all bad together . ''

		The essay on
William Blake	PERSON	a genius with whom Smethan himself had much in common is a rather notable production , and was appended in part to
Gilchrist	PERSON	and Ros - setti 's
Life of Blake	ORGANIZATION	.

		Touching the dispute as to
Blake	PERSON	's sanity , the author is of opinion that he was , at least , '' slightly touched . ''

		A curious semi - mechanical explanation is offered of
Blake	PERSON	's boyish vision of '' a tree filled with angels '' his report of which at home , by the way , nearly earned him a thrashing at the hands of his prosaic and truth-lov - ing father .

		First picturing the lad as resting '' among the orchai ` ds '' after a tramp over the
Surrey	LOCATION	hills , the author continues : '' Here he pauses , leans over a gate , looks at a large blossom-loaded tree in which the threads of sunlight are entangled like gossamers , which ' twinkle into green and gold . '

		A zephyr stirs the cloud of sun-stricken bloom , where white commingled with sparkling red flushes over leaves of emerald .

		Tears of delight ' rise from his heart and gather to his eyes ' as he gazes on it .

		The rays which kindle the blossoms turn his gathered tears to prisms ... The impressible brain , already filled with thoughts of the ' might of stars and angels , ' kindles suddenly into a dream-like creative energy , and the sunny orchard becomes a Mahanaim , even to his outward eye . ''

		In the paper on
Gerhard Dow	ORGANIZATION	,
Smetham	PERSON	shows that , despite his own ideal - ism , he could appreciate the home-keeping genius of the '' rubbishing Dutchmen . ''

		The
Arena Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue , in a neat vol - ume of 375 pages , a life of
Albert Brisbane	PERSON	, the
American Fourierist	ORGANIZATION	and reformer , by his wife ,
Redelia Brisbane	PERSON	.

		The body of the book was taken partly from Mr.
Bris	PERSON	- bane 's dictation and partly from his journal , and the author has added a `` Character Study '' which is chiefly remarkable as a pathetic instance of the futility of the personal estimate .

		The subject of the biography was a prominent figure about 1840 The biography of an
American Fourierist	ORGANIZATION	.

		an era of social and religious ferment .

		He was the pioneer and chief exponent in this country of Four - ierism ; and to his efforts were largely due the thirty-four American Fourieristic experiments -LRB- as enumerated by Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	-RRB- , the most noteworthy of which was '' Brook Farm . ''


Horace Greeley	PERSON	was one of his converts ; and
Ripley	PERSON	,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	,
Channing	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and others , were probably more or less affected by his doctrines .

		Brisbane was a gifted speaker though perhaps a little in the style of the `` tedious archangel '' of
Concord	LOCATION	; indeed ,
Robert Owen	PERSON	once called him ``
America	LOCATION	's first orator . ''

		He was a singularly pure , high-minded , and withal un-practical man ; and like so many of his type , he knew little of and cared little for the elements of the society he proposed to regenerate .

		As our author says , '' his very mental constitution rendered it impossible for him ever to attain to a commonplace , common-sense apprecia - tion of the matter-of-fact world '' than which no - thing more need be said to assure the reader of the practical fruitlessness of Mr.
Brisbane	PERSON	's well-meant apostolate .

		The volume has an element of interest for the general reader in its anecdotes and sketches of eminent people , including
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	, Men - delssohn , V. Cousin ,
Hegel	PERSON	,
Fourier	PERSON	,
Arthur Young	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Clay	ORGANIZATION	,
Seward	LOCATION	, Garrison , and others .

		Mr.
Brisbane	PERSON	saw Goethe shortly before the poet 's death : '' His appearance was impressive .

		Though age had dimmed the eye and rendered the voice tremulous , the firm head was still well-poised , and the finely-cut features preserved traces of past beauty .

		Never - theless , it was evident that the equilibrium of the intellect had to be maintained with great care .

		I could see that the spirit trembled in its cerebral home , ready at any moment to take its flight .

		He spoke slowly , following with difficulty his trains of thought ; and the most that I retain of that inter - view was a remark that he made on the tendency of the human mind to accept those theories which are most congenial to the individual character . ''

		Heine , says Mr.
Brisbane	PERSON	, `` was a man of small stature , thin and wiry , but compactly built ; a swarthy face , the blackest of black hair , and small black eyes which seemed animated with one pene - trating glow of sarcasm .

		There was an intensity in his regard which impressed one peculiarly , as if the eye alone , in which beamed a soul on fire , con - stituted the man .

		... It would seem as if he were internally at work tearing to pieces every subject presented to him , and dissecting every idea that crossed his mind .

		... I liked
Heine	PERSON	very much .

		He seemed an earnest thinker at the bottom , be - neath all his sarcasm , and one endeavoring to ar - rive at the truth . ''

		There are two portraits in the volume .

Thackeray	PERSON	out of his narrative altogether for the great novelist certainly does flit through it in a spectral '' Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	'' sort of fashion .

		The book , however , though amusing enough in itself , is scarcely what its title leads one to expect , a real addition to
Thackerayana	LOCATION	.

		It is essentially the -LRB- largely pic - torial -RRB- record of the American impressions of its author , who , in
1852	DATE	, accompanied
Thackeray	PERSON	as his amanuensis on his American lecturing tour .

		While the text is confessedly written up to the pictures , it is usually bright and pungent , and contains some amusing anecdotes .

		During a visit to the
Harper	PERSON	's establishment ,
Thackeray	PERSON	took occasion to ask '' Whose name stood foremost in popularity in book sales in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He -LSB- Mr.
James Har	PERSON	- per -RSB- took down a ponderous ledger , turned up the leaves at letter J , and said , '
George Payne Rains	PERSON	- ford
James	PERSON	heads the list , far ahead of any other author , as you can judge for yourself by glancing at the number of his books sold .

		He turns out a novel every six months , and the success is always the same , and tremendous . ' ''

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	explained this astonishing vogue by saying , '' The main reason is that his romances can always be safely placed upon the family table , with the certainty that no page will sully or call the blush to the cheek of any member of the household '' a reply more flatter - ing , perhaps , to Mr.
James	PERSON	's pages than to the men - tal tendencies of those for whom they were sup - posed to be such eminently `` safe '' reading .

		Mr.
Coote	PERSON	records that this chaste romancer , then Brit - ish Consul at
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	, was compelled , owing to his anti-slavery views , to exchange his post for
Venice	LOCATION	'' the only place , '' he adds with some hu - mor , '' where he could not descry two muffled cav - aliers ascending a hill on horseback . ''

		The numer - ous pen-sketches form interesting records of Amer - ican men , cities , and manners of forty years ago .

La Valliere	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Like its predecessors , the book is full of court glitter and romance .

		We have followed
M. Saint-Amand	PERSON	's series of brilliant historical pictures with much in - terest , though not without regret that the current of his sympathies should be , as we think , so constantly misdirected .

		Inspired by his royalist leanings and his taste for the material pomp and stately tradi - tions of the Old Regime , he casts a glamour of ro - mance and a tinge of sentiment about a class that , at the period treated , existed solely by preying upon the life of the French nation .

		He is touched by the
April	DATE	sorrows and humors of the Sun King 's titled Cyprians ; for the life-long misery of
Jacques Bon	ORGANIZATION	- homme , who paid with tears and toil for the splen - dors of the shameful
Versailles Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, he has scarcely a passing word .

		M. Saint-Amand has , of course , the right to choose his historical province and his point of view ; but it is well to qualify the impressions he gives us by turning , for instance , to La Bruyere 's pictures of the wretched French peas - antry a class robbed alike by the Crown , the Church , and the Seigneurs , slaves of the soil at which they toiled with such indomitable patience , .

Candace Wheeler	PERSON	.

		Of the eight essays , by as many differ - ent women , which compose the first-named book , all except two here make their first appearance in print , though all are written with evident knowl - edge of and enthusiasm for kindergarten work .

		The subject is treated rather in its lai ` ger relations to life than in its methods and technicalities , the best being '' The Relation of the Kindergarten to Social Reform '' by the editor , and '' Outgrowths of Kin - dergarten Training '' by Mrs.
A. B. Longstreet	PERSON	.

		The collection of essays on '' Household Art `` is an admirable one , though all have previously appeared in magazines except the concluding one by the edi - tor , read before the recent Art
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the Co - lumbian Exposition .

		Three of the essays contain valuable material for a history of American art as applied to the household , namely , '' The Develop - ment of American Homes '' by Mrs.
Rensselaer	PERSON	, '' Some Work of the < Associated Artists ' '' by Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	, and '' The Progress of American Decorative Art '' by
Mary Gay Humphreys	PERSON	.

		When an old favorite appears in a new form , especially if attended `` with additions , '' a certain amount of question and distrust arises .

		These newcomers can it be that they are quite as good as the old friends ?

		or is it not probable that what has been done once con amore will lose somewhat of its flavor when duplicated to order ?

		Such thoughts will be likely to occur to the lovers of
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Letters to Dead Authors '' on the announcement of a new edition by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, with four additional let - ters .

		But all doubts vanish with the reading .

		The new quartette letters to
John Knox	PERSON	,
Increase Mather	ORGANIZATION	, Homer , and Mr.
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	are in every way worthy of the companionship in which they are placed .

		Indeed , perhaps there is nothing better , either old or new , in the volume than the letter to Homer .

		After all the learned treatises on the authorship of
Homer	LOCATION	, after all that has been written , pro and con , in regard to the man Homer and the poems which bear his name , it is no small glory to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	that , in his own confidential and sympathetic though half playful way , he manages to offer one of the strongest and most eloquent of appeals for the single authorship of these poems , and impress the conviction that '' there is a poet in the poems , as there is a God in the world .

		NEW YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Oct. 10 , 1893	DATE	.

		.

		Memories of thirty years syne , of literary
New York	LOCATION	in war times , are recalled by the arrival at a famous - artistic and literary club in this city of the four thous - and volumes which comprise the late
James Lorimer Graham	PERSON	's library .

		I shall attempt , further on , to con - vey some idea of the value of this bequest , now fulfilled seventeen years after the owner 's death ; but the chief interest of these books will always centre in Mr.
Gra	PERSON	- ham 's personality and in the associations which gather around his name .

		The old group of
New York	LOCATION	men of letters , repre - sented by
Bryant	PERSON	,
Willis	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	, and
Tuckerman	PERSON	, bad held the field , both social and literary , for many years before the outbreak of the Civil War .

		Younger writ - ers , in the intervals of newspaper work or business of the most exacting kind , managed to get together in a semi Bohemian way .

		Their contributions to literature were largely restricted , however , to the columns of various free-lance journals , such as the ''
Saturday	DATE	Press , '' the `` Round Table , '' and the `` Albion . ''

		Social recognition was a missing quantity .

		Of course , I da not mean recognition by fashionable society , then as now a shining mark for wits and satirists , but I refer to those more agreeable circles where the spirit of art prevailed .

		In these circles
James Lorimer Graham	PERSON	had moved for a number of years , at the time I have
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 in mind .

		He came of a cultured family , and he was made independent by his marriage to Miss
Josephine Garner	PERSON	, a
New York	LOCATION	belle of the day , whose relatives are wealthy people still .

		It was
Willard Fiske	PERSON	, I be - lieve , who first brought
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	to Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's home in
Washington Square	LOCATION	.

		Its occupant already had gained reputation as a book collector , at a time when the art of book collecting in this country was in its infancy .

		A well-selected picture gallery added to the attractions of a house whose every guest felt that he was
Lorry Graham	PERSON	's particular friend .

		One after an - other , the group of authors and artists to which Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	belonged found their way to
Graham	PERSON	's doors , and a social centre for the younger men was formed , the influences of which are felt to this day .

		Of all these friendships , that between the Grahams and
Richard	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Stoddard	PERSON	was probably the most intimate ; but
Taylor	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Winter	DATE	,
Godkin	PERSON	,
O. P. Cranch	PERSON	, Ho wells and
Boker	PERSON	when in town , the artists
Kensett	PERSON	,
McEntee	PERSON	,
Hicks	PERSON	,
Bierstadt	PERSON	, and
Launt Thompson	PERSON	, and their families , all frequented the
Gra	ORGANIZATION	- hams ' .

		Most of these gentlemen sooner or later became members of the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, and this was a further bond of union between them .

		In
1866	DATE	Mr. and Mrs.
Graham	PERSON	removed their home to
Florence	LOCATION	, where the former assumed the duties of
United States	LOCATION	consul .

		His departure was made the occasion of a memorable dinner , given by his friends and comrades , with poems and speeches galore .

		This event was impressed very thoroughly on the memory of one very small boy , by Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's coming to our house the next morning and making a final effort to adopt him , the Grahams having no children of their own .

		But even the display of a great bag of imitation coins -LRB- some advertising device -RRB- was ineffectual , although the small boy 's eyes were dazzled .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	re - mained at
Florence	LOCATION	until his death in
1876	DATE	, and became as noted for his hospitality there as in this country .

		Thackeray ,
Sala	LOCATION	,
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Longfel	PERSON	- low , and many others , were his guests at either place , and his books are enriched with their inscriptions .

		Besides these personal gifts his library contains a large number of volumes bearing the autographs of other distinguished writers .

		There are also quantities of first editions , early printed books , standard editions of the classics of many languages , and bound volumes of val - uable prints , portraits , and autographs , which represent many years of careful searching on the part of Mr.
Graham	PERSON	.

		And now that his wife has died , the books have come to keep his memory green in the club which he loved so well .

		It was
Swinburne	PERSON	who wrote at his '' Not a kindlier life or sweeter Time , that lights and quenches men , Now may quench or light again , Mingling with the mystic metre Woven of all men 's lives with his Not a clearer note than this , Not a kindlier life or sweeter . ''

		Preparations are being made for a formal commem - oration of the death of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, to be given at the
Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	,
Madison Square Garden	ORGANIZATION	, on
November 13	DATE	, the sixtieth anniversary of Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's birth .

		The ex - ercises are to be of an elaborate and impressive char - acter .

		Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	is expected to preside .

		Prof.
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	will deliver an ode , and Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, whose eloquent words commemorating Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	still linger in the memory , will deliver the address .

		At intervals Shakespearian music will be rendered by Mr.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	and his orchestra .

		The proceedings are to be in charge of a committee of the
Players Club	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mr.
William Bispham	PERSON	, Booth 's most intimate friend , is chairman .

		The Play - ers , it will be remembered , was founded by Mr.
Booth	PERSON	, who presented to the club its home and many of his most precious relics .

		The latter are displayed behind glass in fire-proof safes , arranged to be open in the daytime .

		No doubt Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	will be an honored guest of the occasion .

		He has just returned from a long sojourn in
California	LOCATION	, and is now busily occupied in seeing through the press his '' Life and Art of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	. ''

		This work , I hear , will contain six - teen full-page plates of the actor in different characters , besides many other illustrations .

		A limited edition is also to be published on handmade paper .

		I have been interested to observe the quick success of the neat - looking series of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's works published by
Macniillau & Co.	ORGANIZATION	during the past two years .

		Thirty thousand of these little volumes were sold
last fall	DATE	, and their popularity is not by any means on the wane .

		That Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's exquisite poetry and prose should at last be published in a commercially available form is a matter of gratification .

		They are none the less sensate with the spirit of his native land because they respond harmoniously to the song and tradition of
Old England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	has come back from his Eu - ropean trip in fine health and spirits .

		He has nearly completed his opera founded upon
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Scar - let Letter , '' for which Mr.
George Parsons Lathrop	PERSON	has supplied the libretto .

		Probably one act will be ren - dered as a concert piece in
December	DATE	, but the stage - production will not take place until next season .

		Students of American music may like to know that Mr.
Damrosch	PERSON	, after persistent questioning , admitted that there is none of that negro melody upon which Dr.
Dvorak	PERSON	has recently based such high expectations .

		LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		A new novel by
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	, `` Julian der Ab - triinnige , '' is to appear in
October	DATE	.

		It will be remem - bered that Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	has treated this subject dramat - ically in his '' Emperor and Galilsean . ''

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just begun publica - tion , in a new edition , of the great work of
Thiers	PERSON	, the '' History of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and the Empire of
France	LOCATION	under Napoleon the First , '' in the authorized transla - tion of Mr.
D. Forbes Campbell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edward J. Harding	PERSON	, for two years past the lit - erary editor of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' has retired from that position and accepted a business engagement which will fix his future residence in
Biltmore	LOCATION	,
North Caro	LOCATION	- lina , a lovely and healthful region .

		Mr.
Harding	PERSON	's work represented the highest grade of newspaper criticism , and his retirement is hence a distinct loss to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

Alexander B. Grosart	PERSON	rejoices in the possession of the identical copy of

Cowper	PERSON	, 8 vols. , vol .

		III. , pp. 383-4 -RRB- .

		The acquisition of this interest - ino - relic by Dr.

September	DATE	.

		This note is a 234 THE DIAL -LSB-

Paris	LOCATION	bookstall
J. J. Rousseau	PERSON	's copy of the `` Imitatione Christi . ''

		The first number of the new '' Psychological Review '' will be published early in
1894	DATE	, by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be edited by Professor
James Mark Baldwin	PERSON	, of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, with the collabora - tion of Professors
Cattell	PERSON	,
Dewey	LOCATION	,
Donaldson	ORGANIZATION	, Fuller - ton ,
James	PERSON	,
Ladd	PERSON	, and
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, and of
M. Alfred Binet	PERSON	.

		These names afford a sufficient guarantee of the scientific and progressive character of the new un - dertaking , and yet they do not indicate too exclusive a leaning to the new psychology of the laboratory .

		Pub - lication will , we understand , be bi-monthly .

		We quote the following editorial note from the Lon - don '' Literary World . ''

		Is it a joke ? ''


Hans Breit	PERSON	- mann , besides giving a certain historic ' barty , ' has found time for adventures varied enough to make his forth - coming memoirs most interesting .

		He was one of the Knickerbockers , but abandoned journalism for original literary work .

		Then he became an educational re - former , and not till comparatively late in life did he find his real vocation as a poet .

		His poetical works are being prepared for publication in the following order : ' The Book of Songs , ' New Poems , '
Atta Troll	PERSON	, Ger - many , and Romancers , ' and ' Last Poems . ' '' ''

		Popular Astronomy '' is the title of a new scientific monthly for which we bespeak a welcome .

		It is edited by Professor
W. W. Payne	PERSON	, of
Northfield	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, who conducted '' The Sidereal Messenger '' for the ten years of its existence , and who , with the assistance of Professor
George E. Hale	PERSON	, has edited '' Astronomy and Astro-Physics '' for the past two years .

		The new mag - azine is designed to interest amateurs and students , and the number just issued contains articles by the best En - glish and American writers , as well as a number of at - tractive illustrations .

		The periodical should find a place in every high school and college of the country , as well as in the library of every family of young people .

		An '' Athenseum '' reviewer has the following clearly personal note on Rossetti : '' To say that any artist could take a deeper interest in the work of a friend than in his own seems bold , yet it could be said of
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		The mean rivalries of the literary character , that so often make men experienced in the world shrink away from it , found no place in that great heart .

		To hear him recite in his musical voice the sonnet or lyric of some unknown bard or bardling recite it in such a way as to lend the lines the light and music of his own marvellous genius , while the bard or bardling listened with head bowed low , so that the flush on his cheek and the moisture in his eye should not be seen this was an experience that did indeed make the bardic life ' worth living . ' ''

		THE `` WESTERN SCHOOL '' OF LITERATURE : AN EASTERN COMMENT .

		THE DIAL is glad to find its recent utterance on the subject of '' The Literary West '' commended by so ex - cellent an authority as the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' which says : '' There has been of late a general outbreak , in magazines and newspapers , of articles about culture and literature in the West , all of them prophesying , and some of them professing to have discovered , a new literary school in and about
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		This is variously described , but the one mark upon which all the critics and prophets agree is that the literature of the West is to be absolutely novel and original .

		It is to cut loose entirely from forms and standards prevalent in the
East	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	, and it is at last to give the genu - ine American ' a voice . '

		After all this churning up of foam it is a relief to turn to the words of truth and so - berness spoken by the
Chicago	LOCATION	DIAL .

		With the great - est good sense it remarks : '' ' It is time to have done with the notion , forced upon us with wearisome iteration by certain writers , both
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western , that the West is now developing , or ever will de - velop , a distinctive literature of its own .

		The West and the
East	LOCATION	are peopled by the same sort of men and women , and their work , when it deserves the name of literature at all , has , and will have , the characteristics common to all good writing in the English language .

		The distinction between East and West will never be other than an artificial one ; even now many of the best writers of either section came to it from the other .

		If the national centre of literary activity follows the westward path of the centre of population , as seems probable , it will carry with it the accepted literary tra - dition , before which all crude local growths of tradition will be forced to give way .

		The coming literature of the West may be largely Western in its themes , but it will never be Western in its manner , as certain blatant rhetoricians would persuade us . ' ''

		That states the case in a way to leave nothing to be added , and we could wish that there were more such signs of sanity discernible , East or West . ''

		EMERSON 'S FRIENDSHIPS THE IDEAL AND THE REAL .

		`` What is so pleasant as these friendships , which make a young world for me again ?

		What so deli - cious as a just and firm encounter of two , in a thought , in a feeling ?

		How beautiful the approach to us of the steps and forms of the gifted and the true !

		I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends .

		I chide society , I embrace solitude , and yet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise , the lovely , and the noble-minded , as from time to time they pass my gate . ''

		Emerson , Essay on Friendship . ''

		A few years ago , shortly after the death of Emer - son , an English visitor to the philosophic village of
Concord	LOCATION	was being shown the
Emerson	LOCATION	mansion by a native who was not a philosopher . '

		This , ' said the guide , ' is the garden Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	was so fond of tend - ing ; this is the path leading to his orchard - walk ; this is the window out of which he used to climb when he saw Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	walking up to the front door at the op - posite side of the house . ''

		English Review .

		A RARE COPY OF
WALTON	PERSON	'S ANGLER .

		A decided rarity in the old-book line has lately been imported to this country , and a gentleman at
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, is the fortunate possessor thereof .

		For over two years the
Taylor-Austin Co.	ORGANIZATION	of that city have been searching for an early copy of the first edition of Wal - ton 's Angler , and have just succeeded in obtaining an unusually perfect copy of the same for their customer .

		Although the price paid for this rare treasure is not stated , yet a fair idea of its value can be formed from the fact that the two last copies sold in
London	LOCATION	auc - tion rooms brought 235 and 310 respectively .

		A short description of this interesting book will not be amiss , as comparatively few persons have been fortun - ate enough to see a copy .

		It was issued in
1653	DATE	, and the title-page describes it as `` The Compleat Angler , or the Contemplative Man 's Recreation , being a discourse of Fish and An - gling , not unworthy the perusal of most Anglers . ''

		The title is followed by a quotation from Scripture , not reproduced in the subsequent editions .

		THE DIAL 235 thee .

		The book was printed by
T. Maxey	PERSON	, for Rich .

		Harriot , in
St. Dunstan	LOCATION	's churchyard ,
Fleet Street	ORGANIZATION	,
1653	DATE	.

		During the progress of the printing , and after several copies had been sold , it was discovered that the word '' contentment `` had been misprinted '' contention . ''

		This error has been worth thousands of dollars to deal - ers in '' first editions '' in
this later day	TIME	, as its presence marks the earliest impressions of the plates .

		It is pre - sent in the
Cleveland	LOCATION	copy , and unmistakably establishes its rarity and value .

		What would good old Izaak have thought , had he known that the book , no larger than one 's hand , which he sold through Rich .

		Harriot 's agency for
eighteen pence	MONEY	would be resold two and
a half centuries later	DATE	for more than a thousand dollars !

		THE TRIBULATIONS OF AUTHORSHIP : A CHAPTER OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE .

		A writer in an English paper , who modestly describes himself as a '' literary beginner , '' gives an interesting summary of his actual experience during the first five months of his novitiate , from which it will appear that industry and perseverance are qualities requisite to suc - cess in authorship as in other pursuits , and that aspir - ants for literary honors would do well not to expect too much in the beginning of their career .

		During the period named by this writer , he '' wrote and offered to various journals sixty-seven articles and stories , of which twenty - seven were accepted , fifteen are ' under consideration , ' and twenty-five are in the drawer set apart for rejected HSS .

		Some of these rejected ones , '' says our author , '' will be sent off again ; others are obviously faulty . ''

		Of the twenty-seven accepted HSS. , we learn that `` sixteen were accepted at the first offer , five at the second trial , two at the third time of asking , one at the seventh , and three were ' ordered ' by an editor on the strength of a lucky article which pleased him .

		The payments for these twenty-seven accepted HSS .

		amounted to 96 .

		7s . ''

		Further details are as follows : '' The 27 accepted HSS .

		were , in the aggregate , sent out 42 times ; the 15 which are ` out ' have been offered , in the aggregate , 37 times ; and the 25 which are in the * rejected ' drawer have received among them no fewer than 78 refusals .

		Thus the whole 67 HSS .

		have had a total of 157 separate trials .

		This means 31427 = 287 journeys through the post , and up to the present time not a single HS .

		has been lost , a fact that speaks well for both editors and postmen .

		The cost of postage , both ways , of those 157 offers of HSS .

		has amounted to 2 .

		5s .

		2d .

		say 3 if paper be included ; thus the net profit in respect of the 27 accepted HSS .

		is 96 .

		7s .

		less 3 , or 93 .

		7s .

		The foregoing are actual facts , '' adds the writer , `` and the result is by no means dis - couraging . ''

		FALL ANNOUNCEMENT .

		THE BIBELOT SERIES .

		Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	takes pleasure in announcing his new series of poetical reprints , under the above general title , which he believes will be found more than usually attractive to the book lover and buyer of choice editions .

		For the season of
1893	DATE	the following will be ready early in
November	DATE	: I. Songs of Adieu .

		A little book of recent English lyrics , compiled from sources that are not generally known , or inaccessible in this country .

		II .

		Old World Lyrics .

		A little book of translations from
Villon	LOCATION	, Du Bellay ,
Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	, and later poets .

		It is believed that such dainty specimens of book-making will be welcomed by those who seek for themselves or as a gift to friends , something that will seem more exclusively their own than the ordinary booklet , pretty as it is but seen and sold on every counter .

		To prove that this is not only possible , but also attainable at a moderate price , the BIBELOT SERIES has been planned , and the first two volumes put to press .

		The BIBELOT SERIES is modeled on an old style format , narrow 8vo , and beautifully printed on Van Gelder 's hand-made paper , uncut edges ; done up in flexible
Japan	LOCATION	vellum wrapper , with original design in color , and each issue strictly limited to 725 copies .

		Price per Volume ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	Net .

		7 '' Advance orders solicited , and specimen pages sent on application .

		`` Next to living in a foreign country , this is undoubtedly - the best of all methods for learning modern languages . ''

		`` It is a marvel of condensation and lucidity .

		In no other book is the same field covered so succinctly and so well .

		Of the five chapters , the first deals with the Colonial epoch , the second with the Revolution - ary period , the third and fourth review the history of the Federal Gov - ernment to the outbreak of the Civil War , and the fifth depicts the era of rupture and reconstruction .

		We have marked certain passages for extract , but the truth is that almost every page is enriched with strik - ing comments that cause the reader to carefully reconsider , if not to change , his views of historical persons and events . ''

		276 ANONYMITY IN LITERARY CRITICISM .

		The question of responsibility for criticism is one of the most difficult with which the liter - ary profession has to deal .

		Should it be signed or unsigned , personal or impersonal ; should it express the opinion of an individual or of an organ ?

		The question has been ably and am - ply discussed from both points of view , and both systems -LRB- in English-speaking countries , at least -RRB- have been found to work well in prac - tice .

		In behalf of the principle of anonymity it is argued , first , that criticism has increased weight when put forth with all the authority of a paper or review that has gained the confi - dence of the public ; second , that by this method alone is untrammelled criticism , free from per - sonal obligations or reservations , to be secured .

		Upon these two leading arguments the case for anonymity rests ; others are occasionally brought forward , but examination shows them to be either of a derivative nature or of minor importance .

		In behalf of the criticism for which personal responsibility is assumed , we are told , first , that all such criticism really is the work of in - dividuals , and that it is unworthy to pretend that it is anything else ; second , that inten - tional unfairness is less likely to be displayed when authorship is avowed than when it is con - cealed ; third , that injustice is done to the critic himself when the periodical to which he con - tributes assumes all the credit for his work , and that this assumption reacts upon the work , tending to make it colorless and weak .

		It is hardly necessary for the editors of THE DIAL to state that the arguments for personal responsibility seem to them the weightier , since they have , from the start , adhered to the prac - tice of publishing signed criticisms of all the im - portant works reviewed .

		While granting that the impersonal system has some advantages , it seems to admit of still more abuses .

		The nature of these abuses has been succinctly set forth by Mr.
Besant	PERSON	in a recent article .

		He says : '' I should rejoice to see the custom of signing crit - icisms in literature and art become general , for several reasons .

		First , because it would instantly , I believe , demolish the flippant smartness and insolence with which some papers allow their columns to be disfigured smartness which disguises the fact that the critic knows 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, nothing of his subject ; it would force the writer at least to read the book ; it would put an end to the reviewing of books in the batch ; it would make the young critic anxious to advance his own name as a writer who can deliver carefully considered judgment in the courteous language of a gentleman ; this language he would study to preserve in his work , or to learn if he had never learned it ; and it would enormously raise the position and status of a critic in the eyes of the editor , as well as those of the reading public .

		That it would also rap - idly advance the capable critic in his own profession may be taken for granted . ''

		For these reasons , and for others of a similar character , we think it desirable that the au - thorship of literary criticism should , as a rule , be acknowledged .

		There is , however , one abuse connected with the system of signed reviews that requires a moment 's consideration .

		When this system is in use , the temptation is strong to secure the names of well-known writers , regardless of their fitness for the work .

		We have far too much of this misdirected effort , both in the sensa - tional press of the day and of the month .

		Some periodicals of this sort display title-pages or tables of contents in which the names of their contributors appear in heavy-faced type , while the subjects of the contributions are printed in the most modest and inconspicuous of char - acters .

		In fact , one of the greatest vices of our periodical press is this willingness to ap - peal to the public ear by means of names rather than by means of serious and competent dis - cussion .

		When the subject considered is sub - ordinated to the personality of the man who writes about it , we have reached something very like a reductio ad absurdum of the sys - tem .

		At all events , we have shown how a sys - tem , excellent in principle , may be condemned by its own excesses .

		On the other hand , the anonymous system too easily lends itself to con - cealment of the poverty of the resources at the command of a review .

		When criticism is to be unsigned , there is an increased difficulty in ob - taining criticism of the best quality , and edi - tors will sometimes succumb to the temptation afforded by the fact that , however inefficient the work offered them may be , it must share in the general prestige of the periodical in which it appears .

		As regards the two abuses just considered , the one appears to be no more probable or dangerous than the other ; in either case , the abuse in question will not be charge - able to any editor who accepts the responsibil - ities of his position .

		In other words , the edi - tor who is determined to present his readers with serious and honest criticism will refuse to publish incompetent work , whether it come baited with a well-known name or bear no name at all .

		When we consider the influence upon the writer himself -LRB- assuming him to be competent -RRB- of the knowledge that his work is to be signed or unsigned , it seems to us that the argument for personally acknowledged criticism is much the better .

		It is so easy for the anonymous critic to be unfair , to allow his work to be col - ored by a personal prejudice against which it is impossible for the reader to be on his guard .

		The best of the anonymous reviews show occa - sional examples of very uncritical prejudice , which , as a rule obvious enough to the expert in such matters , is entirely unperceived by the average reader .

		Sometimes , indeed , the preju - dice is so deftly concealed as to impose upon the very elect .

		That this evil is greatly lessened when criticism is acknowledged should be ap - parent enough .

		There are cases , no doubt , in which the reviewer who is to sign his criticism will fail , for personal reasons , to speak out his whole mind , and an occasional work may , in consequence , receive a more generous measure of praise than it deserves .

		But this evil ap - pears to us of minor importance when com - pared with the evil of prejudice protected by anonymity , and unrestrained by any sense of personal responsibility .

		Without going as far as
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, when he calls anonymity the '' shield of all literary rascality , '' we may find a certain satisfaction in his vigorous denuncia - tion of the system . ''

		It was introduced under the pretext of protecting the honest critic , who warned the public against the resentment of the author and his friends .

		But where there is one case of this sort there will be a hundred where it merely serves to take all responsibility from the man who can not stand by what he
Jias	PERSON	said , or pos - sibly to conceal the shame of one who has been cowardly and base enough to recommend a book to the public for the purpose of putting money into his own pocket .

		Often enough it is only a cloak for covering the ob - scurity , incompetence , and insignificance of the critic .

		It is incredible what impudence these fellows will show , and what literary trickery they will venture to commit , as soon as they know they are safe under the shadow of anonymity . ''

		There is much force in this , and there is pith in the author 's further suggestion that a man should be answerable for what he writes , '' at any rate with his honor , if he has any ; and if he has none , let his name neutralize the effect of his words . ''

		Thus we see that one of the two leading ar - guments for anonymity does not seem , upon careful examination , to be well based .

		The other argument that criticism bearing the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 authority of a review has greater weight than that which bears but the authority of an indi - vidual might be dismissed with the question : Why should criticism have any greater weight than attaches to the authority of its writer ?

		But there is really more than this to be said upon the subject .

		A critical periodical should be more than a mere collection of essays .

		It is a pitiful theory that regards a review as a mere dumping-ground for all sorts of opinions .

		A review should stand for something ; it should represent sane intelligence upon the subjects with which it is concerned ; it should march in the vanguard of thought .


M. Zola	PERSON	, who has re - cently , in his address before the
London	LOCATION	Con - ference of Journalists , stirred up the question of anonymity , goes astray at this point .

		His plea is for personal responsibility in criticism , and is excellently urged , but he attempts to make an unreal distinction between political and literary criticism .

		He expresses the opin - ion that political discussion should be imper - sonal , and adds : '' At the same time , I confess that if I recognize the necessity for anonymity in political matters , I am none the less surprised that it can exist in literary matters .

		Here I entirely fail to grasp the situation .

		I refer especially to articles of criticism , judgments pronounced upon the play , the book , the work of art .

		Can there be such a thing as the literature , the art of a party ?

		That discipline , average opinion , should prevail in pol - itics is certainly wise .

		But that a literary or artistic production should be adapted to suit the views of a whole party , that a scythe should be used to cut down everybody to the same level , that all should be mixed up in a common herd , in order to politely please your public , this I consider to be dangerous to the intellec - tual vitality of a nation .

		This sort of regimental crit - cism , speaking in the name of a majority , can only end in producing a mediocre , colorless literature . ''

		The mistake here is in the assumption that im - personal discussion , whether political or artis - tic , must be partisan .

		But it can not for a mo - ment be admitted that either the one or the other is necessarily partisan , except in the sense that it must take the part of knowl - edge against ignorance , of intelligence against dulness , of sanity against eccentricity , of ra - tionality against irrationality .

		We do not de - cide against anonymous literary criticism be - cause of its assumed tendency to become parti - san , or to express average opinion it can not well be the one , and ought not to do the other but for the far more cogent reasons above set forth , and also recognized by
M. Zola else	PERSON	- where in his address .

		It must be remembered that a critical review has to deal with all sorts of subjects , not only with belles lettres , but with history and science and philosophy as well .

		The word partisanship has no meaning when applied to so wide a range of interests .

		Recurring once more to the main argument for anonymity , we would say , finally , that the criticism which is published in a review of high character and recognized authority does receive added weight from that very fact , if signed no less than if unsigned .

		We do not believe that the addition of a signature detracts from the authority of the criticism , and we are sure that it adds to the reader 's confidence in the sincer - ity of the writer .

		If the name of the writer is well-known , his opinion comes with the added authority of the review in which it appears ; if the name is not well-known , the importance to be attached to the opinion will be measured , not by the obscurity of the writer , but by the confidence which the editorial conduct of the review inspires .

		In a word , when critical arti - cles are signed , there is at least no loss of weight , and there may be a distinct increment of gain .

		The last editions of the ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- paedia Britannica '' and of Chambers 's '' Ency - clopaedia '' are the better and the more author - itative from the fact that their chief contribu - tions are acknowledged .

		`` The Fortnightly Review , '' with its signed articles , quickly gained a higher prestige than had been enjoyed by the anonymous quarterlies .

		If '' The Athenaeum '' and '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' and '' The Na - tion , '' following the example of '' The Acad - emy '' and THE DIAL , were to adopt the sys - tem of signed criticisms , they would probably exert a deeper influence than they do at pres - ent , and would certainly command a more un - reserved confidence from their constituency .

		THE WORLD 'S CONGRESS AUXILIARY .

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	Congresses of
1893	DATE	were for - mally closed on the
28th of October	DATE	.

		On the morning of this date a final meeting was held at the
Chicago Art Institute	ORGANIZATION	, attended by mem - bers of the various Committees of Organiza - tion , and presided over by President
Charles C. Bonney	PERSON	.

		A report by the Secretary of the Auxiliary , Mr.
C. E. Young	PERSON	, was read , and brief addresses were made by a number of peo - ple .

		President
Bonney	PERSON	, whose nearly four years ' untiring labor as the originator and ac - tive head of the Auxiliary has been crowned with such signal success , gave , in his farewell address , an elaborate review of its history and of the work accomplished .

		There have been 252 -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, held in all more than two hundred separate Congresses , with a total of over twelve hundred sessions , nearly six thousand speakers , and an aggregate attendance of about seven hundred thousand .

		Eminent men and women from all parts of the world actively participated , and among the papers read were many of lasting value , whose importance can only be known to the world at large by the permanent publica - tion that is contemplated and is so much to be desired .

		We have space only for a few of the more significant passages of President
Bonney	PERSON	's address : `` The World 's Congresses of
1893	DATE	were organ - ized to establish fraternal relations among the lead - ers of mankind ; to review the progress already achieved ; to state the living problems now awaiting solution , and to suggest the means of future ad - vancement .

		To promote those high ends , the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	provided for the pre - sentation of the intellectual and moral progress of mankind , in connection with the World 's
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition , in a series of World 's Congresses under the auspices of the
Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	, with the assist - ance of the leaders in the various departments of human achievement .

		The work of organization commenced in
October , 1889	DATE	, was completed , and the first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the series opened , in
May , 1893	DATE	.

		The last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	embraced in the great scheme has just been held .

		That these Congresses have been successful far beyond anticipation ; that they have transformed into enduring realities the hopes of those who organized and conducted them ; and that they will exercise a benign and potent influence on the welfare of mankind through the coming centuries , has been so often , so emphat - ically , and so eloquently declared by eminent rep - resentatives of different countries and peoples , that these statements may be accepted as established facts .

		That the material exhibit of the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
Jackson Park	LOCATION	is the most complete and magnificent ever presented to human view , is generally agreed ; but a multitude of emi - nent witnesses have declared , after attendance on both , that the intellectual and moral exposition of the progress of mankind presented in the World 's Congresses of
1893	DATE	is greater and more imposing still .

		Thus the work of the World 's
Congress Aux	ORGANIZATION	- iliary of the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	takes its enduring place in human history . ''

		After a few remarks upon the press reports , the minor Congresses , and the serious charac - ter of the audiences participating , the address was continued as follows : '' Another feature of the Congresses deserves es - pecial mention .

		It is their self-governing quality .

		There has been little need for the enforcement of rules and regulations .

		Few speakers have given occasion for a call to order .

		The spirit of order , de - corum , dignity , and peace has been sovereign dur - ing the sessions of these Congresses .

		This ruling spirit has so promptly rebuked any attempt to over - step the limits of propriety as to leave little occa - sion for presiding officers to exercise their author - ity ; little occasion to guard seats reserved for del - egates , or to insist upon tickets or badges of ad - mission .

		The machinery of organization and the general regulations adopted for the government of the Congresses have proved remarkably satisfac - tory . ''

		The following justly deserved tribute was paid to the local committees , who had so es - sential a share in the work of the Auxiliary : `` The time now at my command will not permit me even to name the many
Committees of Organiza	ORGANIZATION	- tion by which the various Congresses were arranged .

		It is , however , both my duty and my pleasure to say of them that the fidelity , the patience and the zeal , the ability , the discrimination and the execu - tive skill with which the chairmen and members of the more than two hundred committees of organi - zation have conducted the correspondence , made the arrangements and formed the programmes for the more than two hundred Congresses which have been held in the twenty departments of the
Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	, constitute one of the marvels of the World 's Con - gress work .

		The discipline and subordination which have attended the execution of the great and com - plicated scheme would do honor to the best organ - ized department of any government .

		So efficiently and so silently have these committees done their work that the great public they have served needs to be reminded of their part in the splendid results achieved .

		A publication which will present the full membership of these and the other Committees of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	is in contempla - tion . ''

		The question of publication of the proceed - ings of the Congresses was thus further touched upon : '' The extraordinary merit of the proceedings of the whole series of Congresses renews our confidence that the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	, which sent our publications and communications through - out the world , and gave the World 's
Congress Aux	ORGANIZATION	- iliary an exalted position as the duly authorized agency to organize and conduct the World 's Con - gresses of
1893	DATE	, will furnish the means to publish o 7 * the entire proceedings in an enclyclopaedic form , and send the same to the colleges , the universities , and the leading libraries of the countries which have participated in the World 's Columbian Expo - sition , as the most appropriate , enduring , and valu - able testimonial of the appreciation by the American people of the cooperation and aid of the other peo - ples of the world in the great events of this quadro - centennial year .

		To that end , let all who have been interested in the Congresses exert their influence in favor of such a publication and distribution . ''

		THE DIAL 253 THE MASTER OF BALLIOL .

		When we wrote about the late Dr.
Jowett	PERSON	in our last issue , we predicted that the comment of the reviews would be largely personal in character .

		It could hardly be otherwise in the case of a man whose personality was so striking , and who so strongly impressed those who were associated with him at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have made a few extracts from the notices elicited by the news of his death , taking them mostly from English sources .

		The Rev.
H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	, whom the death of no dis - tinguished Englishman finds unprepared , promptly sent the following sonnet to the `` Academy '' : '' aged head !

		never-aging face !

		O cheery hand-shake , wise and twinkling eye !

		Ours until memory of all good shall die , Master , gone on before a moment 's space !

		Our hearts are all at
Oxford	LOCATION	, see thee pace The green quadrangle , watch thee standing by That oriel window , whence philosophy Would pause to wonder at the chestnut 's grace , Or smile on young men 's frolic .

		Thou art dead !

		But never dead thy daring still to prove The Truths men live by ; one against the world !

		Nor dead thy calm that met the tempest hurled , The quiet following of the Christ thy head , In deeds of pure self-sacrifice and love . ''

		In the `` Academy '' appears also an article signed ''
J. S. C.	PERSON	, '' which comes to the following conclu - sion : '' It was impossible to be in
Jowett	PERSON	's company even if , as sometimes happened , he did not open his mouth without recognizing that he was a remarkable man .

		That noble forehead with its nimbus of silver hair , that mild eye and cherubic countenance , that beautiful soft - ness of hand , that small rotund figure clad in old-fash - ioned garb , that venerable bearing all combined to make up a picture which no painter has adequately re - produced .

		Add the thin , small voice , the deliberate intonations that could be either bitter or sweet , the abrupt questionings that sometimes quivered like a dart , the intervals of silence that were yet more formidable , the wise maxims that come only from age and experi - ence ; and some part of the secret of
Jowett	PERSON	's charm will be understood .

		No Oxford don had a wider circle of acquaintance in the outer world ; none knew inti - mately so many generations of undergraduates .

		He possessed , in supreme measure , that power , invaluable to statesmen and generals , of penetrating the character of others at a glance .

		Of his exceeding kindness to in - dividuals , and of his munificence when such was needed , it is not necessary to speak .

		His college stood to him in the place of a wife , and he took a paternal interest in the careers of its sons .

		Of the affection with which they regarded him , some instances have been seen this very week .

		But there is no Oxford man , however much opposed he may have occasionally felt to
Jowett	PERSON	's teach - ing , who will not recognize , at the moment of his death , that the university has lost its grandest figure . ''

		The opinion of the ``
Saturday	DATE	Review '' is thus non-committally given : '' Of Mr.
Jowett	PERSON	's great intellectual ability there could be but one opinion , and he combined with it a knowledge of the world unusual in the case of a scholar and a man of great reserve and shyness who lived all his life in academic surroundings .

		By a combination of personal influence over undergraduates , and of adroit management of the patronage which was put in his hands by governments -LRB- not , we believe , of one party only -RRB- , he raised his college to a position unequalled in its peculiar way , or only equalled by
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	under Dean
Cyril Jackson	PERSON	long ago .

		Assisted by his pupils , he gave to the common English reader as easy an access to the two greatest prose authors of
Greece Plato	LOCATION	and Thucydides as anyone can have without Greek , and so gained that reader 's ear and suffrage .

		For the rest , his character and career , both public and private , were regarded by different classes of persons with respect , with disapproval , with affection , with dis - like in a degree most unusual . ''

		Another paragraph from the same paper dwells upon the conservative aspect of his mind : '' His youth was passed among historical doubters , and he did not change with the times .

		He never took much interest in archaeology or anthropology as illus - trative of history .

		Probably he did not actually disbe - lieve that hieroglyphics had been interpreted , and cunei - form texts deciphered , but there may have survived a grain of doubt upon the actuality of such studies .

		Epigraphy , the study of Greek inscriptions , he almost publicly scouted , saying that inscriptions had much the same interest as autographs .

		New pursuits were not dear to him , and , while some of the erudite sneered or marvelled , his friends only smiled to see how simple and how conservative was the mind of this heresiarch .

		The epigram about ' what I know not is not knowledge ' was little more than a humorous exaggeration .

		His ' ply was taken long ago , ' and the Master never knew how antique some of his opinions really were .

		Yet ' gladly would he learn , ' especially in conversation with men who had seen and done great things , who had been conversant with affairs and with adventures .

		The shy college don knew how to war against his mood , how to make and keep friends among men of the wide world , statesmen , travellers . ''

		The following comment is from the
London	LOCATION	'' Literary World '' : '' No man did so much to adapt the
University	ORGANIZATION	to mod - ern needs .

		From the time his replies helped to guide the
Commission of 1852	ORGANIZATION	in their work of making the colleges open to all instead of being a collection of close clerical corporations , through the agitations for strengthening the
University	ORGANIZATION	at the expense of the col - leges , enlarging the professoriate , establishing scholar - ships , admitting unattached students , and recently
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, he has always been protagonist on the liberal side .

		His books are very variously esti - mated by scholars , and perhaps are more useful to reader and thinker than to a trained critic ; but it is no mean performance to have ` made Plato an English classic , ' as has been said .

		His direct influence on the men , too many to enumerate , who have gone out from his tuition to influence the world in politics , law , and literature , is a surer monument ; and we may say safely that far more in our modern thought than one would naturally ascribe to him is due to the influence of Ben - jamin
Jowett	PERSON	. ''

		The progressive aspect of
Jowett	PERSON	's mind is em - phasized by the '' Athenaeum '' article , which explains in some detail the nature of his work for the Uni - versity .

		254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, `` In the government of the
University	ORGANIZATION	he played an important part , and one which even those who widely differed from him would allow was worthy of himself .

		Liberalism has not in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, any more than in the political world , always meant the same thing or moved in the same direction .

		But from the time of the first
Commission	ORGANIZATION	in
1852	DATE	down almost to that of
Lord Salisbury 's Commission	ORGANIZATION	in
1877	DATE	, the efforts of the Lib - eral party in the
University	ORGANIZATION	were mainly directed to - wards opening wider the doors of the
University	ORGANIZATION	to classes , creeds , and studies hitherto excluded , and to improving the educational machinery within it .

		With this older
Liberalism Jowett	PERSON	was heartily in sympathy .

		No man had ever a keener sense of the duty which the
University	ORGANIZATION	owes to the nation , or was more anxious to keep it in touch with the world outside ; at the same time nothing was more repugnant to him than ineffi - cient or slack administration .

		Such movements as those for the admission of non-collegiate students , for the extension of
University	ORGANIZATION	teaching in large towns , and for the affiliation of local colleges found in him a warm friend and powerful advocate .

		More recently he in - terested himself actively in drawing closer the ties be - tween
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
India	LOCATION	by facilitating the training of the selected candidates for the
Indian Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, and by obtaining for Oriental languages a recognized place among
University	ORGANIZATION	studies .

		To one form , indeed , which the movement for the expansion of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity assumed , to the proposal for admitting women to
University	ORGANIZATION	examinations , he was at first opposed ; but it was characteristic of him that when once convinced that the demand was a genuine one , he withdrew his opposition . ''

		Recurring once more to the personal view of the Master , we make our final extract from the very interesting contribution of
W. J. A.	PERSON	to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' : ``
Jowett	PERSON	's person was , like his mind , dainty .

		An irreverent writer once spoke of his face as of the tomb - stone-cherub order ; and the phrase was descriptive .

		But cherubs too frequently have something gross in their chubbiness ; and everything about the Master was delicate and fine .

		Perhaps it was his appearance which helped to create the affection which mingled with our awe and respect ; he was the Doctor Seraphicus of the college .

		Yet we trembled when we had to go and see him , even at a breakfast party , to say nothing of less agreeable occasions .

		In his clear little staccato voice he could say such biting things .

		Many were the stories of breakfast parties with long silences , broken by the more adventurous , who suffered accordingly ; of under - graduates taken for walks and left to make the conver - sation with painful results to themselves .

		What was the explanation ?

		we asked ourselves .

		Did the Master enjoy discomfitting the shallow with his rapier thrusts ?

		or could it possibly be that after all these years , he was still shy himself , and said what he did because he could not help it ?

		Probably the last theory , if not complete , was the truer .

		And certainly the undergraduate or voung graduate who had anything really to say , how - ever contrary it might be to the Master 's opinion , and was so interested in the subject that he forgot the mas - tership and spoke out freely , was sure to win
Jowett	PERSON	's esteem .

		Such a conversation , which the young man when he came to his ordinary self thought of with won - der and a flushed face , was not seldom followed by an invitation to dinner . ''

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEWSPAPERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been an interested reader of the recent dis - cussion , in THE DIAL and elsewhere , of what may be called the newspaper problem .

		There is enough need of a campaign for the improvement of our journals .

		The fact , however , must not be lost sight of that the daily papers are commercial enterprises , and we can not hope that as such they will rise higher than the demands of their subscribers and readers .

		The commercial success of a paper depends mainly upon a large advertising pa - tronage and a large number of subscribers .

		The adver - tising patronage depends upon the number of subscribers .

		It is therefore necessary that the paper , in order to get the largest financial return , should make itself acceptable to the largest practicable number of readers .

		We are thus brought to the moral and intellectual status of the com - munity as the basis of determination as to what the nature of the paper shall be .

		I have not myself much faith that the newspapers will very greatly improve except through what may be called the moralization of the community at large .

		When there is an outcry against the moral tone of a paper sufficient to reduce its patronage , it is likely to improve in order to regain or increase its pres - tige .

		Further than this , it may be said that every edi - tor probably desires to make his paper as good as he thinks he can afford to make it .

		This desire comes from the very general wish , on the part of editors as well as others , to merit and receive the esteem of the better class of their fellow-men .

		Through this fact there is an unmistakable advantage to be gained from the crit - icism of any particular paper which may seem to fall below the requirements of the proper moral standard .

		MR.
JOHN BURROUGHS ON POE	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Without taking up the cudgels for Poe and trying to think of one real thing made more dear to us by his matchless rhyme , without depreciating our New En - gland poets and hinting that it might have been yet better had they cared a little more for art , one may still feel that all is not for the best in the remarks of Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	in your last number -LRB- unless , perhaps , we at once turn the page and consider some of the ques - tions put by Mrs.
Woolley	PERSON	toward the beginning of her communication -RRB- .

		It is doubtless true that there are many with whom the purely art value , so-called , is the only thing to consider in a poem or a picture .

		But the number of such is , on the whole , small .

		It is quite right to say that with most readers this view is held less and less in sight .

		We in
America	LOCATION	, at least , need no incitement to value literature , or anything else , for its practical worth , or for what may seem such .

		If we need caution , it is on the other side .

		We do not need to be told that thought is important , we know it is , and we are always on the lookout for it .

		But we do need to be told that art or style is of value too , for , as a rule , we are not so much on the lookout for that ; or , if we are , we do n't know it so well when we see it .

		The more we are told by critics whom we honor -LRB- like Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	-RRB- that thought is important and that art counts for less , the more do we fall into the error that thought is all-important and that art counts
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 for nothing , and then we have poems like Miss
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's , for example .

		Now style , or form , or art , or whatever else one may call it , is important .

		And , more to the point , style is difficult .

		It is difficult to attain , and it is , on the whole , difficult to appreciate .

		That it is difficult to appreciate good style , may seem a hard saying ; one may think that if a thing be done in the best way everybody will recognize it .

		It is not so .

		To appreciate style needs training .

		And this training we in
America	LOCATION	will not undergo , so long as we are told that art is unimportant .

		One great use of the '' full-blown professional liter - ary critic '' is that he is apt to insist on art for art 's sake .

		And one great good thing in a poet like
Poe	PERSON	is that he shows us what art for art 's sake can do .

		There is small danger that we shall go too far with either .

		There are comparatively few so constituted by nature that they ever could enjoy art for art 's sake if they wanted to .

		There is little danger that we shall go too far in that direction .

		The important thing is that we go at all .

		And go some way we must , or literature runs down-hill , and at the bottom we have a horde of writers with plenty of thought perhaps , with plenty of messages for their time , with plenty of feeling for life , and with the highest ethical or sociological aspirations , but no style at all because they do n't know what it is .

		Especially here in the West do we need to be con - stantly reminded of the value of art , to be taught what is style , to be told even -LRB- though it is n't so -RRB- that form in art is everything .

		We are not likely to take it too much to heart , and we may learn something from it .

		I some - times almost wish that Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	would come out here again .

		He could hardly get us to be like
Gil	PERSON	- bert and
Ernest	PERSON	and
Cyril	PERSON	and
Vivian	PERSON	, but he might perhaps prevent us from becoming what we are likely to become if we persist in binding it upon the tablets of our hearts that good poetry is only a criticism of life .

		THE DECORATIVE SCULPTURE AT THE FAIR , AND ITS PRESERVATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of all that was grand at the World 's Fair , the en - semble of buildings , grouped as they were around the courts and lagoons , and on the shore of the lake , was undoubtedly the grandest .

		To my mind , it gave the chief magnificence to the Exposition .

		When the archi - tectural parts are poor they make such a fair only a big '' show , '' but no aesthetic display .

		At
Chicago	LOCATION	, how - ever , the classical architecture imitated in the chief halls of exhibit gave the whole complexity of crowded busy life a most elevated , almost solemn , character , that has certainly not been equalled since the days of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Next to the buildings , however , the sculptural work such as the decoration of the edges of the roofs , the entrances , the borders of the lagoons caught the eye of the somewhat satiated traveller .

		Occasionally one was too much reminded of foreign models , somewhat distasteful to our more severe minds ; for example , the group at one of the entrances to the Horticultural Building , where the background of the statuary is made up of substantial plaster clouds .

		That is almost too much in the line of the purely decorative .

		Other groups , however , that were not connected with any building , but were isolated and free , pleased the eye as something original and truly monumental .

		Thus , the statues flanking the staircase leading into the canal from the
Machinery Hall	ORGANIZATION	gave me a genuine pleasure .

		They represent two young men returning from the field with their horses .

		These statues certainly were among the most vivid impressions received at the Fair .

		They had , however , their pendants on the opposite side , in virgins leading oxen to sacrifice .

		How flat those Vic - tories were when compared with their counterparts !

		There is a certain exaggeration in the imitation of clas - sical style nowadays that does not contrast favorably with the simple portrayal of real life .

		The latter has all the freshness of what is seen and known ; while those maids with palms in their hands seem studied and ar - tificial rather than original iq sensation , and do not move our imagination except by an effort .

		Perhaps one reason is that the bull is too massive and the virgin too lean .

		How much more should I have wished to see a milkmaid as she appears abroad , in her national cos - tume , leading her cow to grass , or resting her arms on the back of the leader of the herd , a strong-limbed woman , with her hair bare , a kerchief around her neck , and home-made shoes !

		But the American ideal of a woman , even in the farming class , is not that of broad - limbed health , but of slender physique and a certain air de societe that bears no resemblance to the simple child of nature .

		Thus , of a woman to match the splen - did figure of a farmer such as the limitless stretches of fertile soil produce in
America	LOCATION	, there is no representa - tion , only the high-stepped classical version of a wing - less
Nike	ORGANIZATION	, a compliment I hope no American woman failed to see while passing the groups .

		In the groups of plough-horses with their drivers , no effort is needed to transport us into an atmosphere congenial to the mo - tif represented .

		What we see , we see as a recollection from nature , and it charms us as such chiefly because it is in itself beautiful .

		The well-built horse is massive , but not clumsy .

		What a power is latent in his strong limbs , his broad breast !

		he bends his neck proudly , as if knowing how much he can perform ; with no broken courage , ready to attempt whatever he is led to .

		And the young man , with his straight well-developed body , his energetic bearing , his healthy appearance , and loose clothing , seems a fair representation of the strong sin - ewy set that builds up the country and is the foundation of all its welfare , bred and grown under the lumi - nous blue sky of
America	LOCATION	, hardened and strengthened by work in the open air .

		Another pair of statues to which I also took a great liking were the two horsemen in front -LRB- if I am not mis - taken -RRB- of the
Transportation Building	ORGANIZATION	.

		They represent an Indian and a Mexican , both in characteristic atti - tudes .

		They seem the only ones that , besides the ploughboys , could be said to be reproductions of Amer - ican life .

		The Indian I think is in himself an excellent object for statuary .

		His sinewy body , his partial naked - ness , his picturesque buskins , the agility and nervous fire shown by himself as well as by his animal , offer a splendid illustration of primitive military spirit ; while the Mexican , with his more elegant attire , his proud bearing , his superior degree of culture and native grace , offers another illustration that is many degrees higher , although both figures are interesting and original .

		As I looked at these splendid pieces , I became ab - sorbed with the thought : what a pity that such pic - turesque groups will soon be a heap of plaster , and disappear !

		What an acquisition to a park for the city , if these monuments could be preserved , transformed into a durable material like bronze !

		Perhaps the expend - THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, iture of the Exposition has already proved too great , and prevents the preservation of the buildings ; but groups like those of the ploughboys , and the Mexican and his mate , would commemorate a new phase of sculpture in
America	LOCATION	.

		At any rate , may it be pardoned , if , under the recollection of their merits , their preservation is sin - cerely wished by A TRAVELLING EUROPEAN .


Champaign	LOCATION	, III. ,

		A `` WESTERN STYLE '' IN LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The recent editorial in THE DIAL on '' The Literary West '' was doubtless read with approval by very many , but more especially , perhaps , by such ' as had recently considered Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	's views on the by him newly discovered '' Western Literature , '' as expressed in his letter to the
London	LOCATION	Times . ''

		The idea that '' The West '' as a distinct province of the
United States	LOCATION	should of right have a characteristic literature of its own is , I suppose , new to many thoughtful persons , but is ap - proved probably by very few .

		It is true that , at present at least , a great part of the literature produced by Western writers will have a dis - tinctly local or sectional coloring .

		The present preva - lence of the so-called dialect poem and the dialect story , or , indeed , of realistic fiction of any kind , renders it natural that in many cases Western writers should se - lect particularly Western subjects .

		But that there should ever be a style that could be called characteristically '' Western '' is by no means to be hoped for or desired .

		Some of the most markedly Western qualities are such as would be ruinous to a good style .

		In this matter the best authors are , and delight to be , conservative : they recognize to a great degree con - ventional usage and established authority .

		The free - dom and individualism , the push and enterprise , of West - ern life are qualities that have done a great deal for the material growth of the West ; but they will hardly accom - plish so much in the production of a good style .

		On the other hand , they will be apt to hinder it .

		And the West has other characteristics by no means so admir - able as these named and far worse in their effect on lit - erature .

		We must , I believe , hold tenaciously to the idea ex - pressed toward the close of the article referred to , that '' Except in their relation to choice of subject matter the terms
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western , Northern and South - ern , have absolutely no literary meaning in a country all of whose parts have a common speech . ''

		A > H ' M - A CURIOSITY OF LITERARY STYLE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The service which Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	has rendered to the cause of good English is beyond estimation .

		The writer is one of a large number who have read his con - tributions to '' The Nation '' and THE DIAL with great profit .

		This pleasure has not been enhanced , however , by a peculiarity of style which the following quotations may serve to exemplify : `` And here , not unfitly , I may quote De Foe and
Sterne	PERSON	, as having , with , presumably , many another , at least seemed '' etc. -LRB- `` The Nation , '' xlvi. , p. 215 . -RRB-

		`` Most all , with most any , etc. , may , in like manner , have reappeared , in very late times , quite independently '' etc. .

		-LRB- Ibid. , p. 342 . -RRB-

		`` Having chanced on a parcel of notes , long ago mislaid , I find that , taken with some recent memorandums , they enable me to supplement , on several points , and those not unimpor - tant , the details given , under these words , in the New En - glish Dictionary . ''

		-LRB- Ibid. , liv. , p. 10 . -RRB-

		`` And , as were , with him , our forefathers , so , by the logic of antipathy , were their descendants , down to the latest . ''

		-LRB- Ibid. , p. 11 . -RRB-

		The broken character of these sentences is painful , even to the eye ; but its full effect can be realized only by an attempt to read them aloud .

		In some cases , to be sure , the difficulty is nothing more than the insertion of the comma where there is no break in thought sufficient to call for its presence .

		In THE DIAL of
August 16 , 1893	DATE	, we read : '' But , for all that , it chances , curiously enough , that , in nearly all cases , '' etc. .

		The first ten words of this sentence embrace five commas , two of which are of no apparent utility and are not sustained by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's own usage in many similar cases .

		The following sentence would surely be much im - proved by the removal of commas , and the slight changes in order which their removal might require : '' Accordingly , I doubt whether ' none but they ' and ' no - body but I , ' which , in the diction of prose , were , already in Gray 's age , dropping out of literary currency , are , for us , altogether faultless . ''

		-LRB- THE DIAL ,
Oct. 1	DATE	, p. 180 . -RRB-

		I am unacquainted with Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's books , but a glance at the preface of '' Modern English '' reveals the fol - lowing : '' But , let Englishmen scorn us , and move our just aver - sion , as they may , the fact still stands , that , looking to their superior culture , literary and social , we shall do wisely '' etc. .

		Again : '' Yet , to risk a negative , expressed or implied , if perilous in any case , is , above all , perilous , when it concerns an article of language . ''

		-LRB- Ibid. , p. 96 . -RRB-

		And yet again : '' We are admonished , too , that , as to starve , because it meant , with our remote forefathers , more than it now means , namely , ` perish from cold , hunger , etc. , ' we are ' inaccurate , ' in limiting its application ; '' etc. -LRB- Ibid. , p. 280 . -RRB-

		One has to penetrate no farther than the second sen - tence of the treatise on English Adjectives in - able to find ten commas embraced within a group of thirty-six words : `` Subsequently , however , on thinking over the matter , I found , that , in order to treat , with desirable thoroughness , of Reliable and words similar , it was necessary to survey , in connexion with them , our adjectives in - able generally . ''

		While turning , the pages of '' Exemplifications of False Philology , '' I noted the following : '' Long ago , it may be presumed , the reader has discovered , in Mr.
White	PERSON	, the peculiarity , that , when he employs lan - guage which , '' etc. -LRB- P. 70 . -RRB-

		These citations are surely sufficient in number , range , and character , to indicate a persistent feature of the au - thor 's style .

		Perhaps , at a moment 's notice , he might fill a whole page of THE DIAL with parallels from the writers of a half-dozen centuries .

		We venture the opin - ion , however , that they would not be from writers who have won any reputation for graceful expression of their ideas .

		We do not forget that the nature of Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's work required the frequent insertion of a long series of partic - ulars separated by commas .

		Sentences affected by this necessity have no connexion with the above discussion .

		In closing , the writer desires to reiterate his grati - tude to Dr.
Hall	PERSON	for many and valuable lessons in the use of words .

		THE DIAL 257 Itfefo Books .

		THE REPUBLIC or
TEXAS	LOCATION	, AND ITS PRESIDENT .

		* Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's
Life of Sam Houston	ORGANIZATION	is at once a good piece of biography , and a concise , lucid account of an historical event that is usu - ally vaguely conceived and sometimes grossly misstated .

		A typical instance of this miscon - ception as well as of the facility with which the British mind contrives to read American history to American disadvantage is seen in the following paragraph , touching the war of Independence in
Texas	LOCATION	, from Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's recent book on the United States : ''
Houston	LOCATION	, an American filibuster and an old comrade of
Jackson	PERSON	, with a body of intrusive Americans , had planted himself in
Texas	LOCATION	, which belonged to the Repub - lic of
Mexico	LOCATION	, and when the Mexicans took arms to put him down and recover their province , had defeated them at the battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	. ''

		That is to say , the Texan war was simply an effort on the part of the Mexican government to oust a band of marauding Americans who had been led over the border by
Sam Houston	LOCATION	.

		As a matter of fact
Houston	LOCATION	did not set out for
Texas	LOCATION	until about two years after hostilities had virtually begun ; and the Texan revolt was , as our author shows , in its original character , not a filibuster enterprise pure and simple , but an uprising of recognized colonists against the oppression of a revolutionary and illegitimate government .

		That there was throughout the war an accompanying element of filibustering and intrigue is undeniable .

		The fact remains , nevertheless , that Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's '' body of intru - sive Americans '' resolves itself on inspection largely into a body of established citizens who represented about all there was in the province of
Texas	LOCATION	of thrift , enterprise , and capacity for developing its resources .

		The inhabitants of the representative Mexican department of
Bexar	LOCATION	, for example , were in a state of semi-barbarism , shiftless and indolent , carrying on a rude agri - culture , adding nothing to the progress of the country , and really less civilized and prosper - ous than under the Spanish rule in the early part of the century .

		The moribund Mexican towns in the interior , with their mongrel pop - ulace whose worldly interests were sunk in the fandango and the cock-fight , were , industrially , beneath contempt .

		From the statistical report of the Mexican Inspector ,
Almonte	PERSON	, quoted in * SAM
HOUSTON	LOCATION	and the War of Independence in
Texas	LOCATION	.

Alfred M.Williams	PERSON	.

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		some detail by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, it is manifest that the real root of the growth and prosperity of
Texas	LOCATION	was in the agricultural colonies -LRB- chiefly that of
Austin	LOCATION	-RRB- founded under land grants from the Mexican government to American empres - arios or contractors .

		And it is in these colo - nies that we are to look for the germs of the Anglo-American occupation of
Texas	LOCATION	, and of its final release from the titular sway of the Hispaiio-Mexicans .

		Defensible or not , the sep - aration was natural and inevitable .

		To argue that
Mexico	LOCATION	should have been left undisturbed in her purely nominal possession of a vast tract which she could neither occupy , govern , nor develop , and which , moreover , she had acquired by revolting from a government whose own title was founded in conquest , is to argue for a ten - derness of international conscience that has never been displayed in the world 's history , and must have proved a fatal bar to the world 's progress .

		If the title of the present occupants of
Texas	LOCATION	be primarily illegitimate and founded in theft -LRB- '' public rapine , '' Mr.
Smith	PERSON	calls it -RRB- , then there is not a single humanly-inhabited square mile of the earth 's surface in the hands of legitimate owners to-day .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has noted the fact that
England	LOCATION	, while accustomed to judge her own national behavior by the act - ual standard , always applies the absolute stand - ard to other countries , '' and particularly to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		She applied it to us very rigor - ously in this
Texas	LOCATION	matter .

		The reproach of '' public rapine , '' however , coming from a pre - eminently grasping and meddling nation that has one hand on the throat of
Ireland	LOCATION	and the other in the pockets of
India	LOCATION	, and whose '' morn - ing drum-beat '' -LRB- thanks to her long arm and elastic conscience -RRB- '' circles the earth with one continuous strain , '' is too hollow to rouse resent - ment .

		Owing to the political turmoils which fol - lowed the revolution from
Spain	LOCATION	in
1822	DATE	-LRB- about the time of the founding of
Austin	LOCATION	-RRB- the Amer - ican colonists were left for some years to their own devices .


Mexico	LOCATION	did nothing to protect or to govern her new settlers .

		Sturdy , honest , trained to habits of self-government and self - help , the best representatives of the hardy pioneers who have led the van of civilization across the American continent , they made their own laws , administered their own justice , and organized a militia for their own defence against the Indians and outlaws .

		The ground was cleared and planted ; land titles were duly re - corded ; cabins , schools , and churches were built ; and by
1834	DATE	Brazos , the central department 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, which included the colony of
Austin	LOCATION	, was ex - porting yearly 5,000 bales of cotton and 50 , - 000 hides , at a total valuation of 1275,000 , besides large droves of live-stock of which no estimate is given .

		We may state , by way of comparison , that at this time the total exports of the Mexican department of
Brazos	LOCATION	, with its ancient towns and long-settled country , con - sisted of a paltry total of some 8,000 to 10 , - 000 skins and furs .

		The Anglo-Saxon race were already writing their title to the soil of
Texas	LOCATION	on its surface , and in the records of its new growth and prosperity .

		To the honesty and hospitality of the colonists there is a com - mon testimony .

		Even
Charles Hooten	PERSON	, a vitu - perative Englishman who wrote a book on
Texas	LOCATION	in
1840	DATE	and repaid his hosts by abusing them , admits that '' it was a common custom to leave the doors unfastened when the house was empty , and that seldom or never was anything disturbed . ''

		Says our author : '' No man took another man 's note for a loan , the ver - bal promise of payment being considered sufficient , and all transactions of business were conducted on a fully warranted trust in the general integrity .

		Even those who had left the States on account of pecuniary failure or dishonesty came under the influence of the standard of honesty about them , and remitted the sums due to their distant creditors . ''

		Hospitality was an impulse rather than an obligation ; and the homely saying , '' The latch - string hangs out , '' expressed then , as it does to-day , in
Texas	LOCATION	a fact of common life .

		The chance traveller who rode up to the cabin door was pressed to alight .

		The best that the rude economy of the border home afforded was at his disposal .

		The coffee-mill was set going , the hopper in the hollow log to grinding the corn , the venison or bear-meat was laid on the coals , the ashcake was baked , and after the meal and the evening chat the guest stretched himself on a buffalo-robe on the floor with the members of the family and slept the sleep of security and fatigue .

		In the
morning	TIME	, inquiry as to the charge was met with the reply , '' You can pay me by coming again . ''

		There is even a tradition of an hospitable monomaniac who used to waylay travellers and force them , at the muzzle of a shot-gun , to visit him a hu - morous exaggeration , probably , of the general tendency .

		These agricultural colonists , the real founders of the Texan commonwealth , were a law-abiding people not only in respect of their own local laws , but of their conduct toward the general government , so long as that govern - ment preserved a remnant of legitimacy and fairness .

		In
1826	DATE	, for instance , they sided with the Mexican authorities against their own countrymen in the entente called `` the Fre - donian War . ''

		It was of course inevitable that the prosper - ity and the ominous increase of the American colonies should arouse the jealousy of the Mex - icans ; and it may be admitted that it was equally inevitable that the colonists , on their side , should feel growing aspirations toward in - dependence , and growing contempt for the weather-cock government at the capitol , that had become the prey of successive military adventurers .

		In
1830	DATE	they were driven to open revolt by the edicts of
Bustamente	PERSON	, a sanguinary tyrant representing the centralist and anti-liberal party , who , among other abuses of his spurious authority , began preparations for
Mexicanizing Texas	LOCATION	by sending a thousand soldiers , mostly criminals and convicts , to sta - tions in the country .

		Bustamente was soon overthrown by the irrepressible
Santa Anna	LOCATION	, the stormy petrel of Mexican politics .

		But his system of oppression was continued by his suc - cessors ; and it culminated in the tyrannical decree of
1834	DATE	, by which the Texan settlers were ordered to give up their arms about tantamount , under the prevailing conditions , to ordering them to give up their lives .

		To such a demand there could be but one reply .

		It was given in no equivocal terms ; and the issue between
Mexico	LOCATION	and her Anglo-American citizens was finally decided in favor of the lat - ter on the field of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	.

		That the flame of revolt was fanned from the first by uneasy spirits from over the border , men who , like the Bowies ,
Crockett	PERSON	, and
Travis	PERSON	, had no wrongs to redress and no ends to serve but those of personal ambition or thirst for adventure , there is no doubt .

		As the trouble thickened , the fili - bustering element increased .

		The vastness of the prize at stake , an area of 268,684 square miles , with almost boundless territorial possi - bilities to the westward , made it impossible that the quarrel should be confined to its relatively insignificant principals .

		Sam
Houston	LOCATION	went to
Texas	LOCATION	late in
1832	DATE	, ostensibly on a mission to the Comanche Indians .

		That he was really a secret emissary of President
Jackson	PERSON	, charged with the duty of feeling the political pulse of the incensed colonists , is evident in the follow - ing letter to his chief written shortly after his arrival : `` Having been as far as Bexar in the province of
Texas	LOCATION	, where I had an interview with the Comanche Indians , I am in possession of some information which will doubtless be interesting to you , and may be calcu - lated to forward your views , if you should entertain
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 any , touching the acquisition of
Texas	LOCATION	by the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		That such a measure is desired by nineteen-twentieths of the population of the province , I can not doubt .

		They are now without laws to govern or protect them .

		Mexico is involved in civil war .

		The
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	has never been in operation .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	is essentially despotic , and must be so for years to come .

		The rulers have not honesty , and the people have not intelligence .

		The people of
Texas	LOCATION	are determined to form a state government , and unless
Mexico	LOCATION	is soon restored to order , and the Constitution revived and reenacted , the province of
Texas	LOCATION	will remain separate from the Confederacy of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		She has already beaten and repelled all the troops of
Mexico	LOCATION	from her soil , nor will she permit them to return .

		Her want of money , taken in connection with the course
Texas	LOCATION	must and will adopt , will render the transfer of
Texas	LOCATION	to some power inevitable , and , if the
United States	LOCATION	does not press for it ,
England	LOCATION	will most assuredly ob - tain it by some means ...
England	LOCATION	is pressing her suit for it , but its citizens will resist , if any transfer is made of them to any power but the
United States	LOCATION	... My opinion is that
Texas	LOCATION	, by her members in conven - tion , will , by the first of
April	DATE	, declare all that country -LSB- east of the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	-RSB- as
Texas	LOCATION	proper , and form a
State Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		I expect to be present at the Convention , and will apprise you of the course adopted as soon as the members have taken a final action .

		It is probable that I may make
Texas	LOCATION	my abiding-place .

		In adopting this course / will never forget the country of my birth .

		... '' The real object of
Houston	LOCATION	's mission to
Texas	LOCATION	did not long remain a secret .


G. W. Feather	PERSON	- stonehaugh , an English traveller who came across him at the little village of
Washington	LOCATION	, notes in his book , '' A Journey through the Slave States '' : `` General
Houston	LOCATION	was here , leading a mysterious sort of life , shut up in a small tavern , seeing nobody by day , and sitting up all night .

		The world gave him credit for passing his waking hours in the study of trente et quarante , and sept a lever , but I had been in communication with too many persons of late , and had seen too much passing before my eyes , to be ignorant that the little place was the rendezvous where a much deeper game than faro or rouge et noir was being played . ''

		Upon the rich fund of characteristic stories extant of
Houston	LOCATION	, our author has drawn lib - erally .

		Many of these turn upon his fondness for striking and histrionic effects , especially in the matter of costume .

		When elected Gov - ernor of
Tennessee	LOCATION	in
1827	DATE	the future Hero of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	appeared at the polls in a garb that would certainly call down popular vengeance upon the most '' magnetic '' modern candidate .

		He wore , says Col.
Claiborne	PERSON	, 41 A tall , bell-crowned , medium-brimmed , shining black beaver hat , shining black patent-leather stock or cravat , incased by a standing collar , ruffled shirt , black satin vest , shining black silk pants gathered to the waistband with legs full , same size from seat to ankle , and a gor - geous , red-ground , many-colored gown or Indian hunt - ing-shirt , fastened at the waist by a huge red sash cov - ered with fancy bead-work , with an immense silver buckle , embroidered silk stockings , and pumps with large silver buckles .

		Mounted on a superb dapple-gray horse he appeared at the election unannounced , and was the observed of all observers . ''

		As President of
Texas	LOCATION	,
Houston	LOCATION	is reported to have worn a sort of state robe of velvet , ex - changed , on minor occasions , for a '' fancy vel - vet coat and trousers '' plentifully trimmed with gold lace .

		He once presented himself to
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary of War
Calhoun	PERSON	in
Washington	LOCATION	in the garb of an Indian chief and was very prop - erly rebuked for the impropriety .

		The most striking description of
Houston	LOCATION	is that given by
Oliver Dyer	PERSON	, who saw him in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		He was then fifty-five years of age : '' He was a magnificent barbarian , somewhat tempered with civilization .

		He was large of frame , of stately car - riage and dignified demeanor , and had a lion-like coun - tenance , capable of expressing the fiercest passions .

		His dress was peculiar , but it was becoming to his style .

		The conspicuous features of it were a military cap and short military cloak of fine blue broadcloth with a blood - red lining .

		Afterward I occasionally met him when he wore a vast and picturesque sombrero and a Mexican blanket a sort of ornamental bed-quilt , with a slit in the middle , through which the wearer 's head is thrust , leaving the blanket to hang in graceful folds around the body ... His principal employment in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was whittling pine sticks .

		I used to wonder where he got his pine lumber , but never fathomed the mystery .

		He would sit and whittle away , and at the same time keep up a muttering of discontent at the long-winded speakers , whom he would sometimes curse for their in - tolerable verbosity ...
General Houston	ORGANIZATION	impressed me as a lonely , melancholy man .

		And if the story of his early life was true he might well be lonely and mel - ancholy in spite of his success and his fame ; for that blow which smote him to the heart at the zenith of his splendid young career , and dislocated his life and drove him into the wilderness , must have inflicted wounds that no political triumphs or military glory could heal . ''

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's story of the Texan war , of the Alamo tragedy , the massacre at
Goliad	LOCATION	, and the fight at
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, is extremely spir - ited and graphic .

		We shall close our extracts with the following account of the capture of
Santa Anna	LOCATION	and his meeting with
Houston	LOCATION	after
San Jacinto	LOCATION	. ''


Houston	LOCATION	had prophesied that
Santa Anna	LOCATION	would be found making his retreat on all fours , and in the dress of a common soldier .

		About two o'clock a little man was brought in behind a soldier on horseback .

		His restless eyes and pallid countenance indicated that he was suffering from great fear .

		He was dressed in linen trousers , a blue cotton jacket , a cap , and red worsted slippers .

		The Mexican soldiers , on seeing him , ex - claimed , ' El Presidente !

		El
General Santa Anna !	ORGANIZATION	'

		.


Santa Anna	LOCATION	was brought into the presence of
Houston	LOCATION	, who was lying on his pallet in a doze , having been kept awake during the
night	TIME	from the pain of his wound .


Houston	LOCATION	was not much more distinguished in dress than his captive .

		His dandyism had given way to the exigencies of the campaign , and he wore an old 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, black coat , a black velvet vest , a pair of snuff-colored pantaloons , and dilapidated boots .

		His only badge of authority during the campaign was a sword with a plated scabbard , which he tied to his belt with buck - skin thongs .

		Santa Anna stepped forward , and said , with an impressive bow , ' I am
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna	ORGANIZATION	, President of the Mexican Republic , and I claim to be a prisoner of war at your disposal . '

		Hous - ton waved his hand for him to be seated on an ammuni - tion box , and Colonel
Almonte	PERSON	was sent for to act as interpreter .

		While waiting his arrival ,
Santa Anna	LOCATION	pressed his hands to his sides as if in pain or fear , and his restless black eyes glanced round the camp .

		When
Almonte	PERSON	came up
Santa Anna	LOCATION	complained of pain , and asked for a piece of opium .

		A piece of about five grains was given him , and he regained something of his composure .

		His first words were , ' That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has con - quered the
Napoleon	PERSON	of the
West	LOCATION	.

		It now remains for him to be generous to the vanquished . '

		Houston replied , ' You should have remembered that at the
Alamo	LOCATION	. ' ''

		It is almost with regret that one records that this inhuman butcher and born scoundrel , with his '' Old
Bailey	PERSON	countenance '' and his worse than Old
Bailey	PERSON	record , was shielded by Hous - ton from the fury of his captors .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has given us a useful book a good historical monograph , and a discrim - inating account of a public man whose memory has suffered about equally from fulsome eulogy and unjust detraction .

		Manor , '' by Prof.
Andrews	PERSON	, of
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	Col - lege ; '' The Agricultural Laborer , '' by Mr.
Kebbel	PERSON	, which is but a reprint of the well - known and valuable edition of
1887	DATE	; '' The Condition of the Western Farmer , '' by
Arthur F. Bentley	PERSON	; and the '' Economics of the Rus - sian Village , '' by Dr.
T. A. Hourwich	PERSON	, Instruc - tor of Statistics at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	's work has a valuable Introduc - tion upon the conflicting theories of the origin of the
Marc System	ORGANIZATION	.

		He neither accepts the theory of absolute democracy , with an elected chieftain among the Anglo-Saxon immigrants into
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the fifth century , nor does he accept the opposite theory of the com - munity being composed of a lord and his ten - ants , but takes a quite sensible position that the chieftainship was hereditary and the mass of the community were free , while there were also some slaves .

		The greater portion of the book is occupied in an interesting detailed study of the methods of land-holding , tillage , and home life of the Anglo-Saxon village as it was in the tenth century , a little before the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same conditions are held , however , to have continued almost un - changed for three or four centuries after the Conquest .

		Anyone interested in this subject will find the book an admirable guide , full of references to original authorities .

		The work of Mr.
T. E. Kebbel	PERSON	, an English lawyer , has been accepted by all parties of En - gland , since the appearance of the first edition in
1870	DATE	and the second edition in
1887	DATE	, as thoroughly reliable , but written from the Tory standpoint .

		Mr.
Kebbel	PERSON	holds , and others generally admit , that compulsory education , when continued until the child is twelve or thirteen , has stimulated the ambition of the agricultural population to seek better opportu - nities or greater social pleasures in towns and cities , and has left the English farmer with only the unprogressive laborers .

		Thus , educa - tion has not apparently thus far been any help to the English farmer , while it has undoubt - edly elevated the laborer .

		Mr.
Kebbel	PERSON	shows that English education , like much American , might serve a more valuable purpose if it had more of manual training and of relation to the work of after life .

		It appears that while wages have somewhat risen , yet
four dollars	MONEY	a week and a cottage is about all an English laborer can secure for his work .

		But the earnings of his wife , and children over twelve , supple - ment this to a considerable degree .

		Wages , measured in purchasing power , are somewhat
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 higher than in
1870	DATE	; yet the attempt of Mr.
Arch	PERSON	to organize a trade-union of farm la - borers has broken down , and some of the rise in wages which he at one time helped to se - cure has disappeared .

		Drinking appears to be very common among the farm laborers and also among the farmers .

		Mr.
Kebbel	PERSON	agrees with Prof.
Marshall	PERSON	and many other English investigators , that for
England	LOCATION	large farms are probably better than small ones , but that the artificial restrictions that now exist on the pur - chase of small farms , because of the legal dif - ficulties of securing a title , should be removed .

		The general impression obtained from Mr.
Keb	PERSON	- bel 's book is of the extreme unprogressiveness of the English agricultural laborer as con - trasted with our own . ''

		The Condition of the Western Farmer as illustrated by the
Economic History	ORGANIZATION	of a Ne - braska Township '' is a most valuable study of a typical
Nebraska	LOCATION	farming community in the central-eastern part of the state , where droughts have not been very great .

		The economic his - tory of every one of the nearly two hundred families that have owned farms since the set - tlement of the township , in
1872	DATE	, has been carefully investigated and is here presented .

		It is shown that those who secured their land almost free from the Government are fairly prosperous , those that bought their land from the railroad -LRB- the
Union Pacific	LOCATION	-RRB- are less so , and those that bought their land from the first private owners are scarcely able to make a liv - ing ; and that , on the whole , it seems harder to get ahead now than it was years ago .

		With - out entering upon the possible relation of the money problem to the case , the author endeav - ors to present such local and at least partial causes as he finds .

		One cause is that early settlers could sell their crops at good prices to later settlers , while the latter were waiting for their own crops to grow .

		The early settlers could also sell at good prices to the workers who were constructing railroads through that part of the state .

		But now these demands have fallen off , and the crop must be sold in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in competition with many other lands , and after paying freight rates for long dis - tances .

		Then , too , the development of a set - tled community makes it unpopular and almost ignoble to live in the same kind of a dug-out and with the same lack of the somewhat ex - pensive comforts of civilization that the early isolated settlers endured .

		Finally , the knowl - edge of the changed conditions has not suffi - ciently reached the would-be settler of the
East	LOCATION	, who therefore pays more for land than the in - come from it will justify .

		Such studies as this by Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	, who is a graduate student in .

		History and
Political Science	ORGANIZATION	at Johns Hop - kins
University	ORGANIZATION	, should be made in hundreds - of places throughout the entire country .

		Dr.
Hourwich	PERSON	, a recent Fellow in
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, and now placed in charge of the De - partment of Statistics in the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , has in his work on '' The Economics of the Russian Village '' given us a careful study of the results of a series of official censuses of the industrial conditions of two districts con - sidered typical in middle
Russia	LOCATION	, directly in the neighborhood of the home of
Leo TolstoiV	PERSON	about two hundred miles south of
Moscow	LOCATION	, and in the heart of the recent famine .

		The fact & quoted seem to show that instead of the Russian mir , or village , being able to preserve its systent of communal land-holding , as was fondly hoped by a large number of Russian writers , the mir is gradually changing into a village of individ - ual land-holders .

		The wage-system is fast de - veloping , and the small peasant holders who - succeeded the serfs have such poor methods of farming , and such wretched implements , that they are being gradually driven to the wall , as are the large land-holding nobles , by a new class of large land-holding capitalists .

		These latter are introducing improved ploughs , fertil - izers , etc. , and give promise of ultimately dom - inating Russian agriculture , as has happened in
England	LOCATION	.

		This will increase the ability of
Russia	LOCATION	to compete with American agriculture .

		It is only on these growing capitalists ' estates that the yield per acre to-day is equal to th & American .

		It would be helpful to the reader if Dr.
Hourwich	PERSON	had not assumed quite as much knowledge as he does , on the part of his read - ers , of Russian economic terms or modes of in - dustrial activity , though it is not difficult in most cases to follow him .

		Professor
Ashley	PERSON	, formerly of
England	LOCATION	and now of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, has given us th & continuation of his first volume on English Eco - nomic History , in a work much larger than the former .

		This new work , covering the End of the Middle Ages , together with Professor
Cun	PERSON	- ningham 's '' Growth of English Industry and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	'' and Mr.
W. C. Taylor	PERSON	's '' Mod - ern Factory System , '' correct a very optimistic view of the condition of the English Mediaeval workman given by
Thorold Rogers	PERSON	.

		It is now considered very doubtful , certainly unproved , that any eight-hour work-day was general in
England	LOCATION	in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen - 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, turies .

		The idea that the acknowledged fall in the condition of the English workman in the sixteenth century can not be traced to any distinct conspiracy of the landlord class , or of the king , has also met with a severe blow in these works .

		Professor
Ashley	PERSON	shows that the confiscation of the revenues of the guilds did not seriously entrench upon such revenues as were set apart in the sixteenth century for the actual economic needs of the members , but re - lated almost entirely to funds devoted to relig - ious uses , and confiscation of the monastery funds somewhat hastened the need of a poor - law ; but it is shown that in all cases , both Prot - estant and Catholic writers were becoming con - vinced that the monasteries , by their indiscrim - inate giving , pauperized quite as much as helped , and that state supervision was an im - provement over the monastery methods .

		This book of Professor
Ashley	PERSON	's gives the best ac - count of the guilds , in the short compass of a hundred pages , that has thus far appeared .

		They are held , on the whole , to have been a very beneficial institution .

		This is also true of the considerable state activity that existed in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		It is probable that if the present tendency to form trusts and monopolies continues we shall find ourselves forced to in - troduce as much public supervision , if not of precisely the same kind , as was had in the Mid - dle Ages in all of
Western Europe	LOCATION	when the
State	ORGANIZATION	controlled wages , prices , and the quality of goods , and even owned and managed flour - mills .

		`` The Inheritance Tax , '' by Dr.
Max West	PERSON	, is one of the best economic monographs that it has been the reviewer 's good fortune to exam - ine for a long while .

		At this time , when the question of an inheritance tax is attracting so much favorable interest , and so many of our states are beginning to experiment with it , it is of great public advantage to have presented , in the clear way that Dr. West has done , a brief history and the present condition of the inheritance tax in all parts of
Europe	LOCATION	,
Austral	LOCATION	- asia , and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This is followed by a discussion of the theory of the matter , and of the decisions of our courts , in the main up - holding the tax .

		The question is also consid - ered as to whether the tax should be progress - ive , increasing with the magnitude of the estate and with the distance of relationship of those inheriting .

		It may be said that Dr. West finds that experience in general has been favorable to the tax even in its progressive form , and that it is probable that in time many of our Amer - ican states will secure nearly , if not quite , their entire state revenue in this way , and that the national government also , as to some degree in the Civil War , will fall back upon it in time of crises , leaving to counties , townships , and cities revenue from licenses and the taxation of real-estate .

		Mr.
James Bonar	PERSON	, already favorably known for his admirable little book on
Malthus	PERSON	, has in his '' Philosophy and Political Economy '' shown the gradual development of philosoph - ical conceptions which have greatly influenced economic thought and activity .

		The goal now reached is that every one born into this world has the right to ask of society the opportunity for the harmonious development of all his pow - ers , while at the same time men will never sell their liberty to purchase a compulsory equality and fraternity .

		In More 's '' Utopia '' is first discovered the demand for the improvement of the outward conditions , not of the few , but of all .


Krause	PERSON	, the German philosopher of the first third of this century , is held to have first clearly taught that natural right is a claim for the conditions that make a rational human life possible .

		Very truly is it declared that the great work of socialism has been the emphasiz - ing of this idea , and the proof that the major portion of mankind do not now have , as they should , this opportunity of developing what is in them .

		Beginning with
Plato	PERSON	and ending with Mill ,
Kant	PERSON	,
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	,
Krause	PERSON	,
Hegel	PERSON	, and the socialists
Marx	PERSON	,
Engels	LOCATION	,
Lassalle	LOCATION	, the wri - ter sketches the development of the economic view of history , and such theories as property , natural rights , and the functions of the state .

		This work , however , is in many places obscure , and not equal to the author 's other writings .

		In his '' Housing of the Poor , '' a prize essay of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	gives a brief account of the leading efforts of philanthropists in
London	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	to build cheap yet good tenements for the poor .

		Plans of model tenements are given .

		The sanitary laws of
New York	LOCATION	, pro- nounced the best in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, are summarized ; but the author , in referring to the tendency of many of the poor to soon de - grade even the best tenements , does not seem appreciative of how efficient a remedy would lie in a well-enforced requirement that every tenement house containing over two tenements should have a responsible janitor to see to such matters .

		Just as in
Boston	LOCATION	no clothing can be made in a tenement without a license , which is given only on proof of excellent sanitary con -

		THE DIAL 263 ditions , so there might be required a similar license for residence .

		On the whole , however , the monograph is a valuable study of the im - portant subject treated .

		In his '' Introduction to the Study of the De - pendent , Defective , and Delinquent Classes , '' Dr.
Charles R. Henderson	PERSON	, of the
Sociological Department of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, pre - sents a carefully chosen summary of the diverse opinions of scientific writers upon the causes , nature , and remedies of pauperism , insanity , crime , and affiliated evils .

		The topical method of presentation , and the full lists of authori - ties on every point , joined to brief comments by the writer , will make the book useful for students as all should be of these social problems .

		In '' The New Reformation , '' Mr.
Ramsden Balmforth	PERSON	, from somewhat the standpoint of our ethical culture societies , makes a strong appeal to us to follow out the ideas of
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and find our highest duty in securing juster and more equal opportunities for true living to the humanity about us .

		Whatever one may think of the au - thor 's views of orthodox Christianity , everyone must admit the supreme duty and need , too often as yet unrealized , of securing far greater justice and humanity in social conditions .

		It is an interesting evidence of the position fast being taken by the new
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , that of the ten writers in economic and social science whose works are included in this review , three Messrs.
Hourwich	PERSON	,
Henderson	PERSON	, and West are now connected with this Uni - versity .

		: A CHARACTER STUDY .

		* No man more sincerely than
Abraham Lin	PERSON	- coln would have chosen for a biographer one who would '' nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice . ''

		Yet it has not been his good - fortune hitherto to find such a relator of his life .

		Whilst he has escaped in a large degree malicious misrepresentation , he has in the main fallen into the hands of men lacking the his - torical faculty , who have followed along the lines of the '' campaign '' life .

John T. Morse	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Two vol - umes . ''

		American Statesmen '' series .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		rian as a true picture of the greatest American .

		The state of mind of its makers is many times as much like that of the famous
Mason Weems	PERSON	as can be possible to any mind in the nine - teenth century .

		It has been reserved for Mr.
John T. Morse	PERSON	to write the first serious esti - mate of the life and character of
Lincoln	LOCATION	; for whilst he has not made the ideal book which we all look for but never see , he has grasped the personality of one of the most individual men of any age .

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	sets forth in a masterly manner the unique combination of characteristics , so well known and yet so little understood .

		Nowhere does Mr.
Morse	PERSON	show his phil - osophic insight better than where he character - izes as '' the preeminently striking feature in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's nature , '' '' the extraordinary degree to which he always appeared to be in close and sympathetic touch with the people , that is to say the people in the mass wherein he was im - bedded , the social body amid which he dwelt , which pressed upon him on all sides , which for him formed ' the public . ' ''

		And he adds : '' The very quality which made Lincoln , as a young man , not much superior to his coarse surroundings , was precisely the same quality which , ripening and expand - ing rapidly and grandly with maturing years and a greater circle of humanity , made him what he was in later life .

		It is through this quality that we get con - tinuity in him ; without it , we can not evade the insolu - ble problem of two men two lives one following the other with no visible link of connection between them ; without it we have physically one creature , morally and mentally two beings .

		If we reject this trait , we throw away the only key which unlocks the problem of the most singular life , taken from end to end , which has ever been witnessed among men , a life which many have been content to regard as an unsolved enigma . ''

		Speaking of the constitutional tendency to gloom which afflicted Lincoln through life , the author suggests a partial explanation of it when he says : '' It is well known that the coarse and rough side of life among the pioneers had its reaction in a reserved and at times morose habit , nearly akin to sadness , at least in those who frequented the wilderness ; it was the ex - pression of the influence of the vast , desolate , and lonely nature amid which they passed their lives .

		The shud - dering awe and terrible sense of fate , which the grandeur of the Greek tragedies so powerfully expresses , come to us when we contemplate this strange cloud which never left Lincoln in any year after his earliest youth , although some traits in his character seemed often incomprehen - sibly to violate it , and , like rebellious spirits , to do out - rage to it , while in fact they only made it the more striking , picturesque , and mysterious . ''

		In another fine passage in volume one we have a diagnosis of that remarkable lack of animosity in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's nature which makes pos - 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, .

		sible the statement that although , in the dis - cussion of slavery , `` he was dealing with a question which was arousing personal antag - onisms as bitter as any that history records , yet he never condemned anyone , nor ever passed judgment against his fellow-men . ''

		The author believes this a mental rather than a moral trait , and finds its root '' not so much in human charity as in fairness of thinking . ''

		In any event it marked him as the one man of large magnanimity who , as a civilian , bore a con - spicuous part in the Rebellion period .

		It lifted him above the bickerings of party strife , and enabled him to live calmly and serenely in the daily presence of men of such virulent animos - ities as
Edwin M. Stanton	PERSON	, and finally to sway all to his own unselfish purposes .

		For another trait , equally conspicuous amid those stormy days from
1850	DATE	to
1865	DATE	, was '' his entire political unselfishness , the rarest moral quality among men in public life . ''

		Out of a time when selfish ambitions and place-seeking and intrigue were too common for us to con - template contentedly , and when slanders and cruel aspersions were the lot of many who tried to do their duty , the reputation of this man has come as of one who rose above every unworthy ambition and every personal meanness to the one thought that filled his four years of office : that the Nation was a trust in his hands , to be saved from its enemies , even sometimes in spite of the step-motherly efforts of its friends . ''

		Not the faintest shadow of self ever fell for an in - stant across this simple purpose .

		He was intent to play his part out faithfully , with all the ability he could bring to it ; but anyone else who could might win and wear the title of savior .

		He chiefly cared that the saving should be done .

		Never once did he manipulate any court magnet to draw toward himself the credit or the glory of a measure or a move .

		To his own future he seemed to give no thought . ''

		This magnanimity was not only conspicuous as regarded himself : it was manifested in all his utterances of a personal nature .

		The au - thor emphasizes the fact that seldom if ever in his public career did he utter criticism of any man 's character or motives .

		No man stands in the pages of history stained by his aspersions or even pilloried by his just denunciations .

		Not even when one like
McClellan	PERSON	, writhing under a sense of abandonment in the crisis of his campaign , denounced him bitterly to his face , did he strike back .

		He seemed to take hold on the part of each man 's conduct which ap - proached nearest to his own patriotic endeavor , and to put out of sight forever all that savored of the earthy .

		Consequently he gathered out of the great seething mass of mixed motives that surrounded him all that was worthiest and noblest , and concentred it for the salvation of the nation .

		Regardless of what a man 's per - sonal abuse of himself had been as in the case of
Stanton	PERSON	he took cordially every true effort that came to him , and built it into the one con - trolling purpose .

		We have confined our review to that portion of Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's work which deals with Lin - coln 's personality , because we believe that this is its distinct contribution to the literature of the theme .

		Yet as much space might have been given to the admirable treatment of some of the historic controversies of the War period .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's justification in the matter of
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	is well set out .

		The McClellan imbroglio is handled with clear discrimination , which recognizes the many abilities of that ill - starred general , while making manifest his one fatal weakness .

		The difficult subject of Re - construction is discussed with a calm display of the pros and cons of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's policy , which leaves one more than ever convinced that only his large heart and clear brain could have carried out such a policy .

		It seems ungracious to say anything in way of censure of so meritorious a work , but there are errors of expression which mar somewhat a very welcome narrative .

		To score a point in favor of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's modesty , it was not necessary to impute to his predecessors '' generally '' words used only by one of them .

		The narrative does not gain vividness by call - ing
Horace Greeley	PERSON	'' woolly-witted . ''

		There is a small pedantry which surprises us in so phil - osophic a historian , in more than once correct - ing Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's `` would '' to , '' -LSB- should -RSB- . ''

		This is an indignity which will not help the cause of correct grammar .

		There is a pecul - iar atrocity in dressing out once more the dis - carded petticoat-story about Mr.
Davis	PERSON	for the purpose of suggesting that by his tragic death '' Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was robbed of the amusement which he would have gathered from this ex - ploit . ''

		Such cheap wit in the presence of the mighty dead should be expunged from a later edition .

		THE DIAL 26 RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY .

		* The dainty little volumes into which Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	is wont to collect his poems have long been favor - ites with the book-lover .

		There are five of them now , and '' The Great Remembrance '' is by no means the least of the five , although its contents are chiefly poems of persons and occasions .

		The title poem is certainly one of the best commemorat - ive pieces that the inspiration of the Civil War has evoked .

		`` So long ago it was , '' and yet the mem - ory of it can still impel to such verse as this : '' So long ago it was , so long ago , All , all have passed ; the terror and the splendor Have turned like yesterevening 's stormy glow Into a sunset memory strange and tender .

		How beautiful it seems , what lordly sights , What deeds sublime , what wondrous days and nights , What love of comrades , ay , what quickened breath , When first we knew that , startled , quailing , still We too , even we , along the blazing hill We , with the best , could face and conquer death . ''

		` There is a touch of
Lowell	LOCATION	in this fine passage : '' Dear Country !

		Thou Art still our passion ; still to thee we bow In love supreme !

		Fairer than e'er before Art thou to-day from golden shore to shore The home of freemen .

		Not one stain doth cling Now to thy banner .

		Argosies of war On thy imperial rivers bravely fling Flags of the nations , but no message bring Save of peace only ; while , behold , from far The Old World comes to greet thy natal star That with the circling century returns , And in the Western heavens with fourfold beauty burns . ''

		Lowell himself is the subject of one of Mr.

		Thou didst love as a strong man loveth the maiden he woos , Not the woman he toys with , and sings to , and , passing , for - gets , Whom he woos , whom he wins , whom he weds , his passion , his pride , Who no shadow of wrong shall suffer , who shall stand in his sight Pure as the sky of the evil her foeman may threat , Save by word or by thought of her own in her whiteness un - touched , And wounded alone of the lightning her spirit engenders . ''

		Few writers have Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's power to seize the poetry of the mood or of the passing moment , and to fix it with unpremeditated art .

		His verse-forms are often wayward ; their spontaneity must be the excuse for their license .

		Another marked charac - teristic is his command of the imagery of the skies , recalling Shelley in its pervasive quality and haunt - ing effect .

		How exquisitely he can use such imagery may be shown by the lines to '' Evening in
Tyring	LOCATION	- ham Valley . '' ''

		What domes and pinnacles of mist and fire Are builded in yon spacious realms of light All silently , as did the walls aspire Templing the ark of God by day and night .

		Noiseless and swift , from darkening ridge to ridge , Through purple air that deepens down the day , Over the valley springs a shadowy bridge .

		The evening star 's keen , solitary ray Makes more intense the silence , and the glad ,
Unmelancholy	LOCATION	, restful , twilight gloom , So full of tenderness , that even the sad Remembrances that haunt the soul take bloom Like that on yonder mountain .

		Now the bars Of sunset all burn black ; the day doth fail , And the skies whiten with the eternal stars .

		Oh , let thy spirit stay with me , sweet vale ! ''

		This volume contains also Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's three poems suggested by the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, one of the three , as our readers will remember , having made its first appearance in THE DIAL , and another of them having been included in its recent World 's Fair symposium . ''

		For Fifty Years '' Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	has been writing occasional verses , and some of his friends have recently insisted upon having the scat - tered pieces collected and printed .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	pro- vides the title-page with an appropriate motto from the '' Memoir of
Frederic Ingham	PERSON	'' : '' If it were his duty to write verses , he wrote verses ; to fight slavers , he fought slavers ; to write sermons , he wrote sermons ; and he did one of these things with just as much alacrity as another . ''

		We have no doubt that Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's verses were written with '' alacrity '' ; they are sparks struck from a much belabored anvil , and , like his sermons , histories , and novels , reveal the warm-hearted and forceful person - ality of their writer .

		There are some rough and spir - ited ballads -LRB- which turn out to be pointed anecdotes told in rugged rhyme -RRB- , groups of college and war pieces , a few translations , some versified conclusions of sermons -LRB- following , we are told , the excellent ex - ample of Dr.
Doddridge	PERSON	-RRB- , and a miscellaneous sec - tion .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	quotes a Spanish proverb to the effect that '' Every one who is not a fool has writ - 266 -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ten two sonnets , '' and to prove -LRB- quite unnecessarily -RRB- that he is not a fool , he gives us three , one of which we reproduce as a characteristic specimen of his work .

		Its subject is '' the ship which brought a copy of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's statue of Christ from
Italy	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Bark after bark has sunk in gales like these , Facing the jealous West , as thou dost now .

		Still thou must breast each wave , nor shun the seas , Which beetle downward on thy westward prow .

		The great ' Christ-bearer ' quailed not : he , as thou ,
Left Italy	LOCATION	to seek our Western shore ; And as another dove another olive bore , Seeing across the waste another promise-bow .

		Beat westward still !

		beat downward every wave !

		The Christ who gave our New World to the Old , E'en then his secret to his
Michael	PERSON	told , And to his eye the sacred vision gave .

		Beat the waves down !

		let them his form behold Who are his ' other sheep , ' not of his early fold . ''

		Three of these verses have superfluous feet , but Dr.
Hale	PERSON	does not mind a little thing like that , and his countless friends and well-wishers would forgive far more serious offences .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's new volume of poems is thin only as a matter of physical measurement .

		In quality it is compact and exquisite , while imitative in but slight degree .

		Its originality is sometimes gained at the cost of a forced verbalism , and its compres - sion sometimes results in obscurity ; but we may well put up with a few imperfections in verse that is so much more than a mere echo .

		The author 's qual - ities -LRB- and their defects -RRB- are well illustrated in '' The Kings '' : `` A man said unto his angel : ' My spirits are fallen thro ' , And I can not carry this battle ; brother !

		what shall I do ? ' '

		The terrible Kings are on me , With spears that are deadly bright , Against me so from the cradle Do fate and my fathers fight . ' ''

		Then said to the man his angel : ' Thou wavering , foolish soul , Back to the ranks !

		What matter To win or to lose the whole , `` As judged by the little judges Who hearken not well , nor see ?

		Not thus , by the outer issue , The Wise shall interpret thee . ' '

		Thy will is the very , the only , The solemn event of things ; The weakest of hearts defying Is stronger than all these Kings .

		`` Tho ' out of the past they gather Mind 's Doubt and Bodily Pain , And pallid Thirst of the Spirit That is kin to the other twain , And Grief , in a cloud of banners , And ringletted Vain Desires , And Vice , with the spoils upon him Of thee and thy beaten sires , ' ' While kings of eternal evil Yet darken the hills about , Thy part is with broken sabre To rise on the last redoubt ; ' ' To fear not sensible failure , Nor covet the game at all , But fighting , fighting , fighting , Die , driven against the wall ! ' ''

		A comparison of this poem with Arnold 's '' The - Last Word , '' not unlike it in theme , or even with Sill 's '' Opportunity , '' will show that it loses some - thing by such phrases as '' the outer issue , '' '' sen - sible failure , '' and '' The very , the only , The solemn event of things , '' and something more , possibly , by over-elaboration of the allegory ; but it remains an impressive piece of work .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's remarkable lyrical faculty may be illustrated from the verses to '' Hylas '' : '' Fathoms low , the naiads sing In a birthday welcoming ; Water-white their breasts , and o'er him Water-gray , their eyes adore him .

		-LRB- There 's a bird on the under bough Fluting evermore and now : ' Keep young ! '

		but who knows how ? -RRB- ''

		or by these from '' The Still of the Year '' : `` Sweet is cherry-time , sweet A shower , a bobolink , And the little trillium-blossom Tucked under her leaf to think ; But here in the vast unborn Is the bitterest place to be , Till striving and longing Shall quicken the earth and me .

		What change inscrutable Is nigh us , we know not well ; Gone is the strength to sigh , Either to live or die .

		Heigho !

		my heart 's sick . ''

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's sonnets are as I 'em arkable as her lyr - ics and ballads .

		Here is the beautiful close of the - sonnet upon an old Italian Madonna : '' As up a wayside , after rain , When the blown beeches purple all the height And clouds sink to the sea-marge , suddenly The autumn sun -LRB- how soft , how solemn-bright ! -RRB-

		Moves to the vacant dial , so is lain God 's meaning Hand , thou chosen , upon thee . ''

		This simile might be matched -LRB- if there were any use in matching things -RRB- with some of the finer sim - iles in
Bossetti	LOCATION	; and the group of
London	LOCATION	sonnets , in their revelation of the poetic aspects of the
Great City	LOCATION	, with Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's recent verses upon that perilous theme .

		Here is a picture of
London	LOCATION	by gaslight : '' Full as a marsh of mist and winking light ; Heaven thickens over , Heaven that can not cure Her tear by day , her fevered smile by night . ''

		Even a
London	LOCATION	fog has its poetry -LRB- as Mr.
Henley	PERSON	also discovered -RRB- : '' Like bodiless water passing in a sigh , Thro ' palsied streets the fatal shadows flow , And in their sharp disastrous undertow Suck in the morning sun , and all the sky . ''

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's work tempts to quotation , but one more example must suffice the stanzas to the mem - ory of Dr.
Parsons	PERSON	:
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 '' Friend who hast gone , and dost enrich to-day
New England	LOCATION	brightly building far away , And crown her liberal walk With company more choice , and sweeter talk , '' Look not on Fame , but Peace ; and in a bower Receive at last her fulness and her power : Nor wholly , pure of heart , Forget thy few , who would be where thou art . ''

		So graceful and touching a tribute is not often paid to the illustrious dead .

		Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	's verses are of the unpretentious , old-fashioned , homely sort , smooth in measure and wholesome in sentiment , mostly written in sincerely pious vein .

		A couple of stanzas from '' The Annun - ciation '' are fairly representative . ''

		With grave eyes rapt in dreams of prayer , She sits alone within the room , Unheeding if around her there Be golden ray or deepening gloom .

		Her heart uplifted , silent , sweet , Her thought goes forth her Lord to greet . ''

		And thus attent before the
King	PERSON	, No sense of strangeness startles her When one from heaven draws near to bring A sign to
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's worshipper . '

		Hail ,
Mary !	PERSON	'

		fills her soul with bliss , Her tranquil years have waited this . ''

		The verses in this volume have all been collected from various periodicals .


Madame Darmesteter	ORGANIZATION	's new volume affords glimpses of a life varied in experience , both object - ive and subjective , of a mind that has borne the full stress of modern thought , and of a heart that , unchanged by new appeals , still recurs to the famil - iar themes endeared by early association .

		There are lyrics and ballads and sonnets ; lyrics with a touch of melancholy , ballads of terse dramatic force , and sonnets of the life of culture and intellectual preoccupation .

		The verses on u Le Roc-du-Chere , '' where Taine is buried , and the other verses bearing '' Veritatem Dilexi ''
Kenan	PERSON	's motto for a title , pay rich and merited tribute to the two men whose recent death has left the world so poor .

		We quote the former piece : '' High on the heathery hill-brow o'er the lake , White as a temple gleams the tomb afar .

		Shine on , shine on even as a guiding star , And let our souls be nobler for thy sake .

		`` He whom we leave amid the rocks and winds Tower 'd in our midst , a conscience to us all .

		We look 'd at him and fought , and dared not fall , But faced the truth in front with honest minds . ''

		passionate and loyal Spirit of Life That spake so true and firm thro ' doubt and pain .

		large and grand and simple soul of
Taine	LOCATION	, Be to us still our standard in the strife ; '' Pure as the welling waters of thy wave , And mighty as the mountains of thy rest , Indomitable as yonder eagled crest , And lowly as these grasses round thy grave . ''

		The beautiful sonnet called '' Spring and
Autumn	DATE	'' well illustrates the tender grace of
Madame Dar	ORGANIZATION	- mesteter 's best work : '' God in His heart made
Autumn	DATE	for the young ; That they might learn to accept the approach of age In golden woods and starry saxifrage And valleys all with azure mists o'erhung .

		For over Death a radiant veil He flung , That the inevitable heritage Might come revealed in beauty , and assuage The dread with which the heart of youth is wrung .

		And for the consolation of the old He made the delicate , swift , tumultuous
Spring	DATE	; That every year they might again behold The image of their youth in everything , And bless the fruit-trees flowering in the cold , Whose harvest is not for their gathering . ''

		Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	's '' Valete '' is a volume of per * sonal poems -LRB- mostly obituary -RRB- to the number of more than one hundred .

		The distinguished dead among Englishmen of the last twenty years have supplied the author with most of his subjects , and his verses are grouped under such heads as '' The Royal Dead , '' '' Shepherds of Men , '' and '' Singers among Men . ''

		Tennyson alone has upwards of a score of these tributes of song .

		Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	is the son of the Vicar of Shiplake , by whom
Tennyson	PERSON	was , on
June 13 , 1850	DATE	, united in marriage to
Miss Sellwood	LOCATION	, and to this fact the writer gracefully refers in the most ambitious of his tributes to his old friend : '' Or leaving Thames I seek by chalky dell My father 's terrace-garden o'er the flood , Where once a bride and bridegroom-poet stood , And heard in June-tide air the marriage bell Ring thro ' the walnuts that ' the hour is good When noble man weds noblest woman-hood . ' ''

		The sonnet on '' The Poet 's Death-Chamber '' -LRB- de - serves quotation .

		`` Not in the bright , unsolitary noon , When all the air with life and music rings , Came the great hush of those archangel wings , That gave the singer peace and endless boon ; But rather at the
midnight	TIME	hour of swoon When Sleep , Death 's prophet , unto
Nature	ORGANIZATION	brings Surcease of sense and outward communings Beneath that world of loneliness , the moon .

		And so he grew to marble he who made In hearts of stone the generous life-blood run , But o'er him dead , Death 's planet wheeling slow Flung down such splendour through the awful shade , As made us feel his soul was with the Sun And needed Death to give us back the glow . ''

		A number of Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	's tributes are paid to our own countrymen , among them Whitman ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and Bishop
Brooks	PERSON	.

		We select the son - net inscribed to our beloved
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet : `` We shall not see again the deep-set eyes , Tight mouth , thought-furrows on the friendly face That never disavowed the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	race .

		His shock of years is garnered under skies Well known , well sung of , for his soul was wise With all the change of season , and the grace Of Nature , stored afield in lonely place To melt the labourer 's heart with melodies .

		His voice was clear because he saw the truth , The simple truth that God would have men free .

		On furrows red with war his seed was sown ; And loving right and hating tyranny , He fashioned for a nation in its youth Such music as its age shall not disown . ''

		These sonnets are typical examples of Mr.
Rawns	PERSON	- 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ley 's work , which , although sinking occasionally into commonplace , maintains , as a whole , an even excellence .

		Although it rarely thrills , it rarely fails to please , and the note of its sympathy never seems forced .

		In his verses on '' The Public and the Poet , '' Mr.
James Rhoades	PERSON	remarks : '' Time was when a poet was deemed rara avis ; Now they babble on bough like the merle or the mavis .

		One or two in a lifetime was all very well ; But who 's to keep pace when some sixty break shell ? ''

		Who , indeed ?

		will echo the reviewer to whom come yearly two or three score volumes of minor verse .

		The general public , in happier ignorance of the gravity of the problem , may think of its old favor - ites and smile ; but the reader who keeps closely cognizant of the current Muse can not refrain from a half-formulated fear lest a considerable amount of good work be swamped by the swelling flood poured forth by mediocrity .

		Mr.
Rhoades	PERSON	, like most of the other versifiers discussed in this article , is a facile writer , and produces work very credita - ble in form , and freighted with enough of thought to interest and to please .

		His one-act tragedy , ''
Teresa	PERSON	, '' has composition and dramatic force ; his songs and sonnets and translations display good taste and serious feeling .

		Sometimes , as in this son - net on ``
Norman Ndruda	PERSON	, '' he rises to a real height : `` She stood with lifted bow in act to sweep The strings : sound flashed ; the silent air caught fire ; And , wave on wave upsurging high and higher , The waters of our soul one stormy heap Hung menacing .

		Anon she bade them sleep .

		She woke the winds of Memory : dead desire Revived ; hope grappled with the eternal liar ; Love saw the end , and deemed the forfeit cheap .

		She pierced the bounds of Being : with one breath Of that prevailing strain she fell on fate And slew it ; back swung the adamantine gate , Self-opening ; there was no more time or death .

		And then she ceased .

		And oh , how steep the fall From heaven to that dark , disenchanted hall ! ''

		We commend also the verses to
Gordon	LOCATION	, and some other pieces of a memorial character .

		Quod scripsi scripsi is the motto upon the title - page of Sir
John Croker Barrow	PERSON	's poems .

		The critic admits the fact , but wonders why .

		The au - thor 's
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	seems to be but a sorry nag , and shows no sign of wings .

		`` Some million star-worlds , it is said , Are whirling round us overhead ; And maybe there are millions more For future ages to explore . ''

		This stanza illustrates the jog-trot of the noble writer 's verse .

		When he will be philosophical , his discourse is after this prosaic fashion : '' She , though she breathes no word of ' Woman 's Right , ' Yet looks on Man as her inferior , And woe to him who rashly marries her !

		For he must either slave by day or night , Or else for liberty must firmly fight ; And lastly , whether he be conqueror Or conquered , must in either case incur The grave misfortune of a marriage blight . ''

		Is Woman in general the subject of this atrocious utterance ?

		And if so , where , oh where , are the avenging Thracian maidens ?

		We are all the more disposed to be frank in expressing an opinion of this volume , because its author distinctly hints that he is prepared for the worst .

		This is his envoy : '' Farewell , awhile , dear offspring of my mind !

		On trial ye must pass through prison Press , Before tribunal of a world not kind , Nor caring whether critics curse or bless .

		Farewell !

		Should rash reviewers shed your blood , Weep not !

		your tears will not be understood . ''

		We trust that verse like this will never be born into any other than '' a world not kind . ''

		For many years Mrs.
Augusta Webster	PERSON	has oc - cupied a more than respectable rank among the minor poets of contemporary
England	LOCATION	.

		She has published in the neighborhood of a dozen volumes , including some remarkable translations from JEs - chylus and
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		But 110 minor poet can ex - pect to live -LRB- except for the memory of his friends -RRB- in a dozen volumes ; most are fortunate if they are preserved in the anthologies .

		Yet the high excel - lence of Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	's verse is at least such as to justify the volume of '' Selections '' from her writ - ings which has just appeared , and which contains examples of her best narrative and lyrical styles , as well as a number of the dramatic monologues for which her genius seems peculiarly fitted .

		These monologues suggest the similar work of both
Brown	PERSON	- ing and
Tennyson	LOCATION	; of the former by their force and penetration , of the latter by their grace and finish .

		A fair example of Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	's lyrics is the following '' Song , '' which is neither better nor worse - than fifty others : '' Dear love , good-night .

		And , tender sleep , Seal up her lids like these drowsed flowers , To make day fair when they unclose .

		Be hushed around her ,
Night	ORGANIZATION	, and keep Thy silent guard on her repose ; But speed thine hours . ''

		Dear love , sleep on .

		This weary space I wake and long for day and thee , And count the slow stars from their west .

		Sleep while I hunger for thy face , Sleep , dearest , in unbroken rest ; But dream of me . ''

		Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	's strictly dramatic work is unrepre - sented in this selection .

		The new volume of poems by Professor
Roberts	PERSON	includes his ode for the
Shelley Centenary	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- reviewed by us at the time of its separate appearance -RRB- , a series of sonnets '' dealing with aspects of common outdoor life '' -LRB- some of these reprinted from '' In Divers Tones '' -RRB- , and a number of new ballads and lyrics .

		Once only , but once too often , the author has attempted the form of dialect humor , and the piece strikes the one discordant note of the collec - tion .

		We like very much the verses on '' Canadian Streams '' : `` St.
Lawrence	PERSON	, whose wide water laves The shores that ne'er have nourished slaves !

		Swift Richelieu of lilied fame !

		Niagara of glorious graves .

		1893 .

		J THE DIAL 269 '' Dread Saguenay , where eagles soar , What voice shall from the bastioned shore The tale of Roberval reveal .

		Or his mysterious fate deplore ? ''

		And thou far tide whose plains now beat With march of myriad westering feet ,
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	, whose virgin sod So late Canadian blood made sweet . ''

		This has the true patriotic ring , always a distinctive element in the author 's work .

		The following son - net on '' The Deserted City '' is a beautiful occi - dental echo of the passion of
Dante	LOCATION	, when he took for his text Quomodo sedet sola civitas ! ''

		There lies a little city leagues away .

		Its wharves the green sea washes all day long .

		Its busy , sun-bright wharves with sailors ' song And clamour of trade ring loud the live-long day .

		Into the happy harbour hastening , gay With press of snowy canvas , tall ships throng .

		The peopled streets to blithe-eyed Peace belong , Glad-housed beneath these crowding roofs of grey . '

		T was long ago this city prospered so , For yesterday a woman died therein .

		Since when the wharves are fallen idle , I know , And in the streets is hushed the pleasant din ; The thronging ships have been , the songs have been ; Since yesterday it is so long ago . ''

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's verses are characterized by an imaginative grasp of nature , and especially of na - ture in her sadder or sterner moods , that is often singularly impressive .

		The approach of winter , the sweep of the storm , and the majesty of the ice - bound northern wastes , are themes to which the au - thor frequently recurs , and which he continues to associate with the corresponding phases of human emotion .

		This interpenetration of the soul of man and the soul of the physical world may be taken as the predominant thought of Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's work .

		When in quiet vein , he gives us tender verses like these from '' An
August	DATE	Reverie '' : '' The ragged daisy starring all the fields , The buttercup abrim with pallid gold , The thistle and burr-flowers hedged with prickly shields , All common weeds the draggled pastures hold , With shrivelled pods and leaves , are kin to me , Like-heirs of earth and her maturity .

		`` They speak a silent speech that is their own , These wise and gentle teachers of the grass ; And when their brief and common days are flown , A certain beauty from the year doth pass : A beauty of whose light no eye can tell , Save that it went ; and my heart knew it well . ''

		A deeper melancholy breathes from the stanzas to ''
Autumn	DATE	, '' which can not fail to suggest the great ode of Keats . ''

		On silent nights , grey mists creep near the ground , And airs are keen and stars grow sharp and clear , And phantom frosts steal in and make no sound Down the long , haunted river , bleak and drear , Biting with death the sedges dank and sere , And ever the wan moon rises large and round Over the woodlands , flooding with iced dream The far-hushed , ghostly face of wood and field and stream . ''

		Another manner , one of infrequent occurrence , is illustrated by the stanzas entitled '' Love '' : '' Love came at dawn when all the world was fair , When crimson glories , bloom , and song were rife ; Love came at dawn when hope 's wings fanned the air , And murmured , ' I am life . ' ''

		Love came at even when the day was done , When heart and brain were tired , and slumber pressed ; Love came at eve , shut out the sinking sun , And whispered , ' I am rest . ' ''

		A tribute to
Robert Browning	PERSON	is one of the note - worthy poems of the collection .

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's chief defects are an occasional diffuseness , a use of awkward inversions , and a certain waywardness in his attitude toward the laws of rhythmical structure .

		These notes upon the Canadian singers of to-day may appropriately be closed by a few words about the volume of '' Later Canadian Poems '' which Mr.
Wetherell	PERSON	has edited .

		It includes selections from the two writers above mentioned , as well as from Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, Mr.
G. F. Cameron	PERSON	, Mr.
Archi	PERSON	- bald
Lampman	PERSON	, Mr.
D. C. Scott	PERSON	, Mr.
F. G. Scott	PERSON	, and half a dozen Canadian women .

		All the poems have been published within the last dozen years .

		Excellent portraits are given of the seven men whose work makes up the bulk of the collection .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	, we regret to say , is not represented by the poem which is by far his best his elegy on the death of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; and '' The Isles '' should certainly have been given among the selec - tions from Professor
Roberts	PERSON	.

		The book , as a whole , makes an excellent impression ; it seems to mark the rise of a distinctive school of Canadian song , having for its leading motive the faithful in - terpretation of nature , and for subsidiary motives the pride of patriotism and the sense of
Canada	LOCATION	's historical and legendary past .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Professor Huxley s
Romanes Lec	ORGANIZATION	- Professor Huxley J on Evolution ture on '' Jiivolution and Ethics -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has , of course , all the familiar characteristics of the author 's popular writ - ings the vigorous but not ungraceful style , the acute logic , and the comprehensive outlook .

		The significant thing about its matter is to be found in its attitude toward the ultra-individualism of which Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	is the most distinguished representa - tive .

		It is true , Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	contends , that the world has been shaped by the evolutionary process -LRB- as most deep souls have seen for two or three thousand years past -RRB- , and that '' the survival of the fittest '' is a formula useful in the solution of most of the problems of development .

		But when we rise to the ethical stage of development , the term '' fit - test '' must be given a modified meaning ; here , at least , it means more than physical superiority .

		Civ - ilization means , according to Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	, the sub - stitution of an '' ethical process '' for the '' cosmic process , '' the relation of the two being happily 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, illustrated by the relation of the '' governor '' to the engine of which it is essentially a part . ''

		The prac - tice of that which is ethically best what we call goodness or virtue involves a course of conduct which , in all respects , is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence .

		In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self - restraint ; in place of thrusting aside , or treading down , all competitors , it requires that the individ - ual shall not merely respect , but shall help his fel - lows ; its influence is directed , not so much to the survival of the fittest , as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive .

		It repudiates the gladia - torial theory of existence . ''

		This is very effective , but we fear that it is also a little rhetorical .

		Let us look at the next sentence : '' It demands that each man who enters into the enjoyment of the advan - tages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt to those who have laboriously constructed it ; and shall take heed that no act of his weakens the fabric in which he has been permitted to live . ''

		In these last words is concealed the whole contention .

		Is not that fabric weakened by some of the acts of which approval is above implied ?

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	would reply with an emphatic affirmative , and we see no escape from the conclusion that Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	has , after all , begged the question .

		In other words , to the argument fairly and squarely stated by Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	in '' The Man vs. the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	has given an evasive reply .

		What is needed in this discussion is a careful analysis of the acts done by philanthropic people in the name of altruism , in order to determine which of those acts really strengthen the social fabric , and which of them tend ultimately to weaken it .

		Such an analysis Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	fails to give us .

		Certainly , '' the fitting of as many as possible to survive '' -LRB- taking for granted that survival implies reproduction -RRB- is a social rule that can only result in a weakening of the social fabric on its physical side .

		And it remains to be shown that the ethical gain is sufficient to com - pensate for the physical loss .

		We do not say that this may not be shown ; we only assert that Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	makes no attempt to show it , and that he leaves the question precisely where it was left by Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's trenchant polemic .

		Mrs.
Claflin	PERSON	knew
Whittier	LOCATION	intimately , and is thus ena - bled to supply a stock of characteristic stories and sayings that give a clearer idea of the poet 's per - sonality than could be gained from volumes of the spongy and labored dissertation which average crit - icism sheds about the memory of departed -LRB- and therefore defenceless -RRB- eminence .

		Whittier a clear - seeing , genuine soul , to whom conventionalism was a farce and cant an abomination was annoyed and embarrassed by the gushing expressions of silly ad - mirers . ''

		He said to me , '' says the author , '' ` What does thee think women make such silly speeches to me for ?

		It makes me feel like a fool .

		A woman said to me yesterday , '' Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, your smile is a benediction . ''

		As I was walking across the floor at the
Radical Club	ORGANIZATION	a woman stopped me in the middle of the parlor among all the folks and said , '' I 've long wished to see you , Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, to ask you what you thought of the subjective and the ob - jective . ''

		Why , I thought the woman was crazy , and I said , '' I do n't know anything about either of 'em '' ' '' which was a solution worthy of Mr.
Dick	PERSON	.

		One shudders to think of the Orphic answer which
A. Bronson Alcott	PERSON	would have made to this all too - tempting query .

		Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	was always reluctant to meet strangers especially on formal occasions .

		`` On one occasion , '' says Mrs.
Claflin	PERSON	, `` I invited some of his old acquaintances to an afternoon tea ... He was so shy that he could not be counted upon , and often , if he suspected company had been invi - ted to meet him , he would slip away .

		With his keen perception and insight , he discovered that something a little out of the ordinary course was going on , and he said , ' What is thee going to do ?

		I think thee is going to do something . '

		I replied , ` Why do you think so , Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	? '

		` Oh , I know thee is going to have some kind of a fandan - go . ' ''

		When the guests came , however , the poet received them cordially , and the '' fandango '' passed off without friction .

		The volume contains two por - traits of Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, and a poem by Miss
Edna Dean Proctor	PERSON	embodying `` his almost life-long plaint of sleepless nights , and the gladness with which he hailed the dawn . ''

		and j. ^ , , j g ^ j arge gub j ect that Dr.
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	has sought to compass in a small volume recently published -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He discusses in successive chapters the work of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	as an art-critic , as `` the founder of phae - nomenology of nature , '' as '' a writer and prose - poet , '' as a student of social and economical ques - tions , and as an opponent of the sporting element in English life .

		Each of these subjects is treated in a scientific manner , and with evident conscien - tiousness .

		Upon one or two of them Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	is peculiarly competent to pass judgment , and upon all of them his opinion is deserving of respectful attention .

		Yet the note of the entire book seems to us one of defective sympathy , of penetration to a certain depth only , and of obtuseness to all that lies beneath that depth .

		His critique of Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin 's work as a social reformer is the most accept - able part of the study , although there are some ex - cellent observations in the chapter on English sports and pastimes .

		But justice has hardly been done to Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's attitude towards the latter subject ; the spirit of his writings upon this theme is not as antagonistic as the author would have us believe .

		As a critic of art we still prefer Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	to Dr.
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 Waldstein , for the latter sees only the technical aspect of art , while the former takes into account the spiritual and ethical aspects as well .

		Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin 's dictum that art has a moral no less than an intel - lectual message has always been a stumbling-block in the way of most of his critics , yet we are inclined to think that he has in no other way done greater service to his fellows than by his insistence , in sea - son and out of season , upon this fundamental tenet .

		A text-book of * '' stoi y f French literature , French literature studied in the French language , ought to be an essential part of the French course in our high schools .

		When that course covers the full period of four years , the last of the four may suitably be devoted to this subject .

		An excellent text-book for such study is provided by
Madame Delphine Duval	PERSON	's '' Petite Histoire de la Litte ` rature Francaise '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is written in a simple and attractive style , and covers the entire period of French literary history .

		Such a book as this has long been needed , and we give it a cordial welcome .

		One or two points which have attracted our attention while reading the book may be briefly mentioned .

		It is a little curious to be told , in a comparison of the '' Chanson de Roland '' with the '' Iliad , '' that the former poem is the loftier in thought .

		We should hardly char - acterize
Celimene	PERSON	as `` une coquette maligne , '' nor should we describe '' Le Systeme de la Nature '' as `` logiquement absurde . ''

		Still less should we say that
Gautier	PERSON	had '' ni ide'es , ni sensibilite '' , ni imagi - nation . ''

		A few positive errors may be noted .

		The date of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's birth is given as
1652	DATE	instead of
1622	DATE	.

		The writer says that it is not known exactly why
Voltaire	PERSON	took his nom de guerre .

		On the con - trary , it is perfectly well known that
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	is the anagram of Arouet 1 .

		j. -LRB- lejeune -RRB- .

		We are told that
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's works are about equally divided be - tween prose and verse .

		Really there is five or six times as much prose as verse .

		Finally , '' Le Gendre de
Monsieur Poirier	PERSON	'' is the work of
Sandeau	PERSON	and
Augier	PERSON	, not of Sandeau and Scribe .

Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- may feel some surprise at the statement in his Prefatory Note that '' no brief and accurate biography of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is now be - fore the public . ''

		But on reflection , the statement is seen to be strictly true .

		Many indeed there are which are neither brief nor accurate , many more which are brief but not accurate , while only one
Halliwell	PERSON	-
Phillips	PERSON	's '' Outlines '' can be said to be strictly based on evidence ; and that , containing as it does a large amount of illustrative and collateral matter , is so far from being brief that it extends to two immense volumes .

		While this monumental work is greatly valued by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	students , its bulk and great inclusiveness of minute details unfit it for the uses of the average reader of Shakespeare wishing the sim - ple facts of the poet 's life .

		Mr.
Wilder	PERSON	's plan has been to copy and combine from the best sources Halliwell-Phillips being of course the chief only the proven facts , and to present them in due order without comment .

		The first twenty pages are de - voted to
John Shakespeare	PERSON	, the poet 's father , and begin with the year
1551	DATE	, when he left the parental home and settled in
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	.

		There , in
1564	DATE	, the baptismal register records the birth of the son afterwards to make the name so illustrious .

		The details in the life of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	are limited almost entirely to records of his business transactions , dates of the presentation of certain of his plays or of their publication .

		Of his manner of daily life , his methods of composition , his tastes and interests , we know absolutely nothing ; the books which aspire to describe these may be highly entertaining but are absolutely untrustworthy .

		The present work does not profess to supply a connected narrative ; this would be a task now forever impos - sible to any diligence ; but it does give compactly the results of the best scholarship and most careful scru - tiny applied to the collection of all that can now be gathered concerning the life of the most distin - guished of all English poets .

		A social and economic philosophy factors in .

		p i American based on the doctrine ot evolution has not yet been completely formu - lated .

		But numerous books , pamphlets , arid mono - graphs are constantly appearing dealing with one phase or another of these questions , and seeking to apply scientific evolutionary principles to the de - tailed problems of sociology and economics .

		The

Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	.

		by
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	p atmO re , will be en - joyed by readers whose tastes are scholarly and whose standards , social , political , and religious , are conservative .

		There are twenty-eight papers in all , 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, most of them reprinted from the '' Fortnightly Re - view . ''

		The following extract from an astonishing little treatise on `` The Weaker Vessel '' indicates , in a way , Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	's general attitude toward modern views and tendencies : '' To maintain that man and woman are equals in intelligent action is just as absurd as it would be to maintain that the hand that throws a ball and the wall that casts it back are equal .

		The woman has an exquisite per - ception and power of admiring all the man can be or do .

		She is the glory of his prowess and nobility in war , statesmanship , arts , invention , and manners ; and she is able to fulfil this , her necessary and de - lightful function , just because she is herself nothing in battle , policy , poetry , discovery , or original intel - lectual or moral force of any kind . ''

		Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	seems to have fallen into the error of mistaking woman as he would like to see her , for woman as she is .

		That the sex is not wholly made up of `` Amelia Sedleys , '' the people of
Chicago	LOCATION	, at least , have had ocular and aural demonstration in this year of Columbian `` Congresses . ''

		A
Manual of Physics	ORGANIZATION	for High Schools .

		The '' High School Laboratory Man - ual of Physics '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , prepared by Messrs.
Dudley G. Hays	PERSON	,
Charles D. Lowry	PERSON	, and
Austin C. Rishel	PERSON	, is the best book of the sort that we have yet seen .

		It is the work of three experienced teachers , and the 113 exercises it prescribes cover the entrance requirements in physics of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, which are .

		probably higher than those of any other institution .

		The following prefatory statement is admirable in its good sense : '' The authors are not so visionary as to suppose that boys and girls can , unaided , redis - cover the laws of physics ; but we know that , if suf - ficiently careful directions are given to pupils in the performance of experiments , and definite instruc - tion is given them as to the manner of studying results obtained , they will learn from
Nature	ORGANIZATION	first - hand many of her great laws . ''

		Our only quarrel with the book is that it begins with the subject of magnetism , for very inadequate reasons displaced from its proper position .

		`` Builders of American Literature . ''

		A book of two hundred and eighty - five pages which attempts to give biographical sketches of one hundred and eleven different persons can not be much more than a mere catalogue of names and dates .

		Hence , Mr.Underwood 's `` Builders of American Literature '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- arouses little expectation of serious literary value .

		Yet even that little is hardly satisfied by these barren and lifeless sketches of some of the most interesting figures in American literature .

		The book begins with
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	and in - cludes only authors born previous to
1826	DATE	; a sec - ond series is promised in order to bring the list down to date .

		Let us hope that a little more ex - clusiveness in selection will reduce the number of names and afford more opportunity for doing jus - tice to those that remain . ''

		The book is one that no lover of horses will wish to do without .

Higby	PERSON	, within his limits , has made a good selection of facts , and has stated them clearly .

		His chapters on local government are particularly to be commended , although they now and then contain startling statements , such as this : '' The
New England	LOCATION	town , however , has no En - glish prototype , it is from
Holland	LOCATION	. ''

		Great contro - versies are not to be thus briefly disposed of .

		ESQUEMELING 'S famous work on '' The Buccaneers of
America	LOCATION	, '' which was reprinted in a popular series of the classics of adventure not long ago , now comes to us in another and far more pretentious form of repro - duction -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		It is edited by Mr.
Henry Powell	PERSON	, and includes the text of
1684	DATE	, and
Basil Ringrose	PERSON	's Fourth Part of the following year .

		It con - tains a map and facsimiles of the original engravings .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	contributes a somewhat extended descriptive introduction .

		The work is a handsome octavo of five hundred pages .

		A NEW edition of the `` Index to
Harper	PERSON	's New Monthly Magazine '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- carries that useful work through the eighty-fifth volume that is , all the way from
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273
June , 1850	DATE	, to
November , 1892	DATE	.

		The last edition of this index , which comprised seventy volumes , is here reprinted unchanged upon the odd-numbered pages .

		Upon the even-numbered pages are the entries referring to the subsequent fifteen volumes .

		While this is slightly less convenient than a single alphabetical arrangement would be , it is still an easy matter to find what the mag - azine has had upon any subject , and the publishers would hardly have been justified in going to the expense of new plates for the sake of the later volumes .

		THE `` Men of Achievement '' series -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has received two accessions .

		Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	has writ - ten character sketches of a round dozen of '' States - men , '' from Clay and
Webster	PERSON	to
Garfield	PERSON	and Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	sketches too colorless to be impressive , and too laudatory to be accepted as serious history .

		Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	's '' Men of Business '' are sixteen in num - ber , and include
J. J. Astor	PERSON	,
Cornelius Vanderbilt	PERSON	,
Cyrus W. Field	PERSON	,
Peter Cooper	PERSON	,
Messrs. P. D. Armour	PERSON	,
Marshall Field	ORGANIZATION	, and
George M. Pullman	PERSON	, and the unique Mr.
Depew	PERSON	.

		Both of these volumes have simple illus - trations .


MR. E. S. MARTIN	PERSON	'S `` Windfalls of Observation '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are pleasant little essays that may be classi - fied somewhere between '' The Reveries of a Bachelor '' and '' Virginibus Puerisque . ''

		There are sixteen of them , on such subjects as '' Courtship , '' '' College , '' '' Di - vorce , '' and '' Death . ''

		We find in them shrewd obser - vation , pointed anecdote , and a subdued but ready wit .

		They are of the sort of literature to take up at odd mo - ments , and lay aside with but a momentary regret .

		One who is reading them feels himself in good society , and is likely to be the better for their wholesome pre - cepts .

		As a supplement to the `` Annals of the
American Academy of Political	ORGANIZATION	and Social Science '' -LRB-
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia -RRB- we have a pamphlet monograph on '' Inland Water - ways : Their Relation to
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
Emory R. Johnson	PERSON	.

		The author discusses English and Amer - ican canals in their influence upon the development of a country and in their effect upon railway tariffs , gives an account of the waterways now in operation or pro- cess of construction , considers their economic bearings , and contrasts their execution by public and private en - terprise , with decision in favor of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a special chapter on the
Nicaragua Canal	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE Rev.
James Wood	PERSON	has compiled a '' Dictionary of Quotations '' -LRB-
Warne	PERSON	-RRB- of 30,000 entries , including proverbs and pithy sayings from the principal ancient and modern languages .

		The quotations are all in a single alphabet , but the compiler does not seem to have the most rudimentary notion of what alphabetical ar - rangement means .

		We find entries under the articles , definite and indefinite , in all the languages represented , and such entries as '' a belief '' between '' ab alio '' and '' abends . ''

		This fundamental and unpardonable error is partly remedied by an extensive topical index .

		In spite of its faults , literary workers will find the book useful .


SIGNOR F. TARDUCCI	PERSON	'S work on `` John and
Sebas	PERSON	- tian Cabot '' has been put into English by Mr.
Henry F. Brownson	PERSON	-LRB-
Detroit	LOCATION	: The Author -RRB- , who also trans - lated
Tarducci	ORGANIZATION	's life of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		This translation is authorized , even in its occasional departures from the original .


Signor Tarducci	PERSON	has fixed the date of
John Cabot	PERSON	's discovery of our continent as
June 24 , 1494	DATE	.

		He has also established the Venetian nationality of both the Cabots .

		The work is a minute and painstaking study , based upon many newly unearthed documents , and modifies in several respects the current estimate of the two navigators .

		The work makes a volume of more than four hundred pages .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Oct. 25 , 1893	DATE	.

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, for so many years the head of the publishing house founded by his father , has long been known as a frequent contributor to the peri - odicals , in articles concerning copyright and the relations of publishers and authors .

		With other Americans he was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor for his services in getting the International Copyright bill through
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and he has been active in all mat - ters connected with the writing and publishing of books .

		It can hardly be said that literary men generally look upon him as an advocate of their peculiar interests , but in all cases where the mutual interests of publishers and authors are at stake Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	can be found vigor - ously maintaining the struggle .

		This being the case , it has been somewhat of a surprise that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has not collected his extensive store of information on these subjects in permanent book form .

		He has edited `` The Question of Copyright '' in the '' Questions of the Day '' series , and has written a little book , '' Authors and Pub - lishers : a Manual of Suggestions for Beginners in Lit - erature , '' which , I take it , is quite as useful for begin - ners in publishing as for beginners in literature .

		These have been his only volumes of the kind .

		I am now glad to announce that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has been engaged for some years upon a work of great importance , being '' A Sketch of the
History of Literary Property	ORGANIZATION	from the Invention of Printing to the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A vol - ume introductory to this work , by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, '' Au - thors and Their Public in Ancient Times , '' has already been announced to appear this
fall	DATE	.

		Its chapters deal with the very beginnings of literature in
Chaldea	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
Judea	LOCATION	, and with the subject as presented in the literatures of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Alex	PERSON	- andria ,
Rome	LOCATION	, and the Byzantine Empire , down to the invention of printing .

		There will also be an interesting chapter on '' book terminology in ancient times . ''

		When our universities East and West are each the happy pos - sessor of a '' school of letters , '' no doubt these volumes by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	will form the standard text books on their subject .

		There is no question that they will prove the most important contributions yet made to the his - tory of literary property .

		M.
Paul Blouet	PERSON	, that citizen of the world , has reached
London	LOCATION	again , having travelled around the globe dur - ing his lecture tour of the
last two years	DATE	.

		The final series of lectures was delivered in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and was the most successful in his experience .

		His Amer - ican agents wish him to lecture here this
winter	DATE	, but he prefers to indulge in a period of rest and recreation .

		He has taken a charming little cottage on the
Acacia Road	ORGANIZATION	, a few minutes ' ride from
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park , in a neighborhood where many of his friends and acquaint - ances have their homes .

		Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Sidney Luska	PERSON	'' -RRB- has also returned to
London	LOCATION	, having spent an idyllic
summer	DATE	, with his wife , at a small village on the northern coast of
France	LOCATION	, near
Dieppe	LOCATION	.

		With six of their friends , young English painters , they occupied a cottage at
Varengeville	LOCATION	, one of
Normandy	LOCATION	's most pic - 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, turesque places , and devoted themselves about equally to work and to pleasure .

		There is no prospect of the Harlands returning to
New York	LOCATION	in the near future .

		They have probably become permanent members of our literary colony abroad .

		In recent work Mr.
Harland	PERSON	seems to have given up his realistic studies of Jewish life in the metropolis , and to have joined the ranks of the French symbolists .

		The
Maeterlinck	PERSON	movement is upon us at last , in the shape of a production of this writer 's play , '' The In - truder '' -LRB- P/n < rMse -RRB- , by students of Mr.
Franklin H. Sar	PERSON	- gent 's Academy of the Dramatic Arts .

		Ibsen has so quickly succeeded
Browning	PERSON	, and now
Maeterlinck	PERSON	seems so likely to displace
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, in the estimation of our lit - erary f urorists , that one can not help wondering who and what will succeed
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and his work .

		Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	, editor of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' than whom there is no more subtle philosopher in our country , has said the best word about '' the new Shakespeare . ''

		In an interview he expresses himself as follows : `` Maet - erlinck is interesting .

		He has based his plays , < Les Aveugles , ' ' L'Intruse , ' and ' Les Sept Princesses , ' on primitive sensations of fear and apprehension .

		The at - traction which this fear of fear has always had for man contains the spirit of adventure .

		Maeterlinck would do his work better if he were better acquainted with the nature of the law under which he is working almost un - consciously . ''

		Mrs.
Lucy Gibbons Morse	PERSON	, whose novel of anti-slavery times in
New York	LOCATION	is soon to be published by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	, besides being a granddaughter of
Isaac T. Hopper	PERSON	, the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	philanthropist , is the daughter of the late
James Sloan Gibbons	PERSON	, who wrote the popular war lyric , '' We are coining , Father Abra'am , three hun - dred thousand more , '' and the wife of Mr.
James Her	PERSON	-
bert Morse	PERSON	, a well-known litterateur and educator of this city .

		The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	speech is still used in the family life of the Morses .

		They are very hospitable , and their home on Madison avenue has been the scene of many entertainments in honor of distinguished literary visitors .

		Word comes from
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	that the women 's colleges in
America	LOCATION	are held in small esteem there ; in fact , that no American girl has taken successfully the highest examinations in the leading English colleges .

		It is asserted that American girls can not pass them , even after graduation at home followed by three years at
Newnham	LOCATION	.

		I hear that a society of '' granddaughters of Vassar '' has recently been formed by daughters of graduates who are themselves students at
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	.

		Per - haps these statements are worthy of their attention .

STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		A new biography of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	is announced as in preparation by Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	, the author of a life of
Defoe	PERSON	.

		It is said that
Lord Bowen	PERSON	may undertake to write the life of
Jowett	PERSON	, from the materials left by the Mas - ter in the hands of his executors .

		M. Zola and Mr.
William Nye	PERSON	have just been made honorary life members of the
London	LOCATION
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Authorship is like misery , in that it makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows .


Hazlitt	PERSON	's grandson is about to put on the market a parcel of five hundred letters , manuscripts , rare presen - tation copies , and first editions representing Lamb ,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and others .

		Dr.
William Smith	PERSON	, editor of the familiar Classical Dictionaries , the Dictionary of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and other sim - ilar reference works , died on
October 7	DATE	, at the age of eighty .

		Since
1867	DATE	he had been the editor of '' The Quarterly Review . ''

		M. Zola is reported to have expressed surprise at the number of English journalists who can speak correct French , and to have said that there are but four French journalists of the present day who have a thorough knowledge of English .

		The forthcoming '' Letters of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, '' to be published by
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will fill nearly a thousand pages .

		They range from
1797	DATE	to
1825	DATE	, when the '' Journal '' begins .

		As they were written to
Scott	PERSON	's most intimate friends , they will prove hardly second to the '' Journal '' in interest .

		The new Norwegian law of copyright provides for ownership during the author 's lifetime and the fifty years following .

		Anonymous and pseudonymous works secure copyright for fifty years from the date of their publication .

		This clearly puts a premium upon the ac - knowledgement of authorship , and is a step in the right direction .


Herr Theodor Graf	PERSON	's unique collection of ancient Greek portraits , unearthed in the
Fayoum	LOCATION	a few years ago , has been on exhibition , during the
summer	DATE	, in Old
Vienna	LOCATION	, at the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, and , during the past month , in one of the galleries of the
Chicago Art Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original find included nearly a hundred portraits ; of these , about a score have been sold , a few are hung in the Exposition art gallery , and the remain - der , to the number of sixty-five , are on exhibition as above stated .

		The collection is of extraordinary inter - est , and it is to be hoped that a part of it , at least , may be secured for this country .

		Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	prefaces a recent autobiographical sketch with the following hypothetical explanation of how a man may come to write such an account of himself : '' An importunate person informs him that his portrait is about to be published , and will be accompanied by a biography which the importunate person purposes to write .

		The sufferer knows what that means ; either he undertakes to revise the ` biography ' or he does not .

		In the former case , he makes himself responsible ; in the latter , he allows the publication of a mass of more or less fulsome inaccuracies , for which he will be held responsible by those who are familiar with the prevalent art of self-advertisement .

		On the whole , it may be better to get over the ' burlesque of being em - ployed in this manner , ' and do the thing himself . ''

		One of the most active spirits of the World 's Con - gress Auxiliary was Lieut.
Fletcher S. Bassett	PERSON	,
U.S.N.	LOCATION	, who died in
Chicago	LOCATION	on the
19th of October	DATE	, at the age of forty-three .

		The Folk-lore
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which was among the most important of the
summer	DATE	's gatherings , was mainly planned and organized by him , and to his disinterested and untiring zeal its great success was chiefly due .

		Lieut.
Bassett	PERSON	served in the navy seven -
teen years 1865	DATE	to
1882	DATE	, loss of health compelling his retirement from active service .

		Afterwards he de - voted himself chiefly to literary and scientific work .

		He was especially interested in folk-lore , and was one of the founders of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Folk-lore Society and edi - tor of the '' Folk-lorist '' Magazine .

		He was a contrib - utor to THE DIAL and to varioiis literary and scientific periodicals .

		THE DIAL 275 A ROSE FROM OMAR 'S GRAVE .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has inscribed the following grace - ful verses to the rose-tree brought by Mr.
W. Simpson	PERSON	from Omar 's tomb in
Naishapiir	LOCATION	, and planted
October 7	DATE	on the grave of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	at Boulge : '' Reign here , triumphant rose from Omar 's grave , Borne by a fakir o'er the Persian wave ; Reign with fresh pride , since here a heart is sleeping That double glory to your Master gave . ''

		Hither let many a pilgrim step be bent , To greet the rose re-risen in banishment ; Here richer crimsons may its cup be keeping Than brimmed it ere from Naishdpiir it went . '

		The same subject has elicited from Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	the following sonnet , entitled '' Prayer to the Winds '' : '' Hear us , ye winds !

		From where the North-wind strows Blossoms that crown ' the King of Wisdom 's ' tomb , The trees here planted bring remembered bloom Dreaming in seed of Love 's ancestral rose To meadows where a braver North-wind blows O'er greener grass , o'er hedge-rose , may , and broom , And all that make
East England	LOCATION	's field-perfume Dearer than any fragrance
Persia	LOCATION	knows : Hear us , ye winds , North ,
East	LOCATION	, and West and South !

		This granite covers him whose golden mouth Made wiser ev 'n the Word of Wisdom 's king : Blow softly o'er the grave of Omar 's herald Till roses rich of Omar 's dust shall
spring	DATE	From richer dust of
Suffolk	LOCATION	's rare FitzGerald ! ''

		THE LATE
MR. FREEMAN	PERSON	'S OPINION OF EMERSON AND
BROWNING	PERSON	.

		From an entertaining article on the late
E. A. Free	PERSON	- man , in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' for
November	DATE	, we ex - tract the following characteristic utterances of the great historian on two of the most distinguished of his con - temporaries ,
Emerson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	: '' Among essayists , he also failed to appreciate Emer - son , partly for the occasional lack of clearness in his writings , and partly for his poetical way of treating some historical events , which roused Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	's im - patience . '

		I took up a thing of his the other day , ' he wrote , ' and his notion of the Norman Conquest was that '' twenty thousand thieves founded the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Lords ! ''

		He seemed to come into
England	LOCATION	not knowing anything whatever about anything . ' ''

		As to poetry , his fondness for a clear , direct style made him unable to appreciate such a poet as
Browning	PERSON	. '

		Bother
Browning	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	and all people who write not to be understood ! '

		he wrote , in one of his letters .

		I well remember his enjoyment of the amusing incidents which we saw on
Commemoration Day	ORGANIZATION	in
Oxford	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	, when
Browning	PERSON	received his honorary degree .

		Of all the witty and absurd sallies which came from the students in the upper galleries of the Sheldonian theatre that morning , none evoked so much laughter as those which met
Robert Browning	PERSON	as he stood in his scarlet doctor 's robe , during his presentation to the Vice-Chan - cellor .

		From the gallery a red cotton nightcap fastened to a string -LRB- referring to his ' Red Cotton Night-Cap Country ' -RRB- was dangled over the heads of the Vice-Chan - cellor and other dignitaries , as they sat in all their mag - nificence below , and was at last skilfully landed on the head of
Browning	PERSON	himself .

		At the same time a huge cartoon was also let down , on which was a comical car - icature of the poet with an enormous head on a very little body , and beside him a similar figure of a member of the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	, imploring him in a rhymed couplet to show him how to understand his poetry .

		Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	sympathized heartily with that member of the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	, for he could not get hold of
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's poetry , though personally he liked him .

		In
April , 1884	DATE	, he wrote : '' ' At that dinner I sat opposite to
Browning	PERSON	, and found that in private life he was much like another man .

		I had thought that his Comitatus , the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	, would follow him everywhere to explain what he said .

		But if a man can talk to be understood , why ca n't he write to be understood ?

		But those things are not in my line Homer and Macaulay for me them I can understand . ' ''

		M. ZOLA AND MR. OSCAR WILDE .

		The following amusing incident of
M. Zola	PERSON	's visit to
London	LOCATION	is reported by the newspaper correspondents : '' On the night of his arrival in
London	LOCATION	M. Zola was re - covering from the fatigue of the journey under the be - nign influence of the Savoy cuisine , and had just reached the stage when a cup of coffee and a cigar put a fin - ishing stroke on the soothing process of digestion , when the door opened and a waiter entered , bearing a mag - nificent basket of flowers .

		The gratified guest supposed at first that this was but another token of the manager 's kind attention , but he had not time to express his thanks before the attendant delivered the following message : ` Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, sir , sends these flowers and asks if you will receive him for a few minutes . '

		The words were roughly translated to
M. Zola	PERSON	, who still seemed puzzled and shook his head , exclaiming : ' Oscawoile !

		Oscawoile !

		Je ne le connais pas . ' '

		Qu ' est-ce que c'est done que cette espece d'animal , Oscawoile ? '

		inquired a famous journalist , equally ignorant of English pro- nunciation . '

		Qu'on lui rende ses legumes et qu'on le mette a la porte , ' cried another .

		At last the personal conductor of the party got a hearing and explained that the unknown donor was the apostle of British sestheti - cism a recommendation which failed to touch the hearts of his audience .

		Finally
M. Zola	PERSON	bethought himself of looking at the gentleman 's card , and at once a smile of intelligence lit up his expressive features as he gasped out in repentant accents : ' Mais , Nom de Dieu , c'est
Monsieur Oscarre Veelde	PERSON	, 1 ` auteur de '' Sa - lomd , '' que nous connaissons tous .

		Faites-le monter de suite . ' '

		Oscarre Veelde ! '

		shouted all the others , ' pour - quoi ne pas 1 ` avoir dit d'abord ? '

		And so the two mas - ter spirits of the age were brought into contact . ''

		PROGRESS OF THE NEWSPAPER PRESS .

		The following figures are from a report of Mr.
J. A. Strahan	PERSON	's paper on '' The Progress of the Newspaper Press , '' recently read before the British Association : '' In
1712	DATE	the year when the stamp tax on newspapers was first imposed the yearly circulation of newspapers in En - gland was about 2,000,000 .

		In
1755	DATE	it was about 7,400,000 , in
1767	DATE	about 11,300,000 , in
1801	DATE	about 16,000,000 , in
1811	DATE	about 25,500,000 , in
1820	DATE	about 29,500,000 , in
1831	DATE	about 37,700,000 , in
1836	DATE	about 39,400,000 .

		In
1837	DATE	the stamp tax was reduced from 3 l-4d .

		net to a penny , and the circulation that year rose to nearly 54,000,000 .

		In
1841	DATE	it had increased to about 60 , - 000,000 .

		In
1854 the last year	DATE	of the stamp tax it stood at 122,000,000 .

		Since
1854	DATE	estimates of circulation must be largely conjectural and approximate ; but the great increase in the number of newspapers , from 493 in
1840	DATE	to
1817	DATE	in
1882	DATE	, and to 2200 in
1893	DATE	, and the even more marked increase in the number of persons connected with journalism , as shown by the census for example , of ' authors , editors , and writers , ' 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, from
1528	DATE	in
1861	DATE	to 3434 in
1881	DATE	, and of reporters from 636 in
1861	DATE	to 2677 in
1881	DATE	show that newspaper production must have increased enormously .

		Other figures point the same way .

		There are now twenty-nine daily papers morning and evening in
London	LOCATION	.

		Taking the average daily circulation of each as about 100,000 copies , the annual circulation of the
London	LOCATION	dailies alone must approach 1,000,000,000 .

		The 170 provincial dailies must have at least an equal circulation .

		The yearly circulation of daily papers alone then must reach 2,000,000,000 . ''

		306 THE ENDOWMENTS OF CULTURE IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Marshall Field	PERSON	's magnificent gift of a
million dollars	MONEY	, for the establishment of a pub - lic museum in
Chicago	LOCATION	, will add one more to the lengthening list of the city 's endowed in - stitutions .

		It is true that the gift is made con - tingent upon certain conditions , but they are not onerous , and it is already practically cer - tain that they will be fulfilled .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	's offer is made upon a plan that has found much favor with recent philanthropists .

		He stipu - lates that half a
million dollars	MONEY	more shall be raised by subscription , and that a further con - tribution of Exposition stock , to the nominal amount of two millions , shall be made by its holders .

		As the probable value of this stock will be from ten to fifteen per cent , of its nom - inal value , the
Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	will have a total endowment of one and three-quarters millions .

		It is probable that the Museum will acquire the most beautiful of the Exposition structures the Art Building , designed by Mr.
Atwood	PERSON	for its permanent home ; and thus , placed in the midst of an attractive park , eas - ily accessible , yet far from the bustle of busi - ness life , it will be ideally situated , and will stand as the worthiest possible memorial of the great Exposition once held at its doors .

		An incidental advantage of this situation will be found in its proximity to the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, a proximity which will considerably enhance the educational possibilities of both institutions .

		It will , of course , be many years before the collections that go to make a great museum can be brought together , but probably no insti - tution of the sort ever had so much material to start with as is already assured the new en - terprise .

		Great liberality in this matter is be - ing displayed by the governments and individ - uals represented in the Exposition that has just closed its gates , and valuable offerings from many such sources have already been accepted by the trustees of the Museum .

		American an - thropology and archeology will be richly illus - trated by the collections already owned by the Exposition Company , and to be transferred to the custody of the Museum .

		The natural re - sources of this country , especially in woods and minerals , will also be abundantly displayed .

		Art will be represented by valuable collections of casts and photographs , at least ; as for orig - inal works , we must be content to wait awhile .

		The collection will , of course , be very incom - plete and unbalanced for some years , but a ju - dicious expenditure of the income from the en - dowment fund will accomplish wonders .

		But we must still remember that a museum , like a library , is not to be had for cash , and
Chicago	LOCATION	must be content , for a century or so , to be over - shadowed by the British Museum and a few other European institutions .

		It may be well to glance for a moment at the provision already made in this city for what 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, may be called the endowment of culture .

		The new Museum is but the last of a long series of efforts , on the part of generous philanthropists , to place education , research , and art within easy reach of the people .

		The part played by the municipal government itself is of no mean importance .

		It ungrudgingly supports a very extensive and complete system of common and high school education , as well as a public li - brary system probably the most efficient in the whole country , and costly in proportion to its efficiency .

		A city which does these things does about all that is permitted by the spirit of American institutions , a spirit which has pos - sibly gone too far in its reaction against old - world paternalism , but which is the vital prin - ciple of our social organization .

		Fortunately , private generosity has not been lacking to carry on the work from the point where the public leaves it off , and nowhere else in the
United States	LOCATION	has private generosity done so much for the higher public welfare as in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Our great private endowments for public purposes offer the most conspicuous illustration of that '' civic pride '' which is rightly held to be a marked characteristic of this city , of that qual - ity which makes of
Chicago	LOCATION	a true social organ - ism in a sense not to be predicated of
New York	LOCATION	, hardly to be predicated of any other great American city .

		The endowment of our higher education is represented by the new
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, which , in means , strength of faculty , and ele - vation of standard , already ranks among the foremost of American institutions of the higher O learning .

		This endowment we owe , primarily , to Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	, who is not a Chicagoan , but also in large measure to those of our wealthy citizens who have so abundantly sup - plemented his gifts .

		Next in importance must be ranked the
Armour Institute	ORGANIZATION	for second - ary and technical training , named from its founder , who has devoted from one to two mil - lion dollars to its purposes .

		The two manual training schools now in operation , and the
Lewis	PERSON	polytechnic school soon to be established , are important additions to our endowed insti - tutions of education .

		The
Newberry	PERSON	and
Cre	ORGANIZATION	- rar Libraries , with their endowments of from two to four millions each , will provide
Chica	LOCATION	- goans of the near future with opportunities for research unequalled elsewhere upon the West - ern Continent .

		The
Art Institute of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, with its beautiful new building upon a public site , with its choice and rapidly increasing col - lection of original masterpieces and reproduc - tions , and with its well-organized schools , pro- vides the art-life of the community with a cen - tre , and offers excellent opportunities for art education .

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	of the future is thus certain to be well supplied to a considerable extent it is already supplied with the means of cul - ture represented by libraries and museums , art collections , and institutions of the technical and higher learning .

		The rapid survey above made shows us of what the community is already as - sured .

		The question still remains of what fur - ther endowments of culture are desirable , of what new outlet may be suggested for the ener - gies of the philanthropist , of what is needed to make the community in a sense complete in re - spect of the means whereby its intellectual and aesthetic wants may be satisfied .

		We would sug - gest in this connection , as both practicable and desirable , the endowment of three more insti - tutions a theatre , an orchestra , and a news - paper .

		Each of these three objects is worthy the attention of the philanthropist ; either of them would prove of incalculable value to the spiritual life of the community .

		The endowed , or at least subsidized , theatre is so well known in
Europe	LOCATION	that there would be nothing experimental in such an undertak - ing .

		But what is done in this direction by state authority in the old world must be done by private generosity in the new .

		It is a cu - rious coincidence that both of the distinguished actors Mr.
Irving	PERSON	and Mr.
Willard	PERSON	who have addressed the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	during the present year should have made a common point of urging the importance of an endowed theatre in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and even of pre - dicting its establishment .

		When we think what an influence has been exerted by the three
National Theatres of France	ORGANIZATION	, by the Court The - atres of a number of the States of
Germany	LOCATION	, or by the Royal Danish Theatre , upon the life and thought of their respective nations , we can not escape the conclusion that such a school of good manners , of correct diction and pro- nunciation , of artistic stage presentation , and of literary art in one of its most important man - ifestations , would prove a force making in no slight degree for refinement and elevation , both intellectual and moral .

		And what is thus said of dramatic art applies with almost equal force to the art of music , the art that turns from treasons , stratagems and spoils the thoughts of men , to fix them upon worthier objects and higher aspirations .

		What the generosity of one gentleman of
Boston	LOCATION	has done for that city
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 might surely be done for this much larger com - munity by one of its far wealthier citizens .

		The endowment of a newspaper , for the two - fold purpose of providing a dignified and trust - worthy record of contemporary happenings , and of showing the public , by means of a convinc - ing object-lesson , what journalism ought to be , has been suggested more than once in the pages of THE DIAL .

		A recent article in '' The Fo - rum '' says : '' A great newspaper might be es - tablished and maintained by endowment , just as great universities are so established and maintained .

		The analogy between the two un - dertakings is very close ; with a suitable endow - ment forthcoming , there appears to be no reason why a Delane should not be found to accom - plish for a newspaper what President
Jordan	PERSON	and President
Harper	PERSON	have accomplished for the great new universities of the West . ''

		With this repetition of a suggestion that is likely sometime to bear fruit , we may close our dis - cussion of the endowment of culture .

		No mil - lionaire , oppressed by the responsibilities of his wealth , need despair of putting it to beneficent uses as long as such opportunities as we have above hinted at remain ungrasped .

		FRANCIS
PARKMAN	LOCATION	.

		For many years past , the popular consciousness has placed
Bancroft	PERSON	and
Prescott	PERSON	,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and Park - man , in a class by themselves , and assigned to them the highest rank among American historians .

		They are now all numbered with the dead ; for
Francis Parkman	PERSON	, the last of the quartet to remain with us , succumbed to a sudden illness on the eighth of this month .

		We have only space upon this occasion for a brief note upon his life and work .

		Born in
1823	DATE	, he celebrated his seventieth birthday a few weeks ago .

		He was graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1844	DATE	, and two years thereafter made an extensive trip to the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		The result of this trip was '' The
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	, '' his first book , published in
1847	DATE	.

		In
1851	DATE	appeared `` The Conspiracy of
Pontiac	LOCATION	. ''

		His third book was ''
Vassall Morton	PERSON	, '' a novel now forgotten , published in
1856	DATE	.

		The next ten years of his life were spent in the collection of material for his great historical work on ``
France	LOCATION	and En - gland in
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		The seven parts of this work appeared at intervals between
1866	DATE	and
1892	DATE	.

		They are entitled : `` The Pioneers of
France	LOCATION	in the New World '' -LRB- 1866 -RRB- ; `` The Jesuits in
North America	LOCATION	in the Seventeenth Century '' -LRB- 1868 -RRB- ; `` La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West '' -LRB-
1869	DATE	-RRB- ; `` The Old Regime in
Canada	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- ; `` Count Frontenac and
New France	LOCATION	under Louis XIV . ''

		-LRB- 1877 -RRB- ; ``
Montcalm	LOCATION	and Wolfe '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- ; and , last of all , `` A Half Century of Conflict '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- .

		A `` Book of Roses '' -LRB- 1866 -RRB- illustrates his interest in horticulture .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' pays the following tribute to the man and his works : '' His series of historical monographs are among the glories of American literature .

		They have
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's charm with far more than
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's accu - racy .

		They were produced in the midst of great physical suffering and disability , which never seemed to abate his powers of research or mar the sweet - ness of his temper .

		He belonged to a generation of
Boston	LOCATION	litterateurs of whom
Lowell	PERSON	was facile princeps , who never forgot that they were gentle - men as well as literary men , and upheld under all circumstances the tradition of personal dignity which came down from an earlier generation . ''

		ART AND LIFE ONCE MORE .

		There may not be much profit in discussing this question of style , form , art , as they are related to lit - erature , because very few persons seem to attach the same meaning to these words .

		* By style
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	evidently means some subtle grace or gloss , that even great writers do not attain to .

		He says
Wordsworth	PERSON	had 110 style ;
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, lacked style ; yet the works of these men he con - sidered the most important this century had to show .

		Arnold himself doubtless had style , in his own mean - ing of the term , a delicate distinction about his work , prose and verse , like that of cut glass .

		If
Emerson	PERSON	and Goethe lacked style , and Swift and Gray and
Arnold	PERSON	had it , the coming literature can get along very well without it .

		But it can not get along without that fresh , vital , and fragrant expres - sion , so aptly referred to by a recent writer in these pages.f Is it not true that the moment a man begins to take thought of his style as such as something apart , to be looked after on its own account , that moment he is lost ?

		With all true writers the mat - ter and the manner are one .

		The style is vital , and not something that can be put on at will .

		I like exceedingly a remark of Whitman 's upon this sub - ject .

		He says , as regards style , form , art , etc. , he has asked of them nothing but negative advantages '' that they should never impede me , and never under any circumstances , or for their own purposes only , assume any mastery over me . ''

		Such masters of expression as
Froude	PERSON	and Huxley say they take no thought of style .

		What they take thought of is the matter in hand .

		I once heard a woman who had written many books say to a well-known author , '' What I so much admire in your writing is that * Mr.
Hale	PERSON	, in THE DIAL for
November 1	DATE	, in commenting upon my view of Poe , in the preceding number , cautions us against the error we are likely to fall into if we neglect the study of style .

		His point is exceedingly well put , and his let - ter is itself as good as a specimen of simple and lucid style as one is likely to meet in many a day .

		It says the right thing right from his point of view in the best way .

		tMrs .


Celia P. Woolley	PERSON	, in THE DIAL for
October 16	DATE	.

		288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, wonderful style . '' ''

		I never think about my style , '' he replied ; `` I let that take care of itself . '' ''

		That is why I so admire it , '' she said .

		One of the latest stylists , Mr.
Walter Pater	PERSON	, ev - idently takes thought of wherewith his thought shall be clothed ; he does not consider the lilies of the field . ''

		He '' -LRB- the literary artist -RRB- , he says , '' moves slowly over his work , calculating the tenderest tones and restraining the subtlest curves , never let - ting hand or fancy move at large , gradually enforc - ing flaccid spaces to the highest degree of expres - sionship . ''

		This quotation from Mr.
Pater	PERSON	may serve to point the discontent I am going to give vent to in this paper ; namely , with the tendency , so marked in current criticism , to exalt the art of lit - erature above the function of literature , and in gen - eral to make a fetich of what is called Art with a big A. To me the function of literature is to deepen our enjoyment of life and to strengthen our mastery over its elements ; and this end is defeated or interfered with if we keep our attention so strongly fixed upon the art phase of the subject .

		It is doubtful if literature as an art was ever before so much studied and discussed as now .

		Writers were never before , it seems to me , so intent upon making an artistic impression , and making that an end in itself .

		Four-fifths of the poetry in the cur - rent magazines seems to have no other reason for its existence than art to make the impression of faultless art .

		The lesson of art as it relates to lit - erature , says Mr.
Pater	PERSON	, is that '' whatever becomes of the fruit , make sure of the flower and the leaves . ''

		Art is not even to stimulate to noble ends ; it has no end outside of itself .

		Why does not nature rest with flowers and leaves alone ?

		Because she abhors a barren fig tree ; and is not the poem or other work that seeks the flower of art alone a bar - ren fig tree ?

		I doubt if the old writers and poets thought of literature at all in its artistic aspects ; they thought of it as a medium of communicating life and power , or the truth of nature .

		The art - feeling , or art-spirit , seems to me of modern growth and the result of long ages of literary culture .

		It is in our time a kind of disease .

		In the older writers the attention is fixed upon life and the truths that relate to life ; in the new men the atten - tion is fixed upon art and the considerations that relate to art .

		Our poets are more in love with poetry than with things .

		There is a morbid crav - ing for the beautiful as it is known to art , instead of a wholesome love for it as it appears in the total scheme of things . ''

		It is the true breath of human - ity , '' says Renan , '' and not literary merit , that con - stitutes the beautiful . ''

		But we are more and more fixing our attention upon the literary merit , and making that an end in itself .

		The human note first , the art note second , seems the proper order .

		The fulness with which the poet speaks the common feeling and experiences of mankind is what finally tells . ''

		Unless the heart is shook , '' says
Landor	PERSON	, `` the gods thunder and stride in vain '' ; and the heart is only shook by heart power .

		In our day it seems much easier to strike the in - tellectual or the artistic note in poetry than the purely human note .

		The poets are more as schol - ars and craftsmen than they are as men .

		Seldom do we get a whiff , in current poetry , to say nothing of a full draught , of the simple , unadulterated , un - sophisticated human qualities .

		There may be art in escaping from art , and in moving the soul as na - ture does .

		Literature may appeal to our art-sense our sense of form and proportion , our sense of the polished and highly wrought ; it may appeal also to our life-sense our sense of real things , and our power to deal with them , our religious sense , our cosmic sense , our sense as simple human beings .

		There seems to be a tacit agreement among current critics that the appeal to our art-sense is the main matter ; if the poem pleases , like a beautiful statue or a piece of delicate carving , that is enough .

		And perhaps it is enough , for that kind of poetry the poetry of art ; but may there not be a larger kind , a poetry that shall have the flavor of life and real - ity ?

		We have in this country some exquisite art - poets verse-makers who are like master workmen in ivory : such delicate , such beautiful verbal carv - ing , such grace , such lightness and sureness of touch .

		The verse seems almost fragile from its exquisite workmanship .

		I have great pleasure in it , but it is purely the pleasure I have in art , and is not akin to the pleasure I have in life and in real things .

		It pleases like a perfume , and not like the breath of the fields or the woods or the shore .

		There is little recognition in current criticism of the legitimacy and value of work like
Whitman	PERSON	's , that aims to minimize , or escape entirely from , conscious exterior art the visible , palpable archi - tecture of verse and to tally the spirit of out-door nature , of growths , currents , cosmic and dynamic forces , and which in its form follows only the law of the inherent forms of organic nature .

		Such work is said to be without art , or to be outlawed of art ; as if to give the impression of the natural were less than to give the impression of the artificial ; as if to titillate our sense of form and measure were more than to quicken our sense of life and of things .

		It is interesting to note the strictures of Whitman 's critics and expounders in treating his attitude toward art .

		One of his most friendly and thorough-going champions , Mr.
William Clarke	PERSON	, says the effect of Whitman 's work is to '' stir our emotions , widen our interests , and rally the forces of our moral nature '' ; and yet he charges him with want of art , with lack of literary culture , etc. .

		By what name , then , shall we call the gift , or power , that enables him to pro- duce these effects from a printed poem ?

		If a writer `` endows us with the gift of life rather than with literature , '' has he not , after all , art of the most precious kind ?

		The true artist is seen in his atti - tude of soul his attitude of loving and impassioned contemplation of nature and man .

		It is not simply the attitude of the man who would know things or the reason of things the scientist , but of the man who would have an emotional and spiritual enjoy -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 ment of things and make others share in that en - joyment .

		It may he questioned if any great work of any kind sprang alone or primarily from the art impulse .

		Gothic and mediaeval art had their root in the religious impulse .

		In
Dante	PERSON	there was a burden of love and sorrow which the art impulse came to relieve .

		The ancient sculpture forever sur - passes the modern because those men were stirred by some deeper impulse than the art impulse the desire merely to copy the human body in stone ; a whole world of emotion , a whole phase of life , of which we know little , lies back of that matchless carving .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	lately , in lecturing upon the Poetry of Women , said that woman had fallen short of the highest achievements in poetry , because she was lacking in the art impulse .

		But it seems to me the art impulse the desire to realize in con - crete form some ideal is just as marked in
George Eliot	LOCATION	, or George Sand , or Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, as in any masculine genius ; and if these women failed , as Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	says they did , to attain to the highest results , it was from some deeper cause than feebleness of the art impulse .

		The mentality of woman is undoubt - edly stamped with her character , her limitations as woman her passive and receptive character , as op - posed to the aggressive and initiating character of man .

		It is not hers to beget or originate .

		Her work in literature rarely or never has the fertilizing , the kindling and quickening power of man 's .

		The creative , the generative principle is not hers , at least only in a very limited measure .

		Her artistic instincts are keen , but she rarely has the same pas - sionate grip of her subject that a man has of his .

		The self-constituted guardians of the popular taste always assume that the principles of art and poetry are forever fixed and settled .

		They talk authoritatively of the poet 's way or the artist 's way of doing things , as if there were a way for all poets and all artists .

		Given a new man , and there is a new way .

		Art follows the master , and does not lead him .

		He makes free with her , takes his will of her , and she bears him offspring in his own im - age .

		Art is not something arbitrary and despotic , to be set up over genius .

		It is what the poet makes it .

		There is , of course , good art and bad art ; but the principle I am contending for is the relativity of all art that the standards are of no authority , that the final tests are in the soul to-day , that that which tastes good to the soul to-day is good no mat - ter how much it diverge from the authorities of the past .

		The final justification of any work is to be sought in the soul and personality of the artist , and not in a set of rules deduced from other works .

		Is the work consistent with itself with the man and his aim ?

		does it exist for worthy ideal ends ?

		does it give us a fresh and vivid impression of reality ?

		is it plastic and creative ?

		does it unfold out of an inherent principle like a plant or tree ?

		that is , is it vital and characteristic ?

		What distinguishes the artist in letters from the mere thinker ?

		It is , as Sche * rer says , that vigorous sensuousness , that con - crete and immediate impression of things , which the former gives us , and which we never get from the latter .

		The modern growth in religion is meas - ured by our revolt against the standards against creeds and formulas ; and we shall match it in art when art ceases to be a fetich and becomes a life when we seek our tests within and not without .

		The dogmatic method in criticism and in religion has had its day .

		Poetic truth is not a fixed quan - tity , and a great poet may arise in fact , has arisen who is poet on new terms , and in apparent op - position to the standards .

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, COMMUNICA TIONS .

		CONCERNING LITERARY ART .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The remarks of Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	and Mrs.
Celia Parker Woolley	PERSON	, in THE DIAL for
Oct. 16	DATE	, are whole - some and instructive , and I do not appear here as a critic of either of them ; but there is a word still to be said , and I make this attempt to say it .

		There is some legitimate reason for a debate always going on over the value of art as such , or art as an end especially in literature .

		The debate arises out of the challenge to our admiration by an art which is only form , proportion , rhythm .

		It is bare justice to say that such art is rare .

		The poems of the English Swinburne and the
American Poe	ORGANIZATION	are marked examples of this kind of art , wherein the claims of the letter are exalted above those of the spirit .

		But surely
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	are as perfect in form , as rich in music ; and yet no one thinks of their art as defective in humanity or empty of thought and emotion .

		Art is an end in itself ; nothing within the scope of human achievement is better worth living and dying for .

		But art can not be mere form and music .

		The form and music express the human soul , or they fall short ; and of course the soul of the artist must be capable of living the sound thought and emotion which require perfect form and perfect music for their adequate expression .

		Still , on the other hand , a poet may have a sound hu - man heart , large , manly , and consecrated , and by sing - ing false just miss the highest achievement .

		Surely
Whittier	LOCATION	's grammatical and orthoepical shortcomings mar the effect of his richly emotional conceptions .

		Nor can we accept in any case evidence of high thought and strong feeling , however true both may be , as proof of great artistic powers .

		We want both the form and the content , the letter and the spirit , the feeling and its lyr - ical body .

		It would be an immense misfortune if a generation should arise to flout and neglect the forms of good art .

		I think it is a saying of
Wordsworth	PERSON	that the matter of writing comes very much out of the manner of it .

		Literature can not '' be real and strong and vital '' except within the fences of sober and graceful form .

		We are not yet healed of wounds inflicted by some con - spicuous violations of the formal demands of art . ''

		New ideals '' are always old ideals re-born .

		Homer ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, all worked in the harness of their art , and they live on unforgettable because they said better than forgotten men could say the everlasting truth of life and action .

		Let us hope that we are not , in the West , to be tortured by a replica of the old cant about new art , or by an apostolate of noble writing without correct writing , or by appeals to our admiration for lame verse or ungrammatical prose .

		To express both the mind and heart of man that is the purpose of literary art .

		And such expression , in prose or verse , is an end whenever the thought and feel - ing have soundness and universality .

		What
Clara Jane	PERSON	feels is worthy of literary expression only when her feel - ing is broadly human .

		If it were only
Clara Jane	PERSON	laugh - ing or crying , no one would care for the story of it .

		And if this maiden 's joy or grief is worth expressing , it is worth expressing in the best possible form .

		In the strict sense of things , no new expression of it is possible : whoever does it in the best way , the immortal fashion , will do it as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	would have done it .

		With all this , I affirm that human service , the further - ance of righteous ends , the practical helping of men and women , must follow from the creation of good art in letters .

		I count
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the front rank of ben - efactors .

		He enlightens and consoles all who really know him ; and that may be a higher service than se - curing votes for any cause .

		With President

		I believe I get the best

		I am ready to commend the spirit of energy the wonderful force and activity de - monstrated in the issuance of the progressive paper of to-day ; but I regret that this energy is not more directed toward the better ethics of a higher humanity .

		President
Adams	PERSON	's apology is all very true humiliat - ingly so , it seems to me that the cosmopolitan press is as high as its constituency , and no higher .

		And do we not here find a sufficient reason for the lost '' power of the press '' ?

		An intellectual leader must be above those he leads ; the moment he is not , he ceases to be a leader .

		Granting that the newspaper of the period is a true index of the intellectual and moral tone of the masses , is it meet that such a standard should obtain , even though strongly upheld by the powerful influences of commercialism ?

		Are there not still , in Anglo-Saxon blood , the virtues of honorable example , high impulse , and a spirit of progressive emulation ?

		And if so , must they ever be subverted to , and hidden by , pennyism and poundism ?

		I can not think a wisely-conducted movement in the better direction would be cheerless .

		Truly international in character , it prints articles in any one of the four languages English , French - , German , Dutch .

		It has been under an able editorial committee of ethno - graphers of many countries , with Mr.

		The articles published have been written by authorities and possess great value , while the illustrations have been extremely fine .

		As it was never self-supporting , the publisher , Mr.

		THE DIAL 291 JjOWELI/S TjETTERS .

		* Professor
Norton	PERSON	's edition of '' The Letters of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	'' is at last before us , and our rather rapid inspection of the work serves to confirm its a-priori claim to rank as the leading book of the year .

		That it has been put forth comparatively unheralded is a fact not perhaps unworthy of note .

		There have been no preliminary flourishes of newspaper trumpets , no advance tributes from known bell - wethers of opinion , no unworthy lures in the form of hints as to '' disclosures '' or other '' racy '' matters to be looked for in the inti - mate correspondence of our leading man of let - ters .

		Merit , in short , has been trusted to win its own way with a public too lightly held to be pecuniarily proof against it .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	's work is an admirable piece of literary construction a model of painstaking and strictly impersonal editing .

		The letters are divided into eleven chapters , each marking in a general way an epoch in Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's life ; the arrangement of the whole is chronological , and editorial writing is confined to the briefest of notes and to the sup - plying , in the first four chapters , of leading biographical facts .

		It has been the editor 's aim , in making his selection from the great mass of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's letters , '' to secure for it , so far as possible , an autobiographic charac - ter . ''

		In this he has been eminently success - ful .

		No similar collection with which we are acquainted comes so near to being a complete , satisfactory '' Life '' of the writer .

		We need scarcely say that Professor
Norton	PERSON	has made no editorial concessions to mere vulgar curios - ity . ''

		There was , '' he says , '' nothing in Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's life to be concealed or excused .

		But he had the reserves of a high and delicate nature , reserves to be no less respected after death than during life , and nothing will , I hope , be found in these volumes which he himself might have regretted to see in print . ''

		The series of letters extends from
1827	DATE	to
1891	DATE	, beginning with the artless essay of the child of eight , and closing with the half humor - ous plaint of the failing man with whom life is a retrospect , and whose chief concern seems to be to husband out its taper at the close .

		They form , as we have said , a remarkably com - * THE LETTERS OF

		plete biographical record ; yet in one point they seem curiously lacking .

		Rich as they are in criticism of men , of letters , of current events and issues , we find little in them of the deeper criticism of life , little to indicate that the writer gave -LRB- as we all know he did give -RRB- its gravest problems a serious thought .

		It may be partly with reference to this reserve that Professor
Norton	PERSON	says in his preface : '' Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, indeed , made to the public in his po - etry such revelation of his inward experiences and emo - tions as he alone had the right to make , and such as may well suffice to satisfy all legitimate interest in the spiritual development of the poet and in the nature of his most intimate and sacred human relations .

		Read together , his poems and his letters show him with rare completeness as he truly was . ''

		Perhaps Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	thought speculations as to the '' woher , wozu , undwohin '' out of place in let - ters to one 's friends ; but the fact remains that the impression one gets from the letters , taken by themselves , is that of a man whose interests were , in the best sense , of the world worldly .

		The present collection can not perhaps be bet - ter characterized than by saying that it fulfils anticipation .

		Since its announcement by the publishers , expectancy has been on the qui - vive ; and no one , we think that is , no one whose tastes are wholesome and whose opinion counts is likely to be disappointed .

		In range of topic , richness of literary criticism and allu - sion , and in penetration and large-mindedness of political judgments , the letters are such as no American save Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	himself could have written .

		The aim of this review will be best served , and our remaining space be most profitably filled , by letting the letters speak , so far as possible , for themselves .

		The references to
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, in a letter written in
1845	DATE	to
C. F. Briggs	PERSON	of '' The Broadway Jour - nal , '' are interesting : '' ... Poe , I am afraid , is wholly lacking in that ele - ment of manhood which , for want of a better name , we call character .

		It is something quite distinct from genius though all great geniuses are endowed with it .

		... As I prognosticated , I have made Poe my enemy by doing him a service .

		In the last ' Broadway Jour - nal ' he has accused me of plagiarism , and misquoted
Wordsworth	PERSON	to sustain his charge ... Poe wishes to kick down the ladder by which he rose .

		He is welcome .

		But he does not attack me at a weak point .

		He proba - bly ` can not conceive of anybody 's writing for anything but a newspaper reputation , or for posthumous fame , which is but the same thing magnified by distance .

		I have quite other aims . ''

		The nature of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's aims and his ideal of the poet 's function are indicated in the following noble passage in a letter written early in
1846	DATE	: 292 -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, '' ... My calling is clear to me .

		I am never lifted up to any peak of vision and moments of almost fear - ful illumination I have sometimes but that , when I look down in hope to see some valley of the
Beautiful Mountains	LOCATION	, I behold nothing but blackened ruins ; and the moans of the down-trodden the world over but chiefly here in our own land come up to my ear , in - stead of the happy songs of the husbandmen reaping and binding the sheaves of light ; yet these , too , I hear not seldom .

		Then I feel how great is the office of poet , could I but even dare to hope to fill it .

		Then it seems as if my heart would break in pouring out one glorious song that should be the gospel of Reform , full of con - solation and strength to the oppressed , yet falling gently and restoringly as dew on the withered youth-flowers of the oppressor .

		That way my madness lies , if any .

		Were I to hang my harp -LRB- if we moderns may keep the metaphor , at least , of the old poets after losing their spirit -RRB- on a tree surrounded only by the very sweetest influence of
summer	DATE	nature , and the wind should breathe through its strings , I believe they would sound with a warlike clang . ''

		Brave words !

		though , it must be confessed , words of very moderate fulfilment .

		It is scarcely as the Tyrtasus of down-trodden humanity that we are accustomed to think of the writer .

		That reputation even '' newspaper reputation , '' the despised ideal of characterless Poe was not indifferent to him , is manifest in an earlier series of letters to
G. B. Loring	PERSON	: '' ... I am going to write a tragedy .

		I have the plot nearly filled out .

		I think I know it will be good .

		It will be psycho - historical .

		I think also of writing a prose tale , which perhaps will appear in chapters in the -LRB- ` Southern Literary -RRB- Messenger ' if White will pay me ... If I do n't die ,

		My book does as well as can be expected .

		All the notices of it have been very favorable except that of your honest friend and fellow-politician , the editor of the < Post , ' who blackguarded me roundly . ''

		In a letter to the editor , dated
1867	DATE	, Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	gives his impressions of Emerson : `` Emerson 's oration '' -LRB- before the Phi Beta Kappa Society -RRB- `` was more disjointed than usual , even with him .

		It began nowhere and ended everywhere , and yet , as always with that divine man , it left you feeling that something beautiful had passed that way some - thing more beautiful than anything else , like the rising and setting of stars .

		Every possible criticism might have been made on it but one that it was not noble .

		There was a tone in it that awakened all elevating asso - ciations .

		He boggled , he lost his place , he had to put on his glasses ; but it was as if a creature from some fairer world had lost its way in our fogs , and it was our fault , not his .

		It was chaotic , but it was all such stuff as stars are made of , and you could n't help feeling that , if you waited awhile , all that was nebulous would be whirled into planets , and would assume the mathemat - ical gravity of system .

		All through it I felt something in me that cried < Ha , ha , to the sound of the trumpets ! ' ''

		Emerson once told Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	a droll story of Alcott : '' He -LRB-
Emerson	LOCATION	-RRB- asked the Brahmin what he had to show for himself , what he had done , in short , to justify his having been on the earth . '

		If Pythagoras came to
Concord	LOCATION	, whom would he wish to see ? '

		demanded the accused triumphantly . ''

		In a letter to
James B. Thayer	PERSON	, dated
1883	DATE	, Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, after noting
Emerson	PERSON	's singular insensibility to the harmony of verse , says of his prose : '' I liked particularly what you say about his mastery of English .

		No man , in my judgment , ever had a greater , and I greatly doubt whether
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	is quite capable -LRB- in the habit of addressing a jury as he always is -RRB- of estimating the style of one who con - versed with none but the masters of his mother-tongue .

		Emerson 's instinct for the best word was infallible .

		Whenever he found one he froze to it , as we say in our admirable vernacular .

		I have sometimes found that he had added to his cabinet the one good word in a book he had read .

		... I think that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, like Renan -LRB- who has had an evil influence over him -RRB- , is apt to think the super & ne as good as the fine , or even bet - ter than that . ''

		The letters are rich in personal allusions and characterizations , and the only case in which the writer 's good temper seems to desert him is in a note on
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	: '' She is a very foolish , conceited woman , who has got together a great deal of information , but not enough knowledge to save her from being ill-tempered . ''

		President
Hayes	PERSON	and his wife fare better : '' ... Mrs.
Hayes	PERSON	also pleased me very much .

		She has really beautiful eyes , full of feeling and intelligence , and bore herself with a simple good - humor that was perfectly well-bred .

		A very good American kind of princess , I thought .

		Do n't fancy I am taken off my feet by the enthusiasm of contagion .

		You know I am only too fastidious , and am too apt to be put at a dis - advantage by the impartiality of my eyes .

		No , I am sure that both the President and his wife have in them that excellent new thing we call Americanism , which I suppose is that ' dignity of human `` nature ' which the philosophers of the last century were always seeking and never finding , and which , after all , consists , perhaps , in not thinking yourself either better or worse than your neighbors by reason of any artificial distinction .

		As I sat behind them at the concert the other night , I was profoundly touched by the feeling of this kingship with - out mantle and crown from the property-room of the old world .

		Their dignity was in their very neighborli - ness , instead of in their distance , as in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Regarding President
Cleveland	LOCATION	, Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	wrote , in
1887	DATE	, to Mr.
E. W. Gilder	PERSON	: '' To me his personality is very simpatico .

		He is a truly American type of the best kind a type very dear to me , I confess . ''

		Another refer - ence to the President , in a letter written shortly after the writer 's political '' decapita - tion '' in
1885	DATE	, is worth quoting : ''

		A letter to Professor
Norton	PERSON	from
London	LOCATION	,
1888	DATE	, contains a very characteristic passage touching the famous
Sackville	PERSON	incident : '' The
Sackville	PERSON	squall has amused me a good deal , bringing out so strangely as it did the English genius for thinking the rest of mankind unreasonable .

		One is reminded of the old story of the madman who thought himself alone in his sanity .

		I seldom care to discuss anything most things seem so obvious , least of all with the average Briton , who never is willing to take any - thing for granted and whose eyes are blind to all side - lights .

		Yes , there is one thing they always take for granted , namely , that an American must see the supe - riority of
England	LOCATION	.

		They have as little tact as their totem the bull .

		I have come to the edge of my temper several times over the
Sackville	LOCATION	business always in - troduced by them .

		` All
Europe	LOCATION	is laughing at you , you know , ' said Sir to me genially the other day . '

		That is a matter of supreme indifference to us , ' I replied blandly , though with a keen temptation to pull a pair of ears so obtrusively long .

		But with all that there is a manliness about them I heartily like .

		Tact , after all , is only a sensitiveness of nerve , and there is but a hair 's - breadth between this and irritability . ''

		As an example of the lighter vein in which many of the letters are written , we subjoin a note written from

E. G. J. AMERICAN	PERSON	PUBLIC SCHOOLS .

		* The reputation of the public-school system of the
United States	LOCATION	has hitherto received no such damaging blow as that dealt by Dr.
J. M. Rice	PERSON	in a series of articles published in '' The Forum '' from
October , 1892	DATE	, to
June , 1893	DATE	.

		These articles were received with much sur - prise by a large part of the public , naively con - fident until now that American schools , like American pork and sewing-machines , were the best in the world .

		In public-school circles they created no little indignation , together with a certain amount of consternation .

		The arti - cles have now appeared in book form , with the addition of a second part illustrating some of the excellent work done by pupils in the schools of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, La Porte ,
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, and in the
Cook County	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 111 . -RRB-

		Normal School ; these schools , even in the author 's critical judgment , being really good .

		Dr.
Rice	PERSON	, who is a specialist in pedagogy and has personally inspected the schools of Ger - many and other European countries , undertook , with the support of '' The Forum , '' a tour of visitation of the schools in the principal cities of this country .

		Thirty-six cities in all were visited , the tour consuming twenty-four weeks , during which , with few exceptions , every school hour was spent in school-rooms .

		In his pub - lished review of these schools , Dr.
Rice	PERSON	is severe where severe criticism is necessary , laud - atory where praise is possible , and always con - structive as well as destructive .

		When the schools are bad he shows us where in his opin - ion the source of the evil lies and how it may be remedied .

		He found that a surprisingly large proportion of the cities which he visited have poor schools .

		A poor school is one in which the present happiness of the child is not considered ; where purely mechanical and mem - oriter methods are permitted ; and where mere familiarity with words and forms and facts is accepted for education .

		A good school is one where the child is taught to observe , to think , and to do ; where reading , writing , and arith - metic are taught interestingly in connection with natural science ; where the child is happy and the teacher enthusiastic ; where discipline is by love ; and where the child is allowed physically and mentally to expand .

		To the first class belong for the most part the schools of

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, kee ,
Worcester	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- , the primary schools of
Boston	LOCATION	, and a few others .

		To the second class belong the schools of La Porte , Indian - apolis ,
Minneapolis	LOCATION	and St.
Paul	PERSON	, and the grammar-schools of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Of intermediate character are the schools of other cities visited but reported less in detail .

		The author sup - ports his opinion of the above schools by a convincing array of his actual observations .

		Instances of unscientific and even barbarous teaching that he cites can not be excused as ex - ceptions , first , because there are too many of them ; and , second , because '' the degree of excellence of a school system is represented , not by what is done by those teachers who are suf - ficiently interested to do more than is required of them , but by the degree of inferiority that the teaching may reach and yet be accepted as satisfactory . ''

		A school in
New York City	LOCATION	, whose principal has been marked uniformly '' excellent '' every year for the last twenty-five years , is described in part as follows : '' The principal of this school has pedagogical views and a maxim peculiarly her own .

		She believes that when a child enters upon school-life , his vocabulary is so small that it is practically worthless , and his power to think so feeble that his thoughts are worthless .

		She is consequently of the opinion that what the child knows and is able to do on coming to school should be entirely disregarded ; that he should not be allowed to waste time , either in thinking or in finding his own words to express his thoughts , but that he should be supplied with ready-made thoughts as given in a ready-made vocabu - lary .

		She has therefore prepared sets of questions and answers , so that the child may be given in concise form most of the facts prescribed in the course of study for the three years of primary instruction .

		The instruction throughout the school consists principally of grinding these answers verbatim into the minds of the children .

		The principal 's ideal lies in giving each child the ability to answer without hesitation , upon leaving her school , every one of the questions formulated by her .

		In order to reach the desired end , the school has been converted into the most dehumanizing institution that I have ever laid eyes upon , each child being treated as if he pos - sessed a memory and the faculty of speech , but no in - dividuality , no sensibilities , no soul . ''

		So much concerning the pedagogical views on which this school is conducted ; now as to the maxim .

		This maxim consists of three short words ' Save the min - utes . '

		The spirit of the school is , ' Do what you like with the child , immobilize him , automatize him , dehu - manize him , but save , save the minutes . '

		In many ways the minutes are saved .

		By giving the child ready - made thoughts , the minutes required in thinking are saved .

		By giving the child ready-made definitions , the minutes required in formulating them are saved .

		Every - thing is prohibited that is of no measurable advantage to the child , such as the movement of the head or a limb , when there is no logical reason why it should be moved at the time .

		I asked the principal whether the chil - dren were not allowed to move their heads .

		She answer - ed , ` Why should they look behind when the teacher is in front of them ? '

		words too logical to be refuted . ''

		During the recitations many minutes are saved .

		The principal has indeed solved the problem of how the greatest number of answers may be given in the small - est number of minutes .

		In the first place , no time is spent in selecting pupils to answer questions , every reci - tation being started by the first pupil in the class , the children then answering in turn , until all have recited .

		Secondly , time is economized in the act of rising and sitting during the recitations , the children being so drilled that the child who recites begins to fall back into his seat while uttering the last word of a definition , the next succeeding child beginning his ascent while the one before him is in the act of descending .

		Indeed , things appear as if the two children occupying adjoin - ing seats were sitting upon the opposite poles of an in - visible see-saw , so that the descending child necessarily raises the pupil next him to his feet .

		Then , again , the minutes are saved by compelling the children to unload their answers as rapidly as possible , distinctness of ut - terance being sacrificed to speed , and to scream their answers at the tops of their voices , so that no time may be wasted in repeating words inaudibly uttered .

		For example , the principal 's definition of a note ' A note is a sign representing to the eye the length or duration of time ' is ideally delivered , when it sounds some - thing like ' Notsinrepti length d'ration time . ' ''

		Truly , in such processes the minutes are saved , but the soul of the child is lost .

		The above is typical of many schools visited in
New York	LOCATION	and other cities .

		In
New York City	LOCATION	the cause of the inferiority of the schools is appar - ent .

		The appointment of teachers is a matter of political '' jobbery , '' and a teacher once in , be she good or evil , is in to stay .

		If she pos - sesses any kind of '' pull '' at all , her removal is practically impossible .

		Then the supervis - ion is very scanty one superintendent with only eight assistants to supervise the work of four thousand teachers .

		Finally , the people at large take no active interest in their schools .

		In
Baltimore	LOCATION	things were worse .

		Khyth - mical concert recitations of abstract numbers passed for instruction in arithmetic .

		Reading was purely mechanical , often without expres - sion , inflection , or even a pause at a comma or period .

		Here are two gems from this city : '' I asked one of the primary principals whether she believed in the professional training of teachers . '

		I do not , ' she answered emphatically . '

		I speak from expe - rience .

		A graduate of the
Maryland Normal School	ORGANIZATION	once taught under me , and she was n't as good a teacher as those who came from the
High School	ORGANIZATION	. '

		`` One of the primary teachers said to me : ' I for - merly taught in the higher grades , but I had an attack of nervous prostration some time ago , and the doctor recommended rest .

		So I now teach in the primary , be - cause teaching primary children does not tax the mind . ' ''

		And yet the citizens of
Baltimore	LOCATION	glory in the fact that their schools are among the best in the country .

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 From the several accounts of irrational teach - ing at
Buffalo	LOCATION	and
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, we quote only a part of a spelling-lesson at
Buffalo	LOCATION	: '' The teacher here remarked , ' We will now write the words . ' ''

		This announcement was followed by a considerable amount of bustle and confusion on the part of the chil - dren , and order was not restored until slates , pencils , and rulers had been placed in position .

		When all was quiet one of the pupils called out : '' ' I ai n't got no ruler . ' ''

		In answer to this , the teacher , without correcting or even paying the slightest attention to the incorrect language that had been used by the child , said to him : '' ' You do n't need a ruler .

		Do it the way you done it yesterday . ' ''

		Then the words of the oft-repeated list were slowly dictated by the teacher .

		When the word ' steal ' was reached , she remarked : '' ' Spell the '' steal '' you spelled
this morning	TIME	, not the `` steel '' you spelled yesterday . ' ''

		When the word ' their ' was reached , the teacher asked , ' How do you spell '' their '' ? ' '' '

		T-h-e-i-r their , ' sang the children . '' '

		What kind of a '' t '' do you use in their ? ' ''

		Capital '' t , '' ' one of the pupils answered . '' '

		That 's right , ' said the teacher . ''

		One of the children here remarked , melodiously : '' / ca n't make no cap - i tal t. '' '' / kin '' sang another . ''

		Here the teacher said to me , ' They do n't use capi - tal letters regularly in this class ; I only let them use capitals when they write proper names and proper things . ' ''

		That the schools of
America	LOCATION	have not yet wholly passed out of the stage of barbarism , the following from
St. Louis	LOCATION	will show : '' During several daily recitation periods , each of which is from twenty to twenty-five minutes in duration , the children are obliged to stand on the line , perfectly mo - tionless , their bodies erect , their knees and feet together , the tips of their shoes touching the edge of a board in the floor .

		The slightest movement on the part of a child attracts the attention of the teacher .

		The recita - tion is repeatedly interrupted with cries of ' Stand straight , ' ` Do n't bend the knees , ' ` Do n't lean against the wall , ' and so on .

		I heard one teacher ask a little boy , ' How can you learn anything with your knees and toes out of order ? '

		The toes appear to play a more important part than the reasoning faculties .

		The teacher never forgets the toes ; every few moments she casts her eyes ' toe - ward . ' ''

		Although the schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	belong to the mechanical and unscientific order , and al - though in some of them the author found the most absurd teaching and pedagogical '' meth - ods of the most ancient type , '' yet under the present superintendent he sees promise of bet - ter things .

		The principal cause of the low standard of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools is a lack of professional strength on the part of the teach - ers .

		As remedies , he suggests professional training-schools for the preparation of new teachers , and educational supervision for the three thousand teachers at present employed .

		Of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools in general , Dr.
Rice	PERSON	says : '' The amount of objective work is extremely limited , even in the lower grades , and the sciences are not in - cluded in the curriculum .

		In the lowest primary grade the work is particularly dry and mechanical .

		With the exception of a little singing , the pupils during the first six months do nothing but read , write , and cipher all day long .

		There is not even a recess to break the mo - notony .

		Owing to lack of accommodation in the rap - idly-growing districts , a number of the primaries have been converted into half-day schools , some of the pu - pils attending in the
morning	TIME	, while others attend in the
afternoon	TIME	.

		In some of the half-day schools the pupils do not even cipher during the first six months , all their time being devoted to reading and writing .

		The busy - work consists largely of copying words either from a book or from the board .

		The methods employed in teaching reading vary in the different schools .

		In some instances the pupils are taught by the word method , in others by the sentence method , and in still others by a variety of methods , including phonics and word build - ing .

		As a rule , I found the reading and the writing in the lower grades poor , in spite of the fact that so much time had been devoted to these subjects . ''

		The schools of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	are described , to show how quickly good schools may be built up when the superintendent is acquainted with modern pedagogical methods and is enthusias - tic , and when the school management is sep - arated from politics .

		The course of study here is based on the principle of unification , by which is meant such a combination of the branches pursued at one time that each shall contribute to the interest and understanding of the other .

		The following example will serve as an illustration : The young child , upon entering the primary department , begins , not the study of reading and writing , but some natural sci - ence , say botany , in a simple and interesting way ; and in connection with this , apparently as an incident , learns to read , and write , and draw , and to use numbers .

		He counts the flower 's petals , he draws its form upon paper , he describes it in oral and written words , and he reads its printed description .

		At the same time the child is encouraged to observe objects of nature and their changes and to report his observations , to think about them and to re - cord his thoughts .

		The following composition , written by a child who had attended a
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	primary school only seven months , is one of 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, many equally good .

		The observations were his own . ''

		I have a pasque flower .

		The stamens are yellow .

		The stem is short .

		There are many stamens .

		My flower wears an overcoat . ''

		In the schools of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	it is shown how a child may be educated without putting him in a straight - jacket or depriving him of his natural rights .

		Here , too , it is shown how , with enthusiastic teachers and interested pu - pils , the number of subjects taught in the pri - mary grades may be greatly enlarged , and yet at the end of a given time the children be more proficient in the three R 's than by the old nar - row mechanical method .

		It is further shown in
Minneapolis	LOCATION	how the children of poor immi - grants may , by joining love and sympathy with a little pedagogical science , be taught to speak and read without the contortions and grimaces practised in some of the Bohemian schools in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		One of the problems of the primary teacher is what to have the children do while she is engaged with other children .

		In the mechanical schools the '' busywork '' consists in the drudgery of copying over and over a set form of words , or in writing again and again such nonsense as 00 + 000 = 00000 , or in the soul-deadening process of '' studying '' when eyes and lips are following the printed page with interest and attention absent .

		In the few good schools which Dr.
Rice	PERSON	discovered , the busywork was not of this kind , but the child was engaged in something to awaken his thought , to sustain his interest , or to train his hand .

		In a word , the trouble with the schools of the
United States	LOCATION	seems to be poorly qualified teachers .

		And the cause of this trouble is three - fold : first , a lack of active interest in the pub - lic schools on the part of the public ; second , political considerations in the appointment of teachers ; third , the want of adequate super - vision .

		In any city these causes may be re - moved .

		In some cities this has been accom - plished , and the result has been an improve - ment that was wonderful indeed .

		In recent times the science of education has so far ad - vanced that it needs only favorable objective conditions to vindicate its power .

		The board of education must be severed from politics ; the superintendent who , it is hardly neces - sary to say , must be a scientist in pedagogy should have power to secure the election of qualified teachers and the dismissal of unqual - ified ones ; he must , furthermore , have assist - ants enough to provide for thorough supervis - ion of all the schools and teachers , a part of this supervision to be educational , that is , the teachers themselves must , by means of teach - ers ' meetings , classes , and clubs , be brought up and kept up to a high educational standard .

		We have nothing but praise for Dr.
Rice	PERSON	's book .

		It is healthfully stimulating throughout .

		It is true that a still more radical standard of criticism of our prevalent educational principles is needed , but at present we are not far enough along to profit by such criticism .

		Could we lift ourselves up to the standard set forth in this work , we might get strength of mind to look farther .

		Then a new prophet will be timely , who shall ask us hard questions about some of the fundamental articles of our orthodox peda - gogical faith .

		Perchance he shall ask us why we ever considered that the first and chiefest studies in our school curriculum should be read - ing , writing , arithmetic , and geography ; by what authority we made instruction in music , morals , conversation , natural science , and phys - ical and manual training subordinate to these ; why we took it for granted that the great ma - jority of public-school teachers must be women ; why we never doubted that the little ones must sit for consecutive hours in straight rows , pinned in between a wooden seat and desk ; why we believed that a school should be con - ducted wholly indoors ; and why , finally , we approved mainly of the plan of learning les - sons from a printed book and reciting them to a teacher .

		Before such a prophet , perchance , we shall stand with fear and trembling , unable to give a reason for the faith that is in us .

		Mighty Book-Hunters , '' Dr.
Burton	PERSON	called his little clan ; and '' mighty '' collectors are marshalled in the Elton clan .

		We find here scarcely any mention of the present-day Glad - stones and Locker-Lampsons , but of those clas - sic fellows who `` found time to discuss the mer - its of the authors before the Flood '' we have a plenty .

		But of all these , and of many others besides , Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	give us much pleasant and in - structive gossip . ''

		It pleased the Greeks to invent traditions about the books of Poly - crates , '' the tyrant of Samos who usurped the royal power about 532 B.C. ; but the splendors of the private library began only about 100 years
B.C.	LOCATION	, in the days of Lucullus .

		Seneca , though a millionaire , complained bitterly of the pomp of Lucullus , and rejoiced at the de - struction of
Alexandria	LOCATION	's treasures . ''

		Our idle book-hunters , '' he said , '' know about nothing but titles and bindings ; their chests of cedar and ivory , and the book-cases that fill the bath - room , are nothing but fashionable furniture , and have nothing to do with learning . ''

		The Roman stoic would doubtless throw up his hands in holy horror at the contents of a Sher - aton Shrine , or
M. James Rothschild	PERSON	's hun - dred books worth
$ 200,000	MONEY	, yet find solace in our '' bulged and bruised octavos '' of to-day .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	have grouped the great collectors of
England	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and Ger - many under several headings , and have brought together various schools , classified as '' Royal Collectors , '' ''
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	and his Successors , '' 44 De Thou
Pinelli Peiresc	PERSON	, '' and the like .

		In the dark ages , when learning was at a low ebb , there were not many great collectors of books .

		`` The knowledge of books might al - most have disappeared in the
seventh century	DATE	, when the cloud of ignorance was darkest , but for a new and remarkable development of learn - ing in the Irish monasteries . ''

		But the books of the monks , like those that had preceded them , were few and costly ; and although the collectors who lived and conducted their pious enterprises of hoarding the sacred memorials of their ancestors , from the seventh century down to the beginning of the sixteenth fifty years after the dawn of the art ' of printing are brought together with scrupulous care by Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	, we do not find among them many names great from the point of view of a collector of to-day , with a signal excep - tion here and there , such as Richard de Bury , 44 who had more books than all the other
Bish	PERSON	- ops of
England	LOCATION	, '' until we reach
Maioli	PERSON	and
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	and De Thou , who are still the patron saints of those who love books for books ' sake .

		When Pope
Nicholas V.	PERSON	, who came into power in
1447	DATE	, founded the
Vatican Library	ORGANIZATION	and endowed it with five thousand volumes , books were still worth their weight in precious stones .

		He opened his Greek treasure-house to the Western World , and gathered about him a set of scholars who were kept busy en - riching the world 's store of knowledge .

		He obtained the '' Commentary upon St. Mat - thew , '' of which
Erasmus	PERSON	made use in his Par - aphrase , and of which
Aquinas	PERSON	wrote that he 44 would rather have a copy than be master of the city of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		Wanting to read Homer in Latin verse , and '' to get a version of the Iliad and Odyssey , he gave a large retaining fee , a palazzo , and a farm in the
Campagna	LOCATION	, and made a deposit of ten thousand pieces of gold to be paid on the completion of the con - tract . ''

		Another great Italian collector was
Antonio Magliabecchi	PERSON	, whose portrait has been engraved for Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	's book .

		Early in life a jeweller 's shop-boy , who never left
Florence	LOCATION	, he in time became renowned through - out the world for his knowledge of books .

		His memory was so trustworthy and his information so exact that he was believed to know the hab - itat of all the rare books in the world ; yet he has been despised as '' a man who lived on titles and indexes , and whose very pillow was a folio . ''

		He left to the library that bears his name about 30,000 volumes of his own collecting .


Germany	LOCATION	had its early collectors also , among whom , to mention only two , were Pirckheimer -LRB- whose book-plate was engraved by Diirer -RRB- and
Henri Estienne	PERSON	's friend
Ulric Fugger	PERSON	, whose library was '' said to contain as many books as there were stars in heaven . ''

		Among the great collectors in
England	LOCATION	are names more or less familiar to us from the libraries they founded
Bodley	PERSON	,
Harley	LOCATION	, Sel - den , Cotton .

		But in
France	LOCATION	bibliophiles and collectors have , since the time of
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	, been as numerous as the books in
Ulric Fugger	PERSON	's library .

		One great French name seems to have fallen out of Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	's galaxy - that of the
Comtesse de Verrue	ORGANIZATION	, who , what - 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, ever may have been her shortcomings morally , deserves to be mentioned along with the de Pompadours and other royal book-lovers .

		This lively dame left an epitaph on herself , thus rudely translated by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	: `` Here lies , in sleep secure , A dame inclined to mirth , Who , by way of making sure , Chose her paradise on earth . ''

		No book-collector has left behind him a name more revered in all ways than
Jean Grolier	PERSON	, whose fame is due , however , not more to his love of literature than to his delicate and re - fined taste in the decoration of the covers of his books . ''

		They looked , '' said one enthusiast , '' as if the muses had taken the outsides into their charge , as well as the contents , they were adorned with such art and esprit , and looked so gay , with a delicate gilding quite unknown to the bookbinders of our time . ''

		The collectors of
Spain	LOCATION	embrace one great name of pertinent interest to our readers , that of
Don Ferdinand	PERSON	, the son of
Christopher Co	ORGANIZATION	- lumbus and
Donna Beatrix Enriquez	PERSON	.

		He was one of the most celebrated bibliophiles in
Europe	LOCATION	, and the founder of the library at Se - ville , '' La Columbina . ''

		This library is still in existence , and contains some of the books of the great admiral , which bear his marginal notes one of especial interest and value , the
Imago Mundi	ORGANIZATION	, in which he wrote , anent the Portuguese discoveries , '' in all which things I had my share . ''

		In Mr. and Mrs.
Elton	PERSON	's scholarly book there is so much to praise that we hesitate to point out such small defects as typographical errors , but these -LRB- pp. 32 and 84 -RRB- should disappear from subsequent editions ; and on pages 219 and 220 ,

IRVING SALVINI	PERSON	'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* More than ordinary interest attaches to the publication of the autobiography of a contem - poraneous artist like
Tomasso Salvini	PERSON	, cel
$	MONEY	- brated alike in the old world and the new .

		The appearance of this volume first in the English language , and its issue from an American pub - lishing house , attest
Salvini	PERSON	's recognition of
America	LOCATION	's appreciation of the classic drama as interpreted by the foremost actor of his time .

		The dramatic art has overcome all obstacles and prejudices since the time of Shakespeare ; * LEAVES FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF TOMMASO SAL - VINI .


New York	LOCATION	: The
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		and in
Salvini	LOCATION	's case it has risen superior even to the limitation of language , for nowhere has he found more intelligent consideration than among the American people , to the mass of whom the language he speaks is entirely un - familiar .

		Of this he himself testifies through - out his book , which he practically closes with the following eloquent tribute : `` As I left that hospitable land -LSB-
America	LOCATION	-RSB- behind me , and saw the great statue of Liberty fade gradually from my sight , I felt a pang in my soul , and , if my eyes were dry , my heart wept .

		I made a salute to that country whose people are so full of vigor , industry , and courage , and who lack neither culture nor understand - ing nor feeling .

		May the
United States	LOCATION	receive the salutation of a humble artist who while his heart beats will feel for that nation respect and love . ''

		There is perhaps a feeling of disappointment that
Salvini	PERSON	's autobiography should follow so closely the form of a diary ; but probably this could not have been otherwise .

		Salvini is an actor , not a writer .

		At the same time , there is much compensation in the fact that this style reveals the characteristics of the man , which include notably vanity , generosity , persistence , concentration , and , above all , a spirit of justice to himself and others . ''

		I have the conscience to confess , '' he says , '' that I have not always risen to the height of my own conception .

		I have never had a more severe critic than my - self in matters pertaining to my art . ''

		Yet he recounts his numerous triumphs with an in - genuous glow of language which brings a smile to the lips of the reader .

		But as an insight into the character of the man who writes his own biography is the greatest favor he can con - fer upon his readers ,
Salvini	PERSON	's candor is rather commendable than blameworthy .

		It should also be noted that he writes of other great art - ists whom he has seen Ristori ,
Rossi	PERSON	,
Rachel	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, and others in the same spirit of enthusiasm .

		He has kept in mind the purpose of doing some good with his book , for in many passages there is valuable advice to members of his pro- fession ; and in one place he says : '' The chief object of these memoirs is to make it known to anyone whom it may aid , how a young man , without inherited resources , and constrained to look out for himself from very early years , can , by upright con - duct , firm resolution , and assiduous effort , acquire in time some renown and the means for enjoying the com - forts of life in his old age without being dependent on anybody . ''

		Among the most interesting parts of Sal - vini 's book are those which relate to his own methods of study and delineation of character on the stage , to the various characteristics of

		THE DIAL 299 the different schools of acting , and to the chief characteristics of the audiences he has met in remote parts of the globe .

		In speaking of his first attempts in the composite experiment of presenting his plays he speaking Italian and the others English he says : '' The exactitude with which the subsequent rehears - als of ' Othello ' and those of ' Hamlet ' proceeded was due to the memory , the application , and the scrupulous attention of the American actors , as well as my own force of will , and to the natural intuition which helped me to know without understanding what was addressed to me , divining it from a motion , a look , or a light in - flection of the voice . ''

		Perhaps this and other testimonials to the mer - its of American actors , coming from such an exacting artist as
Salvini	PERSON	, may persuade Amer - ican audiences to estimate more highly the American efforts in the dramatic art .

		Of American audiences in general , he says : '' The theatrical audiences are serious , attentive to details , analytical I might almost say scientific , and one might fancy that such careful critics had never in their lives done anything but occupy themselves with scenic art .

		... It is surprising that in a land where in - dustry and commerce seem to absorb all the intelligence of the people there should be in every city and district , indeed in every village , people who are competent to discuss the arts with such high authority ... The taste and critical faculty of the public are in their ful - ness of vigor .

		Old
Europe	LOCATION	is more bound by traditions , more weary , more blase , in her judgment , not always sincere or disinterested . ''

		Of the conscientious devotion which
Salvini	PERSON	brought to his art , some notion may be formed from his treatment of a part which he had al - ready mastered as to words , character , and ac - tion .

		He says : '' I wished , however , to avoid fixing an immature con - ception in my mind , and I let it lie for several months , so that I might form fresh impressions upon taking it up again .

		There is no better rule in art than not to permit one 's self to be carried away by a first impulse .

		When time is taken for reflection , one 's conceptions are always more correct . ''

		Again he says : '' While I was busying myself with the part of
Saul	PERSON	, ' I read and reread the
Bible	LOCATION	, so as to become impreg - nated with the appropriate sentiments , manners , and local color .

		When I took up ' Othello ' I pored over the history of the
Venetian Republic	ORGANIZATION	and that of the Moorish invasion of
Spain	LOCATION	; I studied the passions of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, their art of war , their religious beliefs ; nor did I overlook the romance of
Giraldi Cinthio	PERSON	, in order the better to master that sublime character . ''

		In referring elsewhere to the Moor of
Venice	LOCATION	, he says : '' It is very seldom that I have attained satisfaction with myself in that role I may say that in the thou - sands of times I have played it , I can count on the fingers of one hand those when 1 have said to myself , ' I can do no better . ' ''

		These brief extracts will be sufficient to reveal to the uninitiated that a great dramatic repre - sentation , which they enjoy for two or three hours of an idle evening , is frequently the re - sult of serious application for years on the part of the actor who entrances them .

		Salvini 's accounts of the different receptions he has had at the hands of various audiences are very interesting .

		Of an Italian audience on a certain occasion , he writes : `` Then came a tempest of cries and plaudits , and countless summonses before the curtain .

		When the demonstration was ended , the audience passed out amid the indistinct murmur of voices , and collected in groups of five , eight , or twelve , everywhere in the neighbor - hood of the theatre ; then , reuniting as if by magnetic force , they came back into the theatre , demanded the relighting of the footlights , and insisted that I should come back on the stage again , though I was half un - dressed , to receive a new ovation . ''

		Of a South American public he writes : `` When I reached the street two bands struck up , and a great shout of '
Viva Salvini	PERSON	! '

		arose from the throats of a crowd numbering thousands .

		The streets through which I was to pass were strewn with flowers , the windows were hung with draperies , and filled with ladies and children , who threw down flowers ; as to the men , they were either in the procession or standing at the doors of their houses , holding their hats in the air and shouting . ''

		But these wild manifestations are not confined to the Latin races .

		Of a Russian audience
Salvini	PERSON	says that it demands the appearance of a successful actor before the curtain '' fifteen , twenty , or even thirty times , '' and he adds : '' Not content with that , they wait for you at the door , no matter how long it may take you to dress , and stand in lines before you for you to pass between , begging a look , or a touch of your hand ; and , if you live so near by as not to need a carriage , they accompany you on foot to the door of your lodgings , with open manifesta - tions of sympathy . ''

		All of which is very strange to the more phlegmatic American audience , even at the greatest height of enthusiasm .

		But there is much significance in
Salvini	LOCATION	's further observa - tion : '' The Russian is courteous , hospitable , liberal to the actor ; but , like all those whose enthusiasm exceeds due bounds , he forgets eas - ily . ''

		No American who has once seen Tom - maso Salvini in '' Othello '' or '' Civile Morte '' can ever forget him .

		300 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Germanic criticism of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Arthur John Butler	PERSON	, favorably known for his edition -LRB- with English prose translation -RRB- of '' The Divine Comedy , '' now presents to English readers '' A Com - panion to Dante '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , translated from the German of
Herr G. A. Scartazzini	PERSON	.

		We say
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	, not merely because the author lives in a German commonwealth and writes in German as freely as in Italian , but also because his scholarship is distinctly of the German type , often pedantic and over-destructive in its criticism .

		It is surely a Ger - man who thus comments upon a certain theory of Father Gietmann : '' Being a German , however , he was too honorable to contest unconditionally the personal reality of Beatrice . ''

		Surely , also , it is a German who thus argues for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's lengthy stay in
Lucca	LOCATION	-LRB- an argument based upon Purg .

		xxiv .

		43 sqq . -RRB-

		: '' Further , if the city pleased him for a lady 's sake , he must have stayed for some time there ; for one does not in a couple of days fall in love with a lady , and , for her sake , with the place in which she lives . ''

		This '' Companion to Dante '' must not be confused with the ''
Manuale Dantesco	PERSON	'' of the same author .

		That work , published in
Milan	LOCATION	, was put into the hands of English readers some years ago by Mr.
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, with the title '' A Hand - book to Dante . ''

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's translation is of the '' Dante-Handbuch '' -LRB-
Leipzig	LOCATION	-RRB- of
1892	DATE	, which is
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	's revision of his own earlier '' Pro- legomeni della Divina Commedia . ''

		All serious stu - dents of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	must , of course , reckon with
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	, whom the death of
Witte	PERSON	left at the head of
Continental Dante	ORGANIZATION	scholarship .

		But few will be willing to accept all the results of his '' neg - ative dogmatism , '' however they may derive instruc - tion from his labors .

		With
Dante	PERSON	as with Homer , German criticism has discredited itself by its own excesses , and the best English scholarship is the safer guide in both cases .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	, who well represents this scholarship , gives us a number of notes corrective of the wilder vagaries of his author , besides sounding a prefatory note of warning .

		One monumental instance of
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	's method of pleading may be given .

		Quoting -LRB- V. N. 41 -RRB- the words , '' Where this most noble lady was born , lived , and died , '' the author tells us that '' to every unprejudiced mind '' this sentence implies that
Bea	PERSON	- trice `` had never left her parents ' house . ''

		But , un - fortunately for the theory , the antecedent to this phrase is '' the city , '' and nothing more is meant than that
Beatrice	PERSON	lived and died in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		So , in spite of
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	, many of us will cling to our old notions about
Dante	PERSON	, although reasoning akin to that just quoted may have persuaded our critic to reject them .

		We may even , perhaps , con - tinue to believe in the `` Letter to a Florentine Friend , '' although it is styled '' a rhetorical exercise of later date , which was innocently accepted as a letter of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's . ''

		But
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	's book is really useful as '' a companion to Dante , '' and those The new Troubadours .

		who read no German should be grateful for it .

		Its chapters are arranged in five groups , '' Dante in His Home , '' '' Dante in Exile , '' ''
Dante	PERSON	's Spiritual Life , '' ''
Dante	PERSON	's Smaller Works , '' and '' The Divina Com - media . ''

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	has taken the liberty of omit - ting the bibliographies , which was perhaps wise , and of condensing the final chapters , which was perhaps not so wise .

		^ r >
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	's '' An Em - bassy to
Provence	LOCATION	'' -LRB- The Century / - i \ it .

		i ii i _ i Co. -RRB- is the pleasantly whimsical rec - ord of a sentimental journey , mainly by carriage , from
Marseilles	LOCATION	to
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		The trip may be made by the rapide in two hours ; but the '' Em - bassy , '' true to diplomatic usage and tradition , man - aged to consume three months and four days on the journey .

		The object of the '' mission '' a visit to the
Avignon	LOCATION	nest of Provencal poets , the founders of the Felibridge brotherhood was hap - pily accomplished .

		Roumanille ,
Mistral	LOCATION	,
Mathieu	LOCATION	,
Gras	LOCATION	, leaders of the tuneful choir , were found in their charming homes ; there was much good-fellow - ship and cordiality , with the due admixture of '' Pro- vencal song and sunburnt mirth '' echoes of which linger pleasantly in Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's pages .

		Rouma - nille 's story of the beginning of his life-work is touching : '' He was but a lad of seventeen , a teacher in the school at
Tarascon	LOCATION	, when writing in French he first began to dabble in verse .

		One
Sunday	DATE	, when he was at home in Saint-Remy , his mother said to him , ` Why ,
Jduse	PERSON	, they tell me thou art making paper talk ! ' '

		Making paper talk , mother ? '

		` Yes , that is what they tell me .

		What is it thou art putting on the paper ?

		What dost thou make it say ? ' '

		But it is nothing , mother . ' '

		Oh , yes , my handsome
Jduse	PERSON	, it is something .

		Tell thy mother what it is . '

		But when he recited to her his French verses she shook her head sorrowfully , and sorrowfully said to him , ' I do not understand ! ' '

		And then , ' said
Roumanille	PERSON	, ' my heart rose up within me and cried , '' Write thy verses in the beau - tiful language that thy dear mother knows ! ''

		That very week I wrote my first poem in Provencal , '' Jeje '' ; and , being at home again the next
Sunday	DATE	, I recited it to her .

		When she wept , and kissed me , I knew that my verses had found their way to her heart ; and thenceforth I wrote only in Provencal . ' ''

		Such was the germ of the poetical brotherhood of the Felibridge now a great society with branches in various parts of
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The volume contains a portrait of Mistral , and Mr.
R. W. Gil	PERSON	- der has contributed a fine sonnet to `` The New Troubadours . ''

		Sir
W. Eraser	PERSON	's `` Hie et
Ubique	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is so various in matter and in manner as fairly to beggar description .

		The book is a unique medley of stories of eminent people , striking personal ex - periences , curiosities of literature , ingenious deriva - tions -LRB- too ingenious , mostly -RRB- , obiter dicta , and what not , the club-corner chat of a genial man of the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 world , who has seen much , read widely , and re - flected moderately .

		The author has a good deal to say , incidentally , about Shakespeare -LRB- he even peers cautiously into the Baconian mare 's - nest -RRB- , and among other questions he starts the following amus - ing one : '' Have the lovers of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ever asked or answered this question ?

		The stage direc - tion towards the end of that most beautiful scene between Hamlet and his father 's spirit is , ' Cock crows . '

		Can it be possible that at any period since the immortal
William	PERSON	's work was first produced an imitation of a cock crowing was given ?

		can there have been a time when it would not have produced a roar of laughter ?

		The very notion of a ' cock-a - doodle-doo ' coming immediately upon the pathetic utterances of the phantom is quite beyond my be - lief . ''

		This dubious '' stage direction '' gives rise to other reflections .

		Why , for instance , has it not served as a practical hint to enterprising managers ?

		Here is a chance for a bit of stage realism that would throw Mr.
Vincent Crummles	PERSON	's `` pump and tub scene '' hopelessly into the shade .

		The public , we are given to understand , wants '' veritism '' and does not care sixpence for the literary and artistic standards of an effete phase of culture .

		We have had real horses , real fire engines , real waterfalls in our plays , and real bores in our novels .

		Then why not the tragedy of '' Hamlet '' with a real crow from a real cock ?

		The public would be gratified , man - agerial coffers would be filled , and the behests of the immortal bard would be carried out . ''

		Hie et
Ubique	ORGANIZATION	'' is an altogether capital book to while away a
winter	DATE
evening	TIME	.

		Tales from Uniform in size and form with his
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, two series of last year '' Tales from Ten Poets '' and `` Tales from the Dramatists , '' Mr.
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	now issues the famous '' Tales from Shakespeare '' by
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	, with additions by himself to make them inclusive of the whole number of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Owing either to the personal taste of the Lambs , or to the wishes of the original publisher , or to some other practical consideration , only twenty of the Shakespearean plays were taken up by the `` Tales '' as already known to us , and these constitute Volumes I. and II .

		of the present edition .

		The remaining sixteen plays , which include the whole series of English histories and all the Ro - man plays , occupy Volumes III .

		and IV. , and until the present time have not been rendered into prose .

		They are some of the most difficult of adaptation to this plan of treatment , yet Mr.
Morris	PERSON	has been very successful , even though his work is brought into such close juxtaposition with that of the inim - itable '' Elia '' and his gifted sister .

		Each volume con - tains four illustrations ; these are particularly well - chosen , and are thus in marked contrast to some that disfigure the numerous cheap and ugly editions of this classic work which have been thrown on the market during the eighty-six years since
1807	DATE	, when the book was first published .

		The special episode in the city annals known as '' The
Chicago	LOCATION	Massacre of
1812	DATE	, '' already conspicuously treated in the larger work , has recently been made the subject of a spe - cial volume -LRB-
Dibble	PERSON	-RRB- , wherein it is narrated at greater length , and in the light of newly unearthed facts .

		The strictly new matter contained in this volume is based upon the recollections of Mr.
Da	PERSON	- rius
Heald	PERSON	, still living , the son of the
Captain Heald	ORGANIZATION	who commanded the white soldiers on the day of the massacre .

		Mr.
Heald	PERSON	has heard the story from his parents many times , and thus his evidence , al - though at second hand , is of great historical value .

		Mr.
Kirkland	PERSON	has gleaned , more carefully than any of his predecessors , the facts relating to the massa - cre , and the record as it stands in his book is prob - ably as complete as we can ever hope it to be .

		The style of the narrative is picturesque and vivid , as was to be expected of a successful novelist turned historian , and the numerous illustrations add mate - rially to the attractiveness of the work .

		Fifty years of good fishing .

		Lovers of the contemplative man 's recreation will find both technical lore and matter of entertainment in Major

England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, though he has practised the `` gentle art '' in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	and southern
Spain	LOCATION	, where he was quartered for a time with his regiment .

		The book is full of good humor and good stories , and the special chapter on `` The Fast Reel '' will be approved by amateurs .

		A book of `` Drolls . ''

		Mr.
J. H. Pearce	PERSON	's '' Drolls from Shadowland '' -LRB-
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- are not unlike his `` Pastels in Prose , '' at least in brevity .

		Mr.
Pearce	PERSON	's name is compara - tively new , though he may be remembered by many as the author of `` Inconsequent Lives . ''

		Some of his crystals of thought on occult problems come dangerously near the uncanny . ''

		The man who coined his blood into gold , '' '' The man who could 302 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Crisp and '' Frenchy , '' Poesque and poetical , artful and artis - tic , are these strays from shadowland , and we may safely commend them as an antidote against som - nolency .

		For so weird a book , a cover design by Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	had been in keeping ; but it is pretty as it is , with its light-blue ribbed cloth , etched frontispiece , and rubricated title .

		The other volumes now issued are ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' '' Cape Cod , '' and '' The

		Each volume has a prefatory bibliographical note and a separate index .

		The green cloth covers of this edition , as well as the other mechanical features , are in the good taste that the publishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have led us to expect .

		THE uniform and neatly gotten-np edition of Mr.

		However Mr.

		MESSRS.
Scribner	PERSON	have just published a new edition , in four volumes , with many portraits , of '' The Auto - biography and Recollections of
Laura	LOCATION	, Duchess of Abrantes . ''

		The work has been scarce for some years , and the text has been carefully revised for the new edi - tion .

		The world does not seem willing to forget the Napoleonic story , and this history of the inner life of

		OUR Great West '' is a volume made up of maga - zine articles by Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is de - scribed as '' a study of the present conditions and future possibilities of the new commonwealths and capitals of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		It is of the civilized West that Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	has written , and his book makes little men - tion of Indians , or of cowboys , or of wild game .

		In - stead , he gives us the politics , the society , and the com - mercial development of such cities as
Chicago	LOCATION	and
San Francisco	LOCATION	, such states as
Colorado	LOCATION	and the
Dakotas	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	's descriptions are superficial , but picturesque and sensible .

		Too late for use as a guide , but not too late to have a certain value for purposes of reference , we have a little pamphlet upon '' The Publishers ' and Other Book Exhibits at the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, '' made up of articles that have been appearing from time to time in `` The Publishers ' Weekly . ''

		Whoever is re - sponsible for these articles has made a careful search for the book exhibits in the Exposition , and has un - earthed some of them from out-of-the-way corners .

		He seems to have missed one or two small exhibits of Scandinavian books , but with this exception the record is complete , and gives us intelligent criticism , from the manufacturing and trade standpoints , of the collections displayed . ''

		THE Tenant of Wildfell Hall , '' in two volumes , com - pletes the tasteful Dent edition of the

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Nov. 9 , 1893	DATE	.

		I learn that Prof.
Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen	PERSON	spent
last summer	DATE	at '' The Moorlands , '' his beautiful new home at
Southampton	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, engaged in putting the fin - ishing touches to '' A Commentary on the Writings of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, '' on which he has been at work during spare moments for several years , and which I am at liberty to announce .

		Prof.
Boyesen	PERSON	's long personal ac - quaintance with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as well as his remarkable lin - guistic abilities , particularly adapt him to be the Nor - wegian 's interpreter .

		Most of the English reviews of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's work and philosophy have been clearly wide of the mark , while but little criticism worthy of the name has as yet appeared in this country .

		Prof.
Boyesen	PERSON	's book will be published here and in
England	LOCATION	, by the
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	, some time in
January	DATE	or
February	DATE	.

		The opening chapters will deal with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's early or histor - ical plays as a whole , the later or philosophical plays receiving a chapter each .

		Ibsen 's poems will also re - ceive separate attention .

		The translations of the poems which Prof.
Boyesen	PERSON	has made preserve the metre and the rhyme of the originals , as in the case of
Taylor	PERSON	's '' Faust . ''

		He has also translated directly many pas - sages from the dramas illustrative of the philosophical propositions considered existing translations not be - ing very available in this respect .

		Altogether , stu - dents of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's writings are likely to find this '' Com - mentary '' a valuable assistance in their investigations , while it will be of interest to the general reader as an interpreter of the text .

		The articles on
Ibsen which Prof. Boyesen	ORGANIZATION	has contributed to THE DIAL will reap - pear in this volume .

		Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, the young Canadian novelist who has come into notice so rapidly during the past year , has returned to
America	LOCATION	from
London	LOCATION	, in order to ar - range for the serial publication of his new novel , '' The Trespasser , '' and to obtain a little rest after a year of very hard work .

		He is planning trips to
Canada	LOCATION	and to
Mexico	LOCATION	, and will probably spend a month or two in
New York	LOCATION	before leaving for
England	LOCATION	.

		In spite of the professed object of his visit he is already working out the scheme of his next romance , which will deal with
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 ante-Revolutionary times , and will introduce
George Washington	PERSON	as a British officer in the French and In - dian wars .

		The editors of ''
Harper	PERSON	's , '' '' Scribner 's , '' and the '' Cen - tury '' magazines have made extraordinary efforts in the direction of brilliant Christmas numbers this year .

		A glance at the advanced sheets of all three publications shows almost unparalleled excellence in the engravings and reproductions , to say nothing of the lists of distin - guished contributors .

		Particularly notable are Mr.
T. Cole	PERSON	's engravings after
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, the first in the series of old Dutch masters to appear in the '' Century . ''

		The expression of color values by plain black and white is quite marvellous .

		In '' Scribner 's , '' Mr.
Allan Mar	PERSON	- quand 's account of his search for della Robbias in
Italy	LOCATION	is illustrated by half-tone reproductions in tint , which render the values of the old paintings in almost as re - markable a way .

		It is very clear , however , that , al - though process-work is rapidly approaching perfection , we shall not be able to dispense with the wood-engraver yet awhile .

		Another notable instance of artistic process-work is shown in the illustrations of Mr.
Charles A. Platt	PERSON	's forthcoming book , '' Italian Gardens . ''

		It has only been necessary for the artist-author to select the point of view in each case , the camera , the process man and the printer supplementing his work with their own .

		The book itself is a thorough exposition of that formal style of landscape architecture which came into existence during the Renaissance , and it will be found very help - ful by our constantly increasing class of villa-dwellers in
summer	DATE	resorts and the suburbs of great cities .

		Mention of Mr.
Platt	PERSON	's book reminds one of the great number of artists who have recently commenced work as authors also .

		It is no longer possible to count them on the fingers of both hands .

		The series of '' American Artists ' Adventures '' and of '' Artists ' Impressions at the Fair , '' now running in two of the magazines , are de - veloping literary talent in several unsuspected quarters .

		The artists , too , have a great advantage over their lit - erary brethren , for they illustrate their own articles , and hence the illustrations are always satisfactory .

		The second of the two series just mentioned will shortly be published in book form by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons as '' Some Artists at the Fair . ''

		I am informed by the firm that each of the artist-authors approaches the subject from a different point of view , and gives his im - pressions , both of the human spectacle and of the aes - thetic aspects of the Fair , with characteristic candor and individuality .

		.

		World 's Fair books multiply apace .

		Some of them have been written and printed with surprising rapidity .

		Mr.
Ellsworth	PERSON	and Mr.
Tudor Jenks	PERSON	, of the
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	, were delegated to prepare this firm 's `` World 's Fair Book '' for children as late as the last week in
September	DATE	.

		Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	had completed his manuscript by
October 10	DATE	, and the last form , illustra - tions and all , was on the press two weeks later .

		The death of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	is announced as I write , and I am reminded of several pleasant interviews with the historian at
New Castle	LOCATION	,
Portsmouth Harbor	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, where his daughter and artist son-in - law , Mr. and Mrs.
J. Templeman Coolidge	PERSON	, have their
summer	DATE	home in the old
Wentworth	LOCATION	mansion .

		Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	passed a number of summers at
New Castle	LOCATION	, and seemed to take much pleasure in the quiet life of the place .

		Until his health gave way entirely he could often be seen rowing about the creeks and inlets , or sailing in Mr.
Coolidge	PERSON	's wherry , with its red-colored lateen sail .

		Another of the New Castle literary colony , Mr.
John Albee	PERSON	, has just come to
New York	LOCATION	for a month 's visit .

		Mr.
Albee	PERSON	was the pioneer of the col - ony , so to speak , having purchased the Governor
Jaffrey	PERSON	cottage and farm nearly twenty-five years ago .

		I no - ticed last
summer	DATE	that he had newly decorated the old dining-room , and , looking closely , observed that the border of the wall-paper was composed of a row of stereotyped plates extending clear around the room .

		On inquiring the reason of this strange decoration , Mr.
Albee	PERSON	informed me that these were the plates of his first book , and that this was his method of getting peo - ple to read it .

		All this is changed now , however , for I learned some time ago from Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mif	LOCATION	- flin
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	that Mr.
Albee	PERSON	's '' Prose Idyls , '' published by them last year , has gone into a third or fourth edi - tion .

		Among books not yet announced is a new volume of travels by Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	, entitled '' The
Barbary Coast	ORGANIZATION	, '' to be published this season by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr. Field 's warm-hearted individuality always finds its way into his volumes , and has created for him an in - creasing class of readers who look for his successive books with deep interest .

		The library of two hundred best or most popular books which Messrs.
J. Selwiu Tait	PERSON	& Sons have been so long preparing will soon begin to appear .

		It will be remembered that one hundred and fifty of them are works of fiction , chosen by a comparison of lists of most popular novels supplied by libraries throughout the country .

		The other fifty volumes have been selected from general literature .

		Messrs.
Tait	PERSON	& Sons have kept fifty of the young artists of the Art Students ' League employed in preparing illustrations for these books for over six months .

		An article concerning this series and the librarians ' reports will be published in the next num - ber of the '' Forum . ''

		Mr.
Willis O. Chapin	PERSON	, author of '' Masters and Mas - terpieces of Engraving , '' one of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' most important books of the season , resides at
Buffalo	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, and is a lawyer by profession .

		He has made a deep study of the history and theory of the engraver 's art , and is an acknowledged authority on the subject .

		Mr.
William J. Linton	PERSON	and Mr.
Frederick Keppel	PERSON	have aided him with their advice and assistance .

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY XOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		The
New York Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	will begin , on
January 1 , 1894	DATE	, the publication of '' The Bankside Quarterly , '' a quarterly magazine devoted to Shake - speariana and the
Contemporary Drama	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editorial conduct will be assumed by members of the society , and the magazine will be published by the
Shakespeare Press	ORGANIZATION	, a new printing concern , incorporated under the laws of the state of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, but doing business in the city of
New York	LOCATION	, for the purpose of printing edi - tions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and books of Shakespearian and dramatic literature .

		The '' Anthropological Series , '' to be edited by Pro- fessor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, is announced by Messrs.
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton .

		The books in this series will treat of ethnology , prehistoric archseology , ethnography , etc. , and the pur - pose is to make anthropology better known to intelli - 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, gent readers who are not specialists and have no desire to be , although the series will be one which no special student can afford to ignore .

		While these books will be of general interest , they will be written by authori - ties , and scientific accuracy will not be sacrificed to pop - ularity .

		The first book in this series will be '' Woman 's Place in Primitive Culture , '' by Professor
O. R. Mason	PERSON	of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution .

		The meeting of
the Association Litte	ORGANIZATION	` raire et Artis - tique Internationale , held at
Barcelona	LOCATION	during the clos - ing days of
September	DATE	, was reported for the
New York	LOCATION	'' Nation '' by the only American present .

		The writer signs only his initials , but we assume them to stand for the name of Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	.

		His account of the conference , which was mainly devoted to copyright , is very interesting , particularly from the fact that the del - egates seemed to favor the eventual establishment of perpetual rights in intellectual property .

		As a tempo - rary measure , the uniform term of one hundred years from publication was recommended .


Spain	LOCATION	already does about as much as this possibly more , her term being eighty years beyond the life of the author .

		A FRAGMENT FROM AUSTIN
DOBSON	PERSON	.

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' recently printed an anni - versary note on Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	and his library , written , we understand , by Mr.
Henri	PERSON	Pe ` ne '
Du Bois	PERSON	, who tells a pretty story about Mr.
Austin Dob	PERSON	- son 's '' Vignettes in Rhyme , '' a book that was edited by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	for the American publishers , and reviewed in THE DIAL in its earliest number -LRB-
May	DATE	, 1880 -RRB- . ''

		In his dedication of the book to
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, '' says Mr.
Du Bois	PERSON	, ''
Austin Dobson	PERSON	had written the phrase , ' made me very pleased and proud . '


Stedman	PERSON	, objecting to the use of ' very ' before a participle , changed the phrase to ' made me proud and very happy . '

		-LSB- Mr.
Du Bois	PERSON	is in error here , as the exact wording in the dedication is ` made me very proud and happy . ' -RSB-

		He advised
Dobson	PERSON	, and received from him the follow - ing neat reply : '' Dear S : The error is allowed : ' T is clear I can ' t be ' pleased ' and ' proud ' ; So , if it give your scruples ease , Let me be ' proud ' and what you please .

		Indeed , I 'm rather glad I said it ; It shows how carefully you edit , And if I break the head of Priscian , I hope you '11 always be physician , Since you so cleverly can cut A plaster for his occiput Making it plain how close you follow , In all his attributes , Apollo , Who , with a musical degree ,
Like Holmes	PERSON	, was also an M.D. ! ''

		THE WAGNER CULT IN
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		The Parisians having been at last induced to take their
Wagner	PERSON	, the manner of their taking him becomes of interest , especially as it reproduces certain phases of the Wagner-Kampf in
Germany	LOCATION	a generation ago .

		The following notes are from the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' : '' If
Wagner	PERSON	could have lived as long as
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	, he would have been surprised to find that in
1893	DATE	the chief seat of the
Wagner	PERSON	cult would be , not at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	or
Munich	LOCATION	, but at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		There the '
Walkiire	PERSON	' has in a few months reached its fortieth performance , and the repertoire of the Grand Opera reads week after week , ` Valkyrie , ' relache , ` Lohengrin , ' ` Lohengrin , ' relache , ' Valkyrie . '

		Parodies of these operas are now in order .

		Many years ago Suppd wrote the music to a '
Lohen	PERSON	- gelb , ' but the Parisians are to have a parody of their own this winter , entitled ' The Little Lohengrin . '

		A parody of the '
Valkyrie	ORGANIZATION	' has already appeared in a
Boulevard	LOCATION	theatre .

		Its name is an atrocious pun on ` La Valkyrie ' ' La V'lakyrit ' -LRB- la voila qui rit -RRB- .

		As a specimen of the fun , the sword scene may be men - tioned .

		Siegmund soliloquizes and wonders where Wo - tan has put the sword : Ou diable Va-t-il cache ?

		At that moment he sees the glowing hilt in the tree , and exclaims , ' Tiens , Us ont V electricite ! '

		Sieglinde taunts him : ' Have you any muscle ? '

		Whereupon he spits in his hands and pulls out the sword . ''

		THE VERSATILE AND INSATIATE
MR. LANG	PERSON	.

		An English writer thus rhymingly bewails Mr. An - drew
Lang	PERSON	's annexation of a large proportion of the attractive literary territories : '' Lang-syne I loved a ' Fairy Book ' That since I 've seldom seen ,
Unprefaced	LOCATION	, of a homely look , And clad in sober green .

		Now every ' myth ' that e'er was bred In
Europe	LOCATION	or Penang Is ' edited ' in blue or red -LRB- Of course -RRB- by A w L g I ' Sir
Walter	PERSON	's ' novels never pall For strange editions new The public tireless seems to call : I turn the cover Phew !

		What , can ' t we buy our Northern Mage -LRB- Let scholiasts go hang ! -RRB-

		Without , upon his title-page .

		The name of A w L g ?

		Adown the envenomed ' I > ly N ws ' Each morn I joy to note How lettered culture doth infuse A soothing antidote .

		And stumbling on some well-worn tag Of academic slang Ah !

		do n't I know the learned wag , My blithesome A w L g !

		I 've often wished this critic sound Would make a slight faux pas , Some frantic theory propound , And fall a prey Aha !

		To Censure 's fang : -LRB- This rhyming phrase I kindly throw away -RRB- Confound the man !

		he always says Just what I want to say .

		I '11 straight take ' ship ' for foreign shore -LRB- But for that hateful ' sign ! ' -RRB-

		.

		And ne'er of sage or classic more I '11 read another line .

		No matter what he says or sings I close it with a bang , For over every mortal thing 's The spoor of A w L g ! ''

		NEWLY-PRINTED LETTERS OF
MRS. BROWNING	PERSON	.

		`` The Bookman '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , in its issue for
October , 1893	DATE	, contains selections from the catalogues of auto - graph sales during 1892-3 ; and among other interest - ing items are extracts from two letters written by Eliz - abeth
Barrett Browning	PERSON	to
R. H. Home	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of these is dated
January 30 , 1844	DATE	, and is as follows : . ''

		I think from a far remembrance that Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	's first poem was called ' The Undying One . '

		Her chief poem , that is , the principal one in her last volume , is ' The Dream . '

		Have you read these ?

		to be of opinion still , as said the ' Quarterly , ' that she is a modification of Byron ?

		The only poems which could have suggested such a likeness are the personal ones , I fancy , and they ,
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 with some intensity and much pathos , are very unlike
Byron	PERSON	.

		Do you , too , call
Byron	PERSON	vindictive ?

		I do not .

		If he turned upon the dark , it was by the instinct of passion , not by the theory of Vengeance , I believe and am assured .

		Poor , poor Lord
Byron !	PERSON

		How would I lay the Sun and
Moon	PERSON	against a tennis-ball that he had more tenderness in one section of his heart than Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	has in all her 's though a tenderness misunder - stood and crushed , ignorantly , profanely , and solely by false friends and a pattern wife .

		His blood is on our heads , on us in
England	LOCATION	even as
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's is .

		Two stains of the sort have we in
one century	DATE	and what will wash them out ? ''

		The second letter is dated
Feb. 20 , 1844	DATE	, and with reference to the influence on the mind of
Charles Dick	PERSON	- ens of the French School of imaginative literature , says : '' Since I went through the romances of the gifted Frenchman -LRB-
Victor Hugo	PERSON	-RRB- my admiration for our coun - tryman has paled down , paler and paler . ''

		And again : ''
George Sand	PERSON	is the greatest female genius the world ever saw at least since it saw
Sappho	PERSON	, who broke off a fragment of her soul to be guessed by as creation did by its fossils . ''

		NEW USES OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY .

		Mr.
Edwin H. Woodruff	PERSON	, Librarian of the
Leland Stanford	PERSON	,
Junior	ORGANIZATION	,
University	ORGANIZATION	, has printed his address , given before the Librarians '
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
last July	DATE	, upon '' Some Present Tendencies in University Libraries . ''

		The following paragraphs are among the most signifi - cant : '' The administration of the university library has been compelled , and will be compelled still further , to adapt itself to the new methods of university work .

		In beginning the study of some special topic , professor and student wish to make their own preliminary bibliog - raphy , and then , and afterwards , carry on their investi - gation by moving from foot-note to foot-note , from ref - erence to reference , from allusion to allusion , and from one bibliographical aid to another .

		It is , therefore , im - portant that the freest possible access to the books them - selves should be had - that is , ideally , the freedom of access of a scholar to his private library , access that is regulated by such care as -LRB- to express it in the lan - guage of the law -RRB- an ordinarily prudent student would exercise in his own library of equal value .

		It is not un - likely that the university librarian will be forced to take an entirely new point of view , namely , that the collec - tion is to be considered as the private working library of the university student , even of the freshman . ''

		Perhaps most of the administrative changes pro- posed to meet these new conditions will find the library authorities objecting with an ` impossible ' ; but if the new method is the correct one , then the modifications must be made in one way or another , for the whole internal polity of a university can not be made to con - form to the old library regulations .

		In these days of the extension of the elective franchise it will not do to say that a man is to be deprived of his vote because he is not fit to vote .

		The way to make him fit is not by perpetuating the restriction , but by giving him the right to vote .

		It is not too much to hope that , even in the largest university libraries , all students before very long may be accorded the freest access to all books in the department in which they are working . ''

		Access to the shelves requires that the shelf nota - tion , whatever else it may be , should be the simplest possible .

		As men do not ordinarily think in decimals , an effort should be made to avoid decimals ; as the tem - per of the investigator should be calm , it must not be ruffled by too strange a mingling of symbolical letters and figures .

		As to classification : One can not fail to admire the genius of the creators of all the elaborate schemes for the amelioration of shelf arrangements .

		But one must sometimes feel perplexed to choose among them , and will echo the exclamation of the Scotch peas - ant to his companion when , with awe , they looked for the first time over the prospect from the top of Ben Lomond : ' Ah , Mon Jock , but arna the warks o ' the Lard deevil - ish ! '

		However , each kind of library must adopt that classification which suits it best .

		Our modern univer - sity library is a workshop , and , as in any other work - shop , the tools must be arranged subordinate to the con - venience of the worker .

		The professor and student move along , not so much from one class of books to an - other as from one author reference to another . ''

		353 THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF THE UNITED STA TES .

		The corner stone of the building which is to be the permanent home of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has just been laid , with the ceremonies usual upon such occasions , and the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	has just transferred its collections to the magnificent structure that has been in process of erection for two years past .

		These occurrences , which mean so much for the intellectual future of
Chicago	LOCATION	, make a few remarks upon the libraries of the
United States	LOCATION	peculiarly appro - priate at the present time .

		As a basis for such remarks , there comes to us , at the same time , a `` Circular of Information '' from the
National Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, giving the most reef nt statistics upon the subject of our public libra - ries .

		The statistics are for the year
1891	DATE	, which is as nearly up to date as could be ex - pected of a report prepared by the deliberate methods of our official collectors of such ma - terials .

		The present report is the third of the sort that has been issued by the
Bureau of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , the two preceding ones having appeared in
1876	DATE	and
1885	DATE	, respectively .

		The report 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, of
1876	DATE	included 3,649 libraries of over 300 volumes , with an aggregate of 12,276,964 vol - umes .

		The report of
1885	DATE	included 5,388 libraries above the same low limit of size , with an aggregate of 20,622,076 volumes .

		In the present report , all libraries of less than 1,000 volumes have been ignored , and those above this limit number 3,804 , with an aggregate of 26,896,537 volumes .

		While these figures are doubtless sufficiently trustworthy to be used as a basis for general conclusions , our confidence in their entire accuracy is considerably impaired by the fact that careless compilation , or care - less proof-reading , has resulted in discrepancies which , to say the least , should never have been permitted in a government publication .

		Thus , Mr.
Flint	PERSON	, the statistician who has compiled the report , gives us 3,649 libraries for
1876	DATE	and 5,388 for
1885	DATE	.

		But Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, who prefaces the report with a '' letter of trans - mittal '' to the Secretary of the Interior , gives the numbers 3,647 and 5,338 for those years .

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	himself gives the number for
1891	DATE	in one place as 3,804 and in another as 3,803 .

		Again , his report of the aggregate number of volumes in
1891	DATE	gives us , in one place , the figures above quoted , and , in another place , figures differing from these by no less than 70,000 .

		It appears that Mr.
Flint	PERSON	has neg - lected the very important duty of '' proving '' his results , unless the cause of his undoing is to be found in his failure to correct the proofs .

		The general outcome of this report is cer - tainly very gratifying .

		Taking the figures ab - solutely , it is interesting to learn that there are half as many books in public libraries as there are people in the
United States	LOCATION	, that the average size of the nearly four thousand libra - ries is nearly eight thousand volumes , and that such a collection of books is , on an average , within reach of every sixteen thousand men , women , and children .

		Making a comparison between the figures for
1891	DATE	and those for
1885	DATE	, we find in six years an increase of twenty - seven per cent in the number of libraries con - taining over a thousand volumes , and an in - crease of sixty-six per cent in their contents .

		When we consider also the great increase of private book-buying during recent years , it will be realized that our reading public is grow - ing very rapidly , and that it is by no means dependent , as is so often assumed , upon the newspapers for its intellectual sustenance .

		An examination of the statistics which re - port the size of our public libraries yields some interesting results , and also illustrates afresh the unpardonable carelessness of this report .

		The four largest libraries are the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	- ional , the
Boston	LOCATION	Public , the
Harvard Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , and
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	collections .

		The first three of these are reported as con - taining more than half a million volumes each , which is true only of the first two .

		The Har - vard Library is only brought into this class by counting its nearly three hundred thousand pamphlets .

		But in the report of the aggre - gate number of volumes contained in all our libraries , no pamphlets are counted .

		It is evi - dent that , if this principle is once adopted , it should be applied consistently in all the classi - fications which follow .

		The second group of libraries includes those having from one hun - dred thousand to three hundred thousand vol - umes , and in this class twenty-six are reported .

		Of these , seven are assigned to the State of
New York	LOCATION	, headed by the
Astor	PERSON	and the Mer - cantile -LRB- less than a thousand volumes apart , and numbering nearly a quarter of a million each -RRB- ; four to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	; three each to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, and the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	; two to
Illinois	LOCATION	; and one each to
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		But an examination of the detailed reports of the libraries in question reveal the fact that pamphlets must be counted in the case of five of these collections , to make up the mini - mum number of one hundred thousand vol - umes ; and that , in three instances , the pam - phlets are to the volumes nearly in the ratio of three to one .

		The geographical distribution of our libra - ries is a matter of considerable interest , and the report is very instructive upon this sub - ject .

		The
New England	LOCATION	and
Middle States	LOCATION	have more than half of the entire number ,
New York	LOCATION	heading the list with 511 , and
Massachu	PERSON	- setts closely following with 508 .


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has 350 , and
Illinois	LOCATION	-LRB- thanks to a liberal stat - ute -RRB- has 218 .

		Ohio ,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Missouri	LOCATION	come next , in the order named .

		No other state has as many as a hundred , and ten states and terri - tories , mostly in the West , have less than ten libraries each .

		But none , not even Indian Ter - ritory , has less than three .

		And the library facilities of the West and South are increasing at a satisfactory rate .

		A few Canadian statistics are included in the present work .

		Over two hundred libraries are reported , three-fourths of them in the Province of
Ontario	LOCATION	, and the aggregate number of vol -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 umes is 1,392,366 .

		The Library of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment at
Ottawa	LOCATION	heads the list with 150,000 volumes , and that of
Laval University	ORGANIZATION	, with 100,000 , comes next .


Toronto	LOCATION	is fairly well supplied with books , and
Montreal	LOCATION	not so well .

		A large proportion of the Canadian libraries belong to Mechanics ' Institutes .

		It would be interesting , had we space for the purpose , to compile from this document the special statistics of school and college libraries , which would be found to contain a large frac - tion of the total number of books reported .

		Two of the four largest libraries belong to edu - cational institutions , as do also five of the twenty-six constituting the second group .

		It is probable that the college or school library is of more ultimate value to the community than the library of any other sort .

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, in his introduction to the report that we have just had under consideration , gives us some very sensible words on the usefulness of the school library .

		We wish that he had not coupled them with certain high-sounding ob - servations upon the newspaper as an educa - tional agency of coordinate rank .

		With the person who reads the newspapers , we are told , '' the correlation of the near and the remote , the custom of carrying in his mind the world affairs , develops a sort of epic consciousness vastly more educative than the former village gossip that prevailed in the tavern or in the shop .

		It elevates the individual into a higher plane of thinking , substituting the universal for the particular . ''

		We very much doubt its doing anything of the sort , although it might accomplish such a purpose if the daily , newspapers were what they ought to be .

		But that is another story .

		We can not refrain , in conclusion , from ex - pressing a wish that the publications of our national government might be made a little more attractive in appearance than they are .

		Intellectual work of an excellent sort often goes to their preparation -LRB- as , with some reser - vations , in the present instance -RRB- , but they are , mechanically , about as bad as it is possible for printed books to be .

		Government printing , like government architecture and a few other things bearing the official tag , has stood here - tofore for work of the cheapest and most taste - less sort .

		Sometime we shall take a lesson in this matter from , say , the French government ; this is one of the good things that may be hoped for when work for the public ceases to be regarded as a reward for services done to some political party .

		AN INSULAR COMMENT ON AN INTER - NATIONAL ENTERPRISE .

		When the British press starts out to display its provincialism , it easily outdistances the most zealous French or German competitors , and no one would deny its claim to the attribute of insularity in all the senses of that term .

		A beautiful illustration of this attribute , which Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	so well knew how to satirize , is offered by the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' in a recent account of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		The article begins with the following paragraph : '' The
Chicago Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	has quietly come to an end , the tragic death of the Mayor of the city forming one sufficient reason for dispensing with closing ceremonies .

		Another may have been a general recognition by the Chicagoans that their show had to some extent fizzled . ''

		After this cheerful exordium , we have some re - flections upon the incompleteness of the Fair during its earlier weeks , and a few strictures , not altogether unjustified , upon the conduct of the directors in the matters of
Sunday	DATE	closing and the official system of awards .

		The article then goes on as follows : '' The World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	had no proper claims on the world 's attention , and has therefore , very rightly , not been able to enforce any .

		It was a colossal show , and a fair number of people something under a million a week attended it , of whom a large portion went over and over again , the noughts on the millions being chiefly run up by the local crowds .

		But there was no reason why the whole world should attend , and it distinctly failed to do so .

		Dwellers in civilized places appear to have thought that they could see as much of the material side of the Exhibition as they desired in their domestic shop-windows .

		The great thinkers of the world paid no attention to the invitations of the
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	, a queerly named offshoot from the parent scheme , which begged them to attend in the Art Institute of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and supplement the material exhi - bition by ' a portrayal of the achievements of the age in science , literature , education , government , morals , charity , religion , and other departments of human activ - ity -LRB- ! -RRB- '

		The landscape gardens of
Jackson Park	LOCATION	were chiefly thronged by American sight-seers , and the ses - sions of the
Auxiliary Congress	ORGANIZATION	were , with but one exception , largely left to the self-advertising idiot and the blue-stocking woman .

		And the exception owed its partial success to the enthusiasm of an English man of letters . ''

		This is so delicious that it is not difficult to take good-humoredly some of the sallower things that follow the characterization of the `` Exhibition '' as '' a local show , '' and of the citizens by whom its cost has been `` amiably borne '' as `` the ignorant millionaire , the grain-man , the pig-man , the anar - chist , the Irish politician , and the dude who has bust -LSB- sic -RSB- and gone West , '' etc. , etc. .

		Of the
White City	ORGANIZATION	itself which we now learn was called `` the
Elfin City	LOCATION	, the
City of White Palaces	ORGANIZATION	, the
Western Venice	LOCATION	, the Fairy -LRB- or preferably Faerie -RRB- City , the Dream City -LRB- for further variants see the
Chicago	LOCATION	press -RRB- , '' we are patronizingly informed that `` the conventionally classical buildings had the good taste of their examples . ''

		The most preposterous fea - 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ture of the Exposition , from a British standpoint , seems to be the notion that the people who attended it were likely to derive any benefit therefrom .

		The idea cherished by its promoters the pig-man , ignor - ant millionaire , `` bust '' dude , and anarchist that it might `` furnish an object-lesson in civilization , '' is thus borne down upon by this pot-casqued crusader : `` In the thirteen great halls , stuffed with the produce of the world , there was much to be learned by every - body possessing the necessary curiosity and energy .

		Fishing-tackle and lime-juice preparations , electric plant and bulbs from
Holland	LOCATION	, crime statistics and furniture from
Tottenham Court Road	ORGANIZATION	, canned goods and one thousand and seventy-five paintings by American artists , were all on view .

		But whether these things had a message for the intellectually starving of the West is very doubtful , and certainly such message was made no more distinct by the reiterated assertions of the press that they could understand it . ''

		Intelligent Americans , who are quite used to seeing in ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' articles on American affairs an exhibition of
John Bull	PERSON	at his worst , will of course find all this amusing enough .

		But we should hardly suppose it could prove amusing to intelligent and manly Englishmen .

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, for example , who has seen the Exposition for himself , and has lately made an impassioned appeal for greater cordiality between the two coun - tries , must find it pretty discouraging .

		THE TARIFF ON BOOKS .

		The publication of the Tariff Bill drafted by the
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	comes too close to the issue of this number of THE DIAL to permit of our commenting upon it at any length , but we can not refrain from an expression of amazement at the retention of the old duty upon English books published within twenty years from the date of importation .

		It is not within our province to discuss the general features of this , or of any , Tariff Bill ; but it is our duty , as it is the duty of every journal interested in education and the advancement of culture , to protest against any embodiment , in our forthcoming tariff legisla - tion , of a tax upon knowledge , whether for the purpose of protection or of revenue .

		We had every reason to hope and believe that such survivals of barbarism as taxes upon the means of culture would be eliminated from our statute-book in the scientific revision of the tariff to which the party now in power is pledged .

		But Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's committee has seen fit , it now appears , to recommend for con - tinuance the twenty-five per cent duty upon English books .

		A more stupid duty could not be imagined ; as a means of raising revenue , it is despicable ; as a means of protection it is absolutely futile .

		It simply puts a needless difficulty in the way of stu - dents who wish to purchase such English books as are not copyrighted in this country .

		The books that are thus copyrighted are already protected by the copyright law itself .

		We hope that every scholar , every educator , and every person having intellectual interests of any sort , will join in a de - mand for the free admission of English books , as a feature of our new Tariff Law .

		Every such per - son should make an individual appeal to the Repre - sentative from his Congressional District ; unless some such concerted action is taken , we shall find that wool , and iron , and tin will absorb the atten - tion of the public to the exclusion of this very important matter .

		CONSUELO .

		I list to Consuelo as she sweeps With passionate touch the ivory organ-keys ; Deep in the infinite her spirit sees Themes that the soul of lofty heaven keeps ; Long-lineaged hope that to the zenith leaps , The joy of time , the secret key of woe , The passion ruling till its potence steeps The conquered Universe within its glow .

		O Consuelo !

		in thy music high , Thy vaguenesses , thy raptured spirit ear , Why not some echo of an earthly cry The soft , sweet sounds that men are used to hear ?

		Cease to consort with what , like yonder star , Gleams unattained a splendor from afar .

		ii .

		Silent the keys , and Consuelo speaks : '' O poor diviner of the inmost heart , Thou hast no knowledge of the higher art , Nor feel ` st the ecstasy that in me leaps ; Thou liest fain amid the silent steeps Where Araby her barren mounts displays , And o'er thy spirit with insistence creeps The dull delusion of our later days .

		The earth is wide , and wider than the earth Is Heaven rearing to the central sky ; Think of beginning , think of death and birth , And of life 's seeds that fusing long must lie .

		Sordid is care , and wealth of little worth , But the unseen can never dim nor die . ''


W. R. PERKINS	PERSON	.

		A CORRESPONDENT of the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenseuin '' has sent to that journal the following sonnet by
Wordsworth	PERSON	, which appeared originally in '' The Morning Post '' of
October 10 , 1803	DATE	, and is believed to have been since unprinted . ''

		I find it written of Simonides That travelling in strange countries once he found A corpse that lay expiring on the ground , For which , with pain , he caused due obsequies To be performed , and paid all holy fees .

		Soon after , this man 's ghost unto him came And told him not to sail , as was his aim , On board a ship then ready for the seas .

		Simonides , admonished by the ghost , Remained behind ; the ship the following day Set sail , was wrecked , and all on board was lost .

		Thus was the tenderest Poet that could be , Who sang in ancient Grece his loving lay , Saved out of many by his piety . ''

		CREATIVE ART IN LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, in his very interesting articles in your columns , complains that '' our poets are more in love with poetry than with things . ''

		That may be be - cause they have nothing to say ; and if one has nothing to say , it is at least better that he should say it well than say it ill .

		In any case , if one can not reach the best results by explicitly and of set purpose following art-methods , neither will he by explicitly and of set purpose ignoring these .

		Stated in the barest form , the requisites of literary art are , or would seem to be , first , that the artist have some - thing to say ; and , second , that he say it well .

		Art in - cludes both of these , and in so far as one or other is lacking , thus far is the artist 's power curtailed and his art defective .

		But while vast numbers aspire to art in literature , few aspirants combine both requisites ; and the rarity of this combination , which is one of nature 's own making , has in the past as well as in our own day driven many into one or other of two extremes either to neglect form and finish , or to neglect idea and ethic .

		As regards the latter , there is in every art a technical element , and in literature , as in music and painting , there are those who mistake this technical element for the entire art .

		These commonly sing elegant trifles , because nature has given them nothing more serious or strong or valuable to utter ; and while they sing grace - fully , they are emphasizing one essential of true art in literature .

		In actual criticism , the above distinction takes one a very little way .

		Still , it is important to emphasize the second aspect of production , especially where we are so prone to haste ; and though Poe had done nothing else , he deserves to be perpetually remembered for hav - ing insisted as he did upon the necessity of studying even the mechanical processes of creative art .

		These processes , however , are less merely mechanical than he suggested , for the artistic instinct is a part of '' great creating nature , '' and its processes are a reflex of those that we see operating towards perfection of form and finish of detail throughout the material universe .

		The art to which they belong is an '' art which nature makes . ''

		In addition to this , we must remember that art , in whatever sphere , implies not merely an objective result , but also a subjective process of mind ; and in this sub - jective creative process form and substance are so inter - blended that no absolute separation is possible .

		The embodied result , whether it be poem , picture , sympho - ny , or cathedral , will address itself to the intellectual perception of form , unity , and completeness ; but its ap - peal will be charged with the emotional and ethical quality of the artist 's own soul .

		This ethic is inevita - ble .

		The subject-matter of art is human life and hu - man interests ; and to exclude the ethic from a consid - eration of human life , or speak of life without an ethic , would be like speaking of a season without weather .

		It may be indifferent weather , but the weather is there ; and if the subject-matter of art is life which embodies an ethic , the only question is how art is affected by this ethic which life embodies .

		But , besides , the artist can - not , though he would , prevent the ethic of his own character from permeating the substance of his work .

		Just so the literature of any community or epoch is a reflex of the society which produces and enjoys it ; and a noble and healthy life will idealize itself in noble and healthy imaginations , just as surely as an unclean or a blase society will occupy its mind with corresponding studies .

		In respect of creative literature , the ethic of art rightly considered , and the ethic of life in its high - est interpretations , will be found not only to move in the same course , but virtually to be identical in sub - stance .

		By virtue of its ethic , art will endeavor to es - chew what is unwholesome , just as nature endeavors to throw off disease and society to purge itself of social corruption .

		Being , as it were , the flower of the human instinct after perfection and permanence , it will turn its first desire to those ideas and imaginations that make for health , and will seek to embody them in creations which stir and appeal to all healthful emotions and to the sense of what is both beautiful and good .

NEWMAN VERSUS SE	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Descanting on English Imperfects Passive , in the Ap - pendix to my `` Modern English '' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , I say , re - specting '' the sort of phraseology under consideration , '' that '' some of the choicest of living English writers employ it freely . ''

		I proceed : '' Preeminent among these stands Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, who wrote , as far back as
1846	DATE	, '' etc. .

		A single relevant citation from him is then adduced .

		Mr.
R. O. Williams	PERSON	, iu your issue of
September 1	DATE	, takes exception to my qualifier `` freely . ''

		He adds : `` Although I have noticed two instances -LRB- one in a letter -RRB- , besides the one cited above by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, where the ' imperfect passive ' was employed by Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, yet I am confident that its use by him at least in print was very rare . ''

		In
1879	DATE	, the Rev. Professor
John Earle	PERSON	published what follows , from a letter addressed by Dr.
Newman	PERSON	to the Rev.
George	PERSON	Buckle : '' It surprises me that my antipathy to ' is being ' existed so long ago .

		It is as keen and bitter now as ever it was , though I do n't pretend to be able to defend it .

		... Ration - ally , or irrationally , I have an undying , never-dying hatred to ` is being , ' whatever arguments are brought in its favor .

		At the same time , I fully grant that it is so convenient , in the present state of the language , that I will not pledge myself I have never been guilty of using it . ''

		Here we have Dr.
Newman	PERSON	all over : a man with whom , avowedly , feeling had the ascendancy over reason ; who could hate intensely , however valid the demonstration might be that he should not hate at all ; who , nevertheless , was not sure that his hatred , though '' undying , never-dying , '' had not sometimes been in abeyance ; and who could confess all this explicitly .

		But neither subtility nor learning is any warrant for ethical sanity .

		And why , one may ask , if imperfects passive are '' con - venient in the present state of the language , '' would they not have been equally convenient in ages gone by ?

		His or it sufficed the contemporaries of
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	, as a neuter possessive ; but would its , if it had been evolved in their day , have proved to be less con - venient than it has proved to be for hard on three centuries ?

		As far back as
1838	DATE	I began the practice , which I have kept up ever since , of desultorily jotting down : notes on points of English .

		Of those notes , which for many years were made solely for my own instruction , a group stood me in good stead , when , in
1871	DATE	, 1 drew up 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, my paper on '' English Imperfects Passive , '' and sent it to
America	LOCATION	, where it was published in '' Scribner 's Monthly '' for
April , 1872	DATE	.

		At that time , satisfied , for the most part , analysis apart , with a chronological in - vestigation , and with showing that a noticeable array of authors already become classic Sonthey ,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and Landor had not scorned the construction in question , I troubled myself but little to cite authori - ties for it of more recent date .

		It was from being re - minded how highly Dr.
Newman	PERSON	was esteemed , for his style , among writers then living , that , on recasting my paper in
1873	DATE	, I summoned him as supporting the form of locution therein discussed .

		A twelvemonth pre - viously when , in reading the first series of his '' Essays Critical and Historical , '' I there encountered '' are be - ing led '' it occurred to me that I had not brought for - ward anything similar from him in my paper , and it also came back to me that I had , in the past , observed his use , repeatedly , of like expressions .

		Since 1872 I have hardly done more than casually dip into any of his writings , his posthumous Letters excepted .

		True as it is that I quoted him but once for imperfects passive , yet I was convinced , when doing so , that I might speak as I did of his lending them his countenance .

		My mem - ory , though I seldom trust to it , seldom plays me false .

		Not only are Dr.
Newman	PERSON	's literary productions nu - merous , but the minor ones , of which many have not been collected , are widely scattered : not even the Cat - alogue of the British Museum guides one to anything like all of them .

		Still , as has been seen , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is '' confident '' that the occurrence , in them , of imper - fects passive is '' very rare . ''

		He speaks of two appo - site quotations from them , besides that which I for - merly gave .

		If he had gone farther afield , he would have made the discovery that the eloquent visionary manifested , practically , nothing perceptible of the '' hatred to ' is being ' '' which he was so incautious and oblivions as to profess .

		Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, in his letter quoted in a preceding par - agraph as well as by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, expresses himself as if , in his eyes , imperfects passive were things to be catholicly eschewed ubique , semper , et ab omnibus , and were on a par with , say , lay for lie , set for sit , and expect for suspect .

		The latter he would , no doubt , have held to be inexcusable , absolutely ; but the former , de - spite his passionate reprobation of them , seem to have been rather attractive to him .

		Between 1832 and
1846	DATE	he was , according to his own adjudication , `` guilty of '' : '' I fear the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is being corrupted by the union . ''

		It turns out , then , that Dr.
Newman	PERSON	's `` undying , never-dying hatred '' of imperfects passive was , in all likelihood , a mere transient spasm of displacency , pos - sibly due to bile or indigestion .

		Alternatively , may not the abhorrent employment of them have served him as an act of penance , in lieu of cultivating fleas inside his shirt , or disciplining himself with a cat-o ' - nine-taiis ?

		Copying passages where , besides signifying an em - phatic aversion to the late
Bp	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wilberforce , I refer to somebody as having ridiculed him for using a term which that somebody characterizes as `` jargon , '' Mr.
Williams	PERSON	would have me , in the name of consistency , cancel my inclusion of the Bishop among '' the choicest of living English writers . ''

		But , under favor , things entirely disparate are not to be confounded . ''

		We find , we confess , '' comments Lord Macaulay , '' so great a charm in Mr.
Southey	PERSON	's style , that , even when he writes nonsense , we generally read it with pleasure , except , in - deed , when he tries to be droll . ''

		Why , pray , may not a man be , personally , ever so objectionable , and also go the length of venting the most indisputable balderdash , and yet be , as a rhetorician , a very model of excellence ?

		In the hope , apparently , of scoring a point of some sort against me , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	allows himself in a rash venture , or something worse .

		He credits me with hav - ing contributed to the '' New English Dictionary '' the quotation in which Dr.
Newman	PERSON	has '' are being led . ''

		THE LIFE AXD LETTERS OF
AIST AMERICAN NATURALIST	ORGANIZATION	.

		* While the '' Letters of Asa Gray , '' recently issued under the editorship of
Jane Loring Gray	PERSON	, appeal , prima facie , chiefly to the scien - tific reader , they will be found fairly rich in matter of general interest and entertainment .

		Happily , with Dr.
Gray	PERSON	, intense devotion to a specialty did not result in a form of brain par - alysis as to interests outside of it .

		He was an enthusiastic traveller , a lover of art and of literature , and his letters and the records of his European journeys testify throughout to his liberal tastes and his lively concern in the bustling activities of the unlearned world about him .

		In point of style , the letters , while they lack that special literary charm which has its pictorial analogue in color , show the same excellent prose qualities of clearness and pre - cision that go to make the writer 's botanical text-books the best of their kind .

		His corre - spondence with eminent co-workers ,
Darwin	PERSON	, De Candolle , Dr.
Torrey	PERSON	,
Hooker	PERSON	, and others , is , of course , well seasoned with scientific dis - cussion and comment ; and here his habitual effort at clear and full expression largely the fruit of much expository writing and lec - turing stands the lay reader in good stead .

		In making her selection , the editor has aimed to present the story of Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's life as far as possible in his own words , and to this end she has prefixed to the '' Letters '' a brief '' Autobiography '' a dry abstract of the writer 's early life , chiefly valuable for the glimpses it gives of his boyhood and His ances - try .

		Serious biographical deficiencies in the epistolary record are supplied by a running thread of editorial comment and rather full notes .

		Dr.
Gray	PERSON	came , on his father 's side , of that sturdy Scotch-Irish stock to which
America	LOCATION	owes so many strong men and excellent women .

		His early life was not without its privations , but he was of the right metal to bear them cheerfully at first and to turn them to account afterwards .

		Born in
1810	DATE	in
Sauquoit	LOCATION	,
Oneida County	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, his first recollections were of
Paris	LOCATION	Furnace Hollow , a neighboring village where his father had set up a small tannery .

		Of this establishment he retained some vivid recollections , especially those connected with * THE LETTERS OF ASA GRAY .

		Edited by
Jane Loring Gray	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		the first use to which he was put , '' the driving round the ring of the old horse that turned the bark-mill , and the supplying the mill with its small grist of bark which , adds Dr. Gray with some feeling , was '' a lonely and monot - onous occupation . ''

		He was sent to the district school at the age of three , and , later , to a small '' select '' school at Sauquoit , whence , at twelve , he went to the
Clinton Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	, where he was drilled in the rudiments of Latin and Greek for two years , '' excepting , '' he writes , '' the three
summer	DATE	months , when I was taken home to assist in the corn and hayfield . ''

		From the
Clinton	PERSON	school he was transferred -LRB- 1825 -RRB- to
Fairfield Academy	LOCATION	,
Herkimer County	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	; and at this point in his recital the Doctor pauses to say something of that '' omnivorous reading which was , after all , the larger part of my education . ''

		History he '' rather took to , '' but -LRB- like Kant -RRB- he especially delighted in voyages and travels .

		In the little circulating library at Sauquoit there were no plays , not even
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but there was a comfortable sprinkling of novels ; and the future botanist spent many cheerful and not unprofitable hours over those honored favorites , ''
Rob Roy	PERSON	, '' ``
Quentin Durward	PERSON	, '' `` The Children of the Abbey , '' and , notably , that soul-stirring pro- duction , '' Thaddeus of
Warsaw	LOCATION	. ''

		Later , he obtained access to the Pho3nix Society library , of
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	, which was especially `` strong in novels . ''

		`` I suppose , '' says the Doctor , without any apparent twinges of the scientific conscience , '' that I read them every one . ''

		In the
autumn of 1826	DATE	Dr. Gray -LRB- compelled to abandon the idea of going to college -RRB- entered the medical school at
Fairfield	LOCATION	; and here , dur - ing the winter of the following year , his tastes and energies were half-fortuitously turned into their final channel by the article in
Brewster	PERSON	's ''
Edinburgh Encyclopedia	LOCATION	'' on '' Botany '' '' a poor thing , '' he says , '' but it interested me much . ''

		What the fatal map of
Namur	LOCATION	was to
Uncle Toby	ORGANIZATION	, the article on Botany proved to be to Dr.
Gray	PERSON	; and thenceforward his progress was rapid .

		His interest in botany began thus , in midwinter , when he was out of reach , as he says , even of a greenhouse or of a potted plant .

		Early in the
spring	DATE	, however -LRB- 1828 -RRB- , he sallied forth into the bare woods eager as a boy to his .

		first trout-stream and found , to his great joy , an early plant in flower , peeping through the dead leaves at the vanish - ing winter .

		This treasure he bore home , and , with the aid of
Eaton	ORGANIZATION	's '' Manual , '' he ran it 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, down to its name ,
Claytonia Virginica	LOCATION	. ''

		I was well pleased , '' he writes , '' and went on collecting and examining all the flowers I could lay hands on .

		... I began an herbarium of shockingly bad specimens . ''

		In the
spring of 1830	DATE	Dr.
Gray	PERSON	became professor of natural sciences at Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	's School at
Utica	LOCATION	, and in the
autumn of 1836	DATE	he was appointed cura - tor of the new
Lyceum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, whose hall was his home for a year or two .

		In
1838	DATE	he was appointed professor in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, with the under - standing that he was to have a year abroad .

		Of this first European journey a detailed and lively account is given in the letters and jour - nals already alluded to .

		On his return from
Europe	LOCATION	, in
1840	DATE	, the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	not yet needing his services , he settled in
New York	LOCATION	to his work on the '' Flora of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- already begun by his life-long friend , Dr.
Torrey	PERSON	-RRB- , and Parts 3 and 4 of Vol .

		I. were issued in
June	DATE	of that year .

		The au - tobiographical fragment closes abruptly about the period of Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's acceptance -LRB- in the
spring of 1842	DATE	-RRB- of a chair at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He writes : '' Sometime in
January , 1842	DATE	, 1 made a visit of two or three days to
B. D. Greene	PERSON	in
Boston	LOCATION	; the first time I ever saw
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Came out one day to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, dined with his father-in-law , President
Quincy	PERSON	; the company to meet us was Professor
Channing	PERSON	and Pro- fessor
Treadwell	PERSON	.

		Sometime in
April	DATE	, I received a letter from President
Quincy	PERSON	, telling me that the cor - poration of the university would elect me
Fisher	PERSON	Pro- fessor of natural history if I would beforehand signify my acceptance .

		The endowment then yielded fifteen hundred dollars a year .

		I was to have a thousand and allow the rest to accumulate for a while .

		Meanwhile I was to give only a course of botanical lectures , in the second
spring	DATE	term , and look after the Garden .

		But more work was soon added .

		I came in
July	DATE	, in the midst of vacation , before Commencement , which was then in
September	DATE	; got lodgings , with room for my then small herbarium , in the house of Deacon Munroe . ''

		Of Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's character and personality , the editor affords us some interesting glimpses .

		He was a singularly amiable , engaging man , alert , merry , animated , in touch with current life and thought , not at all the conventional
Gelehrter	PERSON	-LRB-
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	in the study and
Kaspar Hauser	PERSON	out of it -RRB- of the cloistered German type , yet not , it seems , without a touch of the artlessness in lesser practical matters that so often forms an agreeable foil to profound learn - ing .

		Deeply interested in the religious thought of the day , he was -LRB- like all thinking men who have the matter at heart -RRB- reticent as to his own religious feelings , and sensitive about any exhibition of them .

		He was a constant church - goer .

		When travelling , he always made Sun - day a resting day , and he would slip away quietly in the morning to find some place of worship .

		He enjoyed the Episcopal service , though early habit and training had made him a Presbyterian .

		He once wrote : '' In fact , I have no more fondness for high Calviuistic theology than for German neology ... But I have no penchant for melancholy , sober as I sometimes look , but turn always , like the leaves , niy face to the sun . ''

		Reading between the lines here , one fancier that the hiatus above , if supplied , might per - chance contain a reference to the binding , if sometimes unwelcome , force of strict dialectics .

		We have alluded to the Doctor 's character - istic alertness .

		Says the editor : '' In the street he was usually on a half run , for he never allowed himself quite time enough to reach his destination leisurely .

		When travelling by coach and climbing a hill , he would sometimes alarm his fellow - travellers by suddenly disappearing through a window in his eagerness to secure some plant he had spied ; his haste would not suffer him to open a door .

		As his motions were quick , so that he seemed always ready for a
spring	DATE	, so he found instant relaxation by throwing himself flat on the floor when tired , to rest , like a child . ''

		At the time of the Civil War , Dr. Gray threw himself into the current of discussion with his usual earnestness .

		His letters of the period ring with a fine , uncompromising patri - otism , and he put his own hand to the work so far as he was able . ''

		A company of the men who were too old or other - wise incapacitated from going to the front was enlisted in
Cambridge	LOCATION	to guard the
State Arsenal	ORGANIZATION	there , and also to be ready to be summoned in any emergency ; and he joined the ranks and was faithful in the drilling and every duty to which they were called . ''

		Like his friend
Darwin	PERSON	, Dr.
Gray	PERSON	was devoted to pets especially to `` man 's friend , the dog . ''

		His prime favorite was-the black - and-tan terrier '' Max , '' an animal neither especially beautiful nor gifted , but interesting for its warm affection and the power it had of developing its intelligence . ''

		To be near and to please his beloved master was enough for him .

		Anything his master did was right and to be submitted to .

		Max had conscience , but it did not restrain him from showing his vexation when left at home , by throwing Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's hat and gloves , etc. , on the floor ; but his shame and penitence always betrayed him .

		It seemed as if the joy of his master 's return had killed him . ''

		Max 's pathetic demise is thus chronicled by his master in a letter to Darwin : '' Let me add , being sure of your sympathy , that our poor dog Max peacefully breathed his last to-day , after a happy life of twelve or thirteen years .

		We are glad he lived till we returned , and greeted us with his absorb - ing and touching affection .

		In a few days came a par -

		He is immortalized in your book on Expression , and will live in the memory of his attached master and mistress . ''

		Passing on now to the letters , our remaining space shall be given mainly to citations from an interesting series classified by the editor as written to `` Darwin and Others 1860-1868 . ''

		Unfortunately , the letters written to
Darwin	PERSON	previous to 1862 were destroyed save the one dated
January 23 , 1860	DATE	, published in his '' Life and Letters , '' and reprinted in the pres - ent work .

		Dr. Gray seems to have met Dar - win first in
1839	DATE	, at the
London	LOCATION	College of Surgeons ; and , later , we read in Mrs.
Gray	PERSON	's English journal -LRB- 1851 -RRB- of `` an invitation to lunch from the Hookers , ' to meet Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	, who is coming to meet Dr.
Hooker	PERSON	; is dis - tinguished as a naturalist . ' ' ''

		Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	was a lively , agreeable person . '' ''

		The Origin of Species '' having appeared in
1859	DATE	, the letters from which we quote were written while discussion of its main position was at a white heat .

		Writing to
J. D. Hooker	PERSON	,
Jan	PERSON	- uary 5 ,
1860	DATE	, Dr.
Gray	PERSON	says : '' The principal part of your letter was high laudation of
Darwin	PERSON	's book . ''

		Well , the book has reached me , and I finished its careful perusal four days ago ; and I freely say that your laudation is not out of place . ''

		It is done in a masterly manner .

		It might well have taken twenty years to produce it .

		It is crammed full of most interesting matter , thoroughly digested , well expressed , close , cogent ; and taken as a system it makes out a better case than I had supposed possi - ble ... '' I doubt if I shall please you -LSB- in his review for ' Sil - liman 's Journal ' -RSB- altogether .

		I know I shall not please Agassiz at all .

		I hear another reprint is in the press , and the book will excite much attention here , and some - controversy ... '' Writing to the author himself ,
January 23 , 1860	DATE	, Dr.
Gray	PERSON	says : '' I hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from
New Haven	LOCATION	and send them to you , and will ask you to pass them on to Dr.
Hooker	PERSON	. ''

		To fulfil your request , I ought to tell you what I think the weakest , and what the best , part of your book .

		But this is not easy , nor to be done in a word or two .

		The best part , 1 think , is the whole , that is , its plan and treatment , the vast amount of facts and acute infer - ences handled as if you had a perfect mastery of them .

		I do not think twenty years too much time to produce such a book in . ''

		Style clear and good , but now and then wants re - vision for little matters -LRB- p. 97 , self-fertilizes itself , etc. -RRB- . ''

		Then your candor is worth everything to your cause .

		It is refreshing to find a person with a new theory who frankly confesses that he finds difficulties , insurmount - able at least for the present .

		I know some people who never have any difficulties to speak of . ''

		The moment I understood your premises , I felt sure you had a real foundation to hold on .

		Well , if one ad - mits your premises , I do not see how he is to stop short of your conclusions , as a probable hypothesis at least . ''

		It naturally happens that my review of your book does not exhibit anything like the full force of the im - pression the book has made upon me .

		Under the cir - cumstances I suppose I do your theory more good here , by bespeaking for it a fair and favorable consideration , and by standing noncommitted as to its full conclusion , than I should if I announced myself a convert ; nor could I say the latter with truth .

		`` Well , what seems to me the weakest point in the book is the attempt to account for the formation of or - gans , the making of eyes , etc. , by natural selection .

		Some of this reads quite Lamarckian .

		The chapter on Hybridism is not a weak , but a strong chapter .

		You have done wonders there .

		But still you have not ac - counted , as you may be held to account , for divergence up to a certain extent producing increased fertility of the crosses , but carried one short , almost imperceptible , step more , giving rise to sterility , or reversing the ten - dency .

		... I am free to say that I have never learnt so much from one book as I have from yours . ''

		Writing to
R. W. Church	PERSON	,
May 7 , 1861	DATE	, Dr.
Gray	PERSON	defends and defines his review of '' The Origin of Species '' -LRB- '' Darwiniana '' -RRB- : '' I am gratified , also , by your apprehending the spirit and object of my essay on Darwin so much bet - ter than many who write to me about it .

		All it pre - tends to is to warn the reckless and inconsiderate to state the case as it is ; to protest against the folly of those who would , it would seem , go on to fire away the very ramparts of the citadel in defense of needless out - posts ; and , as you justly remark , to clear the way for a fair discussion of a new theory on its merits and evi - dence . '

		We must use the theory a while in botany and in zoology , and see how it will work ; in this way a few years will test it thoroughly .

		I incline to think that its principles will be to a certain extent admitted in science , but that , as
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	conceives it , it will prove quite in - sufficient . ''

		In a letter to
Darwin	PERSON	of
October 10 , 1860	DATE	, the Doctor , alluding to British comments on American illiteracy , offers an amusing tu quoque : '' Some of the representations of us in the English pa - pers would be amusing if they did not now do so great harm .

		One would think it was generally thought that there was no law and order here , nor gentlemanly con - duct , nor propriety of deportment among the poorer and laboring people .

		I wish you could come and see .

		As to such things , and as to intelligence , education , etc. , I have sometimes thought of the picture one could draw from individual cases .

		Take one very confidentially for I would not hurt a really good fellow by expos - ing his ignorance of what he might be expected to know .

		Here we lately had a
Cambridge	LOCATION	graduate -LRB- F.L.S. , and godson of an English baronet -RRB- who in one conversation let us know most frankly that he had no idea where
Quito	LOCATION	was , or that there were two houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, and was puzzled to know whether
Boston	LOCATION	,
United States	LOCATION	, time was faster or slower than that of
Greenwich !	LOCATION

		... '' The following note may smack of irreverence 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, and of a disregard for constituted authority ; but we quote it for its humor : '' There is some jolly science in the '
Saturday	DATE	Re - view , ' now and then ; as in
December 28	DATE	, p. 665 , where we are informed that icebergs ' are formed by the splashing of the waves on the coast of Labrador . ' ''

		In letters to
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	written
May 26	DATE	and
July 21 , 1863	DATE	, we find some interesting refer - ences to Professor Owen : '' Your letter on heterogeny is keen and good ;
Owen	PERSON	's rejoinder ingenious .

		But his dissent from your well - put claims of natural selection to attention and regard is good for nothing except on the admission of the view that species are somehow derived genealogically ; and this I judge , from various of
Owen	PERSON	's statements , that he really in his heart believes to be the case , and was -LRB- as I long ago intimated my suspicions -RRB- hunting about for some system of derivation , when your book came down upon him like a thunderclap . '' ''

		I have been reading
Owen	PERSON	's Aye-aye paper .

		Well , this is rich and cool !

		Did I not tell you in the ' At - lantic ' long ago , that
Owen	PERSON	had a transmutation theory of his own !

		It is your Hamlet , with the part of Ham - let left out !

		But as you say now , you do n't so much insist on natural selection , if you can only have deriva - tion of species .

		And
Owen	PERSON	goes in for derivation on the largest scale .

		You may as well lovingly embrace !

		Oh , it is rare fun !

		... '' In a note to
Darwin	PERSON	,
April 14 , 1871	DATE	, there are some humorous signs of yielding on the Doctor 's part . ''

		You have , '' he says , '' such a way of putting things , and you write in such a captivating way .

		One can only say : Almost thou persuadest me to have been ' a hairy quad - ruped , of arboreal habits , furnished with a tail and pointed ears , ' etc. '' Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's critique of the popular little book called '' How Plants Behave '' is amusing : '' By the hand of an old correspondent of yours , and cousin of ours , Mr.
Brace	PERSON	, I send you a little book , which may amuse you , in seeing your ' own science adapted to juvenile minds .

		In some of those hours in which you can do no better than read , or hear read , ' trashy novels , ' you might try this instead .

		It will hardly rival the ` Jumping Frog , ' and the like speci - mens of American literature which you first made known to us ... '' We may fittingly close our perhaps rather too-Darwinian series of extracts with the fol - lowing note -LRB- embodying an important autobio - graphical fact -RRB- to Dr.
G. F. Wright	PERSON	-LRB-
1875	DATE	-RRB- : '' ... A minister out in
Illinois	LOCATION	has written me , tak - ing me seriously to task for altering my opinion after the age of forty-five , and for abetting disorder , by sup - porting theories that disturb the harmony of opinion that ought to prevail among scientific men . ''

		He is one of those people who think that if you shut your eyes hard , it will answer every purpose ; in - deed , from the ease with which he confutes Darwinism , I suppose he finds no call even to shut his eyes . ''

		Convinced of the probable truth of
Darwin	PERSON	- ism , and welcoming it as a good working hy - pothesis , the writer saw in it nothing to disturb , or , indeed , to trench upon , his religious beliefs .

		Matters of faith and matters of possible knowl - edge he kept separate and distinct , each in its own province .

		Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's '' Letters '' are interesting and valuable not only through the eminence of the writer , but through that of the recipients the drift of whose replies is usually fairly inferable .

		The editor has done her work thor - oughly and well , and the publishers have con - formed to their usual standards .

		A NEW HISTORY OF POLITICAL , ECOXOMY .

		* Dr.
Luigi Cossa	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Study of Political Economy , '' translated into English at the instance of
Jevons	PERSON	, has long maintained a high reputation in
America	LOCATION	.

		The '' Introduc - tion to the Study of Political Economy , '' be - gun as a revision of the '' Guide , '' but really a new work , is far more comprehensive and im - portant , and , as an interpreter of the history of the science , is , for English readers , without a rival .

		The '' extraordinary extent and accuracy of Dr.
Cossa	PERSON	's knowledge of the economic lit - erature of almost all nations , '' which
Jevons	PERSON	noted in the '' Guide , '' is here extended and deepened , and enriched by a luminous style full of felicitous , penetrating , and discriminating statements .

		In closeness of texture and in con - structive grasp the work is perhaps inferior to
Ingram	PERSON	's `` History of Political Economy '' ; but
Cossa	PERSON	, though chatty and conversational in tone , is far more complete and necessarily in better perspective .

		The main part of the book is taken up with an historical review of economic doctrine from the earliest antiquity down to the latest manu - script treatises of the year
1893	DATE	.

		This prodi - gious task , requiring for its successful perform - ance enormous learning , patient analysis , and intelligent sympathy , is so well done as to leave almost nothing to be desired ; and the earlier writings take their proper place as fragment - ary speculations .

		THE DIAL 337 the flowering of the science in
Adam Smith	PERSON	and his successors , are exhibited with great skill .

		The author 's conception of current economic tendencies is also keen , and his analysis of cur - rent economic writings shows no lack of in - sight and critical grasp .

		Here , however , the reader 's perspective is more or less lost , and naturally there will be less agreement with the author 's judgments .

		Throughout , there are many felicitous characterizations , as , for ex - ample , of the economy of the churchmen -LRB- p. 138 -RRB- , of the mercantile system -LRB- p. 207 -RRB- , of pro- tection stumbling upon the unity of all indus - trial action -LRB- p. 240 -RRB- .

		Not less suggestive is the theoretical side of the book .

		The mooted points of definition , re - lation to other branches of knowledge , char - acteristics , terms , and method , are treated with thoroughness and moderation .

		The author is not an economic eclectic , but belongs to the militant wing of the reformed classical school .

		Much of the vigor and sustained power of the book undoubtedly comes from his steady ad - herence to the point of view ; and this also marks its limitations .

		There is no better place anywhere to study the excellences and defects of the new classical school .

		Cossa does not believe that a single position won by orthodox economy has been surrendered .

		`` Fifteen years ago waverers stood trembling by while skeptics predicted the ruin , total and immediate , of English economics .

		But facts are stubborn things , and facts have gone against them '' -LRB- p. 354 -RRB- .

		But English economy is not the thing it has been popularly represented to be .

		The extravagant assump - tions and deductions of the earlier and middle years of the century are unceremoniously dis - carded .

		Indeed , these assumptions and deduc - tions , he tells us , were never really justified by the classical writers .

		It is not the fault of Mal - thus and Ricardo that they failed to make them - selves understood .

		The '' Manchester School '' is a German myth -LRB- pp. 361 , 369 -RRB- ;
Bastiat	PERSON	, with his physiocratic notions of '' indefinite pro- gress , '' and some few second-rate writers , are its real representatives . ''

		Laissez-faire is any - thing but a scientific dogma .

		It is nothing but a hypothesis in social economics , and in polit - ical economy it is a rule of art , subject as such to noteworthy exceptions '' -LRB- p. 104 -RRB- .

		The '' all sufficiency of enlightened selfishness '' goes by the board . ''

		Another serious error of Ques - nay 's school was their assertion of laissez-faire as a scientific axiom , when it is no better than any other rule of thumb , and requires frequent violation in cases where otherwise there would be collision between private interests and the common weal '' -LRB- p. 271 -RRB- .

		Of the economic struggle in
England	LOCATION	during the present century , for whose attitude toward it the classical school has been so severely censured , he says : '' Many vexatious and outward forms of governmental interference were abrogated , to the delight of all , while little account was taken of doctrinaire scruples in favor of laissez-faire '' -LRB- p. 325 -RRB- .

		The '' healthy liberty favored by the classical school '' thus disarms criticism , while the `` hard - and-fast dogmatism of laissez-faire defended by the optimists '' -LRB- p. 400 -RRB- and the '' barbaric lit - eralness of Spencer '' -LRB- p. 362 -RRB- are made to serve as scapegoats ; and he speaks of
Berardi	PERSON	, '' who compounded out of
Ferrara	PERSON	and
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	a deadly decoction of laissez-faire '' -LRB- p. 506 -RRB- .

		The main premises of the classical school are given on page 74 .

		These are , first , the law of the least sacrifice .

		In economic functions the lead - ing motive of average human action is profit and loss , which prompts us to aim at the greatest gain in return for the least possible expenditure of effort , sacrifice , and risk .

		Second , the law of diminishing returns .

		Third , the law of population man 's proneness to multiply upon the earth beyond the means of subsistence .

		These , taken together with hypothetical free competition , are the basis of the deductive theories of the classical school .

		Attention is called to the accidental and various causes which science neglects , but which rarely fail to traverse the foreseen results of constant causes -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- .

		Cossa 's definition of the sci - ence is much broader than the traditional one .

		`` Not wealth , which is but a complex and shifting sum of material goods , but man 's business with wealth , is the subject-matter of political economy '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .

		Pure and ap - plied economics are rigidly separated . ''

		Pure economics explains phenomena for which it is not responsible , and which it can not alter . '' ''

		The field of a science is one thing , and the rules of an art are another '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- . ''

		It is one thing to determine fair wages , ... but it is quite a different thing to state in a strictly and scientifically correct fashion the economic theory of wages '' -LRB- p. 13 -RRB- .

		The reformed clas - sical school , however , is willing to concede that there is such a legitimate thing as applied economics , and , granting its main contention regarding the function and method of pure economics , it is ready , as
Cossa	PERSON	shows , to take a very generous view of the importance of the art of political economy .

		338 THE DIAL -LSB- Dee .

		1 , '' Ethical considerations modify in various ways the action and reaction of profit and loss , which is the chief force in economic phenomena taken in the concrete '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- . ''

		Applied economics must rank as subsidiary and inferior to ethics , because the attainment of no purely economical advantage can justify a violation of ethical principles .

		Wealth is only a means to the end of pre - serving man and bringing him to ethical perfection .

		Ac - cordingly , in any partial conflict between ethical and economic motives the former must prevail .

		For in - stance , the employment of child-labor in factories would be regulated by
State	ORGANIZATION	interference on ethical grounds , even if there were no other reason or justification what - ever for interference '' -LRB- p. 30 -RRB- .

		This is a very different classicism from what we were accustomed to hear expounded in the school-room a generation ago .

		Yet , with all its modifications , it re-affirms the fundamental premises of the classical school , and these ,
Cossa	PERSON	believes , can not be seriously shaken .

		Ethical considerations modify in various ways , '' but
Dargun	PERSON	can not be right in asking any - one to build up a new economics based upon sympathy or on love for one 's neighbor '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- .

		Indeed , this idea of substituting the Golden Rule for the economic motive of self - interest is to
Cossa	PERSON	unthinkable . ''

		Grant to the socialists their delusive dream , wipe out of existence wealth as a social system , humor them and allow that injustice is inherent in the exercise of liberty , which brings inevitable pauperism and constantly recurring crises wherever it goes , what will socialism thus humored to the full of its bent do for you ?

		It will create a system of economic policy tending wholly to eliminate or at least partially to paralyze private property and competition .

		What experience have we of any system of economic order which does not hinge upon these two cardinal institutions in the established order of to-day ? ''

		-LRB- p. 516 -RRB- .

		Alas !

		alas !

		And yet there are those among us foolish enough to contemplate such a possi - bility without a shudder , and to dream , in spite of
Cossa	ORGANIZATION	's fantastic anathema -LRB- p. 515 -RRB- , of that time when the Kingdom of Heaven shall really come on the earth !

		LIFE WITH TRANS-SIBERIAX SAVAGES .

		* In Mr.
Douglas Howard	PERSON	's little book , '' Life with Trans-Siberian Savages , '' we have a sketchy all too sketchy account of expe - riences among that most interesting people , the
Ainu of Saghalien	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our author claims to * LIFE WITH TRANS-SIBERIAN SAVAGES .

B. Douglas Howard	PERSON	.

		have lived with them , to have tilted in medical contest with their Shaman , to have been in - ducted into a chieftaincy .

		These are unusual advantages , and we are justified in expecting much new matter from his pen .

		He himself realizes this , and trusts that his book will be '' found both interesting and instructive to the general as well as to the scientific reader . ''

		Unfortunately , however , he adds little to our actual knowledge of the Ainu .

		Mr.
Howard	PERSON	shows himself unacquainted with the history of exploration among the Ainu .

		It is scarcely true that no one has written about the Saghalien Ainu for nearly three hundred years .

		Batchelor 's book appears to have suggested
Howard	PERSON	's name for the peo - ple of whom he writes .

		Most authors speak of Ai ` no or Aino , of A'mos or Ainos : Batch - elor insists that we should say Ainu , and uses the same form in singular and plural .

		How - ard , however , uses Ainus for a plural a rather unwarranted proceeding .

		There is much yet to learn of the physical characteristics of the Ainu , and Mr.
Howard	PERSON	might have made observations , a report of which would have great value and interest .

		But he does not add anything to our knowl - edge in these respects .

		The description of the first Ainu he saw will show how little exact science may gain from him .

		He says : '' `` The flesh-tint of this human phenomenon was that of pale Turkish tobacco ; the frame massive ; face large , stupid , blank , expressionless ; forehead low , and almost concealed by a mass of hair as black and shiny as a highly polished boot .

		This was parted , with much evi - dent care , exactly in the middle , and hung loosely over the shoulders after the fashion of Eve by the old mas - ters . ''

		There is another page full of similar descrip - tion .

		Here and there , in his narrative of inci - dents of travel , not unpleasantly told , we gather bits of interesting ethnographic matter .

		A vil - lage is described ; food and cookery , dress , fishing , hunting , the use of inaos , treatment of disease , care of the dead , are matters referred to more or less fully .

		No one , so far as we know , gives so good a description of friction - made fire among Ainu : '' A rough little apparatus was produced , consisting of two little blocks of wood .

		Between these was placed a bit of very dry elm stick , one end , which we will call the lower end , being pointed so as to fit loosely into a hole in the lower block ; the other end , also pointed , being in contact only with the flat under surface of the upper block .

		A bow was then unstrung at one end , the string was passed once round the middle of the dry stick , and the free end was loosely re-attached .

		The bow was then worked with wonderful celerity , until the lower end of the stick first smoked , and then passed

		THE DIAL 339 into a fitful blaze .

		This was communicated to some fine dry twigs . ''

		The fish-skin suits worn in
Saghalien	LOCATION	are de - scribed as thin , tough , and pliable , elaborately but coarsely embroidered .

		The use of dogs by the Ainu is more fully treated than by other writers .

		The dog of the
Ainu	ORGANIZATION	is of the size of a foxhound , but has a much smaller head and is lighter built .

		Of a sandy color , darkening along the back , he is in form some - what like the wolf or fox .

		His gait is wolfish and his appearance stupid and selfish .

		These creatures , half - wild , filthy , acting as scavengers , displaying no fondness for man and only kept at work by hunger , are yet of great import - ance to the
Ainu of Saghalien	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are used in fishing , in driving deer , in hunting bears , in drawing sledges .

		Although never tied , they do not stray , and when working they are al - ways in packs or bands .

		Their use in fishing is novel , and is well-described .

		A fishing party started for the sea with about thirty dogs .

		Ar - rived at the scene of action , dogs and men were separated into two parties stationed at points two hundred yards apart .

		At a given signal the dogs plunged boldly into the water and swam out single file in two columns .

		At a sig - nal they wheeled toward each other , and when they had completed a crescentric line turned in toward the shore .

		As they drew near the land and the line contracted , fishes were driven in to shallow water .

		Here the dogs seized them and brought them to their masters .

		From Mr.
Howard	PERSON	's description of the bear-hunt it appears that the animal 's throat is severed im - mediately after he is killed ; the heart is re - moved , and the blood-vessels are opened .

		Mr.
Howard	PERSON	twice refers to message sticks .

		There are reasons why fuller details regarding these would have been of great interest .

		Possibly the most interesting ethnographic item is in reference to the preparation of ar - row poison .

		Mr.
Howard	PERSON	claims to have been regularly instructed in this art .

		Aconite roots , carefully cleaned and scraped , were sliced and pounded to a powder .

		This was placed in water , and boiled until two-thirds of the fluid had evaporated .

		It was then strained , and still further reduced by boiling .

		The residue was placed in a sea-shell .

		Six dead spiders were then powdered , put into water , and boiled down .

		This was put in a second shell .

		The gall bladders of three freshly-killed foxes were then taken , and the gall boiled down and put in a third shell .

		The two valves of a bivalve were now carefully cleaned .

		In one of them the three materials were carefully mixed with a little spatula of bone or wood .

		The unmixed mate - rials and the mixture were both sanctified by ceremonies before the sacred whittled sticks or inaos .

		After testing the mixture by dipping the tip of a spear of grass into it and touching it to the tongue , the upper valve was adjusted to the one containing the poison and the edges ' were gummed together .

		It is when we read a description as exact as this that we most regret that our author has not given us more of value .

		It happens that the Ainu just now are at - tracting considerable attention .

		Batchelqr 's wonderfully good book on the
Ainu of Yezo	ORGANIZATION	is recent .

		Now we have this volume of
Howard	ORGANIZATION	's , and very lately
David MacRitchie	PERSON	's work , '' The Ai ` nos , '' appeared .

		This last , a very curious and interesting book , is by a man who has not seen the Ainu himself .

		It consists of the re - production of a remarkable series of Japanese drawings and paintings of Ainu , with some notes and remarks upon the people and their customs as therein shown .

		The pictures -LRB- the originals of which are in various European museums of ethnography -RRB- , printed in their original colors , fill nineteen quarto plates and represent many interesting scenes .

		One con - stantly wonders at the fidelity and truth of most of these Japanese artists , even in minute details .

		We have , carefully delineated , the dress , ornaments , houses , mats , boats , inaos .

		We have , scrupulously depicted , movements , gestures , feasts , hunts , all occupations .

		Where ethnographic details are so elaborately worked out we are justified in expecting in these quaint pictures some data regarding the physical char - acteristics , which Howard fails to give us ; and these we find in
MacRitchie	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		These artists of
Japan	LOCATION	represent the Ainu with hairy body , shaven heads , skin diseases on the head .

		They also picture them with curiously irregu - lar feet furnished with claw-like nails and with a curiously deep fold in the sole of the foot .

		MacRitchie calls attention to these peculiarities , and finds in them the basis for a theory of the primitive Ainu .

		He believes that these were less human than any savage people now living .

		It is interesting to put with this Mr.
Howard	PERSON	's suggestion that the Ainu are '' straggling Ary - But much yet remains to be done , before ans .

		the origin of the
Ainu	ORGANIZATION	is settled .

		Men who work more carefully than Mr.
Howard	PERSON	must repeat his '' life among trans-Siberian savages '' before we shall know much about Saghalien Ainu .

		* Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	's '' Dodo '' shows us that the son of an Archbishop of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	may display a bent anything but ecclesiastical , or even ethical .

		It also shows us that the writer is a keen observer of things and men -LRB- includ - ing women -RRB- , and that he has no little sense of humor .

		Dodo is a delightfully wicked crea - tion , although we can not take her quite as se - riously as the author would evidently have us do .

		She clearly belongs to the world of con - ventional art of which Lamb discoursed in his essay on the dramatists of the Restoration ; a world that lies apart from the one in which we actually live , a world whose people may do and say what they please without the remotest dan - ger of influencing the conduct of anybody in the real world .

		A large part of the book sim - ply reports Dodo 's conversation , of which the following is a good example : '' Yes , I know , but you do me an injustice .

		I shall be very good to him .

		This sort of thing is almost preternaturally clever , and there is a great deal of it in the book ; in fact , there is little else that arrests the attention .

		But it palls after a hundred pages or so , and most of the other characters are lay figures . ''

		Dodo '' has been , we under - stand , a great success in
England	LOCATION	, which is not surprising , but it will be equally surprising to find anybody reading it a few years hence .

		It has the meteoric quality of such books as '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	'' and ''
Helen	PERSON	's Babies , '' and its bril - liancy is but for the hour .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	is the latest accession to the ranks of the writers from whom we are at last learn - ing what manner of people the
East Indians	LOCATION	really are .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has done much to dis - abuse the public of conventional prejudices concerning the
Indian Empire	ORGANIZATION	and its popula - tion , and Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	's work is planned upon similar lines .

		The fault of these writers is that they take too much for granted an acquaintance with the Anglo-Indian vocabulary , that they are in a certain degree obscure , if not from in - tention , at least from lack of consideration for their public . ''

		Miss
Stuart	PERSON	's Legacy '' is an exceptionally instructive and interesting tale .

		Its native characters have all the appearance of faithful studies of the types which they rep - resent ; we may safely assume them to be in all the essentials trustworthy .

		The English characters are equally well done , and one of them
John Raby	PERSON	is very nearly a triumph .

		He is the evil genius of the story , but the au - thor has resisted the temptation to paint him wholly in black ; he deserves , at times , a con - siderable share of our sympathy , and the half - tone sketch of his commonplace character illus - trates the old truth that the treatment , rather than the type selected , is what makes a char - acter interesting .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has always had a pretty taste in titles , and `` The Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' by its name alone , brings pleasurable anticipa - tions .

		Nor are they doomed to disappointment
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 in this instance , for the story is pleasing in all its aspects .

		The
Bohemia	LOCATION	upon whose coasts it bids us linger is the somewhat sophisticated and denationalized
Bohemia	LOCATION	of the
New York	LOCATION	art schools and studios ; the flavor of its life is very different from that of the enchanted re - gion which
Murger	PERSON	opened for us , but its ways are engaging if decorous , and its denizens are very much alive while not too much in earnest .

		We do not discover among them any of the queer creatures that we have rather learned to expect in a novel by Mr. Ho wells for once those crea - tures with their fads seem to have been shelved but find merely a little group of humanly in - teresting men and women , leading lives rational in the main , and brought into relations which elicit the author 's best powers of serious anal - ysis , relieved by touches of his dry and delight - ful humor .

		The manner is still that of real - ism , but a realism not too exclusive of the methods of art , and capable of giving the name of Charmian to one of the characters , no slight concession to the enemy .

		Moreover , the story is essentially a love-story , and it comes to the proper conclusion of love-stories , although there is one period of suspense when , knowing the perverse capabilities of the writer , the reader wonders if it really is going to end anywhere .

		It is well that there should be searchings of soul , but it is not well that they should rob stories as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	sometimes permits them to of their legitimate endings .

		Realism still more unrelieved than in the case of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is to be found in '' The Copperhead , '' Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	's new novel .

		But in this case it portrays a type and a set of conditions of great historical and social inter - est , and we may hardly make of its fidelity to fact a matter of reproach .

		The lot of the Northern man who , during our Civil War , openly professed his sympathy with the South - ern cause was made hard for him in a variety of ways , and of this Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	has given us a very vivid illustration in the character of
Abner Beech	LOCATION	, the
New York	LOCATION	farmer .


Toler	PERSON	- ance for the political opinions of the other party was , during that period of riotous passions , as unknown a quantity , either North or South , as was any form of religious tolerance to the Con - gregationalist of Puritan
New England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	has chosen to tell the story of his '' copperhead '' in the words of a boy who was growing towards manhood during the eventful years of the Rebellion , and we fancy that the author has put not a little autobiography into the narrative .

		The story is so naturally and unaffectedly told that it is difficult to believe it entirely '' made up '' by the novelist . ''

		Marion Darche '' will add nothing to Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's reputation .

		That skilled and ver - satile novelist could hardly fail to construct a plot of a certain degree of interest , to give life-like portraiture to the characters , and to tell his story in the literary way .

		These things he has done in the present instance , but they are not sufficient to lift the work above the level of mediocrity .

		We understand that '' Ma - rion Darche '' is written as a sort of pendant to a play upon the same theme , and the in - fluence of the dramatic manner is apparent in a number of scenes .

		It is also shown by an absence from the book of that padding in the use of which Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has been so great a sinner .

		His villain is really too despicable for probability , a defect which will be still more evident before the footlights than upon the printed page .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's '' The Son of a Prophet '' is so serious and so ambitious a piece of work that we regret to describe it as failing to inter - est. .

		But the most inveterate reader of historic fiction finds it hard to follow the tangled thread of the narrative or to project himself by its aid into the unfamiliar scenes and times with which it is concerned .

		These times are those of
King Solomon	PERSON	, and the main purpose of the author is stated as '' an attempt to create the character which uttered itself in the Book of Job , and to trace certain conditions , political , intellectual , and spiritual , which compelled this utterance . ''

		In assigning the composition of Job to this pe - riod , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	is undoubtedly in the line of the best critical opinion , and his book through - out has the marks of wide and careful scholar - ship .

		It contains eloquent pages also , and , considered in any other aspect than that of a work of fiction as a religious or historical study for example it deserves high praise .

		But the reader of novels wants his history more diluted and his religion more animated than he will find them in '' The Son of a Pro- phet , '' and we would not lure him on to disap - pointment by concealing the shortcomings of the work , as they exist from his standpoint . ''

		Ivar the Viking '' hardly pretends to be a work of fiction .

		Taking for his theme the life of a fourth century
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Du Chaillu	PERSON	gives us a reconstruction of the typical viking character , showing us his hero in all the rela - tions of life , from the cradle to the grave .

		The book is really an archaeological treatise in dis - guise .

		That the author was competent to han - 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	die this subject is not to be questioned ; few men , even among Scandinavian antiquarians , have so thoroughly qualified themselves , by mastery of the materials , for such a work .

		Mr.
Du Chaillu	PERSON	once more asserts his pet theory that the English people are of Norse rather than
Saxon	PERSON	descent a theory to which he clings undeterred by the fact that it practically finds no acceptance among serious scholars and devotes a lengthy preface to its defence .

		Even Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is invoked , and a letter is reproduced in which that versatile politician thus expresses himself : '' When I have been in
Norway	LOCATION	, or
Denmark	LOCATION	, or among
Scandina	PERSON	- vians , I have felt something like a cry of na - ture from within , asserting -LRB- credibly or other - wise -RRB- my nearness to them . ''

		This is interest - ing , but hard-headed men of science will find it about as convincing as the same writer 's vagaries in Homeric speculation .

		But Mr.
Du Chaillu	PERSON	's hobby does not materially hurt his book , which is to be commended for its vivid portraiture of an age and a race among the most interesting known to history .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	contrives to put into her work a sweet and wholesome quality that is not common in fiction , least of all in fiction that has to do with the artificial life of '' so - ciety '' in the narrow sense .

		She almost per - suades us that '' society '' has enough human interest to be worth writing about ; at all events , she convinces us that real human beings are sometimes found among the followers of its ignoble ideals .

		The sort of '' society '' to which we are introduced by such a book as '' Sweet Bells Out of Tune '' could not be adequately described without a sense of its '' humors , '' or without a readiness to satirize its trivial pre - occupations .

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	has both this sense and this readiness , and her book , in conse - quence , has much of the higher truthfulness of art .

		This becomes very apparent when we contrast it with novels that take '' society '' seriously with Mrs.
Cruger	PERSON	's books , for exam - ple .

		How animated is Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's style , and how exceptionally entertaining she can be , is particularly well illustrated by the interna - tional episode near the close of the present story .

		A wealthy social struggler from
America	LOCATION	is seeking entrance to
London	LOCATION	'' society , '' and has planned a '' function '' which a titled English dowager graciously consents to superintend .

		We quote a delightful conversational passage : '' ' The best way for you to know
America	LOCATION	is to visit it yourself some day , ' said Mrs.
Vane-Benson	PERSON	politely . ''

		` Me ?

		God forbid ! '

		said the dowager . '

		We must have all one kind of flowers in the big saloon ; foxgloves , perhaps , or orchids does your friend know orchids ?

		And there must be plenty of champagne .

		Your friend must be made to understand beforehand about cham - pagne . ' '' '

		We drink champagne by the gallon in
America	LOCATION	, ' retorted Mrs.
Vane-Benson	PERSON	in desperation . '' '

		Oh , I think not , ' said
Lady Shorthorn	PERSON	without a change of expression on her large , fair face . '

		It would make you so very sick .

		Lord
Midlands	LOCATION	himself told me when he dined at your er ah chief palace , you know the
White House	ORGANIZATION	yes , a few years ago they gave him Apollinaris only , and handed boiled milk with the coffee , in large cups , during dinner .

		You see , I 've made quite a study of
America	LOCATION	. ' ''

		I suppose , when you get everything arranged for the ball , ' resumed Mrs.
Vane-Benson	PERSON	, struggling no more , ' it will be well to let the newspapers have a list of the expected guests . ' '' '

		Perhaps ; it do n't signify who reads newspapers ? '

		said her ladyship , comfortably .

		` There are so many things in them one really ca n't believe .

		Imagine one of them saying , the other day , that your Mr. What 's - his-name had taken
Guelph House	ORGANIZATION	for the season , and if he liked it , after staying here a while , he would probably buy
England	LOCATION	.

		Now , fancy buying
England	LOCATION	how could he , possibly ? ' '

		A simple love-story , told with good taste in excellent English , with a distinct undertone of ethical meaning , is given us in '' The
Petrie Estate	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The substance of the story is famil - iar enough ; the estate in question , by reason of a misplaced will , goes , first to her , then to him , and finally to both .

		The charm of the book consists , first , in the style , then in the no - bility of the two chief characters , and , finally , in the poetic touch of the closing chapter , which gives us a glimpse of the happy pair upon the great stairway of the
Louvre	LOCATION	, their attention arrested by the Samothrace Victory , seeing in that glorious figure some sort of concrete em - bodiment of the ideals toward which their lives have been set .

		The story is unpretentious , but pleasing and wholesome .

		Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's '' The White Islander '' seems to us the most exquisite piece of work that the writer has yet done .

		Its effects are produced by broad strokes of the brush , and the canvas must be kept at a suitable distance in order that their real truth and harmony may become apparent .

		Readers of the photographic sort of current fiction will need to readjust their vision if they would get the proper effect of Mrs.
Catherwood	ORGANIZATION	's subtle impressionism .

		The '' white islander '' is an orphaned French maiden protected by an Indian chief who has planned to make her his wife .

		The
Island of Mackinac	ORGANIZATION	, as it was in the old days before the white man had taken possession of its beauti - ful shores , is the scene of the story , and the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 freshness and fragrance of a primitive world breathes from many a descriptive passage upon the reader 's transported sense .

		A sweet and simple love story is the central theme of the narrative , relieved by venturous episodes and thrilling escapes from peril .

		We fancy that Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's Indians are sometimes shown in too romantic , or at least artificial , a light , but it must be remembered that inter - course with priests and traders had already begun upo : i them the work of sophistication .

		The study of the chief Wawatam , in whose breast barbaric and civilized instincts struggle for the supremacy , is certainly well conceived and finely executed .

		The illustrations of the story , mostly simple figures , are very attractive . ''

		Pastorals of
France	LOCATION	'' and '' Renunciations '' are the titles of two collections of stories by Mr.
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	; the first of them published as long ago as
1877	DATE	, the other during the present year .

		Both collections are now re - published in a single exquisite volume .

		There are but three stories in each set , and the second of the two titles might fitly have been given to the entire volume , for each of the stories is a study of renunciation , imposed either by duty or social conditions ; or , in one case , by nothing more imperative than an over-exacting aesthetic sense .

		In each of the six it is love that is re - nounced , and in the last of them both love and life are yielded up together .

		This last story , with its impressive picture of the two lovers , in the presence of imminent death free at last to declare themselves , is a minor masterpiece upon the theme of Kenan 's famous '' Abbesse de Jouarre . ''

		It is a curious coincidence , by the way , that the last of the stories in Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's volume also touches upon this theme .

		Mr.
Wedmore	PERSON	's three French '' pastorals '' are very subtle of workmanship , and very truthful in their realization of provincial types .

		Their pathos is subdued rather than poignant , but is without trickery or artificiality , and absolutely simple and genuine .

		One may read many vol - umes of the best current fiction without encoun - tering as fine a literary art as Mr.
Wedmore	PERSON	displays in this collection .

		Admirers of Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	will do well to pass by the collection of stories last published .

		They are the veriest pot-boilers , and wholly unworthy of his exceptional talent .

		It is dif - ficult to believe that they are recent work at all ; they rather bear the marks of a prentice hand , and we venture the guess that they have been unearthed from the magazines or story - papers of some years ago .

		They include tales of Australian bush-rangers , Russian nihilists , and South-African diamond hunters , and are crude , extravagant , and sensational .

		The volume of short stories by the author of '' With Fire and Sword , '' translated by Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	, exhibits the remarkable genius of the Polish novelist in a new light .

		Three of them are exquisitely pathetic little sketches ; a fourth ''
Bartek	PERSON	the Victor '' although richly sup - plied with incident , is essentially a psychologi - cal study of the Polish peasant-soldier ; .

		while the fifth , failing sadly in the attempt to be humorous , is yet interesting as a reminiscence of the author 's sojourn in our own American West . ''

		Bartek the Victor '' fills nearly half the volume , and comes near to being a master - piece in its kind .

		The collection of small volumes known as the '' Distaff '' series was designed , we are told , to illustrate the best work done by women of the State of
New York	LOCATION	in contributions to periodical literature .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	has edited a volume of '' Short Stories '' for this series , and the result is , to say the least , disappointing .

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's own story , ''
Monsieur Alcibiade	PERSON	, '' is a gem , and belongs at the beginning rather than at the end of the volume .

		The four stories that precede it do not rise above a low level of mediocrity , although there are flashes of a sort of rude genius in '' My Own Story , '' by Mrs.
R. H. Stoddard	PERSON	.

		Miss
Chesebro	PERSON	,
Miss Crosby	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Slosson	PERSON	are the other
New York	LOCATION	women represented .

		It is a long while since we have had a volume of stories from the author of ''
Marjory Daw	PERSON	, '' and the new collection is very welcome .

		Nor has the pen lost its cunning that so took us unawares at the close of ''
Marjory Daw	PERSON	, '' for '' Two Bites at a Cherry '' ends in quite as amusingly unexpected a fashion , while a mild surprise , at least , awaits the reader of ''
Goli	PERSON	- ath '' and '' My Cousin the Colonel . ''

		Fantastic imaginings , such as few but Mr.
Aldrieh	PERSON	can deal with , are found in '' The Chevalier de Resseguier '' and one other story , while pathos overshadows the two remaining tales .

		We may suggest to Mr.
Aldrieh	PERSON	, a propos of a passage in '' My Cousin the Colonel , '' that it is the dyer 's hand , not his arm , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	informs us is subdued to what it works in .

		We may also question the use of the word `` smelting , '' as applied to the liquefaction of the blood of
St. Januarius	LOCATION	, and possibly criti - cise the preciosity which has transformed a familiar colloquialism into the following state - ment : '' Mrs.
Wesley	PERSON	is a lady that does not 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, allow any species of vegetation to accumulate under her feet . ''

		These be trifles , but Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	is a verbal artist , and his responsibil - ities are greater than most writers have to bear .

		Some of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's phrases are irresistible , such as the soliloquy of the relativeless man : '' I wonder that I was allowed any ancestors : why was n't I created at once out of some stray scrap of protoplasm ? ''

		Or the remark of Dr.
Downs	PERSON	, who is about to cross the seas with the woman whom he hopelessly adores : '' If I am not to have earthly happiness with her , I am at least to have some watery happiness . ''

		Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's humorous touches are never far away , and they are always a delight .

		The short stories of Mr.
James	PERSON	have often been chargeable with a sacrifice of interest to subtlety of analysis .

		The more recent of these stories , while losing nothing in subtlety , have distinctly gained in interest .

		This remark is particularly applicable to the three stories of the collection now at hand .

		In one of them , ''
Owen Wingrave	PERSON	, '' there is actually a myste - rious death , and , although we have more than a suspicion that the murderer was a ghost , it is gratifying to find in a story by Mr.
James	PERSON	anything of so startling a character . ''

		Colla - boration '' seems to us the most highly finished of the three .

		It is an international episode , but this time
Franco	PERSON	- German , instead of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American , and art for art 's sake is its theme .

		That principle has fallen into much discredit of late , mainly through the extravagances of its later devotees , but we can not afford to let it go altogether , and Mr.
James	PERSON	reminds us in his suggestive indirect way , that it is still worthy of at least a limited acceptance . ''

		The Wheel of Time '' is a less striking story than either of the other two , being in the familiar manner of a long series of its predecessors , a manner to which the author is by this time so accus - tomed that production must result from some sort of reflex action rather than from any very energetic exercise of imaginative volition .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		A NEW life of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	has been undertaken by Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	.

		The information brought to me , '' Mr.
Wright	PERSON	boldly says , '' in the form of reminiscences and published notes , etc. , will make a volume that will put
Forster	PERSON	's life a long , long way in the background .

		I shall be able to throw light on the early life of Dickens just before he began to be famous .

		Some curious recol - lections concerning
Dickens	PERSON	' method of work will be embodied in the life , and a chapter will be devoted to the novelist 's humor , as contrasted with the humor of our other great laughter-compellers . ''

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i. Holiday purchasers whose Christmas gifts take the suitable and sensible form of beautiful books need this year find little difficulty in making a se - lection , save , indeed , that arising from an embar - rassment of riches .

		Despite the present commercial depression -LRB- commercial hesitancy is perhaps the better word -RRB- the Holiday output is larger than usual , and the average of merit is higher a fact implying a spirit of enterprise and of public faith on the part of the publishers that should not go un - rewarded .

		`` It 's an ill wind that blows no man good '' ; and we venture to predict -LRB- with an optimism perhaps rather one-sided -RRB- that the `` hard times '' will inure during the Holiday season , in a way , to - the benefit of the bookseller .

		The making of
Christ	LOCATION	- mas presents is nowadays really more a matter of obligation than of choice .

		Not fewer gifts , but less expensive ones , will be in order ; and the bookstore is obviously the best place to lay out a moderate sum to advantage .

		The following list includes mainly the publications received earliest by
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, some important titles being reserved for no - tice in our issue of
December 16	DATE	.

		First on our list comes Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	and
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' sumptuous art-work , `` Masters and Mas - terpieces of Engraving , '' by Mr.
Willis O. Chapin	PERSON	r a work of permanent interest and value , but so obviously suited to the wants of the more critical class of Holiday buyers that we include it in the present category .

		Mr.
Chapin	PERSON	has furnished an intelligent , logically-coherent survey of the main phases of the engraver 's art and of its evolution a happy mingling of history , biography , technical exposition , and criticism and appreciation of lead - ing men and works .

		The subject is popularly , yet soberly and critically , handled .

		The author has aimed to trace for the general reader the history of the art from its beginnings down to our own time , including in his narrative some account of the en - gravers themselves and of their severaLtheories and methods .

		Having discussed in the opening chapter the origin of the art , he proceeds to trace , in suc - cessive chapters , its development , in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	and
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	,
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		The revival of wood-engraving , started by
Bewick	PERSON	in the eighteenth century , is treated in a separate chapter ; and the volume closes with an account of `` Various Modern Engravers , '' including those of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The work is richly illustrated with sixty engravings and heliogravures some of them notable specimens of their class .


Raimondi	PERSON	's `` Lucretia '' -LRB- after
Raphael	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Diirer	PERSON	's `` The Nativ - ity , '' Van
Leyden	PERSON	's ''
David before Saul	PERSON	, ''
Van Dyck	PERSON	's `` Lucas Vosterman , '' are superb plates ; but where merit is so even , it is needless to partic - ularize .

		For the connoisseur fastidious in the arts and refinements of book-manufacture , there is probably nothing on our list likely to prove more attractive
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 than the captivating edition of
Beckford	PERSON	's `` Vathek , '' one hundred and fifty copies of which are issued for
America	LOCATION	by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The vol - ume is a dainty nine-inch octavo , bound in green silk , with an arabesque cover design stamped in gold .

		The text is clearly printed upon the lightest and flakiest of hand-made laid paper ; and there are eight full-page etchings by Mr.
Herbert Nye	PERSON	, which display a facile fancy and good technical skill .

		That the plates do not include a portrait of the author may perhaps be thought a regrettable omission , the more so as the editor , Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, has supplied a rather full notice of Beckf ord .

		` Vathek , '' facile princeps among Oriental tales by English writers , furnishes a fair literary analogue to the famous forensic effort of `` Single-Speech ''
Hamilton	PERSON	a solitary flash of genius from out the obscurity of a generally mediocre career .

		It has long been regarded as a striking exception to the maxim , Nil sine magno Vita labor e dedit mortalibus '' But
Beckford	PERSON	's assertion -LRB- or rather
Redding	PERSON	's ver - sion of it -RRB- , that he wrote the tale in one sitting of three days and two nights , is now disproved on the evidence of
Beckford	PERSON	's own statements in his letters to
Henley	LOCATION	, the original translator and annotator .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	goes into these critical issues very thoroughly in his Introduction .

		As to the literary qualities of `` Vathek '' not much need be said .

		It has held its place for a century , and has made its au - thor famous .

		Byron pronounced it far superior , as an Eastern tale , to '' Rasselas '' ; and Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	thinks it the only modern Oriental story worthy to appear in the '' Arabian Nights , '' with `` Aladdin on its right hand and
Ali Baba	LOCATION	on its left '' which is a pretty high rating .

		Its beauties are not recondite , and inability to enjoy it results from a dislike to its genre , from personal deficiency , in short , from a lack of the mental qualities it presupposes in its readers .

		We have all met the unhappy being who `` can see nothing funny in Pickwick , '' and to the man born deaf the Anvil Chorus remains forever a profound silence .

		A copy of this beautiful edition of `` Vathek '' should please the most critical .

		That ever-green favorite , '' The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table , '' makes its appearance in a neat two-volume edition -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with illustrations by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	as the special feature .

		We are glad to note that Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	has not lowered his work and degraded his author by any concessions to the popular taste for the comic .

		His illustration is not overdone , and it does not savor of caricature .

		In many of the plates one distinguishes the genial features of the `` Autocrat '' himself ; and several of the more fanciful ones , notably '' The Old Vio - lin '' and '' First Love , '' are charmingly conceived .

		There are two capital frontispiece portraits of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Besides the regular edition , which is ele - gant enough for ordinary tastes and purses , the pub - lishers have provided a large-paper edition which is one of the choicest publications of the season .

		Admirers of
Charles Reade	PERSON	's fine novel of '' The Cloister and the Hearth '' will welcome the chastely - elegant two-volume edition of it issued by Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	and
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes are made up in the tasteful French style a rivulet of print in a broad field of margin ; moderately glazed paper , thin and pliant ; with a great number of delicately - toned vignettes -LRB- in treatment nicely poised between the illustrative and the ornamental -RRB- set in the text , or at the head or the foot of the page .

		The artist , Mr.
William Johnson	PERSON	, has done his work with tact , skill , and historical accuracy as to costumes and ac - cessories .

		He has not swamped the dainty text with too-profuse decoration , and he has caught and re - flected the essential temper and spirit of the story .

		Technically , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's drawings call for high praise .

		Some of the figures are really models in precision of line and delicacy of modelling ; while the little groups are full of energy and dramatic force throughout .

		Turning over these tempting pages , we are pleasantly reminded of the time when we first read the story , in the serial form , and with the quaint , strong cuts of the older editions .

		And what a story I decidedly not the finical work of the artist in verbal filigree , who in the end tells us nothing save the tale of his own pretty dexterities , but a romance , rich and full-bodied , strong in plot and swift in ac - tion , a drama of human life and human nature broad and undiluted , as the writers of a less critical and more inventive age loved to tell it .

		We are glad to see our old favorite in so fine a garb .

		In their attractive reprint of
Elizur Wright	PERSON	's trans - lations of `` The Fables of La Fontaine , '' Messrs.
Estes	PERSON	and
Lauriat	PERSON	have made a happy choice of sub - ject for a Holiday book .


Wright	PERSON	's is still , all in all , the best English version of the chief of modern fab - ulists , and it is the only complete one except
Thorn	PERSON	- bury 's , which is to be had only , we believe , in an un - wieldy quarto with
Dora	PERSON	's dubious plates .


Wright	PERSON	's work originally appeared in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1841	DATE	, went through six editions in three years , and then passed out of print .


George Ticknor	PERSON	praised it , and Long - fellow ,
Prescott	PERSON	, Chancellor Kent ,
Bryant	PERSON	, and others , assisted and encouraged the translator in getting it published .

		The sixth edition was slightly expurg - ated , and the expurgator 's self-exculpatory protest in his preface is worth quoting : `` In this age , '' he says , `` distinguished for almost everything more than sincerity , there are some people who would seem too delicate and refined to read their Bibles '' to which reflection we take the liberty of adding the fabulist 's couplet , '' A filthy taint they soonest find Who are to relish filth inclined . ''

		The present edition contains thirteen well-executed etchings by Le Rat , from the designs of
E. Adam	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bindings are extremely chaste and pretty .

		Another pretty book in Messrs.
Estes	PERSON	and
Lau	PERSON	- riat 's creditable list is Mrs.
Clara Erskine Clement	PERSON	's '' The Queen of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	, '' handsomely printed at the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and illustrated with views 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, of
Venice	LOCATION	in photogravure , in the style of the same firm 's `` The Lily of the Arno '' of last year .

		The exceedingly tasteful cover white cloth stamped in blue and gold , with the lion of
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	and fine tracery calls for special notice .

		Mrs.
Erskine	PERSON	's story of mediaeval and modern
Venice	LOCATION	is spirited and graphic , and the book may be commended as a fair complemental volume to Mr.
Horatio M. Brown	PERSON	's philosophical study of the Republic , no - ticed in our issue of
June 16	DATE	.

		A beautiful and seasonable book is `` The Christ - Child in Art '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , a collection of the series of richly illustrated Christmas articles on the child - hood of Christ and its several phases as reflected in mediaeval and modern art , contributed by Mr.
Henry D. Van Dyke	PERSON	to ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The au - thor , by-the-bye , should not be confounded with that competent art-critic
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	, with whose spirit and methods he has little in common .

		Regarding his theme mainly from the literary and emotional standpoint , he sheds over it a flood of pious enthusiasm which is always sincere and some - times eloquent but is not art-criticism .

		We do not mean that Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	is without feeling for the special qualities which artists and artist - critics insist on as the prime qualities ; but he be - longs to the class of art-writers who occasionally read into a picture high-sailing notions which the painter himself -LRB- honest man ! -RRB-

		nine times in ten never dreamed of putting there and appraise it accordingly .

		As a narrative , the work is interest - ing and valuable , and its many beautiful plates after mediaeval and modern masters make it an ac - ceptable gift-book .

		Mr.
F. Hunter Potter	PERSON	's translation of
M. Dau	PERSON	- det 's `` Letters from My Mill '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	PERSON	, and Co. -RRB- is generally satisfactory rather unusually so , we think and the publishers have given it the handsome setting it deserves .

		We need not dwell here upon the charm of these crisp and delicate sketches .

		The '' Lettres '' are gems of French lit - erary art , and in them , to our thinking ,
M. Daudet	PERSON	has touched his high-water mark .

		We are glad to see them made accessible in a respectable English version .

		The colored full-page plates by Mme.
Madeleine Lemaire	PERSON	have a fine decorative effect , and Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	's headpieces are acceptable .

		The etched portrait of
M. Daudet	PERSON	is an admirable plate . ''

		The Century Gallery '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a gener - ously-filled portfolio containing sixty-four selected proofs from `` The Century Magazine , '' is a pro- duction of the pronounced Holiday order and will doubtless make its way .

		Twenty engravers are represented .

		The engravings , each of which is printed on heavy plate paper 13x17 inches , offer great variety of subject and are of very uneven merit .

		Some of them , as Mr.
T. Cole	PERSON	's ''
Madonna	PERSON	and Child , '' after
Boticelli	PERSON	, are clear and strong in line and modelling ; others , as Mr.
Robert Blum	PERSON	's `` A Love Story , '' are somewhat indistinct .

		The ensemble , however , is attractive enough , and most of the names represented are a guaranty for the original quality of the work .

		That `` The Man from
Blankley	PERSON	's '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	`` Punch '' need not deter the wavering American buyer , as the humor of the book is not of the unleavened or Passover brand one looks for in that respectable '' Weekly . ''

		The volume contains a series of dialogue sketches by that delightful and ingenious humorist , Mr.
F. Anstey	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Anstey	PERSON	takes the reader the round of various
London	LOCATION	shops and places of amusement , singles out little groups of shoppers or sight-seers , and sets them to talking with the most delightful results .

		His reproductions of the dialect of Cock - aigne are almost as good as
Dickens 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not less capital than the text are Mr.
Bernard Partridge	PERSON	's drawings .

		Col.
T. A. Dodge	PERSON	's fine volume on the '' Riders of Many Lands '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is already too fa - miliar to our readers generally to need extended comment .

		It embraces a series of descriptive and historical chapters on equestrianism in
America	LOCATION	, and on Arabian , Egyptian , Turkish , and other
Ori	PERSON	- ental riders .

		The text is embellished and illustra - ted by the spirited drawings of Mr.
Frederic Rem	PERSON	- ington , and by photographic plates of Oriental sub - jects .

		We are glad to note that Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's work is tolerably free from what may be called Muybridge effects for which we own to a decided dislike .

		Colonel Dodge is master of his theme , and his book contains many practical suggestions for amateurs ambitious to '' witch the world with noble horsemanship . ''

		Messrs.
Estes	PERSON	and
Lauriat	PERSON	are to be congratulated on their fine edition de Luxe -LRB- limited to five hundred copies -RRB- of ' Ruy Bias . ''

		The work is illustrated with etchings by
Champollion	PERSON	, after the very spir - ited and graceful compositions of
Adrien Moreau	PERSON	.

		Notably good are the little headpieces representing scenes and incidents in the drama .

		The book is , in general make-up , one of the finest on our list , and he will be a very captious person indeed who will not rejoice to find it among his Christmas gifts .

		`` Chinese Nights Entertainments '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a collection of forty brief tales translated by Miss
Adele M. Fielde	ORGANIZATION	from the Swatow vernacular , afford some amazing examples of Oriental skill with the long bow .

		The stories are strung , in Eastern fash - ion , on the thread of a longer romance ; and they were gathered by the translator when '' travelling in a slow native boat , or sitting in a dim native hut , with almond-eyed women and children , in the east - ern corner of the
Kwangtung	LOCATION	province , in
Southern China	LOCATION	. ''

		Their quaint fancies and native flavor give them a decided relish .

		There are some draw - ings by native artists ; and these are surprisingly free from the usual tea-tray effects and general topsy-turveyness of the school .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue '' The Rivals '' in a style generally similar to their '' School for
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 Scandal '' of last year .

		Mr.
Frank M. Gregory	PERSON	again supplies the illustrations five colored full - page aquarelles , and thirty-eight black-and-white text drawings , in several of which he is fairly suc - cessful .

		Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's work shows improvement , but there is a lack of verve in the conception and of finish in the drawing .

		Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	's volume of `` Glimpses of the French Court '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	and
Lauriat	PERSON	-RRB- com - prises a series of sketches from French history ` The Story of
Jean Baptiste	PERSON	, '' `` Turenne , '' `` A Corsair of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Jean Bart -RRB- , etc. .

		The author writes in a brisk , chirping , fairy-tale sort of style , that is at times oddly at variance with the gravity of her topic .

		But the book is wholesome and spir - ited , and it should prove a welcome and useful gift to younger readers .

		There are a number of por - traits , one or two of them exceedingly well done .

		In our
December	DATE	issue of
1890	DATE	we praised a sumptuous edition of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's '' Me - moir of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, '' with etchings by
Percy Moran	PERSON	.

		The publishers ,
Messrs. Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead	PERSON	, and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, now issue , in a new style , a more practical and less expensive edition of the work , in make-up sim - ilar to their pretty '' Eighteenth Century Vignettes '' of last year .

		There are fourteen well-made and well-chosen process-work portraits of celebrities , mainly of Walpolian times .

		Among these we note ''
David Hume	PERSON	, '' a placid , strong face , ''
Lady Montague	PERSON	, '' `` Mrs.
Clive	PERSON	, '' `` Mine , du Deffand '' -LRB- `` old blind debauchee of wit , '' as caustic
Horace	PERSON	styled her -RRB- , `` Thomas Gray , '' `` Lady
Walpole	LOCATION	, '' `` Hannah More '' the dainty Quakeress of whose charms the great
Johnson	PERSON	was once slyly mindful as
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	tells us ; and , lastly , the volatile virtuoso of Strawberry Hill himself , whose likeness rather bears out
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's conception of his character .

		There is an appended list of books printed at the
Strawberry Hill Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have already praised Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's sprightly anecdotal '' Memoir , '' which was originally issued , we believe , by its present pub - lishers .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' elaborate `` Van Twiller '' edition of Irving 's '' Knickerbocker 's His - tory of
New York	LOCATION	'' follows in most points its pro- totypes , the ''
Darro	PERSON	'' edition of '' The
Alhambra	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1891 -RRB- , and the `` Agapida '' edition of `` The Con - quest of Granada '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- .

		In the present work the decorative page-border is of a paler tone , and , in the plates , for the sun 's pencil is substituted that of Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Kemble	PERSON	's designs are irre - sistibly funny not over-refined or over-artistic , cer - tainly , but bubbling over with humor .

		He has drawn Irving 's many-breeched , cabbage-loving -LRB- and cab - bage-headed -RRB- Dutchmen to the life though without much regard for the ancestral pride of their des - cendants numbered among Mr.
MacAllister	PERSON	's 400 Brahmans .

		The '' Van Twiller '' edition is finely printed and richly bound , and it should repeat the success of its predecessors .

		`` A Norse Romance '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a thin quarto of the familiar Holiday type , containing a brief poem , with crayon di'awings , by Mrs. 0 .

		M. Spof - ford .

		The quality of Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's verse may be indicated in the following selection : '' Like winged beasts the waters rise , Or sink with sullen roar ; From deep green depths the lurid eyes Of monsters seem to tower . ''

		Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's drawings are rather better than her verses .

		Considering the modest price asked for it , Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's two-volume edition of Car - lyle 's '' History of the French Revolution '' is a very satisfactory one .

		The print is new and bright , the paper fairly good , and the volumes -LRB- respectively 361 and 435 pp . -RRB-

		are desirably compact .

		Carlyle 's `` History '' is still unapproached for the dramatic splendor of its narrative , the vigor of its portrait - ure , and the vivid impression it leaves upon the mind of the reader .

		There are few books of which one retains more that is worth retaining , without special effort .

		The portraits , where they are well verified , add much to the pictorial force of the nar - rative .

		A striking and unique book externally is `` The Old Garden , and Other Verses '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Margaret Deland	PERSON	.

		The text is printed in black - letter , and each page is showily decorated in mis - sal style and colors by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	.

		As a novelty the book is very well , but Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	's graceful verses do not seem to call for a setting quite so '' unprofitably gay . ''

		Viewed away from the ensemble , Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's designs are attractive enough .

		Readers for whom seventy pages of unbroken Negro dialect have no terrors will look with favor upon the tasty volume containing Mr.
Thomas Nel	PERSON	- son Page 's familiar story '' Meh Lady '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with Mr.
C. S. Reinhart	PERSON	's familiar plates .

		The book is nicely and modestly bound , and will doubtless find friends .

		A tasteful booklet is
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' The Hang - ing of the
Crane	PERSON	, and Other Poems of the Home '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Paper , binding , and typography con - sidered , the little volume is an almost flawless piece of book-making , while the eight process cuts serve their modest purpose .

		The poems , ten in number , are selected on the principle indicated in the title , and the cii ` cumstances under which Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	wrote them are given in the appended notes .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin and Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of Miss S. 0 .

		Jewett 's ''
Deephaven	ORGANIZATION	, '' with its all too-shiny paper and its -LRB- to our thinking -RRB- rather crudely-conceived cover , is scarcely recognizable as `` a Houghton '' publication .

		The best part of the book barring , of course , the story , which is charm - ing is the illustration by
Charles	PERSON	and
Maria Wood	ORGANIZATION	- bury .

		Some of
Miss Woodbury	LOCATION	's Yankee types , notably '' Mrs.
Dockum	PERSON	, '' ''
Skipper Scudder	PERSON	, '' and the bucolic group surrounding a circus elephant , are capitally drawn .

		The continuedjlpopularity -LSB- of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's 348 -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, strong novel , ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' is evinced by the several new editions of it issued this
Autumn	DATE	.

		Among them is one , from Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in two volumes , with illustrative drawings by Mr.
F. T. Merrill	PERSON	, that , its very moderate price considered , will be hard to match .

		Messrs.
Estes	PERSON	and
Lauriat	PERSON	have made
William Ware	PERSON	's '' Aurelian , Emperor of
Rome	LOCATION	'' a tale of the Empire in the
third century	DATE	the basis of a rather attractive gift-book .

		It is well printed at the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and contains twenty full-page plates , mostly photographic , of Roman views , art - works , portraits , etc. .

		The cover , white and red with gilt tracery and stamped medallion , is very ornate .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead	ORGANIZATION	, and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	have made a pretty book of Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	's old
New York	LOCATION	romance , '' The Bow of Orange Ribbon . ''

		The text is well printed on highly-glazed paper , and the large colored plates and fancifully disposed vignettes have a pleasing effect .

		The artist is Mr.
Theodore Hampe	PERSON	.

		BOOKS FOR THE YOTJNG .

		I .

		The best of the books for the young are those which tell a dramatic historical tale vividly , describe pictur - esquely and truthfully the life of foreign countries or the heroes of our own , or appeal to the imagination through fairies , folk-lore , or heroic deeds .

		There are some of these among the publications of this season , but they are not numerous .

		Most of them follow the gen - eral run of stories for boys .

		We find such familiar names among the writers as those of Messrs.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	,
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	,
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	, and
Oliver Optic	PERSON	, all of whom write vigorous , healthful stories of advent - ure , very good of their kind .

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butter	PERSON	- worth and Col.
Thomas W. Kuox	PERSON	send their customary books of travel , and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	, Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	, and
Ouida	PERSON	have each something to offer us .

		The notable novelties are few .

		The Century Com - pany 's '' World 's Fair Book , '' with its excellent illustra - tions from photographs and from
Castaigne	ORGANIZATION	's beautiful drawings , will be deservedly popular ; and Mr.
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	's tales of his '' Dark Companions '' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- will doubtless have a wide circulation .

		Mrs.
Seelye	PERSON	follows up her last year 's '' Story of
Columbus	LOCATION	'' with a `` Story of
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which , in spite of our ill-directed familiarity with that stately figure , is badly needed .

		The discoverers are considered in Mr.
F. Gordon Stables	PERSON	's `` Westward with
Columbus	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- and Mrs.
Bolton	PERSON	's '' Famous Voyagers and Explor - ers '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- ; and there are one or two books of nat - ural history .

		Of the story books , besides those already mentioned , Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	publishes one for girls and Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	another for boys .

		Blanche
Willis	PERSON	How - ard has also joined the ranks ; but Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's auto - biographical study , '' The One I Knew the Best of All '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , takes the place of her usual volume of tales .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's True Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , from which much was expected , is rather disappointing .

		Artistically , this season 's crop is rather below the average of former years .

		But one ingenious volume , `` Topsys and Turvys '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will certainly make a sensation among the little people .

		The draw - ings , of which the book is made up , are the work of Mr.
P. S. Newell	PERSON	; and so cleverly are they designed , that one may turn the picture upside down and find , from that point of view , that its lines make a totally different picture , furnishing the sequel to the story told by the first .

		This kind of puzzle is attractive to chil - dren , and to the child in each of us , and the artist is so ingenious and has so large a fund of humor at his dis - posal that the book is very diverting .

		He has , too , a sense of color , so that his pictures are generally decor - ative Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	Cox issues the third of his popular Brownie books , this time '' The Brownies at Home '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It seems to belie its name , however , or to prove the cosmopolitanism of these midgets , for the author describes their wanderings through the South ,
Washington	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and the World 's Fair .

		The latter episode is badly treated , however , and the draw - ings illustrating it are not only inaccurate , but inartistic , which is much worse .

		The Brownies themselves , though , are amusing , and their comical expressions and costumes will serve to entertain many idle half hours .

		In '' The Musical Journey of
Dorothy	PERSON	and Delia '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , also , the drawings are more important than the text , although the story is bright and original .

		It is written by Mr.
Bradley Gilman	PERSON	to enliven the tasks of plodding little musicians , and it may easily serve to give an imagina - tive lift in the mind of the student to the dry ranks of notes in the music-book .

		The frolics of the naughty notes described here would give them a new character to a child , endow them with life and animation enough to make them interesting .

		The drawings by Mr.
F. E. Attwood	PERSON	, which illustrate the book , are thoroughly charming and give a fascinating individuality to the wayward notes and puzzling musical terms With these may also be mentioned , because of its cleverly-drawn illustrations , '' The History of a Bearskin '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	ORGANIZATION	, and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is from the French of M. Jules de Mar - thold , but its illustrations , by
J. O. B.	PERSON	, are not trans - lated ; they are French to the core , gay , dashing , orig - inal , and delightfully humorous .

		There are quantities of them scattered through the text , and not one is with - out character .

		The story itself is a fit accompaniment to these drawings .

		A French peasant , who by luck , rather than merit or ambition , became a grenadier dur - ing the Napoleonic wars , is the hero , and his naive self - assurance , together with a kind of bravado in his cow - ardice , are very entertaining .

		The story sparkles with wit , and its presentation of peasant types is extremely clever , though rather too sophisticated , perhaps , for young readers .

		One of the most notable books of the season contin - ues the series of fairy tales which have been published from year to year by Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, the editor of `` Folk-Lore . ''

		The present book is called `` More En - glish Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , being the second collection which this indefatigable scholar has gathered from En - glish sources .

		They are excellent stories , admirably told .

		They all seem to come direct from the people , so straightforward are they in thought , so clear and dra - matic in plot and construction , and so simple and forci - ble in style .

		The editor 's work has been done extremely well , and the result is a collection of tales fascinating to children of all ages .

		Several old favorites are among them : the
Pied Piper	ORGANIZATION	in an English setting , the
Three Bears	ORGANIZATION	, the Children in the Wood , and others ; but most of the tales are new to our ears , and all of them have the delicious fragrance of the soil .

		Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	's work
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 in collecting these tales is invaluable and deserves our special gratitude .

		The book is illustrated by Mr.
John D. Batten	PERSON	, whose drawings are original and very artistic ; he has the true decorative touch , and this , with his hu - mor , makes his designs an education to children and a rare pleasure to their elders .

		Of very different calibre is the other volume of fairy-tales in this year 's collec - tion .

		`` The Chronicles of Fairyland '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Fergus Hume	PERSON	, are such fantastic tales as the most limited imagination could evolve .

		They are goody - goody stories , too , in which the moral strikes one in the face ; but the ideal of honor which they create is not al - ways of the highest .

		When one is shown the misery to be produced by sin and the happiness gained in renounc - ing it , it is easy enoiigh to choose the right course , like the little crossing-sweeper in one of these stories ; but the lesson to be gained from this , that material rewards always accompany virtvie , is of questionable beneficence . ''

		Melody , the Story of a Child '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- will doubt - less be very successful , if for no other reason than be - cause it is written by Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, the au - thor of '' Captain
January	DATE	. ''

		It is a sweet and simple story of a blind girl , who is gifted with a remarkable voice .

		The adopted child of two maiden ladies in a little
New England	LOCATION	village , she is stolen from them by an ambitious musician ; and the tale of her unhappiness , ending finally in a joyous return to her home , is prettily told .

		The subordinate characters are well handled and have much individuality ; and in the little heroine , Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	has really created a starry soul .

		A very dif - ferent kind of hero is represented in the little book for boys which
Miss Blanche Willis Howard	ORGANIZATION	has just pub - lished ; a much more practical , every-day type , but one thoroughly boyish and genuine and fine .

		The title of the book , '' No Heroes '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , is given in allu - sion to
Bob	PERSON	's lament that he was not born in the olden time , when there were knights and ladies , and a man could be a hero .

		The story of his own unconsciously heroic sacrifice , which follows , is told in a straightfor - ward , vigorous way which will appeal to boys and girls .

		It has the touch of strong feeling in it , without losing in the least its masculinity .

		Louisa de la Rame '' -LRB-
Ouida	PERSON	-RRB- is less successful in her work for children this year than last , when she published some charming fancies . ''

		A Dog of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- contains four tales which are rather old and rather melancholy for the cheery temperaments of children .

		Each one of them has a tragic end , and enough of the bitterness of life to give a distinctly morbid tone .

		This is hardly mitigated by the fine and noble characters , for they are so invariably unhappy that the effect of the tales is doleful . ''

		A Leaf in the Storm '' is the most inspiring of them , with its fearful picture of the brutality and the heroism voked by the Franco-Prussian war .

		But the last one should never have been included in a book for children , so sophisticated is it in plot and emotion .

		A vigorous , healthful story comes this year from Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	.

		It is called `` Six Boys '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , though one of the set is a girl , and describes their adventures through the complications resulting from an attempt at robbery .

		Suspicion is thrown upon the one who is afterwards shown to be the bravest and manliest of them all ; and though the misunderstandings are finally straightened out , they are exciting enough in the telling .

		The style is brisk and vivacious , and there is neither coarseness nor sentimentality in the natural boy-life presented .

		The conception of '' The True Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, was an admirable one , for no more fascinating stories of adventure could possibly be devised than some which have been enacted in this work-a-day world .

		This volume takes the place of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's annual fairy book , and relates strange episodes from the lives of Prince
Charlie	PERSON	,
Grace Dar	ORGANIZATION	- ling ,
Benvenuto -LRB- Bellini	PERSON	,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Baron Trenck	PERSON	,
CaBsar Borgia	ORGANIZATION	,
Corte	ORGANIZATION	's , and many another scapegrace and hero .

		The stories are fine , but the book is something of a dis - appointment , because they are not simple enough in style , nor direct and forcible enough in arrangement .

		They are not well focused , in short , a defect which might have been obviated by the suppression of some details and the accenting of certain others .

		They remind one of Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	's lament that life is not artistic .

		Nevertheless , to boys of about fifteen these tales will give stirring matter for reflection In '' The One I Knew the Best of All '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , ` Mrs.
Frances Hodg	PERSON	- son
Burnett	PERSON	has related in the most delicate and charm - ing way her memories of her own childish impressions .

		It is really a valuable record of the development of a child 's mind which she has produced , and the pictures of her successive mental struggles in adjusting herself to the forms and conventionalities of the world are vivid and enlightening .

		The book , however , is rather for the mothers of boys and girls than for the children them - selves , for it is a study of mental processes and impres - sions which may increase their understanding of childish fancies and broaden their sympathy with them .

		That the boys and girls of to-day should lack histor - ical knowledge seems very far from the desire of those who write for the young , if one may judge from the outpouring of books having their foundation in fact .

		It is perhaps a fortunate thing that the books having such a foundation are usually superior in literary merit to those that are purely fiction .

		One of the most deserv - edly popular of these writers of historical fiction is Mr.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	, who this year sends three new volumes to delight his youthful admirers .

		One of these , `` St.
Bartholomew	PERSON	's Eve '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is an exciting tale of the adventures of a young English lad who goes to
France	LOCATION	and engages with his relatives in the Huguenot wars .

		His mother is a French-Huguenot fugitive to
England	LOCATION	, and it is for her sake that he casts his .

		lot with the persecuted French Protestants .

		His experi - ences bring him into relations of intimacy with the frank and kindly young
King of Niavarre	ORGANIZATION	, and the book closes with the terrible scene which gives it its name .

		There is a good spicing of romance with it all , for the young hero saves the life of a fair young French - woman , and in the end we hear the echo of the wed - ding-bells . ''

		Through the Sikh War '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , from the same pen , deals with the problems that confronted the English in the conquest of
India	LOCATION	.

		It has about it the fascinating atmosphere of that land of fable , of Oriental magnificence , of turbaued rajahs and dusky servants .

		It gives a very spirited account not only of the daring exploits of its boy-hero ,
Percy Groves	PERSON	, but of the intrigue and assassination , the play and counter-play , which characterize the strategic warfare of
India	LOCATION	.

		In `` A Jacobite Exile '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Henty	PERSON	has built upon the foundation offered by the life of an English boy in the service of
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		of
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		With his father and friends he is unjustly exiled for his fondness for the Stuarts , and in the course of the years thus spent has many thrilling adventures .

		His meetings with
Peter the Great	PERSON	, while unconscious of the latter 's identity , are very entertaining , and give a 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, graphic picture of that monumental character .

		If one were disposed to criticise Mr.
Henty	PERSON	's work , it might be said that his heroes bear a decided , family resem - blance , in other words , they are not very sharply individualized ; but the type of boyhood he chooses is such a manly one that there is little room for complaint .

		The style is clear and forceful , and the atmosphere pure and bracing .

		The illustrations of these three vol - umes are usually good . ''

		The Boys of Greenway Court '' -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- , from the pen of Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	, is a rambling story with an
Indian Summer	ORGANIZATION	atmosphere about it .

		The characters of
Washington	LOCATION	and the young friends who were wont to gather with him at
Greenway Court	ORGANIZATION	, the home of Lord
Fairfax	LOCATION	, are sketched with few lines .

		A very pleasant picture is this of the old Virginian lord , stern but kindly , living in the midst of his vast estates , and , while devoutly loyal to the king , unconsciously moulding the characters of these young men who in after years set that same king at defiance .

		The hero is a lad by the name of
Harry Meudell	PERSON	, whose faithful - ness to the injunction '' Be true to the best that is in you '' proves a source of sufficient trouble to make a thread of romance about which to weave the truth .

		Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	chooses to make but few moral points , but they are so well made that they are likely to stick in the memory .

		The chief drawback to a thorough enjoy - ment of his work , however , is the very jerky character of the style .

		The
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	seems to offer unlimited possibilities for thrilling stories ; and it is this field which Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	enters twice this year . ''

		Guert Ten Eyck '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a stirring narrative of pre-Revolutionary times in
New York	LOCATION	, the story ending with the execution of
Nathan Hale	PERSON	.

		The hero ,
Guert Ten Eyck	PERSON	, is a thoroughly enterprising and wide-awake Yankee boy , in spite of his Dutch ancestry .

		He enters , heart and soul , into the feelings of his elders , and very materially assists the cause of freedom by his work as messenger and scout .

		Two very picturesque characters are introduced : an old slave , and a
Manhattan	LOCATION	Indian who is the last of his race , and who assists in the attempt to expel the English because in the simplicity of his heart he believes the island will be his when they are gone .

		Young
Aaron Burr	PERSON	and
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	figure prominently .

		The writer catches the true spirit of those exciting times , and never allows the interest to flag .

		It is a sadder though no less truthful side of the same struggle which is given by the same writer in '' On the Old Frontier '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		This work depicts the last raid of the Iroquois upon a little fort in
Western New York	LOCATION	.

		The type of character that held its own against these Indian raids , and pushed forward , fighting at every step , to lay the foundations of a great state , is finely drawn .

		The book is one which will give some of our boys a new idea of what privation means , and teach them to honor the memory of those pioneers whose stead - fast courage made their present comfort possible .

		The illustrations of Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's books leave much to be desired .

		It is with a different period of history , and one not so often treated in books for boys , that Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	deals in `` The White Conquerors '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		This story is free from sensationalism , and gives a straight - forward but exciting account of the conquest of the wonderful Aztec Empire by
Cortez	PERSON	and his handful of Spanish followers .

		The central figure is not the white leader , but a young Toltec , Huetzin by name , who be - longs to the earlier race driven out by the Aztecs .

		His hatred of that race and of their religion is as great as that of the white men .

		The symbol of the Toltec reli - gion is , curiously enough , the cross , and this forms a bond of union between them and the foreigners .

		There are picturesque descriptions of scenery and of life among the natives , and accounts of battles and stratagems full of fire and dash . ''

		The Story of
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , written by Mrs.
Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye	PERSON	and edited by Dr.
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	, is a book that should be welcomed with delight by all who have the best interests of young Americans at heart .

		As in '' The Story of
Columbus	LOCATION	, '' which appeared last year , the author has striven to strip away the glamour of romance thrown around the hero by a doting generation , and let him stand before the world as a man and not as the godlike being of tra - dition .

		He loses not a whit by the operation ; in fact , he is the gainer .

		Mrs.
Seelye	PERSON	has striven to give all the more interesting facts of the period of which Wash - ington is the central figure , and to give them in an entertaining style that , is not lacking in energy and spirit when occasion offers .

		The volume is prettily bound , and is profusely illustrated by Miss
Allegra Eggleston	PERSON	, whose drawings from old pictures , with charming sketches of scenery , add much to its beauty .

		Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	offers this year '' The River and Wilderness Series '' -LRB-
Price-McGill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , three volumes entitled , respectively , '' The River Fugitives , '' '' The Wilderness Fugitives , '' and '' Lena-Wiugo , the Mo - hawk . ''

		The volumes form a narrative of the advent - ures of three young people in escaping from the English and Indians , after the
Wyoming Massacre	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	certainly shows ingenuity in his plot , and cleverness in carrying it out ; yet we can not but feel that the basis of the narrative -LRB- the attempt of the brutal commander of the English forces , Colonel
Butler	PERSON	, to capture the pretty sister of one of the boys , and their efforts to compass her escape -RRB- is hardly a suitable subject for a young mind to dwell upon .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	also completes his '' Wild Wood Series '' -LRB-
Porter	PERSON	and
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- with a volume entitled '' Across
Texas	LOCATION	, '' a spirited account of the dangers and excitements incident to a journey on horseback across
Texas	LOCATION	and
New Mexico	LOCATION	. ''

		Oliver Optic '' adds to his '' Blue and Gray Series '' -LRB- Lee and
Shepard	PERSON	-RRB- a volume entitled '' A Victorious Union . ''

		The works of this veteran writer are so dear to the heart of every American boy that they need no introduction .

		The present one is endowed with the same spirit and enthusiasm that characterized its pred - ecessors , and is certain of its welcome , as is the new volume in his '' All Over the World Series , '' entitled '' American Boys Afloat , '' issued by the same publishers .

		That constant favorite with boys , Colonel
T. W. Knox	PERSON	, makes his customary annual contribution to his '' Boy Travellers '' series -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , this time taking his young excursionists through
Southern Europe	LOCATION	.

		As in the pre - vious volumes , the descriptions are given with painstak - ing care , and the narrative is full of historical allusions .

		The illustrations are both very numerous and very good .

		A little late to be in the flood-tide of popularity comes another story of
Columbus	LOCATION	and the discovery of Amer - ica , '' Diccon the Bold '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Mr.
John Russell Coryell	PERSON	.

		Yet , though late , it will be found entertaining .

		The hero is a blundering , heedless lad , whose warm heart and sturdy frankness prove the means of getting him into many difficulties , but also are the means of gaining him many warm friends , among whom is the
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 great explorer .

		Besides accompanying
Columbus	LOCATION	on his first and most famous voyage ,
Diccon	ORGANIZATION	joins the Cabots in many of their expeditions , which are enter - tainingly described .

		As the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	furnished the great attraction of the year to travellers and sight-seers , it has naturally furnished also the material for what is likely to prove the most attractive juvenile book of the season . ''

		The Century World 's Fair Book for Boys and Girls , '' prepared by Mr.
Tudor Jenks	PERSON	and published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a clever idea cleverly executed .

		The two lively boys who visit the Fair with their tutor seem to permit very little to escape their vision .

		They hunt out all the more interesting exhibits , visit the mar - vels of the
Plaisance	PERSON	, laugh over the remarks of unso - phisticated fellow-visitors , make pencil sketches and take '' snap-shots '' of things which interest them .

		Be - sides these rough sketches , there are many fine photo - graphic views , and some exquisitely poetic drawings by Mr.
Castaigne	PERSON	, several of which have already appeared in '' The Century . ''

		The book will be a delight to the children who had the good fortune to see the glories of the
White City	LOCATION	; while to those who had not , it will be a never-ending source of pleasure and profit .

		NEW YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Nov. 23 , 1893	DATE	.

		The opening of the new Institute for the employees of the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	has again drawn attention to the concentration of the management of this ancient organ - ization , in all its branches , into the hands of persons di - rectly responsible to
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		All its affairs are now controlled by a board of delegates or trustees , by whom a managing secretary is employed to conduct the Press and to supervise its publications in all the stages of manufacture .

		The books , when completed , are put into the hands of a publisher acting as agent for the Press , who manages their sale .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, is now agent for
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who preceded him in that capacity , still retain , through their
New York	LOCATION	house , the Amer - ican agency .

		These facts are of interest in connection with an agitation in behalf of a proposed similar Press , which has been going on in this city for the
last two years	DATE	, or practically since the new movement toward a broader educational basis began at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The teaching force of this
University	ORGANIZATION	has increased to nearly two hundred and fifty members , who publish in the course of the year upward of a thousand books , pamphlets , and articles , in the various departments of creative and technical literature .

		The number of stu - dents and alumni who are doing effective work along the same lines is also rapidly growing larger .

		Hence it has seemed necessary to provide an organization for the publication of the best of this material under the supervision of officers of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Last
summer	DATE	the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	was quietly incorporated at
Albany	LOCATION	, under the '' club act , '' for '' economic , his - toric , and literary purposes . ''

		The president of
Colum	PERSON	-
bia College	ORGANIZATION	is , ex-officio , president of the board of trus - tees of the Press , and the nine trustees are , presumably , gentlemen connected with the
University	ORGANIZATION	, which has au - thorized the formation of the new corporation , although assuming no financial risks in its behalf .

		Besides Pres - ident Low , the first board of management is composed of
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, dean of the faculty of philoso - phy , secretary ;
Francis B. Crocker	PERSON	, professor of electrical engineering ;
George M.	PERSON	dimming , professor of law , treasurer ;
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, professor of literature ;
Richmond Mayo-Smith	PERSON	, professor of political economy ;
Henry F. Osborn	PERSON	, professor of biology ;
H. Thurston Peck	PERSON	, professor of Latin ;
T. Mitchell Prudden	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	; and Mr.
John B. Pine	PERSON	, a trustee of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will thus be seen that the several faculties and the trustees have each a representative in the Press board .

		An executive com - mittee for the transaction of routine business will be composed of the officers .

		The board will move with great conservatism at first , and does not expect its plans to reach a full degree of development for several years .

		It will , I understand , assume financial responsibility for its ventures , and will invite subscriptions and bequests to this end .

		Its present aim is to associate with itself some reputable publishing firm who will manage its sales and perhaps conduct its manufacturing depart - ment .

		Important technical works , which would not pay expenses if published in the ordinary way , will be un - dertaken , and the numerous periodicals edited wholly or in part by the teaching staff of the
University	ORGANIZATION	may be invited to issue from the Press .

		The Press has adopted for its imprint the words ''
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' Uni - versity Press '' displayed on either side , surmounted by a representation of the iron crown presented to
Colum	PERSON	- bia -LRB- then Kings -RRB- College by
George III.	PERSON	, and , under - neath , the legend '' in litteris libertas . ''

		Above and be - low the word `` Columbia '' are the figures
1754	DATE	and
1893	DATE	, the dates of the founding of the
College	ORGANIZATION	and of the Press respectively .

		The season for lectures is now well under way .

		Prob - ably the most interesting announcement of the kind yet made is that Prof.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	will de - liver a series of lectures on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	before the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION
this winter	DATE	, which , I am told , will be the third course given on the
Percy Turnbull	PERSON	poetry foundation .

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's course , delivered last sea - son , has just been published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mif	LOCATION	- flin
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	as '' The Growth and Influence of Classical Greek Poetry , '' and it seems likely that these yearly courses of lectures on poetry will be regularly printed by the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, as suggested by the first lecturer a year or more ago .

		Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	, whose in - activity in a literary way has been so much regretted of late years , will give readings in various cities of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	during
December	DATE	, from a new and impub - lished novel , and it may be taken for granted that the book itself will be in the hands of his readers before the end of
1894	DATE	.

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	has just com - pleted a course of seven lectures at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	on '' The Westward Growth of the
United States	LOCATION	during the Rev - olutionary War , '' but this formidable title does not con - vey any idea of the entertaining manner in which Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	mingles history and frontier '' yarns '' to the edification of a crowded lecture-room of students .

		Mrs.
S. J. Higginson	PERSON	's '' A Princess of
Java	LOCATION	, '' pub - lished five or six years ago , was remarkable for its combination of a most interesting story with attractive pictures of native life in the equatorial island where her husband was
United States	LOCATION	consul for a considerable period .

		Mrs.
Higginson	PERSON	is now living in
New York	LOCATION	, and has lately been occupied with the writing of a new novel , '' A Bedouin Girl , '' which Messrs.
J. Selwin Tait	PERSON	& Sons are about to publish .

		The author has made use of personal observation in the case of this book also , having made the Haj or Holy Pilgrimage .

		The same firm will publish early in
December	DATE	a new novel by 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	-LRB- ''
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' -RRB- with the title , '' A Bundle of Life . ''

		Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's previous novels have been the most successful of the new '' Pseudonym Series . ''

		Their author is an American by birth , although a resident of
London	LOCATION	.

		A widely circulated report that Mr.
Samuel L. Clem	PERSON	- ens has retired from the publishing firm of
Messrs. Charles L. Webster & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is authoritatively denied .

		It may be stated that this firm has disposed of its sub - scription business to another house , in order to enter more actively into trade publication .

		The announcement of Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	's new poetic romance and a well-considered critique of the poet 's writings reached me at the same time .

		The latter was the final essay of a series on '' Living American Writers , '' written by Mr.
Henry C. Vedder	PERSON	of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	'' Examiner '' for that paper .

		These essays have attracted considerable attention here for their able treatment and classification of the leading American authors of the period .

		They will be published in book form next year .

		In his critique of Mr.
Miller	PERSON	, Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	does not hesitate to say that the poet 's early transatlantic success was founded on British insularity and ignorance of the real literary significance of his writings .

		The critic considers Mr.
Miller	PERSON	at his best in his lyrics , and concludes by saying : `` Certain per - sonal eccentricities have also stood between him and a just appreciation of his work .

		There is so much that is finely imaginative in his verse , so much that is genuine in feeling and powerful in expression , that , in spite of his maddening shortcomings , the perverse wil - f ulness of his errors , he deserves , and should before this have been awarded by general suffrage , an honored place well up on the roll of American poets . ''

		IiITERARY 2STOTES AXD MlSCELLAXY .

		Prof.
R. T. Ely	PERSON	's '' Taxation in
American States	LOCATION	and Cities '' has been translated into the Japanese language .

		Professor
Ernst Curtius	PERSON	is to publish his miscellaneous essays and monographs under the title of '' Gesammelte Abhandlungen . ''

		It is announced that a French publishing house is about to start , in
January	DATE	probably , a rival to the '' Revue des Deux Moudes , '' which is supposed to have somewhat lost favor in
France	LOCATION	of late under the editor - ship of the younger Buloz .

		Messrs.
Charles L. Webster & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, write to us denying the rumor that they intend to retire from the book-publishing business .

		The rumor seems to have started from the fact that they have re - cently disposed of the subscription department of their business .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, the author of '' Dodo , '' was educated at
Marlborough	LOCATION	and
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where he gained a scholarship which enabled him to spend a large portion of his time in
Greece	LOCATION	, where he is engaged in archaeological work .

		For some time past he has been engaged in digging up
Megalopolis	LOCATION	, the ancient capital of
Arcadia	LOCATION	.

		The posthumous volume of
Emerson	LOCATION	's works , '' Nat - ural History of the Intellect and Other Papers , '' includ - ing also a General Index to
Emerson 's Collected Works	ORGANIZATION	, is issued by its publishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in both the ordinary and the large-paper editions .

		Sul > - scribers to the latter may obtain the new volume uni - form with the sets already in their possession . ''

		From the time when he became in a manner a dom - iciled Englishman , his improvement was quite astonish - ing , '' is the amiable comment of the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' npon Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, in an article upon the recently pub - lished '' Letters . ''

		This instance of '' condescension '' would have been so keenly relished by its subject that it is a pity he could not have lived to witness it .

		The following anecdote of the late Professor
Jowett	PERSON	appears in an English journal .

		A somewhat pretentious youth was enlarging in the master 's presence on '' Our Debt to
France	LOCATION	. ''

		To
France	LOCATION	we owe our art , the best of our literature , etc. '' Do you know , '' said
Jowett	PERSON	, '' what is inscribed over the gate of hell ? ''

		The youth quoted
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's well-known line . ''

		No , '' was the reply . ''

		The inscription is , ' Id on parle Franfais . ' ''

		Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Me.	LOCATION	, announces for early publication '' Songs of Adieu , '' a collection of recent English lyrics compiled mainly from inaccessible sources ; and '' Old World Lyrics , '' a collection of translations from
Villon	LOCATION	, Du Bellay ,
Ronsard	PERSON	, and other French lyrists .

		These little books are printed from type on Van Gelder handmade paper , and are modelled on an old-style format calculated to appeal to book - lovers .

		These books , like others previously issued by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	, will not be reprinted .

		The ceremonies attending the unveiling of a memorial to
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	in the
Chapter House	ORGANIZATION	of West - minster Abbey were held
November 28	DATE	the memorial consisting of two stained-glass windows , one of them containing a portrait of the poet .

		A distinguished com - pany was present , comprising many of the foremost men in English literature and public life .

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, as Chairman of the
Memorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	, said in his address that the committee had received many offers from the
United States	LOCATION	regarding the memorial , but it had been thought fit to decline them because they wished to show that Englishmen themselves knew how to honor a great American in the spirit in which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	spoke and wrote .

		`` The reason we have met here to honor
Lowell	PERSON	is suggested to any one visiting the Poets ' Corner .

		The long line of illustrious men whose monu - ments are there and who passed the torch of literature from
Chaucer to Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	would doubtless recognize
Lowell	PERSON	as a congenial disciple .

		Scarcely ~ one of these followed letters with more unflagging zeal .

		On him fell the spirit of the great masters . ''

		TRIBUTES TO
EDWIN BOOTH	PERSON	.

		The exercises in memory of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, arranged by the
Players ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, in
New York City	LOCATION	,
November 13	DATE	, included notable tributes from distinguished fellow - actors , among them
Signor Salvini	PERSON	, Mr.
Irving	PERSON	, and Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	.


Signor Salvini	PERSON	said in part : '' Among the sweetest pleasures of my dramatic career none is more sweet than this , that I have enjoyed fra - ternal relations with actors of a different tongue , and highest of all I count and boast the satisfaction of hav - ing been the companion , even for a brief period , of Ed - win Booth .

		In this time of happy recollection , the esteem which I had long cherished for him became established , and I had opportunity to observe that while genius attended him as an artist , refinement , culture , delicacy , and right feeling were never absent from him as a man .

		With good reason he enjoyed the love of his fellow-citizens , and confided in the sympathy and
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL respect of his comrades on the stage , to whom he was a miracle of good counsel , of masterly teaching , and of liberality ; to whom he dedicated the
Players ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, as a conspicuous proof of his enduring affection for his art and for his interpreters . ''

		Prof.
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	read an elegy composed for the occasion , from which we make a brief extract : '' tender soul of human melancholy That o'er him brooded like the firmament !

		Thence had his eyes their supernatural fires And his deep soul its element of
night	TIME	; Thence had he felt the touch of great thoughts wholly That with mortality but ill consent , The star-crost spirit 's unconfined desires , That in this brief breath plumes its fiery flight ; And on his brows hung ever the pale might Of intellectual passion , inward bent , Musing the bounds of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's continent , In that great shadow where the mind aspires , With flashes beautiful and eloquent ; There love , that flies abreast with thoughts of youth , And glides , a splendor , by the wings of truth , Over the luminous vague to darkness went , Like some slow-dying star down heaven 's pole , It moves o'er earth 's blind frame and man 's dark soul And passes out of sight , And the lone soul once more inurns its light .

		So in his blood the poet 's passion wrought , His nature from within dark influence lent , While with his body , there , the spirit blent , And stamped the changeling of creative thought The soul incarnate in its mortal bloom , The infinite , shut in how little room The word , the act , no more ; yet thereof made The player who the heart of Hamlet played !

		Ah , who shall e'er forget the sweet , grave face , The beauty flowering from a stately race , The mind of majesty , the heart of grace ? ''

		PROFESSOR JEBB 'S TRIBUTE TO
JOWETT	PERSON	.

		The following tribute to the late Master is paid him by Professor
R. C. Jebb	PERSON	, in the `` Cambridge Review '' : '' Slowly it dawned on one how maturely and firmly he possessed that which J. S. Mill recognizes in the old classics , ' the wisdom of life ' a fruit difficult to gather and to store ; he was indeed , in the best way , a consum - mate man of the world , while at heart so utterly un - worldly .

		His aim in education was to mould men who should be good and useful , whatever they might have to do ; and with this aim he had cultivated a sense of proportion , a perception of the relative importance of things , which he always wished to be shared by his friends , young or old .

		For instance , it was rather as an educator than as a specialist that he looked at class - ical studies ; his ideal scholar was
Erasmus	PERSON	, with whom , indeed , he had much in common .

		Erasmus sought , by his own methods , to make the best parts of ancient lit - erature widely profitable .

		Jowett , by that translation which is so matchless in its grace and charm , has added
Plato	ORGANIZATION	to the favorite authors of thousands who can not read Greek .

		The future of literary education in En - gland was a subject of which he thought much towards the close of his life .

		He would have liked some plan in which the great masterpieces of ancient and modern literature might equally find a place . ''

		SONHETS TO PROFESSOR
JOWETT	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	dedicates to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and publishes in the '' Athenfeum , '' these three sonnets to the memory of Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, with '' The Last Walk from Boar 's Hill '' for a title : ' One after one they go ; and glade and heath , Where once we walked with them , and garden-bowers They made so dear , are haunted by the hours Once musical of them who sleep beneath ; One after one does Sorrow 's every wreath Bind closer you and me with funeral flowers , And Love and Memory from each loss of ours Forge conquering glaives to quell the conqueror , Death .

		.

		Since Love and Memory now refuse to yield The friend with whom we walk thro ' mead and field To-day as on that day when last we parted , Can he be dead indeed , whatever seem ?

		Love shapes a presence out of
Memory	ORGANIZATION	's dream v A living presence ,
Jowett	PERSON	golden-hearted .

		ii . '

		Can he be dead ?

		We walk through flowery ways From Boar 's Hill down to
Oxford	LOCATION	, fain to know What nugget-gold , in drift of
Time	ORGANIZATION	's long flow , The Bodleian mine hath stored from richer days ; He , fresh as on that morn , with sparkling gaze , Hair bright as sunshine , white as moonlit snow , Still talks of Plato while the scene below Breaks gleaming through the veil of sunlit haze .

		Can he be dead ?

		He shares our homeward walk , And by the river you arrest the talk To see the sun transfigure ere he sets The boatmen 's children shining in the wherry And on the floating bridge the ply-rope wets , Making the clumsy craft an angels ' ferry .

		in . '

		The river crossed , we walk ` neath glowing skies Through grass where cattle feed or stand and stare With burnished coats glassing the colored air Fading as color after color dies : We pass the copse ; we round the leafy rise Start many a coney and partridge , hern and hare ; Then win the scholar 's nest his simple fare Made royal-rich by welcome in his eyes .

		Can he be dead ?

		His heart was drawn to you : Ah !

		well that kindred heart within him knew The poet 's heart of gold that gives his spell : Can he be dead ?

		Your heart being drawn to him , How shall ev 'n Death make that dear presence dim For you who loved him us who loved him well ? ''

		THE FORUM contains interpretations of contem - poraneous activity and opinion by the best minds of both continents .

		When our foremost men have important utterances they seek THE FORUM .

		Its writers , therefore , are the leaders in action and in opinion .

		In our time and country men have to do what men never had to do before : In politics there are new tasks ; in commerce , changing currents ; in in - dustry , colossal developments ; in education , new methods ; in science , new discoveries ; in society , new conditions ; even in religion , new attitudes everywhere there is a spirit of inquiry and of ex - periment .

		The foremost men of the world write the literature of contemporaneous activity for THE FORUM .

Burnett	PERSON	inpi ` t/o . ''

JOHN TYNDALL	PERSON	.

		Looking over the death-roll of the past year , we are more than once reminded of
Lear	PERSON	's terrible fatalism : ' * As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods , They kill us for their sport . ''


Freeman	PERSON	, hardly beyond his prime , found his death in a Spanish inn , the victim of a pox - infected mattress .


Symonds	PERSON	, with many fruitful years seemingly before him , was taken off by a cold that passed into pneumonia , while return - ing from the last of his Italian journeys .

		To Tschaikowsky , on a visit to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, death came in a pestilential draught of water , and Cholera marked him for her own in the fulness of his powers .

		Last of all , and most ironical in its accent , comes word that
John Tyndall	PERSON	is dead , but from no blow dealt by the legitimate assailants of mortality .

		An overdose of chloral , given by the fatal error of a loving wife , has cut short that career , prematurely , we must say , although the best of his work was doubtless accomplished .

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	occupied a large place in English scientific thought , and the vacancy caused by his death will not easily be filled .

		His original researches resulted in important contributions to knowledge , especially in the domain of molecular physics .

		Although they do not place him in the first rank of nineteenth century Englishmen of science , they secure for him a high position in the second .

		He belongs with Professor Huxley and Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	, rather than with
Darwin	PERSON	and
Maxwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had the German training , and he combined the German thoroughness with the English instinct for sys - tematic and perspicuous presentation .

		Great as was his service in the character of an investi - gator , he did a still greater service to his coun - trymen in the character of an expositor .

		What Professor
Huxley	PERSON	did for the new biology cre - ated by
Darwin	PERSON	, was done by Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	for the new physics created by
Joule	ORGANIZATION	and Far - aday and
Maxwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is customary in certain quarters to sneer at popular science ; and there is not a little popular science , so-called , which justifies the attitude of contempt .

		But no such reproach attaches to the work of men like
Tyn	PERSON	- dall , whose knowledge of the subjects with which he dealt was both thorough and accurate .

		It is difficult to estimate the full value of the work done for the advancement of English public opinion in matters of science by the group of writers to which
Tyndall	ORGANIZATION	belonged , and of which Professor Huxley is the most distin - guished remaining representative .

		They came at just the right time , and they brought just the right kind of powers to their task .

		Without the labors of these men , the great nineteenth century revolution in physical and biological science would indeed have been , none the later , & fait accompli ; but it would have taken much longer to reach the popular consciousness .

		Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	stood in the vanguard of the revolutionary forces , and bore the brunt of the battle .

		Twenty years ago , he incurred the odium , theologicum by an article in '' The Con - temporory Keview , '' proposing that the efficacy of prayer should be subjected to a scientific test .

		He little thought , good easy man , what a hor - nets ' nest this cold-blooded suggestion would bring about his ears .

		When , in the year fol - lowing this incident , he was presented at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	for the honorary doctorate , he found his can - didacy bitterly opposed by one of the professors of divinity in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, on the ground that his teachings contravened '' the whole tenor of that book , which with its open page inscribed Dominus ittnminatio meet the
University	ORGANIZATION	still bears as her device . ''

		Only a year later than this , his address before the
Belfast	LOCATION	meeting of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	, in which address he professed to discern in matter '' the promise and potency of every form and quality of life , '' again aroused his theological opponents , and fanned afresh the flame of their zealous indignation .

		Only three or four years before these occur - rences , Professor Huxley , in a lecture upon
Descartes	PERSON	, speaking of the religious persecution of which that philosopher was a victim , had said : '' There are one or two living men , who , a couple of centuries hence , will be remembered as
Descartes	ORGANIZATION	is now , because they have produced great thoughts which will live and grow as long as mankind lasts .

		If the twenty-first century studies their history , it will find that the
Chris	PERSON	- tianity of the middle of the nineteenth century recognized them only as objects of vilification . ''

		The vilification to which
Tyndall	PERSON	was subjected , in consequence of the acts above alluded to , came as a prompt and striking new illustration of Professor Huxley 's remark .

		Most earnest men , watching the world from day to day , get impatient because it moves so slowly .

		And yet , looking back over a few years , the same men will find cause for astonishment at the rapidity of its advance in this nineteenth century of ours .

		The Copernican doctrine re - quired from one to two centuries to make its way ; the Darwinian doctrine accomplished an equal revolution of thought in one or two de - cades .

		The suggestions that seemed so startling when made by
Tyndall	PERSON	twenty years ago would to-day hardly cause a ripple of excitement any - where .

		Few intelligent people , whatever their religious beliefs , are now shocked at the admis - sion of spontaneous generation as a necessary link in the evolutionary chain , and few of them hold to a doctrine of prayer that invites such tests as that proposed by
Tyndall	PERSON	in the early seventies .

		Of recent years ,
Tyndall	PERSON	has been assailed by the politicians almost as vehemently as he was once assailed by the theologians , and time will bring him a justification similar to that which it has brought him in the earlier con - troversy .

		In his denunciation of the recent Gladstonian attempt to dismember the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	he joined himself with such men as
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and his mem - ory need fear no defeat in that alliance .

		The noble intellectual temper of the man that has just died , the bent of mind which we venture to call essentially religious in spite of the religious antagonisms which it evoked , and the eloquence of expression that he knew how to im -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 part to the subjects which so deeply concerned him , may most fittingly be illustrated by the clos - ing paragraph of the famous
Belfast	LOCATION	Address : '' And now the end is come .

		With more time , or greater strength and knowledge , what has been here said might have been better said , while worthy matters here omitted might have received fit expression .

		But there would have been no material deviation from the views set forth .

		As regards myself , they are not the growth of a day ; and as regards you , I thought you ought to know the environment which , with or without your consent , is rapidly surrounding you , and in rela - tion to which some adjustment on your part may be necessary .

		A hint of Hamlet 's , however , teaches us all how the troubles of common life may be ended ; and it is perfectly possible for you and me to purchase intel - lectual peace at the price of intellectual death .

		The world is not without refuges of this description ; nor is it wanting in persons who seek their shelter and try to persuade others to do the same .

		I would exhort yon to refuse such shelter , and to scorn such base repose to accept , if the choice be forced upon you , commotion before stagnation , the leap of the torrent before the stillness of the swamp .

		In the one there is at all events life , and therefore hope ; in the other , none .

		I have touched on debatable questions , and led you over dan - gerous ground and this partly with the view of tell - ing you , and through you the world , that as regards these questions science claims unrestricted right of search .

		It is not to the point to say that the views of Lucretius and
Bruno	PERSON	, of
Darwin	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	, may be wrong .

		Here I should agree with you , deeming it in - deed certain that these views will undergo modification .

		But the point is , that , whether right or wrong , we claim the right to discuss them .

		The ground which they cover is scientific ground ; and the right claimed is one made good through tribulation and anguish , inflicted and endured in darker times than ours , but resulting in the immor - tal victories which science has won for the human race .

		I would set forth equally the inexorable advance of man 's understanding in the path of knowledge , and the unquenchable claims of his emotional nature which the understanding can never satisfy .

		The world embraces not only a
Newton	LOCATION	, but a Shakespeare not only a
Boyle	LOCATION	, but a
Raphael	PERSON	not only a Kant , but a Beethoven not only a
Darwin	LOCATION	, but a
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		Not in each of these , but in all , is human nature whole .

		They are not opposed , but supplementary not mutually exclusive , but reconcilable .

		And if , still unsatisfied , the human mind , with the yearning of a pilgrim for his distant home , will turn to the mystery from which it has emerged , seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith , so long as this is done , not only with - out intolerance or bigotry of any kind , but with the en - lightened recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable , and that each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance with its own needs then , in opposition to all the restric - tions of materialism , I would affirm this to be a field for the noblest exercise of what , in contrast with the knowing faculties , may be called the creative faculties of man .

		Here , however , I must quit a theme too great for me to handle , but which will be handled by the loftiest minds ages after you and I , like streaks of morning cloud , shall have melted into the infinite azure of the past . ''

		This fine peroration , which we have quoted in its entirety , serves better than a volume of comment to explain the influence which
Tyn	PERSON	- dall has exerted upon his contemporaries , and especially upon the younger generation .

		The scientist of the dryasdust type may scoff at it as mere rhetoric , but it has stirred many of its readers as with a trumpet-call to steadfast - ness and honesty of purpose in the pursuit of truth .

		The power to write in this fashion , backed by the power to employ the most rigor - ious of scientific methods in his own researches , made of Tyndall one of the most vital of the directive intellectual forces of his age , and brings to his memory a host of mourners who early caught the contagion of his spirit , and have sought to follow in his footsteps .

		BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY .


John Tyndall	PERSON	was born
August 21 , 1820	DATE	, in the village of Leighlin Bridge ,
Carlow	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		His parents were poor , and could give him only a com - mon-school education .

		In
1839	DATE	he took a position with the
Irish Ordnance Survey	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1844	DATE	, he be - came a railway engineer .

		In
1847	DATE	, he became a teacher in
Queenwood College	ORGANIZATION	,
Hants	LOCATION	, a technical school .

		Here he met Dr.
Frankland	PERSON	, and his stud - ies were definitely turned in the direction of phys - ical science .

		The next year he went to
Germany	LOCATION	, and studied at Marburg under Bunsen and others .

		From Marburg he went to
Berlin	LOCATION	and there contin - ued his studies under Magnus .

		His first scientific paper was on screw-surfaces , and his second a study in the magnetic properties of crystals .

		The latter was published in
1850	DATE	.

		He then returned to En - gland , and settled in
London	LOCATION	, where he became ac - quainted with
Faraday	PERSON	.

		In
1852	DATE	he was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1853	DATE	was ap - pointed a professor of natural philosophy in the
Royal Institution of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	.

		He afterwards succeeded
Faraday	DATE	as Superintendent of that Insti - tution .

		He had already , as early as
1849	DATE	, visited the Alps for recreation , and the habit thus acquired lasted for the rest of his lifetime , resulting , among other things , in that classic of mountaineering , '' Hours of Exercise in the Alps '' -LRB- 1871 -RRB- .

		His first scientific expedition to the Alps was made in
1856	DATE	, in company with Professor Huxley , and resulted in the joint treatise '' On the Structure and Motion of Glaciers . ''

		Other fruits of his Alpine experiences were the `` Glaciers of the Alps '' -LRB- I860 -RRB- , and '' A Vacation Tour '' -LRB- 1863 -RRB- .

		In
1859	DATE	he began his re - searches in radiant heat , which resulted in the works , '' Heat as a Mode of Motion '' -LRB- 1863 -RRB- , '' On
Radi	PERSON	- ation '' -LRB- 1865 -RRB- , and `` Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat . ''

		He pub - lished a work on '' Sound '' in
1865	DATE	, and a similar volume on '' Light '' in
1870	DATE	.

		Other publications of this period were `` Faraday as a Discoverer '' -LRB- 1868 -RRB- , `` On the Scientific Use of the Imagina - tion '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- , the first volume of `` Fragments of 380 THE DIAL -LSB- Dee .

		16 , Science '' -LRB- 1871 -RRB- , and `` The Forms of Water '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- .

		In this latter year he lectured in the
United States	LOCATION	, giving thirty-five addresses in all .

		These lectures were largely attended , and the net proceeds , amounting to S23 ,000 , were placed in the hands of a committee to be used for the endow - ment of research in American colleges .

		Cambridge had made him an LL.D .

		in
1855	DATE	and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	; in
1873	DATE	Oxford made him , despite the pro- test of the theologians , a D.C.L. .

		The
Belfast	LOCATION	Ad - dress was given in
1874	DATE	.

		In
1876	DATE	he married the eldest daughter of Lord
Claud Hamilton	PERSON	.

		He has held a number of posts under the English govern - ment .

		Among his later works may be mentioned `` On the Transmission of Sound by the Atmo - sphere '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , `` Lessons in Electricity '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- , `` Fermentation '' -LRB- 1877 -RRB- , `` Essays on the Floating Matter of the Air '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , and a second series of the popular '' Fragments of Science '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- .

		He died on the fourth of this month at his home in
Haslemere	LOCATION	,
Surrey	LOCATION	.

		RADCLIFFE COLLEGE .

		.

		The change of name and of constitution whereby the
Harvard Annex	ORGANIZATION	has become
Radcliffe College	ORGANIZATION	calls for the heartiest congratulations from all work - ers in behalf of the higher education of women .

		At the same time , the nature of the change effected has been in some respects misinterpreted by the news - paper reports .

		To correct mistaken impressions , we reprint the resolutions in which the new plan is for - mulated .

		These resolutions were passed by the An - nex Corporation , and accepted by the
Corporation and Overseers of the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Voted , That it is desirable to change the name of this corporation to
Radcliffe College	ORGANIZATION	, and that proper legal steps be taken to effect that change . ''

		Voted , That it is desirable that this corporation give degrees in arts and sciences , and that a committee of three persons be appointed by the president to take steps to obtain from the legislature the necessary power . ''

		Voted , That the president and fellows of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	be and hereby are made and appointed the vis - itors of this corporation , and hereby vested with all vis - itorial power and authority as fully as if the same had been originally conferred upon the said president and fellows by the charter or articles of association of this corporation .

		This vote shall take effect upon an ac - ceptance by the said president and fellows of the powers hereby conferred , but with the provision that the said president and fellows at any time may abandon and sur - render or limit such powers upon notice to this corpor - ation .

		`` Voted , That no instructor or examiner of this cor - poration shall be appointed , employed , or retained with - out the approval of the visitors of this corporation man - ifested in such way as said visitors may prescribe .

		`` Voted , That in case the president and fellows of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	accept the powers conferred by the foregoing vote , the said president and fellows be re - quested to empower the president of
Harvard Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity to countersign the diplomas of this corporation and to affix the seal of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	to said diplomas . ''

		The change has not been made , as has been stated , in consequence of any endowment , nor does it mean co-education .

		But it does provide for bestowing the
University	ORGANIZATION	degree upon graduates of what has been known as the Annex , in place of the certificates heretofore issued .

		The institution has recently come into possession of two gifts , amounting , jointly , to about
$ 150,000	MONEY	.

		Since the fees from students have exceeded the expenses of the Annex for the past five years , the new college is in a satisfactory financial condition .

		Its name is , very appropriately , that of the first woman who ever made a gift of money to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ROMANCE .

		The now palpable reaction from the realistic , so - called , in English fiction to the romantic as a form and a method , suggests an historical retrospect .

		The fact is , the romance , in its several kinds , has persisted for centuries in our native novel , and its resurgence to-day is only a demonstration to be prophesied from past experiences in fictional evolution .

		Nor is the explanation far to seek .

		All the world loves a story , as it does a lover ; and psychologic interest , the analysis of motive and character , will never take the place of that object - ive interest which centres in action , situation , and denouement .

		Our age takes more kindly to such methods and motives than did its predecessors ; in - deed , it has been taught to do so , and the novel of subjective tendency may be styled the chosen vehi - cle of expression .

		But always those who read as they run .

		and the more critical class which seeks in books illusion from the workaday world , will desire the adventure story and the heroic presentment of human life .

		A host of people agree with Balzac that the writer of fiction should strive to portray society not solely as it is , but as it is hoped it will be in that `` possibly better '' state suggested by present improvement .

		One is struck by this in the simple inductive process of inquiry among intelli - gent book-lovers ; the present writer has found that a large proportion go to novels for rest and recrea - tion , rather than for a criticism of life or aesthetic stimulation , least of all for spiritual profit .

		If this last is to result , let it be unobtrusive , by way of in - direction , not through the avowed tendenz fiction , seems to be the cry .

		Text-books are fond of emphasizing the birth of the modern analytic novel with
Richardson	PERSON	and Fielding , as if thereafter the whole trend were toward the subjective social study .

		It is true enough that a new impulse and manner were intro - duced by those worthies ; but twenty odd years be - fore `` Pamela '' and `` Tom

1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 tales that had gone before , and , to look to origins , is justified by the Spanish fictionists from whom our romance sprang .

		An early English example of the picaresque is
Nash	PERSON	's ``
Jack Wilton	PERSON	, '' which , clumsy as it is , and naively childish to modern taste , does nevertheless explain De Foe on the one hand and the penny-dreadful on the other .


Jack	PERSON	, a page in the English army in
France	LOCATION	at the siege of
Tourney	ORGANIZATION	, and a fellow of infinite gusto , much travel , and many escapades , is perhaps the first picturesque rascal in a genre to be afterwards enriched by Du - mas and broadened and modified by Le Sage ,
Hugo	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		He is the father of harum - scarums , and he initiates for all time the type of the picaresque story that division of the romance the essence of which lies in brisk , breathless adven - turing , and a lusty enjoyment of life as incident and spectacle .

		Such later divisions , of course , as the pastoral romance early exampled in Lyly 's 4 ` Euphues '' and
Sidney	PERSON	's ``
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' and finding its modern representation in Mr.
Black	PERSON	, Mr.
Black	PERSON	- more , and others , and the bombastic pseudo - romance borrowed from the French of Scarron et Cie. , and thank heaven pretty much dead to-day , swell with contributory streams the now stately river of romance .

		But the adventure - tale that eventuates in `` Kidnapped '' and `` The Refugees '' is to be tracked down to ``
Jack Wilton	PERSON	, '' artless product of Elizabethan times .

		Nor , if we overlook the mere matter of prose form , may we hesitate to go further back in look - ing for the genesis of the spirit and purpose of the English romance .

		We shall meet with it several centuries earlier , in that sterling , sturdy literary form the ballad ; in certain of the verse narratives of Chaucer ; yes , in the Old English epics them - selves .

		Other times , other customs , and saga , epic , apologue , ballad , or novel may be the chosen vehi - cle ; but the liking for story is a constant factor .

		The instinct for romance is the instinct for illu - sion , a request for pictures of a livelier and love - lier world than that we live in ; it were foolish not to expect its gratification in art all along in the de - velopment of our literature .

		With this continual outcropping , this cyclic persistence , of the romance in English fiction , notable contributions in this kind may be anticipated in the near future as a rebound from the deification of the psycho-analytic .

		The public is eager for it -LRB- apply the test of sales in the case of recent prominent romantic novels -RRB- ; and the writers of fiction take heart for the attempt , or by a natural resilience are of the tribe of Dan .

		But whether the movement produce marvels of roman - tic composition this decade or the next century , it is safe to say that the field will always be cultivated , appealing as it does to a permanent taste and sat - isfying an inevitable hunger .

		By no means is it to be said that the school of Messrs.
Howells	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	is in its decadence ; fruitful and important work is sure to come thence , and its possibilities , especially in the domain of psychology , are as yet but half realized .

		But it is well to bear down on the fact that the pedigree of this school is no better than , is indeed not so old and honorable as , that which has De Foe as past-master in the
last century	DATE	and is vigorously championed in Jin de siecle En - glish letters by Messrs.
Kipling	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		And it should be understood that this reaction toward incident in fiction is a phase of the wider protest against the abuse of that misnamed realism for which partialism is a fitter term .

		It is part of a tendency which has produced in
Paris	LOCATION	, the strong - hold of the opposite influence , a revival denomi - nated neo-idealism , resulting in symbolism in poetry and
M. Wagner	PERSON	's noble trumpet-call to the younger generation .

		Romanticism is to idealism in the novel what the garment is to the soul .

		In this broader implication , the romance includes Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's ''
David Grieve	PERSON	'' and Mrs.
Hunt	PERSON	's ''
Ramona	PERSON	, '' books treating life in its more ideal aims and relations .

		The romance of the future will present such high interests keeping pace with the evolution of society ; and its vantage-ground over the romance of years agone will be that it is firm-based on truth to the phenomena of life , and is thus , in the only true sense , realistic .

		Nobler in content , and persist - ent in type , the romance , broadly viewed , may be regarded as that form of literature which more than any other shall reflect the aspirations of the individual and the social progress of the state .

		SONNET-GOLD .

		We get it from Etruscan tombs , hid deep Beneath the passing ploughshare ; or from caves , Known but to

Earth	LOCATION	's dwarf slaves Coin in her bosom , 'til the red gold paves Her whole great heart , where only poets peep ; Or from old missals , where the gold defies
Time	ORGANIZATION	's tooth , in saints ' bright aureoles , and keeps , In angels ' long straight trumpets , all its flash ; But mostly from the crucible where lies The alchemist 's pure dream-gold : while he sleeps The poet steals it , leaving him the ash .

Inez	PERSON	' funeral crown , the day the grave Showed her for coronation , all myrrh then ?

		The best would be to make a hilt of gold For Life 's keen falchion ; like a dragon 's head , Fierce and fantastic , massive in your hold ; But oft the goldsmith 's chisel makes instead A fretted shrine for sorrows that are old , And passions that are sterile or are dead .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your excellent notice , in the current number of THE DIAL , of the recently issued government report on Libraries , you refer to the statement , made in that re - port , as to the four largest libraries in the country , for the purpose of pointing out an error by which the Bos - ton
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is credited with too large a number of volumes .

		Apparently you overlooked the fact that the most glaring discrepancy in the list is in assigning to the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	380,000 volumes .

		I am just collecting the statistics of libraries for my forth - coming book , '' Public Libraries in
America	LOCATION	, '' and Mrs.
Dixson	PERSON	, the acting librarian of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , gives me the present number of volumes as about 250,000 .

		The recently issued Register of the Univer - sity puts the number at 232,000 .

		Mrs.
Dixson	PERSON	reports that 75,000 of the present 250,000 have been acquired during the past twelve months , so that the library can hardly have numbered more than 150,000 volumes when this
U. S.	PERSON	report was made up .

		How its size came to be so over-stated is an interesting question .

		-LSB- We did not question the figures given for the library of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, because no one seems to know just what those figures should really be .

		The bulk of the library is made up of a collection purchased from
Calvary	LOCATION	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, nearly two years ago .

		This collection seems to have been purchased on the `` pig in a poke '' principle , and was estimated to include something like 300,000 volumes , a large proportion of these -LRB- perhaps one - fourth -RRB- being unbound dissertations .

		We under - stand that the whole of this collection has not yet been housed in the library .

		It was , however , owned by the
University	ORGANIZATION	at the time when the government report was prepared .

		From statements made to us at various times by the authorities of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , we concluded that the number of volumes re - ported was approximately correct , if pamphlets were counted , as in the case of the Harvard -LRB- not the
Boston	LOCATION	Public -RRB- Library .

		The report of 232,000 volumes in the
University Register	ORGANIZATION	expressly ex - cludes pamphlets and books not actually in the library .

		`` AIRS AND MANNERS '' IN THE OLD DOMINION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reading Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page 's rather florid article on '' The Old Dominion , '' in the
December	DATE	`` Har - per , '' one can not but be struck by the continuous strain of old-time laudation of
Virginia	LOCATION	and everything Vir - ginian , that savors strongly of the somewhat boastful period '' before the war . ''

		The women are prettier , the men more brilliant and gallant , the children more inter - esting , and all , old or young , '' have something about them an air , a manner , a something which is more attractive '' than one can discover in mortals north of the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		Altogether , it is a picture in high lights ; there are no shadows .

		One may read the article from beginning to end , without discovering that a Virginian ever had a fault .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	's Colonel Carters of Car - tersville have all the virtues of Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's , but none of their weaknesses .

		They even talked so - well that '' it is said that
Thackeray	PERSON	stated that he heard the purest Saxon English in
Virginia	LOCATION	that he had ever heard .

		Freeman and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	are quoted to the same effect at a later time . ''

		But the reader who is curious to note the signs of the times will find more significance in the political than in the social aspects of Mr.
Page	PERSON	's article , coming as it does from a writer who has grown up since the war .

		There is nowhere in it so much as a hint that the Vir - ginians were wrong in following the hot-headed and unreasoning states of the South into that rebellion which
Virginia	LOCATION	first condemned and then embraced .

		On the contrary , the tone of approval and laudation is still dom - inant .

		In speaking of
Richmond	LOCATION	, the writer says that '' for a hundred years and more the city has been asso - ciated with all that Virginians are proud of '' ; and he then proceeds to enumerate some of the things of which they are proud : '' Here sat and deliberated -LSB- ! -RSB-

		the Se - cession Convention during the period when
Virginia	LOCATION	stood as the peace-maker between the two sections .

		Here she finally declared her decision to secede from the Union ... Here the Confederate government passed its life , and from here the Southern side of the war was fought ... Whilst
Richmond	LOCATION	stood the Confederacy stood , '' etc. .

		Such are the things that give the city its chief glory in the eyes of true Virginians .

		Northern conservatives , who have been inclined to sympathize with the South in its recent unfortunate condition , will be surprised and pained to read many things in this article .

		They have been wont to think that sensible Southern people had seen that the Rebel - lion , with its fruitless loss and devastation , was at least a mistake , and not a thing to be especially proud of ; but such utterances as these will lead many to doubt whether it is not yet too early to cherish or express sympathy with those who still maintain such sentiments .

		It seems a pity that such an article should have been written or printed , representing as it does a class who have learned nothing from experience , and have forgot - ten the present and the future in blind admiration of an ignorant and often mistaken past .

		WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH JOHN BULL ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		To a logical mind , there is always a satisfaction in finding persons and things consistent with themselves ; and this form of satisfaction is ours on reading the characteristic comments of the leading John Bull organ , the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' on the subject of the
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition , as reprinted in your last issue .

		Those comments are about such as might have been expected from such a source ; hence they afford the logical satis - faction referred to , and are also delightful in many ways .

		Nowhere else could we expect to find , at this stage , the Exposition styled a '' local show '' and a '' fiz - zle , '' or its promoters and managers so courteously and discerningly individualized as `` the ignorant million - aire , the grain-man , the pig-man , the bust dude , the Irish politician , the anarchist , '' as it is given in the ele - gant phraseology of this uncompromising defender of the classic .

		No one who knows the
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	type of Englishmen will be surprised that they should regard the Exposition as a '' local show . ''

		Of course it seems local to them ; anything beyond the coast of
Britain	LOCATION	is ,

		THE DIAL 383 to the arboreal fancy of these belated Druids , necessa - rily local and despisable .

		It seems to me the practical question is , how shall these familiar exhibitions of ''
John Bull	PERSON	at his worst '' be treated in
America	LOCATION	?

		Shall his primitive insularity and his native proneness to Philistinism be regarded , in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's phrase , as an '' insuperable proclivity , '' and therefore he be let alone ?

		Or , if to familiarize him with modern ideas and world-tendencies be thought possible and desirable , how shall the requisite mission - ary labors be directed ?

		And ought we not to take into account what we should lose if these efforts were success - ful ?

		Is not
J. B.	PERSON	more amusing , and hence more de - sirable , as he is ?

		Byron , a good judge of European traits and manners , recorded his opinion as follows : '' The world is a big load of hay ; Mankind are the asses that pull ; Each tugs in a different way But the greatest of all is
John Bull	PERSON	. ''

		Would it not , therefore , be more profitable to us Amer - icans , who inherit still a trace of the bear-baiting pro- clivities of our British ancestry , to allow him to con - tinue in his favorite role as the ass par excellence among national characters ?

		Who is there to take his place ?

		where else among the nations of the earth could so amusing a character such a possierlicher Dummkopf be found ?

		Unameliorated by the refining influences of foreign civilization ,
John Bull	PERSON	is pretty sure to be
John Bull	PERSON	for a long time to come ; hugging himself closer in his insularity , and throwing dust and mud over every - thing that is new and unintelligible to him which leaves to him yet a very large field for the exercise of his peculiar powers .

		All these points and more are in - volved in the interesting problem , What shall we do with
John Bull	PERSON	?

Chicago	LOCATION	,

		A DISCLAIMER AND AN EXPLANATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As was the surprise of
Monsieur Jourdain	PERSON	, on being told that he talked prose , even so was mine , when I found myself credited by Mr.
W. H. Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- in THE DIAL for
Nov. 1	DATE	-RRB- with a `` style , '' nay , `` a peculiarity of style . ''

		There are , however , in the case of every one , things growing out of his idiosyncrasy which others are beforehand with him in discovering .

		Reputation for a literary style those may spell for who are so inclined ; but why should it be assumed that I am one of them ?

		As to the way in which my trivi - alities are expressed , I have never given the subject a thought , regard for intelligibility and verbal economy excepted .

		A commonplace person who aims at no more than this , and succeeds in his aim fairly well , will deliver himself only indifferently , at best ; and to say that he has a style , or effects any approach to one worth speak - ing of , is , it appears to me , making too much of his insignificance .

		My fashion of writing , which I had all along thought to be precisely such as that just described , was , I had hoped , so unnoticeable as not to divert atten - tion from my matter to my manner .

		My hopes have been doomed to disappointment .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is of opinion that my sentences too often have a '' broken character . ''

		Let me , in passing , regret that they have broken his aesthetic repose .

		To make good his complaint , he quotes from me at length , adding the judgment that parallels to his quotations '' would not be from writers who have won any reputation for grace - ful expression of their ideas . ''

		But , as a prudent cripple would not attempt to dance , why should Awk O'Speech be ambitious of a distinction which he knows he could never achieve , do what he might ?

		Suppose that nature and circumstances , in malign conspiracy , have turned a man out rhetorically left-handed , crump-shouldered , lop-sided , baker-kneed , ungainly all round .

		What is there , pray , for such a hapless abortion to do , except to throw himself on the compassion of his fellow-creatures , and to thank destiny that there are constellations more sinister than the one which was told off for him ?

		We all of us write pretty much as it pleases
Providence	LOCATION	.

		Brevis esse laboro , dbscurus Jio , I shall not admit .

		Though I study to be concise , my drift , unless I deceive myself , is always unmistakable .

		Nor is perplexity entailed by the involutions which , brevity consulted , are frequently necessitated by the qualifications requisite in order to the exact conveyance of my meaning .

		Where these involutions occur , and also on other occasions , I try to lighten the labor of the reader by free recourse to commas , using them largely instead of brackets ; and hence it is that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	detects , in my sentences , what he designates as a '' broken character . ''

		This de - signation is not , to my mind , altogether appropriate .

		Be that as it may , however , my critic is perhaps a trifle flattering , when he silently takes it for granted that others , if unaided by the clue of liberal punctuation , would approve themselves his match in threading my labyrinths .

		The question of expressional uncouthness having been started , I transcribe some specimens of it , in presence of which those that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	takes from me must hide their diminished heads .

		I came on them in Thomas Hope 's '' Essay on the Origin and Prospects of Man , '' published in
1831	DATE	: '' Sometimes , after of compounds certain substances are , by effervescence or fermentation , thrown off , the remaining ones , instead of being left to subside , again from without take in new gases , which again of the compound change the nature and the faculties . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 293 . -RRB- ''

		Of the heat in the daytime from the sun radiated to the earth , at night , when , of this radiance from without the pres - sure ceases , a certain portion is from the earth and from its productions again radiated into outer space . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 294 . -RRB- ''

		Thus , of heat a certain portion , in a body by cold solidi - fied penetrating , confined and accumulated , till by its pressure from within that body on its surrounding envelopes , it dis - tends and dissevers these inclosures , and is again by them let out and left to cooperate , will by the very excess of its strength lose that strength , and again , as it again spreads further , proportionably weaken . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		III. , p. 222 . -RRB-

		That these passages fell from the pen of the author of '' Anastasius '' seems almost incredible .

		For curiosities of felonious construction well-nigh as striking as those given from Hope ,
Jeremy Bentham	PERSON	, among modern authors , might be cited to any extent whatever , desirable or undesirable .

		Guided by a ra - tional taste ,
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, in reviewing the famous '' Book of Fallacies , '' introduces its author to the public only '' after that eminent philosopher has been washed , trimmed , shaved , and forced into clean linen . ''

		Whitefield , we read , once fancied , for a while , that the Lord `` required him to go nasty '' ; and not a few writers , entreated spitefully by the fates , and wrestling with them in vain , '' go nasty , '' metaphorically , all their days .

		The pity which the benevolent are moved to bestow on their unhappy case I would be allowed to participate .

Dec. 16	DATE	,
WALTER SCOTT	PERSON	'S TJETTERS .

		* In the preface to the abridged edition -LRB- 1848 -RRB- of his Life of
Scott	PERSON	,
Lockhart	PERSON	inserted the following paragraph : '' I should have been iiiore willing to produce an enlarged edition ; for the interest of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's history lies , 1 think , peculiarly in its minute details espe - cially in the details set down by himself in his letters and diaries ; and , of course , after the lapse of ten years more copious use might be made of those materials without offense or indecorum . ''

		Near half a century has elapsed since these words were penned ; and in the interim the '' Journal '' covering the period from
1825	DATE	, just before the Constable and the
Ballantyne	PERSON	failures , to
1835	DATE	, the year of
Scott	ORGANIZATION	's death has appeared .

		The `` Life '' and the '' Journal '' having thus been issued , only the '' Letters '' were needed to complete this unu - sually full , rich , and significant life-record ; and these now lie before us .

		The editor , Mr.
David Douglas	PERSON	, has executed his trust with the same care and minuteness shown in his editing of the '' Journal '' perhaps this time with some - thing of that loving over-elaboration which one is apt to bestow upon a specially congenial task .

		The letters are placed in chronological order , and they are grouped in twenty-four brief chap - ters , each of which is prefaced by a useful table of '' Family Annals and Literary Work , '' as well as by a rather supererogatory motto , gen - erally a passage selected from Sir
Walter	PERSON	's poetical works .

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	's notes are very full unf ashionably full ; but they are in them - selves so entertaining , so rich in lively personal chat and ana , that we should be sorry to spare one of them .

		The letters range from
1797	DATE	, the year of the writer 's marriage , to
1825	DATE	, the eve of the period when , at the age of fifty-five , overwhelmed by a debt of 150,000 , he sat down at his desk to begin a struggle for honor 's sake which was to end
six years later	DATE	, not in a loss of courage , but in a decline of the powers necessary to carry it on .

		The annals of
Scotia	LOCATION	are eminently rich in examples of patient hero - ism in adversity a quality that , like love of clan and country , seems inherent in her people .

		But none of her plaided or her mail-clad heroes have shown a braver front to disaster than did her great romancer .

		tions and ideals which formed the flower and finer spirit of the older Toryism Feudalism , if you will the call of honor , the claim of an obligation , was a peremptory one that brooked no denial or thought of denial .

		The distinction , born of commercial usage and expediency , be - tween a mercantile and personal obligation , was not for him .

		To the
Master of Abbotsford	ORGANIZATION	a debt incurred was a debt to be wiped out to the uttermost farthing ; and so he labored on to the end , with the dogged pertinacity of his nation , at the Sisyphus-stone of vicarious debt that finally crushed him .

		In making up the present volumes , the editor has prudently and widely departed from his original plan of including in them only the letters addressed by Sir
Walter	PERSON	to members of his own family .

		A number of letters written to some of his closest friends have also been introduced ; and in addition to these are some notable ones addressed to Sir
Walter	PERSON	by such correspondents as
Jeffrey	PERSON	,
Lady Stuart	LOCATION	,
Joanna Baillie	PERSON	,
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	-LRB- who makes an appeal in behalf of the impecunious
Godwin	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The letter from the last-named writer is the reply to a proposal to become editor of a Scotch newspaper a post for which Irving acknowledged himself to be eminently unsuited .

		He writes : '' Your literary proposal both surprises and flatters me , as it evinces a much higher opinion of my talents and capacity than I possess myself .

		I am peculiarly unfitted for the post proposed ... My whole course of life has been desultory , and I am unfitted for any periodically recurring task , or any stipulated labor of body or mind .

		I have no command over my talents such as they are ; am apt to be deserted by them when I most want their assistance , and have to watch the veerings of my mind as I would those of a weather - cock .

		Practice and training may briug me more into rule , but at present I am as unfit for service in the ranks as one of my own country Indians or a Don Cos - sack .

		I must therefore keep on pretty much as I have begun , writing when I can and not when I would . ''

		The '' Letters '' begin , as we have said , in
1797	DATE	, the year of Scott 's marriage ; and the opening ones , addressed to
Miss Carpenter	PERSON	, afford , it must be owned , some rather doleful specimens of the Caledonian love-letter .

		The last one , in particular , closes with a passage that would have done credit to Mr.
Pegotty	PERSON	's '' lone and lorn '' inmate , Mrs. Gumniidge : '' When you go to the South of
Scotland	LOCATION	with me , '' writes the expectant lover , after alluding to some an - cestral matters , `` you will see their burying-place , now all that remains with my father of a very handsome property .

		It is one of the most beautiful and romantic scenes you ever saw , among the ruins of an old abbey .

		When I die ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	, you must cause my bones to be
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 laid there ; but we shall have many happy days before that , I hope . ''

		To this cheerful and timely request Miss Car - penter a lively young woman endowed with scant reverence for ancestral bones sensibly replied : '' What an idea of yours was that to mention where you wish to have your bones laid !

		If you were mar - ried I should think you were tired of me .

		A very pretty compliment before marriage !

		I hope sincerely I shall not live to see that day .

		If you always have those cheerful thoughts , how very pleasant and gay you must be !

		Adieu , my dearest friend .

		Take care of yourself if you love me , as I have no wish that you should visit that beautiful and romantic scene , the bury - ing place . ''

		One fancies that the lover must have derived chagrin and solace in about equal measure from this satirical epistle .

		Viewing the Letters as a whole , and seek - ing for their prevalent and distinctive note , we should say that it lay in a certain largeness and manliness of tone , and in an impersonal and ingenious way of viewing men and motives that is rare enough in the familiar letters of the brethren of the genus irritabile .

		There are many allusions to brother authors -LRB- a term that usually scarcely expresses the actual relation -RRB- , but nowhere is there a hint of jealousy or de - traction not even at the period when the writer 's own poetical star was unmistakably paling before that of
Byron	PERSON	.

		For this declen - sion Sir
Walter	PERSON	was certainly well indemnified by the magnificent success of his prose tales ; but the provocation , nevertheless , was sharp enough , and the rival was an especially vulner - able one .

		To those who know
Scott	PERSON	at all it is scarcely necessary to sa -RCB- 7 that his letters have the prime epistolary merit of frankness ; not frankness of the morbid , self-dissecting sort , but the hearty outspokenness of the large - souled , cordial man , who invites the confidence of his friends , and gives them his own in re - turn .

		Scott 's writings are always the whole - somest of reading .

		There is that in them that tones and braces the mind , as the breath of his own heath-clad hills and moors tones and braces the body ; but in nothing that he has written is this rare tonic quality so marked as in his admirable letters .

		What could be more thor - oughly sound and excellent , albeit in a somewhat homely way , than the following '' Letter to a Schoolboy , '' written to a lad of fifteen who had sent the author of ''
Marmion	PERSON	'' some speci - mens of his own versification : '' ... The friends who know me best , and to whose judgment I am myself in the constant habit of trusting , reckon me a very capricious and uncertain judge of po - etry ; and I have had repeated occasion to observe that I have often failed in anticipating the reception of po - etry by the public .

		Above all , sir , I must warn you against suffering yourself to suppose that the power of enjoying natural beauty and poetical description are necessarily connected with that of producing poetry .

		The former is really a gift of
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, which conduces inestimably to the happiness of those who enjoy it .

		The second has much more of a knack in it than the pride of poets is always willing to admit ; and , at any rate , is only valuable when combined with the first .

		... I would also caution you against an enthusiasm which , while it argues an excellent disposition and a feeling heart , requires to be watched and restrained , though not repressed .

		It is apt , if too much indulged , to engender a fastidious contempt for the ordinary business of the world , and gradually to render us unfit for the exercise of the useful and domestic virtiies which depend greatly upon our not exalting our feelings above the temper of well-ordered and well-educated society .

		No good man can ever be happy when he is unfit for the career of simple and commonplace duty ; and I need not add how many melancholy instances there are of extravagance and profligacy being resorted to under pretense of con - tempt for the common rules of life .

		Cultivate , then , sir , your taste for poetry and the belles-lettres , as an elegant and most interesting amusement ; but combine it with studies of a more severe and solid cast , and such as are most intimately connected with your prospects in future life .

		Many tyros went to him for advice -LRB- which in such cases usually means for approval -RRB- , and while some of them undoubtedly went away disappointed , no one certainly went away cha - grined or empty-handed .

		In the
Abbotsford	LOCATION	collection there are many letters from boys and young men seeking literary counsel , all of which Sir
Walter	PERSON	appears to have replied to , and then folded carefully , writing name and date on the back of each .

		How many incipient Chatter - tons he thus turned from the squalid garrets of the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Grub Street into the respect - able , if prosaic , paths of process-drawing and cheese-mongering , history tells not ; but the number may well have been considerable .

		We have spoken of
Scott	PERSON	's letters touching his great rival and poetical successor ,
Byron	PERSON	; and as this portion of his correspondence can - not fail to be of general interest we shall quote from it pretty freely .

		The first two cantos of '' Childe Harold '' appeared in
February , 1812	DATE	, and in the following May
Scott	PERSON	wrote to Mr.
Morritt	PERSON	: '' I agree very much in what you say of ' Childe Har - old . '

		Though there is something provoking and insult - ing both to morality and to feeling in his misanthropical humor , it gives , nevertheless , an odd pungency to his descriptions and reflections , and upon the whole it is a 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, poem of most extraordinary power , and may rank its author with our first poets .

		I see the '
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Re - view ' has hauled its wind , which I suppose is as much owing to Lord
Byron	PERSON	's political conversion as to their conviction of his increasing powers . ''

		Writing to Lady Abercorn in
January , 1813	DATE	, Sir
Walter	PERSON	goes on to say of '' Childe Harold '' : `` You ask me how I like Lord
Byron	PERSON	's poem , and I answer , very much .

		There is more original strength and force of thinking in it , as well as command of lan - guage and versification , than in almost any modern poem of the same length that I have happened to meet with .

		It is really a powerful poem , the more power - ful because it arrests the attention without the aid of narrative , and without the least apparent wish to con - ciliate the favor of the reader , but rather an affectation of the contrary .

		I say an affectation of the contrary , because I should be sorry to think that a young man of Lord
Byron	PERSON	's powers should really and unaffectedly en - tertain and encourage a contempt for all sublunary com - forts and enjoyments ... This tinge of discontent , or perhaps one may almost say misanthropy , is the only objection I have to Lord B. 's very powerful and origi - nal work . ''

		There is an expression in the letter above that is very characteristic of the essential man - liness and candor of
Scott	PERSON	's nature .

		To admit , as he did , that
Byron	PERSON	's verse could dispense with `` the aid of narrative , '' was to admit its poetical superiority to his own chansons de geste , in which the epic element was confess - edly the vital one .

		Between `` Childe Harold , '' with its splendid power and energy , its pro- found passion and sustained melody , and his own ``
Marmion	PERSON	, '' with its ballad lilt and easy sentiment , there was obviously a difference not only of kind but of rank ; and
Scott	PERSON	could ac - knowledge this the more readily in that he saw that where he himself was undeniably strong , his rival was lamentably weak .

		Scott is , all in all , the best of story-tellers ; it is not too much to say that
Byron	PERSON	is one of the worst .

		No less sober and discerning than his appraisal of
Byron	PERSON	's verse is his appraisal of his charac - ter .

		Scott saw in the fashionable bard neither a sublime and mysterious ''
Lara	PERSON	'' an incar - nation of the sombre and misanthropic heroes he chose to portray on the one hand , nor , on the other , a mere attitudinizing coxcomb .

		The ultra class of
Byron	PERSON	's admirers delighted to in - vest his career with something of the pseudo - grandeur of veiled and romantic crime ; clear - headed Sir
Walter	PERSON	saw that mere vulgar vice , such as any sixpenny rake in Cheapside might indulge in , had been much more in his lord - ship 's line and he was generous enough to deplore the fact , and to try to palliate it .

		His final word on
Byron	PERSON	is expressed in a letter to Lady Abercorn , dated
June 4 , 1824	DATE	: `` I have been terribly distressed at poor
Byron	PERSON	's death .

		In talents he was unequalled , and his faults were those rather of a bizarre temper , arising from an eager and irritable nervous habit , than any depravity of disposition .

		He was devoid of selfishness , which I take to be the basest ingredient in the human disposi - tion .

		He was generous , humane , and noble-minded , when passion did not blind him .

		The worst I ever saw about him was that he rather liked indifferent com - pany , than that of those with whom he must from char - acter and talent have necessarily conversed more upon an equality .

		I believe much of his affected misanthropy -LRB- for I never thought it real -RRB- was founded upon in - stances of ingratitude and selfishness experienced at the hands of those from whom better could not have been expected .

		During the disagreement between him and his lady , the hubbub raised by the public reminded one of the mischievous boys who pretend to chase run - away horses , ' And roar , Stop , stop them !

		till they 're hoarse ; But mean to drive them faster . '

		Man and wife will hardly make the mutual sacrifices which are necessary to make them friends , when the whole public of
London	LOCATION	are hallooing about them . ''

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	's letters are naturally full of al - lusions to other contemporary authors , and we may allow ourselves one more extract an amusing note on
Jeffrey	PERSON	, who comes in for pretty frequent mention , kindlier mention , in - deed , than that caustic critic deserved at the hands of the author of `` Marmion . ''

		Writing to
Miss Seward	ORGANIZATION	in
1806	DATE	Sir
Walter	PERSON	says : '' I think were you to know my little friend
Jeffrey	PERSON	you would perhaps have some mercy on his criticisms ; not but that he often makes his best friends lose pa - tience by that love of severity which drives justice into tyranny : but , in fact , I have often wondered that a man who loves and admires poetry so much as he does can permit himself the severe , or sometimes unjust , strict - ures which he fulminates even against the authors whom he most approves of , and whose works actually afford him most delight .

		But what shall we say ?

		Many good-natured country Tories -LRB- myself , for example -RRB- take great pleasure in coursing and fishing , without any impeachment to their amiabilities , and probably
Jeffrey	PERSON	feels the same instinctive passion for hunting down the bards of the day .

		In common life the lion lies down with the lamb ; for not to mention his friendship for me , now of some standing , he had the magnanimity -LRB- ab - solutely approaching to chivalrous reliance upon the faith of a foe -RRB- to trust himself to
Southey	PERSON	's guidance in a boat on Winderinere , when it would have cost the poet nothing but a wet jacket to have overset the critic , and swum triumphantly to shore , and this the very day the review of <
Madoc	PERSON	' was published . ''

		In closing , we may say of these volumes , that they form in every way a desirable supplement to the great work of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's son-in-law .

		No one who values the one work can afford to leave the other unread .

		Indeed , we believe it may fairly be claimed for these Familiar Let - ters that they bring the reader a degree nearer the author of '' Waverley '' than either of their

		MR. SPENCER ON THE PRINCIPLES OF BENEFICENCE .

		* There is a touch of pathos in the avowal with which Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	introduces the last part of his Ethics , the conclusion of the great task to which the second half of his life has been con - secrated .

		Satisfaction in the achievement , he says , is somewhat dashed by disappointment at the meagreness of the ethical result . ''

		The
Doctrine of Evolution	ORGANIZATION	has not furnished guid - ance to the extent I had hoped . ''

		A successful life has been defined as a great thought conceived in youth and executed in ma - turity .

		But when the great thought assumes the form of a scheme of
Universal Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, the execution will inevitably fall short of the conception .

		The ambitious edifice will be structurally weak in places , and many of its chambers will be vacant or furnished only with casual or commonplace borrowings .

		Human thought , as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	warns us , vainly strains to '' swallow this universe , '' and where a hundred generations have failed the individual thinker will not succeed .

		Each man , now as in the days of Empedocles , really believes only in that on which he has chanced to alight ; and what - ever high-sounding titles he inscribes on the cover of his book , he can in the end tell us only of the little world of his own experience , exper - iment , and reading .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	conceived in his youth two great thoughts : his formula of an Evolution wide enough to include both astronomy and biology , and his conception -LRB- elaborated in the ''
Prin	PERSON	- ciples of Psychology '' -RRB- of life and mind as self - adjusting correspondence with the environment enforced by the death penalty .

		Even in his '' Psychology '' and '' Sociology '' these ambi - tious generalizations , though interpreted by in - genious analysis and illustrated by vast collec - tions of facts , failed to do justice to the infinite subtlety and diversity of nature .

		In ethics they are not merely inadequate , but positively misleading , owing to the distinctly anti-ethical associations that they necessarily convey to the majority of readers .

		The conception of life * THE PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS .

		and conduct as a gradual adjustment to the conditions of self-preservation is more harmful to sound ethical feeling than it can possibly be helpful to intellectual apprehension of the gen - eral conditions under which ethical and uneth - ical acts arise .

		The interpretation of our moral experience is not aided by such a formula as this : '' And along with this greater elaboration of life produced by the pursuit of more numer - ous ends , there goes that increased duration of life which is the supreme end . ''

		Eather must we say with Plato : '' To preserve himself such as he is , and to keep safe his possessions , is not the end and aim of the virtuous man .

		Sweet is this little life , but the true man will live well while he may ; how long or short he will permit to heaven . ''

		It is idle to reply that the one sentence is a bit of fine sentiment , the other a formulation of a scientific law .

		The ethics of evolution , too , must recognize the danger of what
George Eliot	PERSON	calls `` the hard , bold scrutiny of imperfect thought into obligations which can never be proved to have any sanctity in the absence of feeling . ''

		The moralist who writes , '' Death by starvation from inability to catch prey shows a falling short of conduct from its ideal , '' by his lack of humor and failure in literary tact encourages such imperfect thought far more than he can check it with all his science .

		A further cause of the inadequacy of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's treatment of ethics is to be found in the nature and limitations of his studies .

		They have not been those that qualify a man to deal with ethical problems in a sympathetic and illuminating way .

		For that , the humanistic and historic culture which he neglects is indispen - sable .

		Lastly , nearly all that he now has to tell us has been anticipated .

		During the long years of the postponement in which the unfin - ished structure of the '' Synthetic Philosophy '' has stood before us awaiting its ethical coping - stone , the special workers in this domain have not been idle .

		It was not difficult for them to prolong the lines in imagination , and make fairly accurate forecast of the completed edifice .

		The supplementary qualifications which the ethics of Evolution adds to the old Epicurean ethics of the utilitarian and associationist school have all been foreseen , and the issues thus raised with the opposing intuitionalist school in its various forms have been repeatedly debated .

		The highest point yet reached in the discussion is marked by Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's '' Science of Ethics '' and by his recent thoughtful reply to Professor Huxley 's brilliant but inconclusive 888 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 10	DATE	, Romanes Lecture .

		One turns with relief from the languid prolixity of the master to the trench - ant vigor of the disciple .

		But comparisons between inventor and perfector are invidious .

		The volume before us treats of beneficence , and begins by defining anew , with ponderous dialectic , the too-often neglected line of demar - cation between beneficence and justice , between things which are to be accepted as benefactions and things which may be claimed as rights .

		Justice aims to secure to every man the good or evil that naturally flows from his own acts , so far as this is compatible with the mainten - ance of social life .

		A secondary law of the highest social life requires that strict measures of justice be supplemented by spontaneous good - will .

		But this quality of mercy can not be strained , and its enforcement as a right wrongs the benefactor and weakens the moral fibre of the beneficiary .

		Beneficence is negative when it acts as a check on the unbridled use of our powers , positive when it prompts their active employment on behalf of others .

		With the aid of this somewhat artificial classification , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	propounds and discusses with ingenious naivete an immense number of special problems of casuistry .

		In business competition , for ex - ample , negative beneficence rebukes the conduct of '' a man named
Stewart	PERSON	'' who lived in
New York	LOCATION	and acquired a colossal fortune by the practice of suddenly lowering his prices to an unremunerative rate , '' seriously damaging nu - merous small traders . ''

		But it does not coun - tenance the claim of the trades-unions that only a '' scab '' will beat his fellows on a stint of work .

		Voluntary limitation of their field of activity by the successful lawyer or doctor pre - sents a more delicate problem ; for the welfare of society may require that the competent pro- fessional man should undertake all the work he can faithfully perform .

		Again , negative beneficence demands the voluntary relinquish - ments of the advantages of a hard contract , as it on the other side forbids the laborer 's striking when there is a big job on .

		It would restrain the pernicious activity of the soft-hearted woman who gives pence to the organ-grinder who makes day hideous to her philosophic neighbor , and it prohibits overpay ing of cabbies , and the tipping of guards , porters , and waiters , in order to obtain better than the average ser - vice .

		It imposes flashes of silence on the bril - liant conversationalist , will not permit a tennis player to beat a father whose son is watching the game , or a keen reasoner to expose a man 's fallacies '' if his fiancee is present . ''

		It softens censure , though not to the extent of altogether suppressing anger , which is frequently a moral and salutary feeling .

		And it also checks the impulse to bestow excessive praise , especially if the recipient is `` a handsome young lady accustomed to tribute in words and looks ... Shall you give her the pleasure she seeks by letting your glances be seen ?

		If you think only of proximate results , you may ; but not if you think also of remote results . ''

		The requirements of positive beneficence are elaborately discussed in relation to marriage , parenthood , kinship , aid to the helpless or sick , relief of the poor , etc. .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	still cher - ishes his fine fear of excessive altruism , but otherwise has little to add to the judgments of common-sense in these complicated matters .

		.

		The chapters on social and political benefi - cence are less languid in tone , and reveal some - thing of the old fire of the Essays . ''

		Benefi - cence tells no man to help in keeping up the movement of the social treadmill . '' ''

		Life is vitiated , '' especially , it would appear , for the bachelor , '' by making attractiveness of ap - pearance a primary end .

		Such is the expe - rience all through the day , from the first thing in the morning , when , while standing dripping wet , you have to separate the pretty fringes of the bath towel which are entangled with one another , to the last thing at night , when the boot-jack , which , not being an ornamental ob - ject , is put out of sight , has to be sought for . ''

		The silver butter-knife , we are told , is a typi - cal instance of a thing which has no raison d'etre save display .

		Pretentious funerals and wedding presents make life a burden .

		Man - kind waste their time in '' buying or producing pretty things so-called , which are mostly in the way . ''

		We smile to see the philosopher in his old age renewing his youthful tilt against social wind-mills .

		But no American can afford to smile at the sermon preached by Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	from the text , Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and good government .

		Political benefi - cence condemns the false sentiment of partisan loyalty which constrains a man to vote for a pernicious bill in order to '' put the other side in a hole . ''

		It will not hold guiltless the man of ability who withdraws himself from all con - cern in public affairs in order to make money or enjoy his leisure .

		Above all , the sense of public duty demands that we incur the odium of protesting against mismanagement and wrong - doing at all times and seasons , even where the immediate evil consequences can not be dis -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 cerned .

		Life is vitiated by just such trifles as the acceptance by a too complaisant inspec - tor of a bad road or an unsafe building , the passing by a gentlemanly examiner of a loose or inaccurate bank statement . ''

		Most men assume that things are going right until it is proved that they are going wrong ; whereas the as - sumption should be that things are going wrong till it is proved that they are going right . ''

		In the final chapter a word is said of the inspiring dream of a society so constituted as to render superfluous these precise prescriptions of a transitional ethics .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	wisely admonishes the socialist dreamers that they can - not colonize their Altrurias with any breed of man now existing on this planet .

		But after aeons of Evolution , he foresees a humanity that may realize the visions of Plato and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		This illusion will at least work no practical harm though perhaps here too the poet is wiser than the philosopher : '' Far away beyond her myriad coming changes earth will be Something other than the wildest modern dream of you or me . ''

		As the result of his researches among the Pueblo Indians , he submitted to the
Archaeological Institute of America	ORGANIZATION	, in
1881	DATE	, a `` Historical Introduction to Studies among the Sedentary Indians of
New Mexico	LOCATION	'' and a '' Report upon the Ruins of the Pueblo of Pecos . ''

		The following year he sub - mitted to the same Institute his report of '' An Archaeological Reconnoisance into
Mexico	LOCATION	, in the
year 1881	DATE	, '' which has since been published in a richly illustrated royal octavo volume of over three hundred pages , and has negatived the author 's own modest opinion of the popularity of his work by going to a second edition and sell - ing at
six dollars	MONEY	a volume .

		In
1885	DATE	he read an admirable paper before the
New York	LOCATION	Histor - ical Society on `` The Romantic School an Amer - ican Archaeology , '' published in a pamphlet .

		He was the official historical investigator of the

		The publication of his previous works had been controlled by the various societies to which he had reported ; '' The Delight Makers '' was prefaced and seen through the press by the author .

		The desire to correct the errors of ear - lier historians seems to be the principal stimu - lus of his own painstaking labors .

		From the present work it may be learned that El Dorado is not `` the golden land , '' as many suppose , but a contraction of El Hombre Dorado the gilded man .

		Although the basis of wildly ex - aggerated tales , El Hombre Dorado was an actual personage in aboriginal history , an In - dian chief in
South America	LOCATION	, whose body , in the course of a regularly recurring ceremonial , was covered with a resinous gum and then sprinkled with gold dust , which adhered until the chief bathed in a certain lake and thus completed the ceremonial .

		It was information of this that reached the European colonists of
South America	LOCATION	in the
sixteenth century	DATE	, excited their characteristic thirst for gold , and led to the disastrous expeditions in search of El Do - rado , narrated in the first four chapters of the book before us .

		The '' Other Pictures of the Spanish Occu - pancy of

		much that is interesting , much also that is fool - ish , and a few things that are simply deplora - ble .

		No student of Whitman or of American literature can afford to dispense with it , for it is rich in biographical and critical material ; yet its general tone of indiscriminating eulogy operates many times to make the judicious grieve .

		Walt Whitman 's figure is surely one of the most commanding in American litera - ture , yet its full stature will never be real - ized by the cultivated public at large , so long as the fanatical devotees of the poet 's memory continue to lavish their extravagant encomiums upon his faults and his virtues alike .

		In the very forefront of this volume , we come upon the following extremely uncritical -LRB- as well as unliterary -RRB- comment : `` Whitman had cosmic breadth and port .

		His ' Leaves ' foliage the heavens .

		He was so complicated with all men and all phenomena that his very voice partook of the sway of elemental integrity and candor .

		Nature has not shame nor vain glory , nor had he , and there was never a breath of distrust in his utterances from first to last .

		Absolutely candid , he was absolutely una - fraid . '

		Leaves of Grass ' has a tone peculiarly its own and strange in all the annals of literary crea - tion .

		Whitman speaks in it as would heaven , making unalterable announcements , oracular of the mysteries and powers that pervade and guide all life , all death , all purpose . ''

		The volume contains a good deal of this sad and turgid stuff , and to that extent does posi - tive injury to the memory whose claims it ad - vocates .

		In the way of memorabilia , we are given some notes from conversations with Mr.
George W. Whitman	PERSON	; Dr.
Bucke	PERSON	's remarks on '' The Man Walt Whitman '' ; Mr.
Sidney H. Morse	PERSON	's jottings on '' My Summer with - Walt Whit - man '' ; an account of the poet 's last sickness and death , by Mr.
Daniel LongakeF	PERSON	; the '' Last Days of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. W. Wal	PERSON	- lace ; and a number of papers by Mr.
Trau	PERSON	- bel , including the report of a '' round table '' symposium having Whitman for a central fig - ure , and an account of the poet 's funeral .

		All this matter is of value , although it might prof - itably have been pruned of many trivialities .

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's notes furnish an exceptionally in - teresting contribution to the study of the poet 's intimate personality .

		Of
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's own prose work we are given a number of examples .

		There are three re - views of his poems , written by himself many years ago , but never before published over his signature .

		They inform their readers , with many a flourish , that we have '' an American bard at last . ''

		They also proclaim that Amer -

		THE DIAL 391 ica is now to start an athletic and defiant lit - erature , that '' the interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent '' phrases which recall more recent pronuncia - mentos of the same sort , and which mean about as much as prospectuses of
Keeley	PERSON	motors or programmes of new religions .

		Whitman 's let - ters of
1873	DATE	, written , when sick at Washing - ton , to his mother , are of far more value than the anonymous effusions above mentioned ; they afford a simple and unaffected revelation of the man himself , when unconcerned with what he conceived to be his mission .

		A few further fragments of Whitman 's work are scattered through the volume , that called '' Immortality '' being the most important .

		Tributes to
Whitman	LOCATION	, critical and uncriti - cal , in prose and verse , occupy a considerable portion of the contents of this work .

		The terza rima poem on '' Love and Death , '' by
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, is the most impor - tant piece of verse , and thus apostrophizes the poet to whom it is incribed : `` Bard sublime , To whom the keys of mysteries are given , Throned in thine orb , fulfilling Space and
Time	ORGANIZATION	, Noting the world 's words with unerring ear !

		How shall I dare in this ephemeral rhyme To tell what thou hast taught me , to unsphere The new-born star , thy planet , the desire Of nations faltering in a night of fear , More marvellous than Phosphor or the fire Of Hesperus love-lorn , not less divine Than that first splendor from the angelic choir Flashed on poor shepherd-folk in Palestine ?

		Thou dost establish and our hearts receive New laws of Love to link and intertwine Majestic peoples ; Love to weld and weave Comrade to comrade , man to bearded man , Whereby indissoluble hosts shall cleave Unto the primal truths republican . ''

		Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	's estimate of Whitman , pub - lished by Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	in
1869	DATE	, is here reprinted , and was particularly deserving of preservation .

		There is an interesting but over - heated letter by
W. D. O'Connor	PERSON	, apropos of the Harlan episode , now printed for the first time .

		Mr.
R. G. Ingersoll	PERSON	's lecture on '' Lib - erty in Literature , '' delivered for Whitman 's benefit in
1890	DATE	, is given entire .

		It is , of course , more rhetorical than critical , and its eloquence is not more than second-rate ; but it has the sympathetic quality in abundant measure , and constitutes one of the more important features of the volume .

		A still more important feature is provided by the groups of critical articles translated from other languages .

		They include contribu - tions from the French of
M. Gabriel Sarrazin	PERSON	, the German of
Herren Karl Knortz	PERSON	and
T. W. Rolleston	PERSON	, and the Danish of
Herr Rudolf Schmidt	PERSON	.

		These
Continental	ORGANIZATION	tributes bring with them the broader outlook of criticism that assumes the world-standpoint , and naturally have much more to say about the poet 's thought than about the poet 's form .

		It is interesting to read
M. Sarrazin	PERSON	's translations from Whit - man .

		The poet seems , if anything , to gain by translation , a fact which recalls Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's explanation of
Byron	PERSON	's astonishing vogue upon the Continent .

		Even the magnifi - cent Lincoln monody -LRB- surely Whitman 's high - water mark as mere poetical expression -RRB- reads well in the French version . ''

Herr Rolleston	PERSON	makes a palpable hit when , speaking of the grossness beyond which many readers of Whitman refuse to let their vision take them , he says : '' Indecent , in my opin - ion , these poems are not ; but the criticism which universally selects them for discussion and condemnation is extremely indecent . ''

		Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	makes two contribu - tions to this collection .

		One , entitled ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	and the Common People , '' is the briefest of sketches .

		The other , ''
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man and His Recent Critics , '' is based upon a collection of newspaper clippings made soon after the death of the poet .

		The comment is not without humor , as may be seen from the following bit : '' The
New York	LOCATION	*
Herald	ORGANIZATION	' had said , ' He struck his lyre with his fist at times , instead of his finger-tips . '

		A Western editor hastened to say that was the best way to strike a liar . ''

		We regret to find in this article by Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	a passage so deplorable that it is simply amazing that he should have allowed it to be printed .

		The passage is this : '' The British press has first and last had its spiteful flings at
Whitman	LOCATION	, one of the latest at least , that of
Theodore Watts	PERSON	-LRB- whoever he be -RRB- in the ' Athenseum , ' betraying an aggressive specimen of the dirty thick - witted cockney blackguard .

		A cur is never more a cur than when -LSB- the words that follow are not of a quotable character -RSB- ; and did cockney criticism ever appear more currish and contemptible than when in the person of this man Watts it made haste to defame and dishonor the memory of our poet ? ''

		Upon the taste of these words there is no need to comment .

		Whatever the provocation , 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, or however obscure the critic , they would be indefensible .

		As for the suggestion implied by the phrase `` whoever he be , '' it can only pro- voke a smile .

		The first of living English critics and one of the first of living English poets is not thus to be disposed of .

		Suppose , to take a fairly analogous case , that some English writer had taken umbrage at one of
Lowell	LOCATION	's essays .

		He would hardly have strengthened his case by speaking of ''
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	-LRB- whoever he be -RRB- . ''

		Leaving this unpleasant subject , let us hasten to say that Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	has written thoughtfully and well of Whitman 's life and work : so well , indeed , that we can not better end this review of an exti'emely heterogenous volume than by quoting the closing passage of his longer contribution .

		`` The law of life of great poetry or great art is : he that would lose his life shall find it ; he that gives him - self the most freely shall the most freely receive .

		Whit - man merged himself in the thought , in the love , of his country and of his fellows ; he identified himself with all types and conditions of men ; he literally made him - self the brother and equal of all .

		He thought of himself only as he thought of others in and through himself .

		la his life he was guilty of no self-seeking ; he deliberately put by all that men usually strive for immediate suc - cess and applause , wealth , honors , family , friends that he might the more fully heed the voice from within .

		He chose the heroic part in his poetry and in his life . ''

		effect which criticism has had on religious organi - zations ; the reduction of cohesive force in churches .

		The
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	may be said to have been a tentative search , a plaintive cry , for more and wider unity .

		Are we departing from an or - ganic spiritual life , or drawing near it ?

		We can not answer this question till we see what is the true form and centre of unity .

		This centre is not to be found in any one church , in any organ - ization already achieved .

		The churches alike fall under existing criticism .

		The present separation of opinion has arisen under one wide protest against the various sects as a sufficient expression of the re - ligious life .

		We can not , then , be called on to select any one of these detached masses as the centre of a new movement .

		They are all condemned , though not equally condemned , as adequate expressions of the Divine Mind .

		Yet , is there not at this very moment more spir - itual unity if we mean by unity not an outward form but an inward force among men than ever before ?

		This unity is the unity of movement in one direction , under comprehensive and equivalent spiritual incentives , pushing all toward the truth .

		The divisive sectarian sentiments are simply the inertia offered to this impulse .

		A long , loosely-bound raft of logs threads its way slowly through the narrow and sinuous current of a sluggish stream .

		It readily coheres and quietly creeps on .

		At length a rapid is reached .

		The foremost logs are violently tossed and soon torn asunder .

		As each portion of the float approaches the centre of contention , it too dissolves away , till the river , far and near , is filled with single logs and single sections , all hurrying on under an energy each feels in a diverse degree .

		If unity means inward , adequate movement , then the unity is greater , not less , after than before the disruption .

		The unity of religious faith to-day is the unity of many men and many bodies of men responding in an unwonted degree to a truly divine energy that is hurrying them forward in the spiritual world .

		They are not yet ready to be bound up again in a single church , but when they shall coalesce it will be at a point far on toward the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the facts that indicate the rapidity of evo - lution in our time , hardly another is more startling than that so many books , charged to overflowing with one spiritual purpose , torching reverently and boldly the deepest facts in our religious life , should force themselves singly and in shoals on our atteu - | tion .

		Before me are a half-dozen volumes any one I of which would have been disturbing a score of years since .

		This is not less belief , it is more and deeper and wiser belief .

		`` Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy , '' by Dr.
Shedd	PERSON	, gives a milestone well back from which to measure our movement .

		Dr.
Shedd	PERSON	was a professor at An - dover in my seminary life .

		He was a man of marked ability and of a very lovable character .

		But he then seemed to me , and has always seemed , one born out of due time , thoroughly belated in the 18U3 .

		J THE DIAL 393 spiritual world .

		He is a man to be gratefully ac - cepted , but a fact not easily to be expounded on the basis of rationalism .

		His latest volume is made up of comparatively short excerpts from promiscuous addresses and articles bearing on the spiritual out - look of our time as taken from the extreme height of orthodoxy .

		Professor
Shedd	PERSON	's philosophy of re - ligious life is as simple and positive as that of the peasant who refers every difficulty directly to the devil .

		`` There is nothing new in the orthodoxy of to-day ; and nothing new in the newest heterodoxy . ''

		It is hardly worth while to have lived so long for so little .

		The professor thinks the `` infidelity '' of to-day characterized by the '' error , effrontery , and meanness '' of infidelity in all previous periods .

		In spite of my life-long veneration for this truly noble man , I must think that an orthodoxy which shows itself so completely unable to understand its own times , to profit them or to be profited by them , thereby stands thoroughly condemned .

		The pro- fessor 's earnest exhortation to courage , directed to the young men going forth from his instruction to encounter this unbelief , is such as might easily have come from a doughty old knight , who had not felt the sting of a bullet under his own corselet , urging novices in arms to meet boldly the new weapons .

		The second volume on our list , '' Theology of the Old Testament , '' by
Pastor Piepenbring	PERSON	, is a con - cise yet comprehensive work , presenting the gen - eral theory of interpretation which is associated with
Kuenen	PERSON	.

		The book is especially valuable because it does its task so independently and directly .

		It discusses the three periods ,
Mosaism	PERSON	, Prophetism , and Levitism , and sustains the discussion through - out by a very full reference to Scripture .

		The reader is thus in a position easily to judge the roundness of the method and the force of the argu - ment .

		It is a very helpful book .

		`` The Bible and its Theology , '' by Dr.
G. Vance Smith	PERSON	, is a work that lies in general tendency in the same direction as the last , but is very different in method .

		It pertains to the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	more than to the Old Testament .

		It discusses especially the religion which is embodied in the life and words of Christ and in the uses of Scripture .

		It attaches little importance to current dogmatic opinion . ''

		My one single and earnest wish in this volume has been to exhibit the teaching of the sacred books , on cer - tain great subjects of general interest , simply as I have found it . ''

		The author has very constantly in view some special point of controversy with Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	and others .

		As the style is clear and in - cisive , this raising of special difficulties tends to make the book not less interesting and v not less in - fluential .

		He puts the unity of faith in this form : '' Christianity , objectively considered , is Christ him - self the mind , life , character , and spirit of Christ . ''

		The work throughout rests on religious truths as addressed directly and independently to the reason of man . ''

		The Bible : Its Origin , Growth , and Character , '' by the Rev.
J. T. Sunderland	PERSON	, is a systematic and carefully complete presentation of the results of modern criticism , both in connection with the Old and the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Higher criticism , while still showing diversity of opinion in details , is becom - ing harmonious in its general view of the origin of the books of the
Bible	LOCATION	and of their authority .

		Our author gives us a concise and comprehensive pre - sentation of the sources of the several portions of Scripture , and discusses in full its authority and the service fulfilled by it .

		He gives the results of the last score of years of inquiry in the direction indi - cated by Wellhausen and
Kuenen	PERSON	.

		He says , in his preface , that he has endeavored to bring to his task a candid , catholic , and reverent spirit .

		The book sustains this affirmation .

		It is accompanied with a full bibliography . ''

		The
New Bible	LOCATION	and Its New Uses , '' by the Rev.
J. H. Crooker	PERSON	, is a book lying in much the same direction as the previous one without aiming to be as comprehensive .

		It answers the problems , What the
Bible	LOCATION	is , What it claims for itself , and What are its real uses .

		The results reacheorare those of the higher criticism .

		The author is scholarly , clear - minded , and very much in earnest .

		Such men are not only not to be feared , they give the light and promise of our day .

		The work is pervaded by so earnest and intelligent a temper as to be thoroughly readable and stimulating .

		`` Jesus and Modern Life , '' by the Rev.
M. J. Savage	PERSON	, is a series of discourses on the teachings of Christ .

		The general outlook is again that of the higher criticism .

		The book has in style a swing and a positiveness that belong to a popular preacher .

		The results of criticism are stated and accepted in a somewhat absolute form .

		The temper of the au - thor is excellent , and the aim of the book is to lead us back to the real centre of our faith the words of Christ .

		He presents these teachings at a variety of points .

		In the discourse on what Jesus taught about prayer , we find an example of the kind of conflict that has sprung up in many minds between phys - ical and spiritual law .

		Our ^ author is unwilling to accept the extension of prayer into the physical world .

		The two worlds are thus made to lie apart from each other in an impenetrable way .

		This con - ception seems to me inadmissible .

		The two halves of the world must be bound in closer , not less close , interlock , as thought advances .

		`` The Witness to Immortality , '' by the Rev.
George A. Gordon	PERSON	, is an extended and meditative renewal of the sentiments and insights which issue in the belief in immortality .

		The work is not framed as an argument .

		The two great items of faith , the being of God and immortality , can never be reached with the full force that belongs to them by the formal processes of proof .

		The premises from which these beliefs arise and by which they are constantly renewed and deepened are too com - prehensive , too emotional , too much a matter of personal experience , to admit of adequate state - ment .

		It is the entire drift of thought , rather than any one line of thought , that carries the mind over to 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, them .

		Appreciating this fact , our author seeks to renew , in a full and deliberate way , the feelings which issue in the belief in immortality .

		He pre - sents these sentiments in connection with the He - brew prophets , the poets , the philosophers , with
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, and with
Christ	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is fitted pleasur - ably to restore and deepen impressions already pres - ent .

		`` Natural Selection and Spiritual Freedom , '' by
Joseph John Murphy	PERSON	, is a series of not very closely connected discussions which show throughout a clear rational temper , associated with very positive belief .

		The immediate occasion of the work is found in the volume of Professor
Drummond	PERSON	, '' Natural Law in the'Spiritual World . ''

		The wide practical power of the author has given that book an influence that does not belong to it .

		In itself it is an unsuccess - ful combination of scientific notions and orthodox dogmas .

		There is no luminous coherence in it as a system of belief .

		This opening criticism leads Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	to 3 , wide discussion of the relation be - tween the physical and the spiritual worlds ; of the character of the analogies which lie between them and in each of them ; of natural selection in the spiritual world ; of future punishment and of moral freedom .

		These points are handled sagaciously by one whose mind responds directly to current reli - gious belief , to science , and to philosophy .

		The line of thought is thus vigorous and suggestive .

		The volume entitled `` The Spiritual Life '' is composed of six essays by as many different authors .

		Each treats of some portion of the history of the church in connection with mysticism .

		The recent devotional literature of
England	LOCATION	and of
America	LOCATION	constitute each a distinct part of the work .

		In this country ,
Channing	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	are accepted as leaders of that devout tendency which subordinates dogmas and rites to the inner expe - riences of faith .

		The mysticism discussed is sim - ply the predominance of the personal spiritual life over all its adjuncts .

		Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	says of Emerson : '' His temper is devout ; his habitual thought is spiritual ; his aim is ever toward holy living . ''

		The sketches are chiefly historical , but are also free in quotation .

		The indomitable belief implied in mysticism , asserting itself in the face of all destructive criticism , is a fact in the history of religion of which we are too little cognizant .

		Be - lief seems , at times , crumbling away before the manifold attacks to which it is subjected ; but here is a faith , and that of superior minds , which is un - touched by all assaults .

		Inscriptions here and there on a great monument may suffer some effacement , while the monument itself remains unmoved by the erosions of time .

		Such interior , invincible thoughts does mysticism disclose as belonging to our faith .

		`` Aspects of Theism , '' by Dr.
William Knight	PERSON	, is a vigorous rendering of an old theme .

		It is hardly worth while for one to re-state the argument for theism , unless he is possessed of a sound philosophy , a thorough comprehension of scientific methods , and a penetrating insight into the spiritual purposes that are now subserved by a belief in the being of God .

		Yet it is desirable that this argument should often be gone over .

		A new statement , in any meas - ure adequate , is sure to gather up some fresh im - pressions , and lead us , in our estimates of the nature and character of God , to a little different goal .

		Our conceptions of the nature of the Divine Being must be the fruit of many personal elements , must sweep in very varied experiences , and be for each mind , in a high degree , its own solution of last questions .

		It is not wise to expect that those who have faith should travel quite the same paths , or reach identi - cal conclusions , in theism .

		The discussion in the present volume is wide and penetrative , it encoun - ters the real difficulties of belief , and so will help many and give adequate guidance to a few .

		The work is especially full in its treatment of the per - sonality of God . ''

		There exists within the universe , as its latent essence , pervading it in all its phenom - enal life , a Principle which is also a
Force	ORGANIZATION	unfold - ing itself through law , a Power which reveals itself in life , and a Character which assumes a vast vari - ety of phases all of which are equally true and beautiful and good '' -LRB- p. 155 -RRB- .

		The author accepts an intuition of God a doctrine not easily conceded . ''

		It may be most fitly described as a direct gaze , by the inner eye of the spirit , into a region over which mists usually brood .

		The great and trans - cendent Reality , which it apprehends , lies evermore behind the veil of phenomena '' -LRB- p. 119 -RRB- .

		What can an intuition of this order give which is not phe - nomenal ?

		If it be phenomenal , what can the phe - nomena be ?

		If it be a conception , why is not that conception simply a rational product in view of just - ifying data ? ''

		Biblical Essays , '' by Bishop
Lightfoot	PERSON	, is made up of discussions , a few of which have appeared in periodicals , but most of which are put together from notes of lectures given at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The subjects are the authority of St.
John	PERSON	's gospel ,
Paul	PERSON	's pre - paration for the ministry , the chronology of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's life and epistles , the churches of
Macedonia	LOCATION	, the church of
Thessalonica	LOCATION	, the Mission of Titus to the
Corinthians	LOCATION	, the structure and distination of the epistle to the Romans , the distination of the epistle to the Ephesians , the date of the pastoral epistles ,
Paul	PERSON	's history after the close of the Acts .

		The dis - cussions are characterized by a full , candid , and adequate treatment .

		Bishop
Lightfoot	PERSON	was con - servative in his tendency , but in no way disposed to belittle objections , evade them , or bear them down .

		One finds in a work of this sort the very grave satisfaction of feeling that our current histor - ical convictions are by no means so accidental and ill-grounded as the facile criticism of a few bold minds is wont to imply .

		A good deal of criticism virtually destroys itself by the ease with which it sets aside accepted opinions , and transforms the his - torical field into a region of loose conjecture .

		This volume can be heartily recommended as combining , in a high degree , a cautious temper with liberal scholarship .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		1893 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		n. Messrs.
Doclcl	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's handsome edition of Maxime de la Rocheterie 's '' Life of Marie An - toinette '' -LRB- well translated by
Cora Hamilton Bell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should prove one of the most popular publications of the season .

		M. de la
Rocheterie	ORGANIZATION	's book is a mas - terpiece in its way a rare combination of brilliant , warmly - sympathetic portrayal , with candid and impartial criticism .

		The book is not for one mo - ment to be confounded with the mass of flimsy and deleterious trash which has been written concerning this period of French history .


Marie Antoinette	PERSON	has suffered about equally from unmerited praise and unmerited aspersion .

		Her critics have painted her as angel or as demon , according to their own bias .

		It has remained for M. de la Rocheterie to paint her as woman ; and , happily , he has not for - gotten that absolute truth of portraiture is perfectly compatible with the graceful brush and the brilliant setting .

		Nowhere else , in short , is this sad episode in a chapter at once the brightest and the darkest in the world 's history brightest as to its benign ideals , ` and darkest as to its means and methods so fascinatingly and so impartially told .

		The wri - ter 's present estimate of this heroine does not dif - fer from that formerly expresssdin reviewing `` The Correspondence of the Comte de Mercy with
Maria Theresa	PERSON	'' : ''
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	was not a sinner , neither was she a saint .

		She was a pure and charm - ing woman , somewhat heedless and frivolous , but always chaste ; a queen somewhat too hot-headed in the patronage she bestowed , and inconsiderate in her political actions , but proud and energetic ; a true queen , by reason of the dignity of her bearing and the splendor of her majesty ; a true woman , in virtue of the seductiveness of her manners and the tenderness of her heart , till she became a martyr , through the extremity of her trials and her trium - phant death . ''

		The material features of the book also call for commendation .

		Print and paper are good , the twenty portraits are acceptably done , and the cover is quiet and tasteful .

		There is also a sumptuous large-paper edition .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a spick and span new edition of that old-time favorite and rol - licking picture of
English University	ORGANIZATION	life forty years back , `` The Adventures of Verdant Green , '' by
Cuthbert Bede	PERSON	.

		The book was vastly popular in its day -LRB- over 150,000 copies have been sold -RRB- , and we are a little curious to learn how it will strike the present public .

		If one is to implicitly believe the author -LRB- which we doubt -RRB- ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	life at the period treated was a wild hurly-burly of carousing , hazing , cricketing , boating , steeple-chasing , rat-baiting , town-and-gown rows , etc. , with a very mild season - ing of the classics thrown in , while the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	under - graduate was a sorry -LRB- if amusing -RRB- scamp , usually of the type of Lever 's ''
Frank Webber	PERSON	'' or Thack - eray 's `` Foker . ''

		Some of
Bede	ORGANIZATION	's characters are almost classic , in their small way , as '' Mr.
Boun	PERSON	- cer , '' `` Gig-lamps '' himself , `` Mr.
Blades	PERSON	, '' `` Four - in-hand Fosbrooke , '' and last but not least `` the
Putney	LOCATION	Pet '' Who that has read it -LRB- as a boy -RRB- can forget
Bede	PERSON	's epic description of the great town-and - gown battle , and the prodigies of valor performed therein by this battered hero of the '' P. R. '' - deeds not unworthy of
Diomede	PERSON	and
Ajax Telamon	ORGANIZATION	!

		Recalling them , one is almost inclined to agree with Mr.
Besant	PERSON	that '' The decay of boxing during the last twenty-five years has been certainly followed by a great decay of the national pluck and pugnacity , and therefore , naturally , by a decay of national en - terprise . ''

		Therefore exclaims Mr.
Besant	PERSON	, fired by memories of the palmy days of
Spring	DATE	and
Broughton	PERSON	, of `` Tom ``
Sayers	PERSON	and `` Jem ''
Belcher	PERSON	`` the bravest of the brave '' `` let all our boys be taught to fight !

		let there be no nonsense listened to about brutality .

		The world belongs to the men who can fight . ''

		We fancy we hear a pavid chorus of maternal dissent from this eminently
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	monition ; but the monitor is more than half right .

		The boy who '' takes the wall '' at school is usually father of the man who keeps it through life .

		The new edition of the '' Verdant Green '' books is a very attractive one , with its bright , clear print , showy bindings of green and gold , and with all the original mirth-provoking illustrations . ''


Inigo Jones	PERSON	and
Wren	PERSON	; or , The Rise and De - cline of Modern Architecture in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , a handsomely-appointed quarto , by Mr.
W. J. Loftie	PERSON	, is written , says the author , not for archi - tects , but in the earnest hope that it may reach some of those by whom architects are employed .

		Our examination of the book , however , leads us to think the professional architect will find both text and illustrations of very considerable interest , despite the fact that Mr.
Loftie	PERSON	has avoided the pedantry of talking obscurely and learnedly about triglyphs , drops , modillions , architraves , entablatures , etc. , in a work meant to be intelligible to the lay reader .

		As the title implies , the work treats of the style of architecture practiced by
Jones	PERSON	and
Wren	PERSON	; and to this kind the author applies the term `` Palladian , '' which he prefers to the only other possible word `` renascence or renaissance , '' as being more defi - nite .

		The influence of the style , Mr.
Loftie	PERSON	thinks , was nowhere more marked than in
England	LOCATION	, where it was adopted -LRB- chiefly through the publication in
1570	DATE	of
Palladio	ORGANIZATION	's book -RRB- as representing classical or learned , as distinguished from Gothic , art .

		The book is agreeably and intelligently written , present - ing matter that is of great interest to the profes - sional reader in a style not beyond the capacity of ordinarily well-read mortals .

		A feature of the work is the illustrations .

		These are mainly from cuts published during the golden age of English Palla - dian ; but there are many fine photographic views , especially of the beautiful buildings of the transi - tional period found in the western counties , where the Bath stone furnishes a relatively plastic vehicle for the expression of sentiment in building .

		Partisans of the penny-whistle order of fiction 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, assure us that ''
Scott	PERSON	has gone out of fashion . ''

		A great many good things have gone out of fashion -LRB- and it is no less cheerful than wonderful to note how surely and overpoweringly they come in again -RRB- , but the dictum about
Scott	PERSON	does not seem to be well founded .

		It is not borne out , certainly , by the ap - pearance of
Messrs. Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	's fine new Holiday edition -LRB- in two volumes -RRB- of `` Ivanhoe , '' a copy of which is now before us .

		The book is soberly yet richly bound , and it contains twenty full - page illustrations , handsomely printed on light vel - lum paper .

		These are about equally divided in sub - ject between illustrative plates proper , representing scenes and characters of the story , and photographic views of `` Ivanhoe '' scenery the latter class being , in our judgment , the more successful .

		The editor is , of course -LRB- why say it ? -RRB-

		the omnipresent and pro- tean
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; and this recalls an unknown poet 's recent plaint that '' Over every mortal thing 's The spoor of
Andrew Lang	PERSON	. ''

		Even this angry bard must , however , admit the modest way in which his enemy has here performed what Macaulay calls '' the humblest of literary of - fices . ''

		He has furnished , it is true , an Introduction of some sixteen pages ; but he sticks to his book and his author , and is phenomenally forgetful throughout of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		He tells how '' Ivanhoe '' was written , discusses the story in some detail , an - swers pedantic objections to its historical and archa3 - ological slips , and presents , in closing , some inter - esting extracts from contemporary reviews .

		To Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's talk of the `` nonsense of ` Ivanhoe , ' the in - credibly opportune appearances of
Locksley	LOCATION	, the death of
Ulrica	LOCATION	, the resuscitation of Athelstane , as partly boyish , partly feverish , '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	rather feebly replies , `` Perhaps Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was never a boy '' ; which answer is a pretty fair case of Ignor - atio elenchi .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	himself admitted that the Athelstane resurrection was '' a botch . ''

		To our thinking , a critical Introduction which deals with and therefore suggests to the mind of the reader all sorts of pettifogging objections is not just the best appetizer for a romance like `` Ivanhoe . ''

		One should go to such books fresh and unsophisticated , ready and anxious to be deluded and befogged to any ex - tent ; but Mr.
Lang	PERSON	had his task assigned him , and he has done it precisely as it should be done .

		The English tourist has always contributed freely to the gayety of continental nations , but the author of '' Across
France	LOCATION	in a Caravan '' -LRB-
Randolph	PERSON	-RRB- seems to have rather outdone his predecessors in liberality .

		The book embodies the story of a trip , a la Mrs.
Jar	PERSON	- ley , from
Bordeaux	LOCATION	across
France	LOCATION	and the
Riviera	LOCATION	in one of those lumbering four-wheeled vehicles , half house , half wagon , affected by
Gipsy	LOCATION	tinkers and peripatetic photographers .

		This '' caravan '' had been named by her former owner -LRB- a man of strong fancy -RRB- the '' Hirondelle . ''

		But as the '' Hi - rondelle '' weighed over two tons , and had never in her speediest swallow-flights been known to make over two miles an hour , her new owner concluded to re-christen her the '' Escargot . ''

		The crew of the `` Escargot '' consisted at the start of the author , his patient and Jong-suffering wife , and a collie dog Avhich seems to have enacted the role of an uncom - monly captious first-cabin passenger .

		Essentially , the narrative is the '' Escargot 's '' log .

		The story is amusingly told , and the little party made so light of their mishaps and so much of their windfalls , and had , on the whole , such a jolly , wholesome , happy - go-lucky , novel sort of time of it that the reader feels half inclined , on closing the book , to eschew
Pullman	PERSON	cars for the future , and to take to the '' car - avan '' himself .

		The author 's account of a French sportsman is diverting : '' Just before we reached Finhan we met a gentleman attired in all his glory of hunting-cap , velvet coat , top-boots , French horn , network gamebag , and gun , and enough dogs to make up a respectable pack of beagles , which they very strongly resembled .

		AVe were wondering what he could have come out to shoot .

		To our minds it could n't be anything less than a wild boar , but he very soon satisfied our doubts by suddenly turning aside off the road , throwing himself onto one knee with his gun at the present , and , after taking delib - erate aim of quite two minutes , blazing away into a flock of sparrows who were feeding on the ground . ''

		The volume is gotten up in approved Christmas style , and the illustrations , after sketches by the au - thor , add much to the humor of the text .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons reprint in attrac - tive style
Julia Kavanagh	PERSON	's '' Woman in
France	LOCATION	during the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' a work which at least attests its author 's copious reading .

		Unhap - pily , Mrs.
Kavanagh	PERSON	starts out with what may be called the vindicatory tone .

		She proposes to vindi - cate the claim of her sex to having exercised some influence on French affairs in the eighteenth cent - ury or , to put it another way , to having been then , and a fortiori now , an integral and efficient part of the human race .

		The proposition does not seem , on the whole , a difficult one ; and we are always at a loss , when we hear it advanced , to know when or by whom it was ever controverted .

		Man , we know on episcopal authority , `` is vile . ''

		Besides , he is notoriously prejudiced against a sex to which his mother and sisters belong , and from which he must perforce choose his wife .

		But we doubt if he is unreasonable enough to deny that woman has been , time out of mind , a potential factor in the progress and the propagation of the human race .

		We get a little weary sometimes of this gratuitous clatter over the question as to the comparative efficiency of the sexes .

		Why not argue , by way of a change , as to which blade of a pair of scissors does the more cutting ?

		Mrs.
Kavanagh	PERSON	's work is superficial , but it is chatty and anecdotal enough , and the portraits on steel and other embellishments bestowed upon it by the publishers make it an alluring gift-book .

		Outwardly similar to the work just noticed is the Messrs.
Putnams	PERSON	' new two-volume edition of Fran -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 ces
Elliot	PERSON	's lengthy historical romance , '' Old Court Life in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		The tale is laid in the sixteenth century , and the author has aimed , as she says , to work into her dialogue `` each word and sentence recorded of the individual , every available trait of character to be found in contemporary memoirs , every tradition that has come down to us . ''

		Ob - viously , such a method does not admit of much play of imagination , and is eminently conducive to scrap - piness .

		As a historical picture the story is of some interest , and it forms an excellent basis for the many and interesting illustrations , mostly portraits , contained in the present edition .

		These have been reprinted from the plates in
Miss Pardoe	LOCATION	's '' Me - moirs of the French Court . ''

		Very neat and serviceable is Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's compact edition , in two volumes , of the `` Journal of Eugenie de Gudrin . ''

		To speak of Mdlle .

		de Gudrin is to recall
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, who , in praising her , quite forgot what Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	called his `` jury-addressing manner , '' and warmed into something like Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's own munificence .

		Eu - ge `` nie de Gue ` rin , says Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	, was '' the most devoted of sisters , one of the rarest and most beau - tiful of souls ... Her soul had the same charac - teristic quality as her brother 's talent distinction .

		Of this quality the world is impatient ; it chafes against it , rails at it , insults it , hates it ; it ends by receiving its influence , and by undergoing its law ... To the circle of spirits marked by this rare quality ,
Maurice	PERSON	and Euge * nie de Gue ` rin be - long ; they will take their place in the sky which these inhabit , and shine close to one another , lucida sidera . ''

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's estimate of Mdlle .

		de Gue ` rin was doubtless warmed and heightened by his inter - est in her touching story .

		The '' Journal '' -LRB- written for her brother 's eye alone -RRB- remains , however , one of the few examples in literature of frank self-dis - closure ; and as such , if for no other quality , it de - serves to live .

		Mrs.
Alfred Gatty	PERSON	's '' Parables from Nature '' are issued in two rather pleasing volumes by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mrs.
Gatty	PERSON	's productions will doubtless always find readers ; but we confess to some doubt as to the precise class of them she means to address whether adults or children .

		The teach - ing of the `` Parables '' seems a little too elementary for '' grown-ups , '' while the language in which it is couched must baffle the intellectuals of any child short of an infant phenomenon .

		The text is well printed on lightly-glazed paper , and M. de Long - pr ^ 's drawings are so graceful and pleasing as to make one wish there were more of them .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's neat and inexpen - sive edition of `` The Abbs ' Constantin '' -LRB- Handy - Volume Classics -RRB- bids fair to score '' a palpable hit . ''

		It is nicely printed and bound , and contains a great number of text illustrations , in half-tone , by Made - leine
Lemaire	PERSON	, with a frontispiece and ornamental title-page in photogravure .

		Those who already have M. HaleVy 's classic tale in the large and sumptuous editions , which are meant to be looked at , will be glad to find it in this pretty and portable volume , which is meant to be read .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons add to their excel - lent series of Representative Novels
Frederika Bre	PERSON	- mer 's `` The Home ; or , Life in
Sweden	LOCATION	, '' in
Mary Howitt	PERSON	's standard translation .

		The work is in two shapely 16mo volumes , and the good paper , bright new type , and neat exterior should assist materially in rehabilitating this prime favorite of near half a century ago .

		A seasonable gift-book and an approved compila - tion is Mr.
Louis K. Harlow	PERSON	's '' The World 's Best Hymns '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Harlow	PERSON	also furnishes the illustrations a number of pretty landscape sketches , in which he has aimed to reflect the mood and sentiment of the accompanying verses .

		The collection is a book of hymns , rather than a hymn-book ; and Mr.
Harlow	PERSON	has tried to include in it '' the best English lyrical poetry that has been immediately associated with sacred music , and hal - lowed by long and constant use in the service of song in the home and the church . ''

		Few of the old favorites will be missed , and hymns by
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	are included , by permission of the publishers .

		The black-letter titles and rubricated initials have a good decorative effect .

		The small quarto volume entitled '' Pictures from Nature and Life '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- contains a collection of poems by
Kate Raworth Holmes	PERSON	, copiously illus - trated by
Helen E. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The illustrations to the opening poem , which describes a day 's outing in ''
Merrie England	PERSON	, '' are apt and effective , with one unfortunate exception .

		The final plate , repre - senting an everyday young man posing for his por - trait in a sack coat and an exasperatingly senti - mental attitude , coming as it does after the dreamy bits of English landscape , views of hallowed histor - ical sites and memorials , etc. , savors a little of pic - torial bathos .

		Perhaps the young man meets the exigencies of the text ; but we think he could be spared .

		Notably graceful and natural are the sprays and nosegays of leaves and blossoms strewn through - out the pages .

		The ever-popular `` Lucille '' makes its periodical appearance , this time in imperial 8vo , and resplend - ent in a cover of white vellum-cloth decorated with rich tracery and medallions in gilt , red , and blue .

		-LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text is largely and clearly printed on rather thick paper , and there are a goodly num - ber of illustrations , partly illustrative drawings , and partly photographic views of scenery , works of art .

		etc. , touched upon in or suggested by the text .

		The volume is showy without being tawdry , and it should attract attention .

		Mr.
William Trumbull	PERSON	's romantic poem .

		`` The Legend of the White Canoe '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , profusely illustrated in photogravure from the designs of
F. V. Du Mond	ORGANIZATION	, forms a sufficiently striking presenta - tion volume .

		The poem is based on the tradition touching an old custom of the Indian tribes of 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Western New York	LOCATION	to assemble on certain occasions at
Niagara	LOCATION	and offer sacrifice to the Spirit of the Falls .

		`` The sacrifice , '' explains Mr.
Trumbull	PERSON	, '' consisted of a white birch-bark canoe , which was sent over the terrible cliff , filled with ripe fruits and blooming flowers , and bearing the fairest girl in the tribe who had just attained the age of womanhood . ''

		We may add that in the poem which ensues mat - ters are reversed , and it is the girl , not the canoe , that plays the leading role .

		Mr.
Trumbull	PERSON	' s verse is rather above the average of its class , and as much may be said of Mr.
Du Mond	PERSON	's drawings .

		In the middle of the last century the King 's Li - brary at
London	LOCATION	had sixty-three editions of Thomas i ,
Kempis	PERSON	's '' The Imitation of Christ , '' including translations into eight languages .

		The number of editions has increased considerably since then ; and
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	now add their quota in the shape of a dainty 18mo that should prove a delight to pious souls .

		It is illustrated with fifteen drawings depicting scenes in the life of
Christ	LOCATION	, by
H. Hofman	PERSON	, Director of the
Royal Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	at
Dresden	LOCATION	.

		`` Helpful Words '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is the truthful and sufficiently explanatory title of a sheaf of monitory passages from the writings of
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		They are compiled by
Mary B. Merrill	PERSON	; and each extract is faced by a drawing by
F. T. Merrill	PERSON	, whose designs , though slight , are apt and pleasing .

		The little booklet is prettily bound in white and gold . ''

		Christmas Carols '' -LRB-
Thomas Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , a comely booklet suggestive of old-fashioned Christ - mas cheer and observances , contains the words of the three fine carols , `` In the field with their flocks abiding , '' `` In sorrow and in want , '' and `` All jubi - lant with psalm and hymn '' each with two photo - gravure plates of the
Madonna and Child	ORGANIZATION	, after well - known originals .

		The Carols are printed by per - mission of
Canon Farrar	ORGANIZATION	, who will doubtless be pleased to see them so satisfactorily mounted .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a new edition of '' Picciola , '' in form generally similar to their `` Co - lette '' and '' An Attic Philosopher '' of the past two seasons .

		Since M. `` Saintine '' -LRB- or rather
M. Joseph Xavier Boniface	PERSON	-RRB- won , in
1837	DATE	, the Mon - tyon prize of 3,000 fr .

		for his pretty and touching tale it has gone on reproducing itself , so to speak , at a marvellous rate .

		In
1861	DATE	it reached a thirty - seventh edition ; and since then there have been probably half a score more .

		One has only to read `` Picciola '' to learn the secret of its surprising vi - tality .

		The publishers have made , in some res - pects , a pretty volume ; but candor compels us to say that
J. F. Gueldry	PERSON	's drawings are sad produc - tions .

		Emerson observed of
Bryant	PERSON	that he has so con - trived to levy on all American nature that there is no feature of day or night in the country which does not , to a contemplative mind , recall his name .

		This is certainly putting the case pretty strongly though we fancy , indeed , that there are at least few people upon whom the sight of the fringed gentian or of a waterfowl does not have the effect indicated .

		Bryant loved nature and painted her accurately , as many of the selections in
Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Poems of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, by
William Cullen Bry	PERSON	- ant '' attest .

		The volume is of the ornate class , and it is profusely illustrated by
Paul de Longpre	ORGANIZATION	'' .

		Some of
M. de Longpre	ORGANIZATION	`` s drawings , as the sheaf of golden-rod on page 45 and the dainty vignette to `` Robert of Lincoln '' on page 88 , are pretty and graceful ; but there is a tendency to over-elabora - tion which in work of the kind always means stiffness .

		M. de Longpr ^ 's slighter drawings are invariably the happier .

		As a collection , the volume is an excellent one .

		There are forty-five poems in all , beginning with the fine lines '' To a Waterfowl '' and ending with `` Our Fellow - Worshippers . ''

		One of the daintiest of Holiday souvenirs is a reprint of
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's '' Proverbs in Porcelain , '' from the press of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , with twenty-four illustrations and ornamental vig - nettes by
Bernard Partridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Proverbs '' were first published in
1877	DATE	, and to them is now added the '' dramatic vignettes '' `` Au Hevoir , '' from '' At the Sign of the Lyre . ''

		The quality of Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's airy little studies is already known to our readers , and it only remains for us to commend Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	's extremely clever and vigorous draw - ings a thought too vigorous , perhaps , for their del - icate setting .

		The intrinsic merit and fair exterior of the new and modified edition of
Redgrave	PERSON	's standard `` A Century of Painters of the English School '' -LRB- im - ported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , combine to make it a desira - ble gift-book .

		The work was first issued in
1865	DATE	; and in preparing the present edition some abridge - ments have been made with a view of making it a more suitable and convenient manual for art stu - dents and amateurs .

		The merits of Mr.
Redgrave	PERSON	's book , and his own exceptional qualification as a historian of British art are too well established to need comment .

		There are a number of wood-cuts of varying merit ; and the futile strivings of British art in the direction of '' the Grand Style '' are strik - ingly exemplified by the plates after
Northcote	PERSON	and
Haydon	PERSON	and , we regret to add ,
Reynolds	PERSON	.

		Why the gracious Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, the painter , par excellence , of
England	LOCATION	's charming women and children , should be represented in a history of English painting by his vapid and ww-representative '' Head of a Ban - ished Lord '' passeth understanding .

		Gainsborough fares better .

		His `` The Cottage Door '' forms a lovely frontispiece .

		The following , much to our regret , reached us too late for anything beyond an enumeration in the present category : ''
Rembrandt	PERSON	, his Life , his Work , and his Time , '' from the French of
Emile Michel	PERSON	, by
Florence Simmonds	PERSON	, published by Messrs.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons ;
Frederick D. Thompson	PERSON	's '' In the Track of the Sun '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- ;
Edwin A. Barber	PERSON	's `` Pot -
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 399 tery and Porcelain of the United States '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- ; Messrs.
Porter & Coates	PERSON	's two-volume edition of
Blackmore	PERSON	's ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' ; `` Some Artists at the Fair '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- ; `` Humorous Poems by Hood , '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , illustrated by
C. E. Brock	PERSON	; and '' Gyp - sying beyond the Sea '' -LRB-
Randolph	PERSON	-RRB- , two volumes of travel-sketches .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		ii . ''

		My Dark Companions and their Strange Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is from no less famous a pen than that of
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	.

		The hook is a collection of legends and folk-tales related at different times by the dark companions of his travels , as they sat about the camp - fire after a long day 's march .

		The stories possess a kind of primeval freshness and originality .

		They are often picturesque , sometimes weird , occasionally humorous .

		The first legend , which gives an account of the creation of man , offers a very ingenious explanation of the pres - ence of sin in the world .

		When the earth lay awaiting the coming of life , its sole inhabitant was a great ugly toad .

		The moon and the toad each wished to have the honor of creating man .

		The toad accomplished his pur - pose first , producing an ugly , ill-formed , degraded crea - ture ; and when the work was finished , the toad died .

		The moon did all she could to repair the error by re - moulding the creature , and succeeded in giving him a fairer form and a more enlightened mind ; but do what she would , there was left in his soul the stain from the hand of his creator .

		Such stories render the book scarcely less interesting to the folk-lore enthusiast than to the children for whom it is primarily intended .

		`` Westward with
Columbus	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is still an - other tribute to the greatness of the Genoese explorer , in which the author , Mr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	,
R. N.	PERSON	, seeks to present in story form a rather detailed account of the life of the great mariner from the beginning to the close .

		The work is done in an appreciative way , with a manifest reverence for the greatness of the hero , and an unmis - takable ring of earnestness about it .

		It is , however , to be regretted that what is in many respects a charming book should be marred by the occasional use of a forced and stilted style .

		The mechanical neatness of the vol - ume is to be commended , and the illustrations by Mr.
Alfred Pease	PERSON	are good .

		Mrs.
Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	has , in her book entitled ''
Paul Jones	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , entered a field which is com - paratively new to this form of tillage .

		The work is avow - edly a romance , but the figure of our gallant first Commo - dore is one that readily lends itself to fiction , the sim - plest account of facts of his life reading like the most exciting novel .

		Our boys and girls can not become too familiar with the character of this brave , dashing , yet gentle and kindly man .

		Mrs.
Seawell	PERSON	is obviously a hero-worshipper , but she has chosen her hero so judi - ciously and tells his story so acceptably that her little book should be given a hearty welcome .

		A book of interest to older readers as well as young is Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	's '' Famous Voyagers and Ex - plorers '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It consists of eight sketches of men who have given their lives to increase the sum of human knowledge .

		The lives of
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Marco Polo	PERSON	,
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, Sir
John Franklin	PERSON	and other Arctic explorers , Dr.
Livingston	PERSON	, and Commo - dore
Perry	PERSON	are given in a clear , sympathetic , enthu - siastic way , the salient points in the history of each be - ing made prominent , while the whole series forms a narrative of events very stirring and inspiring in them - selves .

		The book is well illustrated with portraits of the famous men described .

		The loss of a galleon laden with gold from
Mexico	LOCATION	, and its discovery more than three centuries later after having been turned into a veritable ship of coral by the indus - try of the tiny inhabitants of the sea , is the basis of a story by Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	, entitled The Coral Ship '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The adventures of the three boys cast away on a lonely island , their discovery of the sunken ship , their efforts to recover the treasure , and their final rescue will make entertaining and exciting read - ing for any boy .

		As in all of Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	's works , the style is crisp and spirited .

		In Rodney the Overseer '' -LRB-
Porter & Coates	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Harry Castlemon	PERSON	continues a series of war stories in which the scene of action is
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		An interesting and politically instructive phase of the great struggle between
the North and South	ORGANIZATION	is told with vigor and fairness . ''

		In a New World '' -LRB-
Porter & Coates	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Horatio Alger , Jr.	PERSON	, continues the narration of the adventures of an American boy , and takes him with a companion to the gold fields of
Australia	LOCATION	in search of a fortune , which , after adventures with bushrangers , struggles with pov - erty , and disappointments , they find in the shape of a phenomenally large nugget .

		`` Half - Hours with Jimmieboy '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	, will afford many a half-hour 's pleasant diversion to the busy little men who seem al - ways to need '' some new thing . ''

		The astonishing ad - ventures which overtake this youthful hero in the Land of Nod are recounted with a sympathetic appreciation of a child 's fantastic imagination .

		The idea of the Bieyclopsedia Bird will delight any fun-loving child be - cause of its supreme absurdity .

		The various stories are very acceptably illustrated by several artists .

		In his search for material for a young folks ' book , Mr.
D. O. S. Lowell	PERSON	has left the modern work-a-day world and gone back to the inexhaustible mine of Greek mythology , giving as a result of his labors a little volume entitled ''
Jason	PERSON	's Quest '' -LRB-
Leach , Sewell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In it he has undertaken the task of giving this and a few other Greek myths a fit setting for young readers ; and he has succeeded better than many of those who have attempted similar feats , for he gives the stories with truthfulness and poetic feeling .

		He has been careful not to permit too many parallel myths to appear , thus escaping a fruitful source of failure ; as too great a pro- fusion of details tends inevitably to confuse and bewilder the mind of a child .

		Mr.
C. W. Reed	PERSON	has illustrated the book with several spirited drawings .

		Of quite a different sort is the book by Miss
Margaret Miller	PERSON	, `` My
Saturday	DATE	Bird Class '' -LRB- Heath -RRB- .

		As the author says in her preface , she seeks to induce others to interest children in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and especially in birds .

		Teachers will find the little book useful , through the concise information concerning different bird families , which is appended to each chapter .

		The chapter on ''
Billy Wren	PERSON	's Housekeeping , '' which has appeared be - fore , is especially sweet and attractive .

		Somewhat similar in purpose is the little volume of ; uneful rhymes by
Mary Howitt	PERSON	, entitled '' Sketches of Natural History '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer certainly pos - 400 -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, sesses a strong love for nature and a comprehension of its beauties .

		The habits and haunts of animals , birds , and insects are described in a very pleasing style .

		Oc - casionally a bit of philosophy is introduced rather beyond the comprehension of a child , but it is as an undercurrent , and does not materially mar the effect .

		The many en - gravings , from drawings by
H. Giacomelli	PERSON	, have the hio-h merit which we wish all illustrations for children 's books might possess .


Mary E. Bamford	PERSON	, the author of `` Talks by Queer Folks '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , certainly brings to her task an en - thusiastic love of nature .

		As in her previous work , she has chosen a very pleasant way of teaching the charac - teristics and habits of well-known animals and insects .

		They are made to speak for themselves , and in a very chatty and friendly way tell of their own virtues and the faults of their friends .

		Many Indian and Oriental legends connected with them in the past are related in the book .

		In the complicated process of a child 's education his sense of humor should not be neglected .

		For this rea - son , any book should be welcomed which in a clever way rises above the dead level of commonplace serious - ness and appeals to this side of his nature . ''

		Odd Busi - ness '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Lewis Bridgman	PERSON	, is such a book , replete with fun and fancy .

		A short series of mock advertisements , which give the book its name , form a laughable collection of jingling rhymes and startling puns , but its most charming feature is the col - lection of little stories dealing with the mischievous In - dian fairies , the Puk-Wudjies mentioned by
Longfellow	LOCATION	in `` Hiawatha . ''

		They have about them the untram - melled freedom of the forest , and are as dainty and fan - tastic as could be wished .

		The sketches accompanying them are capital ; indeed , the illustrations throughout the book show artistic feeling as well as a keen sense of humor .

		Boys are not much addicted to reading essays , but if any who are old enough to grasp some of the problems of life chance to look into the pages of the little volume called '' The Sunny Days of Youth '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- they will find plenty to repay them .

		This is a collection of essays full of common-sense and good advice for boys and young men , enlivened by stories and humorous an - ecdotes .

		The exterior of the book is pleasing , and it may well form a part of any boy 's library .

		A sweet little story of childish faith and its triumph is told by
Miss A. G. Plympton	PERSON	in ''
Robin	PERSON	's Recruit '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .


Robin	PERSON	is the little sou of a captain in the ariny stationed at a frontier post , who takes a childish fancy to a roug ; h soldier of whom everyone else expects only ill .

		The little fellow 's confidence and affection shame the man whose past life has been a long chapter of wrong-doing , partly the result of the careless heart - lessness of his fellows .

		He at last plans to desert ; but the thought of his little friend holds him back .

		The next day there is a fire which threatens the lives of the whole garrison .

		The rough soldier is the means of sav - ing the fort , but loses his own life .

		The story is told with interest and feeling , and teaches a forcible lesson , though it never preaches . ''


Stephen Mitchell	PERSON	's Journey '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story from the pen of the indefatigable Mrs.
Alden	PERSON	, who writes , as usual , with an earnest purpose .

		The picture she draws of the hero a rough , uncouth , unawakeued lad , listening to a lecture by some famous preacher and won - dering if he can be speaking English , so strange it all sounds , is full of tragic significance .

		The story hinges upon the efforts of a young minister and his sister to bring the civilizing influence of a practical Christianity to bear upon the family of a poor and ignorant farmer .

		Unlike Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	's other books this year , '' The White Cave '' -LRB- The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deals with a subject not at all historical .

		He takes his readers far away to the wilderness or '' bush '' of
Australia	LOCATION	, and gives them enough excitement to satisfy the wildest desire of any boyish heart .

		The adventures crowd thick and fast ; one hair-breadth escape follows another .

		The whole is a bewildering melange of English gentry lost in the woods , of bushrangers , wild black men , and for - est wolves .

		On the whole , the work savors a little too much of sensationalism to be entirely wholesome .


Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	's story of '' The Little Mer - maid , '' with a few '' Other Stories '' added , comes in the form of a charming gift-book from the
Putnam Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translator , Mr.
R. Nesbit Bain	PERSON	, gives a biographical sketch of his author , together with a rather disparaging criticism of previous English translations of his work .

		For his own version , it must be said that his English is simple and strong , and that he catches the quaint humor which is one of the chief charms of this children 's friend .

		The volume is very dainty as to its cover ; and the drawings by Mr.
J. R. Weguelin	PERSON	are de - lightful .

		The dedication of Mr.
John Barry	PERSON	's little tale of '' The Princess Margarethe '' -LRB-
Allen	PERSON	-RRB- `` To all little girls who wish to be princesses '' tells its purpose very fairly .

		The story is a very sad one , being an account of the un - happiness of a little princess during her short life of five years .

		She is neglected by her ambitious parents , who can not forgive her for being a girl ; and she is left to her dreams and her fancies , which are often full of poetry .

		The little volume appears in a very attractive form .

		Two very dainty little volumes appear in the '' Chil - dren 's Favorite Classics Series '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Both are reprints one , of the ever astonishing '' Adventures of Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' ; the other , '' The Adventures of a Brownie , '' a delightful bit of nonsense , by Miss Mu - lock .

		The illustrations of the two volumes , with the exception of the two ill-fitting prints that serve as fron - tispieces , are very clever .

		A sober little volume in russet binding , written and well illustrated by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, is called '' The Country School '' -LRB- Appletou -RRB- .

		Schooliife in the coun - try when the century was young , and also that of the present time , are portrayed with sympathetic fidelity .

		The hardships and the simple pleasures , the punish - ments and rewards , the quaint customs and primitive methods , are all pictured with graphic touches . ''


Woodie Thorpe	PERSON	's Pilgrimage '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of short stories by Mr.
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	, whose stories always show that he understands boy character and knows how to delineate it .

		His boys are healthful energetic youngsters , with plenty of spirit and adventure .

		The present volume is perhaps not quite up to his usual standard , though there are a number of wide-awake boys and many interesting happenings in it .

		Genuine American boy-life is depicted by Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	in the two juvenile books he offers this year , ''
Jack Hall	PERSON	'' and ''
Jack	PERSON	in the Bush '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Jack is not by any means perfect ; he gets into numberless scrapes , but is so manly and frank through it all that he can be forgiven .

		The first of the two volumes is a story of a boy 's life at a large boarding-school ; and the descriptions of baseball and rowing contests will delight
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		401 the soul of any fun-loving boy . ''

		Jack in the
Bush	PERSON	'' takes the same hero , with five comrades and two older friends , into the wilds of the
Maine	LOCATION	woods .

		The moral atmosphere of both books is fresh and pure , and several useful lessons are unobtrusively taught .

		Somewhat out of the usual field of romance lies the region of ice and snow claimed by the
Esquimaux	LOCATION	; but it is into this land of doubtful promise that Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- lantyne has penetrated , and he has brought back a tale which he calls `` The Walrus Hunters '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		His wish in writing it , as defined in his short prefatory note , is to urge the abandonment of war and the estab - lishing of more peaceful relations between nations .

		The characters of the book are so far removed from common experience that the lesson is perhaps the more willingly accepted .

		There are a number of ex - citing encounters between the Esquimaux and their neighbors the Dogrib Indians ; and the romance wrought from the lives of an Esquimaux youth and a Dogrib maiden is quite poetic in its simplicity .

		Mr.
Henry Willard French	PERSON	, in ``
Oscar Peterson	PERSON	, Ranchman and Ranger '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , takes for his theme life in the Far West in the earlier and rougher days .

		It seems a wildly improbable and wholly useless nar - rative .

		Additional stories for boys , for which we have space left for hardly more than an enumeration , are ``
John Boyd	PERSON	's Adventures '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a story of a sailor - boy 's life at the beginning of the century , by
Thomas Knox	PERSON	; '' The Wreck of the Golden Fleece '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , written by
Robert Leighton	PERSON	, and possessing a well-laid plot vigorously handled ; `` Marking the Boundary '' -LRB-
Price-McGill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
E. E. Billings	PERSON	; `` Schooldays in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Andre ''
Laurie	PERSON	; `` Through Apache Land '' -LRB-
Price-McGill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Lieutenant
Jayne	PERSON	; '' The Romance of a Schoolboy '' -LRB-
Price-McGill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Mary A. Denison	PERSON	; and '' Childhood Days , '' a simple and effective little story of pioneer life in
Tennessee	LOCATION	, by
Sarah E. Morrison	PERSON	.

		The books avowedly for girls are very much in the minority this season .

		Though these few possess usu - ally the right flavor , we regret to say that if our girls confined their attention to the books written especially for them they would be much the losers .

		Fortunately , however , many of the very best juveniles are as good for girls as for boys .

		Miss
Anna Chapin	PERSON	Ray 's ''
Margaret Davis	PERSON	, Tutor '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is one of the most delightful girls ' books that the season offers .

		Miss Ray 's style often reminds one of Miss
Alcott	PERSON	's unerring judgment as to what will suit young folks .

		The conversations are clever and bright , and the life of the young tutor and her charges is a very engaging one .

		The love-episode is not unduly forced into prominence , and its modest treatment adds another charm to what is really a very fresh and invig - orating book .

		Like the voice of an old friend to the many girls whose hearts warm at the name of
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	will come the `` Comic Tragedies '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , written by Jo and
Meg	PERSON	, '' and acted by '' The Little Women . ''

		This is a collection of six plays written and acted by
Miss Alcott	PERSON	and her sisters when they were girls at home forty years ago .

		Though full of fantastic senti - ment , overstrained feeling , and absurd situations , these youthful effusions show the play of a very lively imag - ination and a sparkle of dramatic fire . ''

		Ingleside '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , with
Barbara Yechtou	PERSON	's uaine on the title-page , has about it an atmosphere as sweet and pure as that of the old garden beside the mansion which gives the story its name .

		The theme reconcil - iation through the love of a child is an old one , but
Miss Yechton	LOCATION	has not let it lose any of its freshness .

		The dear little maiden , with her quaint name ,
Theodosia	LOCATION	, is very sweet and winsome as she tries to forget her homesickness when left alone with her stern grand-aunt .

		The drawing which
Jessie McDermott	PERSON	has made of the little maid , arrayed in one of her grandmother 's gowns , is very fascinating .

		A collection of nine stories for girls , entitled '' The Barberry Bush '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , comes from Miss
Susan Coolidge	PERSON	.

		They are all bright and entertaining sketches of girl life , the one which gives the book its name be - ing perhaps the best .

		Besides her story for boys , Mrs.
Alden	PERSON	has this year a little volume for girls which includes a number of short stories entitled `` Worth Having '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- .

		Each one has a very marked lesson to teach , '' In the Great Walled Country '' being by far the best . ''


Jenny Wren	PERSON	's
Boarding House	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, tells of the efforts of a poor young girl to keep a boarding-house for newsboys .

		The boys themselves are the directors and managers , and their business efforts are often as absurd as those of their elders . ''

		The Children 's Year Book '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is an extens - ive collection of quotations from the
Bible	LOCATION	and from the writings of famous men , carefully selected by Miss
Edith Emerson Forbes	PERSON	.

		They seem a little beyond the comprehension of the readers aimed at , yet children will often catch the beauty of a simple thought .

		`` A Question of Honor '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Lynde Palmer	PERSON	, is a book to interest both boys and girls .

		It deals with a question of business morals , and works out the solution in the mind of the hero on the line that
Emerson	PERSON	takes when he speaks of changing one 's '' mar - ket-cart for a chariot of the sun . ''

		There is no false sentiment in the book ; nothing but stern truth , and just treatment of it .

		For very little folk but few books are offered this year .

		We may mention `` Ruby 's
Ups	ORGANIZATION	and Downs '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Minnie Paull	PERSON	, which seems to point a moral with undue clearness ; `` Little Ones ' Annual '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and '' Twenty Little Maid - ens '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	.

		A few other books for children must be dismissed with a word of mention . ''

		The Child 's Day Book '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , by ''
Margaret Sidney	PERSON	, '' gives prayers and verses for each day of the week , and has five full-page colored inserts . ''

		Chatterbox '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , which is always with us , appears as varied and attractive as ever in the volume for this year .

		The bound volume for
1893	DATE	of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Young People '' needs no word of praise ; it is full of good things , and the best of all is the frontis - piece , Mr.
Kruell	PERSON	's engraving from a photograph of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	has put his ac - quaintance with the
New York	LOCATION	slums to good purpose in ''
Nibsy	ORGANIZATION	's Christmas '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a collection of three stories for children , dedicated , for her charitable activ - ities , to the Queen of
Denmark	LOCATION	. ''

		Under the Nursery Lamp '' -LRB-
Randolph	PERSON	-RRB- is a collection of verses by various hands , having childhood for their subject , and illus - trated by photogravures ; most of the pieces are un - named , but among the others we note verses by Messrs.
Dobsou	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Two exquisite little gift-books , 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, boxed together , are '' Memoirs of a
London	LOCATION	Doll '' and '' The Doll and Her Friends '' -LRB- Brentano -RRB- , by Mrs.
Fair	PERSON	- star , who wishes '' to say a word in favor of that good old-fashioned plaything , the doll '' ; the illustrations are by Mr.
Frank M. Gregory	PERSON	. ''

		Witch Winnie in
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written in the fresh and breezy style of its author , Mrs.
E. W. Champney	PERSON	. ''

		Elsie at Ion '' is the nineteenth volume in
Martha Finley	PERSON	's '' El - sie Books '' series , issued by the same publishers .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
December 3 , 1893	DATE	.

		It is a far cry from
New York	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and the proof-reader 's insertion of the latter city 's name be - fore '' Examiner , '' in my last letter , apparently trans - ferred my friend , Mr.
Henry C. Vedder	PERSON	, the whole dis - tance in one breathless leap .

		I say '' apparently , '' be - cause everybody knows that the '' Examiner '' is the leading Baptist weekly in the country and is published here in
New York	LOCATION	.

		No , Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	is still managing editor of the '' Examiner , '' and has no present intention of leaving that periodical for the '' San Francisco Ex - aminer '' or any other daily newspaper .

		The series of essays which he has been printing on '' Living American Writers '' has , then , appeared in the '' Examiner '' of this city and there only .

		Mention of a religious weekly reminds me how numerous and how ably edited this class of periodicals is in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The '' Independ - ent '' and the '' Outlook '' -LRB- formerly '' Christian Union '' -RRB- seem to take the lead from a literary point of view , but the '' Observer , '' the '' Churchman , '' the '' Examiner , '' and the '' Evangelist , '' although more sectarian in char - acter , follow the others very closely .

		The '' Christian at Work '' publishes its '' annual literary number '' this week , containing a number of interesting articles , not - ably one on the history and personnel of our leading publishing firms , by Mr.
Henry W. Domett	PERSON	.

		Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	's death calls to mind his close rela - tions with the firm of
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who introduced his works in this country , and have since remained his American publishers .

		He was also an intimate friend and correspondent of the late Professor
Edward L. Youmans	PERSON	, founder and so long editor of the '' Popu - lar Science Monthly . ''

		When Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	came over , in
1872	DATE	, to deliver his lectures on the phenom - ena and laws of light , it will be remembered , he de - clined to profit by the venture . ''

		I will not lecture for the sake of money , '' he said , '' nor would I bring away a dollar of the proceeds of my labor . ''

		All the receipts above actual expenses were put in the hands of three trustees , the interest of the fund to be used for the as - sistance of such young men as desired to devote them - selves to original scientific study and research .

		The plan did not work very well , however ; it was hard to reach desirable beneficiaries , and so , in
1885	DATE	, with Pro- fessor
Tyndall	PERSON	's consent , the fund which had meanwhile increased from
$ 13,000	MONEY	to
$ 32,000	MONEY	was applied to the founding of scholarships in physical science at Har - vard ,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		This final disposition was arranged by Mr.
William W. Appleton	PERSON	, who has kindly permitted me to make ex - tracts from two or three of Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	's letters to Professor
Youmans	PERSON	.

		When lecturing in
Boston	LOCATION	, the former wrote : `` The lectures are going on , but they are difficult .

		The people crowd to hear them , and Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	declares that never previously were they held so fast in the lecture-room .

		I give them an hour and a half , though warned that they would not stand more than an hour ... Go on and prosper , my dear
Youmans	PERSON	, in the work you have un - dertaken .

		I hardly know any man in
Europe	LOCATION	or Amer - ica who enjoys your opportunity of doing good , and the best of it is that it is an opportunity created by your - self . ''

		-LRB- This refers to the '' International Science Series . '' -RRB-

		Again , after his return to
England	LOCATION	, Professor
Tyn	PERSON	- dall wrote : `` I have just time to say that before this week ends a revised copy of the
Belfast Address	ORGANIZATION	shall be on its way to you .

		It has caused a tremendous com - motion .

		How foolish they are !

		... Cardinal
Cullen	PERSON	has just appointed three days of prayer to keep infidel - ity out of
Ireland	LOCATION	! ''

		-LRB- The address had been denounced as a declaration of materialism . -RRB-

		Mr.
Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	, with
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has summed up
Tyndall	PERSON	's character for THE DIAL in a few well-chosen words as follows : `` Personally ,
Tyn	PERSON	- dall was very modest , quiet and reserved , and a hater of notoriety .

		When he was lecturing in this country he refused many invitations and was sometimes considered unduly reserved .

		Among his friends , however , he was very genial and entertaining ; and he was the life of the little club of scientists in
London	LOCATION	, to which he belonged in company with
Spencer	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and others .

		He was devoted to science , to the exclusion of most outside dis - tractions except the society of his close friends , although in later years he naturally took an active interest in the administration of scientific departments of the English government . ''

		I learn from
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	that Miss
Constance Fenimore Woolson	PERSON	has given up her house at
Bellosguardo	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and has taken an old palace at
San Gregorio	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	, which city she now intends making her home for several years .

		This will be a genuine disappointment to Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's friends , who have understood that she contemplated an early return to
America	LOCATION	.

		Her new novel , ''
Horace Chase	PERSON	, '' which has been running in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly , '' will be pub - lished in book form early in the new year .

		Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	have just brought out the first volume of '' Ora - tions and Addresses '' by
George William Curtis	PERSON	.

		There will be three of these handsome octavos , and a fourth volume of the same author 's '' Essays . ''

		The firm had succeeded in interesting Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	in this project only a short time before his death , he considering his speeches on public occasions too ephemeral for preservation .

		Those ' who were fortunate enough to hear his remarks at the dinner in honor of the passing of the
International Copyright Bill	ORGANIZATION	, or indeed any of his more notable ad - dresses , will look for these volumes with interest .

		The same firm has also just issued Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's `` The Rulers of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, '' compiled from his articles in the '' Weekly . ''

		It is characteristic of the period that when Mr.
Davis	PERSON	sailed from
New York	LOCATION	in search of the material for this book , he had as a fellow-passenger Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	, of the ''
Evan	PERSON	- gelist , '' who was also bent on obtaining matter for a similar volume .

		Dr. Field 's letters appeared in the '' Evangelist , '' and , as already announced in
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL , are published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	as '' The
Barbary Coast	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		To cap the climax and end this merry compe - tition , the books came out on the same day this week .

		One of the most interesting announcements for the new year is the early publication by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	of the authorized '' Life '' of Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, by
Rowland E. Prothero	PERSON	, late Fellow of All Souls ' College ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
1893	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 doubly interesting on account of Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	's having just accepted the editorship of the '' Quarterly Review . ''

		It is pleasant for all who met that eager and lovable young Englishman ,
Gleeson White	PERSON	, during his year 's editorship of an art journal in this city , to learn that the
London	LOCATION	'' Studio '' is achieving such a marked suc - cess under his management .

		Mr.
Gleesou White	PERSON	is also editing the new '' Ex Libris '' series , of which two vol - umes have already appeared , `` Printers ' Marks '' by
W. Roberts	PERSON	, and '' English Book-PIates '' by
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		A third is just announced , the `` Little Passion '' of Al - bert
Diirer	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		As to books for book lovers , editions de luxe , etc. , printed in this country , I have been much impressed in recent letters from English friends to find frequent mention of - the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	, or the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	, say you ?

		no , indeed , Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		He stirred up the younger English `` illuminati '' mightily with his beautiful reproductions of Meredith 's '' Modern Love '' and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's '' City of
Dreadful Night	ORGANIZATION	, '' for which , I remember , Mrs.
Cavazza	PERSON	wrote the `` forewords . ''

		Now he is bringing out a lovely little '' Bibelot Series , '' as all may know by his advertisements ; but what all may not know is that he has had the title-pages of the two anthologies already issued , '' Old World Lyrics '' and '' Songs of Adieu , '' specially cut after the style of the Aldines .

		He got this idea from reading
Pollard	PERSON	's '' Last Words on the His - tory of the Title-page . ''

		There is much of interest to chronicle , but I suppose the reviews of Christmas books will not permit a long letter .

		I can not help referring to the amusing adver - tisement of a publisher in an English literary weekly .

		A long list of books by more than one nobody in partic - ular is given , while underneath the whole is a notice to the effect that '' Authors -LRB- known and unknown -RRB- desirous of having their Works published to the best advantage should communicate with , ,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Publishers , - St. '' What a dreadful slaughter of innocents !

		We do this thing more discreetly in the '' States , '' bearing in mind the advice of good Master
Isaak Walton	PERSON	, who tells us how to impale Master Froggy upou a hook for our bait , and who advises us , in so doing , to '' use him as though yon loved him , that is , harm him as little as you may possibly , that he may live the longer . ''

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES AND
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce an abridged school edition of ''
Ekkehard	PERSON	, '' edited by Miss
Carla Wenckebach	PERSON	. ''

		The
Midland Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, '' a new monthly , to be ed - ited by Mr.
Johnson Brigham	PERSON	, is announced for early publication at
Des Moines	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	has just published '' The Genus Salpa , '' a comprehensive monograph by Professor
W. K. Brooks	PERSON	.

		The work is in two volumes , one of them containing fifty-seven colored plates .


Madame Taine	ORGANIZATION	is said to be correcting the proofs of the last instalment of her lamented husband 's `` Origines de la
France	LOCATION	Contemporaine , '' the volume dealing with the clergy , which was left nearly finished at the author 's death .

		The
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	announces '' The Redemption of the Brahman , '' by Professor
Garbe	PERSON	, of
Konigsberg	PERSON	, who was a delegate to the
Philological Congress	ORGANIZATION	held in
Chicago	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	.

		The book is a philosophical novel .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce '' Pain , Pleasure , aud ^ Esthetics , '' by Mr.
H. R. Marshall	PERSON	; '' Mental De - velopment in the Child and the Race , '' by Prof.
J. M. Baldwin	PERSON	; and a volume of lectures on modern mathe - matics , by Professor
Felix Klein	PERSON	.

		On the
19th of next April	DATE	the
Concord	LOCATION	anniversary a Latin play will be given by
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	students in the college theatre .

		The '' Phormio '' of
Terence	PERSON	has been chosen , and music has been written by Prof.
F. D. Allen	PERSON	.

		Professor
Greenough	PERSON	has written a prologue , and the libretto is now being printed at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		As we surmised , in our recent mention of '' My Friend the Murderer , '' the volume turns out to have been a collection of early stories and sketches .

		We now learn that they were republished without the author 's sanction , and Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	has issued a card of protest against the '' enterprise '' which has thus misrepresented him .

		Mrs.
Edwina Booth Grossmann	PERSON	, the daughter of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, is writing some reminiscences of her father , and requests his friends who possess letters from him to send her transcripts of such as they may wish to add to her publication .

		They should be addressed to Mrs.
Ignatius R. Grossmann	PERSON	, 12 West 18th Street ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		To the list of biographies of Confederate generals will soon be added a life of
General Polk	ORGANIZATION	, written by his son , Dr.
William Polk	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, and to be pub - lished by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work will contain a full account of Folk 's labors as Bishop of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, of his founding the
University	ORGANIZATION	at
Sewanee	LOCATION	, and his actions in the war till his death on the field of battle .

		It will be illustrated with portraits and with original maps and battle plans .

		The recent reduction of nearly one-half in the price of '' The Forum '' is doubly gratifying .

		It is fortunate that this excellent review should be brought so much nearer the reach of the public , and it is pleasant to think that public appreciation of its value should already have placed it in a position to make the reduction pos - sible . ''

		The Forum '' has steadily improved in quality during the past two or three years , and our only quar - rel with it is that its articles are not always long enough to give adequate treatment to their subjects . ''

		Social England , '' a work in six volumes , edited by Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	, but written by many hands , will soon be published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The work has been primarily designed , the editor states , '' to supply a clear and consecutive account of the progress of the people of
England	LOCATION	in the several departments and activities of human life .

		The subjects considered have been so framed and the material so arranged that the work can be read with pleasure and instruction by the general reader interested simply in the wonderful story unfolded by it , while it has been planned expressly with reference to the requirements of students engaged in the investigation of the history of English letters and learning , English art and science , English industry and commerce . ''

		Messrs.
George H. Richmond & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, an - nounce for immediate publication '' Fadette , '' translated from the French of George Sand by Miss
Jane Minot Sedgwick	PERSON	, with an etched frontispiece by Mr.
E. Abot	PERSON	.

		It will be remembered that '' La Petite Fadette '' has been dramatized under the title of '' Fan - chon the Cricket . ''

		The same publishers have in pre - paration , uniform with '' Fadette , '' a series of George Sand 's novels , to be translated by
Miss Sedgwick	PERSON	.

		They are also the Amer - ican publishers of Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's Poems ; Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	's '' Salome ' '' -LRB- Englished edition -RRB- , with illustrations by Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	; and the '' Hobby Horse . ''

		It may interest the curious to know that the publisher 's device to be used by this firm is combined from those used by
William Copeland	PERSON	and
Richard Day	PERSON	, both noted English printers of the
XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		century Day 's father being
John Daye	PERSON	, royal printer to '' Bloody Mary . '' ''

		Exhibitions '' of famous authors are now the fashion in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We have mentioned , during the past year , the
Dante	PERSON	and Shelley '' exhibitions '' held in
London	LOCATION	, and now have to chronicle a '' Faust-Ausstellung '' at
Frankfurt	LOCATION	, in the very house where Goethe was born .

		Its object is to show the influence of the Faust legend on the intellectual life of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with the historical
Faust	PERSON	, the development of the legend is traced by contemporary accounts , including the various versions , native and foreign , of the Faustbiicher .

		The collection includes a vast number of programmes of
Marlowe	PERSON	's '' Dr. Faustus '' as well as of
