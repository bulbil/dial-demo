A V77*AL HISTORICAL WORK 

The German Element in 
the United States 

By ALBERT BERNHARDT FAUST 

Assistant Professor of German in Cornell University 

An\important historical work of great popular interest to many readers. 

THE first volume deals with the history of the Germans in this country from the earliest times 
to the present. Beginning with an account of the first Germans who came to America with 
Leif Ericson in the 11th century, Professor Faust carries the narrative down through the founding 
of Germantown and the large German immigration to New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
Virginia, and South Carolina in the early 18th century, to the notable part played by them in 
the pushing out of the Western frontier, and in the wars of the 19th century, e. g., War of 1812, 
Mexican War. Civil War, and Spanish War. He concludes with a general summary of German 
immigration through the 19th century, and an account of the location, distribution and general 
character of the immigrants. This volume is based upon the re-examination of a vast amount 
of material and draws likewise upon numerous sources hitherto unstudied. It is well arranged 
and thoroughly documented, yet it is so full of picturesque detail and illustrative anecdote that it 
is readable from start to finish. 

The second volume makes a searching analysis of the influence of the German element in 
our American civilization, and traces in the most interesting way the influence of the Germans on 
the material development of our country in both agriculture and manufacture, upon our political 
institutions, education and social life, and music, literature, and the drama, and the important part 
played by prominent Germans of to-day. 

The book is lavishly illustrated with maps, portraits of eminent German-Americans, both 
pioneers and contemporaries, facsimiles of important documents and historical scenes. 

In short, the work is the first to deal exhaustively with this important 
subject, and will be indispensable for historical scholars, and of great value 
and interest for the general reader, while its appeal to readers of German 
birth will be unique.

PHILOSOPHIC DOUBTS CONCERNING 
CR ITICI SM. 

Public life in England has one happy char- 
acteristic which has not been developed to any 
considerable degree in our own country. It 
does call to its posts of leadership and responsi- 
bility men of intellectual distinction — men who 
have already made their mark, or who are by 
way of making their mark, in other and less tur- 
bulent fields than those of politics. Men of 
the type of Lord Morley, Mr. Haldane, Mr. 
Birrell, and Mr. Balfour rise to high positions 
despite their possession of that fine culture which 
would be to them an almost insuperable barrier 
in this country. Try to imagine, for example, 
Mr. William James, or Mr. Howells, or the late 
Mr. Gilder, as members of the national legisla- 
ture, and you have a concrete illustration of this 
fundamental difference between the two coun- 
tries. On the other hand, try to imagine 
Speaker Cannon dashing off a little thing on 
aesthetics, or Senator Aldrich acquiring meta- 
physical fame (on any other subject than that 
of the tariff) in his hours of studious retirement, 
and another illustration of the same negative 
sort is provided. The scholar is indeed rara 
avis in the American politics of to-day, and the 
most frequently mentioned example is one of 
whom we are not exactly proud. 

In England it is different — so different that 
when, for example, the Oxford authorities wished 
to name the Romanes lecturer for the present 
year, they naturally turned to the graceful and 
subtle philosopher who is the present leader of 
the Opposition in the House of Commons. Mr. 
Balfour's address, as given in the Sheldonian 
Theatre about a month ago, now lies before us, 
and has for its title " Questionings on Criticism 
and Beauty." Mr. Balfour is an adept at ques- 
tioning, and the pale cast of his thought, when 
directed toward the subject of aesthetic criticism, 
forces him into his favorite attitude of philo- 
sophic doubt. 

" The amount of splendid literary and other artistic 
work which has been produced since the revival of 
learning is the glory of our modern civilization. The 
amount of intellectual energy which has been thrown 
into the criticism of literature and of art is very great, 
and yet I think that anybody who has studied that criti- 
cism cannot but feel profoundly depressed by the char- 
acter of its total output. In the course of your survey 
you will come upon the names of men whose critical 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



labours have made them immortal ; but if you ask what 
they have done, you will usually find that what they have 
done is to sweep away the rubbish of their critical pre- 
decessors; you will usually find that where they have 
failed is in not having made that drastic process of 
purgation sufficiently complete." 

This is sad if true, and a melancholy commen- 
tary upon the futility of all human endeavor to 
create a philosophy of the beautiful ; for it 
follows that our own most admired modern 
judgments (Mr. Balfour's included) will in time 
go into the rubbish heap, to be succeeded by 
new and equally unstable appreciations. 

But we cannot believe the situation to be 
really as bad as all this, in spite of skeptics like 
Mr. Balfour, or subjectivists like M. Anatole 
France, or iconoclasts like Mr. G. B. Shaw, or 
aesthetic agnostics like Count Tolstoy. How- 
ever such men may rail at the pedantry of the 
critics, or deny the gift of real vision to the in- 
terpreters of literature, or deplore the sophisti- 
cation that befogs their judgment, there remains 
a very definite canon of the beautiful which has 
been beaten into shape amid the warring of 
schools, the clashing of critical temperaments, 
and the shifting of points of view. We know 
pretty definitely, and can make fairly clear the 
reasons, why Sophocles was a greater poet than 
Euripides, and Goethe than Schiller, and Tenny- 
son than Browning. As individuals we may 
make grievous mistakes about our contempora- 
ries, but as students of the history of literature 
we accept the registered verdicts, primarily be- 
cause they are reasonable, and the consider- 
ations that support them have the clear signs of 
validity. 

After all, Mr. Balfour saves himself from the 
extreme lengths of skepticism, as usual, by his 
qualifications and reservations. He may assert 
that " nobody lays down rules now," and that 
" rules of correct composition are buried among 
lumber of the past," but he also admits that 
" superficially at all events there is a very great 
appearance of unanimity, in this eclectic age, as 
to what is or what is not a successful work of 
art." " Are we to take as a test," he asks, 
"the feelings of men of trained sensibility? 
Are we to take, if that is true, the man who has 
cultivated a particular art, and acquainted him- 
self with its technique, its principles, its history, 
and studied it and cultivated it? And if we 
take him shall we attain to anything in the 
nature of an agreement as to what truly consti- 
tutes excellence in artistic production?" If 
Mr. Balfour really wishes us to answer these 
questions he is welcome to our decided affirma- 



tive. But he is not more than half sincere in 
asking them, for he goes on to cite certain noto- 
rious eccentricities of judgment (on the part of 
Arnold and Kuskin) as things that " we hush 
up as quickly as we can," and to say that " on 
the whole, cultured persons show a tolerably 
united front to their enemies." This is pretty 
nearly conceding the whole point of Mr. Bal- 
four's questionings, unless one goes over bag and 
baggage to the Tolstoyan camp, and holds the 
untutored hind the only truly competent juror in 
matters aesthetic. And this our author, although 
he toys with the notion, is not quite prepared 
to do. 

The plea that beauty is its own excuse for 
being, needing no further exposition or justifi- 
cation, will never fully satisfy the mind that 
seeks an essential part of its happiness in learn- 
ing the causes of things. To stand upon that 
proposition alone is to plant one's feet upon a 
quicksand, to cast one's mind adrift from all its 
moorings. A man convinced of the proposition 
would still have to ignore it in practice, just as 
the convinced determinist cannot help assuming 
himself to be a free agent. Mr. Balfour rather 
childishly argues that because when a boy at 
Eton he revelled in " the various works of fiction 
which are the joy of youth," and experienced a 
careless rapture in this reading which his con- 
templative and discriminative years now deny 
him, no matter how much finer the art which 
engages his attention, that because of this mel- 
ancholy contrast he wonders if he has not lost 
the capacity for "true aesthetic enjoyment." 
This is philosophic doubt carried to the point 
of perversity, and not likely to be shared by any 
persons of cultivated taste whose judgment has 
not become unbalanced through overmuch intro- 
spection. It really begs the whole question, and 
in about the same way in which it is begged 
by the champions of hedonistic ethics when they 
refuse to recognize the fundamental distinction 
between the pleasures of the sense and the joy 
that the spirit takes in self-sacrifice and high 
impersonal endeavor. 



Frederic Remington, famous for his spirited 
illustrations from Western frontier life, but known 
also as a painter, sculptor, and writer, died at Ridge- 
field, Conn., December 26, at the age of forty-eight. 
He was born in New York State, but had lived much 
in the West, where his varied experiences — as " cow- 
puncher," ranchman, and scout — gave him the in- 
timate knowledge of scenes and characters that were 
so strikingly delineated in his pictures.

THE DIAL 



ABOUT NATIONAL ACADEMIES. 

New York, having erected a Hall of Fame and 
brought it into notice by excluding the one indubi- 
tably famous American poet, has made the country 
a present of a National Academy. The composition 
of this Senate of Immortals, as given in a recent 
number of The Diai, (November 1), is a matter for 
curious study. There is a fair representation of 
New Englanders, and a few other exiles from the 
Great White Way; but the pomp and prodigality 
of New York genius is mainly in evidence. And 
doubtless New York could have done better by itself, 
had it not been too magnanimous not to let the rest 
of the country have a look in. A good third of the 
names would probably be inevitable in any list of 
distinguished living Americans. But the others 
could be matched and overmatched again and again. 

There is of course a good side to this glorification 
of a group. New England in its best days was loyal 
to instincts of locality. It backed and cheered its 
intellectual athletes on, and the spirited runners felt 
the stimulus and sprang forward to win the prizes. 
New York deserves credit for taking care of its own. 
It reminds me of a story which my father used to 
tell, of a visit he paid with a companion to a friend's 
country house. The owner of the property had an 
idiot son ; and my father, introducing his friend, 
said. "This is Mr. Satterthwaite, Sammy. He is a 
Quaker. The Quakers, you know, are good people." 
■ Yes," said the idiot, - good to themselves." It 
used to be said that no Bostonian could escape hav- 
ing a statue erected for him ; and New York seems 
moving in the same laudable direction. But it can 
hardly expect that the rest of the country will bow 
down and worship its totems of a tribe. 

It is hard to conceive just what ideal the makers 
of this Academy had in view, — just what kind of 
sheep they deemed acceptable, and just what kind 
of goats they thought undesirable. It includes men 
of affairs and publicists, but ignores some of our 
greatest. It admits a large number of artists, which 
is a commendable departure from the practice of the 
French Academy. It allows a number of college 
presidents, but disallows others as well and widely 
known. It ignores the Church, the Army and Navy, 
and the Stage. Altogether the list is badly balanced 
and badly selected, and seems to be issued with the 
imprint of a prominent magazine. 

The inevitable questions in all such cases is, 
" What is the Source of Honor ? Whose is the 
authority which confers the stamp of greatness?" 
Artists are envious, and the mob profane. Even 
scientists can hardly be trusted to honor their best 
And a popular vote would be a folly. The French 
Academy was founded at the culminating period of 
the French monarchy. It has gathered traditions 
to itself and become venerable by age. Yet it is 
questionable whether it has not done more harm by 
Its log-rolling, its continual rejection of genius for 
mediocrity, than it has done good by its recognition 
of noble work. Too many great Frenchmen have 



occupied its forty-first chair, for the world to accept 
its judgments as final. Besides, it was instituted for 
a definite purpose — the preservation and promul- 
gation of the French language. It may have kept 
this language pure, but it has kept it thin. The 
piratical English speech, recklessly despoiling the 
tombs of antiquity, ravaging all coasts, bringing 
back booty from the uttermost ends of the earth, has 
trebled and quadrupled its stock of words and idioms, 
and acquired a richness and flexibility which fit it 
for all human uses, and promise to give it the dom- 
ination of the world. If the French Academy has 
failed in its main object — that of keeping the 
French language supreme, — its minor successes in 
cultivating urbanity and precision will not much 
count in the long run. 

We talk a great deal about democracy in America, 
but it looks to me as though we were making a quiet, 
disguised, but determined effort to create an aristoc- 
racy. And quite rightly, in a way. We begin to want 
some tangible evidence of the existence of the best. 
The idea of a society composed of people of achieve- 
ment and renown begins to appeal to us. The move- 
ment is fluid as yet ; it has not hardened into an official 
caste, a plutocracy, or a class of all the talents. Any 
effort toward directing this movement in the way of 
intellectual and spiritual superiority, and away from 
the worship of mere wealth, is good. Coteries and 
associations with intellectual trend are springing up 
all over the country. A bright woman once told me 
that she had just had a dream of heaven, and it was 
exactly like a meeting of the Contemporary Club in 
Philadelphia. Possibly she was an enthusiast, but 
she expressed a feeling of delight in high intercourse 
which I believe is becoming common. 

One use for an American Academy is to furnish 
a beadroll of distinctions. Another purpose it might 
serve, and which I suppose the French Academy 
does serve, would be to bring together persons of 
high and diverse achievements. England, however, 
has managed this business fairly well without an 
Academy. Her people of position and wealth have, 
down at least to a late period, recognized their 
responsibilities toward the intellectual life of the 
land. They have been hungry for celebrities. It 
is impossible to read the English biographies and 
memoirs of the last hundred years and not note how 
rich and full has been the intercourse of great men. 
Almost every Englishman of distinction has seemed 
to know every other of the same class. Here and 
there an isolated artist or man of letters, or a group 
of revolters, has escaped being caught into the full 
current, but as a rule the unofficial Academicians «f 
Great Britain have been invited everywhere. The 
breakfasts of Rogers and Monckton Milnes, the 
dinners of a hundred other hosts, and most of all 
the country house parties of people of rank, have 
been clearing-houses for genius. When the History 
of Civilization in England is written it will become 
evident how much has been due to this hospitality. 
Possibly there have been some drawbacks of pa- 
tronage and caste ; but these have been greatly 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



overweighted by the benefits of acquaintance and 
interchange of thought, amid delightful surroundings, 
which has been made possible for intellectual leaders. 
These benefits have not only been a stimulus but a 
main reward for effort. We have had nothing com- 
parable to this life in America. Here a man of 
genius has been expected to be more grateful for a 
sandwich than an ordinary person would have to be 
for a year of banquets. 

Genius of any kind is not apt to be gregarious. It 
stalks alone, feeds on its own breast like the Pelican 
and reproduces itself like the Phoenix. Only the 
lure of dainty feminine presences brought it into the 
precincts of the HQtel de Rambouillet, the Academia 
Delia Crusca, or the later French salons. And even 
these did not get the big men. Left to itself, genius 
has always preferred the social life of taverns, 
coffee-houses, and small clubs. The Mermaid, the 
Mitre, Will's Coffee House, Dr. Johnson's Club, were 
the Academies of their times. They were the nurs- 
ing places of talent ; in them reputations were made 
or unmade ; there the intellectual life of the day 
flowed freest. 

Yet it may be doubted whether in our times a 
great capital or chief city is a necessary factor in the 
development of the arts and sciences. That it was 
so of old, is unquestionable. Where the king and 
court were, there was the assemblage of intellect. 
But we have changed all that. Weimar, a country 
village, dominated Germany for fifty years ; the 
Lake District and Edinburgh cast the rest of Great 
Britain into the shade for half as long. Victor Hugo 
in the Jersey Islands was a fair counterpoise to Paris. 
Wagner scorned Berlin, and built his throne at 
Beireuth. As long as Tennyson lived, even London 
was in comparison to his hermitage as the low flar- 
ing confused lights of a seaside resort are beside the 
high clear flame of a light-house beacon. Wherever 
the great man is, wherever the few good heads are 
congregated, there is the head of the table. And 
apparently what genius needs is a desert island for 
ten months in the year, and then a passport to the 
best life of the world for the remaining two. 

There has lately been launched, also in New 
York, an organization called The American Civic 
Alliance. Its object is vast, if vague, being nothing 
less than, in the language of its prospectus, "An 
effort to supplement the Government of the people 
with a civic body representing the combined Intel- 
lect and Conscience of the entire nation." Its mem- 
bership is limited to four thousand, and the qualifi- 
cations seem to be quite elastic. Apparently anyone 
of respectable attainments, who has the necessary 
enthusiasm and ten dollars, can belong. This is 
certainly being democratic, and everyone his own 
Academician. Strange as it seems, it looks to me 
as though this rough-and-ready body, if it material- 
izes, might have the germ of greater usefulness in it 
than the localized Academy I have been discussing. 
If its State chapters could bring together the best 
minds of their various sections, if a wave of enthu- 
siasm could be sent through the whole body, some- 



thing might come of it. It would at least make for 
the acquaintance of people who in various lines of 
work are trying to do their best. It might do for 
us, in a measure, what the flow and interchange of 
English social life have done for Englishmen. It 
might teach the politicians that literary men are not 
necessarily fools, and the clergy that politicians are 
not inevitably " crooks." From such a general un- 
derstanding among our leaders in all departments, a 
larger and fuller life might dawn for our country.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The year's additions to the Library of Con- 
gress, according to the recently published report of 
the librarian, amount to 167,677 volumes, besides 
pamphlet, manuscript, and other material, bringing 
the total book collection up to 1,702,635 volumes. 
Among the noteworthy accessions is a set of the 
great Chinese Encyclopaedia, of which we have 
before made mention in connection with the copy 
owned by the British Museum and regarded as one 
of its most valuable possessions. The Washington 
set was presented by the Chinese government — 
possibly as a slight acknowledgment of American 
courtesy and fair play in returning the undistributed 
balance of the Boxer indemnity. Among the valu- 
able manuscripts lately transferred to our national 
library from various departments of the government 
are all the applications for public office received 
during Washington's administration, the original 
accounts and vouchers of his expenses in the Revo- 
lutionary War, and documents concerning pension 
claims of soldiers in that war. The catalogue cards 
now so satisfactorily prepared by the library and 
furnished to more than a thousand other libraries, 
both at home and abroad, have attained a yearly 
circulation of about four million cards. A method 
of exchange is in operation whereby a collective or 
union public library catalogue is being formed, to 
indicate the contents of all the great libraries of the 
country. Good work, too, is being done in the draw- 
ing up of library rules and regulations, the Wash- 
ington code being already adopted by the Library 
Association of England ; the desirability of its still 
further use on the Continent will be discussed next 
June at the international library congress to be held 
at Brussels. 

A LIBRARY OF BANKING AND CURRENCY, of twenty 

volumes or more, is to be published during the com- 
ing year under the auspices of the National Mone- 
tary Commission, and efforts will be made to give 
the volumes a large circulation throughout the coun- 
try. The government will be the publisher, and it 
is hoped that the books can be distributed by the 
superintendent of documents at a moderate price. 
Private purchasers may be few enough, but public 
and semi-public libraries will be interested in secur- 
ing sets of these authoritative works, which will,

THE DIAL 



collectively, give a full history and description of 
the monetary and banking systems of the world. 
Representatives of the Commission have for some 
time been collecting material and holding interviews 
with finance ministers and leading bankers in various 
countries. The services of the foremost authorities 
in the many departments into which the general 
subject divides itself have been secured. In the 
matter of Japanese banking, for example, a theme 
of especial interest in view of Japan's rapid financial 
development in the last forty years, papers have 
been expressly prepared by Marquis Katsura, Pre- 
mier and Minister of Finance, by Baron Sakatani, 
ex-Minister of Finance, and by Baron Takahashi, 
vice-governor of the Bank of Japan. There is at 
present unusual interest here in the question of 
banking, and the Commission expresses the hope that 
business men and students of finance will study the 
volumes and cooperate in devising for this country 
a more adequate banking system. 

A QUEER SCHEME OF LITERARY CENSORSHIP has 

been agitating the book world of England. The 
circulating libraries wish to decide on the morality 
or immorality of a book before it shall be formally 
turned over to the book-buying and book-reading 
public. If approved by the circulating libraries, 
through some examining board appointed by them, 
the book would enjoy the patronage of those com- 
mercially important institutions. If disapproved on 
the score of immorality, what an advertisement the 
book would thereby receive ! The plan is too obvi- 
ously objectionable, not to say absurd, on many 
accounts, to be taken seriously — more ridiculous 
even than the much-criticised puritanic committee of 
fiction-sifters voluntarily undertaking to decide what 
novels are good enough for the Boston Public Lib- 
rary. It is no wonder that the English Society of 
Authors is strongly opposed to the scheme, and that 
a leading London journal pronounces it " incom- 
parably more deadly " than the theatrical censorship 
which has stirred up so much opposition in England. 
The interesting situation is discussed more fully by 
The Dial's London correspondent in this issue. 

The perils of precocity in a popular writer are 
grave. Having early made his mark and familiar- 
ized the public with his juvenile genius, can he per- 
suade his readers to accept riper and worthier and 
it may be heavier work at his hands ? Will Mr. 
Chesterton, for example, find himself forced to con- 
tinue writing Chestertonese for the next thirty or 
forty years, or will he be able to drop the journal- 
istic cock-sureness and epigrammatic smartness that 
have so well served him thus far? He is only 
thirty-five, and the prospect of forty years more of 
Chestertonic paradox somehow daunts one. Mr. 
Kipling, a somewhat older writer, is one whose later 
work, whatever its excellence, seems to suffer by 
comparison with those first fine flights of his imag- 
ination before the cares of his country weighed on 



his mind and prompted him to produce rhymed 
homilies on imperialism. Another early successful 
author is Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, from 
whose pen we are not getting many new books of 
late. Is it possible that he has described his own 
fate in " The Altar Fire," and that his pen, once so 
fertile, has written itself out ? And yet Mr. Benson 
is still several years under fifty. It is to be hoped 
that he is simply resting and ripening for yet worthier 
achievements in literature. To be handicapped by 
youthful fame is worse than to be muffled in a not 
easily penetrable obscurity. 

The singular usage of some Latin plurals 
invites passing comment. A current paragraph, in 
a newspaper standing at or near the head of the 
list for acknowledged literary excellence, runs as 
follows : " ' Cook's data turned over,' says a head- 
line, referring to the delivery of the stuff to the 
Copenhagen scientists. The next thing will be to 
turn it inside out. Was there ever any ' data ' that 
was so mercilessly criticised as this will be? The 
examination of Peary's records was like an afternoon 
tea in comparison." No fewer than four times does 
the writer of this short paragragh proclaim the rusti- 
ness of his Latin. We have long been accustomed, 
though not wholly reconciled, to the misuse of 
" stamina " as a singular noun. " His stamina was 
inadequate to the strain put upon it " might now be 
read in one's morning journal without robbing the 
entire day of its enjoyment ; but " the data was " 
still jars one rather painfully. Other like instances 
will occur to many readers. Thus do the last linger- 
ing traces of a polite education go the way of Hans 
Breitmann's " Barty," — into the Evoigkeit. 

• • • 

An octogenarian jaunt might appropriately be 
the title of a volume describing the European trip 
just undertaken by Mr. John T. Trowbridge. He 
and Mrs. Trowbridge have recently sailed from 
Boston for a winter's sojourn in sunny Italy — so 
pleasantly at contrast with east-windy Boston, or 
breezy Arlington either, the venerable author's long- 
time place of residence. Let us hope he will feel 
moved to add a sequel, embracing this Italian visit, 
to his already published u My Own Story," which 
appeared six years ago. Mr. Trowbridge, at eighty- 
two, braving the winter Atlantic for a scamper 
across Europe — if he will pardon the levity of the 
expression — is surpassed only by Mr. John Bigelow, 
who, with the burden of ten more years to carry, 
recently ran over to Paris, and then, with equal 
lightness of step, returned to present us with the three 
noteworthy volumes of his " Retrospections." 

This year's winner of the Nobel prize for 
literature. Miss Selma Lagerlef, will be generally 
acknowledged to have deserved the honor. Indeed, 
it would have come to her before now had not the 
committee of award feared the charge of prejudice 
in thus choosing a writer of their own nationality

[Jan. 1, 



for a distinction of world-wide significance. Miss 
LagerlQf, now entering on her second half-century, 
has written tales of Swedish life that have won for 
her a position not unlike that occupied by Walter 
Scott among his compatriots. She has revealed 
what was before but dimly perceived, the poetic 
meaning and romantic charm of Swedish legend 
and Swedish life. Best known to us of her books 
are " Gdsta Berling's Saga " and " The Wonderful 
Adventures of Nils," — and concerning the latter 
there is a touching and a true story that will bear 
re-telling. Not long after the book appeared, its 
author received from an orphan boy bearing the 
same name as its hero a letter telling her of the 
forlorn life he was living in his dreary little world, 
and so moving in its tone that she hunted him up 
and took him to her home and heart, adopting him 
as her son. From all that can be learned there 
seems no question but Miss Lagerlof is a woman of 
genius and also of warm and noble sympathies. 

The story of a growing appetite for books 
among the people of San Francisco (rising in renewed 
vigor from the prostrating calamity of a few years 
ago) is told in Librarian Watson's latest annual report 
of the public library of that city. With not more 
than seventy-six thousand volumes at its disposal, 
the library circulates each volume more than eight 
times yearly on an average, while one branch reports 
an annual circulation of thirteen times for each vol- 
ume, and another fourteen times. The past year 
has shown the largest addition to the supply of books 
in the history of the library, and its present tempor- 
ary quarters are apparently becoming inadequate at 
a geometrically progressive rate. All of which 
speaks well for the city's devotion to the things of 
intellect. An issue of library bonds to the extent 
of $1,647,000 was authorized six years ago, and a 
part of the issue has been made, the proceeds of 
which have been used in the purchase of land for a 
new library building that is to cost a million dollars. 

The performance of two plays of Euripides, 
within a few days of each other, in two Massachu- 
setts cities, Boston and Springfield, speaks well for 
the still undegraded theatrical taste of at least a part 
of the better-educated public. The Bryn Mawr Club, 
of Boston, presented on December 10 the "Medea" 
in Professor Gilbert Murray's English verse trans- 
lation, and three days later a company of Greek 
students of the American International College at 
Springfield played the " Alcestis " in the original 
Greek. While not attaining to the magnificence 
and impressiveness of last year's rendering of the 
"Agamemnon" in the Harvard Stadium — a gran- 
deur less consonant with the more modern-spirited 
Euripides than with the tragic sublimities of the 
earlier poet — these two attempts to revive the 
classic drama of Athens were highly creditable to all 
concerned, and were well received by appreciative 
audiences. 



FROM LITERARY LONDON. 



(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
The two things that are most interesting the En- 
glish public since I last wrote are, first, the attempt 
to purify our literature through a censorship emanat- 
ing from what are called subscription libraries ; and, 
second, the question of an Academy of Literature. 

The first question has arisen in part, no doubt, 
from genuine remonstrances having been made to 
these libraries in behalf of parents who think that 
their children are taking out books that are very 
bad for them. The whole problem is a difficult 
one. On the one hand, one does not see that any 
censorship, especially one coming from the cir- 
culating libraries, which in this country are very 
keen commercial affairs, on a basis of private 
ownership, would be other than detrimental to good 
literature. 

Four of our great circulating libraries, having an 
enormous business — not only in this country but in 
some cases all over the world, — although rivals in 
everything else, have joined themselves together into 
a sympathetic union over this question. First, there 
is Mudie's, a splendidly managed library, founded 
by the late Mr. Charles Edward Mudie, and now a 
flourishing company. In one department of this 
great business you may see huge boxes packed with 
books to go to India and the British Colonies. These 
boxes are sent to and fro as systematically as if it 
were only across the road. Naturally, considerable 
control is exercised by the library as to the books 
distributed in this way. The next firm is W. H. 
Smith & Sons. This company once had at its head 
Mr. W. H. Smith, who held important posts in sev- 
eral Conservative Governments. The third of these 
firms is known as Boot's Book-Lovers Library. Mr. 
Boot was made a knight the other day, and is now 
Sir Jesse Boot. He has chemist shops all over 
London, and the happy idea came to him of adding 
book-lending to medicine-vending; and there is no 
doubt that the plan has proved a great success. The 
fourth of these book firms is known as The Times 
Book Club, a concern already known to American 
readers through the big fight that raged between 
" The Times " newspaper and the book publishers 
when this club was founded, the dispute being over 
the right of the club to sell the new books that it 
had purchased at second-hand prices without a certain 
interval intervening, — a plan obviously disastrous 
to the booksellers. 

These four firms have made the proposal to the 
book publishers that time should be given to the libra- 
rians to examine books before they are taken by the 
libraries, with the view of discovering if they contain 
anything either " scandalous," " libellous," or " im- 
moral." The Publishers' Association of London 
promptly fell into line with this idea ; which shows . 
that certain publishers are evidently not connected 
with that Association — presumably the publishers of 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



the books aimed at. The Publishers' Association, 
however, desired to consult the Society of Authors, 
an organization which undoubtedly has the majority 
of English authors among its members. The Society 
of Authors, at their meeting held to discuss the 
matter, declared that the libraries obviously had the 
power already to select what books they willed for 
their customers. The Society declined, however, to 
accept the condition that the books of their authors 
should be submitted to any committee of librarians, 
and indeed described the claim of the libraries as 
unwarrantable. 

Mr. Edmund Gosse wrote a very sensible letter 
to " The Times " in which he condemned this 
attempt at censorship on the part of what would be a 
secret or irresponsible committee. He incidentally 
declared that in their day Darwin's books would 
have been impossible under such conditions. Where- 
upon Mr. John Murray wrote to u The Times " to 
say that, as the publisher of Darwin's books, he did 
not think that such works as the " Origin of Species" 
would have been in any danger. Mr. Murray has 
a short memory. I recall the days when, in this 
country at least, Darwin's books were looked upon 
by more than half the community as emanating 
direct from hell. I recall that Mr. Mudie, the 
founder of the Library bearing his name, was a very 
strong dissenter, who would gladly have burnt Darwin 
and all his works. But Mr. Mudie was also a 
shrewd business man. and could not have acted with- 
out the cooperation of his competitors. 

My own strong feeling regarding the proposed 
censorship is that the remedy is to be found in the 
newspapers and not in the libraries. The call for 
novels is largely based upon reviews, and if a paper 
denounces any given book as immoral it is sure to 
have a great sale. It is not the favorable reviews, 
but the unfavorable, that sell a book, at least in this 
country. The condemnation of the libraries would 
serve as an additional advertisement of a bad book. 
However, we shall await the result of the struggle 
with no small interest. That some horrid books are 
now being issued here, is undeniable. 

We have also had considerable discussion of the 
question of a National Academy of Literature. For 
ages past, English men of letters have hankered 
after such an institution as they have in France. 
Matthew Arnold made great fun of the idea in a 
very clever essay, and it seemed to have quite ceased 
to be considered. Meanwhile, however, some clever 
men in the realms of non-imaginative literature have 
formed an Academy among themselves, which con- 
tains some of our ablest writers, — the British 
Ambassador to America, for example. It is devoted 
purely to the work of the student, and not to that of 
the writer who writes because he must, — that is to 
say. the imaginative artist. The Society calling itself 
the British Academy has a very energetic secretary 
in Mr. Israel Gollancz, and has been taking the lead 
in directions in which I for one cannot see that it 
has any clear authority. It organized, for exam- 



ple, the Milton Celebration in London ; it organized 
the Tennyson Centenary, and it took in hand the 
whole arrangements of a funeral service to George 
Meredith in Westminster Abbey. These activities 
have awakened a spirit of revolt among our men of 
letters, — that is to say, among imaginative writers. 
They assert that a Society which does not admit any 
of their number into its ranks has no right to assume 
functions of this character. Tennyson could not 
have been a member of it; Meredith was not a 
member. Yet the Society arrogated to itself the 
task of commemorating these very men. The 
Society might perhaps justify itself by saying that it 
only does what there is no one else to do. But the 
Society of Authors clearly thinks that such things 
are the especial business of that body. There is no 
doubt that the Society does number among its sub- 
scribers a majority of our English writers. Yet one 
feels that its membership is made up almost too 
indiscriminately. Perhaps the ideal Academy would 
be made by a selection of forty of the most brilliant 
imaginative writers of the day. But who is to make 
the selection ? The popular verdict could hardly be 
trusted. Mr. Hall Caine, for example, might be 
elected a member of such an Academy, because he 
has thousands of readers, although his books are 
quite remote from literature. Mr. Maurice Hewlett 
demands that the Society of Authors should con- 
sider the question ; but I doubt very much if that 
would be the best method. It is rather the a critics " 
of authors than the authors themselves who should 
have the power of selection ; and to that the authors 
would never submit. Altogether, I do not imagine 
that a National Academy of Literature is likely 
to be established in London for many a year to 
come. 

In a recent letter I referred to the Johnson Club 
in London. I have just come away from a dinner 
which took place on the anniversary of Dr. Johnson's 
death, and on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Club's existence. The Club numbers only about 
thirty members, but its membership has been a very 
interesting one. Mr. Augustine Birrell, for exam- 
ple, has been an enthusiastic supporter from the 
beginning, although his duties as a Minister of the 
; Crown have kept him away of late. Sir Henry M. 
Stanley, the well-known African explorer, was a 
member ; Dr. Birkbeck Hill, who edited the best 
edition of Boswell's Johnson that has ever been pub- 
lished, was a very regular attendant. Mr. Austin 
Dobson was a member for some years, until, in fact, 
; he ceased to go out at night. Each member takes 
! his turn in being what is called the " Prior " of the 
Club. A quite recent Prior was Mr. H. B. Wheatley, 
who has written some important books on London, 
and is the editor, preeminently, of Pepys's Diary. 
The Prior for this year is Mr. Thomas Seccombe,

and one of the ablest of the reviewing staff of the

Beeching, and Professor Walter Raleigh. Anthony 
Hope we all know as a popular novelist ; he is also 
an excellent after-dinner speaker. Canon Beeching, 
who is a canon of Westminster Abbey, is one of the 
few men of to-day who are keeping alive the literary 
traditions of that church which were so pronounced 
when we had Dean Stanley and Dean Church, to say 
nothing of Dr. Merivale and Bishop Creighton. It 
might almost be said that Canon Ainger was the 
last of the literary clergymen of England ; for Canon 
Beeching, with considerable critical gifts, is but little 
known to the reading public. The third of our guests, 
Professor Walter Raleigh, is the son of an eminent 
Nonconformist Minister, Dr. Alexander Raleigh; 
he now holds the chair of English Literature at 
Oxford, and has written books on Milton and 
Wordsworth that have attracted much attention. 
But perhaps I have said too much about the John- 
son Club and its pleasant gatherings. We meet 
only three times a year ; a paper is read and dis- 
cussed, and we drink in silence to the memory of 
" the Master." 

The event of the week in which I am writing is 
the publication of the "Jubilee Number" of the 
" Cornhill Magazine." The " Cornhill " has existed 
for fifty years. Thackeray was its first editor; its 
other editors have included Sir Leslie Stephen, Mr. 
Frederick Greenwood, and Mr. James Payn. I rather 
fancy that Mr. Greenwood had some difference of 
opinion with the publishers of the magazine, Messrs. 
Smith & Elder, and hence his name is strangely 
ignored in the volley of congratulations contained 
in this "Jubilee Number." Mr. Stanley Weyman 
writes about James Payn ; Mr. W. E. Norris writes 
about Sir Leslie Stephen ; while Lady Ritchie, the 
daughter of Thackeray, writes about her father. 
There is a poem by Thomas Hardy that has distinct 
charm. Altogether, the " Cornhill " jubilee is a very 
notable celebration, because magazines that love to 
publish literature are becoming more and more 
uncommon in England. There is a very marked 
deterioration in this field. Mr. John Murray once 
had a nice magazine, with good literary matter in 
it, called "Murray's Magazine." Our other old- 
time firm, the Longmans, had a magazine called 
" Longman's Magazine," which also published much 
good literatui'e. The Macmillans issued a magazine 
which they called after their name, that had equal 
merits. All three are dead. " Blackwood's " and 
" Cornhill " alone survive of all the magazines run 
by high-class publishers aiming to provide good 
readable material of the best quality ; and I do not 
believe that either of these has a very large sale. 
Thackeray boasted of a hundred thousand copies of 
the earlier numbers of " Cornhill." I am afraid 
your readers would be astonished if they heard the 
present-day sales. The fact undoubtedly is that 
literary taste in this country seems to have dete-

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND SPELLING 

REFORM. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The pith of Professor Paul Shorey's courteous 
letter in The Dial of December 1 is to be found 
in his assertion that the amelioration of our spelling 
cannot be confided solely to profest scholars, learned 
in the history of English, because it " involves many 
nice questions of taste, literary feeling, psychology 
of education, and practical consequences, in the de- 
cision of which the judgments of all thoughtful men, 
whatever their specialties, are entitled to considera- 
tion." And with this assertion no friend of a more 
logical orthography has any desire to quarrel. 

By an interesting coincidence, the same number 
of The Dial contained an account of the organiza- 
tion of an American Academy of Arts and Letters, 
having now forty-five living members. In this 
article the declaration is made that " the collective 
distinction of the list is deeply impressive," and that 
it is " clearly representative of what is best in our 
intellectual and artistic life." Probably the writer 
of that article would be ready to admit that men 
who have been elected to the American Academy 
of Arts and Letters ought to be specially qualified 
to deal with what Professor Shorey has aptly de- 
scribed as " nice questions of taste " and of " literary 
feeling." 

It may, therefore, be interesting to have it pointed 
out that six members of the Simplified Spelling 
Board are also members of the American Academy — 
Messrs. Clemens, Higginson, Lounsbury, Matthews, 
Roosevelt, and White. Three other members of the 
Academy are on record as sympathizing heartily 
with the effort to better our orthography, — Messrs. 
Burroughs, Cable, and Ho wells. This has an obvious 
significance upon which there is no need to expand. 

But what is almost as significant is the fact that 
at most only one of the twenty other men of letters 
in this carefully selected group of leaders in the 
several arts, — only Mr. Lodge, — has publicly ex- 
prest his opposition to the progressive simplifying 
of our spelling. Of course, it may be quite possible 
that there are others among this silent score of Amer- 
ican authors who do not approve of the movement. 
But if any such there are, they have seen fit to keep 
their opinions to themselves, for whatever reason. 
On the other hand, those members of the American 
Academy who believe that something ought to be 
done now to make our noble tongue fitter for service 
thruout the world have not hesitated to stand forward 
to testify to the faith that is in them. 

Professor Shorey does not say in so many words 
that scholarship in English is a disqualification for 
advocacy of spelling reform ; but he seems to be on the 
verge of insinuating this. That Professor Lounsbury 
is tainted by this disqualification, cannot be denied ; 
but it does not attach to Messrs. Burroughs, Cable,

of the American Academy to deal with " nice ques-

[It was, of course, the " collective distinction 
of the list " of " sixty- two names altogether," 
constituting the total membership of the Acad- 
emy, that we found to be impressive, — not the 
half-dozen members who are members also of 
the Simplified Spelling Board. And we espec- 
ially emphasized Matthew Arnold's admirable 
statement of what a real Academy must be, — 
M an institution which will discourage every 
orthographical antic, every manifestation of the 
provincial spirit." — Edr. The Dial.] 



A LOCALIZED AMERICAN ACADEMY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

It is easy to see that an American Academy of 
Arts and Letters, as outlined in your issue of Novem- 
ber 1, may be a useful and authoritative institution, 
and a vital force in the upbuilding of our higher 
national life. But tbere are phases of it that call 
for thoughtful consideration. It is hard to see how 
an institution representing one locality, however 
meritorious it may be, can properly be regarded as 
a national Academy. It is true that for such an 
institution the best men should be chosen, wherever 
found ; and it may be that the promoters of the 
Academy have had this principle in mind. If so, 
their minds afford subject for interesting inquiry. 
Culture, the pursuit of arts and letters, are commonly 
believed to tend toward a broadening of view, a 
correcting of what is narrow and provincial ; yet the 
proverbial inability of New York to see beyond the 
Hudson River, its naive unconsciousness of the rest 
of the country, have seldom been more signally 
displayed. 

An inspection of the list of names of the new 
Academicians, as given in The Dial article already 
referred to, shows that of the sixty-two members 
about forty (two-thirds of the total membership) are 
of New York ; while of the remaining third, Boston 
and vicinity have fourteen. Of the eight remain- 
ing, Baltimore has two, Philadelphia two, Wash- 
ington two, and far-off Georgia has one for her 
beloved " Uncle Remus." One membership is thus 
left for all that is " American " beyond the Eastern 
seaboard ; and this (under the circumstances) rather 
overwhelming honor goes to Mr. John Muir of 
California, a man far greater than any distinction 
like this could make him, but distinguished in science 
and exploration rather than in arts and letters. 

Now my present purpose is not to complain of 
all this — not to show the suitability of any of the 



scholars or artists or men of letters in the vast and 
influential region thus excluded from the ken of 
culture in the East, or to urge the representation of 
any of the great universities of the West or the 
Pacific Slope, — but only to call attention to the 
facts of the case, leaving others to ponder their sig- 
nificance and to consider whether an " American " 
Academy can be established on a basis such as is 

here disclosed. _ _ __

THE ORIGIN OF " OLD GRIMES." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
It is so seldom one finds The Dial napping that 
I am tempted to express my surprise at the note on 
" Old Grimes " in the last issue. The statements 
that the origin of the song " is now revealed in Mr. 
Dwight C. Kilbourn's ' History of the Bench and 
Bar of Litchfield County, Connecticut,'" and "The 
authorship of the song is now traced to a source 
sufficiently distinguished," are made as if they an- 
nounced a new discovery. As a matter of fact, the 
authorship of the poem has always, I think, been 
generally known. Both Duyckinck's " Cyclopedia 
of American Literature " and Griswold's " Poets 
and Poetry of America " discuss the work of the 
Honorable Albert G. Greene (not Green, as The 
Dial gives it), and print among their samples of his 
poetry " Old Grimes," and that other favorite of the 
earlier school-readers, " The Baron's last Banquet." 
" O'er a low couch the setting sun had thrown its latest ray, 

Where in his last strong agony a dying warrior lay, 

The stern old Baron Rudiger. ..." 

Several of the more recent handbooks of American 
literature also perpetuate the memory of '' Old 
Grimes" and its author. 

In " Book Notes " for May 30, 1908, Mr. Sidney 
S. Rider, of Providence, gives two versions of the 
poem, and reprints an interesting letter from Greene, 
who says : " It was first published, I think, in 1823, 
in one of the Providence papers, for which purpose 
a copy had been requested of me by the editor. In 
reply to your question respecting the authorship of 
the stanzas, I answer that the first verse, for aught 
I know to the contrary, may have been repeated 
and sung from time immemorial. Whether it 
formed part of some earlier production now for- 
gotten, or was one of those fragments of verse of 
which no one can tell the origin or author, I know 
not. That verse was used as a file-leader for the 
remainder. ... I need only add that, with the 
exception of the first, every line of them was written 
by myself." Mr. Rider found what he believed to 
be the first publication of the poem in the "Provi- 
dence Gazette " for January 16, 1822. As Greene 
was not born until 1802, the date given in The 
Dial (1812) is surely incorrect.

Some Evolution House-cleaning.* 

The purpose of all scientific investigation is 
to learn as much as possible about natural 
phenomena, in order that man may order his life 
to the best advantage with reference to these 
phenomena. In carrying out this purpose, 
science sets before itself the ideal of dealing 
only with verifiable truth. But in the develop- 
ment of the actual intellectual machinery of 
investigation (hypotheses, theories, and the like) 
it results not infrequently that this ideal gets 
put to one side and for the time being forgotten. 
Under such circumstances, a great deal of so- 
called scientific endeavor and speculation comes 
to deal with " things as they might be " rather 
than with " things as they are." Nowhere has 
this been more truly the case than in the study 
of Organic Evolution. 

Darwin and Wallace showed at the outstart 
how the selection idea might account for many 
of the observed phenomena of organic nature, 
and brought forward definite and cogent evi- 
dence that selection had really acted to produce 
certain of these results. This idea of selection 
developed quickly into certain set formulae, and 
much — indeed, most — of the speculation and 
writing on Evolution up to the present time has 
concerned itself with the discussion of the prob- 
able results of the application of these formulae 
to organisms and conditions as they might con- 
ceivably be. Thus, the brilliant coloring of 
certain butterflies has been" explained " as warn- 
ing coloration, developed by the action of natural 
selection, to show the birds that prey on butter- 
flies that these particular kinds were not whole- 
some or palatable, and had therefore better be 
left strictly alone. Volumes have been written 
on this subject, and detailed phases of it have 
called forth as heated discussion as ever did the 
famous Theory of Tittlebats. Yet practically 
no one ever took the trouble, or even thought 
it worth while, to see whether, as a matter of 
fact, birds do really prey on butterflies to any 
extent, and whether the effect of the brilliant 
coloration actually is as it is theoretically sup- 
posed to be. 

A periodical house-cleaning is just as neces- 
sary and just as disagreeable intellectually as it 
is physically or morally. Mr. Dewar and Mr. 
Finn have taken it upo n themselves to clean up

the Evolution house ; to throw away the rubbish, 
and carefully dust and place conspicuously upon 
the mantel those scientific ideals that have been 
rather hidden by the large and ill-assorted collec- 
tion of mental bric-a-brac which the workers in 
the house have allowed or helped to accumulate. 
On the whole, these gentlemen make very effi- 
cient " help "; they have done their work unusu- 
ally well. 

" The Making of Species " frankly has as its 
aim the destructive criticism of Neo-Darwinism, 
— or, as the authors rather curiously prefer to 
designate this school of thought, " Wallaceism." 
In particular, the attempt is made to show that 
the Allmacht of Natural Selection, which is the 
keynote of the Neo-Darwinism position, is in 
very large degree fanciful rather than real ; that 
it depends on metaphysical speculation rather 
than on the actual observation of living plants 
and animals under natural conditions. The 
method of the book is to bring forward an array 
of concrete facts observed by the authors them- 
selves in their ornithological studies, or cited 
from the literature, and then to show that these 
facts cannot be accounted for by certain exist- 
ing theories of the method of evolution without 
straining logic and credulity to an absurd de- 
gree. The authors' standpoint and way of pro- 
ceeding are refreshingly Darwinian. 

" Like Darwin, we welcome all factors which appear 
to be capable of affecting Evolution. We have no axe 
to grind in the shape of a pet hypothesis, and conse- 
quently our passions are not aroused when men come 
forward with new ideas seemingly opposed to some 
which already occupy the field. We recognize the 
extreme complexity of the problems that confront us. 
We look facts in the face and decline to ignore any, no 
matter how ill they fit in with existing theories. We 
recognize the strength and the weakness of the Dar- 
winian theory." 

The first two chapters are introductory and 
historical, dealing with the rise and development 
of the theory of Natural Selection and with some 
of the more important criticisms that have been 
directed against it during the last fifty years. 
The next three chapters, on " Variation," 
" Hybridism," and " Inheritance," contain keen 
critical discussions of a number of problems and 
lines of work in the foreground of interest and 
attention to-day. DeVries's mutation theory, as 
a general theory of evolution, is criticised, al- 
though the great value of his experimental inves- 
tigations is fully recognized. The discussions 
of hybridism and inheritance are excellent. A 
wealth of material regarding hybrids amongst 
wild forms is presented ; nothing could show 
more convincingly how greatly the importance 
and generality of the Mendelian principles of 



1910.] 



THE DTAL 



13 



heredity is exaggerated by some of the more 
active and zealous investigators in that field. 

The next two chapters deal with two of the 
pet theories dearest to the heart of the orthodox 
Neo- Darwinian ; namely, protective and warning 
coloration and mimicry on the one hand, and 
sexual selection on the other hand. The criti- 
cisms are sharp and convincing. There can be 
no doubt that much of the post-Darwinian re- 
finement and extension of theory and speculation 
on these subjects is utter nonsense, having no 
relation whatever to the real facts of Nature. 

The last chapter gives a very clear and excel- 
lent exposition of the factors (and their relative 
importance and limitations) now known to in- 
fluence evolution. The authors point out, with 
entire correctness and justice, that " The real 
problem is the cause of variations ; or, in other 
words, how species originate. At present our 
knowledge of the causes of variation and muta- 
tion is practically nil. . . . The future of biology 
is largely in the hands of the practical breeder." 

The worst that can be said of this extremely 
interesting and stimulating book is that the 
authors weaken the presentation of their case by 
the adoption of an unfortunate style of expres- 
sion. The book was written in a very short 
time, considering the range and importance of 
the topics treated, and its tone throughout is 
rather flippant. It is certain that a more tactful 
presentation of the criticisms and evidence would 
have gained for the book much more respectful 
and immediate consideration by professional 
biologists. In its earnestness, the diction occa- 
sionally gets amusingly turgid. Thus, the fol- 
lowing sentence, in its mixture of desperate 
earnestness and foozled grammar, reminds one 
of nothing so much as of the small boy who 
chokes and swallows as he tries to state an im- 
portant matter with all the force that he can 
command : " We are endeavoring to save biology 
in England from committing suicide, to save it 
from the hands of those into which it has fallen."

A Survey of American Literature.*

collaboration with members of the Faculty of 
Cornell University, is a compendium of material

development. For more reasons than one, the 
volume awakens interest. It is M No. 4000 " of 
the Tauchnitz Editions, a " memorial volume " 
in the well-known Collection of British Authors 
which, instituted by Baron Tauchnitz in 1841, 
has now reached the proportions indicated by 
the number of this issue. Its significance as a 
" memorial volume," in thus marking a notable 
turning-point in the enlargement of the series, is 
emphasized by the fact that " No. 2000 " took 
the form of a volume by Henry Morley upon 
" English Literature in the Reign of Victoria." 
No account of literature in America has hitherto 
appeared in the Collection. The Manual is 
dedicated " to President Theodore Roosevelt." 
The distinctive feature of the work is the plan 
of arrangement, which presents the nineteenth- 
century literature in six divisions under the 
headings, The Historians, The Novelists, The 
Poets, The Essayists and the Humorists, The 
Orators and the Divines, and The Scientists ; a 
seventh section is given to the Periodicals. 
There are obvious advantages in such a plan, 
and obvious disadvantages. It is adhered to 
rigidly, not only in cases like those of Emerson 
and Lowell, who are consequently " split " into 
essayists and poets, but also with Irving, Poe, 
and Holmes, who, like a certain noted actress 
on a well-remembered occasion, are here com- 
pelled to appear in three parts. The awkward- 
ness of such an appearance is perhaps less note- 
worthy than the danger of disproportionate and 
inconsistent treatment. Take Lowell, for ex- 
ample : the scant single page which barely gives 
the titles of his prose essays is painfully inade- 
quate, and altogether out of proportion when 
compared with the seven and a half pages given 
to Lowell in the chapter on the Poets, even 
when we note that all biographical data is pre- 
sented in this latter section. In Irving's case 
there is considerable repetition in two of the three 
divisions ; in fact the " Knickerbocker History " 
is successively described as history, fiction, and 
humorous essay, — which may be altogether 
proper : but there is something like contradiction 
in the description of the " Life of Washington " 
as "monumental" by one writer, and as "the 
task- work of his declining years " by another. 
However, this is said not so much by way of 
criticism as in illustrating the difficulties that 
attend this method of presentation. As a mat- 
ter of fact, we think that the authors have kept 
well together ; they have met the difficulties with 
a degree of success impossible had they not been 
in constant and close touch with one another. 
The work is distinctively a product of Cornell

scholarship. Mr. Stanton is a graduate of that 
university, and his associates are members of its 
faculty. This kindred in authorship includes 
yet more ; for the two sections dealing with 
Colonial Literature and The Revolutionary 
Period are an abridgment of the masterly work 
of the late Moses Coit Tyler, formerly a pro- 
fessor at Cornell. It was not only gracefully 
appropriate thus to join the distinguished name 
of another Cornellian with the group, but em- 
inently wise and just ; for certainly no summary 
of those periods in our literary history can ever 
stand except on the foundation of Tyler's work. 

The largest section in the Manual is that upon 
the Novelists, by Professor Clark S. Northup. 
It is also the most interesting. More than a 
quarter of the volume is here included, and the 
list, which begins with Charles Brockden Brown, 
comprises a hundred and eighty names ; yet 
Professor Northup is discriminating and concise 
in his commentary. In view of the great and 
rapid growth of fiction in this generation, it is 
surprising to note that one of the earliest of 
American novels, the crude and sentimental 
" Charlotte Temple" (1790), has survived its 
century of life through more than a hundred 
editions, its last appearance having been in 1905. 
In his account of the beginnings, Mr. Northup 
does not include Sarah Morton's " Power of 
Sympathy" (1789), which sometimes figures 
as the first American novel, although sup- 
pressed previous to publication. The much- 
discussed authorship of two conspicuously suc- 
cessful American novels is definitely settled in 
these pages. It is announced authoritatively 
that Professor Henry Adams, the historian, is 
the author of " Democracy " (1880), and that 
John Hay wrote "The Bread- Winners " (1883). 

In the remaining divisions of the book we have 
the Historians, presented by Dr. Isaac Madison 
Bentley ; the Essayists and the Humorists, by 
Professor Elmer James Bailey. The section on 
the Poets, and that on the Orators and the 
Divines, are by Professor Lane Cooper. Pro- 
fessor Northup provides the section on the 
Scientists, and that on the Periodicals. The 
latter is, necessarily, much condensed, and will 
doubtless seem meagre to American readers. It 
must give The Dial a feeling of loneliness to 
find that it is about the only Western periodical 
of which Professor Northup is aware. Had he 
consulted Mr. Herbert Fleming's very complete 
monograph on this subject (published by the 
University of Chicago), this section would prob- 
ably have been considerably expanded.

Greek Culture axd Modern Life.* 



If experience qualifies one to give counsel, the 
cause of Greek studies would look far to find 
two better fitted advocates than the authors of 
the two volumes before us. Each has devoted 
to that cause more than half a century of un- 
broken activity, and each has been peculiarly 
successful in brhiging his own life into vital 
contact with the deepest currents of Greek life 
which have come down to us through the souls 
of men, as well as with the more external 
remainders of Greek civilization. 

The three chapters of Professor Gildersleeve's 
little volume entitled " Hellas and Hesperia " 
were delivered as lectures before the University 
of Virginia, on the Barbour-Page foundation. 
An old man thus returning to the home of his 
scholastic youth must naturally be less formal 
than under other circumstances; and this fact 
gives to his words a personal touch which can 
only enhance their value to those who have been 
fortunate enough to know him, though it may 
result in some disappointment to persons who 
open the volume in search of so thorough and 
logical a defence of Greek studies as a man of 
the author's attainments might present. As to 
a formal plea for Greek, he begs to be excused. 
" If the study is doomed, let it die. Living 
is the test of vitality. ... If classical culture 
has outlived its usefulness ; if its teachers are 
squeaking and gibbering ghosts and not real 
men, let in the light, turn on the current and 
have done with it." One recalls the spirited 
words put into the mouth of the aged Cato by 
Cicero : " That is a wretched old age indeed 
which must defend itself by argument." The 
" cubic contents " of Greek studies, Professor 
Gildersleeve reminds us, are greater now than in 
past generations ; by which he means, of course, 
that the actual number so engaged is larger 
than before, in spite of the fact that they do not 
constitute so large a proportion of the entire 
body of students and scholars. The American, 
he holds, is essentially the Greek of the modern 
world. " Our keenness and directness, our 
audacity, our inventiveness, our light-hearted 
acceptance of the shifts of fortune," are quali- 
ties which peculiarly fit us to appreciate the life 
of ancient Greece and draw both profit and

pleasure from a first-hand acquaintance there- 
with. Dr. Gildersleeve's kindly humor, of 
course, pervades every paragraph. That will 
never depart until pen and tongue are stilled 
forever. 

Professor Mahaffy's Lowell Lectures on 
•• What Have the Greeks Done for Modern 
Civilization " are naturally more formal. In 
various important fields of human effort — 
prose and poetry, architecture and sculpture, 
painting and music, logic, mathematics, medi- 
cine, politics, law, philosophy, etc., — he points 
out the achievements of the Greeks and the 
direct or indirect relation of those achievements 
to modern efforts in the same lines. In general, 
this work is well and carefully done ; but we 
note a tendency unduly to depreciate the work 
of the Romans by way of comparison. Of 
course no Latinist denies the general artistic 
superiority of the Greek, through which he 
" took his fierce Roman conqueror captive," but 
that is a very superficial view of the evidence 
which fails to recognize that the Romans added 
substantial and valuable qualities of their own 
to all their borrowings from Greece, qualities 
without which modern life would have lost very 
heavily in its lessons from the ancient Mediter- 
ranean civilizations. It is not necessary to 
attempt here any resume of Professor Mahaffy's 
arguments, since intelligent readers are already 
aware of the general trend which such a discus- 
sion must take. Perhaps many would be sur- 
prised to read some of the definite information 
which he gives as to the extent of Greek achieve- 
ment in the field of higher mathematics. The 
present writer once heard a famous platform 
lecturer, the head of an educational institution 
in an Eastern city, assert to a body of students 
in a preparatory school that they knew more of 
science and mathematics than any of the ancient 
Greeks and Romans ! Few, of course, are as 
ignorant of the facts as that, but not many are 
aware how far one would have to go to pass the 
northernmost igloos of a Euclid, an Apollonius 
of Perga, an Hipparchus, or a Diophantus, in 
the polar latitudes of mathematics. The aver- 
age modern student preparing for such a feat 
would certainly find it necessary to dispense with 
many of the customary accoutrements of current 
college life and load his sledges with a high 
quality of intellectual pemmican instead. 

In discussing the subject of Greek music, 
Professor Mahaffy assumes that the idea of 
Greek educators that the practice of music has 
a direct and powerful effect upon the morals of 
average men is entirely foreign to modern 



thought. We have no sufficient acquaintance 
with modern musical literature to say whether 
this idea has had any very general discussion, 
but we have heard it put forth orally too often 
to believe that it can be as foreign to modern 
thought as he imagines. In fact, when we con- 
sider how readily certain types of music appeal 
to certain moods of mind, it would seem an inevi- 
table conclusion that either elevating or degrad- 
ing moral effects must be produced by this means 
under appropriate conditions. Who does not 
know how readily, in the field of church music, 
almost an entire audience may be jarred out of 
a spiritual frame of mind by some misplaced 
effort of organist or choir ? 

Professor Mahaffy is too plain-speaking a man 
to be insincere in his assertion that he found 
during his visit to America a far more hopeful 
situation with regard to Greek than he had 
expected. And we are glad that he was not 
afraid, within such close proximity to Harvard 
Square, to allude to the part of Harvard 
University itself in making the situation as 
bad as it is. We can do no better in closing 
than to quote the final sentence of our author's 
peroration : 

" So now, when my part in the race is nearly run, 
there remains to me no higher earthly satisfaction than 
this, that I have carried the torch of Greek fire alight 
through a long life — no higher earthly hope than this, 
that I may pass that torch to others, who in their turn 
may keep it aflame with greater brilliancy perhaps, but 
not with more earnest devotion, ' in the Parliament of 
man, the Federation of the world.' "

New Revealmexts of Shelley.* 



Seldom has the foolishness of prophesying been 
better illustrated than by Matthew Arnold's famous 
dictum of three decades ago : " I doubt whether 
Shelley's delightful Essays and Letters will not re- 
sist the wear and tear of time better and finally come 
to stand higher than his poetry." 

Certainly, we welcome gladly a collection of 
Shelley letters which includes thirty-eight entirely 
new ones, besides nearly fifty containing hitherto 
unpublished matter. Yet our enthusiasm is mild 
compared with what we should feel at the announce- 
ment of an equal number of fresh Shelley poems. 
However, a comparison of this kind is quite unneces- 
sary ; and we would not belittle what we now have, 
after eighty-seven years of waiting — a chronologi- 
cal and systematic arrangement of material which 
hitherto it has been necessary to seek through numer-

ous fragmentary and scattered volumes, the whole 
collection of old and new amounting to about four 
hundred and eighty letters, or nearly three times as 
many as any one previous work has contained. 
Moreover, the compact biographical sketches of 
Shelley's numerous friends and correspondents are 
of the greatest service in putting the reader en 
rapport with his environment ; the illustrations are 
mostly new, and the whole work of editing is admir- 
ably done. 

Naturally, the volume is richer in biographical 
than in critical interest. Concerning the moods, the 
motives, the impulses and surroundings that influ- 
enced the production of special poems, Shelley has 
little to say in these letters. But Mary Shelley's 
Notes to the early editions of the poems have made 
these as well known as any such matter can ever be 
made known to an outsider. What we do get, and 
are heartily glad to get, is considerable light upon 
two fundamental principles that perpetually chal- 
lenge discussion in the career of Shelley. To enter 
fully into his attitude of mind on these two points 
is absolutely necessary if anyone is to justify or even 
endure his course of conduct as a man, however he 
may be esteemed as a poet. These principles were : 
(1) Opinion should be absolutely free ; therefore no 
man should be arraigned by his fellow-men for any 
opinion. (2) Resolutely and consistently to act 
according to his own opinion is the duty of every 
man, and is the way in which he can best serve his 
fellow-men. To read the group of letters written 
by Shelley to his publisher and to other friends in 
the last month of the year 1817, when a young man 
of twenty-five, unknown to fame and seeking to get 
a poem of twelve cantos into print, is to realize the 
stuff of which he was made. " Laon and Cythna " — 
so the poem was called — so far outran the bounds 
of discretion in its utterances, moral, political, and 
theological, as to terrify the publisher and cause him 
to threaten to withdraw it after only three copies 
had been printed. Although he had no hope of 
another publisher, Shelley for a long time refused 
to alter a line of the poem. His eloquent letter of 
protest against the intended injustice of suppressing 
the book after it had been printed, brought the pub- 
lisher down to Marlow; a personal conference 
resulted in the cancelling of some pages, the altering 
of others, and the final publication of the poem as 
" The Revolt of Islam." The transaction is brought 
into high relief by placing the vigorous letters written 
at this period to different persons side by side, as 
well as by the addition of one entirely new letter. 
Thomas Moore had written kindly and encourag- 
ingly to the young author, and this was his reply : 

" The present edition of ' Laon and Cythna ' is to be sup- 
pressed, and it will be republished in about a fortnight under 
the title of ' The Revolt of Islam,' with some alterations 
which consist in little else than the substitution of the words 
friend and lover for that of brother and sister. The truth is that 
the seclusion of my habits has confined me so much within 
the circle of my own thoughts that I have formed to myself 
a very different measure of approbation or disapprobation 
for actions than that which is in use among mankind ; and 



the result of that peculiarity, contrary to my intention, re- 
volts and shocks many who might be inclined to sympathize 
with me in my general views. As soon as I discovered that 
this effect was produced by the circumstance alluded to, I 
hastened to cancel it — not from any personal feeling of 
terror or repentance, but from the sincere desire of doing 
all the good and conferring all the pleasure which might 
flow from so obscure a person as myself. I don't know why 
I trouble you with these words, but your kind approbation 
of the opening of the Poem has emboldened me to believe 
that the account of my motives might interest you." 

Five years earlier than this, Shelley, at the age of 
twenty, wrote thus to an unknown correspondent : 

" No human being is a member of the community, not as a 
limb is a member of the body, or as what is part of a ma- 
chine, intended only to contribute to some general joint re- 
sult. He was created not to be merged in the whole as a 
drop in the ocean, or as a particle of sand on the sea-shore, 
and to aid only in comprising a man. He is an ultimate be- 
ing, made for his own perfection as his highest end, made to 
maintain an individual existence, and to serve others only so 
far as consists with his own virtue and progress. . . . Noth- 
ing seems to me so needful as to give the mind the conscious- 
ness — which governments have done so much to suppress — 
of its own separate work. Let the individual feel that he 
is placed in the community not to part with his individual- 
ity, or to become a tool. To me, the progress of society 
consists in nothing more than in bringing out the individual, 
in giving him a consciousness of his own being, and in quick- 
ening him to strengthen and elevate his mind. 

" No man, I affirm, will serve his fellow-beings so effect- 
ually, so fervently, as he who is not their slave, — as he who, 
casting off every yoke, subjects himself to the law of duty 
in his own mind. For this law enjoins a disinterested and 
generous spirit. Individuality, or moral self-subsistence, is 
the secret foundation of an all-comprehending love. No 
man so multiplies his bonds with the community as he who 
watches most jealously over his own perfection. There is 
a beautiful harmony between the good of the State and the 
moral freedom and dignity of the individual. Were it not 
so, were these interests in any case discordant, were an indi- 
vidual ever called to serve his country by acts debasing his 
own mind, he ought not to waver a moment as to the good 
which he should prefer. Property, life, he should joyfully 
surrender to the State. But his soul he must never stain or 
enslave." 

On the great crux of Shelley biography — his 
elopement with Mary Godwin while still in appar- 
ently friendly relations with his wife Harriet — more 
opportunities than ever before in one place are offered 
for individual judgment. Harriet's letters to Mrs. 
Nugent, soon after the event, are collected in an 
Appendix ; and we know her view of the case as 
well as his. It becomes, indeed, far less easy to 
justify Shelley, or to endorse Dowden's opinion : 
" It is evident that in May, 1814 (the elopement took 
place in the July following), Harriet had assumed 
an attitude of hard alienation towards her husband 
who pleaded with almost despairing hope for the 
restoration of her love." It is true that Shelley left 
home and went to London about this time ; yet it 
looks like anything but " hard alienation " when we 
find that there was a continual correspondence kept 
up, — that on one occasion, four days having elapsed 
without a letter from Shelley, Harriet wrote an 
appealing letter to his publisher, saying, " It seems 
an age since I heard from him. . . . If I do not 
hear from you or from him I shall come to London. 
I cannot endure this dreadful state of suspense."

That she never intended to alienate herself from 
Shelley is plain from her pathetic account to Mrs. 
Nugent, and the desperate eagerness with which 
she seeks to shield Shelley by placing the blame 
elsewhere. 

" Mr. Shelley has become profligate and sensual, owing 
entirely to Godwin's ' Political Justice.' The very great evil 
that book has done is not to be told. . . . He cares not for 
me now. He never asks after me, or sends me word how he 
is going on. . . . Oh ! if you knew what I have suffered, 
your heart would drop blood for my miseries.'' 

With as much of the evidence before us as we 
are ever likely to have on the H Harriet question," it 
seems high time to banish at least one cruel injustice. 
Many of Shelley's biographers have placed the blame 
of separation on Harriet's unfaithfulness. The evi- 
dence of this vanishes into less than nothing, since 
it comes from prejudiced parties : and there is a good 
deal in disproof. Shelley's only justification, if justi- 
fication there be. must be found in his views of mar- 
riage, as expressed in " Queen Mab " and often in 
his letters. Very early he had become a disciple of 
Godwin, and had accepted entirely Godwin's belief 
that u The institution of marriage is a system of 
fraud. . . . Marriage is a law. and the worst of 
laws." Shelley greatly desired the union of his 
friend Hogg with his beloved sister Elizabeth ; yet 
he wrote to Hogg : 

" Matrimony. I know, is a word dear to you ; does it vibrate 
in unison with the hidden strings of rapture — awaken divine 
anticipation ? Is it not the most horrible of all the means 
which the world has had recourse to, to bind the noble to 
itself ? Yet this is the subject of her constant and printed 
panegyric. It is in vain that I seek to talk to her [Elizabeth]. 
It is in vain that I represent, or rather endeavor to represent, 
the futility of the world's opinion." 

The last words explain much of Shelley, and of his 
conduct, which at least was founded upon conviction. 
The u futility of the world's opinion " carried no 
restraint with him ; if he loved another person more, 
marriage was no reason for remaining with one less 
loved. 

In general it may be said of these letters that they 
do not materially alter our impressions of Shelley's 
character. The qualities of decision, promptness of 
resource and action, of generosity, of self-forgetful 
interest in others, general kindliness, and courtesy, 
come out with increased force. A new light seems 
thrown upon him in the capacity of a business man. 
We see him negotiating, transacting, advising, con- 
trolling, treating the business of life in a business- 
like way, though not blind to the fact that he was 
unconscionably ''worked" by the insatiable Godwin. 
In one of the last letters he ever wrote, he said : "I 
have been long firmly persuaded that all the money 
advanced to Godwin, so long as he stands engaged 
in business, is absolutely thrown away." 

Shelley's religion, or absence of religion, has been 
so often discussed, his belief in immortality has been 
so often denied, that we cannot refrain from quoting 
one very explicit statement in a letter dated 1811 : 

" Shall we sink into the nothing from which we have arisen? 
But could we have arisen from nothing? We put an acorn into 
the ground. In process of time it modifies the particles of 



earth, air, and water, by infinitesimal division, so as to pro- 
duce an oak. That power which makes it to be this oak we 
may call its vegetative principle, symbolizing with the animal 
principle, or soul of animated existence. An hundred years 
pass. The oak moulders in putrefaction — it ceases to be 
what it is ; its soul is gone. Is soul then annihilable? Yet 
one of the properties of animal soul is consciousness of iden- 
tity. If this is destroyed, in consequence the soul (whose 
essence this is) must perish. But as I conceive (and as is 
certainly capable of demonstration) that nothing can be an- 
nihilated, but that everything appertaining to nature, con- 
sisting of constituent parts infinitely divisible, is in a con- 
tinual change, then do I suppose — and I think I have a 
right to draw this inference — that neither will soul perish ; 
that in a future existence it will lose all consciousness of 
having formerly lived elsewhere, — will begin life anew, 
possibly under a shape of which we have now no idea. But we 
have no right to make hypotheses — this is not one ; at least 
I flatter myself that I have kept clear of the supposition."'

Recent Fiction.* 



Ann Veronica is a young woman who chafes un- 
der the conditions which life would impose upon her. 
She lives in a suburb with her father, a prosperous 
man of affairs in the City, and a maiden aunt who 
cherishes sentimental memories. There are brothers 
and sisters, but they are married or otherwise away, 
and do not count. Ann Veronica studies biology in a 
London school, and her father shakes his head at the 
presumably godless character of her instruction. 
She also gets unconventional ideas from a little group 
of art students with whom she mingles. She is a rest- 
less girl, who is ambitious to "live her own life," 
and is refreshingly free of speech. " Damn ! " 
" Oh, cuss it ! " and " That 's the devil of it," may be 
offered as selected quotations. No wonder her lover 
remarks, u You do use vile language " — not reprov- 
ingly, but as a statement of objective fact. But this 
is anticipatory ; for when we meet her, she has no 
lover, although she yearns for one. A domestic crisis 
is reached when her father forbids her to go to a 
costume ball given by her art student friends. She 
plans to go just the same, if for nothing more than 
to assert her rights as an individual ; but is caught 
escaping from the house, and ignominiously locked 
up in her room. This is " tu mutch," and she flees

to London in outraged dignity. Taking cheap lodg- 
ings, she sets ahout " living her own life " in fact, 
and discovers it to he a difficult matter. Her ser- 
vices do not seem to be greatly desired, and she fin- 
ally borrows forty pounds from an elderly stock- 
broker with bulging eyes who professes solicitude 
for her welfare. He naturally expects payment after 
the fashion of his kind; and this episode leads to a 
scene in a cabinet particulier which is — well, we 
hesitate to say what it is, beyond expressing the 
opinion that it goes beyond what is legitimate in 
decent fiction. With the borrowed money, Ann 
Veronica pays her fees in the laboratory, and per- 
sues her studies under the direction of a young biolo- 
giat named Capes, who has a wife and a shady past. 
She concludes that she is in love with him, and, 
nothing abashed, tells him so. He makes difficulties, 
still having some sparks of decency in his nature ; 
but she is determined, and off they go to Switzer- 
land. Meanwhile, Ann Veronica's experience with 
the stockbroker has aroused an indignation that 
must find vent somehow, and the thing nearest at 
hand for Ann Veronica is to beceme a suffragette, 
which she does so successfully that she is soon enjoy- 
ing a fortnight of enforced seclusion from the world. 
Then comes the Swiss escapade with its delirious 
joys. And finally, skipping several years, we are 
given an epilogue showing the couple living happily 
together as Mr. and Mrs. Capes. We infer from 
this that the former Mrs. Capes has made some sort 
of an end, although the author delicately refrains 
from mentioning the fact. Capes, who has deserted 
biology, is now a prosperous dramatist. Meeting 
his father-in-law one day, he introduces himself and 
invites him to dinner. The affair goes off very 
well, and when their guest has departed, Ann 
Veronica says to her husband : 

" To think that is my father ! Oh, my dear ! He stood 
over me like a cliff ; the thought of him nearly turned me 
aside from everything we have done, He was the social 
order ; he was law and wisdom. And they come here, and 
they look at our furniture to see if it is good ; and they are 
not glad, it does not stir them, that at last, at last we can 
dare to have children." 

The modern young woman is a restless creature, no 
doubt, and Mr. Wells knows some things about her. 
But if we thought him serious in offering this par- 
ticular specimen for our approval, we should straight- 
way, in preference, declare for the young women of 
Jane Austen's world. They at least recognized 
something higher than the law of individual impulse. 
But we cannot take Mr. Wells very seriously, or find 
much more than good fun in his account of Ann 
Veronica. We should have to call this his latest 
story one of the most immoral, if it were not obvi- 
ously one of the larkiest, of books. 

An instructive contrast to Mr. Wells's audacity of 
invention is provided by Mr. A. E. Jacomb's " The 
Faith of His Fathers," which is also a story of revolt, 
— a plea for the claims of the new generation against 
the crusted prejudices of the old, — but is conceived 
in a spirit of sympathy and reverence, not one of 



scorn and recklessness. The revolt which it portrays 
is a reaction against the drab puritanism which 
frowns upon all pleasure as sinful, which holds in 
dark suspicion every natural motion of the human 
spirit toward light and cheer. It is a novel of pro- 
vincial England, dated, we should say, some time 
ago, although survivals of the austere and dogmatic 
idealism which supplies its motive may possibly yet 
be found in out-of-the-way communities. Here is a 
father, a leader of some such narrow sect as the Ply- 
mouth Brethren, unswervingly conscientious in his 
own light, who well-nigh ruins the lives of his chil- 
dren by the sternness of his discipline. The son, 
forced to marry the girl whom he has seduced, drags 
out a wretched life which ends in crime and a prison 
sentence. The daughter, forbidden to marry the man 
she loves because he does not accept the tenets of the 
sect, is made miserable by the interposition of this 
unreal obstacle in the path of her happiness, and 
asserts her rights as an individual only at the cost of 
family estrangement. Even the long-suffering wife 
gives way in the end, and, after a lifetime of self- 
repression, turns upon her husband, saying, " I hate 
you ! I hate you and your religion ! " But we, 
seeing with more objective eyes the man who has 
wrought all this calamity, cannot withhold a consider- 
able measure of sympathy from one who is so sincere, 
even if so intellectually at fault. He stands unshaken, 
a sort of minor replica of Ibsen's " Brand," as the 
moral avalanche for which he is responsible descends 
upon him, and his uncompromising fortitude makes 
of him the one heroic figure of the narrative. 
Throughout this conflict of ideals there is always 
recognized the principle, of which we can find no 
evidence in the conflict of " Ann Veronica," that 
the controlling force in every soberly-ordered life 
must be something more deserving of respect than 
the individual will, something that bears a higher 
mandate than even the most passionate desire for 
personal happiness. The man who forsakes " the 
faith of his fathers " is bound to see to it that the 
substitute he provides is no less morally effective, 
and is something more than a mere cloak for self- 
indulgence. 

The atmosphere of Egyptian life is reproduced 
for us with quite extraordinary effect by Mr. Robert 
Hichens in his latest novel. In this respect, a com- 
parison with Mr. Hall Caine's efforts, or even with 
those of Sir Gilbert Parker, is so far in favor of 
the author of " Bella Donna " as to make such books 
as "The White Prophet" and "The Weavers" 
seem garish and tawdry. But we can hardly call it 
a pleasant tale for which Mr. Hichens has provided 
so wonderful a setting. A woman whose past is 
more than dubious, but who has the power to affect 
injured innocence, is looking about London society 
for a new victim, and finds him in the person of an 
idealist of quixotic temperament, whose chivalrous 
instincts are so aroused by the slanders heaped upon 
her that he asks her to become his wife. This is 
precisely her game; for her affairs are desperate,

and he is, besides, an excellent parti, being the pro- 
spective heir to a title and estates. It so happens 
that his work is in Egypt — a work of agricultural 
reclamation — and thither he takes his bride. His 
friends, meanwhile, are aghast at the way in which 
he has been duped, and one of them, a keen-sighted 
physician, determines to keep his eyes open. The 
scene now shifts to Egypt, where the discomforts of 
existence makes it hard for the wife to keep up the de- 
ception of even so credulous a person as her husband. 
When his prospects of a title vanish, she becomes 
reckless and throws herself into the arms of a native 
potentate, whose sensual nature matches her own, 
and who is the possessor of great wealth. Keeping 
up the pretence of wifely devotion, she not only 
betrays her husband, but sets about getting rid of 
him by means of poison, slowly and subtly admin- 
istered. His robust health breaks down under the 
treatment, and he is almost at the point of death 
when the physician friend (whose suspicions have 
become aroused), journeys post-haste from the 
Thames to the Nile, takes a hand in the plot, rescues 
the man, and opens his eyes to the doings of the 
would-be murderess. Finally, poetic justice is sat- 
isfied when the latter flies to her Egyptian lover, 
only to be spurned by him as a cast-off toy. It is 
not, as we said before, a pleasant story : but it is one 
of vivid description and characterization, and of 
marked power to hold the interest. 

Mr. Albert E. Hancock is the author of " Bronson 
of the Rabble," a historical novel of early American 
life, covering the period from the War of 1812 to 
the first election of President Jackson. The hero 
is a youth of the people — " the rabble," as it is 
contemptuously styled in the circles of wealth and 
breeding — who distinguishes himself in the Battle 
of Lake Erie, and afterwards becomes a political 
leader and newspaper editor in Philadelphia. His 
story, although not devoid of the private and senti- 
mental interest which readers have a right to expect, 
is essentially a portrayal of American life in its 
formative stage, in the period which witnessed the 
emergence of democracy from a society that had 
been mainly controlled by aristocratic ideals and 
influences. The author is almost fiercely partisan in 
championship of the new spirit then making itself 
felt, and takes a whack at the Federalists upon every 
possible occasion. He has only words of praise for 
the war in which America took the part of the arch- 
enemy of liberty, and only scorn for the movement 
which led to the Hartford Convention. He carries 
contempt for John Quincy Adams to an extreme, 
and accepts the legend of the '• corrupt bargain " 
whereby Jackson was defeated in 1824. The 
triumph of democracy four years later is the climax 
of the novel. While we think Mr. Hancock's view 
unfairly colored by prejudice, we cannot deny the 
vigor and interest of his work, or the unusual char- 
acter of his historical and antiquarian equipment. 
His book is fairly comparable with the works of his 
fellow-townsman. Dr. Weir Mitchell, for knowledge 
and sound literary workmanship. 



'• My Lady of the South," by Mr. Randall Parrish, 
provides a sort of complement to " My Lady of the 
North," by the same novelist. Hero and heroine 
are merely reversed in their sympathies, and other- 
wise the stock situation is the same. It is a situa- 
tion of perennial interest to American readers, and 
in the hands of as capable an entertainer as Mr. 
Parrish it requires no apology for another treatment. 
The present story is compactly knit, and the entire 
action covers only a few days, all spent in and around 
an old Kentucky home. The heroine is about to be 
forced into a distasteful marriage, when the hero 
appears, and, under cover of darkness, passes himself 
off as the bridegroom, contracting a midnight mar- 
riage. The obvious difficulties of this situation are 
ingeniously met, and we are prepared for the eclair- 
cissement and the softening of the young woman's 
rebel heart. Days of excitement follow, for the 
house becomes a scene of raids and forays, of excur- 
sions and alarms, during which both hero and heroine 
exchange several times the characters of captor and 
captive. There are secret tunnels in which mysterious 
murders take place, and there is a concealed family 
maniac to account for these deeds of blood. There 
is also a feud, of which the dramatic possibilities are 
exploited to exciting effect. The story is as good as 
the best that the author has ever given us. 

The simple and appealing tale of a baby found- 
ling, whose parentage is at last happily discovered, 
is told by Mr. Jay Cady in *' The Moving of the 
Waters." It is a tale of the Mississippi, and the 
child grows up in the rude house-boat of a wooden- 
legged fisherman. One day she flags a train that is 
rushing to distraction, and thereby becomes a heroine 
in the literal sense. This brings her into notice, and 
sets in action the machinery whereby her secret is 
disclosed. It also provides a suitable hero in the 
person of the young physician who looks after her 
when she is injured in her life-saving adventure. 
The scene then shifts to St Louis, where the threads 
of the mystery are gradually untangled. There are 
several quaint and lovable characters, besides those 
already mentioned, and the whole story is delicate in 
feeling and charming in sentiment 

Tales of treasure-hunting have a perennial charm. 
The tale called ■ The Treasure," which Mr. Paul W. 
Eaton has provided for our delectable excitement, 
is concerned with no less a booty than the pirate 
hoard of Captain Kidd, which was buried by the 
redoubtable buccaneer upon one of the islands in 
Casco Bay. The inevitable manuscript provides a 
clue to the hiding-place, but there is a rival claimant 
in the person of one of Kidd's descendants, who has 
allied himself with an Englishman, a pirate himself, 
but posing as a British privateersman in the War of 
1812. Thus history is interwoven with romance, 
and we are regaled, among other matters, with an 
account of the burning of Washington by the British 
in 1814. It is a fairly well-written yarn, which 
brings the villain to a suitable end, and the heroine

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



If anything is equal to a good story about pirates 
and buried treasure, it is a good detective story ; and 
Mr. Cleveland Moffett has written one of the best 
that have come to us in recent years. It is a Parisian 
tale, much after the manner of Gaboriau, and deals 
with the unmasking of an arch-villain of wealth so 
enormous that he is able to control the very mach- 
inery of justice, and thwart the detective-hero at 
every turn. He knows that Paul Coquenil is the 
only man whom he has to fear, and attempts, by 
flattering offers from South America, to secure his 
removal from the scene. But Paul refuses the bait, 
after nibbling at it, and remains in Paris, to the dis- 
comfiture of the criminal, after the wits of the two 
have been pitted against each other in a long game 
of check and countercheck. " Through the Wall " 
is the title of this exciting and absorbing tale. 

"The Silver Horde" which supplies the motive 
of Mr. Rex Beach's latest Alaskan story, is a pic- 
turesque designation of the salmon that congest the 
northern rivers at a certain season of the year. The 
hero, who has been down and out for some time, 
finds new opportunity beckoning to him in the shape 
of a cannery, and proeeeds to organize a company 
and lay plans for the acquisition of the fortune that 
shall win for him the love of the girl to whose service 
he has long been devoted. She is the daughter of 
a Chicago magnate who at just this time is organiz- 
ing a trust to control all the salmon fisheries of the 
Pacific Coast. This brings the hero and his pro- 
spective father-in-law into violent collision, and the 
warfare that follows makes up the substance of the 
story. The hero is successful, of course, after over- 
coming exaggerated and incredible obstacles, but in 
the progress of these events his affections are trans- 
ferred to a young woman of somewhat dubious past, 
whom he meets in Alaska, and whose loyal support 
and self-sacrifice are the most important factors in 
his triumph. The story is highly-colored melo- 
drama, violent in action, and with little claim to 
serious consideration. It presents certain phases of 
the rough Alaskan life with vivid forcefulness, but 
of the finer graces of fictive art it is wholly innocent.

Briefs on New Books. 



A quiet man's book for quiet people 

iSSU a pp ears from Mi - E - M - Martin ' s 

pen under the pleasantly alliterative 
title, "Wayside Wisdom" (Longmans). Availing 
himself of the intimate essayist's privilege, the author 
speaks throughout in the first person singular, and 
reveals himself with some distinctness to the reader 
in the end. He appears to us as a book-loving book- 
seller, printing in the back of his house the volumes 
he sells in the front, — a disciple of William Morris, 
one conjectures, and making a fine art out of what 
would else be a trade. But there is little of book- 
ishness in his chapters, which deal with such matters 



as old superstitions, rural life, the advantages of 
poverty, the smoke of cities, travelling, being in love, 
the vanity of learning, living alone, growing old, 
death, and a few others. The chapter on "Some 
Old Superstitions " makes the oldest of these to be 
the superstitions of sound. One would have said 
the visible ghost, the apparition, was older than " the 
calling voices." But who knows? In connection 
with solitary living, the author quotes from an un- 
named source : " Silent men are kings, for they rule 
over a great country where none can follow them." 
But the assertion that follows, a little later, that " it 
is a law of our being that we live alone," must refer 
to spiritual solitude, not physical. The very first 
essay, on " Wayside Wisdom," quotes the contempt- 
uous definition of proverbs ( " milestones on the 
pathway of fools") only to dissent from it, very 
properly. The writer's style is agreeable and fluent. 
On the opening page stands a little example of per- 
versity that is often met with in current literature. 
Why will writers use " still less " for " still more," 
and vice versa ? Here is the sentence : " There is 
a grace, even a virtue, in doing nothing ; but so un- 
accustomed are we to its practice, still less its praise, 
that at first this very old truth sounds like some new 
thing." Six of the essays have already appeared 
in " The Gentleman's Magazine " (one of the six 
being rewritten for the book), and the remaining 
eleven are new. 

Pepys's Diary will always be the best 
Old Pepv* ' commentary on its author ; whatever 

others say can be based only on that 
most fascinating of self-revealing documents. So 
when Mr. E. Hallam Moorehouse writes on " Samuel 
Pepys, Administrator, Observer, Gossip" (Dutton), 
he puts before us when he can the Pepys of the 
Diary, and when he cannot he has to be content with 
the formal documents consciously prepared for pub- 
lication. The book aims to give the domestic and 
historical setting in which Pepys's activity was 
placed, and in this it forms a useful commentary on 
the Diary. It does not take its place — no work 
could do that — but it forms a very good introduc- 
tion ; it enables one unfamiliar with the events and 
persons of the time to read the work itself with 
greater intelligence. The author has caught Pepys's 
spirit admirably ; in fact, in his zeal as Pepys's de- 
fender he seems to exaggerate the unfavorable criti- 
cism on the poor sinner, as if we were all Puritans 
and there were to be no more cakes and ale. The 
charming naivete" of the man goes far to atone for 
his embracing Deb Willet ; and surely his repent- 
ance should cause him to find favor in the sight of 
the most proper individual, when he could as a light 
affliction endure Will Hewer, his wife's authorized 
detective, who " goes up and down with me like a 
jaylour, but yet with great love and to my good 
liking it being my desire above all things to please 
my wife therein." Mr. Moorehouse brings out in a 
very favorable and just light Pepys's fine admin- 
istrative ability, his splendid showing before the

House of Commons, his remarkably effective work 
as Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty 
in conducting the affairs of the navy, drawing for 
this upon the Diary and official documents. And 
there is, too, the Pepys of the Bibliotheca Pepysiana, 
that graces and enriches Magdalen College, Cam-

prattles about all sorts of persons, from the servant 
whom he was seen to kick, to his chief whom he 
righteously reproves and his king of whom he sin- 
cerely disapproves ; he is introduced to us here that 
we may go to the Diary to know him as we can know 
few men, as we hardly dare know ourselves. 

The uhite mans That " the white man ' S bu . rd . en " S*^' 

burden, and Us is often evident. The willingness to 
galling curse. assume it has never been more nota- 
bly shown than by Britain. The needs of British 
trade lie in the direction of the policy of burden- 
assumption. Exploitation and elevation — at least 
in theory — go hand in hand ; and wherever we find 
the white man taking up his burden and working the 
lower races for his profit and their welfare, we also 
find chafing and sores. Just now, South Africa pre- 
sents serious problems. What is to be done with the 
native ? How is he to be worked ? How is he to be 
protected ? How can he be worked and still protected ? 
To such problems the work on " South African 
Natives " ( Dutton) is devoted. In South Africa are 
tribes so badly needing elevation that for their uplift 
Britain has taken possession. True, the bind offered 
agricultural opportunity, and mines of gold and dia- 
monds. In assuming the burden, and incidentally 
getting the land and mines, there has been injustice 
to the natives : there always is. And hence there 
is the South African Races Committee, composed 
of estimable gentlemen who have some conscience. 
They acquiesce in the necessity of burden-bearing, 
but desire to reduce the native suffering and the 
overlord's injustice to a minimum. Their Report 
discusses such topics as The Labor Question, Land 
Tenure, Taxation, Administration, Legal Status, 
Education, The Ethiopian Movement. The need of 
a watchful committee is amply demonstrated by the 
facts presented and the discussion of them. Within 
a few decades the Bantu native, well adapted to and 
fairly utilizing his environmental resources, has been 
dispossessed. He can no longer gain a living in his 
own natural and simple fashion ; he must be so man- 
aged and manipulated as to supply a continuous and 
usable labor force for mine and farm ; where his 
fathers were owners, he may no longer hold land, or 
only under strange and new restraints ; he is subject 
to heavy taxation, often amounting to coercion to 
labor for the benefit of aliens — for his own eleva- 
tion, of course ; his legal status is uncertain, often 
disadvantageous ; his education but qualifies him the 
better to serve his overlords. These and many other 
interesting facts emerge from the careful reading of 
this Report, which on the whole is optimistic regard- 
ing the future. Not the least interesting chapter 
deals with "The Ethiopian Movement." In the 



native churches, in the section of population most 
tolerant of and affected by ameliorative influences, 
signs of revolt appear. Even the Christian natives 
are becoming restless, and prefer to elevate them- 
selves rather than to be further elevated. Probably 
the political significance of the " movement " has 
been exaggerated (as is here claimed) ; but it is an 
interesting symptom, encouraging and wholesome, 
though not reassuring to the burden-bearing white 



Chapter* of 
Xew York's 
early history 



The trading-post established by the 
Dutch on the island of Manhattan, 
at the mouth of the Hudson River, 
in 1610-13, presented to the student some interest- 
ing phases of colonial history in the seventeenth cen- 
tury, and before the settlement began to give any 
sign or promise of ever becoming one of the world's 
great cities. Not until 1633 was it regarded as of 
sufficient importance to receive the name of New 
Amsterdam. Twenty years later it acquired a form 
of municipal government from Governor Stuy vesant, 
who in 1664 surrendered the city to Governor 
Nicolls of New England ; and its name was changed 
to New York. In 1673 the city was recaptured by 
the Dutch as an incident of the war between France 
and England and Holland, and its name was again 
changed, this time to New Orange. It was restored 
to England by the Treaty of Westminster the fol- 
lowing year, and resumed its former name of New 
York. It received, in 1686, the famous Dongan 
Charter, which was the basis of a plan of govern- 
ment for the great city which it has since become. 
Within a few years, and before the close of the 
seventeenth century, at the time of the accession of 
William and Mary, it was the scene of an effort to 
establish popular government, led by Jacob Leisler, 
which resulted in the execution of Leisler and one 
of his supporters on the charge of high treason. 
Such, in outline, are the materials for Mrs. Schuyler 
Van Rensselaer's "History of the City of New York 
in the Seventeenth Century " (Macmillan), a work 
in two volumes, aggregating nearly twelve hundred 
pages, and illustrated by two frontispiece maps. 
The volumes treat of "New Amsterdam" and " New 
York under the Stuarts " respectively. The author's 
thoroughness is attested by the long lost of authorities 
consulted, at the end of each chapter ; some of them 
original documents or rare books to be found only 
in the New York Society Library, to which library 
she pays a high tribute. The author has, however, 
presented no complete bibliography of the history of 
New York in these lists, having excluded some well- 
known books because of their inaccuracy of state- 
ment and their tendency to mislead the serious 
student. Under this rule, Irving's " Knickerbocker 
History " is excluded, because, although written as 
a jest, it has been accepted as a history of a period 
with which no historian had yet familiarized the 
public ; and it has served to give an erroneous bias 
even to serious historians in later times. It is the 
effort to correct this that has apparently given to

Mrs. Van Rensselaer the zest with which she writes 
her account of New Amsterdam and its people. And 
her account of the Dutch suffers not at all in inter- 
est by comparison with Irving's because written in 
more serious style. Mrs. Van Rensselaer believes 
Leisler, about whom students of history have quar- 
relled more than about any other colonial character, 
and upon whose career her second volume chiefly 
centres, to have been neither villain nor martyr, but 
a patriot born under a hapless star ; and she notes, 
as one of the effects of the Leislerian episode, the 
rise of parties which gradually found wider range 
of interest than merely local ones, and eventually 
became the Patriots and Tories of Revolutionary 
times. Mrs. Van Rensselaer's work is well done, 
and her volumes are valuable contributions to our 
historical literature. All who read them will look 
forward with interest to the two additional volumes 
which will carry the story of the city's growth 
through the later Colonial and Revolutionary periods 
down to the year when New York was the capital 
of the nation and witnessed the inauguration of the 
first President of the United States. 



Somepopuiar Mr ' Garrett P. Serviss, who is known 
astronomy for as one of the most prolific of writers 
the curious. Q f p p U l ar books on astronomical 

themes, has until recently devoted himself chiefly to 
exploiting the wonders of the sky as revealed by 
small telescopes, striving to make his readers better 
acquainted with the constellations and the chief 
objects of interest in them. But his latest book, 
" Curiosities of the Sky " (Harper), has a widely 
different trend, being a popular discussion of various 
interesting matters on which astronomical research 
has recently thrown light. The book consists of four- 
teen separate essays of about twenty pages each. 
The first half-dozen of these are upon the distant 
realms which are tenanted by the fixed stars and 
nebulae. The mysteries of the Milky Way, the migra- 
tions of the stars — which will eventually lead to 
the dismemberment of the constellations — the flam- 
ing forth of new stars, and the new views of the 
nebulae which are brought out by the triumphs of 
modern photography, are all discussed in entertain- 
ing fashion. The remaining eight essays are devoted 
to topics connected with the solar system. Those 
on which modern developments in the science of 
physics have thrown especial light, such as the sun's 
corona, the zodiacal light, and auroras, receive es- 
pecial attention. Mars, the moon, and the asteroids, 
are also treated in a fashion as unhackneyed as one 
can reasonably expect. The illustrations include 
thirty-six full-page plates, most of which are of 
unusual excellence. 

" Man is man, A . volume that has passed through 
and master thirty editions in fifteen years, on so 

of Ms fate." apparently trite a subject as the Edu- 

cation of the "Will, must certainly have found the 
secret of a popular appeal. This and more may be 
said of Dr. Jules Payot's volume which has just ap- 



peared in English form (Funk & Wagnalls) . Though 
not so aptly suited to the needs of English readers, 
yet the common human nature to which the book 
appeals, and the admirably direct and fresh attack 
of the subject, will justify many an edition in En- 
glish. The book is fortunately free from the hack- 
neyed academic treatment of problems apart from 
their concrete setting, and equally from the undue 
simplification which solves all the loose knots but 
leaves the tight ones as badly tangled as ever. The 
text of the discourse remains the same : the inherent 
laziness of the human kind, the necessity of vitalizing 
ideas with true and clean motives, and the absolutely 
frank, almost confessional, attitude which self- 
examination requires. In setting forth the elemental 
place of action in the human life, M. Payot is not 
quite as brilliant as Professor James, but his task is 
differently conceived and no less practically exe- 
cuted. Such chapter headings as " Day-dreams and 
Sensuality " and " Sophisms of the Indolent," and 
the influences of the " Departed Great," suggest the 
trend of the book ; while the pertinent use of every- 
day examples and of helpful analogy further drives 
home the moral which even a tale unadorned might 
forcibly point. Those who are looking for such aids 
and inspiration as a plain book may give to plain 
people will find few writings more to their taste and 
need than this acceptable volume. Its appeal is not 
alone to teachers and those who have to do with 
training, but likewise to the larger mass who aspire 
to be in some measure masters of their fate. 



Davis's travels In 1803 there waS published _ in 
in America London an octavo volume bearing 

a century ago. the title> "Travels of Four Years 

and a Half in the United States of America ; During 
1798, 1799, 1800, 1801, and 1802." One John 
Davis, possibly descended from the celebrated navi- 
gator of that name (for this John had followed the 
sea from his twelfth year), was the author, and he 
dedicated his work, by permission, to President 
Jefferson. This interesting and little-known book 
is now republished by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., 
with an introduction and footnotes by Mr. A. J. 
Morrison. A peculiar interest attaches to this work 
because its author was a self-educated man of letters, 
awake to the literary promise of our country and on 
the alert for literary material for his own use. He 
speaks of having with him on shipboard a library 
of nearly three hundred volumes, and adds : " The 
Muses, whom I never ceased to woo, blessed me, I 
thought, not infrequently, with their nightly visita- 
tions ; and I soothed my mind to tranquillity with 
the fancied harmony of my verse." Landing at 
New York after a ten weeks' voyage in " a Snow of 
two hundred tons," the traveller soon proceeded 
southward, to Philadelphia and beyond, walking 
most of the way, and supporting himself by writing 
and tutoring. He is pleasantly free from the super- 
cilious and censorious spirit of certain other early 
visitors to the United States, and his observations,

though betraying no remarkable acumen or pro- 
fundity, are genuine and refreshing. Now and 
then, too, he favors his readers with a set of verses 
inspired by the new scenes. On the whole, it is a 
most agreeable book. 

To interpret the primitive and seem- 
The hard life ingly contradictory wants and aspira- 
tions of young people of industrial 
centres, to discover the soul of goodness in things 
evil, to summon the ambitions of generous youth to 
the service of universal justice, is the task which 
Miss Jane Addams has set herself in her latest book, 
" The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets " (Mac- 
millan). The spectacle of thwarted hope, of muti- 
lated affections, of perverted souls, lends these pages 
of Miss Addams's a touch of sadness. There may 
be more enthusiasm for justice outside the circles of 
Halsted Street immigrants than she discovers ; but 
we cannot blame her for reporting what she sees. 
We might ask rather more precise and concrete 
advice as to the actual methods we ought to use, 
those with which the daily struggles of the author 
make her so familiar; but one must be adamant who 
does not, after reading this little book, search his 
own conscience, and, what is better, go forth in quest 
of adventures on behalf of the oppressed and the 
spiritually starved. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Useful Fiction catalogues, marking the initial step in 
carrying out the A. L. A. plan of making cooperatively 
printed catalogues, as outlined before the Minnetonka 
meeting of the Association, have been published by the 
H. W. Wilson Co., of Minneapolis. A list of about 2000 
titles is printed, with both author and title entries, and 
frequent brief annotations, in a pamphlet of 147 pages, 
while shorter lists, of 1200 and 800 titles, are also issued. 
It is the publishers' design " to furnish to librarians and 
library patrons a near-at-hand substitute for the heavily 
alphabeted card catalog. From it small libraries may 
check their fiction titles, and have their catalogs, any 
number necessary, made up from slugs kept at head- 
quarters." Good authorities have been consulted in the 
compilation of these lists, and they are inexpensive as 
well as serviceable. 

The multiplication of books of selected readings, com- 
piled to provide material for the study of important 
subjects at their sources, is one of the most character- 
istic of educational publishing activities at the present 
time. History and literature having been fairly well 
covered by books of this sort, the movement is now being 
extended into the domains of social and political science, 
and now, by Dr. Benjamin Rand, into those of ethics 
and philosophy. For Dr. Rand's " Modern Classical 
Philosophers," published not long ago, a companion 
volume of " The Classical Moralists " is now provided. 
It is a large volume of eight hundred pages, represent- 
ing all the great ethical thinkers of ancient and modern 
times, and amounts practically to a history of the sub- 
ject in the very words of those who have created it. 
Such works as this are of very great usefulness, and the 
present example is one of the best of its kind. 



An edition of TegneVs " Frithiof's Saga," edited by 
Professor George T. Flom, is published by the Engberg- 
Hobnberg Publishing Co., Chicago. The work is pri- 
marily a gift-book, reproducing a Swedish edition 
adorned with many attractive illustrations. The editor 
has fitted it for use as a language-text by furnishing the 
customary apparatus of introduction, bibliography, and 
notes. He also reprints TegneVs " Anmarkningar " 
concerning the poem, as well as several of the author's 
letters about it. The special feature of this edition is 
the introduction, which deals with TegneVs literary de- 
velopment, the sources and genesis of the poem, and the 
translations into other languages. This bibliography of 
the translations is very valuable, and it must have cost 
the editor much labor to collect the facts. 



Notes. 



We welcome another good source-book for the use of 
teachers of history. This time it is " A Source History 
of the United States,'' prepared by Professors H. W. 
Caldwell and C. E. Persinger, and published by Messrs. 
Ainsworth & Co. It is a book for high schools, and the 
extracts given are boiled down to their essentials by 
omission of all but the most significant passages. 

The latest addition to the " Musician's Library " of 
the Oliver Ditson Co. is a volume of " Songs from the 
Operas for Alto," edited by Mr. H E. Krehbiel. Twenty- 
two composers are represented by twenty-nine songs. 
There are few really great songs in this collection, for 
the alto voice does not get the lyrical prizes, but Gluck's 
" Che Faro " is alone good to bring up the average. The 
editor's explanatory notes are helpful and interesting. 

Dr. Samuel B. Harding's volume of " Select Orations 
Illustrating American Political History " (Macmillan) 
offers a valuable aid to both teacher and student. The 
orations are for the most part abridged or represented 
by fragments, which makes it possible to give examples 
from thirty-four men, from Otis and Henry to Carl 
Schurz and Mr. Booker T. Washington. An essay on 
" Oratorical Style and Structure," by Professor John M. 
Clapp, prefaces the selection. 

" Fifty Songs by Hugo Wolf," edited by Mr. Ernest 
Newman, form a new volume of the " Musician's Library," 
published by the Oliver Ditson Co. They are arranged 
for high voice, and accompanied by the editorial appara- 
tus customary with the books of this series. Most of 
the fifty are included within four groups, one Spanish, 
one Italian, and one each composed for texts by Morike 
and Goethe. The same publishers send us ■ Echoes of 
Naples," being thirty Neapolitan songs edited by Signor 
Mario Favelli,and a volume of exercises in "Hand Expan- 
sions and Contractions," by Mr. E. R. Kroeger. 

" The Great English Essayists," edited by Messrs. 
W. J. and C. W. Dawson, is a new volume in " The 
Reader's Library," published by Messrs. Harper & 
Brothers. Nearly half a hundred essays, or parts of 
essays, are given, grouped under the following six heads : 
" The Classic Essay," " The Letter Essay," " The Short- 
Story Essay," " The Biographical and Critical Essay," 
" Impassioned Prose," and " The Familiar Essay." 
Each group has an editorial essay by way of introduction. 
All of which makes a pleasing book of very good read- 
ing, so put together that its several parts serve to illu- 
minate one another as well as the general theme of the 
work as a whole.

Size of plates 14x18 inches 

" The portrait [Abraham Lincoln] is an admirable one, and the etch- 
ing is as striking and strong as those which have preceded it. The 
rugged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the 
deep lines of care that farrow the brow are significant of the period of 
storm and stress." — Netc York Herald. 

" Thx Whits Hocsk. Washington, Febr. 2, 1909. 
" Mr. JACQUES REICH, 1 Madison Ave., N. T. 

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham 
Lincoln, when I took it to be framed for the President, and it is the best 
likeness of him. ... I am the only living body guard of Abraham 
Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to me today, as when he was living. I would love so much to 
have one of those etchings if you will kindly tell me how I can get one. 
Very truly yours, WM. H. CROOK."

£ The Chicago Tribune on Stevenson's "New Arabian Nights " 

" It would be hard to conceive of more repulsive reading, . . . We have no words with which to ade- 
quately express our condemnation of a book which is a travesty on the dignity of literary work." 

The London Pall Mall Gazette said: 

" The soul of him who enjoys it can only be filled with tender pity for the soul of him who does not." 

k ■ 

m The Chicago Tribune on 

fc De Morgan's "It Never Can Happen Again" 

k "A distinct literary disappointment. Characters a lot of shilly-shallying folk, weak and contemptible, 

do not interest. . . . The charm seems broken." 

Is It a Disappointment? 

" William De Morgan at his very best." — The Independent. 

" Maintains the high reputation of the author. ... As good as its predecessors, ' Joseph Vance,' « Alice- 
for-short ' and « Somehow Good.' " — Chicago Record-Herald. 

" Mr. De Morgan again welcome. Regarding ' It Never Can Happen Again,' we hope it will happen 
often."— New York Sun. 

Are the Characters Weak and Contemptible? 

" Lizerann is the most enchanting of children. . . . Lizerann and Jim Coupland . . . remain, for the 
most part, an infinitely lovable and pathetic pair. . . . The warm personal affection wrung from us by the 
chief characters in the other novels remains untouched by this minutely exhibited trio [Challis, Judith, and 
Marianne] — though it goes forth readily enough to several of the other characters : Lizerann, Jim, the 
Reverend Athelstan Taylor, and his Adeline." — H. W. Boynton in The Nation. 

" When the author has an affection for a character ... he gives it to us with a thousand happy observa- 
tions and indulgent reflections. ... It is not merely that he sees results, but that he sees motives." — Chicago 
Evening Post. 

" Splendid vitality of the characters. Every one is natural, consistent, delightfully human and real. . . . 
Masterly in characterization." — Chicago Record-Herald. 

" Another long, delightful voyage with the best English company. . . . The story of a child certainly not

" Ingenious invention stamped with the truly creative mark, replete with humor, and rich with the fruits

" What else has the story ? Not twenty reviews would be enough to tell. To say • humor,' < pathos,' 
' distinction ' is idle. Everything Mr. De Morgan writes comes like a wise and friendly and astonishingly 
intimate comment on one's own life." — Chicago Evening Post. 

" To read this is like chewing out the savor of an old Saxon chronicle after a big dose of imitation 
Frenchmen." — New York Evening Sun. 

" The talk of the blind man and the child is the stuff that tears in hardened and careless hearts are 
made of . . . . The book throws on a large canvas many aspects of modern life as seen and interpreted by a 
man singularly perceiving, mellow, wise, charitable, humorous — a romanticist even in his realism, a master 
of style. A story with a plot as well defined as a French farce." — New York Times Review.

Boston Transcript, Dec. 4-' "A far more complicated and ambitious tale than most of those dealing with 
stage life. ... It deals with vital things in a very vital fashion. . . . Interesting and worth reading." In

Relations of the United States 
and Spain — Diplomacy 

By Rear-Admiral F. E. CHAD WICK 
$4.00 net; postpaid, $4.40 

The vividly told and deeply interesting story of a " century of diplomatic 
ill-feeling," in which the trouble over Florida, Napoleon's erratic behavior in the 
Louisiana affair, the struggle of the South American republics with Spain, the 
Carlist wars, and many of the most important historical personages on both sides 
of the water, played an important part. The absorbing way in which the pro- 
fonnd knowledge and research in the book is presented makes this the most 
interesting, as it is the most valuable, study of the approach of the greatest 
events in the last forty years of our history. 

" The only complete record in a single volume of the long and devious nego- 
tiations between this country and Spain in more than one hundred years. It is 
well to have history written in a spirit of candor and with the intention of secur- 
ing the truth." — Philadelphia Inquirer.

IMPORTANT BOOKS 



THE TREATMENT OF NATURE IN ENGLISH POETRY By myra Reynolds 

When Dr. Johnson declared that " A roan tired of London is tired of life," he epitomized the attitude of his age. The effect of 
this narrow artificiality on English poetry is ably described in this book. It is an exhaustive investigation into the works of the 
greater and lesser poets who wrote between the middle of tbe seventeeth and the end of the eighteenth centuries. The beginning 
and slow development of a real nature-sense are acutely traced and brought into relation with other activities of the time. The 
book is illustrated with copies of contemporary paintings which show more clearly than words the extent of the artists' feeling 
for nature. 410 pages, 8vo, cloth ; net |2.50, postpaid $2.70. 

ENGLISH POEMS : The Elizabethan Age and the Puritan Period By WALTER c. bronson 

So favorable has been the reception accorded " The Nineteenth Century " and " The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century " 
that the present volume needs little introduction. It follows the same general plan as its predecessors, with the added advantages 
of an especially fascinating field — the most spontaneous and exuberant period of English poetry. The notes contain elucidation 
of difficult passages and illuminating commentary — the index and bibliography are unusually elaborate and detailed. 550 pages, 
12mo, cloth ; library edition, net $1.50, postpaid $1.66 ; school edition, net $1.00, postpaid $1.15. 

BOCCACCIO AND HIS IMITATORS By FLORENCE N. JONES 

A collection of the titles of books founded on Boccaccio. The volume reports exhaustively on the authors who have taken 
much or little from the Decameron and brings together for the first time tangible evidence of the extent of Boccaccio's influence. 
The student who seeks to know how all literature has been affected by the work of this one man is able through this list to trace 
effectively his power. 46 pages, 8vo, paper; net 50 cents, postpaid, 53 cents. 

THE CAMERALISTS: The Pioneers of German Social Polity By albion w. small 

To readers of English only, cameralism is virtually a lost chapter in the history of the social sciences. Although everything 
now belonging to German polity has a part of its heredity in that type of social theory, not every reputable student of the social 
sciences in America could correctly define the term, and few could name more than one or two writers to whom it is properly 
applied. In this volume there is given to readers of English the first reliable and detailed account of the caineralistic school. 
500 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $3.00, postpaid $3.18. 

THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER By james edward Rogers 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been 
made. The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion being treated as one of 
concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of 
getting acquaintance with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book discusses in succession the following topics: 
The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper; The City and the Newspaper ; The Nature of the American Newspaper ; The 
Influence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid $1.10.

for clear thinking, mark the book as an exceptional interpretation of our national life.

The Religions of the Far East By Horace G. Underwood

with the Introduction and the Study of Comparative Religion, issued last year by Frank B.

Cloth. Ready in January. 

The Development of Religion By Irving King 

An interesting departure from the old methods of attempting to determine the essential 
qualities of the religious consciousness by an analysis of religion in and of itself. It is rather

this or that religious practice. Cloth. Ready probably in February.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 60 



We were recently assured by the New York 
" Nation " that philologists are by no means the 
dull dogs that they are popularly supposed to be, 
and the assurance was fortified by modern in- 
stances in convincing exposition. The psycholo- 
gists also, under the leadership of Professor James 
and Professor Miinsterberg, are growing posi- 
tively genial ; and the sociologists, if we may in- 
clude among them such writers as Mr . H. G. Wells 
and Mr. G. Bernard Shaw, are becoming fairly 
coruscating in their brilliancy. Even the dismal 
science now and then reckons among its adepts 
a scholar whose irrepressible vitality relieves it 
from the old-time reproach, and shows it to be 
really human in its implications. Just now it 
is the turn of history, — if we may indulge in 
the method of generalization from a single ex- 
ample, and base our proposition upon the ad- 
dress of President Hart before the American 
Historical Association at its meeting held during 
holiday week. The subject of Professor Hart's 
address was " Imagination in History," and it 
makes the liveliest sort of reading. The dry- 
asdusts may have worked their will upon other 
sessions of the meeting, but this one was given 
over to wisdom tempered with wit, and to his- 
torical scholarship garbed in the grace of literary 
expression. 

Mr. Hart pays his respects to many kinds of 
imaginative historians — the plain liars, the 
myth-makers, the hero- worshippers, the senti- 
mentalists, the writers of metaphyical leanings, 
the literary artists who are constitutionally 
incapable of accuracy, the historians who are 
determined to be picturesque and dramatic at 
all costs. Of deliberate historical fabrications 
he gives some of the familiar examples, and 
some very curious ones not nearly so well known. 
There was George Psalmanazar, u whose very 
name is a guarantee of candid bad faith," and 
whose Formosa " was plainly one of the most 
distant spots visited by Sindbad the Sailor." 
There was Sigonio, who forged a work of Cicero, 
and had his publisher obtain "from the great 
scholar Sigonio an opinion that none but Cicero 
could have written the book." There was Lucas, 
an ingenious Frenchman, whose specialty was 
autograph letters, and who imposed upon a

The myth-makers have been busy in the field 
of American history, comparatively young as 
that history is. The story of Marcus Whitman 
and how he saved Oregon has recently been 
"resolved into its elementary gases " by an ex- 
pert analyst. Other myths, such as those of the 
Pilgrim Fathers and the Virginia Cavaliers, are 
of such molluscous structure that it is difficult 
to strike them at a vital point, and they still 
persist in a sort of semi-animate existence. Dr. 
Hart remarks truly, concerning one of them : 

" My ancester, Stephen Hart, helped to settle Cam- 
bridge, and later was one of the fundamental orderers 
of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut; but in the 
Pequot War he massacred Indian women and children 
mercilessly. I take no responsibility for his acts ; I refer 
the case to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs." 

The hero-myth, as exemplified by the portrait 
of Washington drawn by the inventive and sen- 
timental Weems, is neatly characterized. 

" Weems has never been properly understood by the 
American public; he landed himself among the im- 
mortals by writing what is substantially a romance — a 
kind of patriotic ' Sanford and Merton ' — not intended 
to give information about George Washington but to 
suggest virtuous conduct to young Americans. Who 
but an expert performer upon the imagination could 
personify Washington's father on the boy's refusal to 
divide a fine large apple with his brothers and sisters ? 
' George looked in silence on the wide wilderness of 
fruit. He marked the busy humming bees, and heard 
the gay notes of birds; then lifting his eyes filled with 
shining moisture to his father, he softly said, " Well, 
Pa, only forgive me this time ; and see if I ever be so 
stingy any more." ' Human nature rebels at this attempt 
to make a prig out of a youth who was probably more 
likely to steal apples than to divide them." 

Such examples of misdirected imagination in 
historical writing almost force one into the sci- 
entific camp, where facts alone are supposed to 
count. But husks are the provender there 
offered the hungry student, and he is not alto- 
gether to be blamed for hankering after the 
flesh-pots of invention. The president of the 
American Historical Association is under bonds 
to respect facts, and honor the men who give 
their lives to ascertaining them ; but he demands 
something more of the historian than the scra- 
ping together of facts, and realizes the justice of 
such criticism as he quotes from Dr. Crothers : 



" The historical expert starts with the Magna Charta 
and makes a preliminary survey. Then he begins his 
march down the centuries, intrenching every position 
lest he be caught unawares by the critics. His intel- 
lectual forces lack mobility, as they must wait for their 
baggage trains. . . . There are references to bulky vol- 
umes, where at the foot of every page the notes run 
along, like little angry dogs barking at the text." 

So our writer has a good word even for Froude, 
and a more than good word for Macaulay, for 
neither the unreliability of the one nor the pre- 
judice of the other can altogether nullify the 
splendid picturesqueness and dramatic qualities 
of both. Those men, and Tacitus and Gibbon 
and Parkman, are all quoted from to illustrate 
imagination of the kind that must excite the ad- 
miration of the most captious historian ; and by 
way of contrast, a single sentence, running to 
over three hundred words, from Bishop Stubbs, 
is cited as an example of historical writing that 
" would not arouse a poet to an ode nor a nation 
to revolution." This is perhaps as far as the 
speaker dared to go when addressing an audience 
" composed wholly of cautious persons who never 
open their mouths without a foot-note to a trusty 
original." 

On the whole, Professor Hart's plea is for 
imagination, properly regulated of course, in 
the writing of history. " There is much in his- 
tory that cannot be measured like atomic 
weights, or averaged like insurance losses," is 
his epigrammatic way of saying it. All histori- 
cal writing that is worth anything recognizes 
"this impotence of facts taken by themselves, 
this infusion of a shadowy something which may 
be called sentiment, or the ideal, or spirit, or 
imagination." History is "an art which stands 
alongside that of the painter, the sculptor, and 
the architect, which puts the great historian 
parallel with the philosopher, the seer, and the 
poet." And the final summary of the argument 
is thus finely expressed : 

" The danger of the historian is in imagination, that 
is, in the kind of imagination which invents details or 
seizes upon the unimportant ones, or combines them 
into pictures which are but the outside; which tell us 
nothing of the stir and movement of human souls, the 
clash of human wills, of the thinking of national 
thoughts. There is another kind of imagination which 
works from within outword ; which makes the reader 
see, as the historian sees, the real characters of men ; 
which divines their motives ; which, allowing for human 
weaknesses and for the pressure of adverse circum- 
stances, informs us whether this or that man, this or 
that peoplo, this or that age, this or that standard has 
carried forward civilization, opened wide the gates for 
thought, liberated souls. There is no great history 
without large imagination, any more than there is painti 
ing, or for that matter, scientific discovery."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Gladstone the man of letters received but a 
small part of the tribute that was paid to the great 
statesman on the occasion of his centenary (Decem- 
ber 29). The omission may justify a passing word 
in recognition of Gladstone the writer and lover of 
literature. His very first book, "The State in its 
Relations with the Church," which appeared in 1838 
as a plea for the union of church and state, had the 
distinction of a review from Macaulay's pen. " The 
book," said Macaulay, "though not a good book, 
shows more talent than many good books. It contains 
some eloquent and ingenious passages. It bears the 
signs of much patient thought." Talent rather than 
genius was, indeed, a characteristic of all Gladstone's 
writings. — a wonderful facility in the handling of 
material and in the use of words. It was the same 
quality that appeared, intensified by the arts of the 
orator, in his speeches. A Quarterly Reviewer, 
commenting on Gladstone's four-hour speech on the 
budget of 1860, used the phrase, "The enchanted 
region of pure Gladstonism, — that terrible com- 
bination of relentless logic and dauntless imagina- 
tion." One cannot read Gladstone's printed words 
without feeling the vigor and earnestness of his 
thought. His " Juventus Mundi," written in the 
intervals between engrossing public duties, is a re- 
remarkable piece of scholarly research touched with 
enthusiasm — whatever its defects as a contribution 
to the right understanding of Homer. Its opinions 
are stated with emphasis and clearness. Homer's 
treatment of the gods and goddesses of Greece is, as 
a representation of " the Olympian religion," " one 
of the topmost achievements of the human mind." 
His appreciation of animal grace is described in 
glowing terms : " Homer had a profound perception 
of the beauty of animals, at least in the case of the 
horse, as to color, form, and especially movement." 
It was Gladstone's tremendous earnestness, the con- 
centration of all his energies on the matter in hand, 
that enabled him to accomplish so much, both in 
literature and in affairs of state. 

The multiplication of learned societies, as 
called to one's attention by their holiday conventions 
in New York, Boston, and elsewhere, offers encour- 
aging proof that our national energies are not all 
directed toward materialistic ends. The large and 
enthusiastic gathering of scholars in the halls of 
Columbia University, and in other public buildings 
of the city, was made up of members of no fewer 
than nine learned societies, — the American His- 
torical Association, the American Economic Asso- 
ciation, the American Political Science Association, 
the American Statistical Association, the American 
Sociological Society, the American Association for 
Labor Legislation, the American Social Science 
Association, the Bibliographical Society of America, 
and the American Society of Church History. 
Simultaneously with the New York meetings there 



was a mustering in Boston of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, and its nu- 
merous subsidiary and allied societies, under the 
presidency of Dr. David Starr Jordan. In the halls 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of the 
Harvard Medical School and elsewhere in Boston 
and in Cambridge, were held meetings of physiolo- 
gists, anatomists, bacteriologists, chemists, mathe- 
maticians, entomologists, astronomers, seed-analysts, 
geologists, and representatives of many other -ologies, 
— all presumably interested in making Science really 
and beneficially the concern, not of the school or the 
study or the laboratory merely, but of society at 
large. Whatever the comparative cultural value of 
science and humanism (those jealous educational 
rivals of long standing), that late 'lamented French 
humanist, Ferdinand Brunetiere, went entirely too 
far in asserting that science is bankrupt and has no 
new things in store for mankind. 

Notable gatherings of American scholars 
occurred at Baltimore in the Christmas vacation 
week, when the Archaeological Institute of America 
and the American Philological Association met in 
annual convention under the hospitable roof of the 
Johns Hopkins University. Despite the polysyllabic 
names and learned character of these bodies, one 
presidential address at least was in lighter vein and 
provocative of much mirth. Professor Gildersleeve, 
president of the Philological Association, succeeded 
in so presenting the " Aspects of Philological Work 
in America " as to enliven and entertain his large 
audience. His fifty years' study of languages, and 
his almost fifty years' connection with the society he 
was addressing, qualified him to speak in a richly 
reminiscent and instructive strain. Yet he earnestly 
deprecated being called the Nestor of the Associa- 
tion. " The grievance of grievances," he continued, 
'• is that. Nestor has left a name to be fastened on 
every man who has had the opportunity of making 
himself foolish in the sight of the third generation." 
The titles of a few of the papers read will show the 
nature of the discussions for which so many eminent 
scholars had assembled from all points of the com- 
pass. There was an essay on " The Origin of the 
Idea of the Atom According to Heracleides and 
Asclepiades," one on " Certain Linguistic Tests of 
the Relative Antiquity of the Iliad and the Odyssey," 
another on " The Treatment of Time in the jEneid," 
and still another on " Certain Popular Elements in 
the Satires of Persius." A worthy successor to Pro- 
fessor Gildersleeve as President of the Association 
was chosen in Dr. Paul Shorey of the University of 
Chicago. 

The rooster as> a hero of the stage is the 
novel feature of M. Rostand's new play, "Chanti- 
cleer" (as we will call it in English), about which 
there has been a vast amount of talk and conjecture 
and curious inquiry, ever since it was reported, 
eight years ago, that the author of " Cyrano " and 
" L'Aiglon " had conceived a novel and startling

idea for dramatic treatment. Why Paris has had 
to wait all this weary while to hear the marvellous 
" cock " crow appears to have been due to illness, to 
a death in the poet's family, and, later, to the 
lamented demise of the actor Coquelin. In regard 
to the genesis of the new play, its author is reported 
to have expressed himself at some length in a recent 
interesting interview. That he had taken a hint 
from Aristophanes or any other writer, he would not 
admit. " It may be possible," he acknowledged, 
" that others have had the same idea as mine. They 
tell me that in the Middle Ages certain parts of 
' Le Roman du Renard ' were arranged for the stage 
and acted ; but I have not verified the statement, 
and no one can show me the text." Pressed with 
questions as to whence came his first suggestion for 
the play, the poet replied : " Where did the idea 
come from ? By chance, while idling in the coun- 
try. Soon after I had produced ' L'Aiglon ' I was 
ill, and to convalesce I established myself at Cambo. 
Near the house I then occupied there was a farm. 
One day, while walking about, I entered the farm- 
yard. I can still see this farmyard, full of light 
and thronged with happy animals. There were all 
sorts of them. . . . There was a magpie. There 
was a cage on the wall full of birds. All these 
creatures seemed to be thinking and talking together 
of a thousand things. Suddenly the cock came in, 
and there was a general commotion. It seemed as 
if his entrance had been made the topic of a new 
conversation ; they really talked about this rooster. 
... Then these animals, I know not why, seemed 
to me the characters in a sentimental, ideal play, of 
which the background was this barnyard. I saw the 
play before beginning it, and I called it ' A Little 
Corner of the World.' For a long time it lived in 
my mind under this title. Then a novel, a very 
good novel, was published with the same title. 
Thereupon I named my play after the principal 
character, • Chanticleer,' so called in ' Le Roman du 
Renard ' to distinguish the cock. At the same time 
that I found the title I found the actor for the part, 
Coquelin." 

A NOTEWORTHY EXHIBITION OF MANUSCRIPTS 

and rare books, loaned by different persons, was 
held at the Columbia University Library in connec- 
tion with the recent annual convention of various 
learned societies, including the Bibliographical So- 
ciety of America. Especially interesting to members 
of the American Historical Society were various 
autograph manuscripts of famous historians, mediae- 
val chronicles in manuscript, and early editions of 
ancient historians. There was also on exhibition the 
famous Columbus letter announcing the discovery of 
America in 1492, the first dated edition of Americus 
Vespucius (1504), Corlear's Journal of 1634 des- 
cribing the Mohawk Indians, the manuscript rolls of 
the Concord Minute Men, and other documents of 
the colonial and revolutionary periods. English his- 
tory was well represented by the manuscripts of 
Macaulay's and Hume's Histories, and Gibbon's 



notes to his great work, by the original proclamation 
of the Commonwealth (dated May 19, 1649), and 
by printed books of rarity and interest. From Mr. 
J. Pierpont Morgan's splendid collection came, among 
other treasures, the famous "Golden Gospels" once 
owned by King Henry VIIL, written in gold on 
purple vellum, and for a time in the keeping of the 
Vatican. It was presented by Leo X. to Henry 
when the latter received the title " Fidei Defensor." 
It is supposed to be about twelve hundred years old. 
This remarkable exhibition, after attracting the his- 
torians and bibliophiles and other savants assembled 
in convention, continued open for two weeks for the 
benefit of the general public. 

The hand of little employment hath the 
daintier sense, said Hamlet on a certain occasion ; 
but he might have added that through too little 
employment the hand doth lose what sense it had. 
In a recent address before the Liverpool Philomathic 
Society, Sir Frederick Treves, the eminent surgeon 
to the King, lamented the decline of manual dexterity 
and nice skill, with the increasing use of machinery 
in the arts and manufactures. The loom, the sewing 
machine, and the typewriter, he declared, have re- 
duced to a soulless level of uniformity what formerly 
were the diversely excellent products of a million 
hands ; the stamping machine displaces the wood- 
carver and the decorator; and the human hand is 
in some danger of forgetting its cunning. The 
book-lover deplores the passing of hand-made paper 
and hand-bound books. In a letter from Edward 
Everett Hale to Colonel Higginson, quoted in the 
latter's recent book entitled " Carlyle's Laugh, and 
Other Surprises," the letter-writer says : " I see that 
you can write intelligibly. I wish I could — But 
I cannot run a Typewriter more than a Sewing- 
Machine. Will the next generation learn to write — 
any more than learn the alphabet? " Personal letters 
from both these men now lie before us and give 
point to the above passage, although Dr. Hale's pen- 
manship was not (fifteen years ago, the date of our 
letter ) nearly so cryptic as many that we have seen, 
or indeed as he himself seemed to imagine. Another 
letter of Dr. Hale's, dictated and typewritten, also 
lies before us, and perhaps helps to explain the com- 
parative illegibility of the one executed by the little- 
used pen. After all, if the time has passed (or soon 
will have passed) when the Japanese worker in ivory 
could spend half a lifetime in carving a series of con- 
centric hollow spheres, his energies are set free for 
what may well prove to be higher and worthier 
activities. 

Some curious phases of biblioklepsis (the 
Greek word sounds less harsh than "book-stealing") 
attract now and then the notice of those interested 
in such things. The dexterity with which an invet- 
erate book-thief will gain his end would, if turned 
into legitimate channels, win him fame and fortune 
in a short time. The man who succeeded in abstract-

room of the Boston Public Library presented a clear 
case of perverted genius. There has been recently 
recalled, by a chronicler of the vandalism com- 
mitted in that library, the instance of a professional 
biblioklept who managed to make off with a copy of 
the rare first edition of Hawthorne's u Fanshawe," 
and, after removing the book-plate, to sell it to some 
obscure and conscienceless or uninformed dealer, 
from whose hands it finally reached a New York 
auction house, and was returned thence to the lib- 
rary. Such treasures are too rare and too easily 
identified to be of much commercial value to thieves. 
A curious sequel to this incident was the search that 
it led to, on the part of those who read or heard 
about it. for stray copies of the valuable little book 
that might be lurking in ancestral attics or cupboards ; 
and, as a result of all this rummaging, several copies 
were actually unearthed and put on the market, so 
that the price speedily fell from eight hundred to 
four hundred dollars. Often enough it has been 
noted that the bibliokleptic desire seizes upon persons 
otherwise honest and respectable ; a survival, pos- 
sibly, of primitive predatory instincts. 

The book of the year in London cannot be 
named with ease and certainty by any reviewer of 
the extensive literary output of the last twelve 
months in England. But probably more general 
attention has been drawn to Sir Ernest Shackleton's 
work, 4i The Heart of the Antarctic," than to any 
other book of acknowledged worth and importance. 
Its extra-literary or practical interest of course 
greatly overshadows its purely literary merit, al- 
though it is written in a style admirable for its 
strength and effectiveness, and deserves to live as a 
narrative of vivid and fascinating quality. Curiously 
enough, the book of the coming year in the English- 
speaking world, if not in the world at large, prom- 
ises to be another autobiographical account of polar 
exploration, — namely, Captain Peary's story of his 
dash to the North Pole and his safe return, which 
will next month begin its serial appearance. The 
public appetite has been whetted by a most extra- 
ordinary series of events for this true account of a 
genuine exploration, and it will be cause for surprise 
rf the book does not attain an enormous circulation. 

The censorship of books for Sunday-school 
LrBRARiEs, as carried on by a volunteer body known 
as the Church Library Association, organized at 
Cambridge, Mass.. thirty years ago, appears to be 
most thorough. We read in regard to the monthly 
routine duties of this body, that its forty members, 
earnest men and women of the Episcopal Church, 
are divided into a certain number of reading com- 
mittees, and that every book examined by its appro- 
priate committee is reported upon in writing by each 
member of that committee. If a majority of these 
written opinions are favorable, the book is brought 
before the monthly meeting of the association, the 
opinions are read aloud, discussion follows, and a 
vote is taken on the eligibility of the book. A nega- 



tive vote from a fourth of those present casts the 
book into extra-ecclesiastical darkness. All this 
work is of course primarily for the benefit of Sunday- 
school and parish libraries of the church which the 
association represents ; but the published catalogues 
(of which four have now appeared) are obtainable 
by anyone on request from the Secretary of the 
Church Library Association, Cambridge, Mass. No 
books are sold and no orders are taken by the society 
for books, but all its expenses are said to be met by 
voluntary contributions of twenty-five cents each 
from those receiving the catalogues. If such a thing 
as sterilized literature is possible, the books sanc- 
tioned by this reading committee may surely be 
recommended with a tolerable sense of security. 

The original of "The Chambered Nautilus," 
or the first suggestion of it, was once pointed out by 
the poet Stedman in a letter to his friend and dis- 
tant kinsman, Colonel Higginson. The latter pub- 
lishes the letter in his latest volume of miscellanies. 
It is interesting to learn, and it is doubtless new to 
some, that the poetrphysician, Holmes, found his 
" Nautilus " ( in crude enough form, to be sure) in the 
works of another poet-physician, Dr. Samuel Latham 
Mitchell. Turning up his name in Duyckinck's 
" Cyclopaedia of American Literature," we encounter 
an •• Elegy on a Shell — The Nautilus," irregular in 
metre and far less admirable in form and substance 
than the poem to which it appears to have given 
birth. The curious will like to read the older verses 
in full ; but the less eager may be satisfied with these 
three sample stanzas, which in thought and expres- 
sion are the best of the set. 

" Thou wast a house with many chambers fraught, 
Built by a Nautilus or Argonaut, 
With fitness, symmetry, and skill. 
To suit the owner's taste and sovereign will. 

" In curves of elegance thy shape appears, 
Surpassing art through centuries of years, 
By tints and colors brilliant made, 
And all, — the finished workman has displayed. 

" So man erects in sumptuous mode 
A structure proud for his abode, 
But knows not, when of life bereft, 
Who ? 11 creep within the shell he left." 

An English annotator of Dr. Holmes has 
been contributing to the gaiety of the American 
nation. An edition of "The Autocrat of the Break- 
fast Table " which is furnished with a critical analy- 
sis of the author's genius by Mr. Chesterton, and a 
text commentary by Mr. Blakeney of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, has this note on a passage in " The 
Wonderful One-Hoss Shay": u ' Hahnsum kerridge': 
surely an anachronism. The patent for ' Hansom 
Cabs ' was not taken out till 1834. or twenty-four 
years after the date 1810, given here." Then, to 
leave undone no duty of the complete commentator, 
the same conscientious pen adds this footnote : 
" So named from the inventor, Hansom, architect of 
Birmingham town-hall." Other gems are to be 
found in the volume, and the only regret is that the 
Autocrat is no longer with us to enjoy their brilliance.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



SCHOOL BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT. 
fTo the Editor of The Dial.) 

The problem of school administration is filled with 
many practical difficulties, and has never been quite 
comprehensively solved. True, it is always easy enough 
to say what ought to be; but it is not quite so easy to 
determine just how to secure the exact thing desired. 

There exists, for instance, among some school boards, 
the view that the superintendent, as the expert head of 
the school system, should have pretty full swing in the 
conduct of the purely pedagogical side of school work. 
These school boards hold that the superintendent should 
have both the initiative and the final word in these 
matters; that any attempt at official interference is un- 
warranted, and likely to be disastrous to the best inter- 
ests of the school. 

Another view existing in some quarters is that the 
school board is, and of necessity must be, the final 
authority upon all matters, both of a professional and a 
business nature; that the initiative may and should be 
accorded to the superintendent in strictly professional 
matters, but beyond this is dangerous ground; that no 
well-equipped school board will permit the superin- 
tendent to extend his official acts beyond the field of 
the initiative. 

The superintendents themselves are not wholly agreed 
as to the exact scope and extent of their duties and 
authority. But the consensus of opinion seems to be in 
favor of their complete and absolute control of purely 
professional work, the school board exercising only a 
perfunctory relation to such matters. 

The writer has been a somewhat interested student 
of the problem for a score or more of years, during 
which, both as a teacher and a member of several school 
boards, as well as a parent and patron of the schools, he 
has tried to consider the subject from every point of 
view. And he is frank to say that from the view-point 
of the public interest — which, as he views it, is always 
of paramount consideration, his conviction is firm that 
the school board should have the final word upon every 
important educational question and matter of policy. 

It seems right and necessary that this should be so. 
The superintendent is at most but the servant of the 
board. He is not its superior; he is employed to do its 
will. It is true that he is, or ought to be, an intelli- 
gent, conscientious, and wise servant; and he can, and 
does, do much to further the interests which he is em- 
ployed to conserve. His advice and services upon pro- 
fessional subjects are admittedly invaluable. But while 
all this is true, it is the school board that is and must 
be responsible to the people. The school board is the 
trustee of the educational interests, — not the superin- 
tendent, and not any other employee of the board. 

There is always danger in giving great and exclusive 
authority to an individual. The superintendents of 
schools are not less human and not a whit wiser than 
their fellows in other walks of life and other fields of 
endeavor. As a school board is answerable to the people 
that put it in power, so should a superintendent be 
subject to the power that gave him his position and 
authority. There is safety in numbers ; and a school 
board, if wisely and judiciously selected, may be trusted 
with the final word. To say that such selections are 
not always made wisely and judiciously does not mili- 
tate against the main contention. A school board of 



three, or five, or seven, or more members, will care- 
fully weigh important school questions before pronounc- 
ing the final verdict. 

The danger from favoritism, from chicane, from trick 
or fraud, is never inconsiderable. School systems have 
been known to suffer severely on these accounts. Here 
is where the right to review the actions and to keep a 
check on the recommendations of superintendents be- 
comes vitally important. This is a field which offers 
opportunity for independent investigation. It is a field 
which, if properly worked, means much to the defence- 
less teacher in every school system. 

The writer has known of superintendents who wel- 
comed the right of review, of independent investigation 
and inquiry; but their number is not large. Most of 
them smart under any attempt at the exercise of authority 
over their professional acts. They assert that it is an 
unwarranted exercise of authority, an exercise of the 
right of review and of criticism which belittles them in 
the public eye and does harm to the system. 

The writer has never become convinced of the correct- 
ness of this professional point of view. On the contrary, 
he believes that the best interests of the schools demand 
that the right to the final word be always reserved to 
the board itself, which, after all, is only the voice of the 
people whom the board represents and serves. To say 
that the voice of the people is not always wisely ex- 
pressed is to say, in another way, that all human effort 
is imperfect. Duane Mowry.

"I SWAN!" 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

My eye has just caught the following passage in Thk 
Dial of October 16, p. 273: 

"A writer in the London 'Nation' comments on our sup- 
posed use of 'I swan.' 'I frequently ask my American 
friends,' says this writer, ' if they can give me the derivation 
of " I swan," and never yet have I heard even an attempt to 
do so. Fifty years ago " I swan " was in regular use by poets 
and novelists, and to-day it is employed in current American 
speech, though a certain class of Americans seem to find it 
necessary to apologize for the use of what they think is slang. ' 
Then we are confidently assured that it is not slang, but 
merely a corruption of ' I warrant you,' through ' I'se 
warrant,' ' A's warn,' of the Liddesdale farmer. Thus what 
has been considered a bit of Yankee slang turns out to be an 
idiom of the Scottish border that ' fifty years ago . . . was in 
regular use by poets and novelists.' Henceforth, our polite 
circles of Boston, or Chicago, or Kalamazoo, or any other 
centre of refinement and culture, may feel at liberty to con- 
tinue the daily use of ' I swan,' but with no longer any need 
of the hitherto customary apology. What a relief ! " 

We all know that many words and phrases, popularly 
supposed to be Americanisms, were brought over by the 
early settlers from England, where they have become 
obsolete. So often has an alleged Americanism been 
proved to be a survival of an English provincialism, 
that there are times when we Americans may well ask 
ourselves, " Is our reputed faculty for coining words 
after all a delusion ? " Our British cousins are too apt 
to insist that it is. The easy way in which your re- 
viewer accepted the gold brick handed out by the writer 
in the London " Nation " confirms this. It may be 
necessary to haul down the Stars and Stripes, but let 
us not do so without at least striking a blow. Permit 
me to offer the following comments on the above 
passage. 

(1) The writer in the London " Nation " has never

" heard even an attempt " to explain " I swan." An 
attempt, doubtless a successful one, was made twenty 
years ago in the Century Dictionary, where we read : 
" A euphemistic variation of swear • cf. svcow, a similar 
evasion." 

( 2 ) The notion that " I warrant you " is " an idiom 
of the Scottish border" which originated a beggarly 
half-century ago is diverting, seeing that it has been in 
vogue among English poets and authors for at least 
three centuries. 

(3) The writer's further notion that " I warrant yon " 
and " I swan " are identical in meaning is also amusing, 
for " I swan " is an expletive. Moreover, though no 
fewer than twenty-eight forms of " I warrant you " are 
recorded in the English Dialect Dictionary, " I swan " 
is not one of them. 

(4) "I swan" is declared by lexicographers, even 
English ones, to be an Americanism. This of course is 
not conclusive, for even lexicographers are not infallible; 
but as the examples they quote are all American and 
run back to 1842, clearly the burden of proof lies on him 
who asserts that it is not an Americanism. 

(5 ) In their " Slang and its Analogues," Farmer and 
Henley quote an example from Mrs. Kirkland's " Forest 
Life," published in 1842 — or before the idiom is said 
to have originated along the Scottish border. But that 
is a much-belated example, for in a letter written from 
Boston and printed in the " New fork Packet " of 
November 22, 1784, we read: 

' ' When I left this town last April, I was (you will remem- 
ber) very desirous that we should obtain a charter of incor- 
poration. . . . Go, go to New York, gentlemen, go and see 
what pickle that town is in, and then tell me (if you dare) of 
getting Mayors. Aldermen, and the Lord knows what besides! 
Cui bono, my friends ? Nay, I swan (as the old saying is) , we 
of Boston, after all. are the better off than those of New York ; 
have we not got a fine public walk, now well planted, gravelled 
and fenced in ? Whereas, at New York (although they have 
what they call their fields), yet none of them have ever 
thought as yet of planting a single tree for public ornament 
or utility. Ergo, no charter for Boston ; and I will vote 
against every attempt to bring in this new mode of govern- 
ment.'* 

Note the words " as the old saying is," showing that one 
hundred and twenty-six years ago the idiom was well 
established. 

(6) Finally, the expression carries on its face proof 
that it is an Americanism. Your Britisher comes out 
with a good honest " damn," but your American, ever 
fond of soft swearing, dilutes it to " darn." Hence, 
" I swan " is eminently characteristic.

SECTIONALISM IN LEARNED SOCIETIES. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
It ought not to be necessary to point out to the writer 
of the communication on "A Localized American 
Academy," in your last issue, that such institutions as 
the American Academy of Arts and Letters cannot be 
established on a geographical basis. It is not a question 
of where a man lives, but what he has done. Naturally, 
it is the tendency of men eminent in art or literature 
to gravitate to the great cities of the country, and par- 
ticularly to the older centres of culture. Artists, in- 
deed, as in the cases of Sargent and Abbey, are quite 
as likely to make their homes abroad. But they are 
none the less American by birth and inheritance. The 
Academie Franeaise is made up almost wholly of men 



who live in Paris, yet no one would think of denying 
its claim to represent fairly the literary ideals and per- 
formance of the French nation. 

I suppose your correspondent credits Mark Twain to 
New York, because his home is not far from that city. 
But no man could be less of a " New Yorker," or repre- 
sent more perfectly the great region of the central 
Mississippi Valley. The various cities and states of the 
country, the great universities of the West and the 
Pacific Slope, cannot legitimately be represented as such 
in an American Academy. Of course if your corre- 
spondent believes particular members of the Academy 
unworthy of the distinction, in comparison with other 
men who have not been so honored, that is another 
matter. He would not in that case be without sympa- 
thizers. But the Academy is not less American because 
most of its members happen at present to live near the 
Atlantic seaboard. Henry S. Chapman. 

Boston, January 5, 1910. 

[It seems but just to our previous correspondent 
to recall that he himself said that w for such an in- 
stitution the best men should be chosen, wherever 
found," and that his whole point seemed to be that 
geographical considerations had counted too much, 
not too little, in the formation of the Academy. —

A LONDON LITERARY HAUNT. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I have been reading your paper with much interest, 
as I always do, and I notice in a recent issue a review 
of " The Literary History of the Adelphi and its Neigh- 
bourhood," by Mr. Brereton. May I observe that I am 
the publisher of this work, and my friends Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. issue it for me in America ; of course the 
book is of London origin. 

Like my friend the author, I am also a resident in the 
Adelphi. You ask what part of the neighbourhood de- 
scribed in this book is known as the Adelphi. I think 
it is that part which forms a square with its front to the 
Thames known as Adelphi Terrace, its west side Robert 
Street (named after Robert Adam), its east side Adam 
Street, and its north side John Street (after John 
Adam), in which will be found the well-known Adams 
House occupied by the Society of Arts. This square 
block was practically all built by the Brothers Adam, 
architects; and, as you will note, is named after the 
family. Your notice fairly describes the book and its 
literary associations. I am glad to say they continue to 
this day, as we have as neighbors on this Terrace some 
good American citizens, such as Mr. and Mrs. Joseph 
Pennell; there are also J. M. Barrie the dramatist, 
Sidney Low the historical writer and journalist, Bernard 
Shaw, novelist and dramatist, J. B. Atley, another well- 
known man of letters ; and of course my publishing 
business is housed at No. 1 Adelphi Terrace and No. 19 
Adam Street — houses which show the characteristics 
of the art of the brothers for whom the street was 
named. 

I may add that should any of your friends desire to 
visit this interesting neighbourhood, they will find the 
" quartier," as Mrs. Pennell calls it, by taking the first 
turn westward after leaving the Hotel Cecil or the Savoy, 
and it certainly will give me great pleasure to show them 
anything of interest there is to be seen in the Adelphi.

A Southern Woman's Reminiscences.* 

If Mrs. Pryor's volume of " Reminiscences of 
a Long Life " does not sell with the best novels 
of the season, the reason will lie elsewhere than 
in its power to seize and hold the interest of any 
intelligent reader. American autobiography 
and reminiscence has attained many a high level 
during the past decade, but here is a book which 
the reader will unhesitatingly put on his choicest 
shelf with the best of it all. A happy girlhood 
and a happy marriage in the best circles of the 
old Virginia life of the middle of the last cen- 
tury, the fiery test of extreme poverty and humil- 
iation in the wreck of that society incident to 
the Civil War, the removal to New York City 
and the grim struggle there to pick up the 
broken threads of life and weave them once 
more into a comely fabric, with the slow but 
ever advancing march to a position of usefulness 
and influence and honor beyond anything which 
either she or her gifted husband had dared hope 
for, — this is the framework of Mrs. Pryor's story. 

At the outbreak of the war Mr. Pryor was a 
member of the House of Representatives. When 
the fateful news of the secession of South Caro- 
lina reached Washington, the Pryors, President 
Buchanan, and others in high social and official 
station, were attending a wedding. Mrs. Pryor 
herself bent over the back of the President's 
chair and gave him the momentous information, 
just received over the wires by Representative 
Keitt of the seceding state. Falling back in a 
dazed condition, the President grasped both 
arms of his chair, and begged her, in a whisper, 
to have his carriage summoned. She and her 
husband immediately called their own carriage, 
and drove away, " with no more thought of 
bride, bridegroom, wedding-cake or wedding 
breakfast." " This," she continues, " was the 
tremendous event which was to change all our 
lives, — to give us poverty for riches, mutila- 
tion and wounds for strength and health, obscur- 
ity and degradation for honor and distinction, 
exile and loneliness for inherited home and 
friends, pain and death for happiness and life." 

Although Mrs. Pryor's husband threw him- 
self energetically into the cause of his section 
and attained distinction as a brave and effec- 
tive commander in the Confederate army, he

accepted defeat in good faith and used every 
effort in his power to hasten the healing of the 
wounds that had been made. At one time or 
another he had met in battle Generals Hancock, 
Slocum, Butterfield, Sickles, Fitz-John Porter, 
McClellan, and Grant, all of whom became his 
firm friends in later years. " They had fought 
loyally under opposing banners, and from time 
to time, as the war went on, one and another had 
been defeated; but over all and through all, 
their allegiance had been given to a banner that 
has never surrendered — the standard of the 
universal brotherhood of all true men." 

In November, 1864, while she was leading a 
painfully economical life at Petersburg, virtually 
in a state of siege, with a babe less than a year 
old in her arms, came the news that General 
Pryor had been captured and was held as a 
prisoner of war. It was at first ordered that 
he be taken to Fort Warren, in Boston Harbor ; 
but he was finally committed to Fort Lafayette 
instead, where his privilege of a daily walk upon 
the ramparts allowed him to look upon the mist- 
blurred outlines of the great city where in later 
years he was destined to an honored position 
upon the Supreme Bench, and his no less worthy 
wife to a place of effective leadership, especially 
in the benevolent and charitable activities of the 
best social life of the metropolis. But in the 
meanwhile, what grief, toil, and humiliation ! 
In the little cottage at Petersburg an old trunk 
full of the finery of a happier day is dragged 
forth. The laces are remorselessly ripped from 
evening gowns, made deftly into the forms then 
in vogue, and sent to Richmond to be sold. 
Silks and muslins and artificial flowers followed 
the laces when it was found that Richmond 
could furnish a market for the tasteful creations 
which her ingenuity could devise under the keen 
spur of want of food for herself and children. 
But there was humor to season even that dish 
of woe. " Aunt Jinny," an old negro woman, 
was vexed in conscience because Mrs. Pryor was 
" sho'ly leadin' de po' young lambs in Richmond 
into vanity " by the powerful halter of such 
finery, when the Almighty has told us that we 
should clothe ourselves rather with the garment 
of righteousness. But Eliza, another negro 
friend in need, cut her short right at that point : 
" You 'pear to me to be mighty intimate with 
God A'mighty. Now you just run 'long home 
an' leave my mistis to 'er work. How would 
you look with nothin' on but a garment of 
righteousness? " 

When Petersburg was occupied by the Union 
forces, Mrs. P^or was held as a prisoner in two

of her rooms for ten days, by General Sheridan, 
who took possession of her house for an adju- 
tant's office. A little later she was compelled 
to apply for rations for her family to Major- 
General Hartsuff ; but the first consignment 
brought to the house was unspeakably beyond 
the point of edibility. She turned to her table 
and wrote, " Is the Commanding General aware 
of the nature of the ration issued this day to the 
destitute women of Petersburg ? " The delivery 
of this note brought in haste an orderly with an 
official slip commanding the Quartermaster and 
Commissary to " furnish Mrs. Roger A. Pryor 
with all she may demand or require, charging 
the same to the private account of George L. 
Hartsuff, Major-General Commanding." But 
he soon learned a little more of the spirit of the 
woman with whom he was dealing. " Mrs. 
Roger A. Pryor," the response went back to 
him, " is not insensible to the generous offer of 
Major-General Hartsuff, but he ought to have 
known that the ration allowed the destitute 
women of Petersburg must be enough for 
Mrs. Roger A. Pryor." Even the tearful ap- 
peal of Mrs. Hartsuff, who came at once on a 
personal visit, failed to move her to accept the 
private favors which in the nature of the case 
others coidd not have ; and the next day saw 
rations of another character. 

We might fill columns with choice extracts 
from this most interesting volume, which de- 
serves the widest reading. It lets the light in 
upon phases of the Civil War and its sequels 
with which too many are unacquainted, and it 
makes for the sympathy and good feeling between 
North and South which alone can give the key 
to problems even yet unsettled.

Dante en English Literature.* 

Thanks to the author of the Dante Diction- 
ary, we now have a full, perhaps exhaustive, 
collection of materials for the history of the in- 
fluence of Dante on the English mind. By En- 
glish, Dr. Toynbee evidently means British, as 
he includes the Scotch but excludes the Ameri- 
cans. Here are some 1400 pages of citations 
containing all the discoverable allusions to, or

comment upon, the Tuscan poet, which were 
made in Great Britain down to the date of the 
death of Cary the translator. Translations are 
also noticed and liberally ci'ed. Biographical 
notices, based upon the " Dictionary of National 
Biography," of all the known authors, are pro- 
vided. The author exhibits again the vigilance, 
industry, and scholarship which he has taught us 
to expect from him. The arrangement of all this 
material is "in the chronological order of the 
first work quoted," the several citations from 
one author being grouped together. It is ill 
looking a gift- horse in the mouth, but the re- 
viewer is constrained to say that this plan results 
in some confusion of different eras. For ex- 
ample, Merivale, commenting in 1843 upon 
Francis Horner's studies in Dante, undertaken 
to beguile his dying days in 1817, is made to 
precede Horner himself by some forty pages, all 
but three lines of those forty pages being de- 
voted to citations of dates between 1814 and 
1822. Again, an anecdote is taken from 
Thomas Moore's Diary illustrating the prefer- 
ence entertained by Moore for Wright's trans- 
lation as compared with Cary's. But before 
coming to Wright himself we have to traverse 
no less than 540 pages, a long gap which Dr. 
Toynbee has neglected to bridge by cross- 
references. This quite mechanical arrangement 
has the merit of bringing all the comment of 
each author together, all the material being 
rendered accessible by means of the Index, the 
numerous notes and cross-references, and the 
Chronological List of Authors — which, how- 
ever, is not chronological, but is arranged in the 
order described above. Dr. Toynbee has en- 
riched the work with an Introduction in which 
he gives a brief outline of the course of Dante 
criticism in England. Here, and in the Index, 
under the heads "Commedia" and "Dante," 
are grouped together some of the more terse 
and distinctive pronouncements, pro and con, 
many of which are illustrations of the English 
genius for denouncing what it cannot under- 
stand. 

A noticeable feature of the work is the hom- 
age done to the Rev. H. F. Cary, by making 
his death the terminus ad quern, an homage jus- 
tified rather by the reputation of Cary than by 
his real merit as a translator. Indeed, Cary 
bulks bigger in these pages than anyone else 
except Dante, whose " English Duplicate and 
Re- incarnation " Coleridge declared him to be. 
No work in the English language, except 
Macpherson's Ossian, has been more persistently 
over-rated. To parody Voltaire's unlucky

prophecy about Dante, it does seem that Cary's 
reputation has gone on increasing because he 
has been so little read. To the Cary legend, 
Dr. Toynbee has contributed an impetus, not 
only here but in an annotated edition of Cary's 
translation. Scholarship, however, not poetic 
taste, is the forte of our author. Why Cole- 
ridge should have so praised Cary in the first 
place, is an interesting question. Certainly, 
Coleridge was a good judge of poetry ; that he 
was not an infallible judge is shown by his 
extreme admiration for the sonnets of Bowles. 
An impulsive critic, he was doubtless overawed 
by Cary's superior knowledge of Dante, whose 
work had hitherto been imperfectly known in 
England, and scantily appreciated. Cary offered 
the first presentable translation ; Coleridge, who 
was getting up Dante about that time, found the 
translation and notes serviceable ; he paid his 
debt to Cary in the most effectual way by 
praising the latter in the famous lecture of 1818; 
having set up as an authority on the subject, he 
could not conveniently withdraw anything he 
might have said, especially after all the world 
had taken up the laud from him as critical cory- 
pheus. All this, I admit, is little better than 
reading between the lines ; but it may have as 
much foundation as some of Coleridge's own 
critical divinations. At all events, one has only 
to analyze the first passage which Coleridge 
quotes from Cary in the notes of his lecture, to 
perceive how uncritical was the praise he lavished 
to the misleading of the nation. The fact is that 
Cary's traducement of the divine Tuscan could 
have found acceptance only among a people 
essentially ignorant of the poet, and at a time 
when interest was just beginning to awaken. 
To be sure, he is a competent writer of blank 
verse, but in a movement which does not sug- 
gest the movement of any great poet except 
sometimes Milton. Does Dante soar easily and 
swiftly, like an eagle ? Cary flutters like a bird 
whose plumage is entangled in the lime-twigs. 
Does Dante say a thing and have done ? Cary 
says it twice. Is Dante simple and severe? 
Cary is turgid and ornate. Does Dante stamp 
the precious metal with his own image and super- 
scription? Cary deals forth the featureless 
fool's gold of poetic commonplace. Dante's 
"broad stream of speech" becomes "copious 
floods of eloquence "; Dante's " poets," a "tune- 
ful train." Dante says to Virgil: "May the 
long study avail me and the great love, which 
have made me search thy volume ! " 

Vagliami il lungo studio e il grande amore 

Che m'ha fatto cercar lo tuo volume. 



Cary: 

May it avail me that I long with zeal 

Have sought thy volume, aud with love immense 

Have conn'd it o'er. 

The trailing repetition is intolerable ; nor is to 
seek a book the same thing as to search it. It 
would take up all the space which utmost edi- 
torial indulgence could allot to this review, to 
point out all the crimes which Cary manages to 
commit in the three stanzas selected by Cole- 
ridge for special praise. He sometimes does 
better, but oftener far worse. 

Chaucer and Milton knew Dante well, and 
show many traces of his influence. Sir Philip 
Sidney must have had some acquaintance with 
him. Shakespeare sometimes says a thing in a 
way that makes one think of Dante, but such 
parallels occur everywhere when great writers 
touch upon the same human or # moral themes. 
Lowell asserted that Spenser had read his 
Dante closely, but Dr. Toynbee is inclined to 
think the resemblances, like those in Shake- 
speare, mere coincidences. Between Milton and 
Coleridge, there are few allusions to Dante in 
the great English writers. If he be mentioned 
at all, it is likely to be with disparagement, or, 
what is worse, with condescension. In his 
" Essay upon the Ancient and Modern Learn- 
ing," Sir William Temple gives his list of " the 
great wits among the moderns "; these were, in 
Italy, Boccaccio, Machiavel, and Padre Paolo ; in 
England, Sir Philip Sidney, Bacon, and Selden. 
What names shine by their absence ! The gen- 
erous shades of Sidney and Boccaccio might 
well be indignant that they also were not omit- 
ted from the enumeration of a critic who could 
forget their betters. Temple's jwotege, Swift, 
does not mention Dante ; nor does Addison, 
who wrote a book about his literary pilgrimage 
through Italy ; nor yet does Burke, who was so 
great a lover of Virgil. Pope and Dr. Johnson 
show no symptoms of familiarity with the 
Tuscan poet, whose name does not occur in the 
famous life of Milton. To Horace Walpole's 
jaunty philosophy, the greatest of modern poets 
is "in short, a Methodist parson in Bedlam "; 
while the Earl of Chesterfield warns his hopeful 
son against wasting his time in the attempt to 
understand an author who is not worth the pains. 
Goldsmith, in his "Enquiry into the present State 
of Polite Learning," pronounces thatDante owed 
most of his reputation to the obscurity of the 
times in which he lived. Akenside, who in his 
curious " Ballance of Poets " applies to the great 
poets what is known in the schools as the 
"marking system," places Dante on the same

form with Ariosto, Horace, Pindar, Pope, Ra- 
cine, Sophocles, without indicating whether he 
should be first or last " tra cotanto senno." In 
taste, Dante is marked 12 (on a scale of twenty), 
with Cervantes and Tasso, no one being lower 
except that ill-bred Shakespeare. In dramatic 
expression, Shakespeare and Homer get the best 
mark (18), while poor Dante goes to the foot 
of the class with a mark of 8. In critical 
ordonnance, Dante gets off with the middling 
mark of 12 : Boileau, Homer, Sophocles, and 
Terence receiving the highest standing, while 
Shakespeare and Ariosto — careless fellows — 
are " flunked " with a zero apiece. As to moral. 
Dante is placed on the same indifferent footing 
with Horace — who appears to have been no 
better than he should be, — but is able to look 
down upon the inferior virtue of his compatriots, 
Tasso and Ariosto, to say nothing of that basest 
of the base, Lucretius, with his zero. 

But amid all the 

■ Rash judgments and the sneers of selfish men " 
recorded in these 1400 pages, perhaps nothing 
is worthier of bad eminence than the remarks 
of Dr. Thomas Warton in his History of En- 
glish Poetry : " We are surprised that a poet 
should write one hundred cantos on hell, para- 
dise, and purgatory. But this prolixity is partly 
owing to the want of art and method, and is 
common to all early compositions in which every- 
thing is related circumstantially and without 
rejection, and not in those general terms which 
are used by modern writers." So carefully is 
all truth here reversed, that the sentence, stand- 
ing alone, might pass for a laborious effort at 
irony. Particularly to be admired is the rare 
excellence of modern poets which consists in the 
use of general terms ! In a later age, indeed, 
Landor, that most treacherous of critics, at- 
tacked Dante, just as he attacked Milton, in the 
guise of a friend. He did what in him lay to 
promote the false and superficial view which 
sees in Dante little to admire but the episodes 
of Francesca and Ugolino, and three or four 
others. 

Nbm ragionam di lor I In that dark age of 
" enlightenment," Gray, in his admiration for 
Dante, as in other things, stood almost alone. 
After Coleridge had spoken, it became the fash- 
ion to prophesy in Dante's name, as did Hazlitt 
without ever knowing him, and Leigh Hunt with 
better right. In those days every critic felt 
bound to come out with a parallel between 
Dante and Milton. To this whole discussion, 
Leigh Hunt contributes what seems to me 
the most penetrating observation : Milton, he 



says, " had not the faith in things that Homer 
and Dante had, apart from the intervention of 
words. He could not let them speak for them- 
selves without helping them with his learning." 
The year 1818 produced two memorable winged 
words about Dante. Coleridge said : " You can- 
not read Dante without feeling a gush of man- 
liness of thought within you." Hallam said : 
•• His appearance made an epoch in the intel- 
lectual history of modern nations. ... It was 
as if, at some of the ancient games, a stranger 
had appeared upon the plain, and thrown his 
quoit among the marks of former casts which 
tradition had ascribed to the demigods." 
Hallam is inclined to prefer " Paradise Lost " 
to the "Divine Comedy"; but Macaulay, who 
knew Milton by heart, thinks Dante the superior 
poet. u He runs neck and neck with Homer, 
and none but Shakespeare has gone decidedly 
beyond him." Again : " His execution I take 
to be far beyond that of any other artist who 
has operated on the imagination by means of 
words." In temperament, Macaulay is a typical 
Englishman, who would have found himself very 
comfortable in the eighteenth century beside 
Johnson and Akenside. His frank and not 
undiscriminating admiration for Dante is there- 
fore significant of the immense change that had 
come over the English mind with respect to the 
vital things of poetry. It is quite to be ex- 
pected that men of spiritual insight — such, for 
example, as Shelley, the younger Hallam (he 
of the " etherial brows "), Gladstone, Carlyle — 
will be attracted to the divine Poet. 

The general impression made by this volum- 
inous comment is one of relative poverty. It 
is a dark mass of prejudice, error, and ignor- 
ance, shot through only here and there by bright 
flashes of insight. So this, we murmur, is the 
reaction of the great English nation upon the 
most spiritually inspired of modern poets ! Even 
those who were most persuasive in drawing the 
attention of the English middle-class to Dante, 
themselves walked rather by faith than by sight. 
Coleridge, Macaulay, Carlyle say so much of 
true and good that the critic may well wink at 
the times of this ignorance. Carlyle has much 
the same fanciful Orphic mode of dealing with 
Dante as has Victor Hugo with Shakespeare. 
Much in the same way, Petrarch divined Homer 
through the cloud of the unknown tongue. Prob- 
ably these writers were just the teachers needed 
by their time. The well-known anecdote of 
Robert Hall, employing at the last his spent 
strength in learning enough Italian to verify 
Macaulay 's parallel between Milton and Dante,

may be taken both as an example and a symbol 
of the effect which all this discussion was having 
upon the class whose chief source of literary 
culture for generations had been first Milton 
and the English Bible, to which more recently 
had been added Shakespeare. It will do much 
to deprovincialize the English-speaking race if 
we ever make the vital discovery that another 
modern nation has produced a poet not decisively 
inferior to Shakespeare in size and range, and 
fully Milton's equal in art, in piety, in loftiness 
of character. 

In 1850, six years after the date chosen by 
Dr. Toynbee for the hither limit of his collec- 
tion, appeared the first really adequate critical 
survey in English of the Tuscan poet. It is a 
pity that a somewhat undue respect for the per- 
formance of Cary should have induced the editor 
to stop short of a date that would have made 
it natural to ornament his collection with 
Church's Essay on Dante, which in absolute 
value far transcends all that these volumes con- 
tain. For just and sympathetic and intelligent 
criticism of Dante in English, no reader need 
go back farther than to that Essay. The present 
work, valuable as it may be historically, is only 
a history of the wanderings in the Wilderness, 
and brings one barely to the border of the Land 
of Promise. 

Theophile Gautier somewhere observes that 
the human race is so wanting in originality as 
never to have invented more than seven deadly 
sins. He had only to read the " Inferno " to 
learn that Dante himself had recognized the 
inadequacy of that sevenfold framework to close 
in all human badness. Dante follows the con- 
ventional category down to the walls of the City 
of Dis, whereupon he abruptly drops it, widen- 
ing his classification of sins with the narrowing 
of the bottomless pit. On the other hand, in 
the " Purgatorio " he finds the sevenfold divi- 
sion sufficient for his purpose. This variation 
has puzzled many critics, who have made rather 
inconclusive attempts to account for it. There 
is a legend that the composition of the " Inferno " 
was interrupted, after the completion of seven 
cantos, by the exile of the poet. Such a cir- 
cumstance might explain an apparent change in 
the scheme of the work. Probably most readers 
have been content with the feeling that too exact 
a parallelism between the parts would have been 
inartistic. The " Inferno " and the " Purga- 
torio " are symmetrical, without being identical, 
in plan. In his dissertation upon the moral 
system of the " Inferno," Mr. Reade, as becomes 
an Oxford don, approaches the subject by the 



dialectical road. It is a very cogent piece of 
reasoning, bristling with quotations in Latin 
from St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante's great theo- 
logical authority, from whom, as Mr. Reade 
proves, the poet does not radically deviate. The 
learned and logical author is not lacking in 
trenchancy. He remarks that if therms, or 
inward criterion, of all crime must always have 
been one of the seven capital vices (which, by 
the way, are not to be confused with the seven 
deadly sins), then " iniquity seems, after all, to 
be a meagre profession, failing in a very marked 
manner to satisfy the ambition of those who find 
the path of virtue too narrow." Students will 
find this work a valuable criticism of, and sup- 
plement to, the essays of Witte and Moore on 
the subject. Melville B. Anderson. 



A Venerable American Preacher.* 



The beneficent life and interesting personality 
of a venerable American preacher, teacher, 
and reformer, the Rev. Washington Gladden, 
are revealed in the recently published volume 
of his " Recollections." Not only to members 
of his own congregation, to each of whom Dr. 
Gladden is both a devoted pastor and a sincere 
friend, but to his wider parish, the American 
people, the book makes its strong and direct 
appeal. The earlier chapters are distinctly 
autobiographical, sketching the influences and 
the environment that shaped his character. 
Later chapters, for perhaps the second third of 
the book, are in chronological order ; while the 
portion of the work centred around his pastor- 
ate in Columbus, Ohio, deals with the more 
important phases of religious and social thought, 
the industrial and civic questions, of the past 
thirty years. A fine sense of personal reserve 
and broad tolerance for opinions from which 
the author dissents are shown throughout the 
book. Whatever savors of fraud, of political 
hysteria or moral delinquency, is sternly though 
briefly rebuked ; but otherwise a spirit of optim- 
ism and kindliness sheds gentle light alike 
upon memories of the past and prophecy of the 
future. 

Himself one of our foremost religious teach- 
ers, whatever Dr. Gladden tells us of his own 
religious experience possesses particular interest. 
His boyhood training was strictly Calvinistic, 
and he unquestioningly accepted the doctrine

of original sin, by which all mankind had lost 
communion with God. This communion, even 
as a child, he desired above all things to regain ; 
but though he tried a thousand times, he never 
felt that u emotional or ecstatic experience " he 
had been taught to expect. He says : 

i( I have often wondered, in later rears, that my faith 
did not give way ; that I did not become an atheist. It 
was the memory of my father, and the consistent piety 
of my uncle, I suppose, which made that impossible. 
But that little unplastered room under the rafters in the 
old farmhouse, where I lay so many nights, when the 
house was still, looking out through the casement upon 
the unpitying stars, has a story to tell of a soul in great 
perplexity and trouble because it could not find God." 

It was not till his eighteenth year that a wise 
friend showed him that he had but to trust in 
God's love, walk in the ways of service, and 
confide in his friendship. This single word 
friendship has since then dominated all his 
religious thought. He sums it up in almost the 
last paragraph of the book : 

'■ I am fain to believe that the time is drawing near 
when the Christian church will be able to discern and 
declare the simple truth that Religion is nothing but 
Friendship ; friendship with God and with men. I have 
been thinking much about it in these last days, and I 
cannot make it mean anything else ; so far as I can see, 
that is all there is to it. Religion is friendship — 
friendship first with the great Companion, of whom 
Jesus told us, who is always nearer to us than we are to 
ourselves, and whose inspiration and help is the greatest 
fact of human experience. To be in harmony with his 
purposes, to be open to his suggestions, to be in con- 
scious fellowship with Him, — this is religion on its 
Godward side. Then, turning manward, friendship 
sums it all up. To be friends with everybody; to fill 
every human relation with the spirit of friendship; is 
there anything more than this that the wisest and best 
of men can hope to do ? " 

The consistent avowal of this faith has always 
put Dr. Gladden among the leaders who turned 
away from dogma to the practical test of con- 
duct. In consequence, his right to stay in the 
fellowship of the church was called in question ; 
but as a M Sta\"-inner " rather than as a " Come- 
outer," he preferred to hold to fellowship that 
was dear and needful, and that, as differences 
once emphasized have disappeared, has grown 
increasingly dear. Of his feeling on this point 
he speaks very clearly : 

" The duty of liberal men to stay in the churches to 
which they belong — if they can be tolerated there — 
and, by kindness and patience and fidelity to the truth 
as they see it, to do what they can to enlighten and 
broaden the fellowship of those churches, has always 
appeared to me very plain." 

How far such conduct on the part of a few 
leaders has liberalized popular opinion is illus- 
trated by the fact, cited in this connection, that 
in the early seventies Dr. Gladden stood alone 



in a company of twenty Congregational clergy- 
men in feeling that it was safe to tell the people 

, that the verse 1 John, 5:7, was admitted by 

i scholars to be spurious. 

Dr. Gladden was for several years, from 1871 
to 1875, engaged in editorial work on the staff 
of " The Independent." In that capacity he 
contended vigorously against " immoral theol- 
ogy," as he unequivocally termed the Calvinistic 
theories. The issue can perhaps be best stated 
in the concluding words of one of his editorials, 
reproduced in this volume : 

" For our own part we say, with all emphasis, that 
between such a theology as this and atheism we should 
promptly choose the latter." 

In his pulpit he has never hesitated to speak 
with equal directness, and in mentioning various 
calls to undertake educational work he expresses 
himself as follows : 

" I do not believe that there is any place of influence 
in the world in which a man can be as free as in the 
Christian pulpit. . . . Unquestionably there is cowardice 
and subserviency in the pulpit, as everywhere else. But 
there need not be. ... I have been saying things, with 
no sense of restraint, during the last fifty years, that I 
should not have been so likely to say if I had been a 
journalist or a college professor. ... I doubt if any 
other kind of work would have given me so large an 
opportunity as my churches in North Adams and 

; Springfield and Columbus have given me to speak my 
deepest thought. 

"But it has not all been criticism or controversy. 
How far from it ! The great themes of the ideal life 

, are, after all, the supreme interests. The insights, the 
aspirations, the convictions, the hopes, the purposes 
which flow into our lives from the realms about us and 
above us — how much of our peace and strength depend 
upon them ! These things of the Spirit are the great 
realities. The existence of that world in which our 
higher nature dwells and from which we draw our 
inspirations is not a matter of conjecture. Herbert 
Spencer himself, the great agnostic, declared that we 
are more sure of the Unknown Reality, out of which 
all physical forces and laws proceed, than we are of our 
own existence. By our scientific logic we cannot define 
it, but we cannot think without assuming it. And 
that which our scientific logic cannot define is made 
known to us in our religious experience. It is with 
these realities of the unseen realm that our faith makes 
us acquainted. And these, after all, are the ' fountain 
light of all our day, the master light of all our seeing.' 
It is in the light of them that everything else gets value 
and significance. They are the only certainties." 

Especially the conclusion of this passage is note- 
worthy. The abiding sense of spiritual verities, 
together with the idea of God's friendship, — 
these two things are the cardinal points of all 
Dr. Gladden's teaching and living. 

More than once Dr. Gladden has been instru- 
mental in the settlement of social and political 
questions. He initiated and guided to its suc- 
cessful consummation the movement to amend

the Constitution of Ohio abolishing the October 
elections. He also drafted the petition to Presi- 
dent Roosevelt, in 1902, to intervene in the coal 
strike. All facts of this sort are modestly men- 
tioned in this volume, but they may serve here 
to call attention to the deep sympathy with the 
working classes that has always characterized 
his ministry. On the duty of the clergy to 
inform themselves upon social and economic 
questions, he expresses himself very strongly. 
" The plea of religious teachers that they are incom- 
petent to deal with social questions is a fearful self- 
accusation. They have no right to be incompetent. 
Whatever else they are ignorant of, they must not be 
ignorant respecting matters which concern the very life 
of the organization they represent. . . . Shall the 
teacher of religion confess that in the arena where char- 
acter is mainly lost or won, where the life of the church 
is at stake, where the destiny of the nation is trembling 
in the balance, he is unfit for efficient service ? " 

Space forbids further consideration of this 
interesting and suggestive volume. The just 
and kindly characterizations of many men of 
distinction, the occasional flashes of humor, and 
the sense for diction everywhere shown, make 
it a book that is hard to lay aside till the last 
page has been read. But the best thing about 
it all is that it reveals the personality of the 
author. Lewis A. Rhoades. 



The Government of Cities.* 



Among recent substantial additions to the 
literature of municipal affairs are two notable 
books by Professors Goodnow and Munro, law- 
yers and political scientists both, who have set 
forth the product of recent research in that 
always interesting field of our " conspicuous 
failure." Their purposes are distinct, but they 
have an important relation, and the conjunction 
is interesting. Mr. Munro's three chapters are 
so many monographs, describing with intense 
concreteness and little generalization the present 
condition of French, Prussian, and English 
cities. Mr. Goodnow, on the other hand, is 
analytical. For him, the " city," whenever and 
wherever he can find it, is a political and admin- 
istrative form, whose evolution is to be traced, 
whose structure and functions are to be studied, 
that he may discover the laws of its being, the 
principles of its organization. 

We have long been told that, whatever the 
constitutional unsatisfactoriness of European

Bennett Munro, Ph.D. New York : The Macmillan Co.

York : The Century Co. 



states, their cities at least are well governed. 
Mr. Munro's book is intended, the author says, 
to provide an " introduction to the study " of 
those foreign city governments. About one-half 
the volume is given to the cities of England ; the 
remainder, in equal portions, to those of France 
and Prussia. In each case an historical intro- 
duction gives us the background for our picture 
of the present day commune, or Stadt, or 
borough ; then follows an account of the repre- 
sentative bodies and the magistracies, their re- 
spective powers and their relations to each other. 
Incidentally, numerous striking features are 
described, to a very few of which attention may 
here be directed. 

A singularly valuable feature of Mr. Munro's 
book is the discussion of elections. Suffrage 
qualifications, parties and their methods, pro- 
visions against corrupt practices, the calibre of 
men elected, — all these and other features are 
treated elaborately. Regarding supplementary 
elections, required when the first ballot shows 
no majority or an insufficient proportion of the 
registration, it is perhaps a little surprising to 
find a preference shown for the French over the 
Prussian system. The Prussian voter must 
choose between the two standing highest at the 
first balloting ; the Frenchman is free, and may 
even elect, by a mere plurality, one not men- 
tioned at the first ballot. However, he concludes 
that in both cases equally the system encourages 
a first ballot that is scattering and ineffectual, 
inconsiderable factions making such showing as 
they can to win recognition from the favorities. 
The protection of the voter's independence by a 
secret ballot, he shows to be utterly wanting in 
Prussia ; with the result (partly due to other 
causes) that abstention is an evil of serious pro- 
portions. In France, he says, the ballot is secret 
only when the voter "troubles to make it so," 
and apparently it is made a matter of trouble 
to him. The American reader cannot fail to be 
struck with the shortness of the ballot abroad. 
The annual choice of a councillor or two, possibly 
a prominent executive officer also, is an electoral 
task which the voter can be expected to perform 
with some degree of satisfaction. It is feared 
that much of the " intelligent vote " in America 
would wander, hopelessly lost, on our vast 
blanket-ballots, but for the convenient party 
emblem. In these days of legislation by statute or 
constitution as the cure-all for our municipal pains, 
it will be wholesome to reflect that the change in 
English boroughs, from 1832 when conditions 
were "about as bad as they could well be," to the 
admired present, was wrought by an alteration in

the " spirit not the form of local administration,' 
for the organs of municipal government . . . are 
now almost exactly the same in structure and in 
functions as they were before 1835." 

Professor Goodnow has long been regarded as 
an expert in municipal affairs ; in lecture, text- 
book, scientific treatise, and commission report, 
he has been forming opinion and solving prob- 
lems with increasing influence and authority. 
AYe suspect that college classes may be disap- 
pointed in his present book. His paragraphs 
do not lend themselves readily to analysis and 
orderly grouping ; the paragraph headings are 
useless and often misleading ; the argument is 
sometimes obscurely developed. But it is not as 
text-writer that we value Mr. Goodnow ; rather 
is he an expert, whose opinions we must have 
and shall rely on. And the book is crammed 
with suggestive comment, comparison, conclu- 
sion. After introducing us to the phenomena 
of urban life generally, he devotes several chap- 
ters to an historical exposition of the thesis that 
cities have progressively played their part as 
(1) city-states, (2) mere administrative districts 
of states, (3) local political beings, having needs 
of their own and requiring organization adapted 
to those needs. At once we are in the presence 
of the problem with which our author seems to 
be constantly preoccupied : viz., municipal home- 
rule. It is interesting to observe that he regards 
home rule as desirable, not in itself and of course, 
but only where populations are fit to be entrusted 
with the right to vary municipal policy, and 
when municipal policy may be varied without 
detriment to the state. Centralization, he has 
told us before, may be legislative or administra- 
tive. He now observes that England has for 
some years past been experimenting with the 
continental method, and has found that this 
substitution of administrative for legislative 
control, instead of repressing local life, has 
" been accompanied by a great increase " in 
municipal activity. He distinctly favors a 
further introduction of administrative control 
among us. He believes that " the legislature 
must in the nature of things be a partisan po- 
litical body," and, as we should readily agree, 
administrative control stands a better chance of 
being firm, consistent, and expert. 

The author is well persuaded that America 
is wrong in the method by which she distributes 
powers to municipalities. Enumeration of 
powers granted by the legislature, and strict 
limitation to those powers by the judiciary, — 
the municipal corporation on the same plane 
with any private corporation, bearing the burden 



of that hostile presumption which public welfare 
requires that the ordinary corporation shall 
bear, — this arrangement is inconvenient and 
unjust to cities ; for the latter are public rather 
than private bodies, and the first requisite for 
the public welfare is that their powers shall be 
adequate. The Continental method is preferred, 
endowing cities with powers by general grant, 
limited only at need by general legislation, or 
more conveniently by the devices of administra- 
tive control, a system which affords sufficient 
safeguards but allows free growth according to 
varying circumstances. 

Having thus dealt with the position of the 
city in the modern state, Professor Goodnow 
devotes a chapter each to the Executive, the 
Council, and the Participation of the People; 
and then a chapter each to the five great admin- 
istrative departments of Police, Charities and 
Correction, Education, Local Improvements, 
and Finance. He holds that the city electorate 
in the United States is not properly safeguarded, 
and has doubts, therefore, of the general utility 
of the municipal referendum. As to the city 
legislature, it is interesting to observe that 
" both practical men and theorists . . . are 
tending towards a partial rehabilitation of the 
municipal council." The commission system 
has this important characteristic, that in con- 
centrating legislative and administrative author- 
ity in the same hands it wholly abandons the 
idea of the separation of powers in city gov- 
ernment. That principle had never been appli- 
cable, and the attempt to secure it was found by 
bitter experience to be "most disastrous." The 
official system and the organization of its mem- 
bers presents a very difficult problem, whose 
discussion brings in valuable incidental remarks 
on several features of administration in general, 
e. g. t tenure of office, removal for cause, appoint- 
ment by competitive examination. A properly 
organized administration must show, (1) amen- 
ability to popular control, (2) administrative 
efficiency. The German system sacrifices the 
former to the latter, the American vice versa. 
The English system (to which the author con- 
stantly displays strong leanings) secures both in a 
high degree. The English administrative officer 
is well paid, and is thus supplied with a motive 
for becoming expert ; he is protected in office not 
so much by law as by public opinion ; there is an 
antidote to bureaucracy in his legal position, for 
he is under, and not superior to, the council com 
mittee, the non-expert element of the system. 

Upon the form of the headship of departments 
conflict has long raged between the advocates of 



50 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



the board plan and the single-commissioner 
plan. Granting that the latter secures greater 
responsibility, and expecting to be branded as 
" heretical," Professor Goodnow argues for the 
board plan, (1) from English and German ex- 
perience generally, (2) from our own experience 
in educational administration, (3) because it se- 
cures greater permanence of tenure in the heads 
of departments, boards being only gradually re- 
newed from year to year, (4) because " it is the 
only form . . . which makes permanently pos- 
sible popular non-professional administration," 
that is, that participation of laymen in adminis- 
tration which he admiringly observes on such a 
wide scale in Prussia under Gneist's influence. 
Finally, a word must be said as to the rela- 
tion of municipalities to public services, the ab- 
sorbing political issue of " municipal trading." 
European opinion is almost unanimous that cities 
should " under proper limitations have the power 
to enter upon the field of municipal ownership 
and operation, and even in the United States 
opinion is gradually coming to approximate the 
opinion of Europe," though as yet few American 
cities have the requisite legal powers. Local 
regulation of transportation services has often 
proved unsatisfactory, partly because of the in- 
adequate legal powers of cities, partly because 
of inefficiency and corruption in their govern- 
ments. Possibly for this part of the problem 
a proper solution has been found in the state 
commission, already used to good effect by New 
York and some few other states. But in other 
departments, lighting, housing, etc., the sphere 
of direct municipal activity is gradually extend- 
ing. Private parties can often render better 
service at less cost, but the question is not only 
economic ; it is social. " It is wise to endure a 
slight waste in processes of production in order 
to secure greater equality in distribution or a 
greater regard for general social needs." As 
the sewers have been universally municipalized, 
so are water- works generally ; and other services 
will probably follow the same way. In every 
case the city must sit down first and count the 
cost, for what it gains in general social conven- 
ience it must pay for, often not from dividends, 
but in taxes. This absolutely requires that 
realization of the community of interest between 
voters and tax-payers that is so essential to so- 
cial peace, and yet so far from obvious or easy 
to secure. It was easy and natural, perhaps, 
in primitive times. It is extremely difficult in 
these days of highly concentrated wealth and 
vast voting but property-less populations. 

Henry E. Spencer. 



Recent Poetry.* 



When a poet has " climbed to the snows of age," 
his voice may lose something of its warmth and 
richness, but acquire in their place the note of 
prophecy. 

" From labours through the night, outworn, 

Above the hills the front of morn, 

We see, whose eyes to heights are raised, 

And the world's wise may deem us crazed. 

While yet her lord lies under seas, 

She takes us as the wind the trees' 

Delighted leafage ; all in song 

We mount to her, to her belong." 

There is little need to name George Meredith as 
the author of these lines, or of the following equally 
characteristic quatrains : 

" Once I was part of the music I heard 

On the boughs or sweet between earth and sky, 
For joy of the beating of wings on high 
My heart shot into the breast of the bird. 

" I hear it now and I see it fly 

And a life in wrinkles again is stirred, 
My heart shoots into the breast of the bird, 
As it will for sheer love till the last long sigh." 

These examples from the precious sheaf of Mere- 
dith's " Last Poems " vividly recall the brave free 
spirit that winged its flight a few months ago. Sev- 
eral of the poems offer retrospective pictures of the 
Napoleonic days at which Meredith's imagination 
always took fire. 

" Their facts are going headlong on the tides, 
Like commas on a line of History's page ; 
Nor that which once they took for Truth abides, 
Save in the form of youth enlarged from age. 

"Meantime give ear to woodland notes around, 
Look on our Earth full-breasted to the sun : 
So was it when their poets heard the sound, 
Beheld the scene : in them our days are one."

Nelson and Trafalgar are the subjects of two noble 
poems, and the moral drawn from these historical 
musings is thus convincingly put : 

" Our cry for cradled Peace, while men are still 

The three-parts brute which smothers the divine. 
Heaven answers : Guard it with forethoughtful will, 
Or buy it ; all your gains from War resign. 

•• A land, not indefensibly alarmed, 

May see, unwarned by hint of friendly gods, 
Between a hermit crab at all points armed, 
And one without a shell, decisive odds." 

Ireland, Russia, and Italy receive generous tributes 
in this volume. The stanzas upon u The Centenary 
of Garibaldi " come to this splendid close : 

■' Down the long roll of History will run 
The story of these deeds, and speed his race 
Beneath defeat more hotly to embrace 
The noble cause and trust to another sun. 

" And lo, that sun is in Italia's skies 
This day, by grace of his good sword in part. 
It beckons her to keep a warrior heart 
For guard of beauty, all too sweet a prize. 

•• Earth gave him : blessed be the Earth that gave. 
Earth Master crowned his honest work on earth : 
Proudly Italia names his place of birth : 
The bosom of Humanity his grave." 

The stately lines for the Milton tercentenary also 
call for thankful mention, and we reluctantly refrain 
from quoting a part of them. Enough has been said 
to show that these new poems are much more than 
crumbs swept from the Meredithian board ; they 
constitute indeed a substantial addition to the poet's 
finer work. 

Mrs. William Sharp has made a selection from 
the poems of her late husband, drawing upon the 
five volumes published under his own name, for the 
purpose of supplying a companion to the volume 
which he published under the assumed name of 
" Fiona Macleod." A few poems never before 
brought into book form are added to the closing 
section. One of these later poems, " On a Night- 
ingale in April," may be taken for our illustration 
of a poet whose sweet and wistful song has qualities 
that repay a close examination. 

" The yellow moon is a dancing phantom 
Down secret ways of the flowing shade ; 
And the waveless stream has a murmuring whisper 
Where the alders wave. 

" Not a breath, not a sigh, save the slow stream's whisper : 
Only the moon is a dancing blade 
That leads a host of the Crescent warriors 
To a phantom raid. 

•' Out of the Lands of Faerie a summons, 

A long, strange cry that thrills through the glade : — 
The grey-green glooms of the elm are stirring, 
Newly afraid. 

u Last heard, white music, under the olives 

Where once Theocritus sang and played — 
Thy Thracian song is the old new wonder 
O moon-white maid ! "' 

Since several of Sharp's volumes are now out of 
print, this selection of the best in all of them is 



highly acceptable, coming, as it does, from the hands 
of the person most competent to make it. 

The last work done by Eugene Lee- Hamilton took 
the form of a cycle of twenty-nine sonnets conse- 
crated to the memory of his lost child who died 
when but two years old. u Minima Bella " he 
caressingly called her, and that is the title given to 
the poems in which she is enshrined. The one 
which we quote, beautiful and impressive as it is, 
offers only a fair average example of the extraor- 
dinary series to which it belongs. 

" Mantled in purple dusk, Imperial Death. 
Thy throne Time's mist, thy crown the clustered stars. 
Thy orb the world ; — did Nature's countless wars 
Yield insufficient incense for thy breath '? 

" Hadst not enough with all who troop beneath 
Thy inward-opening gates, whose shadowy bars 
Give back nor kings in their triumphal cars, 
Nor the worn throngs that old age hurrieth '? 

•" sateless Death, most surely it was thou. 
(A thousand ages, yea, and longer still, 
Before the words were heard in Galilee) 

" That saidst with dark contraction of thy brow, 
While through all Nature ran an icy chill : 
• Now let the little children come to me ? ' " 

The pathos of these poems is almost intolerable, but 
it is redeemed and sanctified by their loveliness. 
The cycle is a worthy pendant to those " Sonnets of 
the Wingless Hours " which first revealed to the 
world the full stature of this poet. The present 
volume is edited by his widow, who contributes a 
few pages of biographical notes. 

Mr. Watson's " New Poems " include the sting- 
ing and indiscreet verses to " The Woman with a 
Serpent's Tongue " that recently provided the jour- 
nalism of two nations with a nine days' sensation. 
The volume contains much other matter far worthier 
of attention, and notably — since the author is now 
a visitor to these shores — a stately invocation " To 
the Invincible Republic," from which we take pleas- 
ure in producing the central passage. 

" And as thou art vast, 
So are thy perils vast, that evermore 
In thine own house are bred ; nor least of these 
That fair and fell Delilah, Luxury, 
That shears the hero's strength away, and brings 
Palsy on nations. Flee her loveliness, 
For in the end her kisses are a sword. 
Strong sons hast thou begotten, natures rich 
In scorn of riches, greatly simple minds : 
No land in all the world hath memories 
Of nobler children : let it not be said 
That if the peerless and the stainless one, 
The man of Yorktown and of Valley Forge, — 
Or he of tragic doom, thy later born, 
He of the short plain word that thrilled the world 
And freed the bondman. — let it not be said 
That if to-day these radiant ones returned, 
They would behold thee changed beyond all thought 
From that austerity wherein thy youth 
Was nurtured, those large habitudes of soul." 

These lines will illustrate Mr. Watson's chief poetic 
gift — an aptitude for the fitting characterization 
of significant men and events. When he attempts

this task, he is always restrained and dignified, 
provided only his theme is far enough removed 
from the passions of his own time and environment. 
His " Purple East " sonnets, and his denunciation 
of the war in South Africa, were marred by over- 
vehemence and cloudiness of judgment. Probably 
this should be said also of the present lines upon the 
late King of Belgium, although their effectiveness 
is not to be denied. 

" No zeal, no Faith inspired this Leopold, 
Nor any madness of half-splendid birth, 
Merely he loosed the hounds that rend and slay 
That he might have his fill of loathsome gold. 
Embalm him, Time ! Forget him not, Earth ! 
Trumpet his name, and flood his deeds with day ! " 

A group of seventeen " Sonnets to Miranda," clearly 
of the nature of a personal confession, forms a con- 
spicuous feature of this volume. Mr. Watson is not 
so happy when he affects playfulness, for his gambols 
are rather like those of a dancing bear. Vivacity is 
not his affair, and his efforts to be sprightly do not 
exactly come off. But, despite his misguided experi- 
ments, he remains one of the noblest of our living 
poets — a fact strangely forgotten by those who have 
recently been overwhelming him with vituperation. 

The " New Poems " of Mr. Richard Le Gallienne 
seem to be the product of about ten years — at least 
they go back to the war in South Africa. Most of 
them are pretty futilities, although now and then a 
simple, sincere strain appeals to us in the deeper 
fashion. Such a strain is heard in " The Cry of the 
Little Peoples." 

" The Cry of the Little Peoples went up to God in vain ; 
The Czech, and the Pole, and the Finn, and the Schleswig 
Dane. 

" We ask but a little portion of the green, ambitious earth ; 
Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth." 

A rather striking story (with a moral) is told in 
the " Ballad of the Sinful Lover." 

" Four years he sinned, because she died — 
With base corroding anodyne 
He numbed the noble pain in him, 
Four years he herded with the swine. 

"And then at last he died, and went, 
With hurry of immortal feet, 
To seek in the Eternal Life 

The face that he had died to meet. 

" Up all the stairways of the sky 
Laughing he ran, at every door 
Of the long corridors of heaven 

He knocked, and cried out ' Heliodore ! ' 

" In shining rooms sat the sweet saints, 

Each at her little task of joy ; 
Old eyes, all young again with heaven, 
Watched angel girl and angel boy. 

" And o'er the fields of Paradise, 

Scattered like flowers, the lovers passed 
All rainbows — saying each to each 

Heaven's two words : ' At last ! At last !' " 

But Heliodore would have nothing of the sinner, 
which is the moral already referred to. 

It takes courage to write an epic nowadays, but 
Mr. Alfred Noyes, greatly daring, has essayed no 



less a task, and carried it to triumphant success. 
His subject is " Drake," probably the greatest epic 
theme that English history can offer, and his poem 
is a full-blooded composition of such high and sus- 
tained interest that it makes breathless reading, and 
causes us almost to forget that we are dealing with 
a supposedly outworn literary form. It culminates, 
of course, in the defeat of the Armada, and its 
heightened diction may be adequately illustrated 
by this passage : 

" None but the everlasting voice 
Of him who fought at Salamis might sing 
The fight of that dread Sabbath. Not mankind 
Waged it alone. War waged in heaven that day, 
Where Michael and his angels drave once more 
The hosts of darkness ruining down the abyss 
Of Chaos. Light against darkness, Liberty 
Against all dark old despotism, unsheathed 
The sword in that great hour. Behind the strife 
Of men embattled deeps beyond all thought 
Moved in their awful panoply, as move 
Silent, invisible, swift, under the clash 
Of waves and flash of foam, huge ocean glooms 
And vast reserves of inappellable power. 
The bowsprits ranked on either fore-front seemed 
But spear-heads of those dread antagonists 
Invisible : the shuddering sails of Spain 
Dusk with the shadow of death, the sunward sails 
Of England full-fraught with the breath of God." 

This noble poem is almost worthy to be named in 
the same breath with Swinburne's magnificent ode 
upon the same subject, and it was, indeed, completed 
just in time to greet the eye of the master now dead, 
and to win his unstinted praise. 

The " Collected Poems of the late Arthur Upson " 
are published in two dignified and almost sumptuous 
volumes, with an editorial introduction by Professor 
Richard Burton. From this introduction we learn 
that the poet was born in Camden, N. Y., in 1877, 
that he was busily writing at the tender age of nine, 
that in 1894 he removed to St. Paul and entered 
the University of Minnesota, that his college life was 
suspended from 1896 to 1900 on account of ill 
health, that it was finally resumed and all but com- 
pleted, that in 1906 he was appointed an instructor 
in the University, and that in 1908, at the age of 
thirty-one, he was drowned from his boat in a Minne- 
sota lake. We may hardly say of him, in view of 
the volume and value of his accomplished perform- 
ance, that he is to be classed with " the inheritors of 
unfilled renown ; " but we may express a more than 
perfunctory regret that the springs of a fountain of 
beauty should have been sealed in such untimely 
and tragic fashion. The evidence is clear in these 
two volumes that their author was a poet of the kind 
that can transmute all experience into beauty, and 
that our literature suffered no ordinary loss in his 
death. He had not become widely known, although 
no less than seven volumes of his verse were published 
before he died, and he had won the esteem of those 
whose business it is to keep themselves informed con- 
cerning the poetic movement. Aldrich, for example 
once wrote : " I am afraid he is too fine for mime'

diate popularity ; but that does n't matter. It is not 
the many but the few that give a man his place in 
literature. The many are engaged canning meat 
and manipulating pious life insurance companies." 
Certainly he was not one of the " Failures " char- 
acterized in his fine sonnet thus entitled. 

" They bear no laurels on their sunless brows, 

Nor anght within their pale hands as they go ; 

They look as men accustomed to the slow 
And level onward course 'neath drooping boughs. 
Who may these be no trumpet doth arouse, 

These of the dark processionals of woe, 

Unpraised, unblamed, but whom sad Acheron's flow 
Monotously lulls to leaden drowse ? 
These are the Failures. Clutched by Circumstance, 

They were — say not too weak ! — too ready prey 
To their own fear whose fixed Gorgon glance 

Made them as stone for aught of great essay ; — 
Or else they nodded when their Master-Chance 

Wound his one signal, and went on his way." 

Of the thirty-three stanzas that bloom " In an 
Oxford Garden " we cull two of the fairest. 

" Some dust of Eden eddies round us yet. 

Some clay o' the Garden, clinging in the breast, 

Down near the heart yet bides unmanifest. 
Last eve in gardens strange to me I let 
The path lead far ; and, lo, my vision met 

Old, forfeit hopes. I, as on homeward quest. 

By recognizing trees was bidden rest, 
And pitying leaves looked down and sighed, ' Forget.' " 



" A great nelumbo heavy on the breast 

Of heaven's tranquil lake must be the moon 
Above this garden in the still night's noon, 

Bending the gold of her refulgent crest. 

Thns to the surface of these days of rest 

Through all my absent idlesse, late and soon, 
The thought of you doth blossom and the boon 

Of the dear face that waits me down the West.*' 

As an example of the pure lyric, it would not be 
easy to match the following : 

" Flame at the core of the world, 
And flame in the red rose-tree ; 
The one is the fire of the ancient spheres, 

The other is Junes to be ; 
And, oh, there 's a flame that is both their flames 
Here at the heart of me ! 

" As strong as the fires of stars, 

As the prophet rose-tree true, 
The fire of my life is tender and wild, 

Its beauty is old and new ; 
For out of the infinite past it came 

With the love in the eyes of you ! " 

The range of this poet is wide, and he finds inspira- 
tion alike under home and alien skies. Many of 
his pieces are occasional or tributary, fancies elab- 
orated at sight of some quaint object or compelling 
monument, at thought of some noble deed or heroic 
soul. He has the Midas touch that turns every- 
thing to gold. And often, when some matter of 
deep human concern compels his imagination, his 
utterance becomes prophetic. His fine sonnet on 
"The Statue of Liberty (New York Harbour, 
A. D. 2900 ) " sounds a needed note of warning to 
an over-complacent nation. 



" Here once, the records show, a land whose pride 
Abode in Freedom's watchword ! And once here 
The port of traffic for a hemisphere, 
With great gold-piling cities at her side ! 
Tradition says, superbly once did bide 

Their sculptured goddess on an island near, 
With hospitable smile and torch kept clear 
For all wild hordes that sought her o'er the tide. 
'Twas centuries ago. But this is true : 

Late the fond tyrant who misrules our land, 

Bidding his serfs dig deep in marshes old, 

Trembled, not knowing wherefore, as they drew 

From out this swampy bed of ancient mould 

A shattered torch held in a mighty hand." 

Thia is worthy to be set beside Aldrich's no finer son- 
net, "Unguarded Gates." The more we delve within 
this quarry, the more we bring treasure-trove to the 
surface. Sweetness and light, intelligence and 
spirituality, are here, and always united with a 
fluent and admirable technique. Two of the longer 
poems are dramatic in form, and a third of this kind, 
" Gauvaine of the Retz," went down with the poet 
in his Lake Spezzia of Minnesota. We have space 
only to quote the gnomic lines which end "The 
Tides of Spring," a dramatic romance of ancient 
Scotland. 

" I think each soul spins wisely as he may, 
And God, who weaves the garment of this life, 
Draws tight the meshes of our crossing threads, 
And bleaches in the sunshine of His love." 

" The Poems of William Winter " again offer us 
an example of a poet's collected life-work, in this 
case, however, of one whose chief distinction is that 
of the essayist and dramatic critic, and, happily, of 
one who in advanced age still lives to exemplify 
unchilled sensibilities and undimmed intellectual 
vigor. Mr. Winter's poetical output has been con- 
siderable, and even this large volume includes only 
the author's final selection from a much larger mass 
of material. He is an adept in the facile old- 
fashioned rhythms, and is most felicitous when pay- 
ing tribute to some great spirit or mourning the loss 
of some cherished friend. His feelings " At Shake- 
speare's Grave " are thus expressed : 

' " Here the divinest of all thoughts descended : 

Here the sweet heavens their sweetest boon let fall : 
Upon this hallowed ground began and ended 
The life that knew, and felt, and uttered all." 

It is a commonplace thought, perhaps, but one made 
beautiful by sincerity of feeling. From the " Coronal 
for Stedman " — a fifty years' associate — we take 
these stanzas : 

" Thy soul is music : from its deeps o'erflowing, — 
With the glad freedom of the wild-bird's wing, 
Where icy gales o 'er sunlit seas are blowing, — 
It sings because divinely born to sing. 

" No stain is on thy banner : grandly streaming, 
Its diamond whiteness leads the tuneful host, 
Forever in the front of honor beaming, 

And they that knew thee best must love thee most." 

This singer's wonted garb is that of a graceful and 
tender melancholy, and it becomes him well. Possi- 
bly a bit too sentimental or lachrymose in his strain, 
he is nevertheless a warm-hearted and appealing

poet, whose voice we would not willingly miss from the 
chorus of the now swiftly-dying generation. And it is 
a voice that has never been raised, either in verse or 
prose, save for things lovely and of good report. 

The poems collected under the title of ''The 
Soul's Inheritance " were prepared for publication 
by George Cabot Lodge just before his death. They 
are eight in number, and embody a novel structural 
plan. In each case, the main body of the poem 
(usually in heroic verse) is followed by a group of 
three sonnets, rounding out the thought. Mr. Lodge 
dwelt in an atmosphere of large abstractions, typified 
by such lines as these : 

" Sun, moon, and stars — inviolate firmament — 
Phases of earth's inveterate alchemy 
Of life and death — profound tranquillities, 
Thunders and trepidations of the sea — 
How often have you been to man in spirit 
A liberation and an ecstasy ! 
How often has the soul gone forth with you, 
As with the tide, a stranded caravel 
Issues by noble estuaries, impelled 
By streaming winds and led by the low sun, 
Into the light, into the infinite spaces ! " 

Such verse as this is dignified, but hardly escapes 
the charge of being turgid also. One of the poems, 
"Love in Life," is written mostly in octosyllabics, 
and we quote the concluding sonnet for the sake of 
the unwonted measure. 

" I saw her sandals of grave gold 

Move on the marble, soft as light, 

Her motion was like birds in flight ; 
The bountiful, the new, the old 
Deep secret that no tongue has told 

Was born of her — as is the white 

First flame of day-break from the night. 
As song-birds wake, as flowers unfold. 
And then I kissed her sandals of 

Grave gold, and kissed her hands and mouth ; 

And knew how more serene than song, 
How spacious and how strong is Love ! — 

Spacious as thought is of the truth ; 
Strong as the conscious soul is strong." 

Two of these poems are occasional — one written 
for the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the other for a 
Forefather's Day celebration. * 

Mr. Henry van Dyke is a felicitous writer of 
occasional and personal verse, and we take pleasure 
in extracting from his new volume, "The White 
Bees," two of the four stanzas which he read at the 
funeral of Mr. Stedman. 

" The blue of springtime in your eyes 
Was never quenched by pain ; 
And winter brought your head the crown 

Of snow without a stain. 
The poet's mind, the prince's heart, 

You kept until the end, 
Nor ever faltered in your work. 
Nor ever failed a friend. 

" You followed, through the quest of life, 

The light that shines above 
The tumult and the toil of men, 

And shows us what to love. 
Right loyal to the best you knew, 

Reality or dream, 
You ran the race, you fought the fight, 

A follower of the Gleam." 



From Mr. Madison Cawein we have two new 
volumes. In " The Giant and the Star " he works 
a new and charming vein, for the book is a collection 
of poems which view the world with the eyes of a 
child. 

" Whenever on the windowpane 
I hear the fingers of the rain, 
And in the old trees, near the door, 
The wind that whispers more and more, 
Bright in the light made by the lamp 
I make myself a hunter's carnp. 

" The shadows of the desk and chairs 
Are trees and woods : the corners, lairs 
Where wolves and wildcats lie in wait 
For anyone who walks too late ; 
Upon my knees with my toy-gun 
I hunt and slaughter many a one." 

This is an excursion into Stevenson's own child 
garden, and there are others equally awesome in 
their suggested possibilities. There are also accounts 
of " Toyland " and " The Land of Candy," which 
should make any child's eyes and mouth water. 
We are a little dubious about the pieces in which 
"The Boy Next Door " figures, for the youth seems 
to be a graceless iconoclast. 

"And he said that Old King Cole 
Was a fraud upon the whole ; 
Never had a fiddler 
That could fiddle any where 
By the side of him ; and joked 
While he drank the vilest brew 
From a cracked old bowl ; and smoked 
Worse tobacco ; smiling, too. 

" Cinderella, too ! why, she 
Was a slomp ; just naturally 
Would n't work ; and had big feet — 
Could bave seen them 'cross the street. 
Did n't marry a Prince at all, 
But the ashman. Never at Court 
Or a ball ! She had her gall 
To put that in her report ! " 

Mr. Cawein's " New Poems " is an English edition, 
from which we infer than the poems may not all be 
new for American readers. But many of them 
certainly are, such as the " North Star " series of 
sonnets, and the centenary tributes to Poe and 
Lincoln. We quote one of the sonnets. 

" There is a place among the Cape Ann hills 
That looks from fir-dark summits on the sea, 
Whose surging sapphire changes constantly 
Beneath deep heavens, morning windowsills 
With golden calm, or sunset citadels 
With storm, whose towers the winds' confederacy 
And bandit thunder hold in rebel fee, 
Swooping upon the fisher's sail that swells. 
A place where Sorrow ceases to complain, 
And Life's old cares put all their burdens by, 
And Weariness forgets itself in rest. 
Would that all life were like it ; might obtain 
Its pure repose, its outlook, strong and high, 
That sees, beyond, far Islands of the Blest." 

In such work as this, and some other that we have 
observed of late, Mr. Cawein seems to be acquiring 
the touch of virility which has hitherto been lacking 
in his work, — to be no longer satisfied with the rich 
imagery and melodic loveliness that formerly suf- 
ficed him.

Being on the spot, and a poet of approved worth, 
it was fitting that Mr. Clinton Scollard should write 
the ''Song for the Ter-Centenary of Lake Cham- 
plain " to grace the celebration of last July. His 
poem is in quatrains — numbering thirty-two — 
and the hero is thus characterized : 

" Roland and Bayard ! — he was kin to these ; 

Swerved he no more than magnet from the pole 
As forth he sailed upon the uncharted seas 
With dreams of high adventure in his soul. 

" What foes he faced, what dangers dread he dared, — 
Patient in peace, in war unwavering! 
Unmoved he toiled, unmurmuring he fared, 
Like saintly Louis, the beloved king. 

•' Since then the great Recorder of the Days 

Thousands has scrolled upon his golden book, 
Yet still a sheet of shimmering chxysophrase 

The great lake spreads for whomsoe'er may look." 

In - Pro Patria," Mr. Scollard gives us a score of 
pieces, ballads, and lyrics, upon themes belonging to 
American history. We quote some simple verses 
upon Lafayette. 

•' He left the pleasant primrose-bowers, 
The paths of ease, 
He sought a soldier's arduous hours 
Far o'er the seas. 

"* Within his high, impulsive heart 
Burned freedom's flame, 
And he espoused the patriots' part 
With ardent aim. 

•' He fought unfaltering till the end. — 
The goal, — was won ; 
The fearless and the faithful friend 
Of Washington." 

Correct in sentiment, but hardly more than mechani- 
cal, Mr. Scollard's verses may be allowed a humble 
niche in the temple of our patriotic minstrelsy.

A philoiophet 
the unobviout 



Judged according to President Had- 
ley's recent definition of culture — 
"the opposite of absorption in the 
obvious " — Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton is one of the 
most cultured of mortals. It is the unobvious that 
he sees in ever}- incident, in every commonplace ob- 
ject, in every person : his whole life, indeed, seems 
to be passed in absorption in the unobvious. His 
latest book, " Tremendous Trifles " (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.), is made up of thirty-nine short talks on the 
unsuspected significance of common things. " Let 
us exercise the eye," exhorts the author, " until it 
learns to see the startling facts that run across the 
landscape as plain as a painted fence. Let us be 
ocular athletes. Let us learn to write essays on a 
stray cat or a coloured cloud." The commonest 
things, in his hands, become fruitful of suggestion 
and instruction and entertainment. Once he planned 
to write a book of poems about the things in his 
pockets ; but he found it would be too long, and the 
age of the great epics is past. In one chapter we 



have metaphysics, " the only thoroughly emotional 
thing," in an animated inquiry into the meaning of 
Certainty — even more baffling to Mr. Chesterton 
than the meaning of Truth to some of his contem- 
poraries. Amusing, to those acquainted with the 
author, must be his conception of himself as a pigmy 
viewing the smallest objects as things of vast bulk. 
He aspires not to climb high mountains and over- 
look the kingdoms of the earth. " I will lift up my 
eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help," he 
declares ; u but I will not lift up my carcass to the 
hills, unless it is absolutely necessary," a not un- 
natural resolution, considering his weight and bulk. 
These hasty sketches, reprinted from the London 
'• Daily News," are not uniformly admirable or in- 
teresting, — in fact, they contain pages of whimsical 
trifling wherein the author seems to be writing only 
to fill his allotted space ; but they also contain obser- 
vations and reflections that are so fresh, so droll, so 
shrewd, or so suggestive, as to make the book well 
worth reading. 

™. *_ ,•. The main thesis of the stimulating 
and weakne** book by "A Diplomatist, on our 
of diplomacy . "American Foreign Policy " (Hough- 
ton), is that " A purely defensive diplomacy on the 
part of a great state is as much a heresy as is a navy 
built only for defense." We are open, says the 
author, to attack in two quarters — South America 
and the Orient ; yet we are without allies. For a 
century we were indifferent to foreign intercourse ; 
but the acquisition of the Philippines, which are a 
source of diplomatic and military weakness, has put 
us in the same position as other nations with Asiatic 
possessions, and we must imitate their policies. This 
can be done without an absolute abandonment of our 
traditional policy of no entangling alliances. The 
problem is to find a desirable partner for mutual 
insurance, with no conflicting interests. Our dearest 
foreign policy, the Monroe Doctrine, is as likely to 
be attacked in Manila as in the Caribbean. Dip- 
lomacy would be a far better means of defense than 
an enormous military establishment. The history 
of England in Egypt is a case in point. She first 
secured the consent of disinterested nations, and 
finally that of France, which at first viewed this 
policy through the cannon's sight. Germany and 
Italy are the nations most likely to attack the 
Monroe Doctrine ; but at present the latter is in no 
position to do so. If we could now secure the assent 
of Great Britain, Russia, and France, while Italy is 
weak, she would not later dare to oppose us. In 
this way also Germany and her ally (Austria) might 
be check-mated. That is. something like this might 
be done, if we did not recklessly throw away every 
pawn. A bit of African jungle is no tempting for- 
eign possession, but it might be valuable to cede for 
just such recognition of the Monroe Doctrine as has 
been suggested. Yet we foolishly declined to take 
shares in the Morrocan bank. Likewise we failed 
to lay Japan under any obligation to us, though we 
were decidedly friendly toward her in the recent

war with Russia and were the first to abandon the 
legation at Seoul. Now it is our turn to ask favors, 
and we have nothing on the other side of the ledger. 
The Monroe Doctrine defines our policy toward 
Europe in South American affairs, but it is a nega- 
tive policy on our part toward that region itself. It 
is now time to develop an active South American 
policy, — or, rather, two policies. South of the 
Orinoco our policy should be that of disinterested 
friendliness ; north of that region it should be to 
maintain a sort of suzerainty. The latter might be 
called our Caribbean policy, as it must apply to all 
territory in that region. The Piatt amendment was 
only a foolish tying of hands in Cuba to put off the 
inevitable. Such, in outline, is the foreign policy 
which " A Diplomatist " sets before us. It is not a 
pleasant prospect to contemplate, but we must con- 
fess that the author's reasoning is not altogether 
illogical, if our faces are to remain set as they are 
at present. 

Those who remember Macaulay's 
oflapal Rome, vigorous condemnation of papal mis- 
government, recorded in his journal 
in 1848, will turn with lively interest to Signor R. 
de Cesare's "Last Daysof Papal Rome" (Houghton), 
in order to study in more detail the features of 
Roman administration, and to discover whether 
Pius IX. had mitigated the evils of priestly rule 
which the English traveller summed up in the sen- 
tence, " Old women above, liars and cheats below — 
that is the Papal administration." The subject 
has also a larger interest, because it is the fall of a 
princely power, the beginnings of which run back to 
the last days of the Roman empire. The spectacle 
of such a fall has deep dramatic significance. It 
was something more than a tragic close of an ancient 
rule ; it was the vanishing of the final barrier to the 
completion of the great task of Italian unification. 
Signor de Cesare's treatment ignores none of these 
elements of interest; but it has other claims upon 
our attention. To the student of types of character, 
it offers that finer kind of gossip out of which one 
is able to gain impressions of the personality of the 
principal actors in the drama, — Pius IX., Cardinal 
Antonelli, the Duke of Sermoneta, and of Mgr. de 
Merode. Some of de Cesare's stories of Pius IX. 
remind one of those told by Grant Duff. The Pope 
certainly had a sense of humor, which occasionally 
found strange manifestations. For example, after 
Mentana he received the victors over Garibaldi by 
declaiming "in a loud voice the first octave of 
' Gerusalemme Liberata,' to the great amusement of 
all present "; and in 1870, an hour after the white 
flag had been raised over the Porta Pia, he "re- 
sumed his easy good-humor, and, seating himself 
at his writing-table, composed in all tranquillity a 
charade in three verses on the word tremare (to 
tremble)." In his serious moods the Pope was no less 
individual. De Cesare describes the intense interest 
he took in the direction of the discussions on the 
doctrine of papal infallibility. After the results of 



the war of 1859 have been explained, the interest 
of the volume centres about the attempts to settle 
the Roman question, of which the most startling 
were the schemes of Cavour and Ricasoli. These 
were the first steps toward the Law of Guarantees. 
The fate of Father Passaglia, who was one of the 
negotiators, recalls the recent painful experiences, 
in another field of reconciliation, of the Modernists. 
De Cesare brings out clearly the weak and hesitant 
policy of the Italian ministry on the eve of Mentana. 
He notes, apropos of the battle, that although the 
French chassepots may have done " wonders," the 
" Stutzen carbines of the Pontificals were more 
murderous." In reference to the book as a whole 
it may be added that those who know the Rome of 
the present day will find many interesting pages on 
the topography and social organization of the city of 
a generation or two ago. 

" It is a recognized fact that the work 
tSSSSSlL* the world is largely done by neu- 

rasthenes." Whether this sentiment 
is likely to receive wide endorsement or not, the story 
reported by Dr. Margaret A. Cleaves in " The Auto- 
biography of a Neurasthene " (Richard Badger) tells 
a remarkable tale of success in the active practice of 
medicine on the part of one who, by reason of weak 
inheritance, dwelt for years in the dismal shadow of 
neurasthenia. The incapacitating effect of this most 
serious handicap to success seems in this case to have 
been met by an indomitable will ; and it is an open 
question how far the advice, " Go thou and do like- 
wise," may really be offered to those of like condition. 
It seems to make surprising differences in the inter- 
ference with normal life which this dread disorder 
induces, whether it attacks one group of activities or 
emotions, or another. But there can be no doubt that 
the most courageous persons are the neurasthenics, 
who accomplish all their ordinary tasks in spite of 
the terrific, if irrational, fear which obsesses them. 
It is indeed a notable document that is recorded in 
this unusual autobiography. Here and there are 
inconsistencies, both of statement, of attitude, and of 
grammar ; but on the whole the account rings true, 
even though disguised in the interests of anonymity. 
Its reading may be recommended as a consolation 
to nervous invalids, and as a warning to those who 
by temperament are likely to become so. 

A book for ^ n tne P re f ace *° his work on " Sailing

sailing craft. Chatterton states that his history has 
been written "primarily for the general reader." 
Yet the sort of general reader he has in mind surely 
has sea-legs under him and a weather-eye suffi- 
ciently peeled to distinguish a " butter-rigged " top- 
sail schooner in the offing from one whose to'gallant 
sail is not set flying, or a genuine barque from the 
" jackass " variety. To understand Mr. Chatterton's 
book, the reader must be a real sailor-man, who 
knows what brails and braces are, as well as the 
difference between a to'gallant yard and a stun'sail

boom, — no mere fore-and-aft fresh-water man, but 
a genuine sea-dog such as has become a rarity even 
in the navy. Fancy the sympathy and horror of a 
land-lubber upon reading that " running with her 
bonnet off, she gripes badly." He might fancy that 
Mr. Chatterton referred to some poor old lady with 
the colly-wobbles, instead of a Norfolk wherry labor- 
ing with shortened sail in a gale of wind. Decidedly, 
then, Mr. Chatterton's volume is not for the " gen- 
eral reader," but for him who loves salt water — for 
the sport-loving sailor, in fact, who believes that the 
sailing ship bears the same superiority over the mere 
steamer that the horse does over the automobile. 
To such a reader it will be heartily welcome, for it 
traces succinctly — and clearly, if one understands 
sailor's talk — the history of the sailing ship from 
the first Egyptian craft of which we have knowledge 
down to the time when a Gloucester boat left the 
ways so gracefully that a bystander, exclaiming 
" See how she scoons ! " added the word " schooner " 
to the language; aye, even to the day of the racing 
machines that defend the America's cup. It is just 
the sort of book to have for handy reference on 
board the yacht when one sits on deck in the gloam- 
ing of the second dog-watch smoking a pipe and 
arguing with a nautical friend. It is a book, too, 
for the marine artist, its one hundred and thirty 
illustrations being technically correct ; in a word, a 
ready means to prevent the sad mistakes that mar 
the average marine-drawing for the sailor-man's eye. 
Though not a work for the land-lubber, it should find 
a place on the book-shelf of every true lover of sail- 
ing craft. 

_ .. - What must strike one in reading Mr. 

Literature and 6 . 

advertising in Lawrence Lewis s " The Advertise- 
" The Spectator-." men tsof The Spectator" (Houghton) 
is the comparatively slight difference between the 
advertisements of the present day and those of the 
days of Steele. We, of course, advertise more ex- 
tensively and much more aggressively ; we go out 
into the highways and hedges and compel the buyer 
to come into our shops. But the advertisers in " The 
Spectator " were none the less assured of the supe- 
riority of their goods to all others, as witness : " The 
most acute and violent Tooth-ache instantly cured, 
by a liquid remedy prepared without Mercury." 
The accompanying pictures of the dismal persons 
cured were reserved for our long-suffering age. 
Fraudulent schemes now exploited in the Sunday 
issues of our papers of negligible morals were given 
the dignity of insertion in the highly moral '• Spec- 
tator." Addison and Steele condemned in their arti- 
cles what as "practical men" they approved of in 
their advertising columns. When the " ads " fell off 
as a consequence of the tax, the paper ultimately 
died from non-support. That even the " agony 
column" is not a modern invention for the relief 
of distressed lovers, the following bears witness: 
"Florinda, the letter, you was desirous to know, 
was received." The news " ad " too was not un- 
known. Thus it seems likely that Addison's seven- 



teen critiques on " Paradise Lost " were written 
" with the ulterior motive of promoting the sale of 
Tonson's edition of Milton's epic." In like manner 
we find Addison making all manner of fun of Italian 
opera till the management " came down " with some 
paying advertisements, when a most complimentary 
notice appeared. All this is strangely familiar, but 
we had believed better things of " The Spectator." 
The book has an interesting selection of specimen 
advertisements, and through these it throws very 
valuable light on the times, as well as on some lit- 
erary questions that had not before been satisfac- 
torily answered. 

rr , ., The sad death of General Gordon 

The peaceful 

conquest of and the subsequent defeat and dis- 

the Soudan. persal of the Mahdi's forces are 
matters of history unsurpassed in the annals of the 
English expansion in Africa for tragic interest. 
To-day, amid the tropic heat and dust of Khartoum, 
another conquest is going steadily on, not by cannon 
and sword, but by the patient, unobserved, unap- 
plauded and largely unnoticed efforts of a group of 
investigators and physicians in the scientific depart- 
ments of Gordon Memorial College of Khartoum. 
The third " Annual Report " of the Wellcome Re- 
search laboratories of this institution gives a glimpse 
of the lines of investigation, fraught with unknown 
and perhaps untold consequences to the future of 
this land and the teeming population of the Upper 
Nile regions ; for they are all designed to increase 
man's knowledge and mastery of that tropical envi- 
ronment. The Report contains investigations on 
the diseases of men and of animals due to parasites, 
including observations on the protozoan, the cause 
of the much dreaded " sleeping sickness " of man 
and of allied diseases in lower animals ; on poisonous 
serpents ; on the native medical customs and super- 
stitions, and the healing art as practised by the 
dervishes ; on the insects injurious to fruits, crops, 
and goods, in storage or transit ; and anthropological 
investigations on the native and sometimes still- 
savage tribes. No outpost of modern civilization 
contends with forces of nature and savagery so 
malign in character, so entrenched by the process 
of evolution, by custom and by inheritance, as this 
English colony at Khartoum. The Report, quite 
aside from its scientific value, is an interesting 
human document, recording the first steps in this 
second, and, let us hope, permanent and peaceful 
conquest of the Soudan for modern civilization. 

Stage settings Much has recency been done toward 
in the time of the determination of the stage condi- 
Shakespeare. ditions under which Shakespeare's 
plays were presented to their first audiences, as well in 
special monographs like Brodmeier's and Reynolds's 
as in the more general works of Schelling and Baker. 
It is well to know that the Shakespearian stage is 
not a mere matter of curtains, which itinerant 
dramatic companies can foist upon the public at a 
convenient cost to themselves. The latest treatise 



58 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16 y 



upon this subject is Dr. Victor E. Albright's "The 
Elizabethan Stage " (Macmillan), which appears 
with the imprimatur of Columbia University. A 
study is made of the rude staging of the old miracle 
plays, the interludes, and the moralities, so as to 
trace the development of the stage to Shakespeare ; 
and a corresponding study is made of the Restora- 
tion stage so as to carry back what is evidently a 
survival from the time of Shakespeare. In this 
way a determination of the actual stage of Shake- 
speare's time is made from both ends. The con- 
clusion arrived at is that " the typical Shakespearian 
stage contained the following parts : an outer and 
an inner stage separated by a curtain, two proscen- 
ium doors, a gallery closed by a curtain, two balcony 
windows, and a ' hut.' " There was, of course, no 
curtain of any kind in front, nor was the curtain at 
the back painted ; consequently there was no " per- 
spective in scenes " such as came in with D'Avenant 
at the Restoration. The stage was therefore not a 
part of indefinite space, as with us, but a mere room 
or enclosure. There were very few properties, only 
enough to indicate the character of the scene. 
Everything was arranged for the presentation of 
the play with as little loss of time as possible. The 
audience was of imagination all compact, and did not 
need the elaborate background of a modern theatri- 
cal production. 

A sound mind An extremely interesting group of 
with the aid of essays by ten distinguished physi- 
cs sound body. c i ans ig published under the just now 
popular title of " Psychotherapeutics " (Richard 
Badger). They form the addresses given at New 
Haven, in May of this year, at a meeting of the 
American Therapeutic Society, devoted wholly to 
this topic. These essays will appeal to the physi- 
cian who has no special acquaintance with nervous 
disorders, and equally to the layman who has. They 
cover a variety of aspects of this question, such as 
the value of hypnotic suggestion, the treatment of 
fatigue states by mental means, the methods of 
analysis (which amount to a special psychological 
technique), the application of similar measures to 
prevent disaster in childhood, the relation of char- 
acter to psychotherapy, and the several medical and 
psychological purposes underlying this form of pro- 
ducing a sound mind with the aid of a sound body. 
The general impression of this symposium is at once 
to enforce a caution against the shallow or hasty use 
of psychotherapeutics, and equally a very encour- 
aging endorsement of its value when applied with 
the expertness and technique indispensable to every 
art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Henry Frowde publishes an " Oxford edition " 
of the " Poems of Robert Southey " in two forms, one 
being somewhat higher-priced than the other. Mr. 
Maurice H. Fitzgerald has edited this work, which will 
be very welcome as a compact representation of a poet 
who gets something less of attention from modern 



readers than is his dae. It includes the four epics, 
" Thalaba," " The Curse of Kehama," " Roderick," and 
" Madoc," besides a large selection from the rest of 
Southey's poetical writings. We may say quantum 
satis, on the whole, despite our usual objection to editions 
that are less than complete. 

Miss Mary B. Ehrmann is the composer of two col- 
lections of songs for young people, " The Child's Song 
Treasury " and " The Child's Song Garden," both pub- 
lished by Messrs. H. W. Willis & Co. Her selection of 
texts for musical setting is excellent, nearly all of the 
poems having some value as literature, and particularly 
as literature within the reach of a child's appreciation. 
Both melodies and accompaniments are simple and 
graceful. 

M The Englishman in Italy " is a very charming little 
book published by Mr. Henry Frowde. It is edited by 
Mr. George Hyde Wollaston, and quite adequately de- 
scribed upon its title-page as " a collection of verses 
written by some of those who have loved Italy." Most 
of the familiar pieces are here, and some less familiar, 
but richly deserving of acquaintance, drawn from the 
writings of such men as Symonds, Dobell, Trench, Mil- 
man, and Hare. There is a good equipment of notes 
and indexes. 

The first thing to be noted about " Terry's Mexico," 
a guide-book to our sister republic by Mr. T. Philip 
Terry, is the marvellous exactitude with which it imi- 
tates the familiar Baedeker manuals. In every mechani- 
cal respect, binding, typography, and engraving of maps 
and plans, it looks as if it might have come straight 
from the Leipzig establishment. But as a matter of 
fact, it is a product of the Riverside Press, and, although 
it is ostensibly published in the City of Mexico, the 
Houghton Mifflin Co. are its agents in this country. 
The text also, in arrangement and selection of material, 
follows the Baedeker example (and there is no better) 
so closely that nothing is left to be desired. It is a 
book that is calculated to fill anyone possessed of the 
traveller's instinct with a wild desire to pack up and set 
off at once in search of the multitudinously interesting 
places and objects described in its pages and to be traced 
in its alluring maps. 

Nothing in book form could well be more appealing 
to genuine book-lovers than the reprints that come to us 
from the Oxford Clarendon Press (Henry Frowde). Just 
now we have a group of volumes of exceptional interest. 
The stately edition of Spenser, edited by Mr. J. C. Smith, 
is completed by publication of " The Faerie Queene," in 
two volumes. Mr. S. P. Vivian has edited, for publica- 
tion in similar form, the volume of " Campion's Works," 
which includes the Latin poems and prose treatises along 
with the lovely lyrics. In smaller but quite charming 
form, we have the " Select Poems of Winthrop Mack- 
worth Praed," edited by Mr. A. D. Godley; "Shelley's 
Literary and Philosophical Criticism," edited by Mr. 
John Shaweroes; Lowell's "Fireside Travels," edited 
by Mr. E. V. Lucas ; " A Hundred Verses from Old 
Japan," being a translation by Mr. William N. Porter 
of the " Hyaka-nin-isshiu " (with the original text and 
native illustrations) ; Sir William Temple's " Essays on 
Ancient and Modern Learning and on Poetry," edited by 
Professor J. E. Spingarn ; the poems of Keats, edited by 
Mr. M. Robertson from the edition of 1820; and (in the 
" Tudor and Stuart Library ") Browne's " Religio 
Medici " with Kenelm Henry Uigby's " Observations " 
upon it.

Notes. 



It is announced that Mrs. Josephine Daskam Bacon 
is the author of " Margarita's Soul," a popular novel 
published anonymously two or three months ago. 

The monumental work on " Social England," edited 
by the late H. D. Traill and Dr. J. S. Mann, is to be 
reissued soon by Messrs. Putnam in an enlarged and 
revised edition, to occupy twelve volumes. . 

The Teachers' College of Columbia University send 
us a brief monograph on " Later Roman Education in 
Ausonius, Capella, and the Theodosian Code," pre- 
pared, with translations and commentary, by Dr. Per- 
cival R. Cole. 

" The Centenary of Tennyson," a lecture given in the 
Sheldoniau Theatre by the Vice-Chancellor of the 
University, is Oxford's contribution to the recent com- 
memoration of the great poet. It is published in pam- 
phlet form by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

The H. W. Wilson Co., Minneapolis, publish a volume 
of " Selected Articles on the Commission Plan of Munici- 
pal Government," compiled by Mr. E. Clyde Robbins, 
and forming an issue in the " Debaters' Handbook 
Series " for the use of college debating teams. 

" The Elements of Agriculture," a treatise by Pro- 
fessor G. F. Warren, is a text-book for high schools and 
colleges, published by the Macmillan Co. In its fitness 
for use in the high schools it has no competitor among 
modern texts, and in that respect supplies a long-felt 
want. 

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1909 has been 
awarded to Professor Wilhelm Ostwald of Leipzig. 
Professor Ostwald's works have included a number of 
text-books, the most recent of which is " An Elementary 
Text-Book in Modern Chemistry " (Ginn & Co). 

In a new series of handbooks called " A History of 
the Sciences," the Messrs. Putnam publish the " History 
of Chemistry," in two volumes, by Sir Edward Thorpe, 
and the " History of Astronomy," by Professor George 
Forbes. These little books are interestingly written 
and illustrated. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. will inaugurate their 
books of 1910 for general readers with two related to 
the drama, — " Elizabethan People " by Professor 
Heury Thew Stephenson of Indiana University, and 
M Allison's Lad and Other Martial Interludes " by Miss 
Beulah Marie Dix, both of which they hope to issue 
early in February. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a " Text-Book of 
Hydraulics," by Professor George E. Russell. It is a 
work for classroom use in the more advanced schools 
of technology. From the same publishers we have a 
" History of the Human Body," an advanced text-book 
of human anatomy and physiology by Professor Harris 
Hawthorne Wilder. 

It was not so many years ago that Mendele'eff's law 
was dismissed with a scant page or so in the average 
text-book of chemistry. It has since gained recogni- 
tion as the fundamental principle of the science, a fact 
now attested by the appearance of " The Periodic Law," 
by Mr. A. E. Garrett, as a volume of the " International 
Scientific Series," published by Messrs. D. Appleton 
&Co. 

The Schwenkfelder revival is in full swing in Pennsyl- 
vania. We mentioned some months ago the inaugura- 
tion of the huge publishing enterprise of the " Corpus 



Schwenckfeldianorum," and now we have as a contribu- 
tion to the " Americana Germanica " series a monograph 
on " Schwenkfelder Hymnology and the Sources of the 
First Schwenkfelder Hymn-Book Printed in America," 
by Dr. Allen Anders Seipt The book has several in- 
teresting illustrations in the form of photographs and 
facsimiles. 

It is a matter of pleasing interest to The Dial, and 
perhaps to its readers, to note the number of contribu- 
tors to its pages who have become presidents of various 
learned societies that have lately held their annual 
gatherings. Among them are Dr. D. S. Jordan, Presi- 
dent of the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science ; Prof. F. J. Turner, President of the 
American Historical Association ; Prof. Paul Shorey, 
President of the American Philological Association ; 
Prof. F. W. Kelsey, President of the American Archae- 
ological Institute ; Mr. Irving K. Pond, President of the 
Institute of American Architects. And the list is by no 
means complete. 

Mr. Bryce's great work on " The American Common- 
wealth," published over twenty years ago, is regarded 
by its distinguished author as out of date. After running 
through numerous more or less revised editions, the work 
now undergoes a thorough overhauling at Mr. Bryce's 
hands, and so radical are the changes and additions sug- 
gested to him by his later familiarity with the American 
people and American institutions, that entirely new plates 
will be called for in the proposed new issue of the book. 
The last two decades have been fruitful in events and de- 
velopments of national significance, and Mr. Bryce's com- 
mentary on them will be well worth reading. Already 
the curious fact has been noted that the best exposition 
of our system of government is from an Englishman's 
pen, while the ablest treatise on the English Constitu- 
tion is the work of an American, our new President of 
Harvard. 

The fiftieth anniversary of the " Cornhill Magazine " 
is celebrated this month by the issue of a " Jubilee 
Xumber," to which Lady Ritchie, Mr. A. C. Benson, 
Dr. W. H. Fitchett and others contribute special articles. 
It is cause for congratulation that while so many high- 
class English monthlies, like " Macmillan's Magazine," 
" Murray's Magazine," " Longman's Magazine," and 
" Temple Bar," have been pushed to the wall, this excel- 
lent literary periodical has rounded out its half-century 
of honorable existence. Edited first by Thackeray, 
and later by Leslie Stephen and by James Payn, it has 
always maintained a high standard, and has given to the 
world, in serial form, the works of many of the great 
novelists of its time — even as it is now producing the 
latest of Mrs. Humphry Ward's stories. With the old 
and reliable " Blackwood's," it stands in eloquent pro- 
test against the deluge of sixpenny popular monthlies 
now flooding the hind. 

The Trustees of Columbia University announce that 
they have arranged to publish through the Columbia 
University Press a complete edition of the works of 
John Milton, in verse and in prose, in English and in 
Latin. The editorial supervision of the work has been 
accepted by William P. Trent, LL.D., Professor of 
English Literature in Barnard College, Columbia Uni- 
versity. Professor Trent has already published a study 
of Milton, and is now completing a biography and bibli- 
ography of Daniel Defoe, which is to be issued shortly 
in three volumes by the Columbia University Press. 
For his difficult task Professor Trent is qualified by life-

" The portrait [Abraham Lincoln] is an admirable one, and the etch-

rugged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the 
deep lines of care that furrow the brow are significant of the period of

"Mr. JACQUES REICH, 1 Madison Ave., N. Y. 

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham 
Lincoln, when I took it to be framed for the President, and it is the best 
likeness of him. ... I am the only living body guard of Abraham 
Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to me today, as when he was living. I would love so much to 
have one of those etchings if you will kindly tell me how I can get one.

The story of an international marriage, strikingly different from the

not touched, why the Duke disappeared periodically, and just what 
Estelle de Maurienval had to do with it, are a few of the many sur-

A REMARKABLE VOLUME 

THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE By Eleanor Harris Rowland 

PROFESSOR PALMER, author of " The Life of Alice Freeman Palmer," says : 

" Formerly most of the superstitions of the day sprang from religion. In our time they are more apt to come from cheap 
science and often succeed in terrorizing the religious mind. Such terrors Dr. E. H. Rowland in her little book, ' The 
Right to Believe,' has done much to remove. Her elaborate scientific and philosophic training, her brilliant style, 
candor, and devoutness, should make her a veritable friend of the spirit wherever there are perplexed souls. It would 
not be easy to point to another religious book where so much good sense is packed into so brief a compass." 

WILLIAM JAMES, author of "Human Immortality," says: 

" I have just read with great interest and satisfaction your little book. The style is animated and quick, the 
illustrations clarifying, and the argument wonderfully well articulated. ... It is a fine and brilliant performance."

OPEN COURT PUBLICATIONS 
ON SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY 

FOUR IMPORTANT BOOKS BY HUGO DE VRIES 
The Mutation Theory 

(Two volumes) 

Experiments and Observations on the Origin of Species in the Vegetable Kingdom 

VOLUME I. NOW READY VOLUME II. IN PRESS 

Translators : Professor J. B. Farmer and A. D. Darbishire 

VOLUME I. 

Origin of Species by Mutation 

582 pp. 114 illustrations. Six colored plates (lithographs). Bibliography and index. 
Price, $4.00 per volume net (18s.). 
A knowledge of the laws of mutation must sooner or later lead to the possibility of inducing mutations 
at will and so of originating perfectly new characters in animals and plants. And just as the process of 
selection has enabled us to produce improved races, greater in value and in beauty, so a control of the mutative 
process will, it is hoped, place in our hands the power of originating permanently improved species of animals 
and plants. 

Intracellular Pangenesis 

(In press.) 300 pp. Cloth, $3.00. 

An investigation of the physiology of heredity, especially the facts of variation and of atavism. A critical 
survey of previous theories of heredity from the standpoint of observation of physiological cell-life is followed 
by a summary of the hypothesis of pangenesis. 

The third part of the book consists of a chapter on Fertilization and Hybridization. 

The whole science of vital phenomena is contained in what DeVries calls the Pangen, a special hereditary 
character, which may be made the object of experimental treatment in animals as well as in plants. It is a 
most attractive theory, and the book is so truly scientific in its simple language and reverential spirit as to be 
easily read and understood by the layman in science as well as the scholar; and the preacher as well as the 
plant breeder will find in it many fine inspirations. 

Species and Varieties : Their Origin by Mutation 

Second Edition, thoroughly Corrected and Revised, with Portrait. 
Price, postpaid, $5.00 (21s.) net. xxiii + 830 pages. 8vo, cloth, gilt top. 
The contents of this book include a readable and orderly recital of the facts and details which furnish the 
basis for the mutation-theory of the origin of species. All of the more important phases of heredity and descent 
come in for a clarifying treatment that renders the volume extremely readable to the amateur as well as to the 
trained biologist. The more reliable historical data are cited, and the results obtained by Professor de Vries 
in the Botanical Garden at Amsterdam during twenty years of observations are described. 

Plant Breeding 

Comments on the Experiments of Nilsson and Burbank 

A scientific book in simple language. Intensely interesting as well as instructive. 

Of special value to every botanist, horticulturist, and farmer.

1910] THE DIAL, n 



PUBLISHER'S NOTE 

THE OPEN COURT PUBLISHING COMPANY was founded in 1887 
by Mr. E. C. Hegeler, of La Salle, 111., for the purpose of establishing 
ethics and religion upon a scientific basis. It has formulated its aims differently 
at different times, but has always adhered to the same ideal of working out a 
religious reformation through the light that science affords. Without animosity 
to any of the established creeds of the world, it stands for conservative progress 
based upon the most radical thought and fearless investigation. 

The primary means adopted by The Open Court for the promotion 
of its principles, is the publication of standard classical literature, and of original 
books by competent writers. 

The secondary means is the publication of two periodicals, entitled 
The Monist, a quarterly magazine devoted to the philosophy of science, and 
The Open Court, an illustrated monthly, devoted to the science of religion, the 
religion of science, and the extension of the Religious Parliament idea. 

The 1909 volume of The Monist just completed, contains, among other 
important contributions, the following : 

Professor DAVID EUGENE SMITH, Teacher's College, Columbia University, N.Y. 
A commentary on Heiberg's newly-discovered Treatise by Archimedes. 

Dr. RICHARD VON GARBE, University of Tubingen, Germany. 

Akbar, Emperor of India. A picture of life and customs in India of the 17th century. 

Professor JAMES H. LEUBA, Bryn Mawr College, Pa. 
Psychological Origin of Religion. 

Professor BASIL C. H. HARVEY, University of Chicago. 
The Nature of Vital Processes. 

Professor C. H. CORNILL, University of Breslau, Germany. 
Music in the Old Testament. 

Professor ALBERT SCHINZ, Bryn Mawr College, Pa. 
Jean Jacques Rousseau : A Forerunner of Pragmatism. 

Professor WILLIAM B. SMITH, Tulane University, Louisiana. 
The Pre-Christian Jesus. 

Professor CHARLES STUART GAGER, University of Missouri. 
Hugo De Vries' Theory of Fertilization and Hybridization. 

Professor HENRY POINCARE, University of Paris, School of Polytechnique. 
The Choice of Facts. 

EDITORIALS : Construction of the Straight Line. James on Pluralism and Religion. 
Philosophy of the Personal Equation. Psychology a Domain of its Own. 
A Study in Abnormal Psychology. 

Complete files of The Open Court and The Monist are obtainable at most 
public libraries in large cities. A limited number of complete files are still on 
sale, and single copies of back numbers may be obtained upon request.

How to know the stars without scientific knowledge is 
what this book tells — what their names are. why they 
have different colors, how they change their positions in 
the skies — all the signs that we observe each night and 
know so little about are here explained with great charm. 
No preliminary study is necessary.

BY THE SAME AUTHOR 

Astronomy with the Naked Eye 

At last here is a little book on astronomy for us who want 
to know just the plain things about the stars. No tele- 
scopes, no special knowledge required — and it reads like 
a novel — only better. The plan of the book is to enable 
the casual observer of the night skies to appreciate the 
scheme of the constellations.

Side-Lights on Astronomy 

By SIMON NEWCOMB 

How large is the universe? How long will it endure? 
What becomes of the sun's energy radiated into space? 
These and kindred questions Professor Newcomb discusses 
in the light of the most recent knowledge. The work has 
to do with the larger aspects of astronomy.

IMPORTANT BOOKS FOR LIBRARIES 



Modern Constitutions By Walter Fairleigh Dodd 

This collection contains the texts, in English translation where English is not the original language, of the 
constitutions or fundamental laws of the Argentine nation, Australia. Austria- Hungary, Belgium. Brazil. Canada, Chile. 
Denmark. France. Germany, Italy. Japan. Mexico, Netherlands. Norway, Portugal. Russia, Spain. Sweden. Switzerland, 
and the United States. These constitutions have not heretofore been available in any one English collection, and a 
number of them have not before appeared in English translation. Each constitution is preceded by a brief historical 
introduction, and is followed by a select list of the most important books dealing with the government of the country 
under consideration. 2 vols.. 750 pages, 8vo, cloth ; net $5.00, postpaid $5.42. 

Source Book for Social Origins: Ethnological Materials, Psychological 
Standpoint, Classified and Annotated Bibliographies for the Interpretation of Savage 
Society. By WiLLIAM I. THOMAS 

The papers forming the body of the book are by such eminent modern anthropologists as Boas, Tyler, Wester- 
marck, Spencer and Gillen. Haddon, and Rivers. The author has an introductory chapter on the standpoint from which 
the materials are to be viewed, and critical comments are appended to each part. There are seven parts: (1) External 
Environment (.Anthropogeoeraphy and Primitive Economics i ; (2) Primitive Mind and Education; (3) Early Marriage ; 
(t) Invention and Technology; (5) Art. Ornament, and Decoration; ' 6 > Magic Religion, Ritual, and Ceremonial; 
(7) Social Organization. Morality, and the State. The Extended Bibliographies form the chief feature of the book.

The Wars of Religion in France (1559-1576): The Huguenots, 

Catherine de Medici, and Philip II. By James Westfall Thompson 

The volume, representing nearly seven years of study, including two prolonged visits to France, is based upon a 
careful examination of original sources, and contains a valuable appendix of hitherto unpublished documents from the 
archives of Paris and London. It treats of the epoch of the Reformation, but does not attempt to deal with the religious 
conflict except in so far as it influenced the political, diplomatic, and economic activities of the period. Our whole 
interpretation of the sixteenth century, of course, has been profoundly changed by the recent progress in economics : 
and in the matter of industrial history, and of the retroactive effect of wretched existing conditions, as also in the 
development of the Holy League of France out of certain political and social forces, the book makes decidedly new and 
valuable contributions. 618 pages. Svo, cloth ; illustrated, net $4.50. postpaid, $4.84. 

Primary Elections By c. Edward Merriam 

For students of American political history, and especially of American party history, this volume will be particu- 
larly valuable. It gives a clear account of the various laws and cases and a critical discussion of the present primary 
question. The absence of literature on this subject makes the appearance of the book especially timely. Many general 
readers as well as the special students will find it of interest. 300 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.25, postpaid $1.35. 

The American Newspaper By James Edward Rogers 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have 
recently been made. The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion 
being treated as one of concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections 
of the country as a means of getting acquaintance with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book 
discusses in succession the following topics: The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper; The City and the 
Newspaper ; The Nature of the American Newspaper ; The Influence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that 
Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid $1.10. 

The Armenian Awakening By Leon Arpee 

This book will be found singularly interesting and appropriate in the light of the occurrences of the past few years. 
Beginning with the " Dark Ages " of Armenian history, the author traces the religious attitude and the struggles of this 
people from the time of the introduction of Christianity. It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are familiar 
with the Armenian struggle for religious freedom, that political forces have been a strong factor in the persecution to 
which this people has been periodically subjected. All the sidelights which the condition of European politics could 
throw on the situation have been employed by the author, and his sympathetic treatment leaves the reader with a clear 
understanding of the various motives for the frequent outbreaks against the Armenians which have aroused the 
Christian world. 240 pages. 12mo. cloth ; net $1.25. postpaid $1.38.

THE LIBRARY INTERESTS OF 
CHICAGO. 



Although the large publishing houses of the 
United States have grown up, for the most part, 
in the Eastern States, Chicago has long been 
recognized as the chief distributing centre for 
American books. The Mississippi Valley, from 
the Alleghanies to the Rockies, is the great 
book-buying section of the country, and the city 
which focuses the principal lines of transporta- 
tion of this section is naturally the city to which 
it looks for supplies not of meat and grain 
alone. It is only a logical extension of this 
principle that has recently brought to Chicago 
the headquarters of the American Library Asso- 
ciation, which is now comfortably housed in 
quarters generously provided by the Public 
Library of the municipality. Chicago thus be- 
comes the centre of the activities represented by 
the profession of American librarianship ; and 
those activities, we need hardly say, are varied 
and far-reaching to an extent of which the gen- 
eral public has little idea 

The fact that Chicago is the home of four of 
the largest libraries in the country constitutes 
one of the important reasons for thus making it 
the national centre and rallying-point of the pro- 
fession. These libraries, all four of which have 
been rapidly growing in possessions and in use- 
fulness, are the John Crerar Library, the New- 
berry Library, the Chicago Public Library, and 
the University of Chicago Library. The first 
two have about a quarter of a million volumes 
each, the third upwards of a third of a million, 
and the fourth a number not far below half a 
million. Here, then, are about a million and a 
third of volumes altogether, dedicated to the 
uses of the democracy and the republic of 
scholarship. There have recently been develop- 
ments in the history of all four of these libraries 
which, while sufficiently familiar to Chicagoans, 
are of such interest to the larger public as to 
call for the brief statement that we are now 
about to make. 

The library of the University, the largest of 
the four, is to be congratulated upon the pros- 
pective erection of a long-needed building. 
Soon after the death of President Harper, plans 
were made for a library building that should 
bear his name, and that should stand as the 



76 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



imposing central structure of the campus group. 
A popular subscription was opened, in order 
that the building might be the result of many 
personal contributions, and Mr. Rockefeller 
made the liberal offer of three additional dol- 
lars for every one thus subscribed. The sum of 
eight hundred thousand dollars was fixed as the 
total to be realized, and that mark was reached 
some months ago. An adequate building is 
thus assured, and it will be erected as soon as 
possible. The University Library has thus far 
been without an official head, and its collections 
have grown in a rather haphazard way. The 
departments have done about as they pleased 
with their special appropriations, and there has 
been little coordination of effort. In fact, the 
most difficult problem that will confront the 
librarian, when he shall have been appointed, 
will be that of reconciling the departmental 
demands with the general interests of the insti- 
tution. He will have to be both diplomatic 
and masterful to bring order out of the long- 
existing chaos. This problem confronts the 
administration of every large university library, 
but we imagine that it will prove unusually 
serious in the present instance. 

The Chicago Public Library has been in the 
lime-light of local interest since the disturbance 
of last spring, marked by the abrupt dismissal 
of its faithful and efficient librarian, and all 
the miserable chicanery which attended that 
indefensible act. The fact that a highly capa- 
ble successor, in the person of Mr. Henry E. 
Legler, has been provided, places that deplor- 
able affair in the class of res judicatce, but by 
no means wipes away the reproach. The activ- 
ities of the new librarian are taking the form 
of a reorganization of the service upon a more 
professional basis than formerly obtained, a 
movement to establish branch libraries in out- 
lying sections of the city, and an extension of 
circulation through the agency of the public 
schools. The last of these activities is particu- 
larly important, and is capable of surprising 
results. The latest report upon this subject 
from New York exhibits nearly half a million 
volumes in class-room libraries and a home cir- 
culation for the year of six millions. It costs 
a great deal of money to carry out such plans, 
as well as to establish branch libraries ; and 
Chicago has not yet got the money in sight. 
As a matter of fact, these good things would 
have been done years ago had the money been 
available, and had the library trustees made 
them the object of serious effort. 

The Newberry Library, under the direction 



of Mr. W.N. C. Carleton, the recently-appointed 
head, is entering upon a promising period of 
development. This is the institution which of 
all the Big Four most distinctly stands for the 
humanities, and is therefore peculiarly inter- 
esting to the friends of liberal culture. It was 
unfortunately handicapped many years ago by 
an over-expensive building, the construction of 
which impaired very seriously the endowment, 
and the upkeep of which has kept the annual 
appropriation for books far below what it might 
have beeen under a more sagacious management. 
It has been still further handicapped by a pre- 
posterous cataloguing device and by a clas- 
sification which unduly sacrificed practical to 
theoretical considerations. Mr. Carlton has no 
slight task before him in bringing order out of 
this comparative chaos, and his energies will 
have to expend themselves upon these matters 
alone for a long time to come. 

The John Crerar Library, restricted to the 
sciences — although this term is taken in a very 
catholic sense — has been exceptionally well 
managed from the beginning, both in a business 
and a professional way. It has had but one 
librarian, Mr. Clement W. Andrews, who has 
built up both the collections and the adminis- 
trative organization to admirable effect. The 
trustees, moreover, did not make the initial mis- 
take of putting a large part of the endowment 
fund into a costly plant, but determined instead 
to occupy rented quarters until a building fund 
should have been created out of the accumula- 
tions of surplus income. The wisdom of this 
policy is now patent, for the fund is ready to be 
used, the interest-bearing capital has not been 
reduced, and the collection of books is even 
larger than could have been expected from so 
severely economical a plan. The problem now 
before this institution is that of securing a site. 
The municipality has offered public land in the 
heart of the city, fronting on Lake Michigan, 
and the library has accepted the offer. Unfor- 
tunately, there is in Chicago one obstructionist 
individual who claims a legal right to keep the 
lake front clear of buildings, and he has thus far 
been successful in thwarting the evident wishes 
of the community. The litigation is slowly 
drawing toward its end, and with that end the 
chief problem of the John Crerar Library will 
be settled one way or another. 

Taking a concluding general glance at the 
four great libraries of Chicago, we see that they 
have had many difficulties to overcome, and that 
they have sometimes suffered from acts of mis- 
taken judgment. Looking at them merely as 



1910.]

collections of books, the one outstanding fact 
about them is that, with a single exception, 
they are the result of accretion rather than of 
organic growth. What they now need is a 
closer delimitation of their spheres of activity, 
a systematic filling-up of their gaps, and an 
extension of the principle of cooperation in 
serving the community toward which they have 
a common obligation. They are now under 
such direction that we may anticipate for them 
henceforth just the sort of organic development 
that has hitherto been but imperfectly realized. 



GLEANINGS FROM THE LIBRARY 
PRESS OF 1909. 



The library profession has during the past year 
made its contribution to the gayety of the nations. 
An editorial contributor in the London " Library 
World " wrote two articles comparing American 
and European (especially English) libraries, poking 
fun at what he called "American tomfoolery," — 
the efforts to attract children through picture bulle- 
tins and Hallowe'en parties, which he compared 
with "the freaky sideshows which are to be found 
in the cabarets at Montmartre." He also tried his 
hand at the dismal science of library statistics, the 
study of which led him to the belief that American 
libraries are shining examples of " extravagant 
management and comparatively poor results," a 
belief which evidently comforted his heart, as it was 
intended by the author "to bring comfort to the 
heart of the British rate-payer by showing that, in 
comparison with his American fellow-victim, he is 
getting a valuable public service for a mere trifle," 
that is, in plain language, that British libraries have 
inadequate funds, and that British librarians are 
woefully underpaid — as they certainly must be if 
their salaries are smaller than those prevailing in 
America. The English writer adds a personal touch 
when he says that he has found American librarians 
to be " a somewhat narrow-minded, self-sufficient 
and wilfully-ignorant class of public officials," with 
emoluments large enough to enable them to feast on 
" pumpkin pie, clams, baked beans and canvas-back 
duck all the year round." These two articles, nat- 
urally, provoked several replies in American jour- 
nals, but of most of these it can be said that, if the 
Englishman used a club where the sword of a 
French duelist would have been more appropriate, 
the Americans largely missed the humor of the 
situation and made the mistake of taking a donkey 
for a bull. 

Criticism is good for the soul, but it must, to be 
effective, combine frankness with fairness and good 
nature. It was just here that the critic in the 
" Library World " failed. Of the replies which his 
article evoked, Dr. E. C. Richardson's address on 



" Book Matters at Home and Abroad," read at the 
bi-state meeting in Atlantic City in March, and 
printed in the May " Library Journal," has its 
value, both in the even-tempered and dignified 
refutation of some of the statistical vagaries of our 
English critic, and in the author's own passing 
judgment on where American librarians lead, where 
European. The progress of cooperative cataloguing, 
the development of library schools, " the intelligent 
application of libraries to social life," are pointed 
out as among the distinctive American contribu- 
tions to library progress ; while the leadership of 
Europe is acknowledged in inter-library loans and 
" in almost all the higher branches of library sci- 
ence : Bibliography, Palaeography, all the historical 
aspects, the choice and use of books for scholarly 
use, the Seminar method, etc. We have also," Dr. 
Richardson adds, "been glad to find European 
libraries pressing hard by in the development of 
the stack system, showing us ingenious practical 
devices and teaching us all sorts of excellent points 
in technique." 

The widespread interest in historical matters 
among English librarians is testified to by several 
articles in the English library press. Mr. W. R. B. 
Prideaux has an interesting paper in the April 
" Library Association Record " on " Library Econ- 
omy in the Sixteenth Century," his material being 
drawn chiefly from Conrad Gesner's " Pandecta " 
(1548), Florianus Treflerus' "Methodus" (1560), 
and Angelo Roccha's " Bibliotheca Apostolica Vati- 
cana " (159 1) . The author shows how books then were 
accessioned, catalogued, classified, shelf-listed, much 
as they are now, and says truly : " It ought to be a 
very real help in our present problems if we are able 
occasionally to place ourselves in the position of our 
predecessors and enter into their difficulties. We can 
trace what means they adopted to cope with them 
and what success attended their efforts, and before 
long we will find that their difficulties were not so 
very different from our own. I contend that his- 
torical study is one of the most practical forms of 
study and one of the richest in results." 

The Milton centenary gave Mr. A. W. Pollard the 
text for the introductory article in the January issue 
of "The Library," — "The Bibliography of John 
Milton." This article is a model of bibliographical 
biography, in which the very title-pages, as it were, 
are put in their proper place in the story of the au- 
thor's life. 

Mr. Pollard has also contributed, during the past 
two years, several articles, of interest to bibliog- 
rapher and bookman, to " The Printing Art." In 
one of these papers, on "The Ending of Books," he 
makes a plea for a return to the habit of the early 
printers to reserve a rather conspicuous place at the 
end of a book for their name and place of printing. 
" A printer," Mr. Pollard says, " has right to an ade- 
quate recognition of the good work which he puts 
into a book, and this recognition naturally takes a 
form which gives a decorative finish to the end of

a volume, instead of allowing it, as is the case with 
so many modern books, to stumble along at hap- 
hazard to an humble conclusion." 

In three articles in the April, June, and October 
numbers of ''The Library," entitled "The So-called 
Gutenberg Documents," Mr. J. H. Hessels retraces 
the paths of his earlier writing, adding little or 
nothing that is new. His new investigations leave 
the question of the invention of printing exactly 
where it was before. It is reasonably well proved, 
though Mr. Hessels does not admit it, that in the 
year 1439 Gutenberg was engaged, among other 
undertakings in metal work, on something that 
looks suspiciously like printing ; we have document- 
ary evidence that he was engaged in printing a very 
large book for some years between 1450 and 1455 
(or 1453), and we have typological evidence that 
before 1450 — how long we do not know — some- 
one in Mainz (and there was no other printer in 
Mainz at that time than Gutenberg) had been printing 
a number of broadsides and pamphlets. Of print- 
ing with movable type as practiced by Gutenberg, 
"Dutch Donatuses," accordingto the Cologne Chroni- 
cle of 1499, were a " prefiguration," whatever that 
may mean. Of Gutenberg we know enough to satisfy 
us beyond doubt, that he lived and practiced print- 
ing in Mainz about the middle of the fifteenth cen- 
tury. About Coster, or whoever else printed the 
" Dutch Donatuses," we know nothing, not even 
when he lived, or when the books ascribed to him 
were printed. But to enter fully into this contro- 
versy would carry us too far. 

Mr. Louis N. Wilson, the librarian of Clark Uni- 
versity, published in the May number of "Public 
Libraries," under the title " Common Sense in Li- 
braries," the result of an enqiiete among two thou- 
sand university men, journalists, school teachers, 
and other users of libraries in various parts of the 
country, by which he tried to find out what those who 
use libraries think of them, and what improvements 
have suggested themselves to library users. Not 
less than 1743 answers were returned, a remarkable 
evidence of the interest with which libraries are 
regarded among those for whom they exist. The 
criticisms centred round four points : Too much art 
at the cost of adaptability in the buildings, too little 
light and ventilation in the public rooms, too many 
restrictions, and too much patronizing. The restric- 
tions against admission to the shelves are those that 
are most often and most earnestly complained of. 
And the two-card system, by which only one work 
of fiction may be taken out at a time, is also dis- 
paraged, and seems to be looked upon as an item 
of patronizing, though there are sufficient adminis- 
trative reasons to justify that rule. The fiction 
problem itself is taken by the horns by one of Mr. 
Wilson's correspondents in the following fashion: 
"If people want novels, let them have them — the 
good ones — and do not worry about it. Is there any 
earthly objection to the reading of standard novels ? 
As to the unwholesome ones, do not buy them." 



" The Librarian's Future " is discussed by Mr. 
C. K. Bolton in the January " Library Journal." 
He compares the profession of librarianship with 
those of the law and medicine, and finds that, in 
matters of a broad outlook upon life, a wide-awake 
interest in the world that surrounds them, librarians 
lag behind. But there is comfort in sight : " Leaders 
in all work are men who do more than earn a liveli- 
hood. Are we," Mr. Bolton asks, " to reach this 
standard? If so, two courses seem just now open 
to us, the old way of scholarship, the new way of 
sociological interest. The old way has a few adher- 
ents among our American librarians. The new way 
— the civic spirit — claims a greater number of 

earnest followers." « « *

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A POISON-LABEL FOR TREACHEROUS LITERATURE, 

proposed by Librarian Lummis of the Los Angeles 
Public Library, and already commented on by us, 
has now been before the library world (as a sugges- 
tion, that is) for some months. In his current 
Annual Report, Mr. Lummis devotes ten pages to 
this question of warning the reader not to repose con- 
fidence in untrustworthy books, giving a summary of 
answers received from other librarians to a question- 
naire extensively circulated by him. As an illus- 
tration of Mr. Lummis's striking and original way 
of putting things, let us quote his remarks on the 
value of critical comments printed in a catalogue 
rather than conspicuously displayed on the books 
themselves. " But the vital thing is," he says, " that 
these druggists do not put their poison label in the 
right place. It is like placing it, not on the bottle, 
but in the druggist's prescription-book at the drug- 
store. There are, doubtless, Methodic Citizens, who, 
if seized with an internal disturbance at 2 o'clock, 
a. m., would prefer to run down town to the drug- 
store and waken the druggist to consult his book as 
to whether the bottle labelled < R. 932 : 361 ' is 
paregoric, glycerine, Mother Winslow's, Lydia Pink- 
ham, carbolic acid, strychnine, or what. The average 
mere human prefers the skull-and-crossbones on the 
bottle itself, along with the name of the dose." The 
one objection to this labelling scheme, as brought out 
by the canvass of librarians, is its insufficient practi- 
cability, especially for libraries of less than the am- 
plest resources. Few libraries can maintain a corps 
of experts, in all departments of literature, to see that 
each book, as it is placed on the shelf, is labelled 
with nice regard to its excellences and defects. But 
Mr. Lummis is pushing ahead, and has obtained his 
directors' approval of five simple forms of label for 
the guidance of his readers. His purpose he declares 
to be " not censorship, nor any other partisan proced- 
ure, but rather a sort of ' Glorified Cross-Reference,' 
to be employed with the same tact which is necessary 
in all other functions of a public library." Within

ten years, he predicts, this suggestion of his will he 
bearing fruit in every respectable library in America. 
Let it be understood, finally, that the plan seems 
not to include fiction. " Bad novels do no great 
harm — particularly if you don't have them. The 
people who abuse their mind with trash are predes- 
tined, anyhow." . . . 

Reminiscences evoked by the Lew Wallace 
memorial, the statue of the late General placed a 
few weeks ago in Statuary Hall at Washington by 
the State of Indiana, are now current, and form a 
valuable appendix to the Autobiography which the 
author of " Ben-Hur " gave to the world about 
three years ago. From a letter written by him at 
Constantinople in 1885 the following passage is of 
interest : " We may as well regard the curtain rung 
down on this act of life. I have tried many things 
in the course of the drama — the law, soldiering, 
politics, authorship, and, lastly, diplomacy — and if 
I may pass judgment on the success achieved in 
each, it seems now that when I sit down finally in 
the old man's gown and slippers, helping the cat to 
keep the fireplace warm, I shall look back upon 
' Ben-Hur ' as my best performance, and this mission 
near the Sultan as the next best." Mr. Meredith 
Nicholson's eloquent tribute to his friend contained 
many noteworthy passages ; for example : " His gift 
of concentration was very unusual. He could write 
on his knee on a railway train, or in an office beset 
by callers, and never be disturbed. During the years 
between his return from Turkey and his death, I had 
many opportunities for observing him in various 
circumstances, and I never saw any lapse from that 
grave and beautiful courtesy which marked him." 
There was something oriental, probably in part ac- 
quired in the East, in his unruffled calm and perfect 
self-control. Concerning the genesis of " Ben-Hur," 
Mr. Nicholson says it was a chance conversation 
with Colonel Ingersoll on a railway train that sent 
Wallace home to pursue those studies which finally 
bore fruit in the romance whose success, after two 
years of only moderate sales, became enormous. No 
other novel, protected by copyright, has equalled the 
commercial success of u Ben-Hur." 

The indignity of the imperfect period is one 
to be protested against by all readers, and especially 
by those who pursue the pleasant practice of reading 
aloud and rather pride themselves on their skill in 
that now decadent ai't. Eccentric punctuation is 
one of the cheap devices easily within the reach of 
the striver after novelty, and not a few there are 
in the world of letters who avail themselves of it. 
Even so gifted a writer as Mr. William De Morgan 
repeatedly grieves his admirers by erratic syntax 
and an improper use of the full stop. Opening 
" Alice- for-Short " at random, one finds the fol- 
lowing : " In days when a Gretna Green elopement 
from London meant four days' posting, day and night, 
through pastoral silences that are now resonant with 
pumping-engines ; under skies then clear that now 



are tainted with a Cimmerian gloom, or blacked 
outright like Hell — through villages that have be- 
come railway-stations and village-inns that have 
become Hotels, with lifts." In the mould and form 
of a well-rounded period the author has palmed off 
on us a mere fragment of a period. Reading it 
aloud, one comes plump upon the full stop with 
somewhat the same kind of shock as is given to the 
unwary person descending a flight of stairs in the 
dark and reaching the bottom when he thinks there 
is still one stair left. Mrs. St. Leger Harrison's 
" Sir Richard Calmady " is another book that in- 
dulges in this sort of eccentricity. Her clauses 
calling only for commas between them are often sep- 
arated by periods, making them verbless sentences 
— things abhorred by all right-minded persons. 
For reading aloud, such authors are a vexation 
and a torment. Let them go to school awhile to 
Macaulay and Johnson and Addison, and learn a 
proper respect for the laws and conventions govern- 
ing the construction of sentences. 

Some reminiscences of the first editor of 
" Punch " have recently been going the rounds of 
the press, in connection with the famous humorist's 
centenary ; for Mark Lemon followed the example 
of Tennyson, Lincoln, FitzGerald, and other cele- 
brities, in choosing 1809 for his birth-year. It was 
Lemon's rather peculiar and suggestive name that 
finally determined the choice of a title for the pro- 
jected paper. " The Funny Dog " had been all but 
decided upon, when one of the group of artists and 
authors interested in the new journal spoke of it 
as resembling a good brew of punch, in that it 
was nothing without a Lemon. Thereupon Henry 
Mayhew, the proprietor of the paper, caught at the 
suggestion and exclaimed : " A capital idea ! We'll 
call it 'Punch'!" So humble were its first begin- 
nings that Lemon's salary was no more than thirty 
shillings a week. Yet so truly did he discern the 
possibilities of the new weekly, and so effectively 
did he bend all his energies toward realizing those 
possibilities, that eventually he enjoyed an editorial 
income of fifteen hundred pounds a year. The 
story of Lemon's brilliant achievements and of the 
remarkable success he made of " Punch " — a suc- 
cess that is wont to seem somewhat incredible to 
readers on this side of the Atlantic — is an interesting 
one. And all this carries one back sixty-nine years 
to the birth-year of u Punch " in 1841, while its 
genial and tactful first editor has been dead nearly 
forty years. 

A Sisyphus task for library trustees is that 
which has for seven weary years been unsuccess- 
fully attempted in Washington. The District of 
Columbia Public Library is in urgent need of 
branches. Mr. Carnegie has offered $350,000, 
under the conditions usual in such cases, for the 
building of these branch libraries. For seven years 
attempts have been made to secure Congressional 
action favorable to the acceptance of at least enough 



80 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



to erect a branch at Tacoma Park, where the resi- 
dents have offered to provide a suitable site ; but 
again and again the hope of success has been dis- 
appointed on the very eve of its expected realiza- 
tion, and the stone pushed almost to the top of the 
hill has gone rolling back again to the bottom. 
What interest has a billion-dollar Congress in a petty 
thirty-thousand-dollar library bill? There are no 
plums in that pudding for any constituency, no 
voters on the watch to punish a representative for 
lack of zeal. If one could any longer feel surprise 
at anything done or left undone by our national 
law-makers, it would be amazing to witness this 
indifferent attitude toward a most handsome offer 
to provide our capital city with needed library 
buildings. . . . 

The courteous and tactful librarian is he 
(or more often she) who can so sweetly and convin- 
cingly recommend a book possessed by the library, 
in place of one asked for but not at hand, that the 
applicant shall go away blessing the librarian for 
the happy substitution. " For instance," says a 
facetious speaker at a recent meeting of Massachu- 
setts librarians, "don't say you haven't Mrs. Mary 
J. Holmes's books, but rather say you haven't 
them to-day ; and add, ' But we have Mr. Holmes's 
books, and who wouldn't be interested in "Elsie 
Venner"?'" In similar manner, if Mill "On 
Liberty " is asked for at a small library not owning 
a copy, let the polite answer be : " We regret that 
the book is not available just at present, but would n't 
' Mill on the Floss ' serve your purpose equally 
well?" Or if "Miss Toosey's Mission" is desired 
when the book happens to be out, rather than give 
a blunt refusal one might (though the age and 
calling of the applicant should first be considered) 
recommend Bliss's "Encyclopaedia of Missions." 
This plan of procedure, however, needs more careful 
elaboration than it can here receive. 

Public library events in St. Louis are just 
now unusually indicative of growth and progress. 
Mr. Crunden's retirement because of illness last 
summer was cause for more than local regret. He 
had acted as librarian for nearly thirty- two years, 
and to him the present flourishing condition of the 
library is largely due. Under the new administra- 
tion — that of Mr. Arthur E. Bostwick, who assumed 
charge last October — the onward progress appears 
to continue unchecked. The latest official report 
of the library contains a view of the handsome new 
central building now under construction, with pic- 
tures of various branch buildings. A seventh branch 
is about to be built, if building has not already 
begun. Encouraging is the librarian's report that 
though the branches multiply the circulation from 
the central building remains nearly constant, showing 
that each branch calls into being a fresh patronage 
— the supply creates the demand, contrary to the 
usual rule in business. The " Annual Report " now 
before us is unusually full, covering in fact the 



two years 1907-8 and 1908-9, the issue for the 
earlier year having been omitted on account of Mr. 
Crunden's illness. 

The winter encouragement of summer 
reading is systematically undertaken by the public 
library (or Library Association, as it is officially 
styled) of Portland, Oregon. In the months of 
short days and long evenings the seeds are sown 
that germinate and bear fruit in the summer season. 
The courses in English language and literature at 
the high schools of that city partly govern the libra- 
rian in issuing lists of selected books that may profit- 
ably be read in connection with the prescribed work; 
and so ready has been the response on the part of 
students that the reading has in many instances been 
continued into the vacation. Five hundred and 
eighty-two vacation cards, the librarian informs us 
in her current Annual Report, were issued last year, 
and nearly forty-five hundred books were drawn for 
summer reading. A good record ; but one may, with- 
out offense, query how much the Oregonian summer, 
so different from the depressing season known in 
more eastern longitudes, has contributed to a result 
that would put to shame the record of many a com- 
munity possessing equally good schools and cherish- 
ing equally high standards of culture. 

The child's conservative taste in litera- 
ture has often been noted. Whereas his elders are 
fretfully eager for the latest sensation in fiction, the 
tried and true old authors are good enough for him. 
Miss Clara Herbert, of the children's department of 
the District of Columbia Public Library, reports for 
the past year a continued steady demand for the 
books of Scott, Dickens, Cooper, Stevenson, and 
Pyle. Furthermore, not only is it these standard 
novels that the young people demand for their light 
reading, but they show a disposition, in the com- 
munity named, to avail themselves increasingly of 
the library's stores of more instructive literature. 
The demand for fiction declined in the last twelve 
months two per cent, despite the granting of unusual 
privileges in the drawing of books from that class. 
The ready response of children everywhere to intelli- 
gent and tactful encouragement in the choice of the 
best books is a source of satisfaction to the library 
worker. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



AN EARLIER AMERICAN ACADEMY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

It is interesting to notice how history repeats itself in 
small things as in great. The American Academy, 
which has been given considerable prominence of late, 
invites comparison with a similar institution that ran its 
brief career some ninety years ago. 

" The American Academy of Language and Belles 
Lettres " apparently owed its inception to the efforts of 
William S. Cardell, a now forgotten New York linguist 
and grammarian. The object and plan of the proposed 
organization were announced in a circular issued in 1820, 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



81 



and later in the same year a constitution was adopted 
and officers were elected. The Academy was located 
in New York, and consisted of resident, corresponding, 
and honorary members. Resident and corresponding 
members were in every respect on an equality, except 
that the latter had the privilege of submitting their 
votes on any subject in writing. The number of mem- 
bers was at first fifty, and this might be increased to a 
maximum of one hundred and twenty. The fees were 
twenty-five dollars on admission, and two dollars a year 
thereafter. It was expected that public-spirited citi- 
zens who were not members would furnish funds to 
carry on the work of the Academy. Meetings were to 
be held quarterly, and the annual meeting was to be 
distinguished by a learned address The officers, — all 
of whom, it was announced, consented to serve, — were : 
President, John Quincy Adams, LL.D.; vice-presidents, 
Hon. Brockholst Livingston, Hon. Joseph Story, Hon. 
William Lowndes; corresponding secretary, William 
S. Cardell; recording secretary, Alexander McLeod, 
D.D.; treasurer, John Stearns, M.D.; counsellors, Hon. 
Daniel Webster, Thomas C. Brownell, D.D., LL.D, 
Bishop of Connecticut, John M. Mason, D.D., Joseph 
Hopkinson, LL.D., Peter S. DuPonceau, LL.D., John 
Augustin Smith, M.D., president of William and Mary 
College, Hon. John Lewis Taylor, chief justice of North 
Carolina, Hon. Henry Clay, Washington Irving, James 
Kent, LL.D. 

The prospectus, which to a modern reader seems al- 
most blatantly patriotic, says of the Academy that " Its 
prime object is to harmonize and determine the English 
language; but it will also, according to its discretion and 
means, embrace every branch of useful and elegant 
literature, and especially whatever relates to our own 
country." It was particularly charged with the duty of 
regulating the introduction of Americanisms, and of con- 
trolling innovations in spelling. Recent correspondence 
and comment in The Dial render especially interesting 
a sentence which the authors themselves italicize : " The 
Professors of Rhetoric and Logick, in our best univer- 
sities, should at least agree in spelling the names of the im- 
portant sciences they teach." A resolution adopted at a 
meeting held in the City Hall, New York, October 20, 
1820, shows something of the aims of the society, and 
in its wording — unless it suffered violence from a con- 
temporary printer — it furnishes a surprising example 
of Academic English. 

u Resolved, that a premium of not less than four hundred 
dollars, and a gold medal worth fifty dollars, be given to the 
author, being an American citizen, who within two years 
shall produce the best written history of the United States, 
and which, with such history shall contain a suitable exposi- 
tion of the situation, character and interests, absolute and 
relative, of the American Republic : calculated for a class- 
book in academies and schools. This work is to be examined 
and approved by a committee of the institution, in reference 
to the interest of its matter, the justness of its facts and prin- 
ciples, the purity, perspicuity and elegance of its style, and 
its adaptation to its intended purpose. 

" Though it is wished to interfere as little as possible with 
the freedom of judgment, in authors ; yet it will be expected 
that the examining committee, in accepting a work which is 
to receive the premium and sanction of the society, will sug- 
gest the alteration of any word, phrase or figure, which is not 
strictly pure and correct, according to the best usage of the 
English Language." 

At later meetings, in 1821 or 1822, prizes were offered 
for other text-books, a gold medal was awarded to 
Charles Botta for his History of the American Revolu- 



tion, and a committee was appointed to compile a list 
of Americanisms from all parts of the country. 

There is no record of the manner in which this ambi- 
tious institution came to its end, and, notwithstanding 
the illustrious list of officers, its whole career is some- 
what clouded m obscurity. There was an evident 
attempt to make it really national. In its latest pub- 
fished list of members, less than one-third were residents 
of New York, and most of the officers were from other 
sections of the country. With the faculties for com- 
munication that existed in 1820, such an organization 
was not workable. In an article in the " North Amer- 
ican Review," Edward Everett, with some show of sec- 
tional jealousy, implies that the affairs of the Academy 
were wholly controlled by the New York members, if 
not by the corresponding secretary alone. Indeed, the 
affair may be an illustration of the way in which one 
enthusiastic and persistent man can organize and keep 
alive a movement that might conceivably have great 
significance. The institution, however, won letters of 
commendation, and acceptance of membership and office, 
from men quite as distinguished as later Academicians, 
and it called forth in the periodical press comment not 
very unlike that which is now being bestowed on its 
successor. William B. Cairns.

A "LIBRARY OF THE MASTERS" AT MOUNT 

HOLYOKE COLLEGE 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The Standard Authors Room, or " Browsing " Room, 
in the new Smith College Library, to which you lately 
called attention, is worthy of wide-spread notice. The 
need of special invitation to the company of choice 
spirits, wise and witty, in literature, is keenly felt in the 
colleges, and in society at large, in these days of fierce 
competition of invitations and engagements. 

This is not the first room and collection dedicated to 
the delights of the companionship with books. Mr. 
William E. Foster, librarian of the Providence (R. I.) 
Public Library, mused over the idea for several years 
while the plans were taking shape for a magnificent 
new building, which, when complete, embodied his 
thought in an inviting room with the mural motto, 
" The books invite you not to study but to taste and 
read." 

Among other libraries which have followed a similar 
plan is that of Mount Holyoke College, which devotes 
a wing, separated by arches from the current periodical 
room, to its " Library of the Masters." It is a favorite 
corner, partly because of easy chairs and window seats, 
but also we believe because of the appeal, mute but 
potent, from the great authors who are there given 
favorable environment. The classes of 1904, 1896, and 
1897, at graduation or reunion, have provided funds for 
> English, Greek and Latin, and German literatures, 
respectively; and a few individual donors have given 
something from other literatures especially desired. 
Futher additions are expected. If there are worthy 
English translations of foreign works, they are wel- 
comed along with the originals. Readings by those 
who know and love the poets and seers have led their 
hearers into some new pathways.

The Biography of a Famous Geologist.* 

The Dwights and the Whitneys have acquitted 
themselves well in the settling and subduing of 
the New England wilderness, both families hav- 
ing established themselves in Massachusetts in 
the first half of the seventeenth century, and 
multiplied with the rapidity natural and desir- 
able in immigrants of sturdy stock. No de- 
scendants of those early settlers have reflected 
more credit on their ancestry than the large 
family sprung from the union of Abel Whitney 
and Clarissa Dwight. Josiah Dwight Whitney, 
eldest son of these two, business man and banker 
of Northampton, became the father of Josiah 
Dwight Whitney (born in 1819), the eminent 
geologist and man of science. Sarah Willis ton, 
representative of another good New England 
family, and a woman of unusual loveliness of 
character and of good mental endowment, was 
the mother of the young Josiah and of seven 
younger children besides. To these eight were 
afterward added five more children by a second 
marriage of the father. But it is the fortunes of 
the first of the thirteen that here concern us, and 
that have been ably and interestingly traced by 
the pen of Mr. Edwin Tenney Brewster in his 
" Life and Letters of Josiah Dwight Whitney." 

The education of parents, as the author re- 
marks, is gained largely at the expense of the 
first child ; and so Josiah was made to pay 
rather heavily for the parental inexperience of 
his father and mother. Unwise and harsh re- 
strictions and unduly severe punishments in- 
duced, it may reasonably be supposed, what is 
described as " a certain cloudiness of temper 
which he never completely outgrew." Yet he 
loved his parents none the less warmly, though 
he showed in more ways than one an edifying 
determination not to be puritanized out of all 
capacity to enjoy life to the full and in his own 
way. A favorite sister's repeated endeavors to 
bring him to a conviction of sin always found 
him affectionately and imperturbably unrespon- 
sive. From one of his father's letters to him 
when he was attending Stiles French's private 
school in New Haven, after three years at 
Cogswell's and Bancroft's Eound Hill School 
in Northampton, we quote a passage character- 
istic of the writer and of the period.

Preparation for college was completed by 
young Whitney at Phillips Academy, Andover, 
and he was graduated from Yale in his twen- 
tieth year, well-grounded in the rudiments and 
accomplished in fencing, riding, dancing, and 
in playing the violin, flute, and guitar. He 
also drew and painted with a dexterity that 
served him well when he came to illustrate his 
own voluminous geological reports in later 
years. Postgraduate study and laboratory work 
in chemistry followed the college course, and 
we find him now in Boston with Dr. Jackson 
(of renown in connection with the first use of 
ether as an anaesthetic), now in Philadelphia 
with Dr. Robert Hare, and later in Paris, Ber- 
lin, and other European seats of learning. But 
Dr. Jackson's interest in geology, as head of 
the New Hampshire geological survey, had 
helped to turn his pupil's attention to that and 
kindred branches of science, and this bent be- 
came more and more confirmed with the passing 
of time and with the increasingly important 
and responsible positions offered to him in 
mining engineering and in more general survey 
work throughout our then undeveloped West. 
The California survey, which came to him in 
1860 and occupied his time until 1874 when 
he accepted the Sturgis-Hooper professorship at 
Harvard, may be called the parent of the great 
national geological survey which is still in 
progress. 

The author has favored his readers with 
many of Whitney's family and friendly letters. 
They are written with a dash and spirit and a 
sense of humor that make them the best of 
reading. In a brief season of special study at 
Harvard he is found writing to his brother at 
Williams — William Dwight Whitney, the 
Sanskritist in embryo — in the following cheer- 
ful vein: 

" What on earth they wanted to locate a college up 
among those hills for, I can't conceive; the most aston- 
ishing part of it is that they find students to stay in

such an out-of-the-way corner of the earth, when they 
might come down to Cambridge and become members 
of the greatest University in all creation. You must 
know that I have advanced a step in life; I have 
acquired new honors and shed immortal lustre on old 
Harvard by becoming a Resident Graduate. That is to 
say, I signed a piece of paper binding myself, my heirs 
and executors forever, to pay One Hundred Dollars in 
case I should run off with any of the books which I 
expect to obtain from the College Library, say an old 
Indian Grammar or two and a musty history of New 
Hampshire. . . . Having been here more than a fort- 
night, 1 may consider myself at home, especially at the 
table, where I do prodigious execution among the muf- 
fins and baked apples, no doubt much to the dismay of 
those who feel a deep interest in the motions of my 
knife and fork. ... It is forbidden to talk Greek or 
quote Patagonian, so that, although we are very learned, 
no one would suspect it to hear us talk." 

The men of eminence, in science or otherwise, 
whom the wandering scholar became acquainted 
with, and who showed a liking and appreciation 
for him, were many. Liebig and Berzelius, 
Agassiz and Dana and Gibbs, Theodore Parker 
and Starr King and Eliphalet Nott, all seem to 
have been considerably more than passing ac- 
quaintances. "Agassiz is a very fascinating 
man, ' he writes to his brother William, "and 
it is impossible not to like him, even in ac- 
knowledging that he, like all the rest of man- 
kind, has his faults (except you and me). Dana 
is a k brick and no mistake.' n His admiration 
for Theodore Parker and hearty enjoyment of 
the arch heretic's Music Hall discourses form a 
significant commentary on his strict upbringing 
in the town of Jonathan Edwards, and in fact 
in a house standing on the very site of the 
Edwards dwelling. The Rev. Eliphalet Nott, 
for sixty years president of Union College, was 
past eighty when Whitney first met him, but 
had still ten years of work before him. He 
seems to have regarded the young geologist with 
affection as well as esteem. Mrs. Whitney — 
Louisa Howe, to whom Whitney was married in 
1854 — writes in a letter to her brother-in-law, 
William, some words in praise of this remark- 
able man that are worth quoting here. 

"I would have come barefoot with scrip and shell 
and staff to this place [Schenectady] to do reverence to 
Dr. Nott. He is even more benevolent and unselfish 
than your grandfather, with far, far more talent, 
breadth of range, and depth of thought. He is an im- 
proved St. John — as much love and more brains. You 
may imagine how my veneration, which I am generally 
obliged to feed with a Barmecide dinner of abstracts and 
ideals, flaps her wings and exults. I am perpetually on 
my knees before this shining reality of worth." 

The writer of this enthusiastic letter is not 
the least interesting character in the book. After 
fifteen years of an unhappy first marriage, she 
had at last found a worthy object for her affec- 



tions and her admiration, and though it was a 
hard and unsettled life she led at first with the 
wandering geologist, she played her part with 
cheerfulness and spirit, and was an efficient aid 
to her husband in various ways. 

With the settlement at Cambridge and the 
occupancy of a professor's chair in many respects 
the most desirable of any in America, the less 
eventful portion of Whitney's life begins, and 
may be here rather briefly dismissed. The 
drudgery of teaching was not imposed upon him, 
though it was to some extent voluntarily assumed. 
Study and research were pursued with what zeal 
the Sturgis-Hooper professor chose, and in what- 
ever direction. Occupation rather philological 
than geological was found in assisting his brother 
William on the Century Dictionary, of which 
Dr. Benjamin E. Smith was the " managing 
editor." The humors of lexicography under this 
editor's supervision are more than once touched 
upon by Whitney. " I am continually trying 
to impress it on the Smithian mind," he writes 
to his brother, " that dictionaries are no authori- 
ties. You have already got some ' gimcracks ' 
in the C. D., and very seedy they look ! '' 

Professor Whitney died in the summer of 
1896. The impulse he gave to the study of 
geology in America, and the number of com- 
petent geologists he sent forth from his class- 
room, are matters regarding which those who 
know speak with great respect. Certain it is 
that he was the first American geologist of both 
European training and wide practical expe- 
rience. The story of his life-work, as faithfully 
and attractively told by Mr. Brewster, is stim 
ulating, and also more universal in its appeal 
than might have been expected. A bibliography 
of fourteen pages, and a long list of " titles, ap- 
pointments, and memberships in learned socie- 
ties of Josiah D wight Whitney," with careful 
index and many good illustrations, are welcome 
additions to the narrative.

Ak Emerson revival in England, where our Concord 
sage has never enjoyed anything like the favor that 
America early accorded to his friend Carlyle, is reported 
in connection with the London issue of the first two 
volumes of the " Journals." At about the same time 
appears, there as here, an attractive edition of Emer- 
son's essay on Friendship, bound in the same volume 
with Cicero's treatment of the same theme. Surely the 
people who bike M. Maeterlinck's mysticism may well 
take pleasure in Emerson's transcendentalism. H Car- 
lyle's louder tones are now sufficiently hushed to permit 
his gentle friend from over the sea to be heard, in spite 
of the little relished " English Traits," there is cause 
for congratulation.

[Feb. 1, 



The Music of Primitive Man.* 

Mr. Frederick R. Burton, in his book on 
" American Primitive Music," gives the results 
of studies made amongst the Indians, chiefly 
the Ojibways, resident in the regions north of 
Lake Huron and Lake Superior. Mr. Burton 
was connected as an expert with the ethnologi- 
cal departments of the American Museum of 
Natural History in New York, and the Field 
Columbian Museum in Chicago. He lived for 
some time with the Ojibways, and was by them 
adopted into the tribe. He shows genuine 
sympathy with the customs and habits of the 
people with whom he deals, and, being himself 
a musician of learning and experience, seems 
just the man to make the most of his subject. 
He states that he has taken up this special work 
on its musical side, and considers its scientific 
aspects as merely by-products, so far as he is 
concerned. Nevertheless, he has made a real 
contribution to a discussion of the matter, and 
is in every sense a witness of unusual discrimina- 
tion and significance. 

Mr. Burton divides the music of the tribes 
living north of Mexico into three sections : that 
of the Indians of the pueblos, that of the 
dwellers on the northern Pacific coast, that of 
the inhabitants of the forests and the plains. 
The music of these last is evidently a higher 
development than that of the others, and the 
Ojibways appear to have been noteworthy in the 
character and completeness of their songs. The 
difficulties of observation were clearly many and 
the musical records obtained require frequent 
emendation and interpretation. The influence 
of civilization upon the Indian has subjected the 
native song to a process of modification which 
makes it frequently very hard, or even impossi- 
ble, to recover the originals. Moreover, civil- 
ized music has driven the native material into 
the background, and unless genuine and well- 
directed efforts are made to collect what is yet 
to be had, the whole will vanish into the limbo 
of the outlived and lost, there to mingle with 
many ghosts whose shrivelled lips give forth no 
utterance, much as we interrogate and eager as 
we are to hear. 

The questions which arise in the discussion 
of primitive music are many. A great deal of 
the latter, of course, can hardly be called music 
at all, except in the sense that it is the promise 
of better things to come. There is the usual 
chaos of elements, the vagrant gleams of appre-

hension here and there, the sudden appearance 
of results, sporadic and followed by a relapse 
into the precedent confusions. According to 
Mr. Burton, the song accompanies every activity 
of the Indian. The planting of the corn, the 
chopping of the fuel, the skimming of the river 
in the canoe, the setting out on the journey, the 
courtship and the wedding, the passing of the 
spirit into immortality, are all sung in a rude 
and tentative fashion. The civilized man does 
the same ; but the primitive custom is communal 
and tribal , the hymn or the secular melody has 
its composer in the whole clan, the famous 
singer is only one who has signalized himself as 
a leader of the choir, the music is handed down 
by tradition subject to the vicissitudes which are 
part of such a method of transmission. 

The author discusses at length the subjects of 
Indian Scales, Rhythms, Melodies ; the char- 
acter of the poetry conjoined to the song ; the 
possible use of the Indian music as thematic 
material for the American composer. He is 
not wholly in agreement with other investigators 
in the same field, — Dr. Franz Boas of the 
American Museum of Natural History, New 
York, who has made a study of Esquimo songs, 
and Mr. Benjamin Ives Gilman, who has done 
his work among the Zunis and Hopis and other 
dwellers in the pueblos of the Southwest. The 
questions that are raised relate to the intervals 
employed, the scale lying at the basis of the 
songs, the comparative completeness of the 
melody. Mr. Burton, using his observations 
amongst the Ojibways, gives to the Indian music 
a considerably higher value than do the others. 
He admits that the Ojibways are exceptional 
in this direction. He seems, however, not to 
emphasize sufficiently the tribal characteristics 
of the Indian music. This is not the creation 
of any single composer, but is the work of the 
tribe in its various activities. Like early poetry, 
it has not been made by any single man, but 
has come forth at various gatherings of the 
people, at the war conclaves, or the secular 
festivals, or the religious ceremonies in which the 
entire community joins. 

There is, throughout, the constant struggle to 
attain what is, after all, attained but partially. 
There is the struggle for the correct interval, 
the struggle for something approaching the 
scale, the struggle for a consistent melody. The 
rude dweller in the forests and mountains makes 
his first efforts at musical art ; his sense of 
rhythm is merely elementary, and he can develop 
it with only relative consistency ; his power of 
appreciating intervals is even less satisfactory, 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



85 



for the effort here required is of a higher type, 
and finds the usual successes and failures ; the 
adiatonic interval will make its appearance, and 
in process of time will be eliminated. The con- 
struction of a melody is an achievement which 
he will struggle towards, but with limited suc- 
cess ; and beyond that the American forest 
dweller has apparently no incentive to go. Mr. 
Burton probably presents in his songs the last 
reach of Indian effort in the way of music, and 
one need not be surprised if he makes all he can 
out of these melodies, which have in their very 
incompleteness an alluring quality that gives 
them a special charm. 

According to statements made in Mr. Bur- 
ton's work, the Indian music is based upon a 
pentatonic scale, which has both a major and a 
minor mode. It is rare to find the fourth and 
the seventh in the same song. The melody only 
seldom terminates on the tonic. In the matter 
of rhythm also there are great peculiarities. 
There is often one rhythm in the accompanying 
drum, another in the vocal score, and a third in 
the dance in which everybody indulges. The 
only musical instruments which the Indian pos- 
sesses are the drum and the rattle. He makes 
a rudimentary flageolet ; but the sole use which 
he knows for it is in his declarations of affection 
for his inamorata. Mr. Burton gives a large 
number of melodies in the form in which the 
Indian uses them. He also translates the words, 
and has a chapter on Indian poetry. The mean- 
ing of the songs is often not on the surface. It 
sometimes requires an intimate acquaintance 
with Indian life and habits to get the drift of 
the words. In many cases the text is archaic, 
and the Indian himself gets small meaning from 
it. Where the text and the melody do not easily 
flow together, he helps himself over the difficulty 
by the introduction of meaningless syllables, like 
our hey, ho, nonino. Twenty-eight of these songs 
are here presented in a civilized version with 
piano accompaniments. They are done with 
skill, and retain most of their aboriginal flavor 
in spite of the sophistication. It is an open ques- 
tion, no doubt, to what extent such liberties are 
to be taken with primitive art. The practice, 
however, may perhaps be defended on the ground 
that the melody is glorified in the process, and 
the Indian version in its simplicity is found as 
well as the ennobled substitute in this book. The 
matter appeals diversely to the musician and the 
scientist. 

Mr. Burton suggests the use of the Indian 
melodies as thematic material for American com- 
posers. He deplores the dearth of folk-music 



among us, and thinks that our poverty in this 
respect may change into something approaching 
the European opulence by turning to the un- 
expected sources of wealth furnished by our 
mountains and prairies. He also alludes to the 
abundance of tunes, mostly religious, thrust into 
our lap by the negro. It must, however, occur 
to everyone that this is after all alien material. 
The musician, no doubt, like every artist, has 
the whole world before him, — he has Teutonic 
folk-songs at his disposition, and Norwegian, 
and Romaic, and others. Yet the composer has 
shown small inclination to overleap national bar- 
riers. Perhaps here is the achievement in music 
now to be made, and the innovator will under- 
stand how to find use for material furnished by 
all parts of the earth ; or has, indeed, the leit- 
motif 'run its course already, and will a still freer 
application of musical methods be the purpose 
of the masters to come ? 

Mr. Burton has made a satisfactory presenta- 
tion of his subject. He is not to be grudged 
his right to idealize his man and give the Indian 
a claim to achievement higher than others have 
done. Probably it is time to do justice in this 
regard. Also, the ethnologist is more in accord 
with the writer than the latter seems to think 
he is. Moreover, Mr. Burton has a fluent and 
entertaining style, and without sacrificing accu- 
racy or completeness has made a book which 
was well worth his while. The publishers, on 
their part, have sent out a handsome volume.

A Great English Historian.* 



History, comprehensively understood and 
wisely interpreted, gives us the fundamental 
principles of human life. With all its misappre- 
hensions and perversions, it has been, and must 
continue to be, the practical exhibition and sum- 
mation of human wisdom. No English historian 
has better understood this fact, or given himself 
more unreservedly to its lessons, than Lecky. 
His original endowments and their uninter- 
rupted development adapted him to this his- 
torical work. Gifted with ready speech and 
interested in practical questions, in early life he 
coveted a position in Parliament. He shortly 
came to see — and all the more, perhaps, be- 
cause such a hope was not among his possibil- 
ities — that his most useful labors lay in another

direction. When, nearly at the close of life, he 
was chosen to represent Trinity College, Dublin, 
in Parliament, though he performed the labors 
of the position faithfully, he found them to 
involve much drudgery, and to use up the 
strength he would prefer to devote to literary 
tasks. " The work is physically very tiring," 
he said, " and I often feel that a good deal of 
it might be done equally well, with a little train- 
ing, by a fairly intelligent poodle-dog." 

Few historians have so justly estimated their 
true function, and even fewer have pursued it 
with equal diligence. He aimed to have the 
facts of the period under consideration fully be- 
fore him, and to apprehend them with the under- 
standing of those who were prominent in them. 
He cultivated that breadth of sympathy which 
enables us to comprehend the actions of our 
fellow men, and at the same time to recognize 
their bearings on the general welfare. " History 
is never more valuable than when it enables us, 
standing as on a height, to look beyond the 
smoke and turmoil of our petty quarrels, and to 
detect in the slow development of the past the 
great permanent forces that are steadily bearing 
nations onward to improvement or decay." 

He did not limit his attention to the military 
or civic events in the national story, but strove 
fully to enter into the forces which were at work 
at any time to help forward the development of 
a people. History, as a complex of individuals, 
may be worked out biographically, and so have 
the zest of personal narrative. This is its more 
fascinating presentation. It may also be written 
in a less personal form, as a combination of forces 
and motives, often obscure, which are working 
profoundly or superficially in the minds of men, 
and, half consciously, controlling their actions. 
While the first form is more entertaining and 
dramatic, it is liable to carry the entertainment 
beyond the sober commonplace facts which actu- 
ally shape events. We are more occupied with 
the fortunes of the boat and the boatmen than 
we are with the open way and the obstructions 
of the river itself. What we need to know are 
the conditions and possibilities the time offered 
to those who are the agents of the public welfare. 

There are two allied but somewhat diverse 
lines of inquiry in Lecky's works. The one 
which first occupied him resulted in the volumes 
on " The Rise and Influence of the Spirit of 
Rationalism" and " The History of European 
Morals, from Augustus to Charlemagne." These 
both bear on the fundamental terms under which 
the religious convictions and the ethical char- 
acter of men are developed. No discussion is 



embarrassed by more prejudice, or calls for more 
breadth of observation and sympathetic insight. 
These discussions prepared the way for the 
second forms of inquiry, " The History of 
England in the Eighteenth Century " and 
" Democracy and Liberty." Both lines were 
united in the " Leaders of Public Opinion in 
Ireland " and in « The Map of Life." The first 
and higher line of consideration was needful as 
a preparation for the lower but more comprehen- 
sive one, embraced in his " History of England." 
The candor of Lecky was established in his ear- 
lier work, and went manifestly with him where 
its exercise was even more difficult — in the nar- 
rative of the eighteenth century which covered 
a passionate period in English life. Other En- 
glishmen have written influential histories and 
presented the current of events seething under 
living forces ; but none have surpassed Lecky 
in a wide, quiet, conservative estimate of the 
influences and motives at work in the English 
people. Carlyle ruffled his narrative with over- 
powering personal conviction ; events were not 
given in their integrity, but under the livid 
light the author cast upon them. Buckle read 
the history of nations as if it had been a palimp- 
sest whose significance had just been discovered 
and whose usual interpretation was merely a dis- 
guise ; he thereby exercised much influence on 
active minds, but an influence a large part of 
which was lost again as the natural force of 
events was restored. 

This detachment of Lecky was the more 
remarkable as he was an Irishman, and took a 
leading part in the discussions of a period which 
called out much passion. He went through the 
vicissitudes of opinion incident to Home Rule, 
and in them all he showed the same quiet com- 
posure of thought. No one better deserves per- 
sonal recollection, or, in the confusion of events, 
more strongly calls us back to a sober estimate 
of the forces with which we have to do. 

The memoir of Lecky, by his wife, is to be 
commended for the fulness of the material 
offered and for its natural arrangement. It is 
not fulsome, as the abundant praise is given by 
third persons. Under the circumstances, it may 
be pronounced to be a work well done. Yet it 
lacks something of the charm of the very best 
biography, which we are learning more than 
hitherto to fashion. We have come to desire 
the weakness and the strength, the successes and 
the deficiencies, of the life before us, its human 
as well as its superhuman side. We desire a 
delineation in which we can deeply sympathize, 
as well in its struggles as in its triumphs. Lecky

seems to have had few frailties. He demanded 
little for himself, and readily gave full apprecia- 
tive praise to others. At times, under the ex- 
haustion of hard work, he lost mental courage 
and took a disparaging view of his productions. 
But he was fond of physical beauty, and was able 
to restore the tone of his mind by a few weeks 
of uninterrupted enjoyment of nature. Nothing 
really detracts from the merit of Lecky, and we 
need perhaps even the more to know the few 
obstructions that lay in his path. For this work 
of chastened delineation, a wife is not very 
well fitted. Her best impulses are all on the 
side of her husband, and recognition of the 
abatement of his powers or observation of the 
burdens that oppressed him are liable to bear 
to her something of the appearance of unfaith- 
fulness to his memory. j OHN Bascom. 



Health. Character, and Eyesight.* 

The sixth volume of Dr. Gould's " Biographic 
Clinics " is made up of twenty-two essays which 
were originally published in the leading medical 
journals of this country, and completes a series 
the first volume of which was published in 1903. 
Eye-strain and its effects on the human organism 
have always been the main theme of Dr. Gould's 
writings : and a glance at the table of contents 
of the present volume might lead the reader to 
judge of it as a collection of technical writings 
of interest only to the professional world. This 
is, however, not the case ; for the author's idea 
has been that the public should be most keenly 
interested in any medical discovery, or in the 
new light which study and discovery throw upon 
any already accepted medical doctrine. He has 
therefore adopted the plan of presenting his 
theories and the results of his researches in such 
a way as to appeal to the lay-world as well as to 
the profession. 

" Test cases " may be of clinical value, and 
are necessary in a volume dealing with a special- 
ized branch of medicine ; but their interest is 
limited largely to the physician or the medical 
student. To make their interest more general, 
and yet illustrate his theory by means of clinical 
material, Dr. Gould selected twenty-one of the 
most prominent characters in literature (De 
Quincey, Carlyle, Darwin, Huxley, Browning, 
George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, Wagner, 

* Biographic Clinics. Essays Concerning the Influence 
of Visual Function. Pathologic and Physiologic, upon the 
Health of Patients. Volume VI. By George M. Gould. M.D. 
Philadelphia : P. Blakiston's Son & Co. 



Parkman, etc.), and by carefully gathering from 
biographies, letters from friends and relatives, 
and other trustworthy sources, any mention 
which has been made of their health, he has 
proved beyond all doubt that all of these char- 
acters suffered during a part of their lives from 
some obscure and unexplained disease, and the 
cause of all their suffering he believes was 
eye-strain. To the general reader it is certainly 
more interesting to be reminded of Mrs. Carlyle's 
aches and pains, or of Wagner's repeated com- 
plaints, than to read " case reports," no matter 
how careful and accurate they may be. Dean 
Swift and " Some added testimony in the case of 
Wagner " are the only illustrious biographic 
clinics in the volume ; and it is to be regretted 
that Dr. Gould feels that his work in this field 
has been completed. 

Mr. William Ashton Ellis, who has con- 
tributed the chapter on Wagner, " The Pessi- 
mist," has enthusiastically accepted Dr. Gould's 
theory of eye-strain in the case of Wagner ; and 
in his monumental " Life of Richard Wagner " 
he has devoted a whole chapter to this question, 
concluding that eye-strain and its pathologic and 
physiologic effects had played an important 
part in the development of the great musician's 
character. In his latest book, the " Letters of 
Richard to Minna Wagner," we find Wagner 
giving fresh proof of his sufferings and of his 
increasing visual defect. 

A medical theory, however, cannot be estab- 
lished by means of interesting speculation, and 
it is not enough merely to collect evidence in its 
favor from the past. It must be demonstrated, 
both as to its theory and application, by its 
practical results. Dr. Gould's sixth volume, 
which is the closing one of the series, is a 
comprehensive review of the entire field of the 
author's work in his particular branch of medi- 
cine, and is a complete resume of his theory of 
eye-strain and of its far-reaching results. The 
reader of medical literature will find it useful 
to examine the chapters on the subject of " Eye- 
strain and Epilepsy " or a " Mysterious Case 
of Suicide." The author clears up the myth of 
Meniere's disease, and defines the phenomena 
of a new discovery in ophthalmology under the 
name of ophthalmovascular choke : while mi- 
graine, common sick-headache, and many minor 
ills, come in for their share in the discussion of 
cases selected for his " Brief Biographic Clinics 
upon living patients." 

All of these articles are written with remark- 
able clearness and directness, and the unhesi- 
tating emphasis used throughout the book

compels and holds the interest of the reader. 
Dr. Gould is fully in possession of his facts, and 
crowds into a few pages the result of his wide 
reading and matured thought. The articles 
which best illustrate his skill in the vivid and 
concise exposition of new ideas are the chapters 
entitled " Vision and Senility " and the " Role 
of Visual Function in Animal and Human 
Evolution." The cause of senility has been the 
subject of much discussion by eminent patholo- 
gists during the past few years. It has been 
attributed either to the hardening of the arter- 
ies, the weakening of the, heart, to changes in 
the cells, or to germs in the blood and body. 
Dr. Gould, however, claims that these are the 
results of senility, not its cause. The real 
cause, he tells us, is in the eyes. At the age of 
forty-five or fifty most men and women begin 
to have impaired vision; their ability to work 
fails ; their usefulness is diminished ; and they 
are forced into inactivity which speedily affects 
their interest and purpose. They are practi- 
cally " laid aside " or " put on the shelf," accord- 
ing to their own words, and slip quickly into 
the helpless senility of old age. If, on the con- 
trary, they have passed the critical or presbyopic 
period without losing any of their visual acumen, 
they are still capable of continuing a life of 
achievement. Knowledge, experience, and judg- 
ment, added to the results gained by a long life 
of study and reading, are the acquisitions and 
activities which should accompany increasing 
years. Dr. Gould's philosophy on this subject 
should be an inspiration to all those who find 
themselves growing old. 

" The Role of the Visual Function in Animal 
and Human Evolution " does not refute Darwin's 
principles of evolution, but enlarges them by 
showing that one of the chief causes for the 
development of the fit, and for the elimination 
of the unfit, has been the fitness or unfitness of 
the eyes for the struggle attendant upon exist- 
ence. The biologic origin of the eye and the 
stages of development through which it has 
passed are explained. Only a scientist who 
has carefully studied this subject could have 
presented so clearly the complex factors in this 
development, and we are indebted to Dr. Gould 
for giving us the results of his labors in this 
most interesting field of original research. 



The Old South Society of Boston celebrated last April 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ministry of Dr. George 
A. Gordon; and a record of the event appears in the 
shape of a beautifully-printed volume which reports the 
sermons and addresses delivered upon that occasion. 



Two Great Foes of Slavery.* 



Two statesmen could hardly be more different 
the one from the other than were the two great 
leaders of the Republican party whose newly- 
written Lives appear before us for review. In 
almost every personal characteristic they were 
opposites, as they were in training, experience, 
and environment. One was a New England 
Brahmin, cold, domineering, exclusive, ultra- 
refined, a devotee of art and literature, abso- 
lutely without the sense of humor and with little 
knowledge of human nature. The other was a 
Kentucky poor-white, genial, approachable, self- 
trained and without formal culture, bubbling 
over with humor, knowing the hearts of men. 
Even their leading motives were not the same : 
Lincoln, much as he hated slavery, thought first 
of the Union and its preservation ; while the 
wrongs of the Negro, the wickedness of the men 
who wronged him, and the righting of those 
wrongs, were first in Sumner's mind. Sumner 
had not the balance, the sense of proportion, 
the saving salt of humor, that Lincoln had ; 
and his fame is already growing dim, while that 
of Lincoln increases steadily. Sumner could 
never have foreseen this ; for he failed to under- 
stand Lincoln, he patronized him, and lectured 
him mercilessly, while he felt perfectly sure of 
his own fame. Professor Haynes, in his new 
Life of Sumner, illustrates the eclipse of that 
statesman's reputation by the answers submitted 
to college entrance examinations in Massachu- 
setts. He says : 

" Not one in ten of those boys in the commonwealth 
which Sumner had so long and so honorably represented 
showed any intelligent knowledge of the man. One re- 
plied : c Charles Sumner was always held in respect, even 
by the people of the South. Fort Sumner, Charleston, 
was named in his honor ' — an honor which several of the 
other papers also accorded him ! " 

The comparative fame of Lincoln and Sumner 
at this time is curiously shown by the fact that 
while one can get a fair idea of Lincoln's whole 
career from Haynes's Life of Sumner, the name 
of Sumner is not found at all in Putnam's Life 
of Lincoln. 

With all Sumner's limitations, he did most 
efficient service at a crisis when he was the man 
for the hour, and his position is sure in the rank 
of our leading statesmen if not of our popular

heroes. Professor Haynes's book is a clear and 
well-balanced formal biography of moderate size, 
its size and scope dictated by the requirements 
of the well-known series of American biographies 
to which it is added. The author shows himself 
a thorough student of the period, and his literary 
style is pleasing and effective. As the life of 
Sumner cannot be written apart from the leading 
political events of the exciting quarter-century 
between 1850 and 1875, the book is a readable 
and in the main trustworthy sketch of our 
national history during the Civil War era, as 
well as a good political biography of a forceful 
and interesting man. We cannot here under- 
take to follow through the outline of the book, 
which in the main takes the usual course familiar 
to students of the period. It will be a good 
reference-book for younger students of American 
history, and will interest readers who desire to 
become acquainted with the great men of the 
past century and lack time or energy for the 
mastery of the more extended biographies. The 
book naturally challenges comparison with the 
Life of Sumner by Mr. Moorfield Storey, issued 
in the " American Statesmen Series " ten years 
ago. Inevitably they are much alike, being 
written from the same point of view, each for a 
series of political biographies. The book of 
Professor Haynes is rather fuller on the per- 
sonal side, and shows us more of the man. It is 
also more interestingly written ; the author has 
not been overwhelmed by the mass of his mate- 
rial, but has organized and given life to the story 
he had to tell. 

Major Putnam's book is quite different, being 
a brief sketch of Lincoln and his work, enlarged 
from a centennial address given a year ago. Its 
origin indicates its character. Few details are 
given as the basis for characterization and appre- 
ciation, only the larger aspects of Lincoln's life 
being included in the treatment. There is little 
to mark the sketch as noteworthy until the Civil 
War is reached : here the writer's own experi- 
ences in the army, and his personal relations to 
men and events, add life to the sketch and give 
it value. But it is chiefly what it purports to 
be, an enlarged memorial address. Included in 
the volume is the text of Lincoln's Cooper 
Institute speech, one of the greatest of American 
speeches, and one that had an important influ- 
ence in the shaping of history. Recognizing its 
greatness and anticipating its influence, two 
young lawyers, Charles C. Nott and Cephas 
Brainerd, later leaders of the New York bar, 
had the address corrected by Mr. Lincoln, and 
published with introduction and elaborate his- 



torical notes. This pamphlet, and the accom- 
panying correspondence with Mr. Lincoln never 
before published, gives the book unique interest 
for the historical student.

Briefs on New Books. 

... . Collected in one volume, the mis- 

Addresses and 

essays, personal cellaneou8 contributions to historical 
and historical, writing made by Mr. James Ford 
Rhodes during the past ten years are published 
under the title " Historical Essays " (Macmillan Co. ) 
If more exact definition were needed, the title might 
be enlarged to " Essays on Historical "Writers and 
Writings." In one group would fall the addresses 
delivered to historical societies on the historians 
Gibbon, Gardiner, Lecky, Green, and Sir Spencer 
Walpole, of the English school, and on Edward L. 
Pierce, John D. Cox, Edward Gaylord Bourne, and 
E. L. Godkin, American writers. To another group 
belong four occasional addresses on ''History," 
"Concerning the Writing of History," "The Pro- 
fession of Historian," and "Newspapers as Historical 
Sources." The four remaining productions comprise 
a critical discussion of the presidential office, a re- 
view of the administration of President Hayes, a 
new estimate of Cromwell based on Gardiner's lec- 
tures, and an effort to prove that Columbia, S. C, 
was burned by looters of the city during the Civil 
War, and not by executive order. In these essays 
Mr. Rhodes preserves the painstaking accuracy 
characteristic of his former writings, but displays 
a slightly different style, since he is freed from the 
trammels of condensed narrative and has leisure to 
introduce a wealth of apt quotation. There is also 
the attractive personal note of a composition intended 
to be read to an audience. Especially does this be- 
come manifest in the personal tribute to the late E. G. 
Bourne, who was sometime an amanuensis to Mr. 
Rhodes. The essay on the presidential office is the 
most distinct contribution to historical writing, being 
descriptive of the contributions of each president to 
the prerogatives of the office. Hayes is praised for 
his " steadiness and equanimity " in office, and for 
his " serene amiability and hopefulness." Several 
of the essays are reprinted from magazines. The 
volume as a whole will be read with pleasure by 
the many admirers of the writings of this scholarly 

author.

Burr from sundry points of view, with reference to 
their motive, their greater or less subjectivity, the 
occupation and character of the writer, the strength 
or weakness of memory displayed, and so on. Five 
appended tabulations group and re-group the works 
according to divers schemes, and a full index fur- 
nishes still another survey of the authors discussed. 
In any such attempt as this to bring scientific method 
to bear on subject-matter that refuses to be bounded 
by the strict demarcations of science, there is neces- 
sarily much of personal bias and individual opinion. 
For example, in speaking of the greater objectivity 
manifest in "the intellectual life of elder civiliza- 
tions," Mrs. Burr declares that " this difference 
separates the ancient world from the modern as 
tangibly as a wall or a ditch " — which reminds 
one of the now discredited catastrophic theory of 
geologic change. She makes subjectivity, in a pro- 
nounced form, to begin with the Christian era, at 
least as far as the literary manifestation is concerned ; 
as if, centuries before, the Hindu and the Chinese 
mind had not attained to self-consciousness and left 
written evidence of the fact ; and as if the subjective 
element were not discernible even in certain of the 
ancient Greeks and Romans. Cicero, for instance, in 
his letters, his orations, and his philosophical writings, 
was very far from being dispassionately objective. 
On a later page she speaks of Caesar in the same 
breath with " our basis for the general and particular 
study of sincerity," linking his name with Augustine's 
and Cardano's. But if any chronicler of his own 
achievements ever understood the art of throwing 
dust in his reader's eyes, the self-styled conqueror 
of Gaul must be accounted an adept. An illuminat- 
ing word on this has recently come from Signor 
Ferrero's pen. However, these points must not be 
pressed unfairly. It is a new and far from easy task 
that Mrs. Burr has undertaken. With the exception 
of Professor Georg Misch's " Geschichte der Auto- 
biographien," of which the first volume has just 
appeared, and is noted by her after sending her own 
book to the press, her work is the only one of its kind 
in the field ; and its marks of painstaking industry, 
of careful thought, and of genuine enthusiasm, are 
too many to admit of aught, on the reviewer's part, 
but hearty commendation of the book. 

"The Old Librarian's Almanack," 
published at New Haven in 1773, 
and attributed to Master Jared Bean, 
Curator of the Connecticut Society of Antiquarians, 
is now re-issued as the first number of " The Libra- 
rian's Series " edited by Messrs. John Cotton Dana 
and Henry W. Kent, and published by the Elm 
Tree Press, of Woodstock, Vermont. The editor of 
this rare pamphlet is Mr. Edmund Lester Pearson, 
(" Librarian" of the Boston " Transcript "), who has 
already printed in that journal some choice extracts 
from the Almanack. After a brief preface setting 
forth all that is known about Master Bean and his 
Almanack (of which latter only two copies are now 
believed to be extant), Mr. Pearson leaves the reader

to revel at will in the unannotated pages of the 
unconscious humorist who has chosen to sign him- 
self " Philobiblos " (in Greek characters). " Book- 
lover " he emphatically is, resenting the intrusion 
of book-borrowers, or even book-readers, into the 
literary treasure-house whose guardian he is, and 
where his happiest hours are in the six weeks of 
summer when doors are closed and all books have 
been called in and restored to their places on the 
shelves. With Sir Thomas Bodley, he scouts the 
notion that domestic cares can be made compatible 
with a librarian's duties. Speaking of women and 
their blandishments, he admonishes us to " Shun 
them as you would the Devil." And again, as to 
admitting women to a library : " Be suspicious of 
Women. They are given to the Reading of frivo- 
lous Romances, and at all events, their presence in 
a Library adds little to (if it does not, indeed, de- 
tract from ) that aspect of Gravity, Seriousness and 
Learning which is its greatest Glory." A " warder 
of the accumulated record of the world's wisdom," 
he elsewhere says, should be " a person of sober and 
Godly life, learn'd, virtuous, chaste, moral, frugal 
and temperate." Entering into the details of libra- 
rianship, he gives rules and advice that will move 
the modern librarian to mirth. Rhymed maxims, 
too, are scattered down the calendar pages, as, " Let 
no intruders put your ease in doubt, Lock fast the 
door & keep the rascals out." The right-hand pages 
are devoted to more detailed and serious discussion 
of matters interesting to " bibliothecaries." In one 
instance this discussion takes metrical form, begin- 
ning, " First of all matters, 't is your greatest need 
To read unceasing & unceasing read." A rare treat 
is in store for all readers of " The Old Librarian's 
Almanack." 

Mr. Homer Lea, reinforced by Gen- 

-SE£&£*«*' Chaffee and Stor y> wh0 con - 

tribute introductory words of cordial 
agreement with the author, has made a conscientious 
and not ineffective attempt, in his book entitled 
"The Valor of Ignorance" (Harper), to frighten 
the peaceful civilian into a consciousness of his 
unpreparedness to repel a Japanese invasion. The 
book is divided into two parts, — the first dealing 
with general principles, such as the (supposed) 
inevitability of continual warfare as long as human 
nature remains human nature, and the unquestioned 
superiority of trained soldiers to raw recruits ; and 
the second expounding, in a manner terrifying to 
the dweller on the Pacific coast, the ease with which 
the Mikado could seize upon that fair portion of our 
domain, under circumstances that exist at present. 
Our sole salvation, thinks Mr. Lea, lies in a 
formidable standing army and a mighty navy. 
He would have our navy made double the strength 
of any European navy. But why stop there? Sup- 
pose, while we are about it, a coalition of European 
and Asiatic powers against the United States. To 
meet it, let us have a navy twice the size of all the 
other navies combined ; and as they increase in

strength, let our navy increase twice as fast. Why 
haggle over a few additional billions in our annual 
budget? One could take the author more seriously 
if he did not indulge in so many questionable gen- 
eralizations and assumptions. Granted his premises, 
the conclusions might follow. But when, for exam- 
ple, he asserts as an " invariable law " that " the 
boundaries of political units are never, other than 
for a moment of time, stationary — they must either 
expand or shrink," he is formulating a plausible 
enough theory, but one refuted by actual experience. 
Switzerland, — to take but one instance, — has been 
acknowledged as an independent nation since 1648, 
and for three centuries before that she existed as a 
confederation of liberty-loving cantons. Yet how 
much has she expanded meanwhile, and how much 
has she shrunk? And what signs does she show 
to-day of declining vigor ? It is not by such books 
as Mr. Lea's that universal peace is to be promoted, 
unless it be a peace armed to the teeth and more 
intolerable than an occasional war. 



Good advice M . r - J - D - Stewart's " How to Use a 
about using Library " (London : Elliot Stock) is 

a Library. intended to give practical advice on 

the use of libraries in England, and its contents are 
therefore largely of British interest. There is much 
in the book, however, that is of universal application, 
and it will doubtless appeal to some of our own 
librarians. There are a few books in the American 
book-market on " How to Read," or " Books Worth 
Reading," and so on, most of them having chapters 
on the use of libraries ; but there has not been col- 
lected in any one place sufficient practical informa- 
tion on the best use of libraries, and of their tools and 
accessories — catalogues and bibliographies. Mr. 
Stewart's book is not one to be followed too explicitly; 
for example, it makes no mention of inter-library 
loans, nor of the machinery of the library itself, a 
knowledge of which would certainly be of value to 
the users of libraries. The chapter on " Guides to 
Books " seems too closely confined to English bibli- 
ography ; this results in some cases in undue mea- 
greness, even for so short a list as is here intended. 
There is one queer misprint, on p. 27, where J. 
Power's "Handy Book about Books" (1870) and 
J. Sabin's " Bibliography of Bibliographies " (1877) 
have been combined into "J. Sabin's Handy Book 
about Books, 1877." 

A slender book of graceful essays on 
b V a Mi-s U \?e V a neii. little questions of art and literature, 

of nature and life, comes from the 
skilful pen of Mrs. Wilfrid Meynell (Alice Meynell) 
under the title, "Ceres' Runaway, and Other Essays" 
(Lane). The "runaway" that gives its name to 
the opening essay is the grass or other verdure 
which grows in the streets and squares of Rome, in 
defiance of paving-stones and street-cleaners, and 
for which the author confesses a lurking fondness. 
As was to be expected from Mrs. Meynell, most of 
her pages betray more or less opeidy a predilection 



for things Italian ; nor is this touch of enthusiasm 
a blemish on her work. The mere language of the 
country, and its patois, stir her to eloquence. So 
slight a phrase as piuttosto bruttini has a wonderf ul 
charm for her, though why she chooses the plural 
rather than the singular of the diminutive adjective 
for her praise does not appear. She contrasts our 
unmusical English with the liquid speech of Italy, 
but nevertheless finds a redeeming virtue in that 
convenient negative prefix, un, common to German 
and to English. But in denying that the French 
enjoy the use of a similar prefix with the participle, 
after the analogy of our " unloved " and " unfor- 
given," she forgets the occurrence of a few such 
words as inoui, inconnu, inhabits. She has an 
untrite chapter on the trite subject of laughter, and 
three excellent ones on certain characteristics of 
children, evidently based on first-hand knowledge. 
Her style throughout possesses distinction, now and 
then verging on preciosity, and occasionally some- 
what marred by little affectations — as her repeated 
spelling of "judgment" with a superfluous e. Far 
better, however, these small blemishes of over- 
carefulness than the looseness and wantonness com- 
mon to so many prose writers of our day. 



An echo of the ^ ihe da y 8 when Browning Societies 
Browning cult were abroad in the land, and essays 
m America. about Browning much in evidence, 
one of the most brilliant of these societies was the 
one in Boston, and one of its best writers was 
Francis B. Hornbrooke, D.D. At his death, six 
years ago, he left among his papers the manuscript 
of a book called " The Ring and the Book, an In- 
terpretation," which is now published with a " Fore- 
word " by Mrs. Hornbrooke (Little, Brown, & Co.). 
For those who like a book of this kind (and there 
are many who do) — who like to be told about a 
poem rather than to read the poem itself, who enjoy 
a prose paraphrase more than the original text — 
this is an excellent work. It concerns itself with 
analysis, description, and explanation, rather than 
with criticism ; it contains the comment and conclu- 
sions of one who was an appreciative reader and a 
good writer. If it shall serve to help readers of 
lesser insight, and to tempt them to turn to the 
original text of Browning's masterpiece, it will do 
good service.

boating on the Missouri, and takes us into the midst 
of the scenes of Western trade and Indian struggles. 
The volume is written ostensibly for the popular 
reader, and not for the scientific historian. As such, 
it is very well done, and holds the attention with 
somewhat the same qualities as a novel. It is 
undoubtedly one of the best stories of steamboat life 
that has appeared from the press in recent years. 



Notes. 



Mr. G. K. Chesterton is engaged upon a work which 
he proposes to call " What Is Wrong." The title is 
suggestive, and will arouse keen interest in his large 
circle of admirers. 

"The Interdict: Its History and Its Operation," by 
Dr. Edward B. Krehbiel, is an Adams Prize Essay, and 
is now published in book form by the American His- 
torical Association. 

The last of the three books by Marion Crawford, 
which were left unpublished at the time of their au- 
thor's death, is " The Undesirable Governess," which 
will appear this spring. 

" Life in the Greenwood," by Miss Marion Florence 
Lansing, is a volume of short stories for children retold 
from the Robin Hood ballads in simple prose. It is 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. in their " Open Road 
Library of Juvenile Literature," and is prettily illus- 
trated. 

" The History of Political Parties in the Province of 
New York, 1760-1776 " is the title of a bulky mono- 
graph by Professor Carl Lotus Becker, now published 
in the " History Series " of the University of Wisconsin 
Bulletin. The work is a doctoral dissertation of three 
years ago. 

Herr Sudermann's " Rosen," a group of four one-act 
plays, is translated from the German by Miss Grace 
Frank, and published by the Messrs. Scribner. The 
titles of the plays (in translation) are " Streaks of 
Light," " Margot," " The Last Visit," and " The Far- 
away Princess." 

A new edition of that practical and valuable work, 
" Punishment and Reformation," by Dr. Frederick 
Howard Wines, is published by the Messrs. Crowell in 
their " Library of Economics and Politics." The book 
is provided with much new material, and is brought 
thoroughly up to date. 

Mrs. Demetra Vaka Brown, whose book on the life 
of Turkish women, " Haremlik," was one of the import- 
ant books of last year, has written in collaboration with 
her husband, Kenneth Brown, a novel which will appear 
this month. It deals in an unusual way with the subject 
of international marriages. 

A handsome edition of " Pope's Rape of the Lock," 
with three portraits in photogravure, is published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde. The editor is Mr. George Holden, 
who contributes an elaborate historical and critical in- 
troduction, and supplies the other apparatus that prop- 
erly goes with such an annotated edition. 

A capital book for children is provided by the 
" Stories from Old Chronicles," which Miss Kate Ste- 
phens has put into simple narrative form in a volume 
published by the Sturgis & Walton Co. The selection 



begins with King Lear and ends with the Princes in the 
Tower. The editor has drawn from many sources, 
such as Asser, Holinshed, Froissart, and Malory, and 
made a collection that should prove very seductive to 
any child of unperverted taste. 

Mr. Maurice Hewlett's new novel, " Rest Harrow," 
now running in Scribner's Magazine," tells more about 
the life history of Senhouse, the painter and vagabond, 
who is Mr. Hewlett's most successful character, and 
the hero of " Halfway House " and " Open Country." 
Later in the year, " Rest Harrow " will be published in 
book form. 

Messrs. Hinds, Noble, & Eldridge publish a volume 
entitled " Intercollegiate Debates," which is made up 
of briefs and reports of actual disputations held during 
the past twelvemonth. There are twenty-five subjects 
in all, each provided with a list of references. A long 
list of other subjects fitted for academic use is given in 
an appendix. 

An interesting literary announcement is that of a col- 
lection of " Letters of John Stuart Mill," edited with 
an introduction by Mr. Hugh Elliott. The letters 
cover the period from 1829, when Mill began his 
" Logic," to his death in 1873, and are written to a 
number of the most interesting personalities of the day, 
both in France and England. 

" The Kulturkampf " is a historical monograph by 
the late Gordon Boyce Thompson of the University of 
Toronto, and is published by the Macmillan Co. (of 
Canada). The author died before his researches were 
completed, and the work is not all that he intended it 
to be, but his former associates have thought it deserv- 
ing of publication, although far from complete. 

The new edition of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's " New 
History of Painting in Italy from the II. to the XVI. 
Century," as revised by Mr. Edward Hutton, is now 
completed by the publication of the third volume, de- 
voted to the Florentine, Umbrian, and Sienese schools 
of the fifteenth century. This volume, like its fellows, 
is beautifully printed and richly illustrated. Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. are the publishers. 

Mr. Clinton Scollard, the well-known poet, and Mr. 
Thomas S. Jones Jr., one of our younger writers whose 
verse we have had occasion to commend, are about to 
issue together a volume of lyrics and sonnets with the 
title " From the Heart of the Hills " — a title referring 
to the New York hill country in which the authors 
live. The edition will be elegantly printed and 
bound, and will bear the imprint of Geo. W. Browning, 
Clinton, N. Y. 

In good season for Lincoln's birthday, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. will publish a small volume from the 
pen of Hon. Isaac N. Phillips, reporter for the Supreme 
Court of Illinois, which embodies an analysis of Lin- 
coln's character in a distinctly original manner. The 
same firm also announces a volume entitled " Abraham 
Lincoln: The Tribute of a Century," comprising the 
best of the many addresses on Lincoln delivered 
throughout the country on the occasion of last year's 
celebration of the centenary of Lincoln's birth. 

The February " Century " contains many apprecia- 
tions of its late editor, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, 
with consideration of various phases of Mr. Gilder's 
public activities, by George E. Woodberry, Henry 
van Dyke, Jacob A. Riis, Cecilia Beaux, and Robert 
Underwood Johnson; and tributes by President Taft, 
Ambassador Bryce, John Burroughs, Andrew Carnegie,

Helen Keller, and many others, who knew and loved 
the man. There is also a reproduction of the portrait 
painting by Cecilia Beaux, and of Mr. Gilder's last 
serious poem, " Love in a City." The announcement is 
definitely made that Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, 
who has long shared with Mr. Gilder the editorial 
responsibility of " The Century," now becomes the chief 
editor. Mr. Johnson is a capable and experienced man, 
and the interests of the magazine are not likely to suffer 
in his hands. 

The " Librarian's Series," of which the first number 
is noticed in another column of this issue, will include, 
besides " The Old Librarian's Almanack," " The Rev. 
John Sharpe and his Proposal for a Pubbck Library at 
New York, 1713," by Mr. Austin Baxter Keep; "The

Published Prior to 1800," being an annotated list com- 
piled by Miss Beatrice Winser; " The Hoax Concerning 
the Burning of the Alexandrian Library," by Joseph 
Octave Delepierre, 1860-61, and translated and anno- 
tated by Mr. George Parker Winship ; and " The Early 
History of Libraries," by the late Karl Dziatzko, libra- 
rian of Gottingen LTniversity, and translated by Mr. 
Edward Harmon Virgin. The subscription price for 
the six numbers is five dollars. Mr. John Cotton Dana 
and Mr. Henry W. Kent edit the series, which is pub- 
lished by the Elm Tree Press, Woodstock, Vermont. 

Among Matthew Arnold's odd comments on this 
country, after his memorable visit here a few years 
before his death, is a remark (referring to the New York 
"Evening Post") about a paper "written by Godkin, 
an expatriated Anglo-Irishman." This queer conception 
of a journal " written " by its editor is carried out 
quite literally in " The Forerunner " of Mrs. Charlotte 
Perkins Gilman, the third monthly issue of which is 
before us. It is written from beginning to end by its 
editor, who is also publisher and business manager, — 
not improbably compositor and bookkeeper as well. 
Editorials, notes, comments, even stories and poems, 
are all from her ready and versatile pen. For the first 
time in her life, says Mrs. Gilman, she is able to print 
such of her writings as she wishes to, and not such as 
editors will let her print. To one of her ardent and 
vital temperament, this must be a joy indeed, and we 
hope it will be one forever. Mrs. Gilman is a forceful 
and stimulating writer, with plenty of convictions and 
no lack of courage for them. No one is likely to fail 
of getting a full dollar's worth, who sends that amount 
for a year's subscription to " The Forerunner," 67 Wall 
Street, New York.

Each For All and All For Each 



By JOHN PARSONS, D.D. 



This volume is designed to meet the need for a convenient reference book, for the 
general reader especially, on the social questions of the day — a volume with indexes to 
every phase of the subject embraced in its limited space, and making systematic applica- 
tion of its principles. 

It is not a scientific treatise on sociology, but it applies the results reached by science 
to a mass of questions in education, industry, philanthrophy, government, and religion.

CVERY publisher of worth-while 
books knows the importance of 
library orders. Indeed, the financial 
success of many books depends wholly 
upon whether or not they are bought 
by libraries. And in any advertising 
campaign the wise publisher gives 
the librarian a very prominent place 
in his calculations. 



/^NE of the largest libraries in this 
country is the Newberry of 
Chicago. Its librarian said recently : 
"I always read The Dial pencil in 
hand, for it is now my habit to read 
for two — myself and the Newberry 
Library." Practically every librarian 
of importance in America reads The 
Dial, and reads it in that way — pencil 
in band, marking items for purchase.

ZITHER journals reach librarians, in 
some degree ; but no other exer- 
cises the same direct and personal 
influence with them. This fact alone 
gives The Dial a position apart from 
any other book medium, — makes it,

this story with painstaking elaboration of detail, with admirable discretion and taste, and with a judicial impartiality 
worthy of the highest commendation. As an exhaustive and philosophical exposition of the causes which led to the 
ultimate extinction of the Spanish empire in the Western Hemisphere, and as a large and authoritative contribution to the

The Glory of His Country 

By FREDERICK LANDIS 
$1.50. 

A striking and moving story of patriotism and self- 
sacrifice in the Civil War — a tale of deep and true quality 
and profound power. 

The kindly, friendly picture of HaDpyville, in Indiana, 
the simple, restrained, and charming love-story of the hero 
of the tale with an altogether delightful girl, the fresh, 
sympathetic description of the country and the out-of-doors, 
make a background for a tremendous drama of suffering, 
devotion, and endurance.

A Story of 
New York Life 

By STEPHEN FRENCH WHJTMAN $1.50. 

This, one of the most striking novels that has appeared 
in a long time, deals with the effect upon a young man beset 
with temptations, of an unfortunate inheritance. His love 
affairs, his efforts to establish himself, first in journalism 
and later in authorship, his varied and dramatic expe- 
riences and his friendships and acquaintances, are set forth 
with extraordinary psychological insight and a wealth of 
vivid detail. The unexpectedness of the denouement and 
its clarifying effect on the life drama that has been unfolded 
testify to the finished literary skill which Mr. Whitman 
brings to his task.

THE CROSSWAYS 

By Helen R. Mabtlx, author of " Tillie: A Mennonite Maid," etc. 
An unusual and powerful story, turning on the tragedy involved in the marriage of a charming, cultured 
Southern girl and a man of the Pennsylvania Dutch — the man, in spite of his university and professional 
polish and culture, blinded to the higher things of life and to the spiritual beauties and joys of marriage 
and home building by love of money for money's sake, and a belief, bred into the very marrow, of 
woman's inferiority. The scenes are set among the Pennsylvania Dutch of the husband's early home; 
and the humor and charm and dramatic power of Mrs. Martin's telling carry the reader to a strongly 
dramatic and satisfying climax. 31.50.

BJORNSTJERNE BJORNSON. 



The time is fast approaching when the twen- 
tieth century will have to produce its own great 
writers. The ranks of the surviving nineteenth- 
century veterans are rapidly thinning, and of 
their intellectual leaders few remain. To con- 
sider the giants only, the men of immensely 
resonant voice, we have recently had to mourn 
the loss of Carducci and of Ibsen, still more 
recently of Swinburne and Meredith ; and now 
the vigorous personality of Bjornson is likely 
to exist henceforth only in the books that are 
the transcript of his life. When he and his 
great compeer Tolstoy shall pass, the slate will 
be wiped clean. It seems more than likely 
that we shall then realize the reverse of Emer- 
son's aphorism, " When half-gods go, the gods 
arrive," and look in vain for the lineaments of 
authentic divinity in the faces of those among 
the living who seek to fill the places of the 
great departed. 

The capricious distribution of genius among 
men has never been more strikingly illustrated 
than by the fact that one of the smallest of 
nationalities has given to the modern world two 
of its most dominant literary personalities. 
Which of the two was the greater, may not 
now be determined. Against the supremacy of 
Ibsen's dramatic technique, and the trenchancy 
of his social surgery, we must put the far wider 
range of Bjornson, his more comprehensive 
sympathies, and his more vital and impressive 
individuality. The balance has seemed of late 
years to incline in the favor of the former ; but 
we are disposed to believe that in the eventual 
adjustment the latter will tip the scale. Bjorn- 
son has not yet been adequately presented to 
the English-speaking public. We know him as 
a novelist only, imperfectly as a dramatist, and 
hardly at all as a lyrist. As the singer pure 
and simple, his native idiom (as with all lyric 
poets) opposes an impassable barrier to foreign 
understanding ; as a dramatist, he has not yet 
come to his own in other countries than his own ; 
his international fame rests at present upon his 
tales — the naive idylls of his earlier years, and 
the later work freighted with the deepest soul- 
concerns of the modern man — and, in a lesser 



108

[Feb. 16, 



measure, upon his identification with many of the 
political and social movements of his time. 

Bjbrnstjerne Bjornson was born at Kvikne, 
December 8, 1832, — four years after Ibsen. 
He was sprung from hardy peasant stock, and 
his childhood was passed in one of the wildest 
and most picturesque parts of Norway, the 
legend-haunted region of the Romsdal and the 
Dovref jeld. He was educated at the University 
of Christiania, and his first book was published 
in 1857, when he was completing his twenty- 
fifth year. That book was " Synnbve Solbakken," 
and it was truly epoch-making, for it was the 
beginning of a new literature, fresh from the 
soil and untrammelled by academic or alien in- 
fluences, for his native country. The following 
fifteen years were richly fruitful, and made him 
the foremost figure in the national life. They 
were the years that produced " Arne," " En Glad 
Gut," and " Fiskerjenten," which form with 
" Synnbve " the famous group of peasant idylls ; 
the years in which the great saga-dramas were 
written, including "Sigurd Slembe," "Sigurd 
Jorsalfar," and " Kong Sverre," and the years 
in which his songs found their way to the hearts 
of the Norwegian people as no songs had ever 
reached them before. During this period he also 
produced his one long poem, " Arnljot Gelline," 
an epic cycle of the clash between heathendom 
and the Christian faith, his " Mary Stuart i Skot- 
land," and the first of the social plays that were 
to represent so large a part of the activity of his 
later years. 

Bjornson had all these things to his credit 
before he had reached the age of forty. He had 
become the voice of his people, the incarnation 
of all that was best and deepest in the national 
life of Norway. It seemed hardly possible for 
a man to achieve greater fame, yet in the early 
seventies a new Bjornson took the field, with a 
vastly broadened outlook, and a new power to 
compel attention. He had been reading widely 
and to effective purpose ; he had plunged into 
the mid-current of advancing thought ; he had 
acquired the full spiritual franchise of the 
modern European. No longer bound by the 
fetters of a narrow orthodoxy in religion, or of 
the provincial spirit in politics, he had raised 
himself to a more commanding plane, not indeed 
of creative art but of intellectual power. His 
work from this time on was to be the vehicle of 
a message, the result of an imperious mandate 
to enlist in the world-wide struggle for the eman- 
cipation of the body and the soul of man. 

Like his most famous fellow-worker in this 
struggle, he found in dramatic composition his 



most effective weapon. During the last thirty- 
five years of his life he produced upwards of a 
dozen social dramas, providing a series of object- 
lessons no less impressive than those which Ibsen 
was providing during the same period and by the 
same agency. The first of these plays were 
" Redaktbren " (The Editor) and " En Fallit " 
(A Bankruptcy), preceding by two years the 
first of Ibsen's modern series. The former of 
the two is a fierce satire upon modern journal- 
ism ; the latter, a trenchant discussion of the 
ethics of business life. " En Hanske M (A 
Glove) is perhaps the most contentious of these 
modern plays ; it has for its theme the double 
standard of sexual morality. The two plays 
linked by the common title of " Over ^vne " 
(Beyond the Strength) are singularly powerful 
and appealing. One is religious in theme, and 
the other social ; but the teaching of both is to 
the effect that much of the best human energy 
goes to waste because it attempts to realize im- 
possible ideals. The greatest of all these modern 
plays is " Kongen " (The King), a study of the 
institution of monarchy, and an implicit demon- 
stration of its anachronistic character. Why 
this work, to say nothing of others, has failed to 
find its way to our English stage, is a matter 
that passes comprehension. 

During these years of dramatic fecundity, 
the pen of the novelist was by no means idle. 
Half a dozen works of fiction, including two of 
major importance, have appeared from time 
to time, offering as striking a contrast to the 
peasant idylls as the modern plays offer to 
the saga-dramas. We do not know which is 
the more marvellous : that " Arne " and " Det 
Flager " should have been written by the same 
hand, or that " Sigurd Slembe " and " Kongen " 
should have been brought forth by the same 
mind. "Det Flager i Byen og paa Havnen " 
(Flags are Flying in City and Harbor) is a 
work of fiction in a qualified sense only. It 
is of the lineage of " Emile " and " Wilhelm 
Meister," and is at once a study in heredity 
and an exposition of educational ideals. " Paa 
Guds Veje " (In God's Ways) is a work so noble 
and rich and beautiful that it beggars critical 
appraisement. With its delicate and vital de- 
lineations of character, its rich sympathy and 
depth of tragic pathos, its plea for the sacred- 
ness of human life and its protest against the 
religious and social prejudice by which life is so 
often misshapen, this book is an epitome of all 
the ideas and feelings that have gone to the 
making of the author's personality and have 
received such manifold expression in his works. 



1910.] 



THE DIAL. 



109 



This is the book that illustrates Bjornson's 
genius in its ripe fruitage, as its rich early flow- 
ering was illustrated by " Arne " and " Sigurd 
Slembe " and the lyrics. 

When we remember that besides his triple 
distinction as novelist, dramatist, and poet, 
BjornsoD has served the public in many other 
capacities, we begin to realize how great a figure 
is fading into the past. He has been the 
director of three theatres, the editor of three 
newspapers, the promoter of schools and patri- 
otic organizations, the participant in many politi- 
cal campaigns, the lay preacher of private and 
public morals, and the chosen orator of his 
nation for all great occasions. When one com- 
pares him with Ibsen in such respects as these, 
the contrast is as great, let us say, as that 
between Henri Quatre at Ivry and Phillip II. 
in the Escorial. In private life also he was as 
ebullient and genial as his famous compeer was 
self-centred and reserved. When so magnifi- 
cent a personality as his disappears from among 
men, the most skeptical may wonder if there be 
not some kernel of transcendental truth in 
Arnold's verses : 

" O strong soul, by what shore 
Tarriest thou now ? For that force, 
Surely, has not been left vain! 
Somewhere, surely, afar, 
In the sounding labour-house vast 
Of being, is practised that strength, 
Zealous, beneficent, firm." 

Sometime in the seventies, when the first of 
his two periods was ended, Bjornson became a 
country farmer at Aulestad in the Gausdal, 
where he purchased an estate and led a patri- 
archal life, bestowing hospitable welcome upon 
the guests that thronged to him from many 
lands. Most of his winters, however, were 
spent abroad, in Munich, Rome, or Paris ; and 
one of them (1880-81) was spent in those 
parts of the United States where Norwegians 
most abound. We have precious memories of 
his brief sojourn in Chicago — of the eloquence 
with which he addressed an afternoon audience 
in MeVicker's Theatre, and of the rare evening 
of informal converse when a few of his friends 
in this far-off country were taken into the privi- 
lege of his intimate companionship. 



It is good news that Mr. Sidney Colvin is preparing 
a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's Letters. The 
whole correspondence will be incorporated in one work, 
and there will be additions. Many of Stevenson's best 
letters are still in manuscript; but the reasons which 
have postponed their publication are disappearing. 



THE CENTENARY OF AMERICA'S 
FIRST NOV ELIST. 

A hundred years ago, on the 22d of this month 
of February, there died in Philadelphia the first 
American novelist, who was also a pioneer American 
journalist, Charles Brockden Brown. He had won 
neither fame nor worldly success, and his passing 
attracted scarcely any attention among his contem- 
poraries. His name has gradually become familiar 
to students of literature, but his personality is still 
veiled in shadow. Until a recent date his unmarked 
grave in Friends' Burial Ground could not be accu- 
rately known. Two surveys of his writings appeared 
in Blackwood's journals, in 1820 and 1824, in which 
the English reviewers expressed just, if somewhat 
exaggerated, reproach toward Americans for their 
indifference to the work and memory of this man 
who blazed the way for later American romancers, 
and encouraged and practised, at great self-sacrifice, 
the cultivation of literature as a life-work. 

The main incidents of Brown's life, as given in 
disjointed form by his friend and counsellor, William 
Dunlap, merely suggest his temperamental traits 
and the yearnings of his soul for sympathy and 
vital expression. With blended ancestry of Quakers 
and Normans, he had an alert mind and an unfet- 
tered fancy, with a physique that was ever frail. As 
a boy, he was precocious, over-sensitive, and rest- 
less ; as a man, he was introspective to a degree of 
morbidity, impelled by high ideals, and self-depre- 
ciatory because he failed to attain to his aspirations. 
He deferred to his father's wishes, and studied law ; 
but he decided that he must defy his family and 
venture all his hopes on literature, else he would 
prove traitor to his own mind and soul. From his 
Philadelphia home he went to New York, in 1797, 
to the home of Dr. Elihu Smith, where he passed 
through the tragic experiences of an attack of yel- 
low fever aud the loss of his host and best friend 
from the same disease. After a few months in the 
home of William Dunlap at Perth Amboy, Brown 
returned to Philadelphia to pass the rest of his life. 
In a manuscript letter to Dunlap (now in the His- 
torical Society of Pennsylvania), written a year 
after his return, we find allusions to his first efforts 
at novel-writing, under the stimulus of Dr. Smith, 
and also strong evidence of the morose moods which 
sometimes overwhelmed him. 

*' I think upon the life of last winter with self-loathing 
almost unsupportable. Alas, my friend, few consolations 
of a self -approving mind have fallen to my lot. ... I am 
sometimes apt to think that few hnman beings have drunk 
so deeply of the cup of self-abhorrence as I have. . . . 
Whether it will end but with my life, I know not." 

Below this letter is a significant note, signed "W. 
Dunlap," saying. " So at certain moments could 
think & write one of the purest, best-beloved of men." 
Brown's first book, ''Alcuin," was a dialogue- 
essay on the then novel subject of Equal Suffrage, 
which appeared as u Rights of Women " in a jour- 
nal with the cumbersome title, " Weekly Magazine

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



of Original Essays, Fugitive Pieces, and Interesting 
Intelligence," Vol. I. (Philadelphia, 1798). This 
argument on a subject of current discussion is inter- 
esting to-day, in spite of its diffuse and extravagant 
phrasing ; it reveals the progressive ideas and broad 
mental outlook which characterized Brown's later 
editorials and political pamphlets. The four novels 
by which he is classified in literature — " Wieland," 
" Ormond," " Arthur Mervyn," and " Edgar Hunt- 
ley " — appeared from the press within two years, 
although earlier versions of portions of two stories 
had appeared in New York journals. If the reader 
has patience to pass by their florid emotionalism 
and fantastic melodrama, he will discover a few 
realistic descriptions of American scenery and char- 
acter. The two later efforts at fiction, " Jane Tal- 
bot " and " Clara Howard," are amatory letters of 
a vapid type. Within the four representative novels 
are reflected certain fancies, superstitions, and men- 
tal hallucinations, which were rife among the masses 
of the American people at the close of the eighteenth 
century. Brown chose a few of these agitating and 
haunting suggestions as motives in his novels, — 
namely, ventriloquism, elixir of life, somnambulism, 
and the fearful memories of yellow fever and Indian 
forays. 

Brown's work as novelist ended when he was 
thirty ; it was the immature and disjointed product 
of a fertile fancy and zealous brain, eager to express 
original conceptions, yet hampered by the influence 
of English models by Godwin, Mrs. Radcliffe, and 
their kind. During the remaining nine years of his 
life, Brown was a hard-working, aspiring journalist, 
undaunted in spirit and in a determination to increase 
the knowledge and widen the tastes of the American 
public. Relatively, his journalistic experiments had 
titles longer than their subscription lists ; yet they 
won a moderate patronage, and exerted, indirectly, 
a far-reaching influence for the appreciation of world- 
literature of all forms among a people who were 
sadly provincial. 

A lack of humor was a great drawback to Brown's 
happiness in life, and a defect in his literary work. 
His seriousness and melancholy were doubtless 
reactionary symptoms from his physical weakness. 
He longed, in verbose phrase, for "that lightness 
and vivacity of mind which the divine flow of 
health, even in calamity, produces in some men." 
While the last years of his life were weakened by 
anaemia and tuberculosis, yet his mental and emo- 
tional faculties were stimulated by a happy marriage 
to Miss Elizabeth Linn, and the mingled joys and 
anxieties of parenthood. A manuscript letter to his 
wife, June 17, 1806, written from Albany (Library 
of Historical Society of Pennsylvania), shows a 
cheerful mood and a deep love for his family. A 
single sentence is a good example of his typical 
labored form, which might have been simplified by 
a sense of humor : " You confirm my prognostics 
that the lovely babes will scamper about house, by 
the time of my return." To the closing day of his 
life, he maintained a marvellous activity of mind and 



pen, and tried to soften the approaching sorrow for 
his family by an unfailing courage and a tender 
consideration for them. 

A deep and pervasive loyalty to his country, and 
faith in her political supremacy and intellectual 
awakening, were cherished in the heart of America's 
first novelist and expressed in varied forms in his 
writings. Washington Irving acknowledged his debt 
to Brown for inspiration to persist in literary en- 
deavors to widen the tastes and mental horizon of 
America. Brown could not combine his fantasies 
and realistic scenes into an artistic product ; his con- 
struction was weak, and his portrayals, with few 
exceptions, were ineffective. He was, however, con- 
stantly aspiring to combine the visionary with the 
realistic, and his life was noble and productive in 
spite of many blighting influences. He wrote occa- 
sional verse, generally a bit of rhapsodic musing, like 
this stanza from a manuscript poem, " L' Amoroso," 
presented by his son to Frank M. Etting, and now 
in the Boston Public Library. 

" From pleasure's walks and market-places ; 

Stilly Groves and lonely Hills ; 
From gay carousals, thronging faces, 

Moonlight Glades and warbling rills ; 
From fighting fields and stormy Seas ; 

From courtly pomp and war's array ; 
From State turmoils and letter'd Ease ; 

Come, my enamoured Soul, away ! 
From haunts that moonstruck Fancy wooes, 

Where Nymphs resort, and Muses roam, 
From all that vulgar dreams abuse, 

Come home, Ecstatic Thought, come home ! " 

Annie Russell Marble. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The late Edouard Rod, whose novels have a 
considerable circulation outside his own country, and 
whose lectures in America about ten years ago can- 
not yet have been forgotten, is the subject of a re- 
cent appreciative essay from the pen of M. Henri 
Chantoine, which, though written before Rod's 
death, serves well as an obituary tribute. The moral 
earnestness of his work is commended, while his 
skill and his charm as a story-teller are not lost sight 
of. Rod, concludes the essay, " never tarries too 
long over psychological subtleties, never wearies us 
with lengthy descriptions, never loses sight of essen- 
tials in his care for detail. His aim is to depict 
character in its battle with realities ; individual life 
in its most sorrowful, most hidden, inner experience; 
social existence as it envelopes and excites and 
crushes the individual. The framework of his novels 
is always solid, without being heavy ; the movement 
of the action is dramatic, without being breathless 
or capricious ; the form is severe and condensed, 
dispensing with false ornament. He writes calmly 
and deliberately, as one convinced of the truth of 
what he is saying. You feel that Rod has lived 
long with his subject and his characters before put- 
ting them on paper." His principal works since the

Mb. Sanborn's estimate of the Emerson 
Journals was delivered in no uncertain tones at a 
recent meeting of the Emerson Society in the Bos- 
ton Public Library, where he read a paper on his 
illustrious fellow-townsman, paying especial atten- 
tion to the opening volumes of Journals and Letters 
that have recently appeared. " The most important 
publication in America during the year just closed " 
was his opinion of the work, because it displayed 
the youth and development of the greatest of 
American men of letters, and because for the first 
time it enabled his readers and critics to speak in- 
telligently of his early readings and meditations and 
all the influences promoting the growth of his genius. 
Going still further, Mr. Sanborn affirmed that " the 
nearest approach that any American has made to 
the universality of Shakespeare's mind is found in 
the wide reach and easy elevation of Emerson." 
The early maturity of Emerson's thought and the 
wide range of his youthful studies were noted, as 
also his quick sense of affinity for Plato, his skill, at 
eighteen, in turning the Spenserian stanza, and his 
facility in writing Latin. A significant utterance 
of Emerson's was quoted in closing. When asked 
by Elizabeth Peabody what effect it would have had 
on his education if his father had remained in the 
small rural parish of Harvard, where he first set- 
tled, he answered : " Very little ; nature was there, 
and books." " But how if your Aunt Mary had not 
lived in your mother's Boston family after your 
father's death, and .concerned herself with your 
education ? " " Ah, that would have been a loss ; I 
could have better spared Greece and Rome." 

The charm of mtths and superstitions, those 
graceful fabrications founded on poetry and romance 
and wonder, is so great that no amount of scientific 
and historic demonstration of their untenability will 
ever succeed in suppressing them. In vain does 
the ruthless myth-demolisher assure us that Dick 
Whittington's cat is a fabulous animal, that William 
Tell did not pierce the core of an apple with his arrow 
as the said fruit rested on the head of his little son, 
and that Lady Godiva never made that noonday pas- 
sage on horseback through the streets of Coventry, 
with only her golden tresses to veil her loveliness. 
Someone has tried to shiver to fragments Cinderella's 
dainty little glass slippers, by alleging that in the 
original Eastern version of the tale the footgear in 
question is of fur, and that our rendering of the 
French translation (pantoufles en vair) has stupidly 
given us glass slippers (pantoufles en verre) by a 
confusion of two French words pronounced nearly 
alike. To be sure, fur slippers would be more 



comfortable for dancing, unless we can imagine the 
spinning of glass to have attained perfection in 
Cinderella's time. But that is of small moment, and 
glass the slippers will remain for English-speaking 
children. Another baseless myth, if we are to 
believe the unsympathetic and unimaginative mete- 
orologist, lies behind the confident assertion of every 
adult inhabitant of New England, and perhaps of all 
our Northern States, that the winters of our boyhood 
were of a severity now unknown, and that Whit- 
tier's 6 Snow-Bound " pictures December rigors 
and delights not vouchsafed to this degenerate age. 
Mythoclasts, like iconoclasts, are an odious tribe ; 
and their destructive endeavors will little avail them. 
There may have been brave men before Agamemnon, 
but he will maintain his superiority to those that have 
come after him. 

Minnesota's contributions to literature are 
more considerable than one might expect from a 
State still so young, and of so small a population 
compared with her older sisters. In " Library Notes 
and News," issued by the Minnesota Public Library 
Commission, there was published a year ago a list 
of Minnesota authors and their works, followed a 
few months later by large additions. A writer in 
the December number of the above-named publica- 
tion calls attention to the handsome showing of these 
combined lists, which give " an enrollment of about 
four hundred Minnesota authors, with nearly one 
thousand titles of books." About a hundred maga- 
zine writers are to be added to these, with some five 
hundred important articles to their credit. Count- 
ing also the many society publications and official 
documents from Minnesota pens — all of which are 
being collected and preserved by the State Histori- 
cal Society — we have probably not fewer than a 
thousand names of writers and several thousand 
titles of books and pamphlets and articles and re- 
ports. Which proves that something besides flour 
is produced in the State that gave us, indirectly and 
by inspiration, the picture of Minnehaha and " The 
Song of Hiawatha." 

Aggressive library methods — aggressive in 
the sense of progressive — are manifest in some sec- 
tions of the country, and in some libraries, and not 
so manifest in others. The never somnolent Los 
Angeles Public Library makes active warfare on the 
non-reading and non-library-using members of its 
community. Thousands of copies of a rousing letter 
have been sent out by the librarian to persons in all 
walks of business life — twenty-five hundred to rail- 
way employees alone. One of its paragraphs reads 
thus : " This library has things which would be use- 
ful to you in your business. Anything it has n't 
now, and that may be of use to you, it will be glad 
to get and put at your service." That should prove 
irresistible. Supposing a recipient of this letter dis- 
covers that it would be useful to him in his business 
to have a copy of the " Periegesis " of Pausanias, or 
the " De Re Rustica " of Varro, or a new cash 
register of Dayton manufacture ; all he has to do is

A maker of future librarians has been found 
in the new director of the Drexel Institute Library 
School at Philadelphia, — Miss June Richardson 
Donnelly, apparently a not unworthy successor to 
the late Alice B. Kroeger, whose bright, alert, and 
always cordially sympathetic personality will be 
remembered by all who knew her. A love of fun, 
too, was hers in full measure ; and her successor, 
Miss Donnelly, is said to be nowise deficient in 
humor. From " Public Libraries " we copy the fol- 
lowing personal paragraph, written by the director 
of Simmons College Library School, where Miss 
Donnelly is at present engaged : " She is liked and 
respected by both the students and her fellow- 
instructors, for she has dignity, tact, and an interest 
in a variety of things, with the saving grace of a 
keen sense of humor. In the class-room Miss 
Donnelly has been very successful. She presents 
her subjects logically, with a due sense of proportion, 
and in a clear, interesting manner." One is glad 
to read of the new Director, that with all her good 
qualities she has both humor and a sense of pro- 
portion — which may save her pupils from the not 
unknown fate of taking themselves too seriously.

The crowded book-season, lately passed, but 
soon to begin again with the spring freshets, pre- 
sents so strong a contrast to the slack summer 
months, when the stream of literature trickles with 
the diminished volume of a mountain brook in Au- 
gust, that the thought must have occurred to many 
readers, Why not equalize the issue of books and 
make every season alike significant in the pro- 
duction of important works ? This alternation of 
dearth and superabundance has its obvious disad- 
vantages. A recent number of the London " Athe- 
naeum " (which, by the way, has at last, in its eighty- 
third year, added to the book reviews that have 
hitherto comprised its principal contents the desir- 
able feature of a leading article of general literary 
interest) advocates this more equal distribution of 
book-production throughout the four seasons. Book- 
publishers and book-reviewers certainly, and book- 
buyers and book-readers probably, would cast a 
majority vote for the reform.

The persistence of Gladstone's influence in 
England is attested, more convincingly than by any 
centennial eulogies, by the large sales of Morley's 
life of the great statesman. From London comes 
the report that a hundred and thirty thousand copies 
of the book, in its three successive editions, ranging 
from two guineas to five shillings each, have been 
sold ; and the end is not yet. The length of the 
work (800,000 words) and "the nature of its contents 



make it no light undertaking to read it through, so 
that the record of its circulation becomes impressive 
indeed. Of course distinguished authorship counts 
for considerable, though probably for far less than 
in certain other departments of literature, as in fic- 
tion or poetry. But when all is said, Gladstone 
made on his countrymen, of whatever rank or 
station, an impression so deep and lasting that his 
biography will not soon cease to find willing pur- 
chasers and eager readers. 

The limit of Baconian madness has now been 
reached in the foolish enterprise of two Americans 
in exploring the caves at the foot of the cliffs on 
which stand the eleventh-century ruins of Chepstow 
Castle, in Monmouthshire. Imagining they have 
found in Bacon's writings a clue to the hiding-place 
where his library was deposited, together with much 
documentary evidence to establish his authorship of 
Shakespeare's plays, and to upset Elizabethan his- 
tory generally, these enthusiastic Baconians have 
obtained exclusive rights (so it is reported) to the 
thorough searching of this mare's nest ; and, though 
forced to suspend their fruitless labors for a time 
and return to this country, they declare their intention 
to return and resume the undertaking. As a piece of 
friendly counsel we would advise them to save their 
travelling expenses by digging and delving in their 
own cellars ; they would get the exercise and arrive 
at equally satisfying results.

Emerson in France is still winning new ad- 
mirers. The latest proof of this takes the form of a 
French translation of his choicest passages for a vol- 
ume of " Pages Choisies " compiled by Mile. Marie 
Dugard, the mistress of a young ladies' "Lycee" 
at Passy. Mr. Frank B. Sanborn is said to have 
signified his cordial approval of these gallicized ex- 
tracts from his fellow-townsman's writings, and also 
of the new French version of " The Conduct of Life " 
which the same appreciative translator has issued, 
prefixed with a part of Carlyle's cordial letter to 
his Concord friend, in which he hails the " philosphy 
that hardly three men have dreamed of." Thus 
there are not wanting signs, both at home (where 
the "Journals" are now conspicuous in the book 
market) and abroad, that the Emersonian revival 
of seven years ago (the centennial year) did not 
exhaust the world's enthusiasm for our great trans- 
cendentalism

THE CHARM OF INDIVIDUAL SPELLING. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
A system of individual spelling — " every man for 
himself " — would seem to be the logical outcome of the 
" spelling-reform" movement; but it is a little startling to 
find such a system openly advocated by a distinguished 
professor, who, if he is correctly reported, recently told 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



113 



the students of Columbia University that " Much would 
be achieved if scholars of renown, philologists, students 
of literature, and writers of books in general, would 
indulge in some individual spellings. These need not 
be necessarily consistent, and the author need not give 
any other reason for his special heterodoxies than that 
they just suit his fancy." That men are to be found 
who are ready to live up to these counsels of literary 
anarchy, appears from some charming sentences culled 
from an address by one who is described as " a professor 
in one of our technical schools": 

" Liv for the realization of hy ideals. 

'• He shoud hav abstaind from reviling 1 the faricees. 

•• A man brings out . . . quaint litl pearls in her soul 
that she herself never dremt of. 

"So are man's enrage and generosity dubld and tripld 
thru a woman's presence." 

As a writer in " The Nation " lately pointed out, 
" one natural result of the agitation in favor of so-called 
' simplified spelling ' would be a tendency, on the part 
of the careless, inaccurate, and anarchical, to be more 
lawless, inaccurate, and indifferent still as to spelling 
in general. Such a tendency would be shown in many 
places, one of them obviously being the classroom." 
A timely illustration of the way the tendency is shown 
in classrooms comes from Iowa, where a college pro- 
fessor has compiled from examination papers of his 
students a list of 160 misspelled words. Presumably, 
these counted against the students in their markings. 
But why should they? Why should not students, as 
well as professors, exercise the right — the duty, even — 
of " individual spelling " ? This is a free country, and a 
student has as much right as anyone else to use spell- 
ings that " just suit his fancy."

THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE MALONE SOCIETY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

It will be of interest, I think, to many of your 
readers to know that the Malone Society, of England, 
intends to close its subscription list on March 20, and 
that all who wish to become members of the Society 
and secure the valuable publications which it is issuing 
must apply before that date to the Honorary Secretary 
of the Society, Arundel Esdaile, Esq., The British 
Museum, London. 

The Society was founded for the purpose of printing 
texts of early English plays, and documents and notes 
illustrative of the history of the English stage and 
drama. During the first two years of its existence it 
issued twelve volumes, ten plays, and two volumes of 
collections consisting of fragments of plays and valuable 
documents and notes; and a further set of six volumes 
is in preparation for the current year. As the Society 
was not organized for profit, but for the benefit of the 
members, the number of volumes issued will depend 
upon the funds available from membership fees. It has 
now 215 members, and should have many more, as the 
annual subscription is only one guinea. 

The plays are not facsimiles, but exact reprints of 
the originals, executed under the supervision of Mr. 
W. W. Greg as general editor, whose name, with those 
of E. K. Chambers, the President of the Society, and 
A. W. Pollard, the Honorary Treasurer, will assure 
those who have not seen the volumes of the scholarly 
accuracy with which the reprints are made. The com- 



position and press-work has been done by the Chiswick 
Press and the Clarendon Press, and the volumes are 
notably fine examples of bookmaking. All persons who 
are interested in the history of the drama in England 
should avail themselves of the opportunity to become 
members of the Society before the subscription list is 
closed. 

As the time is short, I shall be glad to answer any 
questions which intending subscribers may wish to ask 
in regard to the Society. John M. Manly.

A NOTE ON SHELLEY'S "ADONAIS." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I believe that it has not been pointed out that the 
famous lines in the last stanza of " Adonais," — 
" My spirit's bark is driven 
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng 
Whose sails were never to the tempest given; 
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven ! 
I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar," — 
find an interesting parallel in the dying words of 
Vittoria in Webster's " White Devil,"— 

" My soul, like to a ship in a black storm, 
Is driven I know not whither." 

It is probable that the parallelism is accidental, though 
Shelley at the time (1821) was still revising "The Cenci" 
(1820; second edition, 1821). In this drama, as is well 
known, he drew largely on the Elizabethan plays for 
models. 

Both the passages cited, from " Adonais " and " The 

White Devti," are also interesting because they are 

modifications of one of the most frequently used conceits 

of the sonneteers. Petrarch ("Vita," exxxvii.) wrote: 

" Passa la nave mia colma d' obblio 

Per aspro mare a mezza notte il verno. . . . 

Tal ch' incomincio a disperar del porto." 

Of the many imitations of this figure in the Elizabethan 
sonnet cycles, Spenser's ("Amoretti," xxxiv.) fits most 
nearly the present case: 

" Lyke as a ship, that through the Ocean wyde, 
By conduct of some star, doth make her way ; 
Whenas a storme hath dim'd her trusty guyde, 
Out of her course doth wander far astray ! 
So I, whose star, that wont with her bright ray 
Me to direct, with cloudes is overcast, 
Doe wander now, in darknesse and dismay, 
Through hidden perils round about me plast ; 
Yet hope I well that, when this storme is past, 
My Helice, the lodestar of my lyfe, 
Will shine again, and looke on me at last." 

The complaint of Britomart (F. Q. LEI., iv., 8 and 9) is 
a free adaptation of the same idea, and the parallel in 
" Adonais " is made the more striking by the concluding 
thought that 

'' The soul of Adonais, like a star, 
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are." 

In one of Shelley's letters to Mrs. Gisborne, dated 
from Florence, November, 1819, there is still another 
echo of the familiar Elizabethan conceit: 

" Madonna — I have been lately voyaging in a sea without 
my pilot, and although my sail has often been torn, my boat 
become leaky, and the log lost, I have yet sailed in a kind of 
way from island to island. ... I have been reading Calderon 
without you."

The Authorized Biography of Richard 
Manseieed.* 



" I am your dramatic godson," said Richard 
Mansfield to his friend of twenty-five years' 
standing, Mr. William Winter. " I wonder if 
you would care to undertake a biography ? It 
might interest some persons, and much in my 
early life was strange. It should prove inter- 
esting. I think a book on the Life of R. M., 
from your pen, might sell well." And later, 
after being told that the book was planned and 
would be written : ** I am tremendously excited 
about your writing the Life of R. M. It is 
better than being knighted." 

Now at last, after the lapse of two years and 
a half since the brilliant actor's untimely death, 
appears Mr. Winter's " Life and Art of Rich- 
ard Mansfield," in two handsome and profusely- 
illustrated volumes. The long intimacy between 
the two men, the younger one's constant practice 
of seeking the advice and encouragement of his 
" dramatic godfather," their mutual sympathy 
in many of their ideals and enthusiasms, and the 
records, largely in the form of personal letters, 
in the biographer's possession, qualify him to 
write informingly and authoritatively of his 
actor-friend, and to correct many false notions 
about him that have been circulated by other 
pens — notably by that of Mr. Paul Wilstach, 
whose highly readable book, " Richard Mans- 
field, the Man and the Actor," has now been 
before the public for more than a year. Espe- 
cially unaccountable, in the light of Mr. Win- 
ter's volumes, is the other's assertion (at the 
end of the preface to his book) that " his [i. e., 
Mansfield's | letters, which would add to an 
acquaintance with him, were not many, except 
to his wife and son. To others he wrote in the 
main only brief notes of courtesy, for he had 
an aversion to telling anyone what he was go- 
ing to do, or to referring to what he had done." 
On the contrary, as shown by the many letters 
now reproduced, he was, if anything, too ready 
to enlarge, in grandiloquent fashion, on his own 
unparalleled achievements, past and prospective. 
For example, in an exultant outpouring to Mr. 
Winter, he writes, in the spring of 1890 : 

" I think everything is possible to me, if I am helped, 
and I feel, more and more, that the future — the imme- 
diate future — of the American stage lies very much in 
my hands. At all events, I intend laying violent hands

on it — coute que coute ! I have a most tempting offer 
to go to Berlin ; and I think I shall accept — because I 
can go there and do great things ' right off,' without 
question — and when I 've done them there it will appear 
natural to people here that I should do them." 

Mr. Winter is so much interested in the art of 
Richard Mansfield that he dwells very slightly 
on his life, apart from his movements in the 
pursuit of that fame which he so confidently 
expected to win. The early years in England 
and on the Continent are barely referred to ; 
but one question of some importance is decisively 
settled, and that is the birth-year of the preco- 
cious young man who startled theatrical circles 
in New York with his impersonation of Baron 
Chevrial in 1883. The commonly accepted date 
of his birth — the date, too, that is given in Mr. 
Wilstach's book — would make him but twenty- 
five years old at that time ; whereas, from his 
own written words, cited by Mr. Winter, it 
appears that he was in his twenty-ninth year, 
having been born in 1854. The first volume 
of the " Life and Art " follows Mansfield 
through the rapidly alternating vicissitudes of 
good and evil fortune, down to his death in the 
late summer of 1907 ; and, though much inci- 
dental comment and criticism are interspersed, 
the greater part of this sort of disquisition is 
reserved for the second volume, where each im- 
portant role of the versatile actor is taken up in 
proper order and treated in the well-known man- 
ner of the veteran dramatic critic, and certainly 
without undue prejudice in the performer's 
favor. The writer earnestly disclaims ever hav- 
ing allowed any favor of persons to influence 
his judgment or modify its candid expression. 

Son of an English father and a Russian 
mother (the Madame Erminia Rudersdorff of 
operatic fame), Richard Mansfield was so richly 
endowed with the artistic and bohemian tem- 
perament that anything like a peaceable, well- 
ordered, commonplace boyhood and youth was 
from the very outset an impossibility. His 
peculiar gift for misfitting his environment is 
reflected in some notes of his early life, written 
for Mr. Winter's use. He says, probably with 
considerable artistic intensifying of lights and 
shadows, especially of shadows : 

" Mine was a hard life when I was a child. Some- 
times I was scolded, sometimes beaten, and sometimes 
starved. Whatever I was meant to be, God knows it 
is not strange if I am what they call 'singular.' I 
sometimes think that the early wrench given to my 
mind by such treatment was the beginning of the sym- 
pathy I feel with such persons as Glo'ster and Chevrial. 
They are wicked, but they are courageous; they have 
seen the selfishness of the world, — and they go on. 
What they get they compel; the recognition they receive 
is for what they do for themselves; they are always

lonely ; they look through the motives of all around them, 
and no wonder they are cynical and cruel. There are times 
when I feel so barred out of the world, so hated, that 
if I could push down the pillars of the universe and smash 
everything and everybody, I 'd gladly do it ! " 

That one of so rebellious and stormy a dis- 
position, prone to regard the world as his enemy 
until friendship had been extorted by violence, 
should not have been loved by the public, even 
though the tribute of admiration could not be 
withheld, is not strange. It was a part of his 
character, and one of his methods of making his 
way in his difficult profession, to be aggressive 
and dictatorial, intolerant of stupidity and im- 
patient of restraint. Macready, Forrest, Kean, 
and scores of prominent actors and actresses 
besides, could be adduced as examples of this 
high-strung, uncompromising artistic tempera- 
ment. From the outset he seems to have been 
unable to work in harmony with associates, or 
on an equal footing with them. Whatever his 
part, he tended to fill the stage ; and there was 
no peace for him or anyone else until he had 
put himself at the head of a company and won 
the right to " boss the show." Wherever he 
sat was the head of the table — literally as well 
as figuratively, his uneasiness as a guest at 
another's board being notorious. Even with a 
professional rival so friendly and appreciative 
as Henry Irving he could not manage to remain 
on thoroughly good terms for any length of 
time. When he went to England, in 1888, at 
living's invitation and with the Lyceum placed 
at his disposal, it was not long before he imag- 
ined himself ill-treated by all and sundry with 
whom he came in contact. Mr. Winter writes : 

" The meeting was a delightful one. The relations 
between Mansfield and Irving were then friendly. They 
did not always remain so. They fluctuated considerably ; 
and although, at the last, the two men remained on osten- 
sibly amicable terms of social intercourse, the feeling 
existent between them was that of disapprobation on the 
part of Irving and antipathy on the part of Mansfield. 
It is necessary to allude to this subject, because those 
actors, eventually, became professionally opposed, and 
because circumstances in the stage career of Mansfield 
would otherwise remain unexplained. The subject, fur- 
thermore, is an essential part of theatrical history, — a 
record which should tell the truth, and not be encum- 
bered with sentimental eulogium and obscuration of 
facts. Mansfield had no reason to blame any one but 
himself for the loss of Henry Irving's active friendship. 
It was an infirmity of his mind that he ascribed every 
mishap, every untoward circumstance, every reverse of 
fortune, to some external, malign influence, — never to 
any accident, or any error of his judgment, or any ill- 
considered act or word, or any fault of his own." 

It should be remembered, in connection with 
Mansfield's professional struggles and rivalries, 
that he appeared on the stage at a time when 



many actors of rare ability were vying for pub- 
lic favor, both in America and in England. 
The names of Booth, Barrett, Irving, Ellen 
Terry, Modjeska, Jefferson, Florence, Mary 
Anderson, Ada Rehan, James Lewis, John 
Gilbert, Charles Coghlan, Mr. and Mrs. Ken- 
dal, Mrs. Langtry, Wilson Barrett, Charles 
Wyndham, and others that the reader will recall, 
need but to be run over to make impressive enough 
the formidable character of the competition which 
Mansfield had to encounter on the English- 
speaking stage. He always regarded it as the 
mistake of his life that he began his dramatic 
course in this country rather than in Europe. 

Among the carefully studied criticisms (in 
volume two) of Mansfield's various impersona- 
tions, that of Richard the Third, his most nota- 
ble achievement, is especially worth reading. 
" The value of Mansfield's performance of 
Richard" says the author in one place, " did 
not consist in theories or innovations, but in a 
tremendous concentration of intellectual force 
and passionate feeling, expressed with many 
fine touches of dramatic art, resultant in a life- 
like image, terrific and piteous, of grisly wick- 
edness and retributive misery." In a more 
general and comprehensive estimate of Mans- 
field's gifts, the author well says : 

" In faculty of impersonation he was extraordinary, 
and in that respect he has seldom been equalled, in our 
time ; but, because of the inevitable appearance of pecu- 
liarities in all bis embodiments, the merit of versatility 
has often been denied to him: yet he displayed the 
ability, and had the fortune, to distinguish himself in 
almost every branch of the dramatic art, — in comic 
opera, farce, and burlesque, light comedy, romantic 
drama, melodrama, and tragedy. The student, remem- 
bering Mansfield, and musmg upon the many vagaries 
of opinion that are or have been current about bis act- 
ing, might advantageously consider the astonishing 
grasp of diversified character and the wide and easy 
command of expressive art that he exhibited, during 
the twenty-four years of his industrious, laborious, and 
remarkable career." 

A forty-three-page " Chronology,'' valuable 
to the historian of the drama, is appended ; also 
an interesting twelve-page " Note on • Beau 
Brummell ' "; and a " Note on the Gentle Art 
of Plagiarism," for the benefit of Mansfield's 
earlier biographer. An index of twenty-six 
pages concludes the work. The many portraits, 
chiefly of Mansfield in his various characters as 
actor, are of unusual interest as a striking evi- 
dence of his versatility. The whole work is one 
of irresistible appeal to the lover of the stage, 
and with its marks of painstaking workmanship 
(it was begun in 1905) it forms one of the ripest 
and best of its author's many books on kindred 
themes. Percy F. Bicknell.

Ox the Wrong Tracks of Life.* 

Only occasionally is a piece of contemporary 
Italian literature translated into English and 
published in an English-speaking country. 
When so large and serious a work as Sera's 
" On the Tracks of Life " is accorded this 
extension of its sphere of influence, the event 
arouses more than ordinary curiosity as to the 
character and content of the book. This 
curiosity is not abated, to say the least, when 
it finds such a phrase as "The Immorality of 
Morality " used as a sub-title. Examination 
of the book develops the fact that this sub-title 
really strikes the keynote of the whole work, 
though perhaps not in just the manner intended 
by the author. " The Immorality of Morality" 
implies a paradox. The whole book is as para- 
doxical as this phrase. Think for a moment 
of some proposition that the common every-day 
experience of mankind has demonstrated to be 
not true. Then open Sera's book at random, 
read a page or so, and it is rather better than 
an even chance that you will find that identical 
proposition set forth as a great and fundamental 
truth. Thus, to take but a single instance : 
normal right-minded people as a result of then- 
knowledge of history and observation of contem- 
porary society are inclined to regard such things 
as idleness and sexual dissipation, for example, as 
undesirable modes of human activity, — to put 
the case as mildly as may be. But Sera devotes 
pages to the discussion of the "degrading in- 
fluence of work " and to statements like the 
following: "The types of activity which our 
morality more or less explicitly condemns 
(aristocratic tendencies, sexual and economic 
dissipation) — [query : does he mean " high 
finance "?] — have, in my opinion, a very high 
function for the race, and render possible the 
propagation and continuation of human society 
which would otherwise, from many deteriorating 
causes, die out." 

The sentence just quoted states essentially 
the thesis of the whole book. Whatever is 
aristocratic is good, or rather is best — the 
summum bonum of human endeavor. The 
more vicious and anti-social the aristocratic ten- 
dency, the more valuable and beautiful is it con- 
sidered by Sera to be. The first chapter of the 
book deals with " Love." It puts forward as 
the highest ideal not even " free love " as advo- 
cated by some social philosophers, but rather in-

Morality. Translated from the Italian of Leo G. Sera by

discriminate sexual dissipation and debauchery ; 
" the exaltation, the raving, the delirium of the 
agony of the love of a former time : a strong, 
undefined, promiscuous, free, and serene love." 
The utter perversity of the author's conclu- 
sions is nowhere more clearly illustrated than 
in the following summary of his views : " The 
aristocratic ideal, in its triple aspiration towards 
leisure, power, and love, is manifested as a per- 
petual struggle towards natural conditions of 
life ; a healthy, strong and vigorous nature ; pure 
animalness. The existence of this ideal is seen 
to be antagonistic to sociality and morality, 
which both make for the impoverishment, the 
organic degradation of the species man. . . . 
The ultimate aim of every form of social activity 
is animal leisure." 

The reasoning that leads to these conclu- 
sions, which from the standpoint of plain 
common-sense can only be characterized as silly, 
involves a kind of error from which the lucu- 
brations of more profound biologists than Sera 
are not always free. This is the error of at- 
tempting to " explain " that which is objectively 
clear and known, in terms of that which is mys- 
terious, obscure, and unknown or unknowable. 
The plain facts of social evolution are that man- 
kind for a very long time has been, and still is, 
moving steadily away from such aristocratic 
ideals as are enumerated by Sera, toward those 
of democracy and socialism. Only by the 
attempting to " explain " these obvious facts in 
terms of unknown motives and feelings can they 
become so perverted and obscured as they are 
in the work under review. 

The book is fortified, as it were, at both its 
points of entrance and exit, by a militant Intro- 
duction on the one hand, and a positively anni- 
hilating Appendix on the other hand. In both 
of these places any who might be inclined to 
criticize are warned off the premises in no uncer- 
tain terms. In the Introduction (by Dr. Oscar 
Levy) we are told that " there is gradually but 
surely forming itself in all countries a superior 
class of men, who, observing the gulf between 
them and their fellow-men, very soon give up the 
idea of enlightening the unenlightables, and over 
the frontiers of their countries heartily shake 
hands with each other." Signor Sera, we are 
specifically told, is one of those " superior " 
gentlemen : those who do not agree with him 
are of the "unenlightables." The calm and 
temperate spirit in which the author himself 
meets criticism is indicated in the following 
remarks in the Appendix : " However, as criti- 
cisms become poorer and poorer, and at last, as

often happens, even the minor reviewers began 
to think that my silence was due to lack of 
grounds for objecting to their criticisms, and 
raised their perky little heads like young cocks 
with crests not yet full-grown, which nevertheless 
imagine themselves to be kings of their coops, I 
decided that the moment had come when matters 
should be put right." 

Altogether, it is to be expected that this great 
effort of Sera's will, as is predicted by implica- 
tion in the Introduction, fail to enlighten the 
" unenlightables." One ventures to think, how- 
ever, that the primary difficulty is, on the whole, 
with the source of illumination rather than with 
the photo-receptivity of the average reader.

Shakespeare as Neuropath 
axd Lover.* 

At last Shakespeare stands revealed to us ! 
It is nearly three hundred years since he died, 
yet it is only now that we have " his tragic life- 
story." It is almost as if a new play, a greater 
than "Hamlet," had been discovered. And 
the amazing thing is that one had only to read 
Shakespeare to see the man, the lover, the ruined 
life, all as plain as words can make them. This 
is what amazes Mr. Frank Harris, too, who in 
his modesty is forced to assume superiority to 
the hordes of Shakespearian critics who saw 
not the light. Only Goethe and Coleridge got 
glimpses, which, however, led no whither; all the 
rest, and their " tons of talk," are far astray. 

This book of Mr. Harris's would show that 
Shakespeare painted himself not once but 
twenty times. The character that is preemi- 
nently Shakespeare is Hamlet ; and whenever 
Shakespeare, in delineating other characters, 
grew careless, as he very frequently did, he 
dropped into Hamlet, — that is, he depicted 
himself. Some characters are merely Hamlet 
in other circumstances. Romeo is Hamlet in 
love, as Hazlitt had already remarked ; Jaques 
is Hamlet in melancholy discontent. Thus, " if 
we combine the character of Romeo, the poet- 
lover, and Jaques, the pensive-eyed philosopher, 
we have almost the complete Hamlet." As Mr. 
Harris frequently remarks, " Think of it ! " 

These three characters we may therefore re- 
gard as Shakespeare prepense. The real task 
is to find the unconscious Shakespeares. And 
from the wealth of choice let us take — oh, 
anyone will do — say Macbeth. Like Hamlet, 

*The Max Shakespeare axd His Tragic Life-Story. 
By Frank Harris. New York : Mitchell Kennerley. 



Macbeth weighs the pro and con of action to 
fulfil the witches' prophesies ; he is courteous 
in his address — calling Banquo and the others 
" kind gentlemen "; he is " too full of the milk 
of human kindness"; he is irresolute when it 
comes to murdering Duncan ; he has Hamlet's 
"peculiar and exquisite intellectual fairness," 
and remarks that " this Duncan hath borne his 
faculties so meek," etc.; he is the mouthpiece 
of Shakespeare's "marvellous lyrical faculty"; 
he has a religious tinge in his nature — "But 
wherefore," he says, " could not I pronounce 
4 Amen,' " and Hamlet exclaims, " Angels and 
ministers of grace defend us," and later, "I'll 
go pray." " This new trait," remarks Mr. 
Harris, " most intimate and distinctive, is there- 
fore the most conclusive proof of the identity of 
the two characters." Could the most skeptical 
dryasdust professor — Mr. Harris's bete noir — 
demand more ? But in case he should, here it 
is : After the strain of the murder, Macbeth 
loses his nerve. " All this is exquisitely char- 
acteristic of the nervous student who has been 
screwed up to a feat beyond his strength, *a 
terrible feat,' and who has broken down over 
it ; but his words are altogether absurd in the 
mouth of an ambitious half -barbarous chieftain." 
Yet, strange as it may seem, Hamlet managed 
to bear up after he had murdered Polonius and 
sent Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to the final 
surprise of their lives. But after the second 
act, Macbeth seems to be able to do things more 
or less bloody. How account for the change ? 
In the first part, Macbeth is Shakespeare — 
"gentle, bookish, and irresolute"; in the latter 
part, where the dramatist has to follow Holinshed 
and set Macbeth to murdering, he yet " did not 
think of lending Macbeth any tinge of cruelty, 
harshness, or ambition. His Macbeth commits 
murder for the same reason that the timorous 
deer fights — out of fear." This shows how 
kind Shakespeare was ! The same quality is 
further shown in Macbeth's unwillingness to 
fight Macduff in their final meeting, in his 
confession of "pity and remorse, which must 
be compared to the gentle-kindness with which 
Hamlet treats Laertes and Romeo treats Paris." 
Anyone must now be convinced of the identity 
of these characters ! 

In somewhat similar fashion we are taught 
that Duke Vincentio in " Measure for Measure " 
and Posthumus in " Cymbeline " are Hamlet- 
Shakespeare. So Arthur in " King John," and 
Richard II., are after the same model. In 
the case of the latter there is a difference be- 
tween his character in the early part of the play 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



and that in the later. In the former case he 
is selfish, greedy, cruel ; in the second he is all 
that is lovable. Why? Because in the first 
part Shakespeare is following history; in the 
second, he is drawing himself. Would the 
same reasoning apply to Edward II. in Mar- 
lowe's play ? 

From these delineations of character Mr. 
Harris shows that " Shakespeare's nature, even 
in hot, reckless youth, was most feminine and 
affectionate, and that ... he preferred to pic- 
ture irresolution and weakness rather than 
strength." If you don't believe it, look at 
Hotspur. When he is brusque, blame Holin- 
shed ; when he talks about " gentle Severn's 
sedgy bank," he is Shakespeare, — such lan- 
guage is too poetical for Hotspur. Again, it is 
beyond Shakespeare to present courage in Hot- 
spur or in anyone. And yet we seem to have 
heard these lines : 

" Send Danger from the east unto the west, 
So Honour cross it from the north or south, 
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs 
To rouse a lion than to start a hare ! " 

So, too, he cannot present Prince Hal as pos- 
sessing manly virtues. He is not much more 
than a weak imitation of Hotspur. Moreover, 
we learn from Poins that he is lewd, — and, 
as a remarkable coincidence, so are Jaques (or 
so the Duke says), and Vincentio (for does not 
Lucio say so?) ; therefore Shakespeare was lewd, 
he was a sensualist. The character of the Prince 
as here expounded explains the vexed question 
of the rejection of Falstaff . Shakespeare too 
had spent time in bad company, and " like other 
weak men was filled with a desire to throw the 
blame on his ' misleaders.' He certainly ex- 
ulted in their punishment." How Professor 
Bradley's attempt at a solution hides its dimin- 
ished head before the convincing simplicity of 
this brilliant discovery ! But Professor Brad- 
ley is a Dryasdust, and not a revealer. This 
Shakespeare cuts a pretty poor figure ! He has 
no virile virtues or vices, no desperate courage, 
only " a love of honour working on quick gen- 
erous blood " ; no " cruelty, hatred, ambition, 
revenge," the ancillary qualities of courage. 
And yet it seems to us that there is some cruelty 
depicted in " Lear," some hatred and revenge 
in " The Merchant of Venice," and some ambi- 
tion in " Richard III." But no, " manliness was 
not his [Shakespeare's] forte ; he was by nature 
a neuropath and a lover." 

A few more aspects remain. Orsino, in 
" Twelfth Night," the lover of music and flowers 
and passion, is Shakespeare. " Shakespeare lends 



no music to his villains " — Iago and his song, 
" And let me the canakin clink, clink," to the 
contrary notwithstanding. Shakespeare had a 
sense of humor, we are pleased to learn, for we 
would see in this a masculine trait. So we take 
much comfort out of Falstaff. But this staff 
is a broken reed. Not even Shakespeare was 
great enough to create Falstaff ; he must have had 
a model, and that model was probably Chettle ! 
Why ? Because Falstaff surpasses all of Shake- 
speare's other comic characters ; because he de- 
picted Falstaff so poorly in the "Merry Wives " 
that he must have depended on his model whom 
he had already exhausted in " Henry IV."; and 
because Chettle was a jovial soul ! 

But now we come to the actual events of 
Shakespeare's life, which we glean from the 
Sonnets and some of the plays. " W. H.," 
we are to accept without question, is William 
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke ; and the " dark 
lady" is Mary Fitton. There is no doubt 
about it. " The story is very simple : Shake- 
speare loved Mistress Fitton, and sent his 
friend, the young Lord Herbert, to her on some 
pretext, but with the design that he should 
commend Shakespeare to the lady. Mistress 
Fitton fell in love with William Herbert, wooed 
and won him, and Shakespeare had to mourn 
the loss of both friend and mistress." More- 
over, this story has been treated three times in 
the plays — in " Two Gentlemen of Verona," 
" Much Ado," and " Twelfth Night"; yet no one 
has noticed it. " If after these three recitals," 
Mr. Harris says, " anyone can still believe the 
sonnet-story is imaginary, he is beyond per- 
suasion by argument." 

Now this Mary Fitton has already appeared 
in the plays, for we can recognize her by 
Shakespeare's very careful descriptions. She 
is Rosaline in " Romeo and Juliet," as well as 
the girl of the same name in " Love's Labour's 
Lost." In all cases we have dark hair, dark 
eyes, pale complexion. All would fit in so nicely 
with Mary Fitton, were it not that Mistress 
Mary, we know from authentic portraits, was a 
blonde beauty ! But let that go. This Mary 
Fitton he loved with an intense passion ; but 
towards the traitor Herbert he expresses no 
anger, since Shakespeare dearly loved a lord. 
He was an arrant snob, like all your English. 
And thus Shakespeare, for twelve mortal years 
from 1597 to 1608, suffered such agonies as 
only a genius and a disappointed sensualist can 
endure. The fruit of this agony we have in the 
plays, — so let us be thankful that poor gentle 
Shakespeare had a sad and weary lot. It is 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



119 



accordingly not Brutus, but Shakespeare, who, 
" racked by love and jealousy, tortured by be- 
trayal, was at war with himself." Like Hamlet, 
he was prompted to his revenge by heaven and 
hell, but he was too gentle and kind to act it 
out. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern did not 
report their opinion of Hamlet's farewell kind- 
ness. All Hamlet's unreasoning rage at his 
mother's lechery is Shakespeare telling Mary 
Fitton what he thinks of her. " If anyone can 
imagine that this is the way a son thinks of a 
mother's slip," sadly comments our author, "he 
is past my persuading." Past, long past ! How 
simple the complex problem of " Hamlet " be- 
comes in the light of these revelations ! Othello's 
jealous fury against Desdemona merges into 
Shakespeare's wrath towards Mary Fitton. 
Desdemona never showed " high and plenteous 
wit and invention," but Mary did, alas, too 
much ! A still closer portrait of Mistress Fit- 
ton we get in Cressida ; and, what is equally 
interesting, we learn that Shakespeare wrote 
this " wretched invertebrate play," this libel on 
Greece, to mock Chapman, the rival poet of the 
Sonnets. Ignorant of Greek, he poured con- 
tempt on it and on Chapman. " This estab- 
lishes the opinion that Chapman was indeed the 
rival poet." Reasoning can no farther go ! As 
we might guess (provided we are not professors, 
like Dowden and Gollancz), Cleopatra is Mary 
Fitton, and Antony is Shakespeare. The inter- 
view between Thyreus and Cleopatra was writ- 
ten " out of wounded personal feeling," to show 
up the fickle Mary. She doesn't mind it, now 
that the discovery has just been made, — but 
she wrecked Shakespeare's life. " Hamlet in 
love with Cleopatra, the poet lost in desire of 
the wanton, — that is the tragedy of Shake- 
speare's life."' His passion led him to " shame 
and madness and despair ; his strength broke 
down under the strain, and he never won back 
again to health." Lear expresses his own dis- 
illusion and naked misery ; it is the first attempt 
in all literature to paint madness, Mr. Harris 
informs us. We receive the news with fitting 
modesty. " Timon " is merely " a scream of 
pain " closing the agony. 

After all this, Shakespeare went to Stratford 
to recuperate under the care of his daughter : 
Mr. Harris tells us so. Then came the Romances, 
" all copies "; Shakespeare was " too tired to 
invent or even to annex." Prospero is Shake- 
speare ; and so is Ariel, who was imprisoned 
painfully for a dozen years to a foul witch, — to 
whom, indeed, but Mary Fitton ? 

The close of this veracious history is occupied 



with Shakespeare's " Life," which incorporates, 
as credible, stories ranging from Audrey's ac- 
count of Shakespeare's killing a calf in high 
style and making a speech, to his parentage of 
D'Avenant. A fitting close to the romance. 

It is interesting to note that the book, which 
contains such violent diatribes on the English 
aristocracy as would have made good Radical 
campaign literature in the recent elections, is 
dedicated to an English peer. A fitting begin- 
ning to the romance. James W. Tupper. 



The Age of Waterways.* 



" It will require the best thought and best 
effort of this generation," wrote Mr. Hill to the 
late Governor Johnson of Minnesota, " to avert 
the evil that now casts its shadow upon the 
farmer, manufacturer, and merchant, to arrest 
the progress of the paralysis that is laying its 
grip upon the heart of commerce, and to restore 
the wholesome circulation without which there 
cannot be life and growth in either individual 
or the commonwealth." Mr. Herbert Quick, 
author of a recent work on " American Inland 
Waterways," sees but one way out of this diffi- 
culty, and that is in the development of our 
great continental waterways so as to enable 
them to perform their proper economic share of 
the work of transportation. "It is a great 
task," he says, "but it is quite within our 
power ; and the waterways can do the work 
completely, which the railways never can. The 
natural expense of land carriage is high, and 
the capacity of railways is strictly limited. The 
capacity of a waterway like the new Erie Canal 
is equal to a dozen railways. The capacity of 
a deep waterway down the Mississippi is almost 
incalculable ; but it is entirely safe to say that 
no conceivable tonnage derived from the Mis- 
sissippi Valley and Lake Basin could tax its 
carrying power. ... In efficiency, the water- 
ways leave nothing to be desired as a remedy 
for our transportation ills." 

Mr. Quick proceeds to discuss the advantages 
of waterways on the score of economy, and 
makes out an exceedingly strong case for them. 
His book is, in fact, an admirably clear and 
full presentation of a subject that is already 
looming large on the national horizon, and bids 
fair to be of paramount importance to the peo-

pie of America. He has brought together, in 
clear and readable shape, a mass of material 
bearing not only on the question of inland water- 
ways, but also on the closely related subjects of 
the conservation of forests and streams, and the 
generation of water-powers, with their relation 
to the great problems of power, heat, light, coal 
resources, and the conservation of mechanical 
efficiency arising therefrom. Mr. Quick has 
succeeded well in his attempt to convey, in 
terms capable of comprehension by the average 
citizen, the scientific knowledge of the subject 
as embodied in such recent documents as the 
Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways 
Commission and the Report of the Chicago 
Harbor Commission. He goes somewhat fully 
into a discussion of the efforts that have already 
been made by the government to improve the 
rivers and harbors of the United States, — 
efforts which aggregate a cost of $500,000,000, 
and yet mark but the beginning of what may 
be accomplished in the direction of the devel- 
opment of the inland waterways of the country. 
The trouble has been, as in so many other 
public undertakings here and elsewhere, that 
the work of improvement has been haphazard 
and lacking in system. One of the principal 
objects of the Newlands bill in Congress was to 
bring together all these scattered efforts and 
mould and enlarge them into a comprehensive 
scheme of waterways which would ultimately 
embrace every important river and lake in the 
United States, the rivers to be connected by 
canals, following in most cases the old portage 
paths of Indian and fur-trader, and by coastal 
canals connecting tidal lakes, bays, sounds, and 
river mouths, like the one proposed for naviga- 
tion from Boston to Florida and from Florida 
to the Texan ports. This remarkable bill, on 
which Mr. Quick bases many of his arguments, 
is not the project of a dreamer, but rather the 
measure of a practical statesman, and repre- 
sents to a large extent the ideas of such men as 
Mr. Pinchot, late head of the Forest Service, of 
Marshall O. Leighton of the Water Resources 
Branch of the Geological Survey, of Director 
Newell of the Reclamation Service, of Dr. Mc- 
Gee the erosion expert, of Secretary Wilson, 
and of Ex-President Roosevelt. It is designed 
not merely to promote transportation on inland 
waterways, by vessels of a standard draught, 
but also " to consider and coordinate the ques 
tions of irrigation, swamp-land reformation, 
clarification of streams, utilization of water- 
power, prevention of soil waste, protection of 
forests, regulation of flow, control of floods," 



and the innumerable other questions arising 
from or connected with the great subject of the 
conservation of our natural resources. 

The waterway to which Mr. Quick devotes 
most attention is the Lakes-to-the-Gulf project, 
as to the vital importance of which he brings 
together a convincing array of facts and figures ; 
nor does he neglect the important projects 
undertaken or contemplated by Canada to im- 
prove her inland waterways. It is not to be 
wondered at that in discussing the larger aspects 
of the question Mr. Quick rises to a degree of 
enthusiasm. With the facts in his mind and a 
map of North America spread before him, any 
man may quickly convince himself of the tre- 
mendous potentialities of our inland waterways, 
and incidentally of the unique strategic posi- 
tions held by Chicago — and by that Canadian 
Chicago, the city of Winnipeg. With the 
Mississippi route completed on the one hand, 
and the Georgian Bay Canal on the other, Chi- 
cago would stand at the angle of two immense 
water-systems, — one leading south to the Gulf 
of Mexico, and ultimately through the Panama 
Canal to the Pacific and Asia ; the other leading 
east to the Atlantic and to Europe. Similarly, 
Winnipeg bids fair to become the central point 
in a waterway system of almost equally stupen- 
dous proportions. When the works now under 
way, or promised, are completed, Winnipeg 
will have water communication with Edmonton, 
at the foot of the Rocky Mountains ; a series of 
short canals, presenting no serious engineering 
difficulties, would connect with Lake Superior, 
and ultimately with Montreal and the Atlantic. 
Scientific experts and hard-headed business men 
are already discussing the project of connecting- 
Lake Winnipeg and Hudson Bay, by a series 
of short canals on the Nelson River ; and it is 
quite within the realms of the possible that 
Winnipeg may some day be connected with the 
Mississippi by way of the Red River, Lake 
Traverse, and the Minnesota. Given the devel- 
opment of these great waterways, — and with 
the present trend of public opinion throughout 
the continent, such a development is quite 
probable, — and the next half -century may wit- 
ness the curious spectacle of Chicago controlling 
the trade of America with Asia and Australasia ; 
and Winnipeg controlling the trade of the conti- 
nent, or at any rate its western half, with Europe.

The Bordeblam) of Psychical 
Research.* 



The belief that human individuality survives 
the crisis known as death has been held from 
time immemorial, and is embodied in nearly 
all religious creeds. Inasmuch as all phenom- 
ena, in a literal sense, are psychological, and 
what we call the physical world is a picture 
painted with the pigments of the mind, it seems 
incredible that anything can be less real or less 
permanent than human consciousness. On the 
other hand, the temporary interruption of this 
consciousness is a commonplace experience ; 
while phenomena present themselves to us in 
such a way as to lead to the inference that those 
perceived are connected by many others, some 
ascertainable by inference, others wholly beyond 
our power to imagine. Modern science is like 
a cloth in which are utilized many scraps con- 
taining fragments of a pattern, on the basis of 
which the original design is attempted to be re- 
produced. It is universally admitted that the 
scraps — our experiences — do not represent the 
whole cloth ; the most stupid can see that they 
are parts of a larger scheme, but the wisest 
cannot make sure of all the original details. 
Orthodox religion supposes that there exists a 
mind in which the pattern originated, and which, 
therefore, is well aware of the whole arrange- 
ment ; a philosophy which has the merit of 
finding a psychological counterpart for every 
phase of reality. 

It is one thing, however, to postulate con- 
sciousness as eternal and universal, and quite 
another to demonstrate an ultramundane career 
for such particular foci of it as we find in indi- 
vidual human beings. The reviewer, for his 
own part, has always believed in the continuity 
of personal identity, because it seems to him that 
any coherent philosophical scheme demands it, 
and that in the midst of very much that is 
certainly mutable there exists a nucleus of 
something permanent. This, however, is a 
metaphysical conception ; whereas Sir Oliver 
Lodge and the Society for Psychical Research 
seek to bring the subject within the range of 
scientific enquiry. 

It might be supposed that patient endeavors 
to throw light on matters so abstruse, and yet 
of such manifest importance to mankind, would 
be applauded on every hand. Constituted as 
man is, the fear and sorrow due to death seem

at times almost too great a price to pay for our 
highly developed psychical powers, and at the 
least seriously reduce the pleasure of living. 
If they have been necessary for the preservation 
of the race, it seems evident that they have now 
exceeded somewhat the bounds of utility, and 
their mitigation might be welcomed for social as 
well as for individual reasons. This has been 
continually attempted in the past, by religious 
creeds ; and even to-day is accomplished to a 
large extent on more or less intangible grounds. 
Many still deem this sufficient, but it ought to 
be self-evident that definite scientific proof of 
survival would be a substantial gain. 

Unfortunately, the work of the Society for 
Psychical Research has met with no such favor 
as it seems to us to deserve. According to Sir 
Oliver Lodge, it is continually subjected to ad- 
verse criticism from the Spiritualists, who, long 
ago convinced of the survival of human person- 
ality after death, consider the methods employed 
ridiculously slow and cautious. On the other 
hand, the outside world and orthodox science 
generally regard it with contempt, as over- 
credulous and uncritical. The author concludes : 

" Well, we have had to stand this buffeting, as well 
as the more ponderous blows inflicted by the other side ; 
and it was hardly necessary to turn the cheek to the 
smiter, since in an attitude of face-forward progress the 
buffets were sure to come with fair impartiality; greater 
frequency on the one side making up for greater strength 
on the other." 

Sir Oliver's book begins by a discussion of 
experiments which are held to demonstrate telep- 
athy. This phenomenon is accepted as genuine 
by many who do not believe at all in disembodied 
spirits. It is, in fact, one of the obstacles to the 
demonstration of the existence of the latter ; 
since if any of the facts communicated are known 
to any living being they may conceivably have 
been received telepathically, while if they are 
not known they may be incapable of proof. An 
endeavor to overcome this difficulty is described 
on page 122. The late F. W. H. Myers, in 1891, 
prepared a sealed letter, the contents of which 
were known to no one but himself. About ten 
years later Myers died, and in 1904 it seemed 
to several members of the Society that messages 
had been received which must contain the sub- 
stance of the hidden letter. Sir Oliver Lodge 
issued a circular inviting attendance at the 
Society's rooms, and the envelope was opened. 
It was found that there was no resemblance 
between its actual contents and the messages 
received. Those hostile to the whole movement 
will of course receive this result with jeers ; but

the author justly points out that failure was not 
unlikely after so long an interval, and that even 
success would not have been absolute proof. In 
the event of success it would have been conceiv- 
able that the letter was read by the medium 
through some process of clairvoyance ; or, I sup- 
pose, that its contents had been received tele- 
pathically by someone from Myers during the 
latters lifetime, and were waiting in some sub- 
conscious region of the mind to be revealed in 
response to the proper stimulus. Absurd as 
these suppositions may seem, many would no 
doubt resort to them in preference to admitting 
the communication to be from someone now dead. 
An example given in the book, which is 
thought to represent a successful experiment, is 
quoted from Kant as follows : 

" Madame Herteville (Marteville), the widow of the 
Dutch ambassador in Stockholm, some time after the 
death of her husband, was called upon by Croon, a gold- 
smith, to pay for a silver service which her husband had 
purchased from him. The widow was convinced that 
her late husband had been much too precise and orderly 
not to have paid this debt, yet she was unable to find this 
receipt. In her sorrow, and because the amount was 
considerable, she requested Mr. Swedenborg to call at 
her house. After apologising to him for troubling him, 
she said that if, as all people say, he possessed the extra- 
ordinary gift of conversing with the souls of the departed, 
he would perhaps have the kindness to ask her husband 
how it was about the silver service. Swedenborg did 
not at all object to comply with her request. Three days 
afterwards the said lady had company at her house for 
coffee. Swedenborg called, and in his cool way informed 
her that he had conversed with her husband. The debt 
had been paid several months before his decease, and the 
receipt was in a bureau in the room upstairs. The lady 
replied that the bureau had been quite cleared out and 
that the receipt was not found among all the papers. 
Swedenborg said that her husband had described to him 
how after pulling out the lef thand drawer a board would 
appear, which required to be drawn out, when a secret 
compartment would be disclosed, containing his private 
Dutch correspondence, as well as the receipt. Upon hear- 
ing this description the whole company arose and accom- 
panied the lady into the room upstairs. The bureau was 
opened; they did as they were directed; the compart- 
ment was found, of which no one had ever known before; 
and to the great astonishment of all, the papers were 
discovered there, in accordance with his description." 

A rather obvious objection to this piece of 
evidence is that Swedenborg might have known 
of the existence of such a bureau in the house, 
and been aware that those of this make contained 
such a receptacle. It is not necessary to assume 
that he was acting a frivolous or insincere part ; 
impressed with the opinion that the receipt 
existed somewhere, his natural guess might have 
come into his mind with the force of a message, 
as is often the case in more commonplace circum- 
stances. Of course two different theories are 



possible, according to one's convictions. It is 
possible to suppose that in the numerous cases 
in which strong conviction arises without any 
apparently sufficient evidence, there are super- 
normal agencies at work. 

A long account was given, on the authority of 
Mr. H. W. Wack, of St. Paul, Minnesota, of a 
dream in which the killing of a tramp was made 
known, though this occurred some distance away 
and the unknown man was of no particular in- 
terest to the dreamer. It is suggested that this 
shows how the influence of such an event may be 
conveyed not merely to those who would naturally 
be concerned, but to complete outsiders. The 
special thing noted by the dreamer was that, the 
tramp having been killed by the train in which 
he imagined himself to be travelling, the body 
could not be found. The next day he read in 
the paper of such an occurrence, the account 
stating that the body had been cut to small 
pieces, and no identification was possible. 
Several objections to the value of this evidence 
occur readily to the reader who is familiar with 
American railroads. The dreamer had been 
accustomed to travel on this particular road, 
and must often have read of and pondered over 
the killing of tramps, which is a much more 
frequent occurrence than Sir Oliver Lodge 
probably imagines. If at all sensitive he must 
have dreaded the possibility of being present 
when one of these accidents occurred. Moreover, 
the dream explicitly shows the train as stopping 
immediately after the man had given his death- 
shriek, whereas the newspaper stated that it did 
not stop at all, but proceeded in ignorance of 
the accident, which explained the condition of 
the remains. The inability to find the body in 
the dream is in accordance with a common ex- 
perience in dreams, when the expected fails to 
happen. 

In the above account I have laid emphasis on 
the evidence which seems to me to be faulty ; 
that which has a better claim is much more com- 
plicated, and will not admit of abstraction. 
Sir Oliver Lodge states that he is thoroughly 
convinced by it, but recognizes that much more 
work needs to be done to put the matter on a 
proper basis. 

" It rather feels as if we were at the beginning of 
what is practically a fresh branch of science ; and that 
to pretend to frame explanations, except in the most 
tentative and elastic fashion for the purpose of thread- 
ing the facts together and suggesting fresh fields for 
experiments, is as premature as it would have been for 
Galvani to have expounded the nature of electricity, or 
Copernicus the laws of Comets and Meteors " (p. 239).

the Society for Psychical Research consists 
neither of fools nor knaves. The attitude of

deficiency to all workers in these unpopular 
fields, no matter how eminent in other respects 
they may be, is nowise different from that which 
led to the persecution of the pioneers in the now

The weakness " A Power &* round ^M* weak " 
and the power ness " — these are the words Shelley 
of Shelley. ^^ f himself in the " Adonais " ; 

and it would be hard for any biographer to improve 
upon the brevity and truth of his own characteriza- 
tion. Most biographers, in fact, have either tried 
to hide the weakness — as if to acknowledge it were 
to belittle the Power, — or else have thrown the 
limelight upon the weakness until the Power almost 
lost itself in the shadows. It is twenty-four years 
since Dowden collected his great body of materials 
and wrote what will probably always remain the 
standard biography of Shelley ; the form of the man 
there presented has not been changed materially by 
any documents or facts that have since been brought 
to light. That Shelley as a poet belongs among the 
world's great ones, few would now have the hardi- 
hood to deny ; but considered as a man, the question 
is still open. Were certain of his contemporaries 
right who regarded him as a fiend incarnate, or are 
his modern admirers right who pronounce him unfit 
for this world only because he was fit for a better? 
Among the numerous attempts at appraisal of 
Shelley in his human aspect, perhaps none is saner 
and fairer, and certainly none more spirited and 
entertaining, than the book of nearly three hundred 
pages offered by Mr. A. Clutton-Brock, " Shelley 
the Man and the Poet " (Putnam). The author's 
attitude toward his subject seems to be not unlike 
that often felt toward those we love best, — their 
worst faults amuse rather than irritate us. Thus, 
speaking of Shelley's early opinions of religion, he 
says : u Having got his own idea of what the world 
ought to be almost as easily as a baby gets its appe- 
tite, he found that the Christian religion did not fall 
in with that idea and determined to destroy it with 
a light heart." Again, quoting from one of the in- 
numerable manifestos of Shelley's youth, the author 
adds : " As we read these pompous and complacent 
sentences we must remember he was only nineteen ; 
and it is well at that age to have the ambition to 
reform the world." Much of Shelley's most ques- 
tionable writing and conduct came from the fact 
that he had no historical sense, and " never under- 
stood that all the institutions which he hated had 
been made by men of the same nature as those 
whom he wished to deliver from such institutions "; 



all his arguments were based on the assumption 
that " men would be all good if laws did not make 
them bad," and that " the conflict of life is entirely a 
struggle between the good that is within men and 
the evil that is outside them." Some men, therefore, 
were all bad, being willing slaves of the tyrant evil ; 
others were all good, being heroic rebels or helpless 
victims. In his treatment of the H Harriet question," 
our author is uncommonly fair, saying truly, u Be- 
cause he was a great poet and she a poor woman 
who came to a miserable end, there is no reason 
why her memory should be sacrificed to his." 
Shelley had many infirmities of heart and mind, 
and was never cured of them ; to the end they 
appeared in his poetry, and troubled Mary as they 
had brought disaster to Harriet- But his character 
was essentially noble, his genius great. He always 
desired to love men and to be loved by them ; but 
from lack of communion with them, he became the 
intimate friend of nature. Often, in his poetry, he 
seems to sing to an audience of mountains and 
winds and clouds, as if they would understand him 
better than the human beings who received his 
music with anger or laughter. The reader who 
would understand or enjoy Shelley's best poetry 
must not ask what is the use of it all ; he must have 
faith in it as a prophecy of a nobler state of being, 
and as the expression of emotions and ideas to which 
men in that nobler state may some day attain. As 
a whole, Mr. Clutton-Brock has given us a delight- 
ful book ; for even when we least agree with him we 
cannot help delighting in the easy but sure touch 
with which he re-tells the always fascinating story 
of Shelley's life, and interprets his singular charac- 
ter and his splendid genius. 

A "footnote person" is the phrase

Higginson, and applied by him to 
Bronson Alcott in one of the brief essays contained 
in a volume of collected studies entitled " Carlyle's 
Laugh, and Other Surprises" (Houghton). We trust 
that it will seem no reflection upon their interest or 
value to characterize these studies by this same use- 
ful phrase. Slight and sketchy as they are, these 
papers are pleasantly indicative of personal and often 
intimate association with many a distinguished man 
and woman of letters. Their value lies in this, not 
in completeness of portraiture or depth of interpre- 
tative comment. The collection includes a score of 
articles previously published in periodical or book, 
on Cooper, Brockden Brown, Thoreau, Alcott, 
Bancroft, Norton, Stedman, Edward Everett Hale, 
Horace E. Scudder, Emily Dickinson, Julia Ward 
Howe, and several others. They are all pleasantly 
written — they are all in a sense " footnotes " to 
more adequate studies of their subjects. One may 
read with especial interest the paper on Emily 
Dickinson, whose story recalls our debt to Mr. 
Higginson for his introduction to the world of 
this strangely gifted woman. One is glad also to 
possess even this brief sketch of that modest and

tireless literary worker, Horace Scudder ; it is a 
tribute well deserved, and might have been ex- 
panded with advantage. The best of the essays, 
however, is that which opens the volume. Has 
"Carlyle's laugh," by the way, been described in 
literature, since Teuf elsdrOckh's hearty cachinnation 
was echoed in the "Sartor Resartus"? "It was a 
broad, honest, human laugh," says Mr. Higginson, 
" which, beginning in the brain, took into its action 
the whole heart and diaphragm, and instantly 
changed the worn face into something frank and 
even winning, giving to it an expression that would 
have won the confidence of any child." Speaking 
truthfully, this echo of the Sartorian laughter is the 
pleasant " surprise " in the volume ; indeed, we do 
not recollect that we discovered any other contribu- 
tion that quite justified the promise in the latter part 

of the title. 

Books upon the opera multiply in 
proportion to the awakening activ- 
ities of the operatic world. Miss 
Esther Singleton's "Guide to Modern Opera" 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a companion volume to her 
earlier book of similar design, and describes works 
of the most modern school. A few of the old works, 
such as "Otello," " Mefistofile," and "Parsifal," 
are included only because they did not find a place 
in the earlier volume. But such moderns as Debussy, 
Strauss, Charpentier, Humperdinck, and Blockx, get 
most of the pages. Twenty-six operas are described 
altogether, and there are a dozen illustrations of fa- 
mous singers, in character. Miss Singleton tells the 
stories, but attempts little or nothing of musical 
analysis and criticism. — Miss Gladys Davidson gives 
us a similar book, with an added dash of biography, 
in the third series of her "Stories from the Operas" 
(Lippincott), published in the "Music Lover's Li- 
brary." She describes works to the number of an 
even dozen, and the illustrations are portraits of 
composers. — Mr. H. E. Krehbiel's "Book of Operas" 
(Macmillan) is a far more serious performance than 
these others. It goes extensively into musical history, 
besides providing competent analysis with illustra- 
tions in musical notation. There are also many other 
illustrations of varied and often of curious interest, 
such as a portrait of da Ponte, the Americanized 
Italian who wrote Mozart's most famous librettos, of 
a number of scenes historically interesting, of com- 
posers, singers, and stage-pictures. Mr. Krehbiel 
deals with a total of seventeen works, chosen because 
their importance may claim such thorough treatment 
as he aims to give. They include the three great 
operas of Mozart, the five of Wagner (excluding 
the "Ring"), Verdi's "Traviata" and "Aida," and 
such single examples as " Fidelio," " II Barbiere " 
and "Der Freischtttz," and "Hansel und Gretel." 
The other three to complete the tale are the group 
dealing with the Faust story, the works of Gounod, 
Boito, and Berlioz. This is a very interesting and val- 
uable book, which we commend to the attention of all 
opera-goers. — While on the subject of music, we 
may as well make note of Elise Polko's " Musical 



Sketches" (Sturgis & Walton), an old-time favorite 
with the sentimental, now translated from the fif- 
teenth German edition. It is still not a bad book 
for the young. — "Stokes* Encyclopedia of Music 
and Musicians " has been a useful reference-book 
for some time, and is now reissued in a revised and 
enlarged edition, prepared by Mr. L. J. de Bekkers. 
It is a volume of seven hundred and fifty two- 
columned pages. 

One of the hopeful signs in the war-

of prevention. . ° ' ° 

so vigorously waged in recent years, 

is the growing number of books dealing with medi- 
cal subjects written by competent authorities and 
designed primarily for the general public. Dr. Woods 
Hutchinson's " Preventable Diseases" (Houghton) 
is not only authoritative and comprehensive, but it 
is sane and sensible, and likewise most entertaining 
reading. It treats of hygienic and sanitary matters 
of prime importance and profound interest to every 
individual, family, and community ; and the advice 
so freely given, if sensibly followed, will do much 
to check the outbreak and spread of preventable 
diseases and to reduce the suffering and misery that 
follow in their wake. The book is written in a free 
and breezy style. The author's opinions are ex- 
pressed with clearness and vigor, and popular fads 
and fallacies are exposed in plain language. He is 
a wholesome and rational optimist, and every page 
of his book breathes hope and inspires courage to 
the individual or community in the fight against 
disease. The treatment of heredity and disease is 
eminently sensible, and will be a godsend to many 
distressed souls. The discussion of " Tuberculosis, 
a scotched snake," is also well fitted to bring hope 
where fear reigns. Censervatives will doubtless find 
fault at times with the author's picturesque state- 
ments and free discussion of professional data, but 
all must admire his breadth of view and humane 
purpose. Among the topics treated are the natural 
powers of recuperation of the body, so often under- 
estimated ; the signs of disease, typhoid fever, ade- 
noids, colds, cancer, nerves, appendicitis, malaria, 
rheumatism, diphtheria, and mental influence in 
disease. The book is a desirable addition to the 
library of both home and school. 

Mr. G. E. Scott Elliott, author of a 
up-date. handsome volume entitled " Botany 

of To-Day" (Lippincott), reveals 
himself as an Englishman and a traveller. His inter- 
est in botany is probably incidental to his journeying 
about the world ; but he would fain have others share 
his enthusiasm, and so he writes a book, — having in 
view the worthy end, as he expresses it, " to tempt 
some readers to examine plants for themselves." If 
readers are not thus tempted it will not be because 
Mr. Elliott has not brought before them avast amount 
of material, botanical and other. His industry and 
zeal are beyond question: the whole field of attain- 
ment and research shall be his, from the cedar of 
Lebanon to the hysop that springeth from the wall.

Unfortunately, his zeal is not always according to 
knowledge. Not being a botanist himself, his dis- 
crimination is often at fault ; and notwithstanding 
hosts of high authorities cited, he sometimes falls 
into error, — as when he tells us that leaves of the 
Victoria pond-lily are sixty feet across, or when he 
groups our pretty flowering Vallisneria among the 
algce. Mr. Elliott seems also deficient in what is 
called literary style. The chapters have no special 
sequence or arrangement, and are broken into a mul- 
titude of paragraphs where sentence is disjoined from 
sentence for no obvious reason, but with an effect 
upon the reader which is, to say the least, dishearten- 
ing ; he experiences a succession of mental jolts, as 
if compelled to traverse a corduroy road, instead of 
following the smooth chaussee prepared for him by 
a more skilful writer. The sentences themselves are 
scarcely models of correct construction ; the verbs 
have a fashion of being attracted into the number of 
the noun nearest, rather than yielding to the milder 
solicitations of the remoter sentence -subject. A 
single instance may suffice to illustrate many things : 
" Near lake Nyanza I rose a grasshopper-like creature 
which alighted on a withered grass haulm and was at 
once invisible. Its mode of resting aped exactly the 
hang of withered spikelets, and the color of such part 
of its wings and legs as were exposed were precisely 
that of the withered vegetation." Two chapters — 
one on Conifers and one on Arable Land — are per- 
haps the most useful in the book, being compends of 
the agriculture of the British Isles. The bibliography 
which closes the volume will be serviceable to stu- 
dents ; and there are many beautiful half-tone illus- 
trations, some of which refer to matters discussed in 
the text. —

ago that Sir Francis Galton began his active cam- 
paign for the promotion of eugenic research and the 
dissemination of eugenic ideas. Now strong and 
flourishing organizations making these matters their 
specific business exist in England, Germany, and the 
United States. While the stream of periodical litera- 
ture on the subject is steadily increasing in volume, 
books dealing directly with it have as yet been few. 
Dr. C. W. Saleeby's "Parenthood and Race Culture " 
(Moffat, Yard, & Co.) is the first attempt to give a 
comprehensive view of the general problems of 
engenics, and the direction which examination of 
them seems likely to take. Dr. Saleeby is a man of 
strong, if not always profoundly reasoned, opinions, 
and his presentation of the case is forceful and inter- 
esting. He lays great stress on the importance of 
reducing the infant mortality rate. In general he 
appears to regard a low birth-rate as in no way 
inherently an alarming or even a serious matter, 
provided the rate of infant mortality is concurrently 
reduced. Many could be found who would not agree 
with these ideas, but that is not necessarily against 
them. In so relatively new and important a field of 
thought a full and frank presentation of all points of 



view and shades of opinion is much to be desired. 
The care with which the proof-reading of this volume 
was done is indicated by the following curious ver- 
sion of a well-known quotation which stands at the 
head of a chapter : " L'homme n'est gu'un yoseau, 
le plus faible de la Nature ; mais c'est an yoseau 

pensant." 

"Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong 

ttaXTal. forever on the thr °ne," may not be 
exactly the refrain of " Men the 
Workers" (Doubleday, Page, & Co.), a collection of 
speeches and papers from the tongue and pen of the 
late Henry Demarest Lloyd ; but the poet's words 
are repeatedly brought to mind as one reads Mr. 
Lloyd's vigorous protests, iterated and reiterated, 
against the greed and injustice of plutocracy, and 
his eloquent plea for justice to the working man and 
a recognition of his rights as a human being. The 
speeches now gathered into a book were delivered at 
various times between 1889 and 1903, the latter year 
being that of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission, 
before which Mr. Lloyd spoke so effectively. His 
homely and telling way of putting things is often 
illustrated in the pages of this volume, — as when, 
referring to " government by injunction," he speaks 
of " punishment at the mercy of a judge's sour tem 
per or sour stomach "; and again, " There is another 
end to this poker." Idioms of this sort must have 
proved effective with audiences of working people. 
Probably, too, he touched a responsive chord when 
he styled Mr. John Mitchell " first in strikes, first in 
arbitration, and first in the hearts of the working- 
men." In a speech delivered on the fourth of July, 
1889, are the words: "Eighteen hundred and eighty- 
nine declares that . . . property, like government, 
has no just powers but those which it derives from 
the consent of the people." Have the twenty-one 
intervening years brought any convincing proofs that 
this truth is gaining general recognition ? The vol- 
ume contains many striking passages testifying to 
Mr. Lloyd's quick reading of the signs of the times, 
and his unselfish ardor for human rights and justice.

been a great diversifying factor in their social evolu- 
tion. In the ant community the devotion to the com- 
mon weal is instant and absolute, even to the loss of 
life or limb ; but the queen has no sceptre, there is 
no ruling class, and every ant is a law unto itself. If

equally successful, it must attain that perfect individ- 
ual discipline, self-control, and self-devotion to the 
good of the whole community, that one sees in a 
commonwealth of ants. The book is interesting as 
natural history, and will be suggestive to all con- 
cerned with the foundations of social organization. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Most expert observers have not ceased to regard the 
George Junior Republic as a social experiment, with too 
short a history and too narrow a range for final conclu- 
sions. None the less the story of its development by 
a man who discovered his pedagogical principles as oc- 
casion arose, generally after failures, is full of interest. 
The fundamental idea of Mr. George's " The Junior 
Republic " (Appleton) is that training for responsible 
citizenship must begin in an actual community where 
the laws and institutions express the convictions of the 
people. Scepticism is apt to arise in relation to a 
scheme which seems to ignore the transitional character 
of immature persons, and to require them, perhaps only 
in appearance, to assume the tasks of adults. The 
anecdotes and pictures from real life are genuine rev- 
elations of the souls of young people. 

To interpret the facts and activities of the present 
day from a socially constructive standpoint, having in 
view chiefly the common welfare, is the aim of Dr. 
Devine's little volume on " Social Forces " (Charities 
Publication Committee) a collection of editorials which 
have appeared from time to time since 1907 in " The 
Survey." The essays are simply written, and deal with 
a wide range of American problems. The " new view " 
advocated by Dr. Devine implies neither an unthinking 
enthusiasm for the poor and oppressed on the one hand, 
nor a remote cold scrutiny of human problems on the 
other, but an inspiring and earnest eagerness to set things 
in their right relations, to work slowly but steadily for 
a " social order in which ancient wrongs shall be righted, 
new corruptions foreseen and prevented, the nearest 
approach to equality of opportunity assured, and the 
individual rediscovered under conditions vastly more 
favorable for his greatest usefulness to his fellows and 
for the highest development of all his powers." 

The bibliographer can do no more useful work than 
that of directing the reading of children into the right 
channels. An important adjunct to such work will be 
found in the " Children's Catalog " which has been com- 
piled by Miss Marion E. Potter and others, and is pub- 
lished by the H. W. Wilson Co. The first part of this work 
is an author, title, and subject catalogue of three thou- 
sand books, based upon a selection of the lists approved 
by twenty-four libraries. The second and larger part 
provides an index to the later volumes of " St. Nicholas " 
and analytical subject references to five hundred of the 
books for children previously catalogued. The work 
should prove of great usefulness. We have at the same 
time two books from the Baker & Taylor Co., being 
« A Child's Guide to Reading," by Mr. John Macy, and 
«A Child's Guide to Biography," by Mr. Burton E. 



Stevenson. The first of these volumes consists of 
chapters upon the various species of reading, with anno- 
tated lists of books. The second is just a book of brief 
biographies of American men of action, from Columbus 
to Cleveland. 

" The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club " are 
published in a two- volume " Topical " edition by the 
Messrs. Scribner. The volumes are very bulky, but 
they have an adequate excuse for being in the great 
wealth and variety of the illustrative material which 
they bring together. To begin with, they reproduce all 
the illustrations of the original edition, including the 
green cover of that famous first number. Then they 
contain more than two hundred other pictures and fac- 
similes calculated to bring joy to the heart of every 
true Pickwickian. Mr. C. van Noorden has been the 
collector of all this material. The volumes are too big 
to read comfortably, but there are other ways of enjoy- 
ing books besides reading them. 



Notes. 



" Yet Again " is the characteristic title of a new col- 
lection of Max Beerbohm's genial and whimsical essays, 
to be published immediately by John Lane Co. 

General Morris Schaff's remarkably vivid and inter- 
esting account of " The Battle of the Wilderness," 
which is now appearing in the " Atlantic Monthly," will 
be published in book-form later in the year. 

Mr. J. S. Snaith, the author of " Araminta," 
" William Jordan, Junior," etc., has completed his new 
novel, " Fortune." It is quite a new departure, being a 
martial romance of the Middle Ages in Spain. 

A new novel by the author of " The Post Girl " 
(Mr. Edward C. Booth) is a welcome announcement. 
" The Doctor's Lass " is its title ; and the scenes will be 
laid in Yorkshire — as in Mr. Booth's first novel. 

The two parts of "The Historie of Henrie the 
Fourth," edited by Mr. F. J. Furnivall, form twp vol- 
umes of the " Old-Spelling Shakespeare," as published 
in the " Shakespeare Library " by Messrs Duffield & Co. 

A new and more popular edition of Herbert Spencer's 
complete works, in attractive form at a moderate price, 
announced by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co., is an inter- 
esting indication of the increasing vogue of our great 
modern English philosopher. 

One of the more important serious books of the com- 
ing season will be the " History of the Confederate 
War," by Mr. George Cary Eggleston, which the 
Sturgis & Walton Company promise for Spring publi- 
cation. The work will be in two volumes. 

The " Diary of James K. Polk," expected last Fall, 
is announced for early Spring publication by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. It will be issued in three large 
octavo volumes of 400 pages each, with two frontispiece 
reproductions of hitherto unpublished portraits. 

A uniform edition of the writings of " Fiona Mac- 
leod" (William Sharp) is now in course of preparation 
by Messrs. Duffield & Co. "Pharais" and "The 
Mountain Lovers " make up the first volume of this 
series, and are supplied with editorial comment by the 
widow of the author. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons import for the 
American market Volume II. of Mr. Lewis F. Day's 
" Nature and Ornament," the third edition of the same 
author's work upon " Windows " (stained and painted 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

glass), and "The Collector's Handbook to Keramics of 
the Renaissance and Modern Periods," by Mr. William 
Chaffers, being a selection from his larger work entitled 
" The Keramic Gallery." 

Messrs. Duffield & Company have made arrange- 
ments to publish in this country henceforth all the 
novels by the English novelist, Mr. H. de Vere Stac- 
poole, author of " The Blue Lagoon." " The Crimson 
Azaleas," the latest offering of this writer, will be fol- 
lowed by another novel in the Autumn. 

An important volume on " China and the Far East " 
is announced for early publication by Messrs. Thomas 
Y. Crowell & Co. It is not the product of one man's 
pen, but is the result of a series of lectures before Clark 
University, by the most prominent officials and scholars 
wbo have lived in the East, or made special study of 
the subject. The volume is edited by Professor George 
H. Blakeslee. 

When " The Bride of the Mistletoe," the first book 
from Mr. James Lane Allen in six years, appeared last 
year, another work by him was promised for the near 
future. This promise is now fulfilled by the announce- 
ment for spring publication of " A Brood of the Eagle." 
As in the others of Mr. Allen's stories, the scene is rural 
Kentucky; and the work is expected to be, in a way, a 
sequel to the book first named. 

On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the 
proclamation of the kingdom of Italy, Leo S. Olschki, 
the Florentine publisher and bookseller, will issue a 
monumental edition of the " Divina Commedia," which 
it is aimed to make worthy, in scholarship and beauty, 
of the anniversary it memorializes. A new life of the 
poet by Gabriele D'Annunzio will precede the text. 
Count Passerini, editor of Olschki's " Giornale Dan- 
tesco," will supply a comprehensive commentary, which 
is to be printed on each page, parallel with the text ; and 
the editorial revision of the text itself promises to be thor- 
ough. The book will be printed on hand-made paper, 
especially manufactured by Miliani of Fabriano, with 
Dante's head in the water mark. It will be a royal 
folio, of about six hundred pages, with broad margins. 
The leather binding, with bronze hinges, etc., is de- 
scribed as of the finest Italian craftsmanship. The 
edition is limited to three hundred copies. The work 
will be ready for delivery next autumn. Messrs. 
Lemcke & Buechner are the American agents. 

The following new volumes have been added to the 
series of " Crowell's Shorter French Texts : " Quatre 
Contes des Mille et L'ne Nuits," edited by Mr. R. de 
Blanchaud; " Contes du Petit Chateau," by Jean Mace", 
edited by Mr. J. E. Mansion; "Le Chateau de la Vie," 
by E. Laboulaye, edited by Mr. R. T. Currell; Hugo's 
" Le Bataille de Waterloo " (from " Les Misdrables "), 
edited by Mr. R. P. Jago; "Anecdotes sur Napoleon," 
by Marco de Saint-Hilaire, edited by Mr. A. Auzas; 
Scribe's " Mon Etoile," edited by Mr. Neil S. Snod- 
grass; "Deux Come*dies Enfantines," by M. Reichen- 
bach, edited by Mr. J. E. Mansion ; " La Belle au Bois 
Dormant," dramatized by Emma Fisher, and edited by 
Mr. F. G. Harriman; " Croisilles," by Alfred de Musset, 
edited by Mr. S. Tyndall ; " Les Petites Ignorances de 
la Conversation," by Charles Rozan, edited by Mr. R. 
de Blanchaud ; and " La Farce de Paquin Fils," by L. 
Lailavoix. Each of these little books has an introduc- 
tion, notes, exercises, and a vocabulary. They provide 
the teacher with reading-matter which is mostly un- 
hackneyed, at a small price.

Gertrude Halls's The Unknown Quantity 

A story of love and moral struggle, in which the mystery suggested in the opening chapter is so skilfully handled that 
the reader makes and unmakes his mind as often as the hero does. 

A young widow comes to New York to investigate various business interests of her late husband, and finds herself face to 
face at the outset with the two most vital problems of a woman's life. She solves these problems in a way of her own, not 
the less moving because it is thoroughly human. 

Essentially an American story : The people are alive ; the talk individual to the speaker whether it be a leader of New 
York's grayest society or the stenographer who follows her afar off, the climber who fails, or the woman who knows no New 
York beyond her own circle, the artist with ideals and — a family, the successful city lawyer, or the boy who apes the self- 
indulgent club man. 

The author's short stories have appeared in the best magazines.

Economic Prizes 

SEVENTH YEAR 

In order to arouse an interest in the study of topics relating to commerce and industry, and to 
stimulate those who have a college training to consider the problems of a business career, a committee 
composed of 

Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, University of Chicago, Chairman; 
' Professor J. B. Clark, Columbia University; 
Professor Henry C. Adams, University of Michigan; 
Horace White, Esq., New York City, and 
Professor Edwin F. Gay, Harvard University, 

has been enabled, through the generosity of Messrs. Hart Schaffner & Marx, of Chicago, to offer in 
1911 four prizes for the best studies in the economic field. 

In addition to the subjects printed below, a list of available subjects proposed in past years can 
be had on application. Attention is expressly called to the rule that a competitor is not confined to 
topics proposed in the announcements of this committee ; but any other subject chosen must first be 
approved by it. 

1. The history of the rate of interest in the United States. 

2. The value of protectionism to American workingmen. 

3. The economic reasons for or against building a deep waterway from the Lakes to the Gulf. 

4. German experience in taxing the unearned increment from land. 

5. The valuation of railways. 

6. An examination of government wages statistics. 

7. The effects of modern immigration in the United States. 

8. The value of organized speculation. 

Class B includes only those who, at the time the papers are sent in, are undergraduates of any 
American college. Class A includes any other Americans without restriction; the possession of a degree 
is not required of any contestant in this class, nor is any age limit set. 

A First Prize of One Thousand Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Five Hundred Dollars 

are offered to contestants in Class A. 

A First Prize of Three Hundred Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Two Hundred Dollars 

are offered to contestants in Class B. The committee reserves to itself the right to award the two 
prizes of $1000 and $500 of Class A to undergraduates in Class B, if the merits of the papers 
demand it. 

The ownership of the copyright of successful studies will vest in the doners, and it is expected that, without 
precluding the use of these papers as theses for higher degrees, they will cause them to be issued in some perma- 
nent form. 

Competitors are advised that the studies should be thorough, expressed in good English, and although not limited 
as to length, they should not be needlessly expanded. They should be inscribed with an assumed name, the class in which 
they are presented, and accompanied by a sealed envelope giving the real name and address of the competitor. If the 
competitor is in Class B, the sealed envelope should contain the name of the institution in which he is studying. The 
papers should be sent on or before June 1, 1911, to

LITERARY CENSORSHIP. 



How far is it legitimate for authority to go in 
regulating the liberties of the public with respect 
to their habits, their diversions, and the indul- 
gence of their individual tastes in general ? Be- 
tween the extremes of fanatical intolerance and 
unbridled license there are many intermediate 
degrees ; at what point in the series may we find 
the golden mean which shall protect the unwary 
from actual peril, and which yet shall curb no 
innocent inclination? The question is far- 
reaching, and instances in point are abundantly 
supplied to the student either of history or of 
present social conditions. Authority always 
tends to abuse its power, and eternal vigilance 
is the price of many kinds of liberty that lie 
wholly without the political sphere. The aims 
of the fanatic or the doctrinaire are no less 
repugnant to sanity than are the easy-going 
ideals of the philosophy of laisser faire as 
applied to the vicious propensities of mankind. 
But in all doubtful cases, we think that the 
burden of proof lies upon the shoulders of those 
who advocate restriction ; for individual freedom 
of thought and action is far too precious a thing, 
and has been achieved by civilization at far too 
heavy a cost, to be subjected to the risk of 
unnecessary impairment. There are no more 
pestiferous people on earth than those who, 
clothed in a little brief authority, seek to misuse 
it by forcing its unfortunate subjects to conform 
to their own narrow ideas of conduct. 

The long chapter of folly and failure which 
records the history of restrictive and sumptu- 
ary and prohibitive law-making is highly in- 
structive in its teaching, and its lessons have to 
be learned anew through bitter experience by 
every new generation. In matters of purely 
intellectual concern, it gives us warning exam- 
ples in the form of trials for heresy, actions 
against sedition, and all kinds of restraints upon 
the press, the pulpit, and the platform. The 
very idea of censorship has become suspect, so 
uniformly has the practice been associated with 
the suppression of ideas that had far better been 
left free to find vent. And yet. if the question 
is pressed home, there is probably no individu- 
alist so confirmed as to deny the social necessity 
of setting some limits to freedom of expression. 
Society cannot, considering its own safety, per-

mit open incitement to what is universally rec- 
ognized as crime, or open encouragement to 
what all but the hopelessly perverted will admit 
to be dangerous immorality. These considera- 
tions, however, would have to be stretched out 
of all shape to justify so ridiculous an institu- 
tion as the long-established licensing of plays 
in England, or the more recent effort on the 
part of the great English libraries to inaugurate 
a system of censorship over current literature. 

The censorship of the English stage is not 
likely to last much longer in anything like its 
old form, for it has been so riddled by the pro- 
tests of practically the entire guild of dramatic 
authorship that it is obviously crumbling into a 
ruin. A system that makes it impossible to 
produce " The Cenci " on an English stage, that 
creates difficulties in the case of Ibsen, and that 
has nothing to say about the license of the music 
halls, the imbecilities of musical comedy, or the 
viciousness of works that make a jest of every- 
thing that is fundamental to morality, — such 
a system can hardly expect to find serious 
defenders. If it be not swept away altogether, 
the substitute devised for it will not continue to 
put a premium upon the most degrading tend- 
encies of the modern stage, while prohibiting 
the earnest discussion of vital questions. No 
regulation at all would be far better than the 
old legalized hypocrisy, and the police could 
take care of really flagrant offences against 
decency. 

An attempted censorship of books just now 
shares the attention of the English public with 
the long-debated question of the licensing of 
plays. It is an effort on the part of the great 
circulating libraries to save their customers from 
contamination by books deemed unsuitable for 
general reading. This private and self-appointed 
censorship has aroused no little indignation, not 
only among publishers, who think themselves 
quite as competent censors as anybody else, but 
among intelligent readers as well, who naturally 
resent such misguided paternalism. It is a 
rather serious matter ; for the sales of a pub- 
lisher in England depend largely upon the atti- 
tude of the libraries, which purchase new books 
by the hundreds and thousands of copies. In 
the case of many a book, the library orders are 
necessary to make its publication profitable, 
since the sales to private buyers alone would not 
suffice to cover the cost of production. The 
libraries have sought to establish a modus 
vivendi by requesting that books be submitted 
to their august consideration in advance of pub- 
lication, and on this will be based the approval 



or rejection of them for library circulation. But 
this scheme seems rather hard on the publishers, 
who will have incurred a considerable part of the 
expense of bringing out a book before the ver- 
dict of the libraries is made known. If books 
are to be censored at all in this fashion, it should 
obviously be done in manuscript, while there 
is time for a publisher to withdraw from what 
may be a disastrous enterprise. Besides, such 
a method savors altogether too much of the 
" leave to print " which is associated with the 
most obnoxious form of ecclesiastical tyranny. 

The system seems, however, to be already in 
limited operation, and two novels have recently 
been placed upon this new Index Librorum 
Prohibitorum. The London " Nation " thus 
comments upon the incident : 

" The library censorship has already fallen into the 
trap which, in the present condition of English letters, 
awaits all censorship, literary or theatrical. It has 
assumed as its standard a certain type of marketable 
article, and has decided that it will not countenance 
any deviations from that standard. Two books have 
been refused circulation; whether by way of the major 
or the minor excommunication, by a refusal to sell 
them, or to recommend them for sale unless they hap- 
pen to be specially asked for, we do not know. Neither, 
so far as we can discover, contains a gross word or an 
alluring description." 

Contrasting this work with work that has no 
difficulty in escaping censure, the writer goes 
on to say : 

" If it is to be compared with the kind of fiction 
which the old commercial freedom and the new com- 
mercial censorship (and they are mere varieties of the 
same spirit) usually encourages, the contrast is in the 
main between work which is moral in intention and in 
effect, and work which has no kind of moral aim or 
result, between meretricious, venal, and absurdly un- 
christian writing, and the effort to represent things as 
they are, or to discover regenerative forces wherever 
they may exist." 

The conclusion of the discussion is tersely put : 

"The libraries, indeed, are following the path set 
them by Mr. Redford. It will lead to disaster." 

Fortunately, no question of this sort can arise 
in our own country. We are a people of private 
book-buyers who, for better or worse, will pur- 
chase the books that we wish to read. No pri- 
vate library trust seeks to regulate our tastes 
and determine what is good for us. On the 
other hand, our public libraries, being distinctly 
educational agencies supported by public taxa- 
tion, have a responsibility which they are bound 
to accept. Instead of giving the public the read- 
ing it wants, their plain duty is to encourage 
the better kind of reading. But this duty is per- 
formed, be it observed, not by putting particular 
books under the ban, but by selecting from the 



1910.]

many that clamor for purchase the comparatively 
few that the resources of a given library permit 
to be purchased. Here is no conspiracy in 
restraint of the trade in imaginings, but an 
exercise of discriminative judgment on the part 
of each library, acting singly and for its own pur- 
poses. In taking this course, any library may 
blunder now and then — and grotesque examples 
of such blundering frequently come to light — 
but no book that is worth while is likely by such 
sporadic action to be kept out of the public reach 
or have its fortunes seriously impaired. Between 
this system and the English library censorship 
there is all the difference that exists between 
organized effort and free individual initiative. 



BEING A CRITIC. 



Being a critic is not all beer and skittles. The 
popular opinion of him is of one who has not 
learned any science or succeeded in any art, and is 
therefore empowered to sit in judgment on those 
who have. u Can you sing ? " asked the Maestro 
of the aspiring pupil. u No ! " " Can you play ? " 
" No ! " " Then I don't see anything for you but 
to teach music" 

As a matter of fact, nine out of ten of the good 
literary critics have been great creative artists or 
philosophers. A critic can hardly have too wide a 
range of knowledge. The literatures, philosophies, 
sciences, and arts of the world must be measurably 
well known to him. And he must have experience of 
nature and humanity, so that he can check his texts. 
Of course it is not to be expected that he shall know 
all these matters as well as the separate practitioners 
of them know each one, — nor is it necessary. To 
compare, to contrast, to bring together widely sepa- 
rated works and ideas, to trace the analogies between 
things, to arrive at underlying principles, — these 
are the offices of the critic. The specializing is 
almost the opposite of the critical mind. The mere 
analysis or appreciation of single works, unless 
backed up by such broad knowledge, or dictated by 
some rare instinctive taste, is apt to be hurtful rather 
than helpful. And minute knowledge in one direc- 
tion alone does not help much. It is doubtless a 
solace and a joy to know Anglo-Saxon, but it is 
something better to be able to detect in Caedmon 
the beginning of that high and haughty English 
strain, that Titanism, which comes out in Marlowe, 
Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron, — all of whom 
were, in Cardinal Newman's phrase, u great and 
rebellious sons of God." 

But there is a special training which a critic 
ought to have, even though he is an inspired appre- 
ciator. It consists of a study of the basic elements 
of literature which the great critics of the past have 
dug up, and of the casual utterances or well con- 
sidered opinions on their art which great writers 



have thrown out. To go without these would be 
like a player trying to dispense with the traditions 
of the stage; like a man trying to be a great lawyer 
with only the knowledge of the Statute-book of his 
own State. And the mass of this opinion is to-day 
so great that to know it is a business in itself. It is 
not to be supposed that anyone can keep it all in his 
head at once. The real critic will have tried to read 
most of it, but he will keep the best and let the rest 
go. It is probable that he will be able to stand 
an examination on the Kadapais of Aristotle, or Les- 
sing's demarcation of poetry and painting, or Schil- 
ler's definition of art as the play instinct and his 
distinction between the Beautiful and the Charac- 
teristic, or Coleridge's explanation of Imagination 
and Fancy, or De Quincey's differentiation of the 
Literature of Power and the Literature of Knowl- 
edge, or Arnold's phrases about the Grand Style 
and Natural Magic. But just what the Daciers said 
in the fight between the supporters of Ancient and 
Modern Literature, or what John Dennis thought of 
Dryden or the German criticism of Bodmer and 
Gottsehed, may well escape him. Yet all this mass 
of past criticism and opinion is like the leaves which 
have fallen, the trees which have rotted, the rocks 
which have disintegrated; and, once taken into the 
mind, it forms a humus or soil in which new crops 
can be grown. 

There are two large works in English which to- 
gether sum up the whole course or growth of literary 
opinion. They are Bosanquet's History of ^Esthetics 
and Mr. Saintsbury's History of Criticism. The 
difference between these two books, apparently 
parallel, is amazing. Bc-anquet tunnels under- 
ground ; he dives into the caverns of metaphysic 
and psychology, — he spares no labor. Mr. Saints- 
bury skims along the surface, skips from flower to 
flower, and declines to meddle with anything that 
looks ugly or forbidding. Bosanquet's book is one 
of the most difficult in the language ; it is harder 
than his originals, because, of course, he has to con- 
dense whole theories and treatises into a few para- 
graphs or pages. Mr. Saintsbury's book is written 
in a lively and exhilarating style, and is itself liter- 
ature. But Bosanquet goes to the root of the matter, 
and reports in a colorless and unprejudiced way all 
the deepest divinations of the ages. Mr. Saints- 
bury is, in spite of his vast erudition, shallow ia 
treatment, and from first to last is the victim of a 
preconceived theory of his own. Reading Mr. 
Saintsbury is like indulging in a long course of 
sugar-plums which is pretty sure to disorder the 
stomach ; reading Bosanquet is like taking repeated 
doses of senna and quassia to set it right again. Mr. 
Sidney Colvin's little treatise on the Fine Arts is 
perhaps a mean between these two works, and will 
give anyone a fair idea of the questions which criti- 
cism propounds and tries to answer. 

But there are certain texts of criticism which the 
modern critic must know for himself. One of these 
is Aristotle's " Poetics." It is probably a fragment, 
as it does not cover the whole range of Greek liter- 



138

[March 1, 



ature. Excepting some scattered and generally 
slighting remarks on poetry in Plato, and the lively 
and just appreciations of tragic poetry in "The 
Frogs " of Aristophanes, it is the earliest extant 
document of criticism. And it is the best. It is, 
indeed, the corner-stone of all sound criticism. No- 
where else is there so much pregnancy and pro- 
fundity; such keen analysis of literature and its 
relation to life. The greater part of Aristotle's 
judgments are as valid to-day as when they were 
written. A second great foundation of criticism is 
Lessing's " LaocoOn." Taken as a survey of litera- 
ture, it is even more fragmentary than the " Poetics," 
for it deals mainly with one point — the differentia- 
tion of the matter and powers of poetry and painting. 
But the white light of truth which it sheds on this 
subject pierces to the farthest cranny of literature. 

Longinus is the ancient type of the inspired appre- 
ciator — the man of taste rather than of analysis. 
The greatest critic of this kind in modern times is 
probably Goethe. The discursive remarks on litera- 
ture and art scattered through his autobiography, his 
essays, letters, conversations with Eckermann, form 
as large a body of good criticism as exists anywhere. 
But the difference between his way of criticising and 
Lessing's is immense. The latter pierced to one cen- 
tral truth, good for all time ; developed it, and made 
it immovable. Goethe shifts his point of view 
around and around : now he sees the shield gold, 
now silver ; now he is Gothic, now Greek. Pretty 
much all his work in criticism may be, and in fact 
has been, done over. Take for example his criti- 
cism on Hamlet, in " Wilhelm Meister." Fine as 
this is, it has been pretty well riddled by recent 
analysis. 

Schiller is of the school of Aristotle and Lessing 
and Kant. His " ^Esthetic Letters " are a mine of 
rich discoveries in criticism. The Schlegels are 
perhaps more remarkable for the pupils they taught 
and inspired than for their own work, good as this 
is. Heine is the King's jester of criticism — Lear's 
Fool — who says the wisest things under the guise of 
mocking folly. Nearly all the great German phi- 
losophers — Kant, Schelling, Hegel — have discussed 
the aesthetic problems. Schopenhauer is as great 
in criticism as in philosophy. He has such skill in 
words that he can make our dissolution into nothing- 
ness seem a delight, and he paints the martyrdom 
of genius so attractively that one would not wish to 
be spared a single nail of the cross. The vast mass 
of Richard Wagner's prose works contains much 
penetrating and true criticism. He was a great man 
of letters, a great dramatic poet, by the grace of 
God, — a musician, I should say, by the determina- 
tion of Richard Wagner. 

England must take off its hat to Germany in 
criticism, as Germany must go down on its knees 
to England in creation. For foundation criticism^ 
the establishment of first principles, there is no 
equality between them ; and in the gathering of seed- 
bearing vitalities of thought, England has hardly 
been more than a gleaner in the field where Ger- 



many has reaped a full harvest. Even so, there are 
important discoveries and distinctions in Coleridge, 
DeQuincey, and Arnold. But in appreciation, the 
comparison of writer with writer, of epoch with 
epoch, England is rich enough. In the works of 
Hazlitt, for instance, while there is, I suppose, 
hardly a sentence which goes to the bottom, hardly 
a truth which really teaches, what zest, what gusto, 
what picture, what reflection and reverberation of 
his subjects, what inspiration to a love for literature! 
He is, in fact, the typical English-writing critic, — 
for our masters in this trade have mainly desired 
to bring to our lips the rich full-bodied wine of lit- 
erature, rather than to offer to our hands a vial of 
biting acid with which we might analyze master- 
pieces and see what they are made of. Yet Cole- 
ridge's prism decomposes, and Arnold's phrases 
disintegrate; and they are the greatest of English- 
writing critics. 

American criticism has followed, in the main, the 
English human rather than the German abstract 
method. It has great names in Emerson, Lowell, 
Stedman. Each of these has been, in his own way, 
a sort of camera obscura reproducing in miniature 
the varied hues and forms of the literatures of the 
world. Poe flocked by himself, and was analytic. 
I think he was nearly always wrong in his princi- 
ples and nearly always right in his practice of criti- 
cism. Lanier, who acquired some reputation as a 
critic, is wrong in both respects. The man who 
could prostrate himself before George Eliot like a 
South Sea Islander before his fetish, and could 
recommend that Sterne and Fielding be thrown into 
the sewer, has no critical authority which anyone 
is bound to respect. 

"France, famed in all great arts, in none supreme," 
is not even supreme in criticism, in which it has 
made so great an effort. Of its criticism of the 
past, the schools of Boileau and Voltaire, no one 
would have much to say now. It has wit and it has 
good sense, and it is utterly uninspired. The best 
of this kind is Moliere's manly good sense in " Les 
Pre'cieuses Ridicules," " Le Misanthrope," and " Les 
Femmes Savantes." But France's recent criticism 
has a great name. Sainte-Beuve is acclaimed a 
prince in the profession. Lowell, I imagine, was 
thinking of him when in one of his last papers he 
coined the phrase "detective criticism." I should 
prefer to call it the criticism of gossip. It is bio- 
graphical in intent; and as there are a hundred 
people who want to know about a poet's love affairs, 
or how much money he had in his purse, to one who 
cares anything for his verses, this sort of criticism 
has been popular. Sainte-Beuve has of course deli- 
cacy, finesse, justness of mind. But he deals by 
preference with second-rate or third-rate or tenth- 
rate geniuses. A really great writer frightens him 
as much as Snug thought his personation of the 
lion would frighten the ladies. Taine rather goes 
to the other extreme. He is somewhat like a boy 
who gets drunk for fear he should be thought a 
mollycoddle. He is so determined that everybody

he writes about shall be in a passion, that he makes 
us think that the great writers were always shouting 
at the top of their voices. But he has a genuine 
feeling for greatness, and despite his Procrustean 
method is usually right in his sense of proportion. 

To me, Victor Hugo's book on Shakespeare is 
more important than the whole of Sainte-Beuve. 
Arnold made good fun of its occasional rhodomon- 
tade, and the invariable implied winding up of the 
innumerable roll-calls of poets and prophets with 
" and Victor Hugo." But it is noble in its belief in 
nobility, great in its advocacy of greatness. And it 
has delicacies which surpass those of Sainte-Beuve 
as much as the hangings of the dawn surpass those 
of a ballroom. Beside Hugo, Sainte-Beuve's atti- 
tudes and graces are as those of a dancing-master to 
the pose of a king. It is true that Sainte-Beuve can 
probably be trusted to have read a good deal of the 
qooks he criticised ; whereas one always harbors the 
suspicion that Hugo, like Mr. Boffin's mentor, had 
not gone right slap through his poets and prophets 
and historians very recently. 

Instinctive taste and the analytic faculty — these 
are the two qualifications for a critic. The fault 
with taste is its want of certitude. It may be right 
or it may be wrong, and it changes from age to age, 
almost from season to season. " I don't know 
anything about art, but I know what I like," — that 
is the natural human cry. Taste offers assertion 
without argument, opinion without proof ; its value 
in the end must depend on whether it is backed up 
by previous analysis. By itself, analysis is dry 
enough. It does not appeal, but it carries. It pre- 
serves the proportion and significance of things, and 
keeps mankind from straying too far after false gods.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A PUBLISHER WITH AN ENVIABLE RECORD for 

honorable dealing, sane and conservative methods, 
dignified restraint, real service to the cause of lit- 
erature and learning, and a good degree of pecun- 
iary success therewith, has recently rounded out his 
threescore and ten years of life and forty-five of 
business experience, and has marked the occasion 
with some unusually interesting professional rem- 
iniscences in a late number of "The Publishers' 
Weekly." Mr. Henry Holt, whose name on the 
" Leisure Hour Series " is familiar to novel-readers, 
as it is to science-readers on the " American Science 
Series," and to naturalists on the " American Nature 
Series," and to other wide circles of readers on the 
works of Taine, Mill, Maine, ten Brink, Austin 
Dobson, and many other world-famous authors, 
relates how he (with abundant precedent and illus- 
trious example to encourage him) forsook law for 
literature at an early age and became a manufac- 
turer of books at the same time that he was, in a 
modest way, a writer of them. His authorship of 



two remarkably good novels, M Calmire, Man and 
Nature," and " Sturmsee, Man and Man," first 
issued anonymously, is now generally known. The 
rise of Mr. Holt's publishing house, under its vari- 
ous designations, is an instructive history of the 
increasing success and reputation of a wisely and 
honorably conducted business. Naturally enough, 
Mr. Holt dwells with fond retrospection upon the 
principles and policies of his earlier associates in 
publishing, and laments the competition and greed 
and questionable practices of these latter days, 
when the issuing of books is no longer the dignified 
profession it once was — to the present detriment 
of all concerned. " I suspect," he declares, M that 
whatever may be the case with the industrial and 
educational branches of publishing, the belles-lettres 
branch has got to be conducted as a profession, or 
there is no money in it. The old fortunes in the 
business were built up on this principle. Appar- 
ently the fine flavor of literature will not stand 
being dragged through the deeper mires of competi- 
tion." All will join in Mr. Holt's hope that, despite 
his seventy years, he may " continue in evidence 
some time longer " in the trade which he has so 
long honored, and has done so much to elevate to 
the dignity of a profession. 

William Everett, teacher, preacher, au- 
thor, lecturer, and publicist, the third son of 
Edward Everett, whose gift of oratory he in a 
marked degree inherited, and best known as prin- 
cipal, for nearly thirty years, of the Adams Acad- 
emy at Quincy, died at his home in that " city of 
presidents " on the sixteenth of February, at the age 
of seventy. Educated at the Boston Latin School, 
Harvard College, Trinity College, Cambridge, and 
at the Dane Law School, and admitted to the bar 
as well as licensed to preach, Mr. Everett's intel- 
lectual interests and his abilities were wide and 
varied. A tutorship in Latin at Harvard was soon 
succeeded by an assistant professorship, and this, in 
1878, by the principalship of the preparatory school 
which he made famous for its thorough and schol- 
arly work. His excursions into politics, including 
a term in Congress, his spirited championship of 
the Mugwump cause, and his stalwart independence 
at all times and on all questions, are matters of 
record. What more nearly concerns us here are his 
fine Latin and Greek scholarship, his unexcelled 
mastery of his own language in both speaking and 
writing, and his contributions to literature, including 
his " College Essays," « On the Cam," and, for 
young readers, " Double Play," " Changing Base," 
and "Thine, not Mine." His many courses of 
Lowell Institute lectures, notably his last year's 
series on eighteenth-century British oratory, should 
not be forgotten. He is said to have finished, a 
short time before his death, a biography of his 
father, and also a book inspired by a vision of peace 
and war. It is to b e hoped that both works will 
soon appear in print.

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



Poe's prospects of a place in the Hall of 
Fame of the New York University are considerably 
brighter than they have been. Five years have 
passed since the failure, by nine votes, to inscribe 
his name in our American Valhalla ; and sixteen 
vacancies have in the meantime been created and 
filled in the Board of Electors, the present compo- 
sition of which is regarded as preponderatingly in 
Poe's favor. Nominations of candidates for immor- 
tality are, by the rules, to be placed in the hands of 
these hundred electors on the first of May, and on 
the first of October the ballots will be cast. It 
would be passing strange if Poe should again be 
voted down. To foreign observers, especially, it 
would be hardly short of scandalous. In a current 
article, of considerable weight, in the " Edinburgh 
Review," Poe's genius is made the subject of a 
lengthy study. " Edgar Poe, World-Author," was 
the heading that Professor Charles F. Richardson 
chose for the prefatory sketch to his late edition of 
Poe's complete works. " Taking five representa- 
tive libraries of world-literature," he writes, as 
quoted in the Review, " in English, German, and 
Italian, Poe's is the only name appearing in all 
five " — the only American name, we assume. And 
again : " In many a little German, Austrian, or 
Italian bookshop, he stands as the sole representa- 
tive of the literature of his native land." Whether 
or not he chances to be among one's personal favor- 
ites, Poe's fame and influence and enduring popu- 
larity are such as to render ridiculous any official 
attempt at a denial of his eminence. 



The books that are always out, when we 
apply for them at the public library, must be in some 
fortunate hands ; but in whose ? Library workers 
are familiar with the half-resentful, half -in credulous 
expression that comes over the applicant's face when 
told for the ninth time that Mrs. Ward's " Marriage 
a la Mode," or Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith's "Peter " 
is not in. " Other people get what they want at the 
library ; I don't see why I never can," murmurs the 
disappointed card-holder, as he finally makes the best 
of Thackeray's "Henry Esmond " or Trollope's " Bar- 
chester Towers." A suspicion seems often to be cher- 
ished by the unsuccessful applicant for a recent and 
popular book that the desired work is maliciously 
kept from him, or is being read at leisure by the 
library trustees and employees before being put into 
general circulation ; or, not uncommonly, the library 
page is held guilty of carelessness in overlooking the 
book and of reporting it as out when it is really in. 
The Leith Walk Library, in Edinburgh, is one of the 
comparatively few present-day libraries that use the 
cumbersome " indicator " to inform applicants what 
books are available at any given moment — at least 
among those most in demand. A recent visitor to 
this library was told that this bulky and antiquated 
piece of equipment is deemed necessary in Scotland 
because the Scotch are proverbially snspicious and 
demand some sort of ocular evidence that a coveted 



volume is actually not at hand. Many Bostonians 
will recall the blackboard-like indicator in use thirty- 
five years ago at the Boston Public Library, and will 
remember the sinking of the heart which followed 
the discovery, in black, and not in white, of a number 
representing a longed-for book. 

A plea for true biography, made recently by 
Mr. Edmund Gosse before the members of the 
London Institution, deserves a place beside Pro- 
fessor Hart's late address in favor of unfalsified 
history. One may not go all the way with Mr. 
Gosse in his demand for naked truth in its every 
detail ; yet the fact remains that the greatest biog- 
raphy in the English language is noted for its 
unsparing, realistic treatment of its subject. Still, 
not all men are so interesting and so lovable in their 
little weaknesses and failings as Dr. Samuel John- 
son, even supposing them to be attended by accur- 
ately observing and truth-telling Boswells. A few 
of Mr. Gosse's own words will make clear his con- 
victions in this matter. " I will even dare to say," 
he declares in regard to the biographer, "that his 
anxiety should be, not to avoid indiscretion, but to 
be as indiscreet as possible, within the boundaries 
of good taste [but who shall fix those boundaries ? j 
and good feeling. He should start determined to 
reveal as far as possible, to drag the coy, retreating 
subject into the light of day." The speaker then 
referred to the conflicting motives, the wish to in- 
struct and the desire to amuse, the result being 
commonly that the subject is presented "in a tight 
frock coat, with a glass of water in his hand and 
one elbow on a desk, in the act of preparing to say, 
* Ladies and gentlemen.' " Nevertheless even Mr. 
Gosse would probably admit that much is now being 
written, in the shape of personal reminiscences of 
the great, that errs on the side of trivial detail. 
After all, the biographer, with the genuine gift of 
minutely faithful and at the same time grandly in- 
spiring biography, is born, not made. 

The solitariness of Maurice Maeterlinck is 
considered by some who have studied his character 
one of his most marked characteristics. It is a trite 
observation that the mountain heights attained by 
men of the loftiest genius are in an atmosphere too 
rarefied for ordinary mortals to breathe, and conse- 
quently this aloofness is necessarily common to all 
leaders in the realm of ideals. M. Gerard Harry, in 
a recent volume devoted to the study of the famous 
mystic, finds in his aloofness the key that unlocks 
the man's character and his work. He hesitates 
whether to ascribe this quality to " the fear of being 
too unlike the majority of men to be understood by 
them," to " the voluptuous sense of plenitude which 
the vision acquires at unfrequented altitudes," or to 
"the instinctive repulsion which the parade and 
ostentation of the frivolous living of the period must 
inspire in one who explores the abyss too profoundly 
to be able to take seriously the agitated swarmings 
of the surface " — or, finally, to all three of these 



1910.]

probable causes. One need not, however, be a 
Maeterlinck to appreciate the luxury of solitude and 
the calm delight of self-communing. Even so con- 
vivial a soul as Sir Walter Scott has left it on record 
that if he were forced to choose between eternal 
society and eternal solitude he would tell the jailer 
to turn the key and leave him alone. 
• • • 
The slow but sure progress of the Oxford 
Dictionary is brought to our notice by the appear- 
ance, at irregular intervals, of a new volume. Dr. 
Murray's great work, the greatest ever undertaken 
in English lexicography, has now advanced, in its 
seventh volume, to the end of the letter P, and hopes 
are entertained that Q and R will be disposed of in 
the present year. Thus there is good ground for 
expecting that men now living will see the comple- 
tion of this scholarly and useful publication. But 
(melancholy thought) the dictionary of a living lan- 
guage, like the catalogue of a growing library, is no 
sooner published than it is out of date — a disability 
that becomes more serious with every passing day. 
Among the more interesting entries under P in 
the Oxford Dictionary is the word " psychological," 
especially as used in the expression, "the psycho- 
logical moment," now conceded to be a blundering 
translation, or application, of the German das psy- 
chologische moment (that is, the psychological mo- 
mentum, or impulse). It is probable, however, that 
in defiance of logic " the psychological moment," 
like " the personal equation," will continue to enjoy 
an undeserved reputation for peculiar aptness and 
force. 

The metrical instinct, the impulse to express 
oneself in verse rather than in prose, is almost a 
primitive instinct, manifesting itself in all literatures 
before the development of a prose style. It is 
natural, therefore, that many of the crude attempts, 
both printed and unprinted, of ambitious young 
people to achieve the dignity of authorship should 
take (or endeavor to take) metrical form. But the 
reader of these zealous efforts must often wonder 
what the writers' notions of rhyme and metre really 
are, or whether they consciously possess any such 
notions. The Sunday issue of a metropolitan news- 
paper which is indulgent toward embryonic poets 
lately printed on a single page ten of these amateur 
effusions in verse — or in what bore the outward 
appearance of verse. The first of them, under the 
promising title, " Glorified «by Love," canters along 
briskly for a line or two, then abruptly halts, then 
breaks into a walk, alternating gaits in a bone- 
shaking fashion throughout. The first line runs, 
not unglibly : " Today as I was passing through the 
busy scenes of town" — a good, swinging metre; 
but before the end of the second line is reached 
(" I saw an humble mendicant, crouching, head 
bowed down ") the rhythm disappointingly halts, 
though the rhyme is irreproachable. A little further 
on, however, the poet suffers ignominious defeat in 
both particulars. A sufficiently fluent line, " But as 



I stood condemned, yet weak, unable to give help," 
is thus feebly supported: "Two brothers stalked 
across my path — they in duty forgot self." Do 
verse-endings such as these, we wonder, answer each 
other's call for help — in the writer's mind ? It is 
an amusing study, that page of would-be poetry by 
contemporary authors not yet famous, and it dis- 
plays prodigious zeal, whatever its deficiency of 
knowledge. 

The finality of first impressions in the book- 
world, commercially considered, is a rule proved by 
some conspicuous exceptions. Edward FitzGerald's 
" Omar " languished in the market for years, with 
almost no sales, and had suffered the indignity of 
being marked down to a penny in the London book- 
stalls when a discerning eye caught sight of it, and 
an appreciative word gave it a wide vogue. Lew 
Wallace's " Ben-Hur " did not at first find popular 
favor, only twenty-five hundred copies being sold in 
two years. Then the tide turned, for some reason, 
in its favor, and it made a record for large sales. 
The appearance of Mr. Hall Caine's pamphlet, 
" Why I Wrote ■ The White Prophet,' " after it had 
become painfully evident that book-buyers were 
not jostling one another to secure copies of the 
Manxman's new novel, moves one to doubt whether 
the author has acted with either professional dig- 
nity or commercial wisdom. Qui s'excuse s'accuse. 
If the novel shows deficient vitality on the market, 
no amount of explanation why it should be ac- 
counted a memorable production will breathe into 
it the breath of life. 

The best-housed amateur journal in the 
world may safely be pronounced to be the "Har- 
vard Lampoon," which has just moved into its new 
forty-thousand-dollar building at the corner of Mt. 
Auburn and Bow streets, the dedication of which 
was celebrated with a grand gathering of former 
" Lampoon " editors and other dignitaries, including 
Professor Barrett Wendell, also an ex-Lampoonist, 
who addressed the assembly informally. The 
" Lampoon " dates from 1876 ; and it is one of its 
founders, Mr. Edmund M. Wheelwright, of the class 
of '76 and now practising architecture in Boston, 
who designed and supervised the erection of the 
new building. Foreign countries have been drawn 
upon for ornamental finishings to the handsome 
interior — including rare and costly furniture from 
Holland, an Elizabethan mantelpiece from England, 
leaded glass windows from Belgium, and tiles from 
Delft. Material comfort and aesthetic satisfaction 
have both been kept in mind in fitting up these 
quarters for future generations of Lampoonists. 
Long may this piquant representative of college wit 
live to excite the mirth of its readers !

The shifting sands of orthoepy are so very 
unstable that it might almost be questioned whether 
there is, after all, any such science. The other day 
in London a lecturer before the Elizabethan Society 
dwelt on the not universally understood fact that our

pronunciation is changing so rapidly that, were Shake- 
speare now alive, he would probably be unable to 
understand one of his own plays as presented on the 
modern stage. In illustration of this ceaseless change 
— a change that reveals itself in the rhymed verses 
of our poets of various periods — the lecturer adduced 
the word " time," whose pronunciation in Chaucer's 
day he represented by the spelling " teem,", in Shake- 
speare's by the spelling "tame," and in modern cock- 
ney by "toime." Instruction in English at school 
tends to hold cockneyisms in check, and acts un- 
doubtedly as a beneficent hindrance to all erratic 
tendencies in pronounciation. But no living lan- 
guage will ever crystallize into rigid and changeless 
forms, whether in grammar or spelling or mode of 
utterance. Hence the folly of hoping for a perman- 
ently satisfactory scheme of phonetic spelling. 

A library for printers, erected by printers, is 
a sort of standing refutation of the time-honored 
saying that the shoemaker's children go barefoot and 
the tailor's family dresses in rags. The Printers' 
Home at Colorado Springs, founded and maintained 
by the Union Printers of America, has just made a 
$30,000 addition to its fine buildings, in the shape 
of a library to house its excellent collection of books, 
about 11,000 in number. It is proposed to make it 
eventually far more attractive and home-like than 
the usual public library. The main building of the 
Printers' Home was dedicated in 1892, and the 
property, including extensive subsequent additions, 
is now valued at a million dollars. 



COMM UNICA TIONS. 



THE " BEST SELLER " AND THE GENTEEL 

ATMOSPHERE. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

When will there arise an author of popular fiction 
courageous enough to come forward and reveal his 
formula ? It is quite patent on the very cover of every 
successful novel, and so unvarying that it is with diffi- 
culty one distinguishes a season's books apart; yet the 
writers wink at each other, so to speak, and seem to 
imagine it a secure professional secret. 

One might have looked for some such disclosure among 
" The Confessions of a Best Seller " in a recent number 
of " The Atlantic " ; but whoever did so was disappointed. 
This anonymous author, like the rest of his craft, would 
have us believe that the " best seller " sells because of 
its absorbing plot interest. It must be a tale of incident, 
he tells us, which by reason of its plunging melodrama — 
lost messages, fights on the stairs, etc. — can give the 
tired business man an evening of self-forgetfulness. 
What a slanderous absurdity ! This may be the com- 
pelling force in paper-covered " Diamond Dicks," but 
the " Atlantic " contributor describes his novels as sell- 
ing at a dollar and eighteen cents ; and to accuse popular 
fiction at this price of real plot interest, is calumny. As 
if the American people were of so purposeless and extrav- 
agant a temperament that they would pay millions of 
dollars a year merely to be entertained ! No, we are of 
more serious stock; and the people who buy new books — 



not tired business men, but women mostly — are after 
something more than a good story, and are willing to 
pay for it; and that something is — the genteel atmo- 
sphere. 

The genteel atmosphere ! Who ever saw a " best 
seller " with a suggestion of anything so vulgar as pov- 
erty, — with a heroine who makes her own shirt-waists, 
and a hero noble and handsome but a little short of 
money! How disgusting! Such books have been written, 
it is true, and have taken a high rank in literature; but 
they are not used for window displays in the depart- 
ment stores of our time. No, the love scenes in your 
popular novel must take place in a gondola in Venice, 
and there must be a familiarity with expensive cafe's, 
and rare curios, and Italian phrases; and by all means 
let there be no mention of locomotion other than in 
automobiles — at least until aeroplanes become more 
plausible. Why is all this ? It is self-evident. We 
cannot all go to Europe, or keep a coachman ; and hence 
— the " best seller." One must somehow acquire the 
genteel atmosphere. 

But it may be objected that books which reproduce 
aristocratic society most faithfully are often not popu- 
lar; and again, the atmosphere of the successful novel 
is frequently not one of gentility at all. People of good 
breeding do not act and talk as these characters do. 
True; and I have used the term merely in a technical 
sense. For the genteel atmosphere of the " best seller " 
is a thing by itself, whose actual counterpart does not 
exist in heaven or on earth. Yet it is in the creation of 
this atmosphere that the author proves himself, not a 
clever story-teller only, but a genius. Such a book is 
based upon psychology, not fact. Its requisites are 
two: first, that the setting be unquestionably fashion- 
able; second, that the characters be dressed in all the 
trappings and suits of affluence, but underneath they 
shall be not such people as one really finds in well-bred 
society, but — the readers themselves. Otherwise your 
genteel atmosphere will be dull and incomprehensible 
to the bulk of your audience. 

What we, the buyers of " best sellers," want is not 
to stand and stare at an alien and to us stupid group of 
men and women. We want to have the rosy Utopia of 
wealth and ease presented in such a way that we can 
feel it — can imagine ourselves in the midst of it and a 
part of it. And to this end it is absolutely essential that 
the characters be at bottom very like ourselves. We 
want to be lifted gently, so that we do not feel the jar, 
from our vulgarly crowded street-car bench to the luxu- 
rious motor-car on its tour through France. We do not 
want to stand on the bank and watch the gondola, but 
to be in it ourselves, — to have the people there say and 
do the things that we imagine we should say and do if 
we found ourselves in a gondola. 

When your neighbor presses upon you the latest book, 
her enthusiastic recommendation is sure to be accom- 
panied by the apology, " There is n't much to the story, 
you know; it's the way it is told." Of course it is. 
Away with your claims of plot interest ! And by " the 
way it is told " she means that she has wiped the dish- 
water from her hands — not knowing that there may be 
more real gentility in dishwater than in a bunch of 
orchids — and has sat down to a delicious hour of " good 
society." She has covertly made note of carelessly 
dropped references to the opera and to out-of-the-way 
spots in Switzerland (they may embellish her conversa- 
tion later), and has laughed with the author over the 
inappropriateness of a hostess serving Burgundy with 



1910.]

fish. She — the reader — never serves Burgundy with 
anything; but the author does not suspect that. For 
indeed the best part of it all is the delightful way in 
which he takes you into his confidence and chats non- 
chalantly about elegant things, — never being so com- 
monplace as to suggest that you know there are people 
who do not ride in automobiles and go to Europe every 
year. Oh, it is exquisite, this bath of gentility; and 
the thing that makes it so is the fact that your neighbor 
really feels herself a part of it, — because the heroine 
is, after all, just such a person as she herself might be 
with the addition of a Worth gown to her wardrobe, a 
title to her name, and a few French phrases to her 
vocabulary. 

The author who can make this delicate connection 
most adroitly is the one who gets the most money for 
his books ; he who can reduce the life of " smart " 
society just to the plane where it will touch the imagi- 
nation of the uninitiated while still floating tantalizingly 
above their reach. After all, is it such a mean service ? 
It affords a deal of comfort in a cold and unfair world ; 
and if the instinct to imitate one's betters is snobbish 
and Philistine, so are some of the instincts on the part 
of the betters themselves. 

But thus it is that we have books sparkling with 
unbelievably trite quotations, and repartee that would 
cause nausea iu a half-way good conversationalist; this 
is why we have duchesses flirting in a manner that 
would be charming in a shop-girl, and bishops (figura- 
tively speaking) with their hats on one side of their 
heads. This is why it is, in short, that the windows of 
our department stores are full of " best sellers " decor- 
ated with a portrait of the heiress in an evening gown — 
neat little packages of genteel atmosphere at a dollar 
and eighteen cents, and cheap at the price; and why 
our popular novelist pockets his prodigious royalties for 
being, not a story-writer, but a shrewd psychologist.

A REPRODUCTION OF THE CAEDMON MS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Professor John M. Manly, during his recent visit to 
England, made arrangements with the Oxford University 
Press for the reproduction in facsimile of the Caedmon 
manucript in the Bodleian Library. The manuscript 
consists of 260 large pages, and is of especial interest, 
not only on account of the importance of the text and 
the very remarkable illustrations, but because of the 
system of metrical points, which cannot be studied to 
advantage without exact reproduction. The University 
Press have agreed to issue a collotype to subscribers at 
five guineas net ; only one hundred copies will be pub- 
lished, and it is likely that the reproduction will increase 
in value with the lapse of time. 

In cooperation with Professor Manly and Professor 
G. L. Kittredge, I brought the undertaking before the 
Modern Language Association of America at the East- 
ern meeting at Cornell University; a resolution was 
unanimously passed commending the enterprise to 
American scholars and university libraries, and request- 
ing the Committee on the Reproduction of Early Texts 
to make preliminary arrangements for publication. In 
accordance with this resolution, I am now issuing a 
circular with a form of subscription attached, which I 
shall be glad to send to anyone interested. Applica- 
tions will be filed in the order in which they are received, 



and the subscription list will be closed as soon as one 
hundred names are registered Although no general 
appeal has yet been made, I have already between 
twenty and thirty names on the subscription list.

A QUESTION OF TYPOGRAPHY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I have often felt a vague dissatisfaction at reaching 
the end of a page of poetry and finding nothing to indi- 
cate whether the last line on the page was the conclud- 
ing line of a stanza or the stanza was carried over to 
the next page. The feeling ceased to be a vague one 
the other day, when, reading a narrative poem with 
blank-verse stanzas of different lengths, I found the 
meaning obscured by uncertainty as to whether the 
completion of the page coincided with the completion 
of a thought, or the same stanza was continued when I 
turned the page. The current practice is unpleasant; 
if , as I have discovered, it may at times be confusing, 
why should not a different one be adopted ? 

It has occurred to me that a sufficient distinction is 
made by leaving the earlier page one or two lines 
shorter when the stanza is completed there, and by 
beginning a new stanza the same number of lines lower 
on the following page. This arrangement would be 
especially clear in books that are printed with marginal 
lines enclosing the text. An artist friend suggests that 
such pages are hopelessly inartistic ; but I am unable to 
see why the addition of this irregularity to the unequal 
length of line, and the prevalent practice of allowing 
stanzas to come differently on opposite pages, will 
detract from the appearance of the book. 

Perhaps a more effective contrivance would be the 
placing of a conventional symbol at the end of each 
stanza. We are not satisfied with a double space at the 
end of a sentence, but use a period. We distinguish 
broken words from completed words at the end of a 
line by a hyphen. We should in the same way find 
some means of distinguishing a broken stanza from a 
completed one at the end of a page.

A LIBRARY LIST OF THE BEST NOVELS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A list of a hundred of the best novels, representing the 
selections of prominent authors and other distinguished 
persons, rather than of an individual, should be of value 
to many readers of The Dial, especially librarians, who 
are eternally beset by the problem of what books to buy. 
Such a fist has been prepared and published by the 
Warrensburg (Mo.) Library, after many months of study 
and deliberation. It represents advice and suggestions 
from Winston Churchill, William Dean Howells, Mark 
Twain, William Allen White, Ralph Connor, Rudyard 
Kipling, James Lane Allen, and others who kindly 
assisted in its preparation. I beheve this is the only 
fiction list yet pubhshed, representing, in a systematic 
way, a consensus of opinion from high authorities. The 
list is published in a neat booklet, by the Warrensburg 
Library, and will be mailed to anyone sending fifteen 
cents for it. Mrs. R. L. AYebb.

Fifteen Years of Diplomatic Life.* 



The names Bunsen and Waddington are 
familiar to those versed in the history of Euro- 
pean diplomacy , and they are far from unfamiliar 
in the world of learning and literature. Madame 
Charles de Bunsen, whose recollections of her 
early public life have just been published under 
the title " In Three Legations," is by birth a 
Waddington — being, in fact, the sister of the 
late William Henry Waddington, scholar and 
writer as well as diplomat and statesman ; and 
her husband, Carl von Bunsen, for years in the 
Prussian diplomatic service, was the son of the 
famous Baron von Bunsen, whose varied learn- 
ing, contributions to philology and history, and 
distinguished services as representative of his 
country at various courts, are not yet quite for- 
gotten. In Madame Waddington's two excellent 
volumes of reminiscences, which were reviewed 
in these pages at the time of their publication, 
the Bunsens are frequently mentioned; and so 
the way has been paved, if it needed paving, for 
these retrospections of her sister-in-law. 

The book is made up of extracts from letters 
" written on the spot " and needing no assurance 
on the writer's part that they are spontaneous, 
sincere, and the genuine records of passing im- 
pressions. A small part of the correspondence 
has appeared in " Harper's Magazine," but all 
the rest is new. The " three legations " referred 
to in the title are the Prussian Legations at 
Turin, at Florence (when in 1864 the Tuscan 
city superseded her Piedmontese sister as capital 
of the growing Italian kingdom), and at The 
Hague ; and the time covered is from 1857 to 
1872. At Turin, Bunsen was Secretary of 
Legation, at Florence Conseiller de Legation, 
and at The Hague he acted as Minister in the 
temporary absence of Count Perponcher. It 
was an eventful period in European history, 
covering three memorable wars and witnessing 
considerable changes in the geography and the 
political constitution of several countries. 

" Curiously enough," says the author in her 
preface, " in each of our ' Three Legations ' we 
lived through the experience of a war, and were 
present at a royal marriage." Actual attendance 
at these nuptials, however, is recorded in only 
one instance, that of the union of the Prince of 
Wied with Princess Marie of the Netherlands,

in the summer of 1871, at The Hague. Of the 
other two weddings, that of Princess Marie Pia 
of Savoy and King Louis of Portugal, and the 
marriage of Prince Umberto to Margherita of 
Savoy, the writer gives short and second-hand 
accounts. The three wars were the brief clash 
between Austria on one side and Italy and 
France on the other, in 1859; the short war of 
1866, which freed Venice from Austrian rule 
and greatly increased the might and prestige 
of Prussia ; and the Franco-German war of 
1870. 

Madame de Bunsen's pages fairly bristle 
with the names of royalties and other hohe 
Herrschaften, as was to to be expected. A 
glimpse of Cavour at one of his receptions is 
obtained on an early page. 

" Cavour was doing the honors very amiably in a 
much embroidered coat. His round good-natured face 
and spectacles, as well as his short stout figure, always 
seem to me slightly disappointing. It does not answer, 
somehow, to one's idea of a great Italian statesman. 
He always makes me most gracious bows, however, 
whenever I meet him in the street, which I do fre- 
quently, as we do not live far from the Palais Cavour." 

The King (Victor Emanuel II.) she describes 
as rather fierce in appearance, and not hand- 
some, though better-looking than his portraits ; 
and she pays high tribute to his bravery in the 
war with Austria. " The King exposes himself 
dreadfully," she writes. " His entourage say 
it is just like the time of Charles Albert, only 
that the latter used to take his whole etat major 
with him, and Victor Emanuel only has a few 
officers." The following, written at Turin in 
the spring of 1861, gives an interesting picture 
of Garibaldi and other leaders of Italy. 

" I went to the famous sitting of the Chambers Satur- 
day last [when the question of incorporating Garibaldi's 
volunteers with the regular army was animatedly dis- 
cussed], stood for four hours, saw and heard Garibaldi, 
Ricasoli, Cavour, Bixio, Crispi, etc. . . . Soon Garibaldi 
came in, leaning on two friends, who sat down after- 
wards one on each side of him. He suffers from rheu- 
matism, and is very lame. As you know, it was the first 
time he took his seat in the Chamber, and he was 
received with great applause, all the deputies rising. 
He is exactly like his portraits, with fine, regular fea- 
tures, which tell well at a distance. He was dressed in 
a red shirt, of course, over which he had a grey cloak 
falling in picturesque folds; his whole appearance was 
somewhat theatrical. ... He has a splendid voice, 
which filled the whole chamber, and speaks slowly, but 
not without eloquence. He did not get on far, however, 
before the excitement began, and when he came to the 
guerra fratricida, Cavour jumped up as if he was stung, 
and, thumping on the green table at which the Ministers 
sit, declared that such language he could not and would 
not hear! Whereupon Garibaldi repeated the expression 
over again. The effect was tremendous ; all the deputies 
left their seats, crowding down to the centre, all talk-

ing, screaming, and gesticulating at once. The public 
tribunes, which were full of red shirts, applauded. 
The President put on his hat. Such a scene I had 
never witnessed." 

Among the writers noteworthy experiences 
at Turin was a visit to the Royal Library, where 
the public reading-room was well filled with 
readers and the atmosphere correspondingly 
rich in carbonic acid ; accordingly the obsequious 
Prefetto invited his distinguished visitors into 
the private reading-room and laid before them 
all sorts of manuscript treasures and a splendid 
copy of Dante illustrated by Dore. More than 
that, a priceless old book of designs for point 
lace, dated 1587, was placed in Madame's 
hands, and she was allowed to take it home 
with her, coupled with the assurance that the 
library books were honored by her perusal, that 
the University was too happy to be agreeable to 
her, and more in the same strain of overdone 
politeness. 

From the writer's account of her life at 
Florence, extending from 1864 to 1869, we 
quote a paragraph from a letter written in the 
eventful but anxious summer of 1866. 

■ The news of the last great Prussian victory (Sa- 
dowa) has arrived. The Legation is all imbandierata 
(beflagged), the Sindaco of Florence came to congratu- 
late officially, and . . . C. had to receive him. All our 
gentlemen were ' walking on their heads with joy ' — at 
least that was Mine. d'Usedom's description of them 
when she came in the afternoon. In the evening we 
went up to Villa Capponi, where many people had come 
to congratulate, and where all was very festive. It is 
pathetic to hear the people about us inquiring as the 
news of one Prussian victory after another comes, 
' Non c'e niente per noi ? ' (Is there nothing for us ?) 
Poor things, they have given all so freely — their 
blood, their money, and their lives. It is heartrending 
to think it should all have been of so little avail, and that 
the honourable defeat at Custozza is the only result." 

Life at The Hague was apparently less lively 
for the Bunsens than in the cities of sunny 
Italy. At one time, when all the men were gone 
to the frontier, as the author says, to guard the 
neutrality, it was especially unstimulating to 
the ladies. Relations with the French Legation 
were of course (in 1870) a little strained. " We 
do not visit," writes Madame de Bunsen, "but 
we bow and shake hands, and even speak occa- 
sionally. " The royal wedding of the following 
summer must have been an agreeable distrac- 
tion, though the absurdly long and solemn wed- 
ding sermon was a weariness. Among other 
details we read : 

" The ladies who bore the train, as generally all the 
women present, were dressed in shades of lilac, and the 



whole effect was soft and pretty. The service com- 
menced by singing, and then the clergyman of Wasse- 
naar . . . began an address from the pulpit. It is a 
very high one in Dutch fashion, with an immense 
sounding-board which seemed almost to extinguish him. 
I hardly understood a word, I am sorry to say, except 
every now and then the name of Nassau Oranien. He 
was fearfully long, moreover, more than half an hour 
by the clock over the organ opposite him, and, as we 
heard afterwards, made many sad allusions to the 
recent death of the bride's mother. He was quite in 
the wrong, for the programme said explicitly ' en korte 
trourede ' (a short nuptial address). The Princess 
Marie grew paler and paler, the King fidgeted and spoke 
to the Queen, who shrugged her shoulders. Prince 
Frederick turned to the Hof-Marschall, Count Lim- 
burg Stirum, who stood behind him, and evidently told 
him it was too long. Limburg Stirum gesticulated and 
tried to catch the preacher's eye. He signalled to the 
chambellan on the other side, and they both took out 
their watches and held them up, but all was of no avail. 
Secure in his serene attitude, his ' Welerwaarden ' went 
ever on, one high-sounding phrase succeeding another 
in a sort of cantilena, with Nassau Oranien, and Luise 
Henriette, the great Kurfurstin, as the burthen of bis 
song." 

The narrative closes with the retirement of 
the writer's husband from the diplomatic ser- 
vice, in July, 1872, and the Bunsens' withdrawal 
to their estate of Mein Geniigen in the Rhein- 
land. Madame de Bunsen has, with her pleasant 
and well-written volume, enrolled herself among 
the clever and interesting diplomats' wives who, 
from the day of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu 
down to our own time, have brightly and briskly 
pictured the scenes of diplomatic life in the gay 
capitals of the Old World. She shows, for a 
French-born person, or for an English woman 
either, an admirable command of simple and 
effective English ; in fact, most of the slips 
noticeable in her pages are, curiously enough, 
in her own French, which is introduced for a 
phrase or two now and then. For example, 
she makes the crowd cry "Vive les Francais! " 
when the French troops enter Turin — as if any 
such violation of grammar could be detected by 
the ear. Her very first page has a slight error 
of chronology, 1858 being put instead of 1857 
as the year of her arrival at Turin. The por- 
traits in the volume are many, and, being chiefly 
of celebrities whom she met, are well worthy of 
insertion. There are also various other illus- 
trations. It is, on the whole, as agreeable a 
book of the sort as has appeared since her 
sister-in-law, Madame Waddington, entertained 
us with her graphic descriptions of official life 
at the courts of St. Petersburg and London.

[March 1, 



A New Narrative of the American 

Revolutiox.* 

The fifth and sixth volumes of Mr. Avery's 
most interesting " History of the United States 
and Its People " are now before the public ; and 
although their general merit alone must have 
commended them to its attention, certain fea- 
tures call for especial emphasis. 

The volumes cover the Pre-Revolutionary and 
Revolutionary epochs, and furnish, on the whole, 
a really excellent account of the contest between 
Great Britain and her thirteen Atlantic seaboard 
colonies. They show how the basis of the con- 
test lay in the reassertion of royal prerogative, 
in the adherence to worn-out political contri- 
vances, and more than all else in the adoption of 
an imperial policy by the British government. 
In certain respects, however, they are a trifle 
disappointing ; for they lay no great stress — 
as to be up to date they should — upon the essen- 
tially civil-war nature of the struggle, or upon 
the fact that other British colonies had their 
influence upon events as well as those that were 
primarily English in origin. Moreover, they 
ignore the great subject of parliamentary 
development in England, place undue weight 
upon such controverted matters as the projected 
introduction of episcopacy into New England, 
and quite frequently lose sight of salient facts 
and principles in an unworthy attempt to bring 
places, incidents, and persons, obscure and unim- 
portant, into strong relief. This last-mentioned 
feature is all the more deplorable because, unfor- 
tunately for our national dignity, there is already 
too much of that sort of thing in America — 
too much of a tendency to exaggerate, for purely 
family reasons, the little doings of little men. 

A word or two should be said here about the 
illustrative material of Mr. Avery's work. Here- 
tofore this has been good, sometimes pointedly so. 
But in these later volumes author and publishers 
have seen fit to intersperse, among things of 
great value, things intrinsically valueless and 
foolishly expensive, — as, for instance, coats-of- 
arms, pictures of buildings now easily accessible 
to view on the souvenir post-card, and odds and 
ends of things that can be found in abundance 
in " Headquarters," in " Mansions," and in the 
museums of State historical societies. As a 
matter of principle and of respect for tradition, 
the greatest objection is to be made to the inser-

tion of coats-of-arms. We have thirteen of them 
in these two volumes. Now heraldic devices of 
all sorts belong to mediaevalism. They have no 
place in American history. They are radically 
un-American, and the ideas underlying them are 
opposed to everything that is fundamental, and 
even sacred, in the origin of this government. 
Especially do they seem out of place in a history 
of the American Revolution, in a book that, in 
grandiloquent phrase, tells the story of a supreme 
struggle for individualism. Family pride in heroic 
deed, in intellectual achievement, or in nobility 
of character, is one thing ; that in priority of emi- 
gration or of descent, in the face of uncertain and 
incomplete records, to say nothing of fraud and 
of distraint of knighthood, is quite another. 

Among the really valuable, or at least inter- 
esting, illustrations are various handbills, broad- 
sides, and portraits, plans of battles and for- 
tifications, caricatures, the French map of the 
United States in 1778, the map of the proposed 
new States in the West, maps bearing upon 
boundary disputes, and maps depicting military 
movements. All these are eminently appro- 
priate in a sober historical work, as is also the 
Plat of the Seven Ranges of Townships in the 
Ohio Survey of 1785-1787. 

There are a few places where remarks have 
been based upon, or may lead to, misconcep- 
tions. Take for example the words on page 
196 of Volume V., relative to the Massachusetts 
Judiciary Act. Remembering, as we must, that 
the Act was intended to protect from injustice 
revenue collectors and the like who might hap- 
pen to get into trouble when in discharge of 
their duties, we are puzzled to know how a 
change of venue would necessarily mean convic- 
tion. Again, on page 198, in dealing with the 
Quebec Act, the author ought to have made his 
readers understand that Great Britain, in recog- 
nizing the Roman Catholic religion among the 
French inhabitants of Canada, was acting in 
strict accordance with a treaty stipulation. The 
laudatory remarks oh pages 239 and 240 are 
decidedly misleading, inasmuch as no original 
text of Patrick Henry's speech exists, and our 
only knowledge of it rests upon what his biogra- 
pher did years afterwards when he put together 
passages that certain old men thought they re- 
membered the famous Virginian to have uttered. 
The bibliographies of the fifth and sixth vol- 
umes are full and well-selected. There are, 
however, a few regrettable omissions and a few 
unnecessary inclusions. Mrs. Gadsby's article 
on " The Harford County Declaration of Inde- 
pendence " is worthless historically, and may do

positive harm if recommended along with the 
scholarly works of Friedenwald, Van Tyne, and 
many others of high rank. To speak of a local 
intention to carry out the object of the Associa- 
tion, which was virtually non-commercial inter- 
course with Great Britain, as a declaration of 
independence, shows a lamentable ignorance of 
historical situations, and is as absurd as to speak 
of the secession of Jones County, Mississippi, 
just prior to the Civil War. Generally, how- 
ever, Mr. Avery has indicated the historical 
value of a certain book in a few well-chosen 
remarks. Sometimes he has, most conveniently 
for the investigator, grouped the various authori- 
ties on a particular subject, and sometimes he 
has both grouped and compared them. 

Among subjects that have received remark- 
ably judicious handling from Mr. Avery are the 
treatment of prisoners of war and the treatment 
of the loyalists ; also the participation of the 
negro in the Revolution. One might wish that 
some other side than the military had been em- 
phasized : but Mr. Avery chose to follow the 
beaten track, and we have yet to wait for some 
work based upon investigations into the sociolog- 
ical and economic conditions that accompanied 
or resulted from the struggle for independence. 
We are glad to have so able a discussion as Mr. 
Avery has given us of the early westward move- 
ment, of the national embarrassments under the 
Articles of Confederation, and of the perplex- 
ities that confronted the framers of the new Con- 
stitution. Altogether, he has given us a highly 
creditable piece of historical work ; and we can 
frankly say that the points for adverse criti- 
cism, quite serious though they are, are almost 
obscured by the very number and magnitude of 
those deserving commendation. We can also 
repeat that the publication as a whole promises to 
supply a long- felt want. It can be perused with 
profit by both the professional historian and the 
ordinary reader : for in suggestiveness, in general 
accuracy, and in broadness of view, its rank is un- 
questionably high. Axxie Heloise Abel. 



A Gutted Degenerate.* 



As an intimate account of a man of genius 
written by a life-long friend, M. Edmond 
Lepelletier's biography of Paul Verlaine will 
always have a certain value. But it is far from 
being the ideal biography or critical study. Its 
chatty frankness, its lack of reserve, and its

Lepelletier. Translated by E. M. Lang. Illustrated. Xew 
York : Duffield & Co. 



illumination of some of the dark corners of the 
poet's strange, sordid, tragic career, constitute 
the main claims of the book on our suffrance. 

In one way, it is a very peculiar work. 
Avowedly written by a sympathetic comrade in- 
spired by the motive of vindicating Verlaine and 
setting him in a better light than have the more 
or less apocryphal stories circulated before and 
since his death, it manages to leave a picture of 
this child of the Parisian gutter more disgusting 
than was in the imagination before. So vivid 
is this impression that at times one almost won- 
ders if the author's purpose be not, under the 
guise of friendship, to paint his subject in the 
darkest colors. Yet in reading the words of 
M. Lepelletier at Verlaine's funeral, one cannot 
but believe that this is an untenable assumption ; 
that his subject, rather, was too much for him ; 
so that, somewhat naively, he damns where he 
would fain praise. There is something terrible 
in the spectacle of a friend exposing, with good 
intentions, the essential evil behavior of one of 
the world's most gifted degenerates. 

A dipsomaniac, a lecher, a liar, a prison-bird, 
and a megalomaniac, — these be hard terms ; 
yet, to be truthful, they apply to this man who 
has written some of the most musical and most 
subtly spiritual poetry in the whole range of 
French song. The plain fact is, that Paul Ver- 
laine was untrustworthy in all the fundamental 
relations of life : to friends, to wife, to mother, 
— even to his art, since a portion of his writings 
is a foul libel upon it. That this biographer 
can eulogize him as much as he does, implies a 
questionable standard quite as much as it does 
the bias of friendship. The attempt to white- 
wash Verlaine's relation to that other poet- 
degenerate, Arthur Rimbaud, is not particularly 
convincing, although the reader will be glad 
enough to give such a man as Verlaine the 
benefit of any doubt in his favor. One is glad, 
too, freely to acknowledge that in certain parts 
of his passion-tossed existence something better 
was aroused in him and a higher nature spoke ; 
as where, in the enforced regimen of a jail, some 
of his finest religious verse was produced ; or 
when he lived quietly in rural England or France 
as a school-teacher, and made a good impression 
on those who met him, because he was removed 
from the vicious city haunts which always 
dragged him down. But there was never real 
reform, essential regeneration ; as the biogra- 
pher admits, Verlaine's conversion was always 
" literary." 

The work (which, by the way, is but indif- 
ferently Englished) has considerable interest in 



148

its pictures of the literary and art life of Paris 
during the last generation and down to the 
present : for example, the group of poets known 
as the Parnassians, of whom were both Verlaine 
and his biographer, and the Symbolists who 
followed, are described with piquant particu- 
larity. The study is also rich in pictorial ma- 
terial, including some interesting presentments 
of the satyr-poet from the age of two till he lay 
dead in a wretched garret ; as well as members 
of his family and the author of the book. 

But when all is said, one can but come back 
in sad wonderment to the poet's own words : 
" Let Lepelletier defend my reputation. He 
is able to clear what will soon be my memory. 
I rely upon him to make me known as I was in 
reality, when I am no longer here." Alas, that 
a friend could do no more ! Alas, that Verlaine 
could not have assisted him by furnishing a 
better life-story ! Richard Burton. 



The Return of the Bourbons.* 



The period of the Restoration is a somewhat 
thankless field for investigation, both absolutely 
and relatively. There is no epoch of history 
more stirring and fascinating than the Napole- 
onic era that preceded ; and it would be difficult 
to compress into sixteen years more of sordid- 
ness, triviality, and utterly unromantic blunder- 
ing, than are illustrated by the history of France 
from 1814 to 1830. It is like foul, dull realism, 
after romance ; Zola, after Victor Hugo. 

Major Hall suffers no illusions as to the char- 
acter and calibre of the men whose mistakes and 
misdeeds he is relating. His narrative is as inno- 
cent of hero as is " Vanity Fair " — unless the 
hero be Wellington, whose motives and whose 
discretion are alike above question, and who 
showed himself through the period a better friend 
to France than the majority of her own children. 
A list of official blunders during the reigns of 
Louis XVIII. and Charles X. would make a 
remarkable catalogue. Louis, on his way to 
Paris, in 1814, to occupy the throne which 
Napoleon had just abdicated, was met at Com- 
piegne by the Tsar of Russia. Filled with that 
astounding confidence in his divine mission and 
his personal importance which was part of his 
very being, Louis walked in to dinner in front 
of the dumbfounded monarch who had probably 
done more to restore him than any other other 
crowned head in Europe. Strange to say, this

manoeuvre did not make the slighted guest his 
mortal enemy, — as did a somewhat similar indis- 
cretion, the snubbing of Madame Ney by the 
Duchesse d'Angouleme, which slight is said to 
have been largely responsible for Ney's desertion 
of the Royalists when Napoleon returned. The 
Comte d'Artois had agreed to certain conditions 
in Louis's name before Louis's appearance, and 
when the new King assumed his crown he calmly 
ignored them. Similar tactics, by d'Artois him- 
self as Charles X.,a few years later, ended the 
Bourbon rule forever. Ferrand's impassioned 
defense of the emigres before the Chambres, at a 
time when the emigres " had nothing to do with 
the case," roused a feeling against them that 
predisposed the dissatisfied country in favor of 
the returning Emperor. The regulation prohib- 
iting labor on Sunday, passed in 1814, will serve 
as an example of numerous laws which were 
ostentatiously passed and then quietly ignored. 
Constant, Ney, Davout, Fouche, the leading men 
of the state, made oaths and broke them with 
what would seem most injudicious frequency. A 
mistake of $3,000,000 in the computation of the 
indemnity due the Allies would have lost France 
that amount, if the English banking-house, 
which had the matter in charge, had not gener- 
ously pointed out the error. " It would appear," 
was the disgusted comment of Metternich, the 
shrewdest statesman of the generation, " as 
though your affairs were managed by cornets of 
hussars." 

Louis XVIII. himself, though gouty and pro- 
saic, — much less of an aristocrat than the name- 
less upstart Napoleon, — was neither fool nor 
knave. He had no sympathy with the insane 
party-feeling of the emigres, and he made an 
honest effort to govern well. A modern expo- 
nent of the omnipotence of mind might find in 
his calm confidence in ultimate success an agency 
which promoted the Restoration. If he was too 
dependent on the advice of others, he could easily 
have found a less able and less honest favorite 
than Decazes among the intriguers that sur- 
rounded him. His insistence that " a King of 
France might die, but must never be ill," and 
his struggle to hold audiences and attend to his 
work while he was literally dying, is pathetic 
and heroic. One feels a genuine relief that the 
obstinate old doctrinaire did not live fa see the 
downfall of the House. 

There is less to be said for Charles X. As 
the Comte d'Artois, he had been one of his 
brother's most turbulent and troublesome sub- 
jects, and his reign is a series of arbitrary acts, 
culminating in the terrible mistake of July,

1830, — the coup d'etat that sought to reor- 
ganize an administration Chamber of Deputies, 
and which resulted in calling to the throne as a 
constitutional ruler the timid and conciliatory 
son of Philippe Egalite, Louis Duke of Orleans. 
" I know well," Metternich had said to the 
French Ambassador at Vienna, " that the free- 
dom of the press and your electoral laws are an 
abomination, but any attempt to abolish them 
by a coup d'etat will be fatal to the Bourbons." 

There are Richelieus, Talley rands, Chateau- 
briands, LaFayettes, — leaders good (a few), 
bad, and indifferent : but the most picturesque 
public character of the period, and in a manner 
the most instructive, as illustrating the possi- 
bilities of such an epoch of upheaval, is the 
scoundrel Fouche. This insatiate schemer, edu- 
cated for the Church, a Revolutionist deputy, 
regicide, devotee of the Goddess of Reason, 
actually succeeded in becoming successively 
Minister to Milan under the Directory, Minis- 
ter of Police under the Consulate, Minister of 
Interior under the Empire, Minister of Police 
under Louis XVIII. — in which last capacity 
he drew up a list of the persons who deserved 
punishment for complicity in the return of Na- 
poleon, which list he should have himself headed. 
It is but just to him to remark in this connec- 
tion, that he contrived to allow all the proscribed 
to escape from the country, and that the few ar- 
rests and executions that did occur were not in 
any sense his fault. It was not till 1816, at 
the age of sixty-two, that this prodigy of intrigue, 
who had contrived to float to the winning side 
of every considerable movement in forty years 
of turmoil, was at last definitely set aside by 
exile. 

Every movement, however vulgar and inter- 
ested, has its hero and its legend. The dead 
Emperor did more to wreck the Bourbon dy- 
nasty than that hard and vicious creature of 
ambition ever accomplished during his life. 
And set up against him to dazzle the gaze of 
the mob was the glorious First of the Bourbons, 
the gallant conqueror of Ivry, who seems to have 
resembled this portrait quite as much as his 
dissipated, selfish, and incompetent descendants 
of the early nineteenth century resembled it. 

But legends will not stir a worn-out people 
to long-continued or potent enthusiasm. There 
was little real desire for the crowning of Louis 
in 1814 ; there was little for the return of 
Napoleon ; there was little for the accession of 
the younger branch of the Bourbons in 1830. 
France was disillusionized and weary. Napo- 
leon, who was as shrewd as Metternich, re- 



marked, as he took possession of Paris in 1815, 
" They have let me come as they have let the 
other go." There were no more serious and 
general insurrections ; and when the half-hearted 

! Citizen King was half-heartedly installed in 
1830, he was allowed to reign for a time only, 
because, as Major Hall puts it on the last page 
of the present volume, " In the hour of distress 
the best elements of the nation" had "stood 
aloof and allowed the Monarchy to fall to the 

[ ground." 

A very thorough and extensive bibliography 

! accompanies the text, page by page ; and the 
book is indexed in a good deal of detail. It is 
always a matter of regret, however, when a 
painstaking and extended account of this sort, 
which is particularly valuable for reference 
purposes, has no more specific indexing than, 
for example, LaFayette, Marquis de, 43, 52, 

| 87, 101, 102, 112, etc., with no hint of the 
character of the references on each page thus 
mentioned. 

The reviewer wondered at the form emigre 
— thus, italicized, with an accent over the final 

j e only. If one accent, why not both ? If there 
is precedent for such discrimination, he has not 
found it. He has noticed, indeed, that the 
" Encyclopaedia Americana " prints " Emigres," 

; but he had supposed that the first accent was 
omitted there because of the capital initial

Nxw Apparatus for Bible Studexts.* 



Five years ago we saw the completion of two 
large four and five volume Dictionaries of the 
Bible. Now we have three new single-volume 
Dictionaries issued simultaneously, which cover 
practically the same field and are intended to 
meet the same needs. They were prepared to 
give laymen in Bible study an easy and ready 
method of getting the pith of themes which in 
the larger works are treated with a technique 
and detail designed for specialists. The writers 
of the articles in these volumes are American, 
British, and German scholars, who represent in 
the main the progressive school of thought in

biblical research. The works are constructed 
mechanically in the best modern style, and are 
both attractive and convenient. 

The editor of the Hastings " Dictionary of 
the Bible " has had large editorial experience, 
and has constructed this work skilfully from a 
literary point of view. It is by no means a con- 
densation of the five-volume Dictionary, but a 
new and independent work. The articles are 
written anew, and are up-to-date in every respect. 
The apportionment of space to the different 
themes is wisely made. The article on " Israel" 
covers twenty-four pages (by Prof. George A. 
Barton); that on "Jesus Christ" (by Prof. 
W. P. Paterson), twenty-three pages ; and one 
on the " Person of Christ " (by Prof. H. K. 
Mackintosh), twelve pages. Mr. R. A. S. 
Macalister writes many of the articles on Pales- 
tine, where he has spent several years in exca- 
vating Gezer and other places. The articles on 
Egypt and Egyptian antiquities are signed by 
Mr. F. LI. Griffith, whose work on the Nile has 
been well known for many years. Some of the 
best articles on the New Testament were written 
by Prof. W. T. Davison, of Richmond Theo- 
logical Seminary, Surrey. Prof. G. B. Gray, 
of Mansfield College, Oxford, has contributed 
a very complete article on the " Text, Versions, 
and Languages of the Old Testament "; and Dr. 
F. G. Kenyon, just now appointed as successor 
to Sir E. Maunde Thompson of the British 
Museum, supplies the article on the " Text of 
the New Testament." The book contains four 
good maps, but no other illustrations. 

The " Standard Bible Dictionary " was writ- 
ten mainly by American scholars for an Ameri- 
can public. It follows, in its classification, an 
encyclopaedic alphabet ; that is, its list of themes 
is constructed on an encyclopaedic rather than a 
dictionary plan. The articles themselves appear, 
when long enough, with numbered paragraphs 
and a brief bibliography. The editors them- 
selves have done a monumental amount of writ- 
ing for the work. Professor Jacobus's contri- 
butions are mainly on the New Testament ; Pro- 
fessor Zenos has covered, besides his especial field 
of Biblical Theology, a great diversity of themes ; 
and Professor Nourse fills in scores of small arti- 
cles on etymological, archaeological, and topo- 
graphical themes. Dr. James Denney of Glas- 
gow has an article on Christ, and Professor 
Guthe of Leipzig on Palestine. The article on 
Jerusalem is by the skilful scholar Prof. L. B. 
Paton, who recently spent a year in that ancient 
and interesting city. The Dictionary is espe- 
cially full in the department of biblical archaeol- 



ogy, emphasized by a number of beautiful half- 
tone illustrations of Palestinian implements and 
household effects now in the collections of Hart- 
ford Theological Seminary. The book contains 
many line illustrations that amply aid the reader 
in understanding the text. Of course, there are 
defects and omissions which are apparent to an 
expert, — such, for example, as the attempt to 
present in transliteration the pronunciation of 
biblical names and Hebrew words. These are 
rather superfluous, and not helpful. The scholar 
knows how to pronounce the foreign words 
(Greek and Hebrew), and the one who knows 
neither language has no use for them. A few 
good maps adorn the book. 

It may be added that these two Dictionaries 
are thought by their editors to be adapted to the 
use of laymen in Bible study, but they are grad- 
uated on rather too high a scale for that purpose. 
Excellent as they are, they are strong meat for 
mature scholars rather than lighter food for 
children in Bible study. 

"The Temple Dictionary of the Bible" 
stands in a class by itself. The names of its 
two editors are enough to call attention to the 
work. Both of them were missionaries for many 
years in the country which forms the back- 
ground of the biblical records. Rev. Mr. 
Ewing was located at that very important old 
Jewish city, Tiberias, and Dr. Thomson at 
Safed, about fifteen miles nearly north of the 
Sea of Galilee. Their first-hand knowledge of 
and familiarity with the manners and customs 
of the people, and with the topography of Bible 
lands, give them a long advantage over some of 
the editors of rival dictionaries. They are aided 
in this phase of the work by such familiar Ori- 
entalists as Dr. Dalman of Jerusalem, Mrs. 
Gibson of Cambridge, and Drs. Margoliouth 
and Sayce of Oxford, all travellers and stu- 
dents in the Orient. The critical position of 
the writers on doctrinal and biblical themes is 
distinctly conservative, as seen in such names 
as those of Drs. James Orr, James Robert- 
son, James Stalker, and D. S. Margoliouth. 
The Preface states that they " have kept stead- 
ily in view the needs of the Working Clergy- 
man, the Local Preacher, the Class Leader, 
and the Sunday-school Teacher." They have 
fulfilled their purpose in a very commendable 
manner. While there are no articles whose 
revelations are startlingly new or striking, there 
are some that are comparatively fresh on bib- 
lical antiquities, geography, and topography, 
written by persons who are experienced guides 
and know personally what they are talking

about. The articles are free from padding ; on 
the other hand, the work employs a system of 
abbreviations, which, though unquestionably 
effective in space-saving, is, to say the least, 
far from elegant. It is certainly startling to 
find a work of scholarship, like this, disfigured 
by such typographical puzzles as wd., shd., cd., 
fni., fr., nn\, br., sr., kge., bk., mt., for would, 
should, could, from, father, mother, brother, 
sister, knowledge, book, and might. A very 
attractive feature of this Dictionary is its 
admirable illustrations, many of which are half- 
tones. Among the 5-40 in the book, we dis- 
cover scores of new pictures of biblical sites 
and scenes, photographed from new and splen- 
didly chosen points of view. There are at least 
sixteen choice views of the beautiful scenery 
about the Sea of Galilee. Such glimpses give 
more of a touch of reality to any statement than 
pages of common cold narrative. Two new 
large folding views of Jerusalem and eight 
splendid maps follow the 1171 pages of the 
Dictionary proper. 

These three Dictionaries, appearing almost 
simultaneously, are significant facts in the field 
of biblical study. They furnish ready tools 
whereby the earnest thoughtful reader and stu- 
dent may delve still deeper into the realms of 
ancient ethical and religious lore.

Stories About Big Game rx Africa.* 



•• The story of the hig game of Africa has been 
many a year in the telling, but it remains ever new. 
The freshness of it is perennial. So long as the big 
game of Africa holds its own upon the velt, just so 
long will the public welcome new books that strive 
to portray its moods and its tenses." So writes 
Mr. TV. T. Hornaday. the well-known naturalist and 
author of travel-books, in his Introduction to the 
work of Mr. Edgar Beecher Bronson entitled " In 
Closed Territory." The closed territory through 
which Mr. Bronson travelled and hunted lies to the 
north and south of the policed district along the 
Uganda railway, and is open only to those who are 
in favor with the powers that be. Mr. Bronson is 
a capital story-teller, recounting not only the adven-

tures of himself and his party, but also the deeds of 
others who have risked their lives, — to put it in 
Stevenson's paradoxical way, — that they might live. 
One bit will show the manner of the narrator. It tells 
the story of the tall and wiry Lumbwa, Arab Tumo. 
slayer of sixty " rhinos " single-handed, who estab- 
lished his reputation for bravery by his part in the 
following incident. 

" While about half-way down from the summit to the 
swamp, with Arab Tumo marching ahead of me, and, although 
no more than six feet in advance, quite out of my sight, sud- 
denly I heard just beyond him the swish and crashing of some 
mighty body, and jumped forward to Arab Tumo just in 
time to see a giant rhino, which had been crossing our line 
of march directly in front, start to swing for a charge up our 
line, his great head shaking with rage, his little pig eyes 
glaring fury. 

" It was all over in a second ; for when I reached Tumo 
they were in arm's length of each other, he crouched with 
spear shortened, and, in the very second of the rhino's swing 
to charge, with one bound and mighty thrust he drove his 
great three-foot six-inch-spear-blade to entry behind the left 
shoulder, ranging diagonally through the rhino's vitals 
towards his right hip. and burying it to the very haft ! 

" Followed instantly a shrill scream of pain, a gush of 
foam-flecked blood that told of a deadly lung wound, and 
then the monster wheeled and lurched out of our sight down 
hill at right angles to our course, Tumo's spear still trans- 
fixing him. 

" So suddenly sprung and so fascinating was the scene, so 
like a single-handed duel of the old Roman arena between 
two raw savage monsters of the African jungle, biped against 
quadruped, that it never occurred to me to shoot, although 
I might have chanced a snapshot over Tumo's shoulder. 

" And there Arab Tumo stood quietly smiling, his pulse 
apparently unquickened by a single beat, signing for per- 
mission to follow and recover his spear, the blade broken 
free of its long-pointed iron butt, which was bent nearly 
double by some wrench in the ground the rhino had con- 
trived to give it to free his vitals of the gnawing blade ! 
And, once free of the spear, on he had gone — Tumo had 
not seen him again." 

Many readers of books on Africa, who have won- 
dered at the stories of the marvellous heads of game 
along the Uganda railway, will understand this re- 
markable occurrence from Mr. Bronson's explana- 
tion. 

"The extraordinary present abundance of game both 
north and south of this section of the Uganda Railway is 
due to the fact that all the vast territory extending from the 
Tsavo River to Escarpment, a distance of two hundred and 
thirty miles, and from the south line of the track to the 
German border, embracing about eleven thousand square 
miles, is a carefully preserved game reserve, preserved as 
jealously as the Yellowstone Park ; while immediately south- 
west of it in German territory is another reserve of the same 
size. Unfenced, shut in by no impassable streams or moun- 
tains, the game is free to wander out of and into the reserve 
at will ; but, like the shrewd stags of a Scotch deer forest, so 
well does the game seem to know the very boundaries that 
mark for them sanctuary, that little do they leave it except 
in periods of local drought or as crowded out by over- 
stocking, — so well do they know the immunity of sanctuary 
that, shooting from trains being forbidden, timid antelope, 
wary giraffe, and even lion and rhino, often idle within a 
stone's throw of the track.*' 

Surely Africa must be protected in some way, for, 
not taking into account our own mighty Nimrod who 
is now playing havoc there, Mr. Bronson tells us that 
in October and November, 1908, twenty hunting 
parties went out from Nairobi, and fifty more were

expected during December and January. It is to 
be regretted that our space will not allow us to give 
more excerpts from this lively book. Mr. Bronson's 
style will not appeal to the fastidious, but his robust 
vigor will suit those readers who care more for fine 
shots with the gun than with the camera, and for 
forceful description than for parlor language. 

To the list of those American sportsmen — nota- 
bly McMillan, Astor, Chanlar, John Bradley, Max 
Fleischman, Rainsf ord, and Roosevelt — who have 
had their fling at African big game, we may now 
add the name of Mr. Percy C. Madeira of Phila- 
delphia. His book entitled " Hunting in British 
East Africa " tells of the adventures of himself and 
his wife in " the most richly stocked game country 
to be found in the world to-day " — British East 
Africa. Mr. Frederick C. Selous, the premier of 
modern hunters, vouches for the book in a foreword, 
by saying that it is of " very great interest." Were 
one to judge hastily of the book by the illustrations, 
one would conclude that the author's chief aim was 
to gather fine heads and make big killings. Such, 
however, is not the case. Of hunting and fine heads 
we have a-plenty, but there is also no lack of intel- 
ligent observation on native human and plant life, 
and on general conditions now existing in that won- 
derful dark land. Moreover, if other Americans 
are desirous of adding their names to the worthy 
list of African big game hunters, they will find a 
very complete appendix to this volume giving de- 
tailed information regarding marches, temperature, 
and equipment, for a hundred days' safari, or jour- 
ney, in the land of wild beasts. Readers who wish 
to read a hair-raising tale will find unusually rare 
ones in this book. Mrs. Madeira, who was lost in 
"the rough broken country between the Tana and 
the Thika Rivers," wandered for two days without 
food or water, in a land beset by thorns and wild 
beasts. Mr. Selous characterizes the grit and pow- 
ers of endurance shown by Mrs. Madeira as " little 
short of marvellous." The illustrations in this vol- 
ume are of rather unusual merit. 

Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Patterson's book, " In 
the Grip of the Nyika," has the stamp of dignity 
both in style and matter. Unlike his previous work, 
"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo," which relates the 
Colonel's adventures with the kingly beast, his pres- 
ent volume deals with the determination of suitable 
natural boundaries for the eastern and northern 
limits of the game preserve, and with the hunting 
of elephants, antelope, and rhinoceri. In the first 
of these expeditions into the Nyika — the dark, 
enthralling wilderness of British East Africa — the 
author with two companions returned safely to civili- 
zation; but on the second and longer journey, he, 
with two companions designated as Mr. and Mrs. B., 
met with difficulties and with death. Mr. B. was 
shot while asleep by the accidental discharge of 
his own revolver which he had placed under his pil- 
low. At the time of his burial, the natives mutinied, 
and it was only through the prompt action of Colonel 



Patterson that they were quelled. Following these 
disasters came the loss of his valuable horse under 
the charge of a rogue elephant, the desertion of many 
of his followers, and the continual illness of himself 
and Mrs. B. Notwithstanding all this, the author's 
indomitable courage led him to his journey's end, 
thus establishing a name for himself as one of the 
heroes who have been in the foreguard of the British 
Empire. Colonel Patterson's book, unlike Mr. Bron- 
son's, shows us the sombre side of life on the great 
African veldt; but it is African life to the core. 

" After experience in hunting with a rifle, and 
with a camera to a lesser degree, I am frank to con- 
fess that I have found an element of excitement in 
the former totally lacking in the latter." With this 
confession, Mr. Edward T. House introduces us to 
his adventures in East Africa, New Brunswick, 
New Foundland, the Rockies, and British Columbia, 
as related in his interesting and well-illustrated vol- 
ume of detached sketches entitled "A Hunter's C amp- 
Fires." Mr. House's sketches cover a decade spent 
in the pursuit of the big game of the world, and 
relate but little about the natives who made up his 
caravans. For the reader who cares only about the 
crack of the rifle and the effect thereof, Mr. House's 
book will afford a good treat ; but for the reader who 
thinks that hunting is more than the hunter, and the 
hunted more than the bag, the book will offer small 
pleasure. We would not suggest that the author is 
that atrocious being, a game-hog, — on the contrary 
he is quite sportsmanlike in his following ; but he 
has not the saving grace which leads us to the up- 
lands of foreign lands where we may get the vision 
of nature's abundant wild life. The author will 
doubtless be satisfied with the commentary that this 
is a book for the man with a gu*n.

A new survey » 

of 19th century teenth Century (Putnam), Mr. 
literature. Laurie Magnus has given us an inter- 

esting and valuable discussion of the characteristics 
and tendencies of that period. He has especially 
tried to make his book — a volume of 427 pages — 
" not so much a history of English literature between 
1784 and the present day as a survey of that litera- 
ture as a whole and an essay in its criticism." For 
this reason the book contains little biographical mat- 
ter. The criticism is of an eminently satisfactory 
kind. Mr. Magnus is not concerned merely with 
re-estimating the individual writers, though this task 
occupies, naturally, most of his time; he is deeply 
interested in the literary movements of the century ; 
in the peculiar significance of the typical and the col- 
lective utterances of the successive periods. Book I. 
surveys the period from the death of Johnson to that 
of Scott, — the period which saw the principles of 
the French Revolution extended in all directions, the

rapid growth of the novel, the enunciation of new 
principles of poetry, and the rise of the periodical 
press. Toward the end of this period there is a lull, 
a pause. Byron (on whom Mr. Magnus is less 
severe than are many others), Shelley, and Keats 
had passed off the stage. Wordsworth's poetry had 
heen practically all written before this time. Car- 
lyle, that John Baptist of the new time, had not yet 
found a publisher for his gospel of " Sartor " in book 
form. The year 1832, thinks Magnus, looks back 
on the great period of Romance and forward to the 
great period of Democracy. The Reform Bill marks 
the decisive acquisition of immense social and moral 
gains. A new view of nature, physical and spiritual, 
was to possess men. Mr. Magnus instructively con- 
trasts the thought of the "Essay on Man " (1733) 
with the view of things that prevailed from the times 
when the revolutionary principles became completely 
established. The second half of the book discusses 
the remainder of the century. The three-score and 
eight years between Scott's death and that of Ruskin 
beheld enormous progress in science, the rise of 
almost radically new views in theology, the flower- 
ing of the novel, and the flourishing of three great 
poets, Tennyson, Browning, and Swinburne, around 
whom may be clustered a multitude of lesser lights. 
Tennysonians will be pleased with the treatment 
accorded their poet on the score of form, but will not 
relish so much the belittling estimate of him as a 
thinker. Tennyson's growing conservatism and con- 
stant timidity do not please Mr. Magnus. " Do noth- 
ing, dare nothing, assert nothing — tradition, cus- 
tom, doubt — are at the root of his practical counsel, 
and 'the larger hope,' and the 'divine event' are 
subordinate to these negations." Magnus admires 
the energy and solidity of Browning's thought as well 
as his sturdy faith. To Dickens and Meredith the 
critic is quite just. On Swinburne he wisely refrains 
from attempting a final judgment, though he is a 
frank admirer of the last Victorian. Occasionally 
the author's style is enigmatical, — for example, at 
the end of the description of Carlyle's contemporaries 
(p. 179); but in general he is illuminating and lucid. 
Crawford must be claimed as an American (p. 278); 
and William James is a resident of Cambridge, 
Massachusetts (p. 222). Perhaps there is too fre- 
quent use of the dash-parenthesis; and a dash fol- 
lowed by a comma or semicolon does not look well. 
The index is scarcely full enough. On the whole 
we find the volume commendable, a distinctly wel- 
come contribution to the criticism of an era which 
will receive more attention in the next quarter cen- 
tury, as its true proportions become more evident 
and perspective enables us to see more clearly what 
it achieved. 

An advocate of woman's rights is not 
o/jfoUand" wont to turn to seventeenth-century 

Holland for a champion, and indeed 
no suffragette is the " Learned Maid " who looks 
out from her forgotten niche in history through the 
pleasant pages of Una Birch's "Anna van Schurman, 



Artist, Scholar, Saint " (Longmans ) . Yet the " Tenth 
Muse," the " Sappho of Holland," as she was styled 
by her contemporaries, qualified for controversy 
when she queried, " Does the pursuit of learning and 
letters become a girl of to-day ? " and proceeded to 
apply to her sex Plato's dictum, " It becomes a per- 
fect man to know what is to be known and to do what 
is to be done." Etched against the background of 
the Dutch Renaissance, with its " amazing efflores- 
cence of national life," the "Star of Utrecht" shines 
with a light diffused through varied mediums. Marie 
de Medici, hearing her sing, declared how " pleasant 
a surprise it was to find Italy in Holland." After 
betraying her versatility in the current forms of art, 
she plunged as ardently into learning, mastering 
many languages and achieving the unique distinction 
of the authorship of an Ethiopian grammar. An 
object of pilgrimage for the notables of Europe, the 
friend of Descartes, Vo6t, Richelieu, Queen Christina 
of Sweden, and other famous folk, the gentle lady's 
gentle adventures make picturesque reading. Not the 
least entertaining passages are the panegyrics of ad- 
mirers, which, despite her decorous modesty, seem 
to have " delighted Anna, who, together with the 
solid virtues of perseverance, concentration, and 
courage, was possessed of an amusing vanity which 
redeems her from all charge of inhumanity or dull- 
ness." A chronic habit of depicting herself and of 
being depicted has scattered her portrait throughout 
Europe, several being reproduced in the book. In 
the latter part of her life the pursuit of holiness 
absorbed her as completely as had her previous enter- 
prises, and her diverse friendships gave way to one 
commanding intercourse. Resolving to spend her 
days " in the studio in which souls are as canvas to 
be painted on by the great master," she joined the 
community founded by the mystical preacher, Jean 
de Labadie. It is a matter for regret that here exig- 
ences of material or deficiencies in popular know- 
ledge have compelled the author to shift the limelight 
from her leading lady to the tenets of Calvinistic 
theology and the fortunes of the Labadist community 
with which Anna cast in her lot. Yet it is hard to 
quarrel with a book which so well fulfils its own 
aim : simply to set down the story of a " fearless, 
famed, and retired life." 



Slavery and 
secession in 
Virginia. 



A Richmond lawyer, Mr. Beverly 
B. Munford, in his book on "Vir- 
ginia's Attitude toward Slavery and 
Secession " (Longmans) has done some really origi- 
nal work upon a rather hackneyed topic. Based 
upon a careful study of historical sources — manu- 
scripts, public records, and newspapers, as well as 
the published works relating to the subject — the 
book is of value to the historian of slavery, politics, 
and the Civil War. The purpose of the author is 
to make clear the attitude of the dominant element 
of the Virginian people toward the Union, the 
problems of slavery, emancipation, and secession. 
By extensive quotations from public documents,

speeches, and letters, he shows that the Virginians, 
were not hostile, hut were devoted to the Union and 
to the principles of the founders of the Repuhlic ; 
that they were not devoted to the institution of 
slavery and desirous of seeing it extended, but that 
they were much dissatisfied with it and made serious 
efforts to get rid of it. The reactionary effect of 
the methods of the radical abolitionists upon anti- 
slavery sentiment in Virginia is explained in detail, 
and the rise of pro-slavery sentiment is traced to 
the secession. Of the general conditions of slavery 
the author writes but little, though he gives a good 
treatment of the colonization movement and a dis- 
cussion of the difficulties in the way of emancipation. 
The economic aspects of the " peculiar institution " 
are neglected. As to secession, Mr. Munford proves 
that Virginia was strongly opposed to such a step, 
and that only after she had vainly tried to reconcile 
the sections was she forced by the Federal policy 
of coercion to range herself with the cotton States 
that had already seceded. Of the characteristics 
of the Virginians who thus stood between the two 
extremes and were forced to choose one or the 
other, the author says : "Asa people they exalted 
honor and courage — they exhibited the strength 
of the idealist combined on the part of many with 
the limitations of the doctrinaire ; they decided 
questions by the standard of abstract right, rather 
than in their relation to the duties and interests of 
other peoples and other times ; they were self-reliant, 
content to justify the integrity of their conduct to 
their own consciences rather than to the world ; 
they were tenacious of their rights, and regarded a 
threatened invasion as not only justifying but com- 
pelling resistance." Secession came to these people 
as an event *• long dreaded and much to be deplored. 
They met it with a firm adherence to the principles 
so often declared, but with profound regret that the 
occasion had arisen which rendered their assertion 
imperative. In the conflict thus joined, the people 
of Virginia took a stand predetermined by the be- 
liefs and avowals of successive generations, and, 
impelled by an unswerving idealism, found their 
supreme incentive to action in their determination 
to maintain the integrity of principle." 

Autobiopraphv In a clearly-written narrative of 
of a Chinese- moderate length, Mr. Yung Wing, 
American. sometime Associate Chinese Minister 

at Washington, and Commissioner of the Chinese 
Educational Commission, relates the main events of 
his active and useful life. " My Life in China and 
America" (Holt) is the book's title, and a prepos- 
sessing portrait of the author serves as frontispiece. 
Born of poor parents in the village of Nam Ping, 
near Macao, the boy Yung had the good fortune to 
receive the rudiments of an English education in a 
mission school, which gave him a desire to go still 
further in occidental learning. How his desire was 
gratified, chiefly through his own pluck and perse- 
verance, how he entered the Monson Academy, was 
graduated, and then proceeded to Yale, where he 



remained four years, took high honors in English, 
and was the first Chinese student to receive a degree, 
— all this is unassumingly told in the opening chapters ; 
after which comes the account of his self-imposed 
labors for his country, his adventures in the Taiping 
rebellion, his work for the American education of 
Chinese boys, his appointment as joint minister with 
Chin Lan Pin at Washington, and his diplomatic 
activities in connection with the Japanese war of 
1894-5. His opinion as to the cause of the Taiping 
rebellion is noteworthy. u Neither Christianity nor 
religious persecution," he maintains, " was the im- 
mediate and logical cause of the rebellion of 1850. 
They might be taken as incidents or occasions that 
brought it about, but they were not the real causes 
of its existence. These may be found deeply seated 
in the vitals of the political constitution of the gov- 
ernment. Foremost among them was the corruption 
of the administrative government." In other words, 
it was " graft " that caused all the mischief. The 
author has excellent command of his adopted lan- 
guage, having in fact at one time all but forgotten 
his native tongue ; and for both style and substance 
his book commends itself. 

„ Charon, seated on one of the twin 

Nearness ' , 

to the ideal peaks of Parnassus, surveying all the 

Greek spirit. Greek world, had no wider range of 
vision than Professor Francis G. and Mrs. Anne 
C. E. Allinson, in their book on " Greek Lands and 
Letters " (Houghton). While the task that they 
assume of interpreting " Greek lands by the litera- 
ture, and Greek literature by local associations and 
physical environment," in one volume, may appear 
Herculean, yet because of their simple modus 
operandi they have succeeded admirably in produc- 
ing a scholarly, and yet withal pleasing, book of 
travel. They treat all of the fourteen odd divisions 
of Greece in the same manner, — first, its physical 
characteristics ; then the mythological and historical 
accounts, to complete the stage setting; and finally 
the literature produced by and about each particular 
locality for interpreting Greek life and institutions. 
Thus Attica, open to all the world by reason of its 
geographical situation, becam e the world's intellectual 
and literary clearing-house in religion, politics, and 
the fine arts. Sparta, on the other hand, hemmed 
in on three sides by mountains, was " extraordi- 
narily bare of artistic adornment." After a careful 
examination of the twenty chapters dealing with 
these sympathetic phases of physiography and lit- 
erature, the reader feels that he has obtained, in a 
most learned and entertaining way, an outline of the 
different factors in Greek civilization, and has 
brought most vividly to his mind an inkling of 
"what is most vital in our Hellenic heritage." 
Travellers who digest the contents of this volume 
will feel that they are in close touch with the ideal 
Greek spirit, and that they have progressed from 
thyrsus-bearers to mystics. The four maps and 
numerous photographic illustrations, together with the 
colored frontispiece, are instructive and interesting.

Ardent lovers of Dickens can never 
tf%c7eZ7ana. h ^ve enough of him; and so they 

will welcome Mr. W. Teignmouth 
Shore's attractive octavo, " Charles Dickens and His 
Friends " (Cassell), in which has been assembled a 
considerable selection of passages about Dickens by 
his contemporaries, and about them by him and by 
one another. Forster is, of course, the chief authority 
consulted, while Thackeray, Rogers, Carlyle, Jeffrey, 
Landor, Milnes, and our own Longfellow and James 
T. Fields, are among the host of others drawn upon 
for material. The author occasionally speaks in 
his own person, and at other times quotes without 
citing his authority. Five portraits of Dickens, with 
other illustrations, adorn the volume, and it is an 
interesting study to note the wide difference between 
the young Apollo of Maclise's painting and the some- 
what severe and careworn middle-aged man from 
Frith's brush. The " door-knocker " beard of the 
latter portrait was abhorred by Forster, but Dickens 
himself gloried in it and was " told by some of his 
friends that they highly approved of the change 
because they now saw less of him." Mr. Shore has 
produced an agreeable scrap-book which evidences 
diligence, ingenuity, and not too slavish regard for 
method. No index is provided, and no list of 
authorities, nor is the reader's attention distracted 
by footnotes. Of preface, too, the book is innocent, 
and of appendix it pleads not guilty. It is just an 
unpretentious compilation of entertaining Dickens- 
iana, a book to read in at odd moments and not 
to take too seriously. 



A college 
president 1 s 
pilgrimage. 



The reader of Miss Caroline Hazard's 
volume, "A Brief Pilgrimage in the 
Holy Land " (Houghton) will wish 
that he might have heard the addresses that form 
the book, as they were originally given in the college 
chapel at Wellesley on Sunday evenings. With 
appropriate music for each address — Mendelssohn's 
Elijah for u Carmel by the Sea," the Pastoral Sym- 
phony for "The Plain of Sharon," Christmas music 
for " Bethlehem "; with graceful and rare-spirited 
sonnets read for a prelude ; and with fitting quota- 
tions from the Scriptures for each address, there 
must have been an atmosphere of sanctity and a dim 
religious light which the printed book cannot give. 
Nevertheless, the fervor of the author gives us the 
light and the peace of one who, like her ancestors in 
the Crusades, went down from Carmel to the Sea of 
Galilee, and thence to the blessed feast at Jerusalem. 
There is a sufficient amount of historical background 
to make the book instructive as well as uplifting : 
the sights and incidents of the holy Past give the 
author occasion, which she wisely improves, for deal- 
ing with the no less holy Present. No doubt, as Pres- 
ident Hazard says, " Wellesley ought to be a better 
college because its President has been on pilgrimage "; 
and equally, no doubt, every hearer of the addresses 
and every reader of the book will be somehow better 
for hearing and reading the story. 



Notes. 



The H. W. Wilson Co., Minneapolis, publish a vol- 
ume of " University Addresses " by Professor William 
Watts Folwell. The addresses are four in number, 
and are dated from 1869 to 1884. 

Privately printed by Mr. Luther A. Brewer at Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa, we have a limited edition of Stedman's 
little book upon Edgar Allan Poe. The original of this 
work is now hard to obtain, which makes this beautiful 
new edition all the more welcome. 

" Selections from the Economic History of the United 
States, 1765-1860," by Professor Guy Stevens Collen- 
der, is a publication of Messrs. Ginn & Co. It is in 
form a source-book, with extensive introductory essays 
supplied for the several chapters. There are fifteen 
main divisions, such as " Colonial P^conomy," " Trans- 
portation," " Settlement of the West," and " Economics 
of Slavery." The book is a large one, numbering over 
eight hundred pages. 

" The People's Library," a series of handy and inex- 
pensive volumes, which have had a large sale in En- 
gland, will be put upon the American market by Messrs. 
Cassell & Co. Among the latest additions to the " Li- 
brary " are to be noted Stevenson's " Master of Bal- 
lantrae," Hawthorne's " House of the Seven Gables," 
Jane Austen's " Emma," Charlotte Bronte's " Villette," 
Borrow's " Lavengro," Irving's " Sketch Book," Rus- 
kin's " Crown of Wild Olives " and " Seven Lamps of 
Architecture," Pope's translation of the " Iliad," De- 
foe's "Journal of the Plague Year," Holmes's "Pro- 
fessor at the Breakfast Table," and Thomas a Rempis's 
" Imitation of Christ." 

A unique and delightful publishing enterprise is that 
known — but not so widely as its merits deserve — as 
" John Martin's Letters for Children." One has only 
to send to the publisher (Morgan Shepard of New 
York), stating the age of the boy or girl to be written 
to, and once in every two weeks a letter is forthcoming. 
" John Martin " writes about animals and fairies and 
children and other things that children love. He puts 
in a rhyme or two towards the end, and a talk about 
books for boys and girls. He draws pictures to illus- 
trate his stories, and his writing is plain, so that little 
folks can read it. There is a space for the name of 
each small recipient at the beginning of the letters; 
and this, with their friendly intimate style, would make 
it very difficult to prove to any of " John Martin's " 
many correspondents that the " Letters " are only a 
sort of bi-monthly magazine pleasantly disguised. 

Mr. H. E. Marshall, who, several years ago, published 
a history of England for young readers, now gives us a 
companion volume in " The Child's English Literature " 
(Stokes). It is a difficult task to interest youth in the 
history of literature, but our author has achieved some 
measure of success by his avoidance of text-book 
methods, his adoption of a simple and unaffected style, 
and his choice of such material as can be brought into 
some sort of real relationship with childish interests. 
His scale of proportion is quite different, as is proper, 
from that which would be imperative in a book for older 
people. His book has, moreover, the advantage of a 
series of beautiful and instructive illustrations in color, 
to say nothing of its attractive typography and boldly- 
decorated covers. For the right kind of boy or girl 
from twelve to sixteen, we could not imagine a more 
welcome gift or delightful possession.

' * The portrait [Abraham Lincoln] is an admirable one, and the etch- 
ing is as striking and strong as those which have preceded it. The 
nigged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the 
deep lines of care that furrow the brow are significant of the period of 
storm and stress." — A«r York Herald. 

" Thk Wbtt* House, Washington, Febr. 2, 1909. 
"Mr. JACQUES REICH, 1 Madison Ave., N. T. 

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham 
Lincoln, when I took it to be framed for the President, and it is the best 
likeness of him. ... I am the only living body guard of Abraham 
Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to Tie today, as when he was living. I would love so much to 
have one of those etchings if you will kindly tell me how I can get one. 
Very truly yours, WM. H. CROOK."

PROMENADES OF AN IMPRESSIONIST 



By JAMES HUNEKER 



A volume that illustrates anew the remarkable delicacy of style that enables Mr. Huneker to express ideas of great 
subtlety. 

" The Promenades of an Impressionist "' is as authoritative an exposition and comment as its immediate predecessor. 

*' Ego:- 

The field of the writer's " Promenades " is for the most part a modern field. Mainly he flashes upon the screen such 
figures as Cezanne. Rops. Montieelli. Rodin, Carriere. Degas, and Sorolla. If he turns back as far as Greco, Velasquez, 
and even Botticelli, it is because they are. in a sense, modern discoveries. His pages are alive with color and anecdote.

From the deck of an ocean-going yacht — tied up in New York harbor — the 
guests are idly watching the professional skill with which a young man is handling 
a cable on a near-by tug. One of the men carelessly throws him a cigarette, and 
Virginia Howland, noting the quick resentment with which this tactless perfor- 
mance is received, leans over the rail and offers an apology. That the end of 
the incident, and that same day her father's yacht sails for the Carribean. But 
no experienced reader of fiction needs to be told that a romance begins then and 
there. Nor is there any need of going further into the plot; it is a firstrate sea 
story, swift, exciting, and skillfully done, with some splendidly stirring climaxes.

for the present day, for it was the fruit of the psychotherapeutic movement which parallels the one that is 
receiving so much attention in our time. Dr. Worcester of the Emmanuel Movement says of this book : " It contains 
the principles of our whole project, and expresses many phases of our thought better than we are able to express 
it." (March.)

browed, spectacled gentleman living at Highbury, wearing a gold pince-nez. and writing for the most part in the 
beautiful library of the Reform Club. This gentleman didn't know Mr. Polly personally, but he had dealt with him

PhUoSOphy aS a Science By Dr. Paul Cams 

AN epitome of the philosophy with which Dr. Carus has identified his life work. It 
contains an introduction written by himself, summaries of his books (45), and 
editorial articles (959) published in The Monist and The Open Court; and a subject index

224 pp. Cloth, SO cents; paper, 25 cents. 



PRESS NOTES 



Dr. HEINRICH HOLTZMANN, Baden. Germany. 

" I find in your book, Philosophy as a Science, a splendid 
summary of a world -conception attained through an honest 
struggle with all kinds of tradition and erroneous beliefs. The 
thoroughness with which you have explored world-old wisdom 
and learning, is shown in the brilliant and varied contents 
of this summary of your writings, which, if brought together, 
would make a whole library. I hope that you may be spared 
for many years to continue this great work, but, if you should be 
called hence to-day, you can say with rare satisfaction, vizi. 

" With heartiest thanks and best wishes for the continuance 
of your labor, I am, Cordially yours, 

HEINRICH HOLTZMANN." . 

EDWARD W. CLODD, London, author of Story of Creation. 
" I very greatly appreciate your Synopsis. Many of your 
books are with me; they are ever separately stimulating; so, 
quite welcome is this abstract of the sum total of what your 
vigorous and fertile pen has done." 

Professor E. B. McQILVARY, University of Wisconsin. 

" Your short epitome seems to me a masterpiece of clearness 
and directness. If all philosophers could only succeed in mak- 
ing themselves understood as you do, there would be much less 
discussion among us." 

Professor EDWARD F. BUCHNER, Johns Hopkins University. 
" We all have been many a time indebted to you for special 
services in the history of philosophy and in breaking new 
ground for present and future construction work. And now 
comes this Weyweiser which enables us to appreciate to the full 
your industry and your leadership, and at the same time to sum 
up our total indebtedness to the stimulating work you have 
achieved." 

THE DIAL, Chicago, says: 

" All of these writings are carefully indexed, which makes it 
possible to find out readily just what Dr. Carus thinks about any 
given subject, and his ideas are apt to be both well-considered 
and weighty. The introductory essay is to be particularly 
commended." 

Professor EDWARD S. AMES. University of Chicago. 

" Your Philosophy as a Science is an impressive bibliog- 
raphy and one which facilitates the use of your numerous and 
important contributions to philosophy." 

Dr. EDWARD A. PACE, Catholic University of America, 
Washington, D. C 
" Your Philosophy as a Science opens up lines of thought in 
many directions and serves as an excellent guide in the broad 
field which your writings have covered. In both respects it 
should be welcome to students of philosophy." 

Professor A. ROSS HILL, University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo. 
" It is an excellent idea to bring together in one volume 
summaries of your numerous writings, and I shall take pleasure 
in reading the volume, not only for the sake of the summaries of 
works I have not read, but also in order to renew my acquaint- 
ance with those that I am more or less familiar with." 

Professor W. S. BRYAN. President of Indiana University, 
Bloomington. Ind. 
" I recognize the important service which you have rendered 
by your conduct of The Monist and The Open Court." 



FRANK C. DOAN, A.M..Ph.D.,MeadvilleTheologicalSphool,Pa. 
" Your Philosophy as a Science is the record of a stupend- 
ously busy life. It will be convenient as a key to your philosophy. 
I especially value the ' Introduction.' " 

HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL, American Philosophical 
Society, New York. 
" Few philosophers have shown such devotion to the cause 
of enlightenment, and I congratulate you heartily." 

ISAAC HUSIK, University of Pennsylvania. 

"Your Philosophy as a Science will be most useful to the 
student and investigator as a bibliography and a point of 
view. You certainly have the distinction of having covered a 
greater field in your investigations than any other philosopher 
I know." 

HENRY T. FOWLER, Ph.D., Dept. of Biblical Literature, 
Brown University. 
' ' I have read with interest and profit the epitome of the writ- 
ings of Dr. Paul Carus." 

BOOK REVIEW DIGEST. 

' ' The philosophy of Dr. Paul Carus is given in a nut shell. It 
contains an introduction that touches upon vital philosophical 
requirements of the age." 

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, Chicago. 

" A really remarkable little book. In twenty-eight pages Dr. 
Carus briefly states his own philosophical conclusions, giving 
this succinct statement with great clearness, then follows over 
150 pages, giving the philosophical books and articles he has 
written, with a brief summary of each. Not only a survey of 
astounding industry and learning but a guide to and synopsis 
of all this work." 

Professor WALLACE N. STEARNS, Ph.D., Grand Forks.N. Dak. 
" I have long appreciated the value of Dr. Carus's work, and 
now especially this excellent summary of his writings." 

Professor CHARLES C. TORREY. Ph.D., New Haven. Conn. 

" I have always been interested in your writings, and espe- 
cially in your philosophy ... I am sure that this little book 
with its summary statement and its multiform references will 
be useful to a good many scholars." 

Professor C. H. TOY, LL.D., Harvard University, Cambridge; 
.Mass. 

"I am glad to have this synopsis of your writings, the titles 
of which are full of suggestion and their contents are of special 
interest to me. . . . 

"With congratulations on your long and faithful career of 
work." 

Professor MILTON G. EVANS, D.D., Crozer Theological Sem- 
inary, Chester, Pa. 
"A valuable acquisition to our library, in that it furnishes 
an index to your publications." 

Professor C. W. VOTAW, Ph.D., Chicago University. 

" You have contributed largely, finely, and efficiently toward 
the advancement of ethical, religious, philosophical, and 
scientific thought. I hope this summary of your publications 
may extend the reading and influence of them."

This little book is multum in parvo. Of course, I have known

" Allow me to express an appreciation for your large contri- 
bution to right and clear thinking. You have impressed and

I congratulate you upon having done so much so well for the 
"'science of the sciences." I am glad to have the reference list

... I trust that you may be permitted to enjoy many more years 
of labor equally fruitful." 

President GEORGE A. COE. D. D.. of Union Theological Semin-

much struck by the range of your activities. I shall use this 
index in working up various subjects in which I am myself

has done much for free religious thought."

your teachings open up vistas of truth. I do not see why your 
fundamental ideas are necessarily inconsistent with the reten- 
tion of the substance of what we call broad church doctrine." 



THE ADVANCE. Chicago. 

" That Dr. Carus is in earnest there can be no doubt ; his aim 
ever is to ' build up a sound and tenable philosophy, one that 
would be as' objective as any branch of the natural sciences.' 
While this author's writings are prolific, and the subjects dealt 
with varied, yet he has ever aimed to form with the mosaic, a 
completed whole." 

Professor HENRY CREW, Northwestern University. College 
of Liberal Arts. Evanston. 111. 
" I have been very much interested in your introduction and 
wish to congratulate you upon your marvellous productivity. 
The metaphysics in physics is a subject which interests me 
exceedingly." 

Professor WILLIAM CALDWELL, McGill University.

this complete account of your many writings will prove most 
useful."

" I am sure I shall profit by reading Philosophy at a 
Science, by Dr. Carus." 

Professor GEO. L. RAYMOND. George Washington University. 
Washington, D. C. 
" This vast amount of work that one man has been able to 
put through, is in itself a source of great encouragement and 
inspiration. When in addition to this comes the consideration, 
which cannot fail to be recognized, that this work has been 
done in the most difficult of all departments of intellectual 
effort, and done in such a way and without exception, so far as 
one's experience can recall to command attention and to 
awaken suggestion, then there is a result that almost justifies 
the homage that one feels that he should give to the highest 
source of inspiration." 

President FRANCIS BROWN. D.D.. Union Theological Sem- 
inary, New York. 
" A stately and worthy showing of contributions to serious 
thought. We cannot all agree as to precise opinions, but we 
can all recognize honest work when we see it." 

Dr. JOSEPH CLEMENTS, author of The Xature and Habitat 
of the Soul. 
" I have read many of Dr. Carus's works always with profound 
interest, though at times in disagreement. This one is both 
charming and useful. I have for many years appreciated the 
splendid work of THE OPEN COURT institution, so nobly done 
and doing, and sincerely hope for its continued success and 
advance." 

RECORD-HERALD, Chicago. 

" For the versatility of his interests and the prolificness of 
his writings, taken in connection with the systematic precision 
of his thought. Dr. Paul Carus has few equals. He has published, 
under the title. Philosophy at a Science, a very lucid little 
sketch of his philosophic attitude, and has appended to it a 
list of his books, numbering about fifty titles, and a list of his 
articles from The Slonist and The Open Court, covering a hun- 
dred pages. His books group themselves under subjects such as 
philosophy, ethics, the history of religion, German literature. 
Buddhism, and Chinese subjects. 

" Dr. Carus's monism is not the mechanical monism which 
men under the influence of the physical sciences often insist on. 
but a monism which gives full play to the life of the spirit, and 
which is as hospitable to art and religion as to the immediate 
practical activities of men." 

Rev. WILLIS J. BEECHER. D.D.. Auburn, N. Y. 

" An attractive and adequate account of the work of Dr. 
Carus. Quite apart from its bibliographical value, the book is 
so constructed that it is worth reading in its own right."

CAVANAGH : FOREST RANGER 

A New Novel by HAMLIN GARLAND 

With an Introduction by Gifford Pinchot 
Swift action, exalted patriotism, heights of emotion — all make this new romance remarkable — a transcript of life on 
the Forest Range. The heroine is Virginia Wetherford, who returns from Philadelphia, where she had been attending 
school, to find the West of her childhood changed as she enters the home of her mother, Lize Wetherford, proprietor of 
a malodrous eating-house. Ross Cavanagh, the forest ranger, comes down to procure provisions and to get his mail. 
The young people are at once profoundly interested in each other. As the story proceeds, Cavanagh is driven to 
defending his reservation against the encroachments of those who regard the national forest as a legitimate poaching- 
place. Cavanagh represents, indeed, the far-off Federal authority, and displays a soldier's loyalty. Here the real story

MARY CARY By kate langley bosher 

Rare as a new comet is a book of the heart. Here is such a book — simple, whimsical, quaint, impulsive, true — this 
wonderful Mary Cary. Mrs. Bosher never wrote a book before. " I felt I had to write this story because I knew this 
wistful, mirthful, little orphan. Mary Cary never walks when she can skip or dance. She is like a sprite that touched 
with a light kiss all the loved things, and at the unloved would not give even a look. I have seen her quiver in the 
abandonment of joy, but I have also seen her in a passion of anger, with eyes blazing through a flood of tears."

The Biography of a Boy New York Society on Parade 



For Grown-ups 
By JOSEPHINE DASKAM BACON 
Here is Binks again. He was loved and admired from 
Maine to California in " The Memoirs of a Baby." He's a 
little bit older and funnier — very much funnier — in this 
new story. It is something more than a novel or a book 
of fun — although it is like both of them. 

With SO Illustrations by Rose O'Neill. 
Post 8vo. Cloth, $1.50. 



By RALPH PULITZER 

Mr. Pulitzer writes of New York Society from an entirely 
new viewpoint. From the inside he relates in an informal, 
good-naturedly satirical vein, the follies, the absurdities, 
the contradictions, of extremely fashionable life in New 
York. This story is told in three phases — the Dinner, the 
Opera, the Dance. It is sparklingly witty and amusing.

his temperament and tastes qualified him to enjoy to the 
full — and his recital makes as thrilling a narrative as one

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



In spite of North Pole, South Pole, et al, we believe this to be 
the most entertaining travel book of this decade. 



"A Vagabond 

Journey Around 

the World" 

is a book which will in- 
terest any one, young or 
old, who cares for adven- 
ture. It is the story o£ 
a young university man 
who made a journey around 
the world, and accomplished it

ing what little he earned by the 
way. The author was possessed of ^^^^ 
keen powers of observation, and, above 
all, the Yankee trait of being at home 
wherever he finds himself. 




The Most Vivid Picture of 

Native Life in Strange 

Corners of the World 

Ever Presented 

is in this book. French 
tramps, underground den- 
izens of German cities, 
Arabs of the Desert, high- 
and low -cast people of 
India, — these, and count- 



less others, are shown us as real 

personalities who stand out with 

the vividness of Kipling characters.

THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY 

By WILL IRWIN. 12 mo, 240 pages. Price 
$1.15 net, postage 10 cents. 

Will Irwin is one of the best-known contributors to cur- 
rent magazines. Here is his first important novel, — an 
up-to-date mystery story, now in book form after its 
serial appearance in The Saturday Evening Post. The in- 
terest is sustained until, at the end, the mystery is solved. 

MR. CARTERET 

By DAVID GRAY, author of "Gallops." 
16 mo, 218 pages, handsomely illustrated. 
Price $1.00 net, postage 7 cents. 

Some of the best horse and hunting stories that have ever 
appeared are in Mr. Gray's two books of " Gallops." The 
new volume, "Mr. Carteret," contains Mr. Gray's most 
recent stories, all of them touching on sport. There is 
one capital golf story included in the collection. 

OLD LADY NUMBER 31 

By LOUISE FORSSLUND. 16mo, 275 pages. 
Price $1.00. 

A book which is having a constantly increasing sale, and 
one in which pathos and humor are equally blended. Old 
Lady No. 31 is not an old lady at all, but an old man 
who, with his wife, enters an old ladies' home and soon 
becomes " cock of the walk."

A Mennonite Maid." 12mo, 311 pages. Price

This is the most dramatic, and the most absorbing novel 
Mrs. Martin has written since her famous " Tillie : A 
Mennonite Maid." It is a story of the Pennsylvania 
Dutch, among whom comes a cultured Southern girl. It 
is a strong novel that grips from first page to last. 

THE PRODIGAL FATHER 

By J. STORER CLOUSTON, author of "The 
Lunatic at Large." 12mo, 300 pages. Price 
$1.50. 

A delightful, amusing story, something after the order of

example in the business world, begins to grow young 
again with startling rapidity.

and talented American — for the 
"most beautiful woman in Lon-

THE KEATS-SHELLEY MEMORIAL. 



It is now almost a year since the ceremonial 
opening of the Keats-Shelley Memorial House 
in Rome — the house in the Piazza di Spagna 
to which Keats was brought by Joseph Severn, 
and in which the poet died February 23, 1821. 
The first Bulletin of the Memorial Association 
has just been issued, under the editorship of 
Sir Rennell Rodd and Mr. H. Nelson Gay, and 
for the first time makes public the full details 
of the exercises, besides presenting much other 
matter of deep interest to the lovers of the two 
English poets whose dying gaze was fixed upon 
Italian skies. Henceforth poetry-loving pil- 
grims from the English-speaking world to the 
Eternal City will pay double tribute to the 
memory of Keats and Shelley, — first at the 
twin tombs in the shadow of the Pyramid of 
Cestius, and then at the house which is now 
dedicated to these two immortal singers. 

The inception aud progress of the enterprise 
so happily conceived and successfully carried 
into effect may be briefly recapitulated. It was 
in 1903, on the anniversary of Keats's death, 
that the plan took definite shape at the meeting 
of a small group of American authors who were 
then fortuitously gathered in Rome. The ini- 
tiative was due to Mr. Robert Underwood 
Johnson, and his efforts were cordially seconded 
by Sir Rennell Rodd. It was determined to 
organize English and American and Roman 
committees, to obtain the official sanction of the 
King of Italy, the King of England, and the 
President of the United States, and to invite 
subscriptions for the purchase of the desired 
house. It took three years to conduct the pre- 
liminary negotiations with the Italian owners 
of the property, and then, with an option on 
its purchase secured, the plan was made pub- 
lic. About a year of effort was required to 
secure the necessary funds (something over 
twenty thousand dollars), and then the property 
was bought by the Association. Gifts of books, 
manuscripts, and works of art suitable for 
preservation in such a place, were then solic- 
ited, and the demand met with a generous 
response. More material gifts were also forth- 
coming, including the furnishing of the rooms 
of the second-floor apartment which Keats occu-

pied, and the Memorial was ready for its formal 
dedication. It should be added that a perpet- 
ual, if modest, endowment fund is provided by 
the rental of the otherwise unoccupied parts of 
the building. 

The dedicatory ceremonies were held April 3, 
1909, in the presence of the King of Italy, the 
British and American Ambassadors, and about 
sixty invited guests, among whom were the 
Rev. Mr. Esdaile, Shelley's grandson, and Mr. 
Arthur Severn, the son of Joseph Severn. Sir 
Rennell Rodd opened the exercises with a few 
well-chosen words, expressing his trust that the 
house will remain in perpetuity " a centre of 
interest and a shrine of pilgrimage to all the 
English-speaking people who come to this hos- 
pitable Italy, which all our poets have loved and 
to which in the century which has lately closed 
a large portion of their genius has been dedi- 
cated." Mr. H. Nelson Gay, admitting that 
England had " furnished the poets " for the 
Memorial, said that America had shared in 
appreciating their genius, reprinting them 
steadily from 1821 onwards. And he added, 
addressing the King : " No project which bears 
the name of Italy can fail to receive enthusiastic 
support across the Atlantic." Mr. R. U. John- 
son, unable to be present, sent a letter paying 
tribute to Keats and Shelley — " the freshness 
of their verse ; their soaring imagination ; the 
exquisite music of their rhythms ; the ardor and 
breadth of their sympathies ; their steadfast con- 
viction of justice as the foundation of human 
government ; the gracious tradition of their per- 
sonal lovableness, and the glowing ideality of 
their devotion to a noble art." 

An address by Signor Ferdinando Martini, 
statesman and scholar, was given in eloquent 
Italian. He brought a continental and quasi- 
political note into the proceedings, calling Keats 
" the Andre Chenier of English poetry, the 
unwearied seeker after the perfection of form," 
and speaking of Shelley's prophetic vision that 
a century ago " perceived Rome rending the 
sacerdotal cowl, and the shepherds of Ausonia 
chasing the northern wolves across the Alps." 
A text from Carducci supplied Signor Martini's 
peroration : 
" Fremono freschi i pini per l'aura grande di Roma, 
Tu dove sei, poeta del liberato mondo ? " 

The Italian poet asked his question of Shelley's 
urn ; the Italian statesman answered it at the 
shrine newly dedicated to Shelley's memory. 
Mr. Arthur Severn, as the last speaker, told of 
the closing weeks of Keats's life, as he had often 



heard the tale from the lips of his own father. 
The King then pronounced the formula of dedi- 
cation, and the proceedings were over. Their 
purport was afterwards summed up in these 
simple and sincere verses by Mr. Harold 
Boulton : 

" From Britain, Empress of the worldwide seas, 
And from that proud republic of the West, 
The new Atlantis of our latter day, 
In April tide to Rome came embassies 
To greet two makers of sweet melodies, 
Where shreds of their mortality find rest 
Mid cypress trees and groves of poet's bay, 
And loving hearts keep green their memories. 
We, lovers of our poets and Italy, 
Are as their children's sons as men count years ; 
These years, to them who soar in Fame's wide spheres, 
Are but one wing-beat in eternity." 

The furnishings of the memorial rooms have 
been provided by the New York Stock Exchange 
(in memory of E.C. Stedman), the late General 
W. J. Palmer of Colorado Springs, Mr. W. K. 
Bixby of St. Louis, and the Woman's Club of 
Minneapolis. The other contents include works 
of art, personal relics, autograph letters, various 
manuscripts, and a library already numbering a 
thousand titles, to which it is expected a second 
thousand will soon be added. The committee 
has wisely decided to extend the scope of the 
Memorial to all the English poets having close 
associations with Italy, in consequence of which 
decision the collection already includes some 
material relating to Byron and Leigh Hunt. 
We trust that it will in time be made to include 
Landor, the Brownings, and Swinburne. We 
have hardly as yet had any American poet of 
high importance (with the possible exception of 
Longfellow), whose Italian associations would 
warrant admission to this distinguished com- 
pany. But the centuries may remedy even this 
defect in our record. 

The greater part of the Bulletin now pub- 
lished is devoted to a catalogue of the library, 
and a reprint of the letters acquired for the 
archives. Of this hitherto unpublished mate- 
rial, the most interesting part is found in a 
group of letters by Trelawny, relating in part 
to Shelley and Byron, and in part to his own 
adventurous enterprises. Letters by Shelley, 
Byron, Severn, and Trelawny are reproduced 
in photographic facsimile. An etching of the 
house, and two photogravure views of interiors, 
complete the list of illustrations. The Bulletin 
has thus documentary value on its own account, 
besides fulfilling its function as a record of the 
history of a peculiarly praiseworthy enterprise, 
now brought to a happy consummation.

THE FIRST AMERICAN STUDENTS 
IN GERMANY. 



A fresh reading of George Ticknor's letters from 
Germany, as they appear in an attractive new edi- 
tion of his " Life, Letters, and Journals," published 
by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Go. and provided with 
an Introduction by Mr. Ferris Greenslet, recalls a 
period in the intellectual development of this country 
which is full of interest for the present generation, 
when so many American students are earning their 
Ph.D.'s in German universities. The influence of the 
German mind over the American mind has played 
so great a role in our intellectual and educational 
history that any facts pertaining to its establishment 
are of interest and value. When the time comes 
to measure the importance and extent of this influ- 
ence, these letters of Ticknor will be a valuable 
source of material. 

It was in August. 1815, when the young Bos- 
tonian whom Mr. Greenslet calls our first cosmo- 
politan scholar arrived in Gottingen, where he was 
to learn the real meaning of scholarship. Ticknor 
was, however, not the first American student to 
enter a German university, although the first to 
leave a published record of his experiences. Benja- 
min Smith Barton, of Pennsylvania, later an eminent 
physician and author of scientific works, had pre- 
ceded him at Gottingen, and had taken his doctor's 
degree there in 1799 ; also W. B. Astor of New 
York, and Edward Everett, whom he found there 
on his arrival, preparing himself for the Greek pro- 
fessorship in Harvard College. 

It is an interesting fact that Ticknor did not 
obtain his first knowledge of Gottingen from any 
one of these three countrymen, but from Madame 
de Stael's work on Germany. This famous book, 
which first saw the light in England in 1813, dis- 
covered intellectual and spiritual Germany not only 
for France, but for the English-speaking world as 
well. The pitiful ignorance of the German language 
and literature prevailing in this country at that time 
is shown by Ticknor's account of his difficulties in 
obtaining some preliminary knowledge of the lan- 
guage of the country where he had decided to study. 
There was no one in Boston who could teach him. 
In Jamaica Plains he found an Alsatian, a teacher 
of mathematics, who was willing to help him, but 
who warned him that he spoke a dialect. He bor- 
rowed a grammar, French and German, from Ed- 
ward Everett : sent to New Hampshire, where he 
knew there was a German dictionary, and obtained 
it ; and after much seeking got hold of a copy of 
■• Werther" for a reading-book. 

At Gottingen the young scholar from over-seas 
found the leading university of Germany, if not 
of Europe. Founded by George the Second, the 
university had enjoyed the special protection of the 
English crown until Hanover was incorporated into 
Westphalia under Jerome Bonaparte. While Napo- 
leon was pillaging the universities of Jena, Halle, and 



Leipzig, he spared Gottingen, which, he declared, 
belonged neither to Hanover nor to Germany, but 
to the world. The University was equally fortunate 
in escaping the clutches of Jerome. Ticknor realized 
at once that he had entered a new world. Among 
the many distinguished scholars and teachers, he 
found two of international reputation — Gauss the 
mathematician, and Blumenbach the naturalist, who 
were attracting students from the whole of Europe. 
For the first time in his life, says his editor, "he 
was made to understand and feel what is meant by 
instruction ;" to know "the difference between recit- 
ing to a man and being taught by him." In a letter 
to his father he thus writes of his Greek tutor Dr. 
Schultze : 

•• Every day I am filled with new astonishment at the 
variety and accuracy, the minuteness and ieadiness of his 
learning. Every day I feel anew . . . what a mortifying 
distance there is between a European and an American 
scholar ! We do not yet know what a Greek scholar is ; we 
do not even know the process by which a man is to be made 
one. Mr. Schultze is hardly older than I am. ... It never 
entered into my imagination to conceive that any expense 
of time or talent could make a man so accomplished in this 
forgotten tongue as he is." 

The new-comer was also amazed by the prevailing 
industry. 

• If I desired to teach anybody the value of time, I would 
send him to spend a semester at Gottingen. Until I began 
to attend the lectures, and go frequently into the streets, I 
had no idea of the accuracy with which it is measured and 
sold by the professors. Every clock that strikes is the signal 
for four or five lectures to begin and four or five others to 
close. In the intervals you may go into the streets and find 
they are silent and empty ; but the bell has hardly told the 
hour before they are filled with students, with their port- 
folios under their arms, hastening from the feet of one 
Gamaliel to those of another, — generally running, in order 
to save time. . . . As soon as they reach the room, they take 
their places and prepare their pens and paper. The pro- 
fessor comes in almost immediately, and from that time till 
he goes out. the sound of his disciples taking notes does not 
for an instant cease. . . . From the accuracy with which 
time is measured, what in all other languages is called a 
lesson is called in German * an hour.' You are never asked 
if you take lessons of such a person ; but whether yon take 
; hours ' of him. . . . Visiting, as it is done in our [American] 
colleges, is a thing absolutely unknown here. If a man, 
who means to have any reputation as a scholar, sees his best 
friend once a week, it is thought quite often enough." 

The library of the university was a constant 
delight to the young student, as well as a reminder 
of the literary poverty of his own country. Speak- 
ing, after his return, of the library of Harvard Col- 
lege, he remarked : 

" When I went away, I thought it was a large library 
when I came back, it seemed a closetful of books." 

The young barbarian from the West excited interest 
in the Gottingen world on his own part Endowed 
by nature with rare social gifts, he was received into 
the homes of his professors on terms of friendship. 
Together with his fellow-student, Everett, he was 
elected to the exclusive literary club of the university, 
a society composed of professors and a few chosen 
students. In reporting this honor to his father, he 
writes : 

" W e were taken in as a kind of raree-show, I suppose.

and we are considered, I doubt not, with much the same 
curiosity that a tame monkey or a dancing bear wonld be. 
We come from such an immense distance, that it is supposed 
we can be hardly civilized ; and it is, I am told, a matter of 
astonishment to many that we are white." 

The young American himself may have been a 
" raree-show " for several distinguished visitors of 
the university of whom we catch glimpses in the 
letters. One of them was Wolf, " the corypheus of 
German philologists," of whom he writes : 

" He was curious about our country, and questioned me 
about our scholars and our scholarship. I told him what I 
could, — -amongst other things, of a fashionable dashing 
preacher of New York having told me that he took great plea- 
sure in reading the choruses of JEschylus, and that he read 
them without the aid of a dictionary ! I was walking with 
Wolf at the time, and on hearing this he stopped, squared 
round, and said, ' He told you that, did he ? ' ' Yes,' I 
answered. ' Very well ; the next time you hear him say it, 
do you tell him he lies, and that I say so.' " 

Ticknor was not in pursuit of a degree ; and after 
a residence of twenty months he set out again on his 
travels, carrying with him an unanswered letter of 
great moment, the offer of the professorships of the 
French and Spanish languages and of Belles Lettres 
at Harvard College. Soon after his return from 
Europe in 1819, he was inducted with solemn cere- 
mony into these new professorships. At Harvard, 
then a college of twenty teachers and three hundred 
students, Ticknor found a state of affairs which would 
have completely discouraged a man of less ardent 
and optimistic temperament. The methods of instruc- 
tion were antiquated, the discipline weak; the govern- 
ing bodies had fallen into a state of laisser-faire, 
which made any change a slow and painful process. 
The reforms proposed by the new professor caused 
a great rattling among the dry bones at Cambridge. 
But the authorities had no taste for methods made in 
Germany, and the changes went no farther than his 
own department. But if Ticknor did not have the 
gratification of seeing many of his suggestions adopted, 
to him belongs the honor of giving the initial impulse 
to the reforms which were finally to change into a 
university the institution which at that time did not 
deserve the name of college. Mr. Greenslet calls 
him "the originator of the university idea in 
America." 

Edward Everett, whom Ticknor had left behind 
at Gottingen, soon came home, bringing with him 
more German books for the Harvard library than 
all the rest of New England possessed. As soon as 
he was established as professor of Greek, one of his 
first acts was to urge upon the president of the col- 
lege the desirability of founding a travelling scholar- 
ship for the purpose of having some promising young 
scholar in training abroad for service to his alma 
mater. The suggestion was acted upon, and the 
choice fell upon George Bancroft, then in his 
eighteenth year. After three years in Gottingen, 
Bancroft returned to his native country, in 1820, 
with the degree of doctor of philosophy. For a 
year he was tutor at Harvard ; but failed to receive 
a permanent appointment, and was also, somewhat 



later, refused permission to read lectures on history 
after the German privat docent method, a privilege 
which would have been granted him in Gottingen. 
Thus Bancroft's efforts to introduce an important 
feature of the German university was unsuccessful, 
and the future historian of his country never lent 
the distinction of his name to the faculty roll of its 
leading university. But the would-be reformer of 
his college is nevertheless entitled to a place in the 
history of American education. With Dr. Joseph 
Green Cogswell, also the holder of a degree from 
Gottingen, he founded in 1823, at Northampton, 
Mass., the famous Round Hill School which was 
largely based upon German ideas. 

After the way had been pointed out, the aspiring 
young scholars of America began to realize that 
" homekeeping youths have ever homely wits," and 
to follow those pioneers in ever-increasing numbers. 
It is a noticeable fact that Gottingen was the shrine 
of most of those early pilgrimages. For the year 
1829 the Book of the American Colony (an organiza- 
tion which still exists) shows the name of Longfellow 
followed under the rubric of " Faculty " by " Schone- 
wissenschaft," an excellent term for the refined 
learning of Ticknor's successor at Harvard. Other 
distinguished names on the colony's roll-book are 
Emerson and Motley. It was at Gottingen that Motley 
formed his famous friendship with Bismarck. Like 
his predecessors, he had already finished his college 
course at home, which fact, however, had not made 
him too serious-minded for the peculiar pleasures of 
a German fighting corps. After his death, the Iron 
Chancellor, in a letter to Dr. Holmes, wrote of his 
old corpsbruder that he studied more than most 
corps members; also that he attempted original 
German poems and had planned a translation of 
Goethe's " Faust." In an account of those early 
Americans at Gottingen, mention should also be 
made of F. H. Hedge, whom Dr. Harris has called 
" the great German scholar thoroughly equipped and 
fully possessed of the German spirit, the German 
fountain among the Transcendentalists." 

The reader may ask why these first Americans 
chose the German universities instead of Oxford and 
Cambridge. One would suppose, without further 
thought, that Oxford "with her dreaming spires" 
would have been the intellectual Mecca of such men 
as Ticknor and Longfellow. The explanation is 
not far to seek : the English universities have never 
treated foreign students with liberality ; nor did their 
peculiar character at the time in question permit of 
that universality of learning which Madame de Stael 
emphasized as characteristic of the universities of 
Germany. " Their teaching begins," she wrote, 
"where that of most other nations ends." To 
trace the full significance and influence of the 
ideas brought back from Germany by these first 
Americans who went there for study will be an 
important duty of the future historian of American 
culture.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The axxual reports of the Carnegie Foun- 
dation* have within a short time come to he looked 
forward to as important expressions of opinion upon 
current problems of higher education. The report 
for 1909 is no exception to this rule, and brings 
some very pertinent comments upon college adver- 
tising, upon financial statements, upon politics in 
State universities, and upon the significance of agri- 
cultural education. But there is one item in the 
report that is certain to command far more general 
attention than any of these, and, indeed, is likely 
to cause consternation in academic circles and to 
arouse a decided word of protest wherever academic 
interests are cherished. The Dial is able to refer 
with pleasure to its strong words of commendation 
of the purposes of the Foundation when the meas- 
ures adopted to promote its aims were first an- 
nounced ; and now, after an experience of only four 
years, it regrets to see one of the two fundamental 
policies, which gave to professors the right of retire- 
ment after twenty-five years of service, suddenly 
and unexpectedly withdrawn. The withdrawal is 
unaccompanied by word of regret, or even of excuse 
for its immediate execution. Retirements under 
this clause are in the future to be limited to cases of 
disability; and it is set forth that because only a 
small proportion of those who have in three or four 
years availed themselves of this privilege did so by 
reason of disability, the result is widely different 
from what was anticipated. Yet there is nothing 
in the original regulations which suggests disability 
as a prime cause for retirement. Indeed, the whole 
set of reasons given to support the decision seem so 
slight as to suggest the presence of a far more 
decisive factor in the probable inadequacy of the 
funds. Now it is a most dangerous policy in uni- 
versity administration to give one set of reasons, 
when in reality the situation is urgent, in terms of 
a very different set. The old injunction to hold 
separate that which is Caesar's and that which has 
higher responsibilities, is not out of place here. It 
must be evident that an announcement that pro- 
fessors may look forward to retiring upon either 
one of two bases which they may personally prefer, 
is equivalent to a promise : and that in view of such 
a promise, the lives and activities of a small but 
worthy part of influential communities will be pro- 
foundly affected. A number of protests against the 
proposed change have already appeared, and all 
point to the conclusion that the only way for the 
Foundation to restore confidence in its policies is to 
postpone the execution of this decision until it is 
made financially necessary. It is particularly im- 
portant that the present obligation which the Foun- 
dation has accepted in regard to those men who in 
five or ten years would look forward to shaping 
their careers with reference to the use of this privi- 
lege, shall not be evaded. It is certainly a most 
regrettable situation that an institution which was 



distinctly created to advance the cause of learning 
and make more favorable the conditions under 
which the academic life in this country is followed 

, should so early in its career have aroused a situation 
the more aggravating because of a benefit conferred 
and withdrawn. It is inevitable that such a situa- 
tion will draw forth, and above all from the friends 

i of the Foundation, a most earnest protest for a 
reconsideration of this unfortunate decision. 

The rain returning after the cloud might 

j be a paraphrase from Scripture to describe the 
process by which great reservoirs of wealth — 

; accumulated by an alchemy scarcely less subtle 
and mysterious than that by which moisture from 
the earth is sucked up into elouds — when over- 
charged yield back their treasures to the source 
whence they came. How much of credit is dne 
to the clouds that "bring fresh showers for the 
thirsting flowers " by discharging moisture they can 

I no longer hold, and how much to the owners of 
the wealth restored, is a matter less vital than the 

: fact of restoration. Considerations of practical wis- 
dom, if nothing more, dictate full recognition of 

1 acts tending toward public good. For such acts, 

I two men in America have long been preeminent ; 
and now one of them, Mr. Rockefeller, has opened 
wider still the gates of his seemingly inexhaustible 
reservoir for purposes of beneficence that might 
almost be described as the general amelioration of 
mankind. A bill incorporating "The Rockefeller 
Foundation," a sort of friendly rival to the Carnegie 
Foundation, has been introduced in Congress and 
referred to the Senate District Committee. In the 
words of the document, the object in view is "to 
promote the well-being and to advance the civiliza- 
tion of the people of the United States and its 
Territories and possessions, and of foreign lands, 
in the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, 
in the prevention and relief of suffering, and in the 

i promotion of any and all the elements of human 
progress." The reported intention of Mr. Rocke- 
feller to give away most of his wealth in his lifetime 
seems in a fair way to be carried out. If it is his 
ambition to die a poor man, while most of the rest 
of us are foolishly nursing the contrary aspiration, 
the cause of learning and enlightenment, of progress 
and of charity, appears likely to profit materially 
thereby. 

The end of a famous journalistic dynasty 
which comprised four generations and dated from 
1788, has come at last in the death of Arthur 
Fraser Walter, great-grandson of the John Walter 
who founded the London "Times," and himself 
since 1894 either chief proprietor, or more recently 
chairman of the board of directors to which the 
management of the paper had passed after Mr. 
Alfred Harmsworth (now Lord Northcliffe) had pur- 
chased a controlling interest. It was in Arthur's 
father's time that the tide of fortune turned against 
the " Thunderer " as a result of its ill-judged pub-

lication of the so-called Parnell letters or Piggott 
forgeries — a performance that is said to have cost 
John Walter nearly a million pounds. The tale 
since then of chancery proceedings, of various alien 
enterprises essayed by the journal (notably the 
u Times Book Club " and the " Encyclopaedia Brit- 
annica " reprint), and of other indications of a loss 
of solidity and prestige, must have been not exactly 
a joyous one to the late Mr. Walter. " The Times " 
without its Walter will seem to many of its old sub- 
scribers and readers quite a different paper. How 
softened is now its thunder as compared with its 
earth-shaking note in the days of J. T. Delane — 
Jupiter Tonans Delane, as he might be called. 

The making of poets and dramatists is now 
a part of the programme of the fully equipped uni- 
versity. A " course in writing poetry " is offered, 
if reports are true, at the Missouri State University ; 
and at Harvard the art of the playwright has for 
some years figured among the things taught in the 
classroom. " The Technique of the Drama. Lec- 
tures and Practice. . . . Three plays are required 
of each student : an adaptation in one act ; an origi- 
nal one-act play ; and a play of at least three acts." 
This is to-day a course in good and regular standing 
in the college on the Charles, under Professor 
George P. Baker's competent direction ; and the 
number of recent Harvard graduates who have 
achieved greater or less distinction in the writing of 
plays, whether for the stage or the closet, seems to 
indicate that at least encouragement and wise coun- 
sel are to be had from the professor of the dramatic 
art — who may himself never have written an acting 
play in his life. The endeavor is now being made 
to endow a professorship of dramatic literature at 
Harvard, and to raise money for the building of a 
suitable theatre for the use of the Harvard Dramatic 
Association. . . . 

The restoration of Homer to his old-time 
throne on the very peak of Parnassus, whence 
Wolf and later disbelievers in any such man as 
Homer had hurled him down as an empty impostor, 
a mere name and nothing more, has been at least 
partially effected by a little pamphlet in which Pro- 
fessor John A. Scott of Northwestern University 
adduces proof to show that the disputed ninth, 
tenth, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth books of the 
Iliad contain no more peculiar or suspiciously recent 
terms than do the other books. This scholarly 
attempt to give us back our blind bard is appre- 
ciatively welcomed by no less a Grecian and 
Homeric scholar than Mr. Andrew Lang, who con- 
tributes to the London "Morning Post" a com- 
mendatory and interesting column on the general 
subject of Mr. Scott's pamphlet, and adds in closing : 
" Meanwhile, an English scholar, Miss Stawell, of 
Newnham College, has done for the comparative 
grammar and metre of the Iliad and Odyssey what 
Mr. Scott has done for the vocabulary, with the 
same results, in her 'Homer and the Iliad.' Thus 
the higher criticism may be said to have collapsed." 



The Southern Library Training School, 
established five years ago by Mr. Carnegie, and 
since 1907 known as the Library Training School 
of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta, issues a small 
and business-like " Circular of Information," from 
which we learn that it now enjoys a permanent 
income of four thousand five hundred dollars — 
thanks to its founder — and has a Faculty of seven, 
all women. Its course covers three terms, extend- 
ing from late September to the end of May, and 
amounting to 464 hours of classroom work. The 
subjects taught are grouped under seven general 
heads, and seem well selected to cover the essentials 
of library science. The school cannot, of course, 
expect to turn out in one year a ready-made Panizzi 
or Poole or Putnam ; but there appears no reason 
why the young person who has it in him or her to 
become a librarian should not get a fair start at the 
Atlanta school. The moderateness of the expense 
involved is an attractive feature of the course. 
There is still in the South abundant room for library 
training schools, as there is also for libraries. 

The persistence of poetry, despite the insig- 
nificance of the material reward offered to even the 
most successful of poets, is a thing which may make 
the aspiring poet take heart again. The amount of 
verse, and good verse, now being published in En- 
gland is by no means small ; and the amount seek- 
ing publication is many times larger. Mr. Stephen 
Gwynn, writing in the " Nineteenth Century," com- 
pares the present age with the period immediately 
succeeding Shakespeare's death ; both alike showing 
a great variety of genuine and delightful poetry. He 
makes a study of two recent poets, Messrs. James 
Stephens and W. H. Davies, and maintains that good 
verse, however limited its sale, has a far better chance 
of being remembered — of achieving immortality, we 
might say — than any prose writing of corresponding 
excellence. The novel, the book of essays, the his- 
tory, the biography, please most at the first reading, 
and seldom do they receive a second ; but the poem 
gives increasing pleasure the oftener it is read. 

• • • 

"Making culture hum" with the humming 
wheels of industry seems to be a matter of keen 
concern in the educational world just now, if we 
may judge from the advertisements of not a few 
academies and colleges and even universities. In 
his current report, President Pritchett of the Car- 
negie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
animadverts upon certain features of college adver- 
tising. The transgression of the bounds of aca- 
demic propriety, and even of common decency, in 
the effort to draw students, is much deplored. 
Among certain more or less astonishing or amusing 
devices noted by Dr. Pritchett as resorted to by 
some of our enterprising institutions of learning, we 
read the following alluring offer from a Virginia 
college : " To any parent who has twelve children, 
ten of them living, two of them in the college at 
the same time, one free literary tuition will be given ;

if only one is sent, one-half tuition will be given." 
This combined appeal to the anti-race-suicide in- 
stinct and the love of polite learning should be 
tremendously effective. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE " BEST SELLER ■ AND ROMANCE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Isn't the contributor who writes of the "genteel 
atmosphere " of the " best seller " a little too hard on 
the reading public ? Is it the gentility of high life that 
they crave, or the romance ? And surely the craving 
for romance is a legitimate emotion, and the greatest 
art, as well as the most flagrant artifice, satisfies it. 

For my part, I don't believe it is because we are such 
snobs that we like to read about princes and heiresses, 
motor-cars, European tours, Worth gowns, and expen- 
sive cafe's ; it is because we are romantic. We can 't, in 
this matter-of-fact age, thoroughly believe in fairies, 
Alladin's lamp, white magic, and all the other pleasant 
possibilities that in the " good old days " used to alle- 
viate the unendurable commonplaceness of humdrum 
existence. But one magic power is still left us — money. 
We see it — we who have n't it — oiling the wheels to 
wonderful speed and efficiency. 

" Life "s a gift scarce worth receivin', 
And we hae muckle care and gTievin'; 

But, oiled by thee, 
The wheels o' life gang down-hill, scrievin 1 
Wi' rattlin' glee."' 
Money brings mountains to Mahomet or Mahomet to 
the mountains, according as Mahomet decrees; trans- 
forms ugliness to beauty, dullness to piquant adventure. 
We know, in our sober senses, that this modern magic 
has its limitations — that there are many things it can't 
give its fortunate possessors; but we would like to try, 
for once in a way, what it could do for us, with our 
talents, our ingenuity, our zest for the joy of living. 

Of course that is the real magic, ancient or modern, 
— zest for the joy of living; but it would be too much 
to expect of the average man that he should find it out, 
or even believe it ; money-magic appeals to his material 
mind. And so, while craving for romance remains a 
leading motive in the doings of this work-a-day world, 
the beggar-maid cannot get into the " best seller " — 
unless she marries the King. The realist may depict 
the weary round of petty tasks with wonderful adroit- 
ness and discrimination ; he will never write a " best 
seller." So I consider the " genteel atmosphere " too 
Philistine an expression. I should state the formula 
of the " best seller " thus : a presentation of people like 
ourselves, doing what we want to do, in places where 
we want to be, — and that, for most of us, unanalytic 
and little experienced in the ironies of life, means in 
places where the modern magic doth much abound, not 
because it is " genteel " to be rich, but because it is, 
as we thoughtlessly suppose, delightfully, unbelievably 
romantic. Margaret Va>*ck.

cases such as those to which he refers, of the old habit 
of printing the " catchword " at the foot of the page ? — 
j i.e., print the first word of the line which begins on the 
next page, thus: 

The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, 

And 

Charles Welsh. 
Winthrop, Mass^ March 7, 1910. 

[Apparently Mr. Welsh does not quite apprehend 
the difficulty pointed out by oar previous correspond- 
ent, who complained that in reading books of 
poetry he often was perplexed by the absence of any- 
thing at the bottom of a page to indicate at a glance 
whether the last line completed a stanza, or the stanza 
was divided at that point and carried over to the next 
page. This applies particularly, of course, to stanzas 
of different lengths, and when the hist line on a page 
ends with a period. We do not see that the catch- 
word would help the matter in the example given, 
the comma and the single line being sufficient indica- 
tion of a divided stanza. Nor would Mr. House's 
suggestion of a blank line at the bottom of a page and 
another at the top of the following one be practically 
effective. The confusion arises, of course, from the 
fact that usage gives no other means of dividing 
stanzas than their separation by much more blank 
space than that used between other lines in the same 
book. Unless dashes or dots, or other mechanical 
signs, are used to separate stanzas, the evil will have 
to be endured ; although it is one that affects, whether 
they understand it or not, all careful readers of 
poetry. — Edr. The Dial.] 



THE USE OF THE "PRINTER'S CATCHWORD." 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The typographical perplexity set forth by a corre- 
spondent in your last issue has doubtless been experienced 
by many other readers of books of poetry. Would not 
a simple way out of the difficulty be the adoption, in 



ORIGIN OF A STOCK PHRASE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I wish someone could inform me what he believes to 
be the origin of that lugubrious stock phrase, " in the 
cold and silent grave." Does it belong to some frater- 
nity ritual, some early dirge or hymn, some novel or 
history, — or what ? It certainly is not of the Bible, 
nor of Bryant's " Thanatopsis." Yet it has the sound 
of a threadbare adage, worn out of gentle usage, but 
of some original pretensions. Can anyone tell ? 

S. T. Kidder. 
McGregor, Iowa, March 5, 1910. 

[We should regard the phrase as the property of 
anyone who cared to use it, — one of those obvious 
collocations like " a cold, dreary day in November," 
"a mild, balmy spring day," "the bustling, noisy 
city," with no known origin except the dictionary. 
Turning the words over in one's mind, they do take 
on, as our correspondent says, "the sound of a 
threadbare adage." Did not Curran, in his court- 
room speech, say to his judges, "My lamp of life 
is nearly extinguished ; I am going to the cold and 
silent grave"? Yet he did not need to have taken 
the words from Sir Walter Raleigh, who, in bines 
written on the night before his death, spoke of 
" the dark and silent grave." And the words have 
doubtless been used innumerable times by others, 
who never knew of their use by Curran or by 
Raleigh. — Edr. The Dial.]

A Traveller in the Porbiddex Laxd.* 

The source of the Indus has for centuries 
lain hidden in the mountain fastnesses of the 
great central plateau of Asia, as secure from the 
contaminating gaze of the European explorer 
as is still Dangra-yum-tso, the sacred lake of 
the Tibetans. But the head-waters of the Indus, 
the Brahmaputra, and the Sutlej have at last 
been mapped by the dreaded foreigner, though 
the intrepid Sven Hedin still finds every ap- 
proach to the lake of holy waters barred by 
armed horsemen. 

Travelling in Tibet evidently lacks the com- 
forts of home, and offers no substitutes save 
the satisfaction of leaving on the map of Asia 
the record of a massive range of mountains 
happily christened the " Trans-Himalaya," of 
completing the survey of the head- waters of 
three great rivers of the continent, and of filling 
in the geographic details of certain bands across 
that great white place on the map which for- 
merly bore only the laconic label " Unexplored." 
It is cold in Tibet, even in summer. The 
monsoon blows incessantly day and night. The 
snows begin early in autumn and continue till 
late in the spring. Hedin's route on the great 
plateau was all of it at an altitude exceeding 
12,000 feet, and often over 18,000. For two 
years, through summer's blinding storms and 
winter's baffling snows, he pushed doggedly on, 
wearing out caravan after caravan of horses, 
mules, yaks, even goats and sheep, in a grim 
battle with the forces of nature, crossing and 
re-crossing eight different passes of the Trans- 
Himalaya range. The reader is compelled by 
the modesty of the writer to re-read the simple 
account of his mid-winter battle with the ele- 
ments in the desert and desolate Karokorum 
Mountains, in order to appreciate fully the 
magnitude of the task and the success of its 
accomplishment. Obliged by the secret nature 
of his enterprise to discard most of the appur- 
tenances of the civilization to which he had 
bidden farewell a year before, accompanied by 
a mere handful of ignorant but faithful Lada- 
kis, without guides in a trackless wilderness of 
snowclad peaks, he brought the remnant of his 
little caravan through by sheer force of leader-

ship. Conditions of temperature, altitude, and 
storm tested the powers of human endurance 
almost as severely as in polar explorations. 
The courage with which Hedin attempted to 
penetrate these unknown mountain fastnesses 
in the dead of winter at altitudes towering far 
above Alpine summits is not less than sublime. 
He has made Trans-Himalayan the superlative 
of Alpine in the vocabulary of mountaineering. 
The desert is swept by blinding dust and sand 
storms ; water is scanty and found with diffi- 
culty, and then all too often bitter or salt. 
Nomads' trails are followed at one's peril, while 
fuel and fodder are scarce ; for Tibet is much 
of it a treeless desert. 

There is no playing to the galleries in Hedin's 
portrayal of the thrilling parts of his narrative. 
A touch of rhetorical effect is reserved for the 
sentimental treatment which he gives to the loss 
of his faithful beasts of burden or to the various 
and sundry litters of puppies added to his cara- 
van, for the reflections on the lives of the self- 
immured lamas, or for the gruesome details of 
the revolting customs which the Tibetans use in 
the disposal of their dead. The narrative of his 
travels is detailed and encyclopaedic. He sees 
Tibet through a geographer's eyes, and describes 
it with geographical completeness. No particu- 
lar of elevation, orographic structure, or rate of 
flow of stream, no configuration of distant moun- 
tain range, escapes his nimble recording pencil. 
He fairly revels in geographic detail ; the hur- 
ried or casual reader can hardly see Tibet for 
the landscape. It is but fair to characterize the 
book as one of exploration rather than travel, of 
information rather than mere entertainment. 
The pages afford abundant and carefully re- 
corded data regarding the country and people 
along the routes, enlivened continually by the 
minor details of human interest, by the minutiae 
of caravan life, of his horses, yaks, and dogs, 
and even of his sheep, which often served as 
refractory beasts of burden when horses and 
yaks failed. One soon comes to know the mem- 
bers of his caravan, — the intelligent Robert 
from the mission station at Srinagar, the only 
Eurasian in his following ; the efficient Muhamed 
Isa, his caravan bashi ; and crafty Panchor, the 
grafting guide, friend of all the nomad robbers. 
His followers, in spite of the perils into which 
he led them, and great physical discomforts to 
which they were subjected, gave him yeoman 
service, and parted from him with tears and 
lamentations.

of fuel and water, were not the only obstacles 
Hedin had to overcome. Tibet was closed to all 
foreigners, by formal agreement of four nations 
noted for their astute diplomacy — Tibet, China, 
Great Britain, and Russia. All appeals to the 
Liberal Government in England for permission 
to enter the forbidden land by way of India met 
with courteous but firm refusal. Baffled at 
Simla in his efforts to enter from the south, he 
plunged into Kashmir and entered Tibet from 
the northwest, reaching Shigatse, one hundred 
and fifty miles from Lhasa, through the sparsely- 
peopled country of the nomad tribes, before the 
Tibetan authorities stopped him and firmly com- 
pelled him to leave the country. A diplomatic 
battle-royal ensued, in which the explorer's 
" religious scruples " against returning by the 
route by which he entered stood him in good 
stead ; for Tibetans are the most religious people 
in the world, and gave his geographical conscience 
its just dues in so far that they permitted him to 
zigzag his way back to the Kashmir frontier along 
a formerly explored route. A new agreement of 
Great Britain and Russia, in which China was 
requested to concur, expressly forbade for a 
period of three years all scientific expeditions 
into Tibet. This rendered doubly difficult all 
attempts to creep back into the forbidden land. 
The author says : 

" The country of Tibet will doubtless in the future 
be closed as strictly as hitherto ; for the supremacy over 
Tibet is a political question of the first importance to 
China, not ouly because Tibet is, as it were, a huge fortress 
with ramparts, walls, and ditches, protecting China, but 
also on account of the great spiritual iufluence which 
the two popes exercise over all Mongolians. As long as 
China has the Dalai Lama in its power, it can keep the 
Mongols in check; while in other circumstances the 
Dalai Lama could stir them up to insurrection against 
China. And Mongolia is also the buffer-state between 
China and Russia." 

A new caravan was, however, secretly equipped 
in Kashmir which, starting ostensibly northward, 
plunged again in mid-winter into Western Tibet 
through the uninhabited wastes of Kuen-Lun, 
only to be stopped again after crossing once more 
the Trans- Himalayan range, and ordered post- 
haste from the land. Once more " religious " 
scruples and clever diplomacy won for Hedin the 
privilege of a circuitous route outward, and made 
possible a number of important additions to the 
maps of Tibet. 

The two bulky volumes of the present work 
do not afford opportunity for the full story of 
the return trip and the difficult traverse of the 
Himalayas by a new route. This, with an 
account of Tibetan monasteries, and of the trip 
through Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, is prom- 



ised in a later work ; while the youthful appetite 
for adventure is to be supplied by a selection of 
thrilling Tibetan experiences. 

The illustrations of the work are exceptionally 
fine and very abundant. The author's sketches 
are confessedly not works of art, but they give 
a vivid impression of the atmospheric color- 
effects in this great plateau, and of scenes in the 
great monastery of Shigatse, while also enliven- 
ing and enlarging the reader's appreciation of 
places, peoples, and incidents. Few books of 
exploration contain so much information so well 
told as these volumes of Hedin's about the For- 
bidden Land. Charles Atwood Kofoid. 



Our Diplomatic Dealings with Spaix.* 

The war with Spain, which resulted in the 
j transfer of Porto Rico and the Philippines to 
1 the United States and in the establishment of 
l substantial American control over Cuba, has 
| already formed the topic of a large literature. 
Of this literature, much, as might be expected 
where the matter deals with events so close at 
hand, is partisan ; much is incomplete ; and still 
i more lacks the higher intellectual authority 
and judgment which come from the larger view 
possible only where events are placed in their 
true perspective with reference to others by 
being viewed down a vista of years. Admiral 
Chadwick's volume on the diplomatic relations 
of the United States and Spain is an acceptable 
and valuable contribution to the growing body 
of material dealing with the Spanish war, and 
it has the additional merit (as the title intimates) 
of presenting a study of our recent relations 
with Spain simply as the latest steps in a long 
series of negotiations extending back to " diffi- 
culties which had their seed in the peace of 
I 1763." The book has thus a broad historical 
' quality which marks it out as more than a con- 
tribution to contemporary politics, although of 
I its 610 pages about a third are devoted to the 
years 1895-1898. 

Admiral Chadwick, after a general introduc- 
; tion, begins with a chapter on the attitude of 
Spain in the American Revolution, and follows 
this with a discussion of the treaty of 1795 
which came as a result of the intrigue and dis- 
content in Louisiana. The question of Florida, 
the negotiations of 1804-5, and the collateral 
historical events, are carefully covered. Later,

the author turns to our proposed alliance with 
Great Britain, which gave place to trafficking 
with France. Napoleon's invasion of Spain and 
its effect in this country, the relations of Great 
Britain and Spain, Spanish land-grants, and the 
position of the United States regarding these 
questions and the South American situation, 
carry Admiral Chad wick to the end of his eighth 
chapter. His ninth section is an interesting 
discussion of the Holy Alliance, Canning's posi- 
tion on American affairs, and the Congress of 
Verona. This leads by natural stages to the 
development of the Monroe Doctrine and the 
origin of the Panama Congress. Our attitude 
toward slavery and the Cuban question, and our 
assurances to Spain in 1840 and the following 
years, are then dealt with. Admiral Chad wick 
gives substantial attention to Cuban affairs, and 
continues with a valuable discussion of the rela- 
tions of Cuba and the United States during the 
decade 1850-1860, which brings his history to 
the opening of the Civil War, and closes his 
thirteenth chapter. The author recognizes the 
important bearing which our abolition of slavery 
had upon the Cuban question, and this recogni- 
tion shows itself throughout his subsequent dis- 
cussion of our dealings with Spain. He reviews 
with care and detail President Grant's Cuban 
views, the position of Secretary Fish, and the 
events which ultimately led to the disturbances 
in Cuba and to our forcible interference. In 
all these matters the great merit of Admiral 
Chadwick's book is seen in his reliance upon 
state papers and direct historical sources ; while 
the main criticism on his use of material must 
be that he has apparently employed but little 
Spanish documentary information. 

The chief immediate interest in this study of 
our relations with Spain will, however, lie largely 
in Admiral Chadwick's later chapters in which 
he deals with the events subsequent to 1895. 
Here he has considered at length the attitude of 
the Cleveland administration toward the Cuban 
question and the Spanish government generally, 
the policy of Secretary Olney, Spain's lack of un- 
derstanding of the feeling in the United States, 
the position assumed by President McKinley, 
the condition of the Cuban people, General 
Weyler, his policy and his final recall, the 
regime established by Consul General Lee in 
Cuba and his relations with the military authori- 
ties there, the destruction of the Maine, the find- 
ings of the court of inquiry thereon, conditions 
at Madrid, and the opening of the war. It is 
one of the most interesting features of this part 
of the work, that Admiral Chadwick concedes 



fully and frankly that Spain had by the begin- 
ning of April, before the final break which led 
to war, practically accepted American demands 
with regard to Cuba, in full. Much of the mat- 
ter in this portion of the volume is, in fact, a 
transcript of documentary matter carefully 
selected and put together. He regards the war 
as " the final act in the struggle for supremacy 
between Anglo-Saxons and men of the Latin race 
in North America, in which Philip, Elizabeth, 
Drake, Howard, Chatham, Vernon, Wolf, Mont- 
calm, Washington, all had a part. The expedi- 
tion of the Great Armada, the murderous early 
struggles in Carolina and Florida, the seven 
years' war which drove France from the Amer- 
can continent, were but acts in the drama the 
culmination of which, in 1898, left the Anglo- 
Saxon and the American in Mexico masters of 
the whole of the northern continent. It was the 
end of a race struggle which had lasted full three 
hundred years." 

Admiral Chadwick's book will be a valuable 
compendium of diplomatic information relative 
to relations with Spain from Colonial days down 
to the present. Its expressions of opinion are, as 
far as they relate to recent history, sufficiently 
few and sufficiently dispassionate. Although 
the writer's sympathies are plainly evident, they 
are nowhere unduly thrust forward or presented 
in a biased way. Indeed, at times one wishes 
there had been less citation of papers and more 
critical analysis ; but this error, if it be such, is on 
the side of safety, and will not be objected to by 
the student. It is probably true that an examina- 
tion of Spanish archives, and the publication of 
such matter relative to recent events as is neces- 
sarily to be expected at a later date, will supply 
information upon certain matters which Admiral 
Chadwick has been compelled to deal with in a 
relatively incomplete way. For the present, he 
has performed an extremely useful service in 
giving to the public this extensive historical 
review of our relations with that nation which 
first opened the American continent to civiliza- 
tion and development. H. Parker Willis. 



A literary fraud of an uncommonly cold-blooded 
kind is announced from Paris, in connection with the 
Empress Eugenie. In anticipation of the death of this 
aged woman, some unscrupulous publishers are said to 
have concocted a volume of pretended memoirs, to be 
foisted upon the market as soon as she departs this life. 
The nefarious scheme is exposed and vigorously de- 
nounced by M. Jules Clare*tie, who says : " I have been 
solemnly assured that the Empress, who has chosen to 
keep silent with regard to the events of the past, has 
not written a single line of these ' Memoirs ' that are to 
be attributed to her."

The Prophet of Modern Music* 

In the year 1685 there were born in Germany 
two men whose future task it was to lay the 
foundation of the art which is distinctively that 
of modern times. Sculpture is Greek, architec- 
ture is ancient and mediaeval, painting belongs 
to the Renaissance, poetry is universal and free 
from time limitations : but music has reached 
its development in the last two centuries. The 
remarkable men referred to were Bach and 
Handel. Born in the same year, they also took 
their flight from earth in the same decade. The 
one came of a long musical ancestry, the other 
relied upon his own inborn genius. They were 
engaged upon the same great task ; they were 
actuated by similar motives and purposes ; they 
made a noble contribution to the happiness and 
elevation of mankind. 

They united in themselves the best attain- 
ments of their predecessors, and they made con- 
quests that were impossible to earlier men. 
Music had been decisively developing in its 
elements and resources. The forms of the com- 
position, the perfection of the instruments, the 
upbuilding of structures vast and impressive, 
solicited the attention and determined the ener- 
gies of the followers of the art. Bach and Handel 
came as the leaders and chief exponents of an 
art that had a numerous body of votaries. The 
instrument that was making extraordinary ad- 
vances was the organ ; the song that was chal- 
lenging the composer for its richer development 
was the religious choral ; the orchestra in its 
independence was making an appeal quite irre- 
sistible : the opera had found a congenial climate 
in Italy, and the Germans were eager and active 
in its introduction into their more serious land. 
There were remarkable executants and writers — 
Frescobaldi, with his novel and brilliant audaci- 
ties; Pachelbel, possessing the Teutonic thorough- 
ness : and, greatest of all, Buxtehude, exercising 
a powerful influence on his students and followers. 

The young John Sebastian Bach responded 
ardently to these stimulating demands, and felt 
able to bring to successful conclusion what the 
others were not yet ready to accomplish. He 
found himself the centre of a large and splendid 
activity, and his place was first among those who 
did the most and carried the art of music farthest 
on its way. 

He was born at Eisenach, in Germany, and 
came of a family of musicians. For generations

ment of a Great Personality. By C. Hubert H. Parry. New 
York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



the Bachs had been devoted to the art, and num- 
bered many notable men among their kindred. 
Their gifts all descended to the great man who 
made them partakers of his fame — who concen- 
trated in himself all the tendencies of his time, 
and was the genuine forerunner and progenitor 
of that achievement in music which places it side 
by side with the highest artistic attainments of 
the world. Bach lost both parents while he was 
very young, and went to live with an older 
brother, John Christoph, who was a musician 
of some eminence, and who held an appoint- 
ment as organist in Ohrdruff, a village not far 
from Eisenach. Of this period in his life Sir 
Hubert Parry says : 

" In such a home new influences inevitably began to 
operate. Without laying undue stress on the difference 
between the art of a town musician and that of a musi- 
cian attached to a church establishment, it cannot be 
gainsaid that the regular, quiet, orderly, and sober 
existence of an organist of a church, the peculiar artis- 
tic atmosphere, and the kind of work which falls to his 
lot to do, are liable to exert a great and basting influence 
upon the unfolding mind of a young musician. The 
better part of such influence is sobering. It leads to 
the concentration of the faculties upon the actual facts 
of art and to finding pleasure and reward in them 
rather than in the applause which brilliant individual 
achievement, either as performer or composer, may 
evoke. And under this influence it is easy to see that 
the character of the young musician soon received a 
permanent bent." 

The education of the youth was carefully 
attended to, but at best it was not anything 
that we should nowadays regard as adequate. 
He was a pupil of Pachelbel's, and during his 
earlier life he made a number of expeditions to 
study with certain leading men, notably Bbhm 
and Buxtehude, and with the latter he remained 
so long over his leave of absence that he was in 
danger of losing the post which he then held. 
Like Shakespeare and Beethoven, his chief edu- 
cation came from his independent using and 
bringing to perfection of the great powers with 
which he found himself endowed, as soon as he 
arrived at self-consciousness. He was thrown 
upon his own resources early ; at the age of 
fifteen he held a position in the convent school 
of St. Michael's at Liineberg, for which he 
received an insignificant stipend. He had sub- 
sequent appointments at Arnstadt, at Weimar, 
at Cothen, and at last went to Leipsic and was 
made cantor of the St. Thomas School, a place 
which he held until his death in 1750. He 
was also organist of the two leading churches 
in Leipsic. He was twice married, and left a 
large number of children, some of whom attained 
considerable musical distinction. He was a man 



196 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



of sturdy independence of character, serious and 
deeply religious ; he was honored at his death, 
but his full recognition was left to men and 
times that succeeded him. 

The period of Bach's novitiate closed with 
his call to Weimar in 1708. He had attained 
his Meisterschaft, and now began the mature 
period of his splendor as a composer. He was 
an indefatigable worker ; his creative power 
came from an apparently inexhaustible source, 
and his productions — cantatas, motets, tocca- 
tas, fugues, passion music, masses — proceeded 
in a never-ending stream. His life broadened 
and deepened at Weimar ; he came in contact 
with the reigning Duke, he found himself in 
association with men of his own type and tem- 
perament. Moreover, the Protestantism there 
was of the Orthodox rather than the Pietist 
kind. As the present biographer says : " He 
(the Duke of Weimar) belonged to the group 
which was distinguished technically as being 
orthodox, among whose objects it was to main- 
tain the ancient musical traditions of the 
Church, as distinguished from the Pietists, to 
whom anything in the shape of artistic accesso- 
ries and appeals to the poetic imagination was 
abhorrent. So in this respect John Sebastian 
was sure of a field to exercise his powers." 

During the Weimar period Bach sounded the 
heights and depths of the cantata. He unfolded 
this form as no man before him had done, and 
he fashioned a unity of chorals which practically 
brought into the world a new work of art. 
Some of his greatest achievements belong to this 
time. Toccatas and fugues and fantasies of 
astonishing amplitude gave evidence of his mas- 
tery. He had become conscious of his art and 
its infinite resources. 

Sir Hubert Parry finds it somewhat difficult 
to assign a reason for Bach's willingness to 
leave Weimar, where so much had been to his 
mind, and where such successes had been won. 
The reasons were probably more subjective than 
would strike the simple on-looker. At Cothen 
a new field of his art allured him. The organ 
should not exclusively call him devotee ; the 
larger opportunities of the orchestra were open- 
ing to him. Composers before him and around 
him, in Italy and in Germany, — Corelli, Scar- 
latti, Reinken, — were bringing into play the 
special characteristics and resources of the vari- 
ous instruments, and, as our author says : 

" Bach's energy in exploring the possibilities of secu- 
lar instrumental music during the time when he was at 
Cothen seems to have been all-embracing. His oppor- 
tunities of hearing such music were plentiful, and there 



being no special inducements to write choral music on a 
grand scale, his mind was more free to address itself to 
various forms of this large branch of art." 

So we get his concertos and suites for different 
instruments, his overtures, his sonatas, accom- 
panied or unaccompanied, for the violin, and 
his epoch-making " Wohltemperirtes Clavier." 
The next step will of course be to put all these 
musical resources together. But before that 
occurs, there is another migration, the last, to a 
larger field of labor. He takes up his sojourn 
in Leipsic, where he remains until his death. 
He succeeded Kuhnau, a versatile and distin- 
guished musician, as cantor of the Thomas 
Schule, a foundation under the control of the 
City Council. He now returns to the produc- 
tion of cantatas, but with the largeness and mas- 
tery that came from full maturity of power, and 
the high consciousness thereof. He also attains 
the recognition of the universality of the musical 
forms, and, although a consistent Protestant, 
pours his religious ardor into the moulds fur- 
nished by the Church Catholic. To this period 
belong the chief successes of his career, the 
imposing Magnificat, the Mass in B minor to 
which no epithet except incomparable is applica- 
ble, and the wonderful Matthew Passion Music. 
With these are to be grouped the Fugue in B 
minor, the grand Toccata in F, and the Fantasia 
in G minor. His work draws to a close, and his 
end is only another example of the ingratitude 
of an unthinking generation, and the failure of 
those near the benefactor to take him for what 
he is. 

Bach belongs with the great upbuilders of 
music ; it was his to give consistent form to the 
masses of material long accumulating, to seize 
upon the characteristics of instrument after 
instrument and find for each its place in the 
great whole, to show what could be done with 
the concerto, the sonata, the mass, and to bring 
them into that perfection of form which could 
alone lead to their setting forth their complete 
significance. With Palestrina as his genuine 
predecessor, and Handel as his compeer and co- 
adjutor, he made of music a vehicle of expression 
not to be surpassed. He was both the consum- 
mation of what preceded him and the prophet 
of what was to come. No art had taken so long 
a time to ripen and mature as Music. He was 
the chosen instrumentality to bring its elements 
together. Of his musical accomplishment, Sir 
Hubert Parry says: 

" For over one hundred and fifty years since Bach's 
death composers have been constantly endeavoring to 
enhance their artistic resources; and yet with all their 
devoted and unsparing efforts they do not appear to 



1910.]

have got much beyond the standard of his achievements. 
In some respects indeed they seem like people who 
have turned aside from a path which appeared rather 
too arduous and have gone a long way round, only to 
find themselves after a long climb at much the same 
place as they started from." 

The opera was in full blast with Reiser in 
the neighboring town of Hamburg, and Bach 
visited there ; he also met the composer Hasse, 
at Dresden. He was not allured, however, into 
any efforts in the direction which these men had 
taken. His great contemporary, Handel, spent 
years in the production of operas, but at last 
abandoned them for the serious work of his 
life. The music of Italy had some attraction 
for Bach ; the charm and fluency of its melody 
held him with its fascination, as they must hold 
everyone ; but he wove the lighter strands suc- 
cessfully into his stronger texture, and gave 
them such use and privilege as conduced to the 
fulfilment of his more strenuous aims. Poly- 
phony, of which he was the great master, has 
found a triumphant re-birth in Beethoven, 
Wagner, Strauss. 

After Bach's death, the world gave him small 
attention ; his manuscripts were divided among 
his sons, and posterity was in danger of losing 
them. Fortunately, the younger son, Philipp 
Emanual, took care of his portion, — the elder 
son, Friedmann, being dissipated and disposing 
of the precious works at his need and caprice, 
thus causing an irreparable loss. For a time 
Bach was in an eclipse ; but he was sure to 
come into his own. The resuscitation owes 
much to the enthusiasm of Mendelssohn and 
Schumann, Franz and Wagner ; to-day and for 
all time he stands among the dii majores in the 
realm of art. 

The work of Sir Hubert Parry occupies a 
place in the field of English musical literature 
quite its own ; we have few works to compare 
with it; the voluminous life by Spitta has, 
indeed, been translated, but its encyclopaedic 
character puts it into the domain of the special 
student. The present life of Bach is both for 
the student and the general reader. It is illu- 
minating in its discussion of Bach's music; it 
presents all aspects of the master's career fully 
and with insight ; it is sympathetic and highly 
appreciative. The large learning of the author 
has been put under contribution ; the great sub- 
ject has been treated in the style and with the 
reverence which it demands. It is an admirable 
book. The publishers have recognized their 
obligation and sent forth a fine volume with 
appropriate illustrations.

Jo ax of Arc: Ax Anti-Clerical, View.* 

After nearly five centuries, Jeanne d'Arc has 
been formally enrolled among the beatified. In 
the minds of many devout Frenchmen she has 
long held the place of a saint ; but not till 
recently were her partisans able to produce argu- 
ments of a sufficiently convincing character to 
secure favorable action at Rome. But not all 
Frenchmen, it appears, regard the act of beatifi- 
cation in a serious light ; while good churchmen 
were seeking arguments to prove that the shep- 
herdess of Domremi was a worker of miracles, 
a famous literary artist was also examining the 
historical documents of the fifteenth century, and 
was gradually developing the theory that the 
strange and mysterious behavior of the Maid was 
merely the result of a morbid " hallucinated " 
mind acting on the fraudulent suggestions of 
selfish priests. 

M. Anatole France published his biography 
in 1908. It encountered an immediate and 
almost violent opposition. That the clerical 
elements should be hostile, is not strange ; more 
significant is the attitude of the professional his- 
torians, many of whom refused to regard the 
work as anything more than an anti-clerical brief. 
In the preface to the present (English) edition, 
the author admits that the reviewers had " dis- 
covered in this work certain errors "; but these 
he tells us have been eliminated. And he adds : 

" The hagiographers alone are openly hostile. They 
reproach me, not with my manner of explaining the facts, 
but with having explained them at all. . . . And these 
zealous inquisitors, so intent on condemning my work, 
have failed to discover therein any grave fault, any fla- 
grant inexactness. Their severity has had to content 
itself with a few inadvertences and with a few printer's 
errors." 

It is interesting to find that among the " hagio- 
graphers " we shall have to class such writers as 
the late M. Achille Luchaire, who knew medi- 
aeval France as few scholars have known it ; and 
Mr. Andrew Lang, who refused to accept M. 
France's biography as definitive, and promptly 
proceeded to write another in refutation (see The 
Dial, April 16, 1909) ; and Mr. F. C. Lowell, 
who once wrote an excellent biography of the 
Maid, and who characterizes the work of the great 
romancer as "dangerously untrustworthy." 

M. France's conception of his subject is 
totally different from the conventional one. He 
sees her as the rather commonplace shepherdess, 
subject to mental aberrations in the form of

hallucinations. She is good and saintly, — the 
author repeatedly emphasizes her saintliness, 
but his conception of a mediaeval saint is such 
that the term is scarcely a compliment. Jeanne's 
peculiar mental state he believes to have inter- 
ested the local clergy ; and soon, after a little 
careful coaching, the "hallucinated lass" is 
transformed into a prophetess. 

" Had this idea of a holy militant mission, 
conceived by Jeanne through the intermediary 
of her voices, come into her mind spontaneously 
without the intervention of any outside will, or 
had it been suggested to her by someone who 
was influencing her ? " In answer to this fun- 
damental question, the author states that Jeanne 
was acquainted with a prophecy that France 
" would be ruined by a woman and saved by a 
maiden"; she had also been told that the 
" Maiden Redeniptress should come from the 
border of Lorraine." And without further 
argument or evidence, the author concludes: 
"It is no longer possible to doubt that the 
prophecy thus revised is the work of an eccle- 
siastic whose intentions may be easily divined." 
After this remarkable feat of logic, one is sur- 
prised to learn that the author cannot name the 
priest in question ; but one among the suffering 
clergy of the Meuse valley " whose name will 
never be known, raised up an angelic deliverer 
for the king and the kingdom of France." 

And now comes Mr. Andrew Lang with the 
positive statement that " we have no evidence 
that she had heard of the Merlin prophecy till 
after she had announced her mission." 

In speaking of the Dauphin's kingship, the 
Maid stated that he should hold France as a fief 
(en^ commande) of the King of Heaven. This 
again is evidence to the author's mind of clerical 
prompting. But critics reply to this that the 
idea could have been gotten from sermons ; it 
was the current idea of the time among church- 
men. At first Jeanne announces a general 
mission, to save France ; later, it is to deliver 
Orleans. And with fine sarcasm the historian 
comments in this fashion : " We cannot fail to 
recognize the readiness and the tact with which 
the Voices altered their commands previously 
given according to the necessities of the moment." 
The same priestly influence M. France finds 
at work during those six long weeks at Poitiers, 
when the theologians were examining the Maid 
to make sure that she was not sent by the evil 
one. 

« But Jeanne before the doctors at Poitiers was an 
exception; she ran no risk of being suspected in mat- 
ters of faith. Even Brother Pierre Turelure himself 



had no desire to find in her one of those heretics he zeal- 
ously sought to discover at Toulouse. In her presence 
the illustrious masters drew in their theological claws. 
They were churchmen, but they were Armagnacs, for 
the most part business men, diplomatists, old councillors 
of the Dauphin. As priests doubtless they were pos- 
sessed of a certain body of dogma and morality, and of 
a code of rules for judging matters of faith. But now 
it was a question not of curing the disease of heresy, 
but of driving out the English." 

However, the farce served a purpose : it gave 
time for the Maid's fame to spread throughout 
the realm ; it familiarized the people of France 
with the thought that a miracle was to be per- 
formed on behalf of the miserable Dauphin ; it 
filled his partisans with hope, his enemies with 
fear. 

Of the Maid's actual achievements, M. France 
does not speak with much enthusiasm. He holds 
that the situation of the besiegers of Orleans was, 
if possible, worse than that of the besieged. All 
that was necessary to dislodge the English was 
a little confidence; and the Maid's reputed 
sanctity furnished that. The author criticizes 
her determination to go to Rheims rather than 
against Paris ; but " she did not know enough 
of the configuration of the country to decide 
such a question, and it is not likely that her 
saints and angels knew more of geography than 
she did." 

At the same time, the author denies that the 
Maid had any influence on the determination to 
go to Rheims. It was the Archbishop of 
Rheims, a " greedy, avaricious, unscrupulous " 
churchman, who insisted on the journey, and 
who carried the day. "Fifteen years had 
passed since his elevation to the archiepiscopal 
see of Rheims ; and of his enormous revenue he 
had not yet received one penny." Here we 
have the motive. So far as foot-notes show, 
this remarkable conclusion is based on no docu- 
mentary evidence, and is reached in the face of 
Dunois's testimony that " the Maid won all to 
her determined course." 

Of the great tragedy that followed the capture 
of the Maid, — the sale of the prisoner to the 

English, the two trials, and the execution, 

the author gives a circumstantial account of 
nearly two hundred pages. For the inactivity 
of King Charles and the ecclesiastics of his 
party he can give no reason, unless it be that 
doubts had arisen among the Armagnacs as to 
the sanctity of the Maid. Two chapters, deal- 
ing with various pretended Jeannes and the trial 
of rehabilitation (1455), bring the narrative to 
a close. Four brief appendices are added, of 
which only one — a letter from Dr. G. Dumas 



1910.] 



THE DIAIj

cautiously accepting the author's theory of hal- 
lucination and suggestion — is of any particular 
interest. 

Reviewers have charged M. France with 
almost every offense known to historical writ- 
ing: suppressing or misinterpreting evidence, 
substituting plausible theory for documentary 
statements, misquoting important testimony, and 
the rest. Those charges will have to be left, 
however, to scholars who have an intimate 
acquaintance with the field in question. But on 
one point even the lay reader may have a right 
to form an opinion. In all historical writing, 
the attitude that the author assumes toward his 
subject is of prime importance ; and in this par- 
ticular case the attitude and the view-point are 
readily determined. In his Introduction, M. 
France tells us that he has tried to look at 
events from the view-point of the century in 
which Jeanne lived ; and the earlier chapters 
give the impression that in this he has succeeded. 
But the reader soon discovers that his praise is 
insincere, that his purpose in describing pecul- 
iarities of fifteenth-century thought is not to 
instruct but to satirize, that of sympathy for his 
theme he has very little, and that he utterly fails 
to appreciate the importance of Jeanne's achieve- 
ments for the history of his country. 

In many respects the biography is a remark- 
able work. Of literary excellences it is need- 
less to speak ; it is written in the same elegant 
style that we know from the author's romances, 
though perhaps less vigorous, more controlled, 
and consequently more artificial. The general 
reader, as well as the student of history and of 
psychology, will find the volumes entertaining, 
suggestive, and thought-provoking. But it is 
not likely that the world will ever accept the 
picture of the young shepherdess that M. France 
has painted so skilfully as a faithful portrait of 
Jeanne d'Arc. Laurence M. Larson. 



Recent Poetry.* 



A timely word on the obsoleteness of war has been 
written by Mr. Norman Angell, an Englishman, in a 
book that he well names " Europe's Optical Elusion." 
In these days of " Dreadnaughts " and much talk about 
possible hostile invasions it is refreshing to chance 
upon a sensible and convincing presentation of the 
whole matter. So intricately interdependent, financially 
and industrially, are the nations of the world to-day 
that Mr. Angell pronounces war to be " intellectually 
obsolete." That it is also morally unthinkable, and in 
every way a most clumsy and unsatisfactory way to 
adjust international differences, no enlightened person 
can dispute. Warfare, whatever it was in Homer's 
time, is now a thing without glamour or poetic charm, 
and we are nearly all heartily ashamed of it as a glar- 
ing anachronism, an ungainly survival of a ruder age. 



An allegory of sacred and profane love is found 
in " A Vision of Life," by Mr. Darrell Figgis. The 
narrator suffers the temptation of St. Anthony, but 
is saved by " a voice of awful import " that arouses 
his higher self. Mr. Figgis is a metaphysical poet, 
as we may see from this example of his shorter 
pieces : 

" Each hath the Type of bliss within his thought 
That utters for him all his Life would be : 
The summit of his soul's felicity, 
The consummation wherein should be wrought 
In deft attainment all his spirit bought 
Awhile in fervent hope — whose roundest fee 
T was good to pay. 'T is so ; enough ! For me, 
Be it amiss or be it fitly sought, 
This would I crave — that mine and thy full soul 
May touch their mutual deep content, howe'er 
Life twists its tortuous course ; may still control 
Their Individuality, yet fare 
So subtly each on each, that as one whole 
They might stretch to their goal in God's pure air." 

This volume is favored by an introduction from 
the pen of Mr. Chesterton, who finds in the poet a 
reversion to the Elizabethan manner, and holds him 
a spiritual kinsman of the late Francis Thompson. 
He has "the same essential qualities of sustained 
and systematic metrical style, of line linked with 
line in a process requiring the reader's attention, 
and remote in its very nature from the startling 
simplicity of the old romantic ballad." All this may 
be allowed, and, indeed, appears clearly enough in 
our brief quotation. The critic goes on to say that 
" if this kind of poetry prevails, people will have to 
listen to it rather as they listen to good and rather 
difficult music, not as they listen to scattered bril- 
liancies in a speech by Mr. Bernard Shaw." Mr 
Figgis is, moreover, " on the side of the angels," 
and his work offers evidence of " a certain return 
to right feeling and faith in life, not as an early 
dream of transcendentalism, but as an ultimate 
result of experience."

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



Moreton Frewen may be fairly illustrated by the 
lyric, " Love Grown Cold." 

" Like a voice from the tomb that is dead, 
Like the light of a star that is old, 
Like a face in a dream that has long since fled 
Is love grown cold ; 

"The thoughts which I dared not think, 
The deeds that are past and done, 
Returning flock by memory's brink 
One by one. 

" Of the days that I loved you most, 
Of the days that you loved me best, 
Like the postern light of a ship at night 
We are dispossessed." 

A few of these pieces have African themes, and 
gain a touch of color thereby. Others are religious 
musings, and there is one rather pretty group of 
songs about birds. 

Mr. Christopher Stone publishes a little book 
called " Lusu8," which is a collection of brief and 
pointless prose sketches with verses intermingled. 
The verses are usually commonplace, but something 
a little more than that is offered by the lines entitled 
" The Idealist." 

" Somewhere beyond the ocean's melting rim, 
Beyond the level surface of the waves, 
He dreams of islands, in whose echoing caves 
Rest and eternal music wait for him. 
Behind, long billows seem to touch the brim 
Of low white cliffs, and looking back he craves 
To stand once more at his forefathers' graves, 
Hard by the cottage-door and garden trim. 
Too late he turns the prow ; through fretful spray 
The keel slips homeward, and the ominous roar 
Of tumbling surf is nearer, till once more 
Within the arms of his familiar bay 
He hears the village bell from far away, 
And lo ! fierce wreckers line the fatal shore." 

The " Odds and Ends " of Mr. R. Moutagu Tabor 
are parodies, exercises in classical and macaronic 
verse, political and social skits, and vers de societS 
of the sort made familiar by numerous exemplars. 
" A Dissolution of Partnership " is a neat and effec- 
tive example. 

" When you played at Bridge with me, 
When I saw you lightly make, 
As my smiling vis-a-vis, 

Every possible mistake, 
I forgave you, though I paid 
Dearly for the slips you made. 

" When you played at Golf with me, 

When your efforts made the ball 

Through the green or from the tee 

Into every bunker fall, 
I forgave you, though it cost 
Many a pang each time we lost. 

" When you played at Love with me, 
Ah ! what science then, what skill 

Drew me to your feet to be 
Now discarded at your will ; 

Shall I still forgive you ? Yes ! 

Nothing ever grieved me less." 

Mr. Tabor's touch as a parodist may be shown by a 

couple of brief examples. 

" The Trippers came down to the sea in their hordes, 
And their raiment was gorgeous with gewgaws and gauds, 
And their brass was as brazen, their manners as free, 
As when they lark nightly through Shoreditch, E. C." 



" What means this flimsy paper blue, 
With hints of all the ills I '11 rue 
Be my return not full and true? 
The Census. 

" What strikes me with profound dismay 
At what my maiden aunt will say 
When pressed to state her natal day ? 
The Census." 

A few more extracts would go far to prove that the 
author was in line to qualify for the laurels of C. S. C. 

In " The Rough Rider, and Other Poems," Mr. 
Bliss Carman's lyre is attuned to themes suggested 
by his adopted country. New England legends, 
Puritan ballads, tributes to our national heroes, and 
songs in commemoration of our national festivals, 
make up this pleasing little volume, and show the 
writer to have fairly earned citizenship with us. 
We are not quite sure that his description of " The 
Rough Rider " fits, but we cannot deny its writer's 
conviction. 

" Who is the hardy figure 
Of virile fighting strain, 
With valor and conviction 

In heart, and hand, and brain ? 
Sprung from our old ideals 
To serve our later needs, 
He is the modern Roundhead, 
The man who rides and reads." 

But we can accord him complete sympathy when he 
hymns " A New England Thanksgiving " in such 
strains as the following: 

" Here lived the men who gave us 

The purpose that holds fast, 
The dream that nerves endeavor, 

The glory that shall last. 
Here strong as pines in winter, 

And free as ripening corn, 
Our faith in fair ideals — 

Our fathers' faith — was born. 

M Here shone through simple living, 

With pride in word and deed, 
And consciences of granite, 

The old New England breed. 
With souls assayed by hardship, 

Illumined, self-possessed, 
Strongly they lived, and left us 

Their passion for the best." 

The note of social idealism is predominant in this 
new collection of verse, but the author still hears 
the call of the open road, and has lost nothing of 
his sensitive response to the ministries of nature. 

Last summer's celebration at Lake Champlain 
seems to have fared well at the hands of the poets. 
In our last article we quoted from Mr. Clinton 
Scollard's ode. Mr. Carman has a song upon this 
theme in the volume just discussed, and Mr. Percy 
Mackaye's " Ticonderoga " is given the precedence 
among his " Poems," recently published. It is a 
spirited composition, ending with these lines. 

"So by my visionary shore 
Soldier and saint and sagamore 
Live in my shadow evermore : 
Where, rapt in beauty, slopes Champlain, 
Lulled are the passion and the pain ; 
The vision and the race remain." 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

A group of other pieces written for occasions fol- 
lows, and their themes take a range wide enough to 
include Tennyson, the exploits of Mr. Wilbur 
Wright, the American University, the New Theatre 
of New York, and the death of Verestschagin. 
Then come the " Poems Lyrical and Descriptive " 
that fill the second half of the volume. We may 
allow the word " descriptive," but hardly the word 
••lyrical." The work is too jerky and prosaic to be 
called song. The following lines concerning Mr. 
Moody's dramatic success, offer a striking example 
of how not to write poetry. 

" Henceforth -we cannot be the same ; for us 
Americans, because of you, the tide 
Dramatic turns to seek its heritage 
Splendidly homeward to ourselves ; our stage 
Is cleft, between its pusillanimous 

And daring goals stands now the Great Divide." 

By way of contrast, and for the purpose of holding 
the scales even, we now give one of Mr. Mackaye's 
best poems, the sonnet to Norton's memory. 

" Out of the ' obscure wood ' and ominous way 
Which are our life, to that obscurer sea 
Whose margin glooms and gleams alternately 

With storm and splendor of the shrouded spray — 

He has departed. Our familiar day. 

His elm-hushed, ivied walks no more shall see 
That radiant smile of austere courtesy : 

On Shady Hill the mist hangs cold and gray. 

" He has departed hence, but not alone : 

Still in his steps, where golden discourse burns, 
To Virgil now he speaks, and now he turns 
Toward Alighieri in calm undertone, 

Holding with modest tact his path between 
The Mantuan and the mighty Florentine." 

Mr. John Myers O'Hara, who published some time 
ago a paraphrased version of Sappho, now gives us 
H Songs of the Open," a lyrical volume of his own. 
He has the true sense of the wild, and can be 
vividly picturesque upon occasion, as in " Night in 
the Woods." 

" The trees brood rigid and stark, 
Grey wolves in the brushwood bark ; 
A blast from the clearing sprays 
The snow in powdery haze. 

" The resinous pine boughs crack ; 
A wild-cat doubles its track, 
Slinks cowed from the campfire's flare 
O'er crusted slopes to its lair. 

'* The reach of the timber line 
Auroral flashes define ; 
And edged with a dagger light 
The pole-star pierces the night." 

Here is surely not a word to spare, and the scene is 
sharply etched. Nor is the reflective note lacking, 
for we find it in this "Silhouette" and in several 
other pieces. 

" Limned dark against the sinking disk of red. 
One lonely tree 
Lifts its lorn boughs in bare obliquity ; 

"Sad eremite whose arms despairing spread 
And agonize 
In dumb appeal to the responseless skies ; 



•• Old twisted fingers of fair seasons fled, 
Pointing in air 
Worn palms that plead in long unanswered prayer." 

Mr. O'Hara's measures are frequently too rugged 
to be purely lyrical, and he has a taste for forced 
adjectives that is a trifle jarring. One of his best 
lines' is spoiled by the word " seismic," which he 
evidently thinks should have three syllables. 

Mr. Robert Loveman's slender volume of lyrics 
is styled "The Blushful South and Hippocrene." 
There are three score and ten of them, save one, 
and all are simple and sincere. Our choice shall be 
the two stanzas called " Love." 

" We lack love ; if we have love 
We have all in all, 
Earth below and stars above, 
And calm and carnival. 

'• Love makes the ringed world ours, 
We are peers of God, 
Love woos and makes the flowers, 
Dew-drowsing 'neath the sod." 

Now and then these songs are freighted with the 
burden of the world's woe, but most of them are 
such airy and charming trifles as the one we have 
quoted. 

Art and nature, heroism and virtue, the delicate 
motions of the spirit touched by suggestions of the 
past, and the aspirations of the soul rapt by mystical 
intuitions — these are the chief notes of Miss Louise 
Imogen Guiney's song, now for nearly a quarter of 
a century escaping her to reach the public ear. She 
is one of the subtlest and most artistic of our lyrists, 
and many will be glad of the volume which she 
calls "Happy Ending" (may it be anything but an 
ending! ) into which she has brought "the less faulty 
half " of her previously published verse. Although 
the poems are not new, they shall here be illustrated 
by one brief example — this " Deo Optimo Maximo " 
which reveals the singer's deepest self. 

" All else for use. One only for desire ; 

Thanksgiving for the good, but thirst for Thee : 
Up from the best, whereof no man need tire, 
Impel Thou me. 

" Delight is menace if Thou brood not by, 

Power a quicksand, Fame a gathering jeer. 
Oft as the morn (though none of earth denv 
These three are dear), 

" Wash me of them, that I may be renewed, 
And wander free amid my freeborn joys : 
Oh, close my hand upon Beatitude ! 
Not on her toys." 

A rich freightage of both thought and emotion is 
borne with each new argosy launched by Miss Edith 
M. Thomas. The fleet has grown steadily in num- 
bers for thirty or more years, and its collected cargo 
is a possession that we would not willingly miss from 
our literature. " The Guest at the Gate " is the 
latest volume to bear the name of Miss Thomas, 
and from its varied contents — dramatic, gnomic, 
and lyric — we select this tender invocation to 
"Domiduca," the goddess who watches over the 
wanderer's homeward journeyings..

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



" Lead home, for now the light descends the skies ; 
Lead home, O goddess of the evening eyes — 

And voice of whisper dying off the leaves — 
And tonch of velvet air on flowers that sleep 

(To-morrow to he slain amid the sheaves) ! 
Lead home, brooder of the brooding bird, 

With wings bedewed, in grassy covert deep, 
Sleep-lulled, with its half -uttered vesper-notes; 

Lead home, guardian of the couching flock, 
By pools wherein the shadow lies unstirred ; 

Lead home the toilers all, who scarce can keep 
Their pathway for encumbering drowsiness ; 

Lead home, pilot of lonely skiffs that rock 
On yearning seas where bright the moon-path floats ; 

Lead all these home, and of thy bounty bless — 
Lead home ! 

" Lead home, O goddess of the evening eyes, 
And voice of dim response to twilight cries — 

Whom ever, since a child, I loved past all, 
Served past all deities befriending earth ! 

Lead home ! . . . And, if I have no home, then rise 
Before my way, and, with deceiving charms, 

Build me a dream of mine own roof and hearth, 
And thither in remembered accents call ; 

And lull me, sobbing, in remembered arms : 
Lead home ! " 

Mrs. Helen Huntington's volume of simple lyrics, 
" From the Cup of Silence, and Other Poems," may- 
be illustrated by quoting these stanzas " To Snow." 

" Strange divinity of snow, 
Eager other worlds to know, 
Spotless spirit, not of earth, 
What wild power invoked thy birth ? 



" All the stars to thee have told 
Raptures of eternal cold, 
All the silent, ice-bound streams 
Made thee keeper of their dreams. 

" Phantom victor over all, 
Robed in white, transplendent pall, 
Mighty in thy shining power, 
Dazzling vision of an hour, 

" None thy mystery may know 
As thou earnest thou must go, — 
Fading god, by earth outworn, 
Lo, in mist, to heaven upborne." 

They are pretty verses, if not deeply inspired. 

Something like this may also be said of the 
" Lyrics of Life," by Mrs. Florence Earle Coates. 
The idealism of this writer is fine and true, and she 
has an eye for themes that invite poetical treatment. 
Her best work is represented by such a poem as 
" The Christ of the Andes." 

" Far, far the mountain peak from me 
Where lone he stands, with look caressing ; 

Yet from the valley, wistfully 

I lift my dreaming eyes, and see 
His hand stretched forth in blessing. 

Never bird sings nor blossom blows 
Upon that summit chill and breathless, 

Where throned he waits amid the snows; 

But from his presence wide outflows 
Love that is warm and deathless. 

" symbol of the great release 
From war and strifes ! — unfailing fountain 
To which we turn for joy's increase 
Fain would we climb to heights of Peace — 
Thy peace upon the mountain ! " 

William Morton Payne. 



Briefs o^r New Books. 



Mr. Max Beerbohm, in an apprecia- 

a 'ZE&SL. tive es8a y on ". Whistler's Writing," 
offers an ingeniously impersonal plea 
for himself — for the artist who uses two mediums 
of expression but cannot get himself taken seriously 
in both of them. Mr. Beerbohm does not commit 
the unforgivable sin — in an essayist — of taking 
himself too seriously. He is entertained by himself, 
after the manner of his friend, Mr. Shaw; he exploits 
his own foibles, at times with almost Chestertonian 
ceremoniousness ; but he is essentially of neither 
Chesterton's nor Shaw's cult. As a caricaturist he is 
truly humorous ; as an essayist he knows how to trifle 
with life as genially as did Lamb and Stevenson, 
and far more compellingly than does his contem- 
porary, Mr. E. V. Lucas. The occasion of these 
remarks is the appearance of an American edition 
of "Yet Again " (John Lane), the fourth volume of 
Mr. Beerbohm's collected essays. Open fires, train- 
time goodbyes, the invisible President of the Swiss 
Republic, a sensible substitute for " rest-cures," the 
horrors of leader-writing, the tragic spoliation of a 
beautifully labelled hat-box, British humor, street- 
names, and the House of Commons manner, are 
some of the subjects on which Mr. Beerbohm, 
gravely, daintily, and wittily, frees his mind. Mr. 
Beerbohm is a bystander, an observer, endowed with 
the keenest possible sense of the art of life, but ami- 
ably detached from all its practical issues. He 
poses a little ; he deliberately cultivates interesting 
prejudices and significant predispositions. And 
whatever he chooses to talk about, in a style inti- 
mate, elaborate, quite sincere beneath its polish, 
takes on a new meaning — and keeps it. We shall 
never, we are sure, listen to a verger in Westmin- 
ster Abbey without remembering Mr. Beerbohm's 
vivid account of the poor man's slavery to sameness, 
and his apt suggestion that parrots, comfortably 
perched on each bust and statue, might easily be 
taught to relieve "these sad-faced men of their 
intolerable mission." When we see a friend off for 
a journey we shall recall the professional " seer-off " 
of the Anglo-American Social Bureau, and the read- 
ing of the editorials in the morning paper will be 
enlivened by the recollection of the " pathetic im- 
posture" involved, according to Mr. Beerbohm, in 
the effort to comment effectively, to order, at top 
speed, on the news of the day. 

Some early Schopenhauer's assertion that the 

appreciations number of years that elapse between 
of Meredith. ^ ne appearance of a book and its 
acknowledgment gives the measure of time that the 
author is in advance of his age, has given rise to 
much discussion apropos of the writings of Mr. 
George Meredith. Was Mr. James Thomson cor- 
rect in asserting that Henley's article on "The 
Egoist " (published in "The Athenaeum," 1879) was 
the first public utterance on Meredith " evincing 
the critic's familiarity with all the writer's works " ? 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



203 



According to Mr. Maurice Buxton Forman, Mr. 
Thomson was mistaken ; and, in order to give the 
student of Meredith an insight into the contemporary 
criticism of that author, he has chosen twenty-three 
articles representing critical judgment on Meredith 
from the year 1851, when his first book was pub- 
lished, till 1 883, when he issued his M Poems and 
Lyrics of the Joy of Earth." These articles ap- 
peared originally in English reviews — some anony- 
mously, and others over such signatures as William 
Michael Rossetti, Kingsley, Swinburne, Richard 
Garnet, George Eliot, Mark Pattison, "William 
Ernest Henley, and James Thomson. Mr. Thomson 
was perhaps, on the whole. Meredith's stanchest 
champion, admiring more unreservedly than the 
rest, and calling less attention to his " objectionable 
subtlety of style " and his u faults of construction." 
Mr. Swinburne's famous and poignant reply to 
" The Spectator's " review of " Modern Love " came 
out boldly with the announcement that " a more 
perfect piece of writing no man alive has ever 
turned out than the sonnet beginning "We saw 
the swallows gathering in the sky." George 
Eliot unhesitatingly pronounced "The Shaving of 
Shagpat " a work of genius. Mr. Henley com- 
pared Meredith to Shakespeare, in that he was 
" a man of genius who was a clever man as well." 
Meredith's writings were obviously not sensed by 
the many of his time, not even by the critics gener- 
ally ; but the foregoing examples show that he was 
appreciated by the few somewhat earlier than has 
been generally supposed. In Mr. Forman's col- 
lection of these u Early Appreciations of Meredith " 
(Scribner), there is much good reading for those 
who are curious about that great author. In many 
of them there is a combination of perceptiveness 
and lack of discrimination curious in itself. One 
might dispute even with Mr. Thomson (who says 
so many fine things) that Meredith is distinctly a 
man's writer. And why is there no mention of 
the Essay on Comedy? It appeared in 1877, but, 
up to 1883 had apparently provoked no comment 
worthy of repetition. It is interesting also to note 
that, although contemporary criticism of Meredith's 
novels and poems was in many respects radically 
different from that of to-day, the quotations from 
his writings in both cases are much the same. It 
would seem as if certain beautiful and pertinent 
passages had aroused from the beginning the intel- 
ligent reader's admiration. 

Professor J. Laurence Laughlin's 
volume on " Latter-day Problems " 
(Scribner) is a presentation of cer- 
tain social and economic questions in untechnical 
language, and is designed for popular reading. The 
material originally appeared, largely, in various 
magazines, and was then published by way of com- 
ment upon issues that are figuring in the political 
contests of the present day. The essays cover a 
wide range, including some primarily social or 
sociological matters, such as u Socialism, a Philoso- 



Yital problem*, 
economic and 
tociological. 



phy of Failure," "The Abolition of Poverty," 
" Social Settlements," and the like ; and also some 
strictly economic topics, such as " Guaranty of Bank 
Deposits," " Government vs. Bank Issues," and 
others of kindred character. Professor Laughlin's 
essays have the great merit of bringing to the solu- 
tion of current problems the results of analyses made 
by a clear and practical mind. They are conspicu- 
ously meritorious in that they nowhere fall into the 
common errors of sentimentalism or Utopian dream- 
ing. They have the additional and unusual virtue 
of conviction and of clearness in exposition. No 
one need be in doubt, after reading these chapters, 
either about the author's conclusions or the line of 
reasoning by which they have been arrived at. 
Professor Laughlin can never be charged with fall- 
ing between two stools. He is, throughout, con- 
sistent and determined in his adherence to a definite 
economic philosophy. A criticism which, however, 
will certainly be brought against bis discussion of 
those topics that have a larger social bearing is the 
apparent lack of sympathy, or allowance for differ- 
ences in points of view, in training, and in capacity. 
Many will perhaps feel that he has too positive a 
belief in the stability and permanence of the present 
economic order, or one closely similar to it; and 
that he lays too little stress upon the possibility of 
improvement as the result of combined social, rather 
than of individual, effort. K these criticisms are 
brought against this volume of essays, however, they 
must stand as an impeachment, not so much of the 
author's work, as of the school of thought to which 
he belongs. It is likely that the essays which will 
be most valued are those dealing with Banking and 
Currency questions, where the author speaks as our 
foremost academic specialist in such matters. The 
ideas he puts forward may well serve as an antidote 
to some of the dangerous schemes that have lately 
received sanction in high quarters. 

Actually to wander about the won- 
derful country lying around Rome 
is one of the most delightful of pos- 
sible experiences : to make the same trips through 
the pages of a book with Signor Rodolfo Lanciani as 
a guide is a pleasure scarcely less. In " Wander- 
ings in the Roman Campagna" (Houghton) Signor 
Lanciani, as in his previous books, shows himself a 
master of the art of arranging material which in 
other hands might be dull, so that, for the time 
being, we all become archaeologists and share his 
enthusiasm in all his " finds." The most charac- 
teristic features of the Campagna landscape, as we 
see it to-day, are the remains of aqueducts and 
reservoirs stretching over the crumpled plains and 
ruins of tombs lining the roadsides. In this book 
we are taken back to the happy days when the 
Campagna resembled a great park, studded with 
villages, farms, cottages, lordly residences, temples, 
fountains, and tombs ; when these tombs contained 
not only a funeral banquet ing-hall level with the 
road, but also a crypt below, where the ashes were

kept in urns or the bodies were laid to rest in sar- 
cophagi. How these changes came about, and how 
new discoveries underground are still being made, 
is an interesting story. Indeed, the last three years 
seem to have been notably marked by eventful revel- 
ations, — for example, the beautiful bas-relief of 
Antinous at Torre del Padiglione, with the name of 
its sculptor carved upon it (October, 1907 ) ; the 
sarcophagus, a masterpiece of Hadrian's golden age, 
found by the workmen digging ground for the new 
freight station at Rome (June, 1908) ; the interest- 
ing triangular altar on the Janiculum, only a year 
ago. Most important of all, perhaps, are the things 
brought to light near the King's hunting-box at 
Castel Porziano : a Roman cottage on the coast of 
Laurentum, and a copy of Myron's statue of the 
Disk-thrower — " Queen Elena's Cottage " and 
" Queen Elena's Discobolus," as they will hereafter 
be known. Three out of the six chapters of the 
present book have headings of tempting literary 
sound — " The Land of Horace." " The Land of 
Cicero," " The Land of Pliny the Younger." These 
regions, so lovely in themselves, are somewhat lack- 
ing in absolute landmarks of the homes and lives 
of the great writers. But even if no exact bounda- 
ries can be traced of the Sabine farm, it is certain 
that we can recognize the streams and hills and 
fields that Horace loved so well ; that we can wan- 
der along the same Via Valeria which the poet loved 
to pace in the early morning hours, on his way to 
the villa of Maecenas. " As a bee darts from the 
fields of Matinum where the redolent thyme grows, 
so I follow the banks of the Anio to feel the inspira- 
tion of the Muses." The volume is published in 
the same sumptuous style of its five predecessors on 
Roman themes. There are maps and illustrations 
abundant in quantity and charming in quality ; 
many are of full-page, and many entirely new. It 
is to be hoped that the author will keep his half- 
promise for a second volume of these charming 
" Wanderings." 

»„„;, .,„„* When a book is written by a distin- 

Sack-yard J 

studies of guished r renchman, translated by a 

the stars. competent Englishman, and mar- 

keted in this country by an American publishing- 
house, one naturally expects to find some merit in 
it. Such a book is Rudeaux's " How to Study the 
Stars" (Stokes). To be sure, the author's name is 
spelt in one way on the cover, and in another on 
the title-page ; and the translator on rare occasions 
seems to miss the author's meaning, as in the sen- 
tence, " But these remarks have mainly a theoretical 
value, since their effect is usually realized in that 
portion of the plate which is rendered useless by 
the least instrumental distinctness" (pp. 325-6). 
However, a very few blemishes of this sort are 
simply the flies in the ointment ; the ointment itself 
is very attractive. It is not too much to say that 
this is the best book in the English language in its 
particular field. Its aim is to teach and direct those 
who wish to make observations of celestial objects 



with small telescopes and home-made appliances, as 
well as to indulge in celestial photography. The 
author has evidently had abundant experience of 
this soi't, and gives his directions with commendable 
explicitness and charming na'ivetS. In the first 
third of the book he gives descriptions of methods 
by which as amateur, having purchased his lenses, 
may make his own telescope or celestial camera, if 
he be so minded ; he also provides for the needs of 
one who purchases a ready-made small telescope, 
and wishes to gain a thorough insight into its con- 
struction. Besides this, good advice is given about 
the construction of an inexpensive observatory. The 
remainder of the book is devoted to minute and care- 
ful instructions about how to make observations or 
photographs of the different sorts of objects which 
one finds in the sky. Here the author's experience 
in such work stands out very plainly, and enables him 
to give directions at once detailed, sound, and helpful. 
There are seventy-nine illustrations, many of which 
are from the author's own observations and photo- 
graphs ; they well demonstrate the excellent results 
which follow the skilful manipulation of small in- 
struments. While very few persons in this country 
have telescopes in their back-yards, as Professor 
Hale and Mr. Burnham have had with such happy 
results, those who are so equipped will find their 
interest heightened and their work rendered more 
effective by reading M. Rudeaux's work. 

London Town, B y ron has written of London as « a 
from King Lud new land which foreigners can never 
to Queen " Vic" understand." As an aid, however, 
to its fuller comprehension we may recommend 
Mr. Arthur Compton-Rickett's well-conceived and 
carefully-executed work, " The London Life of 
Yesterday" (Dutton). In thirteen erudite but not 
unreadable chapters are presented the general aspect 
and bearing of the city at various periods, from the 
time of King Lud to the reign of Queen Victoria. 
First we have " London in the Making," then the 
London of Alfred's day, after that, successively, the 
London of the twelfth century, of Chaucer's time, 
under Whittington's magistracy, in the Renaissance, 
during the Reformation, as Shakespeare saw it, as 
Milton and Cromwell knew it, as gossipy Pepys has 
pictured it, and as Christopher Wren rebuilt it, — 
the London of Addison and Pope, of Johnson and 
Hogarth, and, finally, of Francis Place and Charles 
Dickens. An appended bibliography of seven pages 
gives the contemporary and more recent sources of 
information drawn upon by the author, who has 
done well to dwell less on the physical features of 
the great city than on its manners and customs, its 
interests and aims, and its progress toward a higher 
civilization. Strange and almost incomprehensible 
to us are the formal strained relations between 
sixteenth-century and seventeenth-century English 
children and their parents. " Beating was quite 
common for both girls and boys on the slightest 
provocation ; the whole duty of motherhood was to 
marry the girls, willy-nilly, at the first suitable

opportunity." As for the boys, some of them were 
mercilessly gorged with learning at a very tender 
age. Locke speaks of one who began Latin at six, 
understood ''geography and chronology and the 
Copernican system of our vortex " at nine, and had 
some acquaintance with anatomy. The author mod- 
estly tells in his preface what he has M tried to essay " 
in the subsequent chapters ; but his book is by no 
means so feebly tentative as that peculiar phrase 
might lead one to expect. 

_ .„ , It is pleasant to note that the recent 

The life of an r 

old-fathioned M Life of Susan Warner is pub- 
gentieuoman. Kshed by the same firm (now G. P. 
Putnam's Sons) that nearly sixty years ago brought 
out •' The Wide Wide World." It is as the author 
of this, her first novel, published in 1850, that Susan 
Warner is chiefly remembered. The book, a relig- 
ious romance, was very widely read in England and 
France, as well as at home ; and many of us can 
remember with what absorption we followed the 
fortunes of poor little Ellen Montgomery. Nowa- 
days the religious emotion of the story seems exag- 
gerated, almost morbid ; but it was, after all, an 
entirely natural expression of the fife of the author. 
Susan Warner lived in a time when babies were 
born middle-aged, — so perhaps it is not strange 
that at thirty-one she should have written a story 
whose heroine possessed an over-developed con- 
science. The wonder is that, in spite of this, her 
book was full of genuine human interest, and so 
escaped sentimentality. It seems an ungracious 
task to pick flaws in a work so evidently a labor of 
love as this biography. The author, Anna B. 
Warner, says in her preface : " I have tried to put 
in nothing irrelevant, but with everything so inter- 
esting to me it was often hard to choose." This we 
can well believe ; and to a woman now past eighty, 
writing of an adored sister, we must pardon the 
gentle garrulity of age. The pages are full of de- 
tails, interesting only to one with a background of 
intimate personal knowledge and affection. The 
letters and extracts from journals are linked by 
comment sadly lacking in clearness and coherence. 
For the most part the letters are undated, and the 
sequence of events can only be guessed. Never- 
theless the book gives an interesting picture of life 
in and about New York in the forties and fifties; 
also a genuine portrait of a gentlewoman, by nature 
eager, sensitive, and studious, who was always, in 
spite of Puritan influences, a devout worshipper of 

Beauty. 

If France is a decadent nation, there

terest in her doings, past or present- 
English and American publishers, not content with 
the flood of volumes in English which treat French 
subjects, are finding readers for translations of the 
most ordinary French originals. Mrs. Rodolph 
Stawell has made a most excellent version of a 
monograph by Gilbert Stenger, entitled "The Re- 
turn of Louis XVIII." (Scribner). There is little 



reason for saying much of the original, whether in 
praise or in blame. Half the clever Frenchmen of 
this generation seem to be playwrights, and the other 
half historians : and this volume is a very creditable 
bit of work from the shop of an artisan of the latter- 
named guild. The most striking feature of the au- 
thor's method is his fondness for " portraits " of the 
old classic variety ; and a remarkable evidence of his 
conscientiousness is his desperate effort to be just to 
the English. His first chapter has a lucid state- 
ment of the relationships subsisting between all the 
leading members of the Bourbon family at the time 
of the Restoration. There is a good index, and an 
extensive table of contents which is in itself a com- 
plete and detailed account of the events of the period. 
An appendix, in the form of an extract from the 
Almanach Royal of 1815, gives the King's house- 
hold in full — Grand Almoner, Confessor, Chief 
Pantler, Chief Cupbearer, and the rest — sixty-nine 
persons in all ; with the household of Monsieur, the 
Comte d'Artois, who later became Charles X., 
the second list comprising thirty-one names. The 
translator deserves special mention. She has not 
only given us a well-written version of the French 
text, — she has furnished in the footnotes correc- 
tions of errors and explanations of obscurities which 
prove her capable of writing, if she chose, quite as 
good a history of Louis XVIII. as the one she has 
translated. 

Though Major De Bouillane de 

^SS«.» I *«« to, « - . Aronnd Afghanistan" 
(Appleton) is a personal account of 
the author's trip from Teheran to the Chinese frontier, 
thence through Little Tibet and Kashmere, and across 
the Baluchistan desert back to the beginning of the 
loop, it is nevertheless an important addition to our 
knowledge of the " buffer state." Trained students 
of Eastern affairs are so confident that a telling 
conflict between Russia and England must arise for 
the superior hand over this land, that any book 
is welcome which adds its mite toward a true 
understanding of the confused and contradictory 
state of affairs now existing under the unsteady 
ruler of that country. Major de Lacoste travelled 
round Afghanistan, peeping, as it were, over the walls, 
but the direction and purpose of his peepings are 
heralded in a preface by M. Georges Leygues, who, 
quite naturally, takes a pro-Franco-Russo view of 
affairs by insisting that Lord Curzon and the high 
Indian officials made many sad mistakes during the 
Japanese-Russian war, and that every mistake stirred 
up not only the Indian- Afghan problem but also 
the whole Asiatic problem. Very naturally, too, 
M. Leygues is of the opinion that all the Western 
nations are forced to take a stand on the question, 
and then — the world conflict. Of this serious 
matter there is only a slight echo in the body of this 
book ; rather, Major de Lacoste gives us an intelli- 
gent and entertaining account of the people, their 
manners and their country. The illustrations are 
unusual and instructive. 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



L ., , . . The Rev. John White said that a 

of Quantreii, large part of the first settlers of 
the guerrilla. Massachusetts Bay were "rude, un- 
governable persons, the very scum of the land." Such 
is always the case in new settlements ; and it was es- 
pecially true of the western frontier at the time of the 
Civil War. The worst of the " scum " was Quantreii, 
whose life has recently been written by Mr. William 
Elsey Connelley (Torch Press, Cedar Rapids, la.). 
Mr. Connelley originally acquired a collection of 
Quantreii papers, made by the late W. W. Scott, 
who was a newspaper editor at Canal Dover, Ohio, 
and an early friend of the Quantreii family. These 
papers he has supplemented by indefatigable re- 
search, and by conversation with persons who knew 
Quantreii at every stage of his career. The result 
he has somewhat loosely put together in a large 
book, which gives the life-history of the notorious 
guerrilla in great detail. So many contradictory 
statements have been made about Quantreii that it 
is well the work should be done. The book throws 
a lurid light upon conditions in Missouri at the 
time, and adds a chapter to the psychology of the 
degenerate. It strips Quantreii of the glamour that 
has sometimes attached to his name, and shows how 
inevitably in real life the wages of sin is death. 



Notes. 



Mr. Arthur Rackkam has selected Wagner's " Ring " 
as the subject for his next illustrative work. 

The authorized English translation of M. Edmond 
Rostand's new drama, " Chanticleer," will be issued in 
this country by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 

A set of Dickens's works, in thirty volumes, will be 
added this spring by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. to 
their attractive series of standard authors in complete 
editions. 

George Meredith's last novel, "Celt and Saxon," 
now appearing serially in an English periodical, will 
be published during the coming summer by Messrs. 
Scribner's Sons. 

Two new volumes will be added this spring to Messrs. 
Holt's " Leading Americans " series. These are " Lead- 
ing American Novelists " by Mr. John Erskine ; and 
" Leading American Essayists " by Mr. William Morton 
Payne. 

A Nature-book of an unusual sort is promised in 
Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd's " A Cycle of Sunsets," soon 
to be issued by Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. It is a 
sympathetic study of sunsets, interwoven with a pleasant 
little love-story. 

Mr. O. C. Auringer, author of several volumes of 
verse, is about to issue a volume of twin tragedies of 
the Revolution, entitled " The Death of Maid McCrea, 
and the Lover's Tragedy." Messrs. Badger & Co., 
Boston, are the publishers. 

Two volumes are devoted to " The Great English 
Short-Story Writers " in " The Reader's Library " 
(Harper), edited by Messrs. W. J. and C. W. Dawson. 
Thirteen examples are given in each volume, half of 
the number being of American origin. The second 



volume is supposed to be more " modern " than the 
first, but there is not much chronological difference 
between Stevenson, Mr. James, and Mr. Hardy, on the 
one hand, and Dr. Doyle, Sir. Gilbert Parker, and Mrs. 
Deland, on the other. 

A study of Maurice Maeterlinck, by Gerard Harry, 
translated by Mr. A. R. Allinson, including two essays 
by Maeterlinck hitherto unpublished in English, is 
announced. The book will have a photogravure por- 
trait of Maeterlinck, and other illustrations. 

Recently at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, a new play 
in ballad metre, by Mr. W. B. Yeats, "The Green 
Helmet," was produced by the National Theatre Com- 
pany. The play is founded on a folk-tale of the Cuchu- 
lain cycle, and Mr. Yeats's experiment in the use of 
ballad metre is completely successful. 

Three new volumes in the " Library of Living 
Thought," published by the Messrs. Harper, are the 
following: " Roman Law in Mediaeval Europe," by 
Prof. Paul Vinogradoff; "Crete the Foreruimer of 
Greece," by C. H. Hawes and Miss Harriet B. Hawes; 
and " Diamonds," by Sir William Crookes. 

It is announced that with the April issue " Putnam's 
Magazine " will suspend publication, its subscription 
list having been transferred to the " Atlantic Monthly." 
" Putnam's " was conducted in a dignified manner, 
without resort to sensationalism in matter or methods ; 
and we regret to hear of its disappearance from the 
magazine field. 

The English "Who's Who" (Macmillan) grows 
thicker and thicker. The volume for 1910 fills about 
twenty-two hundred pages, and contains several hun- 
dreds of new names, while of the old ones " few die 
and none resign," to quote Jefferson on office-holders. 
The selection of American names seems to be as 
capricious as ever. 

The prize of fifteen hundred dollars offered by the 
governors of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 
Stratford-upon-Avon for the best play has been won by 
Miss Josephine Preston Peabody with " The Piper." 
Three hundred and fifteen plays were submitted in the 
competition. The successful work will be produced in 
the Memorial Theatre. 

Two interesting titles are announced for spring pub- 
lication in Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company's River- 
side Press Editions. One of these is a reprint of " Pan's 
Pipes," among the most charming of Robert Louis 
Stevenson's essays ; the other is entitled " A Poet in 
Exile," and consists of some early letters written by 
John Hay to his friend Miss Nora Perry, now issued 
under the editorship of Miss Caroline Ticknor. 

The Yale University Press announces that it will 
publish during the autumn of this year, " The Records 
of the Federal Convention of 1787," under the editor- 
ship of Prof. Farrand, of the Department of History at 
Yale University. Until now the printed records have 
been scattered through a dozen or more different works, 
and there has been some unpublished material of con- 
siderable value. Evident need has thus existed for this 
new and complete edition, which brings together, in 
a single work, all of these scattered records. It is 
expected that the exhaustive search made by Professor 
Farrand will result in the present work's proving to be a 
definitive edition of the " Records of the Federal Con- 
vention of 1787." The records will appear in three 
royal octavo volumes, with a special limited subscribers' 
edition on English hand-made paper.

QUALITY

QUANTITY 



A MONG other sensible remarks, a 

^* writer in "The American Printer" 

had this to say recently : 

• " A short time ago I read the claims of a 
newspaper business manager who was talking big 
circulation. He claimed that a man out shooting 
ducks would stand a better chance of success by 
firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock. 
And so he would if they were all ducks. But if 
ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and 
gulls, and crows, and herons, he would do better 
if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock. 
Circulation does n't mean much. It 's the canvas- 
backs in the flock that count, — in other words, 
financial standing and probable interest of audience 
that the book publisher must consider. What 's 
the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five 
hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of 
that number didn't know there was that much 
money in the world, and would n't spend it for 
books if they had it to spare ? " 



I N ADVERTISING in The Dial the 
publisher wastes no ammunition, — 
every bird in the flock is a canvas- 
back. The Dial is devoted exclusively 
to books — its readers are exclusively 
buyers of books. Several thousand 
well-to-do people — private readers, 
librarians, booksellers — read The Dial 
regularly, and depend wholly upon its 
guidance in making book purchases. 



'T'HESE people, the cream of the 
American book-buying public, can 
be reached only through The Dial.

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob-

contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, $0 cents, postpaid.

NOW READY 



Mr. Winston Churchill's 
! A Modern Chronicle 



By the author of " Richard Carvel," 
"The Crisis," " Coniston," etc. 

Cloth, illustrated, $1.^0. 



The book is a section of genuine American 
life in which politics, love, and business are all 
living forces. It is big and broad and exceedingly interesting. 




Mrs. Atherton's Tower of Ivory 

The critics are calling it u the strongest and most vitally dramatic story she has ever 
written." The power of the book lies in its dominating figure, formidable in the 
bitterness of her knowledge of life, beautiful in a certain spiritual exaltation. As a story 
of "the love of a real man and a great woman told as no other Anglo-Saxon living could 
tell it," says one critic "its realizations of character are masterly." Cloth. $1.50 

Mrs. Voynich's An Interrupted Friendship 

An extraordinary character in the very real world of fietion is Mrs. Voynich's " Gadfly " 
who from the moment he drifts into this story holds the reader so subtly and strongly. 
There is no more tragic figure in life itself than this betrayed, unbelieving devotee to 
liberty. The contrast of his inner atmosphere and that of the French country chateau 
which serves as a background to the story is drawn with the skill and delicacy, the 
exquisite sense of fine feeling and of subtle emotion of which Mrs. Voynich is so 
completely mistress. Cloth. $1.50 



Mrs. Watts's Nathan Burke 



The sunny, fruitful Ohio valley is the scene of this leisurely, enjoyable story in which 
the hero while changing from Backwoods Nathan into General Burke grows firmly into 
the reader's friendship. It is such a book as takes one out of oneself, not violently but 
by spreading before one the life of a community of people one is glad to know and to 



live among.

THE BANKRUPTCY OF LITERATURE. 



" What would happen," asks M. Andre 
Beaunier in a recent review, "if all the cus- 
tomers of all the bakers should set about baking 
bread themselves?" It is hardly necessary to 
reply that the bakers would go into bankruptcy. 
This quaint reflection comes from a dismayed 
observer of the plethora of modern books, more 
solicitous, perhaps, than he need be concerning 
the welfare of their writers. More fitly than in 
most cases, the plea of this class that they must 
live may be given the answer of the familiar 
anecdote. What is the necessity, indeed, for 
this continued activity in a world that groans 
beneath the burden of their literary production, 
a world upon which they wantonly bestow so 
questionable a gift? The eminent critic who, 
a few years ago, in a petulant mood declared 
science to be bankrupt, might with greater 
justice have sought to establish a case for the 
bankruptcy of literature. 

If bankruptcy be the failure to meet just 
obligations, there is a good deal to be said for 
the view that modern literature is dangerously 
close to the insolvent state. When financial 
disaster of this sort is near, its proximity is 
usually indicated by a frantic straining for the 
extension of credit. Every manner of make- 
shift is resorted to for the purpose of staving 
off the crisis and regaining the prestige that is 
on the point of irrecoverable loss. No terms 
could more exactly describe the devices by which 
a large proportion of our modern writers seek 
to relieve a situation which they feel to be des- 
perate ; no metaphor more exactly fits their case 
than that of a credit strained almost to the 
breaking-point. No other explanation can ac- 
count with any degree of satisfaction for the 
fashion in which their vocabularies are tricked 
out with technicalities and neologisms, for the 
reckless way in which they riot in the bizarre 
and the paradoxical, for the intellectual and 
ethical audacities in which they indulge. To 
achieve novelty at whatever cost is the sum of 
their ambition, for thus alone is their poverty- 
stricken estate to be for a time concealed. If 
they can make themselves sufficiently startling, 
they may hope to seem impressive. That the 
hope is not altogether futile may be gathered 
from a glance at the vogue of such men as 



228 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



Nietzsche and Gorky and d' Annunzio and Whit- 
man and Chesterton and Shaw. It may also 
be gathered from a study of many of the rep- 
utations that have recently been made in the 
domain of philosophical speculation, and in the 
futile fields of pedagogical and sociological and 
psychical theory. 

Neither these men nor these opinions are to be 
ignored, for they obtrude themselves too promi- 
nently into the foreground of contemporary 
thought. Nor do they deserve to be wholly 
disregarded ; because, apart from their symp- 
tomatic significance, they embody a real stirring 
of the waters which they make so turbid. But 
by just so far as they depart from normal forms 
of expression and normal modes of thought they 
become objects of rightful suspicion, and the 
more startling the departure the greater the 
probability that they are offering mere irrational 
vagary as a substitute for orderly cerebration. 
It amounts to a practical confession of judg- 
ment in the bankruptcy court for a writer to 
offer for his stock in trade such unrealizable 
assets as the " precious " vocabulary and the 
unfettered period, such evidences of intellectual 
ineptitude as glaring paradox and unrestrained 
sensibility. These ways of doing a literary 
business may be defended by fine-sounding 
phrases — " enriching the language," " increas- 
ing the flexibility of utterance," "liberating 
the spirit from tradition," and " unsealing the 
springs of sympathy," — but the argument 
rings hollow. Neither the substance of thought 
nor the form which it contrives for its expres- 
sive service is as wholly a matter of fashion as 
our modern sophists would have us believe ; the 
human spirit has accumulated a certain amount 
of fixed capital in fairly permanent embodiment 
during its three thousand years, more or less, 
of unwearying effort. 

The trouble seems to be that our modern 
speculative fever has got into literature and 
other places where it does not belong, and the 
methods of " frenzied finance " are found profit- 
able (for the time being) by many of our poets 
and novelists and dramatic purveyors, even by 
our educators and sociologists and philosophers. 
So we have " booms " in such specialties as 
rhapsodical prose and degraded speech and the 
exploitation of sensual situations, in such revolts 
(sometimes revolting enough) as march under 
the red banners of new thought and free love 
and pragmatism. We are terrorized by educa- 
tional ideals that take small account of the soul, 
and social ideals that would overthrow the very 
citadel of individualism, and political ideals that 



are subversive of most old-fashioned notions 
about the sanctity of human rights. All these 
are perhaps passing phenomena, but they press 
upon our attention to somewhat trying effect, 
and the whole wildcat movement is pretty dis- 
couraging to those who know enough of history 
to understand the value of credit and stability 
in the operations of the intellectual market. 

The case of literature, while by no means 
hopeless, is far more serious than the case of 
science, as the latter is viewed through the 
spectacles of prejudice by M. Brunetiere. The 
recent progress of science is marked by really 
definite and brilliant achievements, and its out- 
look was never more promising. But literature, 
if not on the verge of bankruptcy, is at least 
threatened by an impairment of credit for which 
the natural remedy would be a drastic overhaul- 
ing of its securities and a general retrenchment 
in most directions. There are no evident signs 
that this remedy is likely to be applied. The 
number of people who write flimsy novels and 
perpetrate bad poems and bad plays goes on 
steadily increasing, and the number of editors 
and publishers who encourage these misguided 
persons seems to grow at nearly the same rate. 
Then in addition to all this legitimate if ill- 
advised competition on either side, there is the 
disturbing element supplied by the host of aspi- 
rants for literary fame who are so assured of 
their own merits that no rejection deters them, 
and who print at their own expense the immortal 
works that can find no one else to stake money 
upon their success. Clearly, the threatening 
debacle will not be averted by a sudden growth 
of self-restraint. 

During the last half-century the world has 
passed through one of the golden ages of litera- 
ture ; but the age in which we now live is at 
best one of silver, if not one of lead or plated 
metal. The most enthusiastic spokesman of 
modernity would not claim for the best score 
of living writers anything like a parity of im- 
portance with the best score of those whose 
deaths we have been called upon to chronicle 
with such painful frequency since 1880. We 
welcome new writers like Mr. De Morgan and 
Mr. Bennett and Mr. Stephen Phillips and Mr. 
Alfred Noyes, but the best we can say of them 
is that they reflect something of the glory of 
their great predecessors and exemplars. And 
those who do not thus shine by a borrowed light 
are pretty apt to force themselves upon our 
attention by their shrill or falsetto voices, and 
by their bad literary manners, rather than by 
any display of the literary graces. " Politics

and private avarice make the air we breathe 
thick and fat," said Emerson in 1837 ; and it 
would not be a bad diagnosis of our present 
condition. Both of the de-spiritualizing influ- 
ences that he then named are now even more 
active among men the world over, and they 
make themselves felt in literature as in every 
other really vital human concern. And the 
many disillusionments that the later years have 
brought us have in some measure choked the 
springs of hope that sustained the faith of our 
forefathers a century ago. 



BERNARD SHA W IN FRANCE. 



Although the name of Bernard Shaw is, in a 
popular sense, all but unknown in France, — less 
known, indeed, than it is in America, and according 
to accounts than it is in Germany and Austria, — 
yet his work has been examined with great thorough- 
ness by the students and critics who have interested 
themselves in it, with the result that their comments 
are notably free from traces of that idle chatter 
which has been a dominating element in his recep- 
tion elsewhere. The Shaw movement, as it may 
now be called, seems to be confined to university 
consideration on the one hand, and to the discussion 
arising from the production of one of the plays in 
Paris on the other. Last winter no less than four 
Shaw courses were given to university audiences — 
at the Sorbonne, at Brussels, at Bordeaux, and at 
Geneva. Considering the fact that it is less than 
four years since the first extended article on Shaw 
appeared in a French review, the assumption may 
be made of a genuine extension of interest. 

The author of the article referred to was M. Jean 
Blum, a native of Paris, who has been a professor 
of German at Turcoing and at Oran, and is also 
interested in contemporary English letters. He 
modestly admits that he could not literally have 
been the first to introduce Shaw to his countrymen, 
as several notices had appeared in print previously, 
some of them as early as 1897 or 1898. Neverthe- 
less, to M. Blum beyond doubt is due the credit of 
being the first to write on Shaw at length, at first 
hand, and quite independently of his reception in 
England. It may safely be said that such an intro- 
duction has had not a little to do with keeping the 
Shaw movement free from the absurdities of fad- 
dism ; for M. Blum's presentation, instead of being 
indiscriminately eulogistic, was thoughtful and mod- 
erate. 

The man who has written and spoken most on 
Shaw in France, and the one most widely known as 
his expounder, is M. Augustin Hamon, who with 
his wife has recently completed the authorized 
French version of Shaw's works. M. Hamon, when 
asked by the author to undertake the translation of 
his entire work, accepted for the socialistic and poli- 



tical tracts, but not for the plays, regretting that as 
he himself was not a dramatist he did not feel quali- 
fied for the task. Shaw would not accept the excuse, 
writing : " I know well what I am doing. The 
vivacity of certain accounts of yours of Socialistic 
Congresses has convinced me that you are the man 
to write a French version of my comedies. You 
know modern society and human nature, and that is 
the important part in the work which I ask you to 
undertake." 

The translator was a Paris student, and is now a 
Brussels Professor. He is a copious writer, and a 
contributor to influential periodicals in half a dozen 
countries. The drift of his mind may be inferred 
from the titles of his books. He joins hands with 
Shaw in anti-militarism ; and his work on " The 
Psychology of the Professional Soldier" got him 
into serious trouble. It is said that because of this 
book, and after the affair of the anarchists Henry and 
Caserio, the author left France for some months, 
for England, where he contributed to the " Free 
Review " and " Liberty," and wrote " The Psychol- 
ogy of the Socialistic Anarchist." With such a 
record, it is perhaps less strange that M. Hamon 
should find in Shaw one who shares his views than 
that he should see anything else in him. M. Hamon 
seems, in fact, to be the only French critic of Shaw 
who is a socialist, or who has been drawn to Shaw 
by this bond of sympathy. He is the most zealous, 
the most enthusiastic, the most eulogistic Shawite in 
France. He regards Shaw's works as the dramatic 
expression of ideas which he himself had expounded 
in pamphlets and on the platform. M. Hamon de- 
livered a series of lectures on Shaw at the Sorbonne 
the past winter, and their success is shown by the 
recent announcement of a second series for the 
current session. 

M. Charles Cestre, formerly of Dijon and of 
Lyons, and recently appointed professor of English 
in the University of Bordeaux, delivered there a 
series on Shaw, which was better attended than lec- 
tures of like character have been for years. The 
publication of these lectures is called for ; and it is 
probable that M. Cestre (who is a Harvard A.M.) will 
be his own translator into English. M. Cestre's pre- 
vious books, dealing with French ideas of social democ- 
racy as they affected England at the time of the Revo- 
lution, have qualified him peculiarly for a discussion 
of this exponent of the modern spirit. The fact that 
the Bordeaux professor is not a socialist, and that, 
while sympathetic, his approval and admiration are 
qualified, enhances the value of his work, and at the 
same time shows the rational character of the Shaw 
movement. 

M. Henri Odier, a graduate of the University of 
Berne, with a thesis on the psychology of words 
and a work in prospect on Hawthorne, lately gave a 
short series of lectures on Shaw at the Athe'ne'e of 
Geneva; and these lectures are now in press. M. 
Palante, professor of philosophy at St. Brieuc, has 
also lectured on the same subject ; and Shaw has 
been commented upon in the periodicals by such 



230

[April 1, 



men as MM. Henri de Re'gnier, Adolphe Brisson, 
Henri Bidou, Firmin Roz, Ernest Charles, Gaston 
Rageot, Regis Michaud, Raymond Recouly, and 
others. Only those writers who are taken seri- 
ously have the sources of their ideas investigated; 
and there has hardly been a French reviewer who 
has not suggested a philosopher or dramatist as a 
test of comparison with Shaw. That the names thus 
brought out are so often the same shows at least the 
existence of a standard. One critic, M. Michaud, 
says that, as a revolutionary, Shaw is to be thought 
of with Byron, Shelley, Ruskin, and Morris ; and he 
is credited with familiarity with Darwin, Spencer, 
and Schopenhauer. In the apology of faith versus 
works, of spontaneity and sincerity against the 
formalism of institutions, of individuality against 
appearances, M. Roz finds signs of Shaw's ideals in 
Bunyan's great allegory. But the two names invari- 
ably brought forward in the longer reviews are Ibsen 
and Nietzsche, — and this in spite of Shaw's retort 
to his English reviewers regarding his debt to 
Charles Lever, Samuel Butler, and others still less 
known. Ibsen held that our modern conception of 
virtue holds us in real slavery. The quintessence 
of Ibsenism, according to Shaw, is in the destruction 
of this conception, of this ideal; this, according to 
M. Blum, is the bond between the two, the founda- 
tion on which Shaw builds his philosophy. M. 
Rageot notes that Shaw's mission is comparable to 
that of Ibsen, as shown in their fondness for moral 
problems and in their treatment of anguish of con- 
science. On the dramatic side as well, Shaw is said 
to have learned from the Norwegian the art of joining 
exposition to action. Points of dissimilarity, on the 
other hand, are not wanting. Chief of these is that 
Shaw is essentially comic, while Ibsen is mainly 
tragic. Shaw's optimism contrasts with Ibsen's 
pessimism. M. Odier calls Ibsen individualistic, 
Shaw social. M. Hamon claims that from the social 
point of view, Shaw's work is richer and deeper 
than Ibsen's ; that in Shaw's work the lower classes 
play a more important part; that he is not interested, 
as Ibsen is, in social pathology ; and that woman is 
considered by Shaw more realistically, in contrast 
with the comparative idealism of Ibsen's treatment. 

Upon the appearance of Shaw's "The Quint- 
essence of Ibsenism," the Germans discovered the 
author's affinity with Nietzsche, whom he then began 
to study. The result is held to have been a recog- 
nizable obligation and similarity as clear as that with 
Ibsen, and followed likewise by points of disagree- 
ment. Nietzsche explained European nihilism by 
the intermingling of masters and slaves, by the dis- 
appearance of castes ; he believed the Superman to 
be realizable by a small number of masters rigor- 
ously separated from the troop of slaves. Superman 
is the aim and ideal of his thesis, caste regime but 
a means ; if this means be ill-chosen, it must be 
changed. 

Shaw's divergence from an older conception of 
socialism lies in distinguishing between the emo- 
tional element and what has clumsily been called the 



scientific element. The first he regards as unneces- 
sary, and even as unworthy of socialism. By means 
of the second he attempts to sever the old union 
of moral romanticism and socialism. For this 
purpose he borrowed from Nietzsche both the word 
and idea of Superman, declaring that the aspira- 
tion to the Superman and its preaching by Nietzsche 
accords with the religious precept, "Ye must be 
born again." But as opposed to what might be 
called the class philosophy of Nietzsche, Shaw holds 
that the two fundamental institutions of our society, 
property and marriage, are unfavorable to the ad- 
vent of Superman. The opposite opinion arose from 
the fallacy that men could be bred for the develop- 
ment of particular traits, just as cocks are bred for 
their combative qualities. On the contrary, what in 
man is really important we do not yet clearly under- 
stand. It is the " inconscient " which is the living 
source of all his energies. After selection we must 
trust to instinct. Shaw then falls back on communism 
for methods and means for the attainment of the ideal 
of Superman. In other words, his synthesis com- 
bines real communism with the fundamental tenet 
of Nietzsche. The leading critics are in the main 
agreed on this point. M. Cestre arrives at prac- 
tically the same conclusion from another viewpoint, 
hinting that Nietzsche is a variation of Carlyle ; and 
he adds that Shaw is a democratic Carlyle. 

The only one of Shaw's plays that has yet been 
acted in the French-speaking world is " Candida," 
and that was first played, not in the French but in 
the Belgian capital. It seems to have been a sub- 
stantial success — due partly to the fact that it was 
well acted, but doubtless still more to the intelligent 
interest aroused by a discourse on the dramatist's 
work, and an exposition of "Candida" in particu- 
lar, which M. Hamon delivered immediately before 
the performance. M. Brisson regrets that the Paris 
production had no such preliminary explanation ; 
the dramatis personm, he comments, escape classifi- 
cation, are incomprehensible to the Frenchman, and 
disconcert him. " The atmosphere chills ; we feel 
that we are not in touch with the author. Eugene 
exasperates, Burgess seems caricatured. Yet there 
is a creative force, a desire to ignore the superficial 
and to dig down to the naked truth ; there is a beauty 
which I only perceive in spots, and I more than 
regret my lack of comprehension. Candida is not 
ours. An effort is necessary in order to fathom her. 
In many of our plays we see a woman obsessed by 
a husband and a lover, hesitating between the two, 
or resigning herself to both. The moment we under- 
stand her character we foresee the conclusion. Can- 
dida does not belong to any of our categories ; she 
is apart." M. Bidou calls Candida an embodiment 
of charity, reason, and love. " She has the good 
sense that belongs to our race. Does she not get 
her reasonableness from the Celtic spirit, which is 
as practical as it is imaginative ? An Ibsen heroine 
would have acted otherwise." Another critic calls 
attention to the " Doll's House " as being anti-social 
in comparison with Candida. MM. Hamon and 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

Cestre are of conflicting opinions in regard to the 
wife's motive for staying with her husband, — the 
one holding that it is from love, not from duty, the 
other contending that Candida believes it her duty 
to remain with the man who needs her most. 
M. Recouly, speaking of Morell, asks: "This need 
of setting forth so candidly his conjugal felicity, 
and associating the kingdom of heaven with the joys 
of married life, this mania of preaching to the 
young celibate, urging him to take his part of a 
God-given happiness, — is it not for all the world 
like a British clergyman ? " 

The Paris production of " Candida " was a dis- 
tinctly literary enterprise, and on the whole was 
coldly received. The piece was generally regarded 
as too remarkable to be laughed at, and many con- 
fessed that its originality gave them pause ; but also 
that they did not understand it. Frenchwomen, it 
has been said, understand Candida but do not accept 
her. Some think that the play which should have 
been presented first is " Mrs. Warren's Profession," 
and this notwithstanding its resemblance to Maupas- 
sant's " Yvette." But from this M. Michaud dis- 
sents. There is no danger, he says, that from a 
given situation Shaw will draw conclusions that 
either seem to be logical or that are ever twice the 
same. He seems to take pleasure in this, and in 
inserting in the same play ideas most opposed to 
each other. In this art he excels ; and it is appar- 
ently the most substantial profit that he gets. 

Allied to the question of feminism, of which Lady 
Cicely and Mrs. Clandon are but two out of many 
examples, is the question of love and its treatment 
in ways that are novel to the French public. Shaw's 
ignoring of the unpleasant aspects of realism, in con- 
trast to Ibsen or to Tolstoi, has been the subject of 
no more comment than the absence of physical pas- 
sion. This gives rise to types absolutely unknown 
to the French stage, such as the chaste bachelor, the 
Philanderer. There is not in Shaw the sentimen- 
talism of corruption of which Murger's "La Vie de 
Boheme " is an instance. Schopenhauer, according 
to M. Cestre, influenced Shaw and his theory of love, 
in that with him love has a physical basis and moral 
effects. The idealism with which love is surrounded 
is only a trap which nature sets for us to ensure the 
perpetuation of the race. Love, while thus losing 
its poetry in a way, none the less has a noble moral 
beauty, binding us to nature and revealing our 
responsibilities. The special manner in which Shaw 
treats love as a duel between the sexes is quite new 
to the French. Exultation in love is the summit of 
strength, of courage, the triumph of impulse over 
individualism. Valentine, for example, in "You 
Never Can Tell," feels that the triumph of love in 
him is a defeat of his nature, a surrendering of 
individualism. The duel is found in "Man and 
Superman," the genius of producing life in the 
woman versus the genius of producing thought in 
man. Quite different also is the Shaw way from 
that of Dumas, in whose work a plot hangs on a 
custom or legal detail. " Divorce " deals with a 



special point of legislation ; whereas with Shaw there 
is a thesis of general psychology, of love in general, 
and of marriage considered as a psychological event. 
This aspect of his work is, however, not the only 
point of interest. The employment of three kinds 
of background is noted: (1) the historic, as in 
" The Devil's Disciple " and " Antony and Cleo- 
patra " ; ( 2 ) an exotic setting, a world of surprise, 
accepted by the English, too extravagant for the 
French ; (3) a setting not exotic, but strange, as the 
Ibsen Club in " The Philanderer," or the transfor- 
mation of the upper circle in " Major Barbara." 
The variety of the minor or episodic characters is 
unchallenged, but there are diverse views in regard 
to the major ones. M. Cestre may not voice the cur- 
rent Anglo-Saxon opinion when he says that Shaw's 
men are portraits of Shaw himself. The women 
too, the lecturer adds, do not have the same com- 
plexity or the same conformity to the conditions of 
life that women of the French theatre have. Shaw's 
successful character-differentiation is the accident of 
fertile invention, not the outcome of interest in the 
individual. 

Notwithstanding the entente cordiale, the French 
still delight in jibes of the olden time ; and Shaw's 
caustic remarks to his native audience delight their 
hearts. Here is one explanation of how he cap- 
tured London : in a country where the theatre was 
chiefly given to dancing, a man appeared whose 
plays made people think. Intelligent and literate 
spectators, like people who have fasted for too long, 
threw themselves on the new food, carrying along 
with them the snobs who abound there in greater 
numbers than anywhere else in the world. In this 
way was Shaw's success made. Another critic adds : 
thus Shaw, with almost excessive but sincere auda- 
city, an almost heroic perseverance, a fantasy and 
an ingenuity ceaselessly renewed, is the English 
writer who has best shown the practical and moral- 
izing genius of this nation of shopkeepers, which is 
never in want of principles to justify her interests. 
This explains the resistance and the favor met with 
in England by this too clear-sighted, indiscreet, and 
amusing moralist. Still other explanations follow : 
Shaw's London audiences had difficulty in under- 
standing him, because his vision of things was not 
like theirs, perverted by prejudices, by obscure sen- 
timents, and by ill-formed ideas. He was indiffer- 
ent to what seemed to them capital questions, and 
curious about others which they wondered were 
asked. He has revealed to his compatriots the 
French disrespect; and if not the only one, is at 
least the one who has proclaimed most loudly that 
all is not for the best in the best of empires. 

This attitude of mind brings forth such an inter- 
pretation of " Candida " as M. Rageot's. The play 
gives us a glimpse, he says, of what we shall like in 
Shaw, and what will, he believes, always escape us 
in his vigorous and combative talent. Above all a 
satirist, he observes the vices of English social life, 
and excels in expressing the secret restlessness of 
certain minds which suffocate in that puritan atmos- 



232

phere, under the national mask of respectability. 
The English mind lives in an atmosphere of false- 
hood and illusion. " Candida " is a vigorous attack 
against false religion (English), against clergymen 
who live by it, and against hypocritical adepts who 
keep it up. It is the more telling because of its 
precision and moderation. What stings the English 
to the quick is hardly felt by the French, who 
remain strangers to the foundation of Shaw's works, 
social satire. 

The French are, of course, convinced that Shaw 
has an excellent subject in satirizing English life. 
They are equally sure that whatever in him is re- 
markable is French, and that they should recognize 
him as one of themselves. M. Blum frankly states 
that in his opinion it will be Shaw's fate to fail, by 
reason of the very French qualities which have 
secured his success in England. M. Odier — who, 
it should be remembered, is Swiss — writes that 
Shaw's seemingly light wit may prevent the French 
from appreciating his common-sense, and will cause 
him to be regarded by most serious people as a char- 
latan. M. Odier holds, with M. Blum, that there 
is in France to-day such a large element of readers 
and playgoers who are enamoured of the exotic and 
the revolutionary in literature, that Shaw may be 
the object of an artificial vogue like that of Ibsen, 
who has never really taken with the French public. 
M. Brisson writes that it is as inevitable that there 
should be Shawites as that there have been Ibsenites, 
but that such a phenomenon has at least the advan- 
tage of enlarging taste. M. Blum presents a detailed 
comparison of Shaw and Beaumarchais ; and M. 
Hamon a much fuller one between Moliere and 
Shaw, heralding the latter as the successor of the 
former, and as the scorner of nineteenth century 
models, Scribe in particular. M. Hamon finds Shaw's 
work un-English, and has no doubt of its ultimate 
acceptance in France. M. Rageot says there is real 
intellectual relationship between Shaw and the 
French ; for if fundamentally he resembles Ibsen, 
and seems to have been influenced by Tolstoi and 
Nietzsche, by the form and turn of his mind he is 
related to Voltaire and Anatole France. Like them, 
he handles irony, which is the only weapon of satire, 
and which is essentially French. M. Michaud's 
words are to the same effect. Translated into our 
tongue, he notes, Shaw will belong to us by more 
than one right : equally by the social, intellectual, 
and Utopian elements in his work. Although he does 
not admire our stage, — he rates Duse above Sarah 
Bernhardt, does not enjoy Musset, still less Sardou, 
Coppe'e, and Rostand, and seems to prefer the The- 
atre de 1'CEuvre to that of the Boulevards, — yet he 
knows that we are of the country of Moliere and of 
Coquelin, that our greatest lyric poet is the author 
of " Les Mise'rables," and that our purest esthete 
placed "Monsieur Bergeret " side by side with the 
English Lake Poets and with Tennyson. 

Discussion of Shaw as a philosopher is apt to stop 
with mere acknowledgement of his suggestiveness. 
M. Blum calls him dramatist and philosopher in 



equal degree ; but doubtless the most eulogistic claim 
comes from M. Roz. Shaw styles himself a philoso- 
pher, he writes ; that is true, provided this word 
calls to our minds, not Descartes or Spencer, but 
rather Anatole France. In effect, if Anatole France 
had been inspired by Schopenhauer, Ibsen, and 
Nietzsche, rather than by Voltaire and Renan, thus 
being or appearing to be more profound, and let the 
wings of his fancy float in metaphysics, he could 
almost give us the idea of Bernard Shaw. Though 
cognizant of the formidable obstacles which must be 
overcome if Shaw's reputation is to cross the Chan- 
nel, M. Cestre is none the less hopeful of ultimate 
success. Summing up the essential factors of the 
situation, he says in substance : One of the leading 
characteristics of Shaw, which ought to call for 
sympathy in the French mind, is the combination 
of the power of observation and of portraiture with 
the philosophical imagination and the reformer's 
enthusiasm. We are not likely to take so much 
interest in the metaphysics of the third act of " Man 
and Superman " as in the psychology spread through- 
out the play. We do not have the longing of Ger- 
manic peoples for the solution of the riddle of the 
universe. We are content to take the cosmos on 
credit, and are rather attracted by artists and thinkers 
who search far and deep into the complex world of 
emotions and motives. Shaw puzzles French readers 
by the (to them) outlandishness of the characters 
and manners of his plays. They are not shocked 
by his onslaughts on respectability and piety, for 
these bogies have long been exploded in France ; 
but it is their sense of literary propriety, their inborn 
regard for sentiment, that are uncomfortably shaken. 
Shaw needs to be explained to them ; but I dare say 
his intellectuality, his keenness and boldness in 
handling moral questions, his art and his wit, will 
in the long run be appreciated. Apt as the French 
are to worship literary canons, they will have to be 
gently initiated into a new form of problem play. 
Alexander Dumas and his disciples opposed on the 
stage the individual passions or collective prejudices 
whence spring social evil, or they dramatized the 
conflict of feelings which arise from the marriage 
laws. But no French dramatist has yet done what 
Shaw so well succeeds in doing, — describing the 
ethics of a future state of society involved in a pic- 
ture of present-day manners, and attributing to his 
characters unwonted feelings and unusual motives 
of action, while making them living and likable, in 
so many ways of our own kith and kin. 

It may be too early to predict whether or not 
Shaw's name in France will be known only to the 
few, like Swinburne's or Meredith's, or become a 
veritable household word like Kipling's or like 
Wells's. A hopeful interpretation may be put on 
the comparative disregard of his superficial quali- 
ties, such as paradox and verbal brilliancy, to the 
advantage of psychologic and social phases. To 
think of Shaw, even tentatively, as the English 
Anatole France, seems to have a certain attraction 
for the latter's compatriots. It would be quite

unfair to say, although the comparison has been 
frequently remarked, that it has been made too 
much of. The fact itself suffices to show how- 
respectful the consensus of French opinion is. The 
contrast in the two estimates could not perhaps be 
more glaringly illustrated than in the reflection of 
the probable effect in America, if not in England, 
of a serious discussion of the author of "L'He des 
Pingouins" as the Bernard Shaw of France.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Mr. Sanborn as his own - publisher offers 
good value at a small price in the third edition of 
his " Life and Letters of John Brown, Liberator of 
Kansas and Martyr of Virginia." Henceforth pub- 
lisher as well as author of this authoritative biog- I 
raphy of his one-time friend and associate, Mr. 
Sanborn, in a circular addressed " to librarians and 
others," tells how the book was begun in the stress 
of the Civil "War, how he spent a large part of 
twenty-five years in collecting material for it, and , 
had access to all the family papers in its preparation. 
''Opinions about Brown will long be divided," he i 
says in a characteristic passage of his circular, 
" but opinions are not history, and ought not to be 
the main stuff of biography. Facts of uncontested 
value make the staple of my book, and though I '■ 
have not avoided the expression of opinion, that 
part of the book has been based on the careful 
examination of conflicting evidence." The first vol- 
ume of the author's recent •' Recollections of Seventy ! 
Years " contains much additional matter concerning 
Brown and his friends ; likewise his " Memoir of ; 
Dr. S. G. Howe," published nineteen years ago, 
gives further particulars ; and the final volume of 
his edition of Theodore Parker's works, to appear 
soon, " will set forth, more fully than elsewhere, the 
connection of that eminent man with Brown and his 
plans." But the biography itself, a work of about 
650 pages, is indispensable to the student of John 
Brown and his times, and the greatly reduced price 
at which it is now offered should secure for it many ! 

new readers.

'• The greatest physicist in America," as ' 
President Stanley Hall termed the late Professor i 
Dolbear. was possessed of a modesty that stands 
in pleasing contrast with the overweaning self- ] 
confidence and unabashed assertive n ess of so many j 
other possessors of brilliant gifts. Not a few anec- 
dotes illustrating Dolbear's literary likings, his ideal- 
ism, and the unaffected charm and simplicity of his l 
nature, have found their way into print since his I 
death. A friend, calling on him one summer morn- ' 
ing three years ago, when he was already stricken j 
with the disease that ended his life, found him sit- , 
ting on the piazza of his house, overlooking the 
college campus, with a table near him on which lay 
a single book — a spiritual interpretation of nature — 



Mr. Charles G. Whiting's "Walks in New England." 
" I 'm reading this book you kindly sent to me," he 
remarked, " and I am much interested. I find that 
it fits my present need better than anything else. I 
can read it backward or forward, just as I used to 
read Emerson." Invited to walk across the campus 
with his host to his laboratory, the friend paused on 
the way to point to a cluster of chicory in full bloom, 
and to say : " I find myself coming to the conviction 
that the biologists are wrong in their conception that 
the bloom of a plant is related simply to the propa- 
gation of the species. To me it seems that beauty is 
the real object and purpose of the world of flowers." 
To this heterodox utterance the scientist most unex- 
pectedly and impressively replied : M You are right." 
So modest was his estimate of the value of his own 
contributions to science that he parted with an im- 
portant invention in telegraphy to the Western Union 
Company for less than one-seventh of what that 
wealthy corporation was fully prepared to pay the 
inventor. He had simply named the amount that 
would lift a mortgage then resting on his house, and 
perhaps leave him a little over, and counted himself 
fortunate to have his price accepted. With his many 
important inventions in connection with the tele- 
graph and the telephone — including telegraphing 
without wires, now so widely and successfully used — 
the one referred to seemed but a little thing, and he 
valued it according to its cost to him, not by its 
usefulness to others. ... 

The king of cartoonists at ninety lives

pencil now forever laid aside, and his sight wholly 
gone, but his step still firm and his form but slightly 
bent. Sir John Tenniel, who so graphically told the 
political history of half a century, did all his work 
with only one eye to guide the movements of his rapid 
pencil. An early fencing bout with his brother, 
without masks, ended disastrously for the artist. 
Of all the hopeful band who were associated with 
Sir John on the staff of u Punch " in its early days, 
fifty years ago, Mr. Henry Silver is the only survi- 
vor. In his home there hangs one of the cartoonist's 
water-color drawings, with the signatures of those 
congenial spirits who used to sit around "The Table" 
and enjoy the feast of reason and the flow of soul, 
as well as more material nourishment, every Wed- 
nesday evening. There are to be seen the names 
of John Tenniel, Mark Lemon, Thackeray, Tom 
Taylor, John Leech, William Bradbury, Fred Evans, 
Percival Leigh, and Henry Silver. Besides such 
famous cartoons as " Dropping the Pilot " and "The 
British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger," 
Sir John is entitled to our lasting gratitude for his 
apt illustrations to " Alice in Wonderland " and 
"Through the Looking-Glass " — masterpieces that 
now (since the expiration of copyright) may be 
obtained in editions costing no more than ten cents. 
It would be almost a crime to bring up a child 
without these two books, illustrated by Sir John 
Tenniel, in the nursery.

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



A DIFFICULT TASK IN MANUSCRIPT-DECIPHERING, 

comparable with the arduous achievement in turning 
Pepys's voluminous and cryptic diary into common 
script, has been completed by the Rev. Nehemiah 
Curnock, D.D., for many years editor of " The 
Methodist Recorder" (London). John Wesley's 
journals, some written in Byrom's shorthand, some 
in an abbreviated long hand, and some in a secret 
cipher of Wesley's own devising and subject to fre- 
quent changes, have been at last made accessible in 
full to all readers, in an annotated edition filling six 
substantial volumes. The first volume, just pub- 
lished, deals with the American travels of him who 
said, " I look upon all the world as my parish." 
For simple, vigorous, idiomatic English, setting forth 
the life-history of one whose missionary experience 
and acute observations were richly worth recording, 
there is nothing to be compared with the Wesleyan 
journals. George Fox's record of his sufferings and 
his missionary labors is a wonderful work, but lacks 
the variety and vivacity of Wesley's story. When 
one recalls that the founder of Methodism travelled, 
by his own account, more than four thousand miles 
a year for about sixty years — or a quarter-million 
miles in all — it is no wonder his journals possess 
life and embrace a wide range of topics. The edi- 
tor's four years of puzzling over the mysterious 
cipher, and the happy solution of the problem that 
came to him in a dream, contribute to make this 
first complete edition of the journals a memorable 

work.

The need of a neutral pronoun, or pronoun 
of common gender and applicable to either man or 
woman, boy or girl, is vaguely felt by even the least 
reflective speaker or writer. Every now and then an 
arbitrary formation (like thon, for instance) is des- 
perately put forward for adoption by some language- 
mender ; but the great general public, and even the 
smaller learned and literary and philological public, 
refuse to have anything to do with the queer-looking 
thing — perhaps suspecting it of being an emanation 
of reformed spelling, rather than a new word. Our 
English cousins bluntly meet the emergency, when 
it arises, by throwing grammar into the North Sea 
and letting " they" and " their " and "them " stand 
for "he or she," "his or her," and "him or her," 
respectively. Authors of repute calmly write such 
sentences as this : It is everybody's duty to love 
their country. It may be that this use of a plural 
pronoun in place of that neutral singular which half 
a thousand years or more have failed to evolve for 
us, is the best that can now be hoped for. Made- 
to-order words, like made-to-order spellings, are 
things that the public has little stomach for. 

The Mankato Public Library is probably 
unknown to ninety-nine general readers out of a 
hundred — possibly to an even larger proportion. 
In fact, Mankato itself might not be quickly and 
correctly located by more than two out of every 
twenty-five of these same " general readers." It is 



a Minnesota city, of about twelve thousand inhabi- 
tants, eighty miles or so from St. Paul, in a south- 
westerly direction ; it is the reputable seat of a highly 
reputable State Normal School ; and its citizens 
maintain a good and useful and wide-awake library. 
But what especially strikes one, in reading the libra- 
rian's sixteenth annual report, is the liberality of the 
Mankatoans to their library employees in respect to 
vacations and leaves of absence. " The extension of 
vacation from three weeks to a month," we read, " and 
the extra week allowed for attendance at the A. L. A. 
conference, were very much appreciated by both 
librarian and assistant, as was also the privilege 
granted the assistant to attend the state meeting at 
Duluth." Moreover, an examination of the "Finan- 
cial Report " of the Mankato Library seems to reveal 
a praiseworthy liberality in the matter of salaries — 
for so small a city. Much is being written and said 
about the inadequate pay of library workers and 
their too close confinement. Encouraging, therefore, 
are these signs of a better order of things at Man- 
kato, whose enlightened policy may well be adopted 
elsewhere. 

The rapid growth of the English language, 
in number of words and in new meanings for old 
words, is reflected in the increasing size of our dic- 
tionaries. The indispensable " Webster " reappears 
at short intervals in more and more plethoric form ; 
and now the publishers of the " Century Dictionary," 
which first appeared in 1891, are about to offer two 
supplementary volumes containing nearly a hundred 
thousand new words, new uses of old words, and 
new items in the proper-name division, with nineteen 
hundred new illustrations, and other less important 
additions. Owners of the previously issued volumes 
are to be favored in the distribution of the new ones, 
and then the price will be advanced for the public 
in general. The reason why our language contains 
more words than any other European tongue is 
obvious enough. Its wide distribution over two hemi- 
spheres, among peoples of invention and resource, 
who are constantly making discoveries in science and 
enlarging the bounds of knowledge, could not but 
insure its rapid growth. Moreover, its genius favors 
the formation of new compounds and the attachment 
of new meanings to old terms. It can be no restricted 
vocabulary that serves the needs of Briton and 
American, Australian and South African, East 
Indian, West Indian, and Philippine Islander.

Librarian Lummis's resignation of his Los

regret did it not involve the restoration of a highly 
original and useful worker to the fields of scientific 
and historical research and authorship. Mr. Lum- 
mis's five years' management of the Los Angeles 
Public Library has proved him a most resourceful, 
original, and energetic librarian. With a substantial 
basis of scholarship, but no false reverence for hoary 
tradition, he has made innovations that at first made 
his worthy associates gasp and stare. Who else

could ever have introduced the roof-garden idea 
into librarianism, or the poison-label for untrust- 
worthy books? The roof-garden has proved a suc- 
cess, a crown of success, on the Los Angeles library. 
The poison-label is still on trial as to its practicability 
in libraries unequipped with a staff of experts in all 
departments of learning. Mr. Lummis's varied 
adventures and extended travels over a large part 
of the western hemisphere, and his books describing 
those experiences and researches, would furnish 
matter for a long and unusually interesting article, 
or volume, which will doubtless some day be writ- 
ten. At present we have to note with regret his 
relinquishment of a task which he has shown him- 
self well fitted to perform, and to hail with satisfac- 
tion his re-entrance into the domain of authorship. 
After all, the pen is mightier than the Dewey 
Decimal System. 

A renewal of the fight for Greek at Oxford 
reopens the interminable debate over the comparative 
claims of the humanities and the sciences. An essay 
on u How to Save Greek," from the pen of a Mr. 
Snow, fellow of St. John's, is made the text of a 
few approving comments by Dr. Gilbert Murray, 
the well-known Grecian ; and although he had 
hitherto been inclined to relinquish compulsory 
classics at Oxford, Dr. Murray now acknowledges 
the force of Mr. Snow's argument, and would have 
both Oxford and Cambridge remain true to the old 
traditions. These two old universities, he well 
observes, " indisputably excel in a certain kind of 
literary, philosophic, and historical education based 
on the knowledge of antiquity," and therefore he 
would leave to other and less ancient seats of learn- 
ing the development of a school of English literature 
not grounded on the study of classical antiquity. 
Dwelling on this point further, he asks : " Ought 
there not to be one place where English literature 
is taught, as a matter of course and necessity, with 
regard to its spiritual origins? " This is well. Yet 
it may be that in the progress of the centuries, and 
in the increasing strenuousness of modern life, Greek 
and Latin will be forced to yield to the stress even 
more than they have yet done — much as Hebrew 
has to-day become an all but unknown tongue even 
to theologians. 

A periodical relapse might perhaps serve as 
a not unfit phrase to apply to the late abandonment 
of the journalistic struggle on the part of " Putnam's 
Magazine." Originally founded in 1853 by Mr. G. P. 
Putnam, the founder also of the Putnam house of 
publishers, and edited by George William Curtis, the 
magazine received the support of such able pens as 
those of Longfellow, Lowell, Thoreau, Stoddard, and 
Stedman : but it suspended publication after only four 
years. Recalled to life half a century later (1906) 
by Mr. George Haven Putnam, the present head of 
the Putnam house, and given a rejuvenated appear- 
ance, with abundance of pictorial embellishment 
and special features, and absorbing into itself '* The 



Critic " (which had already assimilated " The 
Literary World") and also "The Reader," the 
combined enterprise has, like the old " Putnam's," 
enjoyed a four years' existence. And now the new 
" Putnam's," with the predigested publications above- 
named, is swallowed at a gulp by another maga- 
zine of more vigorous constitution, " The Atlantic 
Monthly." Fervently do we hope that the absorbing 
and merging process will go no further — that the 
one distinctive magazine which makes its appeal on 
the ground of literary merit, and on that alone, will 
long be spared to the civilization which it does so 
much to promote and adorn.

A grain of Shakespearian wheat from a 
bushel of chaff is well worth the labor of win- 
nowing, to the scholar in quest of any slightest 
scrap of new information about the great poet. 
Professor Charles William Wallace of the Univer- 
sity of Nebraska has beguiled a summer holiday by 
some toilsome researches in the Public Record 
Office at London, where mountains of ancient legal 
documents await the scrutiny of the antiquary and 
the historian. What the Nebraskan professor has 
gleaned affects not at all the question of the author- 
ship of the Shakespearian plays ; but it makes clear 
that Shakespeare at one time lived with a wig- 
maker's family of the name of Mountjoy in Silver 
Street, that he was interested in its affairs, and that 
he appeared in a law court for these Mountjoys. 
Furthermore, a new signature is added to the few 
now ascribed to Shakespeare's pen. This is suffi- 
ciently careless and lacking in clearness to be 
undoubtedly genuine. It reads "Willm Shaks" 
— evidently a sort of personal mark rather than a 
complete signature, and throws but little light on 
the problem of whether or not the poet really knew 
how to spell his own name. 

A GATHERING OF THE DESCENDANTS OF GREAT 

poets, soon to be held in London, should be a rarely 
interesting occasion. The secretary of the Poetry 
Recital Society, which is moving in the matter, has 
said: "Among the most cheering facts that have 
come to light in our correspondence is that nearly 
all these descendants are comparatively well-to-do 
folk. The poets may have starved in their own day, 
but they have left their posterity in quite a number 
of cases remarkably well provided for. The greater 
proportion belong to the upper middle class. As 
regards the great poets themselves, there are, of 
course, some regrettable gaps. There is no actual 
descendant of Shakespeare, though we have found 
descendants of his grandparents on both sides. 
Milton is yet wholly unrepresented, and the name 
of Keats seems to have vanished as though it had, 
in very truth, been ' writ in water.' Shelley has no 
living descendant, though of course the present Sir 
John Shelley and others of the family are distant 
cousins." The prospective banquet will be held, it 
is expected, on Wordsworth's birthday, April 7.

Afloat and Ashore with a Yankee 
Admiral.* 



Admiral Evans's account of his naval service 
up to the close of the Spanish war has been fol- 
lowed by a volume of similar size and character, 
continuing the narrative to the author's retire- 
ment from the navy, at the age of sixty-two, in 
1908. " An Admiral's Log " is written in the 
same frank and straightforward style as the pre- 
vious volume, sometimes humorous and mildly 
sarcastic, but always holding the reader's willing 
attention. After a brief opening chapter on 
" The. Sampson-Schley Controversy," in which 
the writer's sympathies are, as before, heartily 
on the side of Admiral Sampson, he tells the 
story of the ridiculous trial of the Governor of 
Samoa. Admiral Evans presided over the court- 
martial, as ordered by the Secretary of the 
Navy ; and after relating the honorable acquittal 
of the accused, he permits himself this conclud- 
ing comment : 

" In all my experience with courts-martial I have 
never known a case so weak as this one was, nor one 
where there was so little ground for charges. Upon 
my return to Washington I ascertained how the whole 
matter came about. The general impression was that 
the charges, or the complaint on which the charges 
were based, had in some way come from the mission- 
aries, but this was not the case. A letter in a woman's 
hand-writing was received by the Secretary of the Navy 
reciting certain bad conduct on the part of the governor. 
The Secretary cut off the name of the writer and then 
sent the letter to the proper officers of the Department, 
with an order to prepare the charges. Thus, practically 
on an anonymous letter, the expense of sending this 
court so many thousands of miles was incurred, not to 
mention the injury to the reputation and feelings of the 
officer, who up to that time had enjoyed a fine repu- 
tation." 

But, as the writer observes later, in connection 
with an official condemnation of certain indis- 
pensable survey work he was conducting in 
Philippine waters, " swivel chairs sometimes 
have the effect of warping the judgment of those 
that occupy them." The author's voyage to 
Samoa afforded him an opportunity to visit 
Honolulu, and he remarks in passing that the 
whole question of the defence of the Sandwich 
Islands is a most difficult one, and that he is 
" puzzled to understand how anyone, particu- 
larly a professional man, can consider them any-

thing but a source of weakness to us in case of 
war with any naval power in the Pacific." In 
such event, the defending army, 50,000 strong 
at least, would have to be fed from the Cali- 
fornia coast, more than two thousand miles 
distant. 

The most interesting events chronicled in the 
Admiral's Log relate, of course, to his cruise in 
Eastern waters (with landings in China, Japan, 
and the Philippines), and his conduct of the 
Atlantic Fleet from Hampton Roads to San 
Francisco, in its famous round-the-world voyage. 
Speaking of President Roosevelt's parting 
words to him just before the fleet left Hampton 
Roads on its long cruise, the author says : 

" On this occasion it was plain from his manner that 
Mr. Roosevelt felt deeply the importance of the step he 
had decided to take, and which had centred upon the 
navy of the United States the critical attention of the 
whole world. ... I was most gratified to have the 
President say to me, as he did, < Remember, Admiral 
Evans, you sail with the confidence of the President 
more completely than any admiral ever did before. 
Your cruise is a peaceful one, but you realise your 
responsibility if it should turn out otherwise ! ' " 

And a little further on, illustrating the material 
from which war-scares are so often manufac- 
tured, we find this entry : 

" Before the fleet sailed from Hampton Roads, I had 
seen several letters giving information that we were to 
be blown up and sunk on our way to the Pacific, the 
first attack being promised for Rio and the second in 
the Straits of Magellan. All the letters that I saw were 
anonymous, dated in Canada, and named either the 
Japanese government or the Japanese as the ones who 
were going to do us up. It seemed to me strange that 
the Japanese government should tell these men without 
names in Canada when and how they were going to de- 
stroy the battleships of a friendly nation ! And I am 
free to confess that I considered the whole story un- 
worthy of notice." 

The sojourn in the East came at a rather criti- 
cal period. The Boxer insurrection had just 
been quelled, and the allied armies were en- 
camped before Pekin. An interview with the 
late Empress Dowager affords material for an 
interesting passage. 

" The minister presented me in a few words to her 
Majesty, and, standing at a distance of about twenty 
feet, I repeated the speech I had sent her some days 
before — at least a portion of it. She replied with the 
speech she had sent me, and then an unusual thing 
happened. She said to the minister through her inter- 
preter : ' Ask the Admiral to come near me ; I wish to 
converse with him.' . . . Then I looked into the eyes 
of this woman who ruled over four hundred millions of 
people, holding their lives and the destiny of her country 
in the hollow of her hand. Beautiful, appealing brown 
eyes looked back at me out of a face that must at one 
time have been strikingly beautiful. Every line of it 
indicated firmness and strength; the mouth alone sug-

gested cruelty, if occasion called for it. A more striking 
face, one to be longer remembered, I have never seen. 
. . . The Empress Dowager spoke deliberately and with 
dignity. The interpreter received her words, bumped 
his head on the floor, raised his eyes, and repeated in 
English what she had said. I replied; another bump 
of the head, and with downcast eyes he conveyed my 
message to her Majesty. Thus, for about twenty min- 
utes, the conversation continued, growing more inter- 
esting as she stated her side of the Boxer troubles, and 
the cruel punishment China had received, as a nation, 
for the doings of a band of outlaws. As the conversation 
progressed, the dark-brown eyes blazed, and I felt that 
it would be impossible for me to attempt to deceive the 
woman who was watching me so earnestly. Officially, 
she knew no word of English, but several times she 
started to reply before my words had been translated, 
which convinced me that she understood well every 
word I was saying. The rapid changes of expression 
on her face also led me to this conclusion. The inter- 
view concluded with these words from her Majesty: 
' After all my country has suffered, I find she has but 
one friend in the world. That, Admiral, is the great 
country you represent.' " 

The author came away from the interview fully- 
aware that he " had enjoyed the privilege of 
seeing the most remarkable woman in the world 
show her real feeling." 

In approaching the city of Manila, Admiral 
Evans was curiously impressed by the sight of 
the stars and stripes flying in that part of the 
world. " It caused a curious sensation," he 
writes, " to see our beloved flag displayed over 
this foreign, tropical city, and I am not sure 
that I did not feel that it was out of place. 
However, there it was ; it had cost many valu- 
able lives to put it there, and it would cost many 
more before it could ever come down." This 
outcropping of sailor logic occurs again, even 
more characteristically, a few pages later, in 
describing a conversation with a malcontent 
native of influence and position. " One could 
not argue with such a fool," he concludes. " He, 
no doubt, represented a large class who were 
in a position to influence the feelings of the 
people. Education will in time remedy all this. 
If it does not, bullets and bayonets, I know, 
will." 

With Admiral Evans's forced resignation 
(owing to illness) of the command of the fleet at 
San Francisco, and his retirement from the ser- 
vice soon afterward, we reach the end of the 
book — a tip-top yarn, one may be allowed to call 
it, in the vernacular familiar to the sailor-author. 
There are some interesting portraits and illus- 
trations, of which the view of the fleet entering 
San Francisco harbor is the most impressive.

Novels or Xovelists j * 

Professor Phelps's book on " Modern Novel- 
ists" is extremely interesting. It is about 
novelists some of whom are familiar and some 
unfamiliar except by name ; so that there is a 
pleasant variation of feeling about them, and yet 
a constant entertainment. The author knows all 
about them, too ; so that one feels confident, as 
one proceeds, that one will have no hasty though 
brilliant superficialities. He is original and 
independent ; so that we get the ideas of the 
critic instead of the conventionalities of current 
criticism. He (probably) differs from us in some 
respects ; so that we can have, as we read, the 
pleasing superior confidence that we know more 
than he does, in some things at least. 

This last feeling I have in one matter to an 
extreme degree : I feel that I know better than 
the author how his book should have been writ- 
ten. This is an idea not uncommon with critics 
and college professors, and in others I am apt to 
esteem it foolish. In this case, however, I think 
that Professor Phelps should have written on 
Modern Novels instead of Modern Novelists. 

The biographical view of art or literature is 
very common nowadays. The reason is that 
almost everybody is interested in people, and 
very few in art, whether art in poetry, painting, 
music, or anything else. Hence a thousand 
persons, at least in America, like to hear what 
sort of man a given novelist is, for one who 
cares what sort of novels he writes. Of course 
Mr. Phelps does not carry his biographical ten- 
dency so far as to fill his pages with personal 
gossip such as one reads in the literary maga- 
zines of the day. He is generally interested in 
the ideas and standpoints of his author, his 
philosophy of life and his Weltanschauung ; 
and he is so occupied with these things that he 
says very little about his novels as novels. You 
could read several of his essays, and, except by 
accident or other knowledge, you would not 
know that you were reading about a novelist 
rather than a dramatist, or even a poet or 
essayist. It is just as though critics wrote 
about Shakespeare without giving an idea that 
he was a writer of plays : indeed, that is the 
way they generally do write about him. Shake- 
speare's view of life is what people like : of his 
way of expressing that view, they care little 
and know less. Of course Mr. Phelps is not 
like that; he often alludes to the art of the

novelist, — but he is so absorbed in the intel- 
lectual personality of his subjects that he says 
but little about it. 

Now this position may be proper enough in 
some of the essays in this volume, but it is 
clearly inadequate in one — namely, that on 
Mrs. Humphry Ward. Of most novelists, Mr. 
Phelps is content to lay chief stress on the ideas. 
But Mrs. Ward he holds to be a poor novelist, 
and therefore he must direct his attention to 
her novels. But it appears to me that although 
he makes it clear enough that Mrs. Ward is 
not a keen or original observer, nor a deep 
thinker, he does not show that she does not 
write good novels. 

A little more on this point will be to the pre- 
sent purpose. Mr. Phelps gives the impression 
that Mrs. Ward's reputation is only an immense 
vogue among women, and especially among the 
superficial readers of " best sellers "; and that 
it is founded mostly upon the social respecta- 
bility of her books and her own journalistic 
sciolism. I am sure that this idea is incorrect. 
Mrs. Ward is read and admired by many of 
the most cultivated and acute novel-readers 
of this country. I have read only two of her 
later novels, but I know a number of people of 
taste and appreciation who have read more and 
thought highly of them. From " Lady Rose's 
Daughter " and " The Marriage of William 
Ashe," I have come to a different idea of her 
reputation from Mr. Phelps. I believe that 
while people like to read her partly because (as 
Mr. Phelps indicates) she flatters their idea that 
they are reading something very intellectual, 
dealing with great problems, etc., the chief 
reason that they read her is because she writes 
good novels ; more particularly, because her 
novels are not only good, but in some especial 
directions extremely good. Mr. Phelps, with 
his eye on the novelist, does not perceive this. 

It is hardly to the purpose to give here a 
critique on the art of Mrs. Ward, especially as 
it would have to be based on a recollection of 
two of her many books. I merely wish to point 
out that Mr. Phelps says almost nothing about 
it. He seems to think that she has no art, at 
least not enough to enable her to write " su- 
premely well," and stand up to the test when 
" compared with the great masters of fiction." 
I feel sure that, however correct this view may 
be in its results, Mr. Phelps in stating it is 
neglecting a very important element in the study 
and criticism of fiction. Anybody who talks 
even a little with novelists of the day will per- 
ceive that they think there is something about 



novel-writing which is called " technique." They 
usually think, also, that they have more of this 
article than Scott, and doubtless other classic 
novelists, though Scott is the one with whom 
they usually compare themselves. Their idea is 
that Scott is a greater man, has a bigger view of 
life, a better grasp of character, a finer appreci- 
ation of nature, than they, so that his books are 
fundamentally more interesting than theirs ; but 
that in technique he is inferior. In this view 
I think they are fairly correct ; that is, there is 
at present a knowledge of a certain sort of 
technique in novel-writing that Scott did not 
have. This technique may be something really 
fine, or it may not be ; but its result is to make 
a book interesting, to make people want to go 
on reading it when they have begun. It does 
not provide the novelist with ideas, but when 
he has any ideas it shows him how to handle 
them so as to be interesting. 

Just what this "technique" is, I have never 
been able to find out ; nor is it of any import- 
ance here, except to note that it consists largely 
of manipulation of plot so as to be interesting. 
This is only one element in the Complete Art 
of Novel-writing ; but it is an important one. 
It has been analyzed in various ways by different 
critics, and more or less obscurely understood 
by many novelists. But however analyzed and 
however understood, it seems to me that there 
is a certain way of telling a story that is better 
than other ways, in that it is interesting to 
the human mind in general. I should say that 
the " way " that was most widely and lastingly 
powerful was the best technique. How lasting 
is the power of Mrs. Ward's method, I will not 
undertake to say. I fear it is not very perma- 
nent ; but that it is very wide in its appeal, 
including cultured and uncultured alike, seems 
to me obvious. In other words, she has art in 
her way more than Mark Twain or Sienkiewicz, 
though they have in their ways more art than 
she, perhaps, or certainly more genius. And 
her way is more specifically the art of the nov- 
elist. Mrs. Ward is best to be compared with 
Sudermann. Both give superficial views on life 
in the guise of deep delvings in the mines of 
truth ; both instinctively play to the galleries. 
But both are great masters of one element (and 
that the same) of the art of novel-writing. 

Now all the preceding may be nonsense in de- 
tail. If it were my business to criticize Mrs. Ward, 
I should have to do it differently. But however 
wrong in detail, the main point is sensible enough 
— namely, that there is an art of fiction, and that 
Mrs. Ward knows something about it, and that

Mr. Phelps, in his interest in ideas and subject- 
matter, in life and criticism of life, has forgotten 
to say much of anything on the subject. 

But, it may be asked, why should he say any- 
thing about it, if he prefers to write about 
something: else ? Why should not a man, even 
if he be especially well-read on something you 
think important, write on something that he 
thinks important ? Why would it not be well 
for you to write about Novels if you wish, and 
let Mr. Phelps write about Novelists ? The 
main reason is that Mr. Phelps himself really 
thinks that what I am talking about is the most 
important thing. He thinks that to concern 
oneself solely with novelists and their ideas is 
but a partial and incomplete way of studying 
literature. He says that " the two most bene- 
ficial ways to study a novel are to regard it, 
first, as an art-form, and secondly, as a mani- 
festation of intellectual life " (p. 249); that 
" the real object [of university study of novels] 
is to persuade him [the student] to read them 
intelligently, to observe the difference be- 
tween good novels and bad, and so to become 
impatient and disgusted with cheap, sensational, 
and counterfeit specimens of the novelist's art " 
(p. 248). It is true that this is said of a stu- 
dent's reading ; but I believe it refers just as 
well to a professor's writing. 

Not that Mr. Phelps says nothing of the art 
of the novelist. He almost always does say 
something about it. But he usually mentions 
it as though it were something to be taken for 
granted, something that everybody knew all 
about, something quite obvious. But the art of 
the novelist is just the reverse of all this. It 
is something very subtle, something that com- 
paratively few people know anything about, 
something that would bear much explanation. 
If a novelist's art be good, it will usually effect 
its purpose without our knowing that it is there. 
And that is the reason why it would be im- 
mensely interesting if anyone so well-read as 
Mr. Phelps, in both theory and practice, would 
write criticism with a special view to it. We 
have had so much of criticism of life, of Welt- 
anschauung, of impressions de la vie, that the 
other thing would be a delight. It might create 
a new epoch in the history of criticism. 

But just now I note that a prominent journal 
calls this book " a volume that bids fair to form 
a distinct and permanent landmark in the his- 
tory of fiction." I do not think so. But let 
everyone that cares which is right read the book 
and see. There is fun enough in that, anyway.

The Ik)re axd Romance of the Fax.* 



The flutter of a fan has often proved a 
momentous trifle. For the fan has been the 
pride and glory of kings and the plaything of 
queens; it has made and unmade ministers, 
airily disposed of great affairs of state. It has 
masqued a coquette's heart, beckoned a prince 
to try his fate in love, waved a general gaily off 
to war, inspired poets, hidden and evoked 
blushes, broken hearts and mended them. And 
all this it has been doing, if not ever since Eve 
walked in her garden, certainly since Cleopatra 
sailed up her Nile. A Spanish tale, recounted 
fittingly on a painted fan, declares that the first 
fan was a wing which Cupid tore from the back 
of Zephyrus, to fan Psyche as she slept on a 
bed of roses. The story has many variants, but 
all agree that Love created the fan, as he ani- 
mates its most effective uses. 

And now this trifle light as air has achieved 
due recognition of its real importance ; modern 
research has turned a search-light upon it, and 
its complete history has been written. This fills 
a bulky quarto volume, whose royal proportions 
are fittingly dedicated to the Princess of Wales, 
gracious patron of fan-makers and owner of 
many rare examples of their art. The text is 
by Mr. G. Woolliscroft Rhead. There are 
many illustrations from plates made by the 
most skilled engravers ; and the edition is 
limited, in proportion to the beauty of embel- 
lishment and the somewhat esoteric interest of 
the text. 

Mr. Rhead makes the most of the varied 
appeal — archaeological, artistic, human — of 
his airy subject. The earlier chapters are of a 
curious interest chiefly. In Egypt, Assyria, 
and India, the fan, like the other features of 
their ancient civilizations, was primitive, — a 
useful fly-whisk or a richly ornate sacerdotal 
symbol or royal standard. It was left for China 
and Japan — the two lands of fans — to re-shape 
the crude early models ; to press into service 
ivory, silk, tortoise-shell, and mother-of-pearl ; 
to carve, lacquer, gild, and paint these rich ma- 
terials till they were more than ever things of 
beauty ; to invent the folding-fan, — and finally 
to send their pretty treasures off to Europe in 
the ships of Portuguese traders, to set the 
western world agog over a new toy. 

It was the Japanese who invented the dagger 
fan, in appearance an ordinary lacquered folding 
fan, but in reality a sheath containing a deadly

blade ; and this brought their other invention, 
the folding-fan, into disrepute, so that a kind 
which only half closed was adopted as official 
court fan. There were special fans for every 
occasion in Japan. Indeed, so important a part 
did (and does) the fan play in Japanese life that 
the greatest artists were not above decorating 
it. Tadahira, it is said, painted upon a fan a 
cuckoo that gave forth its characteristic note 
whenever the fan was opened, and Tsunenori 
drew a lion so lifelike that other beasts fled 
before it. 

Beautiful as were the old Japanese fans, it 
took France and the eighteenth century to pro- 
duce the Golden Age of the art. Conversations 
Galantes furnished at once the best opportunity 
for adroit manipulation of the fan, and the 
ideal motive for its decoration. Spanish and 
Italian ladies got their fans from Paris ; witness 
Goldoni's comedy, where the pother was all 
about a cheap little French fan, " not worth 
perhaps five paoli." Cano de Arevalo, a Span- 
ish painter, took advantage of this vogue for 
Parisian fans to "fake" a number of them. 
His trick was discovered ; but, by a logic that 
took small account of morals, he was thereupon 
hailed as a master and appointed fan-maker to 
the queen. If the French fan-painters were 
the acknowledged masters, the Spanish makers 
were wonderfully skilful in designing and deco- 
rating the sticks ; and the Spanish cavaliers 
and senoritas were the first to invent a fan 
language, which was later translated for the 
belles and beaux of other nations. 

During the first part of the eighteenth cen- 
tury the great vogue of fans led to the making 
of the engraved sort — the fan of the people, 
the poor relation of the aristocratic painted fan. 
This new type speedily became the newspaper of 
the day. Royal foibles and adventures, fashions, 
politics, ballooning, scenes from plays and operas, 
all are depicted, usually with satirical or humor- 
ous verses by way of comment, on the engraved 
fan-mounts. In France, Marlborough was lam- 
pooned, the woes of Louis were mocked at or 
sympathized with, Napoleon's ups and downs 
were chronicled. In England the marriage of 
the Crown Princess and the Prince of Orange 
was such a popular subject that Jonathan Pinch- 
beck's fan, which appeared first, was counter- 
feited, and the war between his Nassau fan and 
its New Nassau rival waged long and merrily 
in " The Craftsman's " advertising columns. 

" Church-fans " appeared in England in the 
early part of the century, as a result of com- 
ments in the public journals on the unsuitability 



of the fan mounts often brought to church. A 
good woman's heart divided among the cardinal 
virtues formed the chaste design of the first 
church-fan, which was speedily followed by a 
more pretentious one published under the patron- 
age of the Bishop of London, and by " chapel- 
fans " for dissenting ladies. To the next century 
belongs the feathered fan of Hassein Dey, which 
actually caused a war; for Hassein hit the 
French consul over the head with his plumed 
fan, and refused to apologize, — whereupon the 
French promptly set about the conquest of 
Algeria. 

Mr. Rhead's work is of course only incident- 
ally anecdotal. Passing fashions, in size, shape, 
decoration, and carving, are chronicled in detail. 
Illustrations are carefully described, and the 
fans of various periods and schools duly ap- 
praised as objets (Tart. For an art fan-making 
has been ; and, after a period of sad decline at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century, it is an 
art still. Charles Conder's Red Fan, and Mr. 
Frank Brangwyn's Blue one, both reproduced 
in this book in full color, are comparable to any 
of the Italian masterpieces or the dainty marvels 
of the Great Age of Louis XV. 

The collector and the connoisseur will not fail 
to appreciate this, the first comprehensive history 
of fan-making in English. We have tried to 
point out its interest for the casual reader. Its 
beauty of illustration cannot be overpraised. 
Twenty- seven colored plates, five times as many 
half tones, and innumerable little line drawings, 
reproduce fans odd, marvellous, unique, and 
beautiful, in generous profusion. Indeed, the 
work is an art treasure as truly as many of the 
famous fans it describes and depicts.

Principles of Architectural 
Expression.* 



It is with a sense of personal loss that the 
reviewer of the first volume of Sturgis's masterly 
History of Architecture opens the second volume 
to let his thoughts dwell upon its pages with 
critical intent. Before the proof-sheets of this 
volume were corrected, he who had travelled so 
widely, had seen so clearly and felt so deeply, 
and, returning, had interested, instructed, and 
inspired his fellows with his accumulated know- 
ledge and enriched spirit, had journeyed to that

bourne whence no traveller returns, and whose 
towers and palaces we must as yet be content 
to see through the inspired eye of imagination. 
It was not to discourage him, nor to undervalue 
the great work that Mr. Sturgis had undertaken, 
that the reviewer suggested the possible advan- 
tage, to the student of life's deeper and richer 
expression, of a certain line of attack in histori- 
cal research and presentation. General history 
is written to-day from the ethnic and psychologi- 
cal standpoint ; and why not also architectural 
history ? In the preface to the present volume, 
almost the last word which Mr. Sturgis ever 
wrote is his acknowledgment of The Dial's 
" suggestive " criticism (March 1, 1907) and the 
statement of his reason for not heeding the sug- 
gestion. The reason given does not altogether 
satisfy. It shows, not the bold imagination of 
the great explorer venturing out upon the main, 
but rather the studied caution of the coastwise 
trader. "The arts of design," says this preface, 
" are the result of the artistic impulse in man, 
of his disposition to record, to explain, what is 
beautiful in the world of nature, and to refine 
and beautify the work of man. That is enough 
for the artist to know. A lifetime of study and 
thought will not suffice to unfold all the charm 
and all the mystery of that simple creed. . . . 
Artistic beauty lies in light and shade and color : 
artistic interest lies in the skilful combination 
of those simple elements." But artistic truth 
is measured by broader standards ; and to know 
whether the artist is true to his age and environ- 
ment one must know something of the life and 
thought and character of that age as well as the 
superficial aspects of its artistic expression. It 
is a profound subject, of high import to the stu- 
dent of life ; and a history of architecture will 
some day be written in this spirit, but possibly 
not before many another critical history has been 
published. 

The Oriental styles lend themselves to such 
treatment much more readily than do the phases 
of the Romanesque treated in this volume, and 
the author's lesser intimacy with the details of 
Oriental architecture has permitted his thought 
to rim more parallel to the suggested channel. 
Throughout his exposition of the Moslem archi- 
tecture of Persia, India, Egypt, of the architec- 
ture of Japan, China, and southwestern Asia, 
one feels the author's subconscious relating of 
the art to the life and environment of the 
peoples. The chapters on the Romanesque are 
handled very much after the manner of the first 
volume, with thorough understanding and appre- 



ciation, which histories on kindred lines can do 
little more than augment. In the chapters 
on Oriental architecture there is too much 
matter in the text which performs the function 
of the footnote and should be relegated to that 
position. The volume is very attractive in 
its illustrations, typography, and mechanical 
make-up, maintaining the high standard set by 
Volume I. 

The preparation of the third volume is to be 
undertaken by Mr. Arthur L. Frothingham, 
who, receiving his education abroad, has devoted 
his life to the study of architecture and archae- 
ology. With the full notes left by Mr. Sturgis, 
and the thorough sympathy in which Mr. 
Frothingham holds the original author's point 
of view, we may expect the third volume har- 
moniously as well as adequately to round out 
this great work. The history is on so large a 
scale that it would seem that its component 
volumes might well have been brought to more 
dignified conclusion. One turns a page in Vol- 
ume I. expecting a summing up of the Imperial 
Roman period, and finds that the end already 
is reached. The last sentence of Volume II., 
while it relates to certain architectural orna- 
mentation, might apply with equal force to the 
literary form of the history : a great period 
and a great volume are dismissed with a descrip- 
tion of trivial detail. This may seem hyper- 
critical, but the work is of such magnitude and 
of such inherent value that the impression car- 
ried from it should be commensurate with its 
dignity, and undoubtedly Mr. Frothingham 
will take cognizance of this in the literary 
structure of the third and last volume of the 

work - Irving K. Pond. 



An important document from the Temple Library of 
Nippur has been deciphered by Professor Hilprecht, 
the indefatigable archaeologist . From among the tablets 
which he has been the means of disinterring and pre- 
serving, and which are now in the possession of the 
University of Pennsylvania, he has found one contain- 
ing a part of the " Babylon deluge story." It is the 
oldest extant written record of that event, antedating 
the Bible account of the deluge by at least a thousand 
years, and is about fifteen hundred years older than the 
similar fragmentary record from the library of Ashnr- 
banapral. The tablet in question is of unbaked clay, 
measuring nearly three inches in length, somewhat less 
in width, and seven-eighths of an inch thick. Its date 
is assigned by its discoverer as about two thousand B. C. 
A translation of as much as is decipherable in this 
ancient document has been made by Professor Hil- 
precht. It briefly describes the threatened flood, and 
gives a few general directions for the building of a 
" houseboat."

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



Recent Fiction.* 



A novel ten years old is not often remembered at 
all. But those who read "The Gadfly," which was 
published about that number of years ago, not only 
remember it but think of it as a singularly impres- 
sive work. The announcement of a new novel by 
Mrs. Voynich is therefore calculated to arouse more 
than usual anticipations, and the statement that this 
new novel is in some sense a sequel to " The Gadfly " 
is enough to excite the liveliest interest. We say 
" in some sense " because the former novel brought 
the career of its hero to a close, and its successor 
harks back to an adventurous earlier career that was 
previously hinted at, but not disclosed. In " An 
Interrupted Friendship " we come across him as we 
accompany a French geographical expedition to the 
wilds of South America ; and from the time when, 
a seemingly hopeless derelict, he becomes attached 
to the expedition in the character of interpreter, he 
attracts our attention until he becomes the figure of 
central importance in a group of which the other 
members are by no means devoid of interest. His 
enigmatic character, his amazing versatility, and his 
courage in the face of danger, make the men of his 
entourage seem almost coloi"less by comparison, and 
even the ostensible hero of the narrative recedes into 
the background. Thus far we have outlined some- 
thing more than half the story ; the lesser portion 
of it is concerned with the more familiar European 
scene, and ends with an account, sketched rather than 
described, of the Gadfly's career as a French journal- 
ist, and of his ill-fated share in the movement for the 
liberation of Italy. The story is intensely vivid from 
first to last, and grimly tragic as well ; for the author 
has no mind to deal in sentimental consolations, nor 
does she invoke the conventional theory of poetic 
justice. An implacable and savage fate wreaks its 
will upon all the lives that seem best worth saving, 
and the clouds have no suggestion of a blue sky above 
them. But the book grips us, and, despite all its 
racking of our emotions, has the fascination of a true

work of art. Such books offer a salutary corrective 
for the smug self-deception about life that ordinary 
novels tend to develop. 

Miss Ethel Stefana Stevens has given us, in " The 
Veil," an extraordinarily interesting story of the 
intermingled life of Arab and European in French 
North Africa. The scene is Tunis, and the European 
characters are mostly Sicilians. The central figures 
of the book are two natives — a crafty prophet with 
the ambition of a Mahdi, and a beautiful dancing 
woman, his creature and spy, who fascinates us 
from beginning to end of the narrative. Beside 
her, indeed, the Sicilian heroine is a colorless creat- 
ure, although a fair match for the Sicilian hero, who 
is interesting but hardly inspiring. The tale is 
replete with adventure and rich in romantic color- 
ing. It has, moreover, an historical basis in the 
Mohammedan uprising which only two years ago 
sought to wrest the holy city of Kairouan from its 
infidel possessors. 

u The Rosary," by Mrs. Florence M. Barclay, is 
not a novel for the trifling reader, nor for the 
reader desirous of escaping with unwrenched emo- 
tions. The author has created a difficult situation, 
seemingly piling up obstacles for the satisfaction of 
overcoming them, and forcing the reluctant attention 
to become interested in a theme that is almost repel- 
lant. In the first place, she gives us a hero who is 
a gifted young artist and a worshipper of the beauti- 
ful, providing for him a heroine who is several years 
his senior and conspicuously plain of feature. Be- 
neath this exterior, the artist discerns a beauty of 
soul that makes her the one woman in the world for 
him, and he woos her with grave passion. She, 
taken all aback by this unexpected assault upon her 
citadel, is moved to the tenderest affection, but her 
judgment cannot give consent, aud she rejects her 
lover for what she believes to be his own good. 
Then she journeys abroad, and remains away from 
England until she hears that her suitor has been the 
victim of an accident which has left him totally 
blind. Following the dictates of her heart, she 
returns in the hope that she may be helpful ; but the 
man, still deeply wounded in his pride, and wholly 
unaware that the woman had loved him all the 
time, refuses her plea that she may be permitted to 
come to him. She thereupon resorts to the extra- 
ordinary expedient of getting herself sent to him as 
his nurse and attendant, and thus, as a supposed 
stranger, she becomes his intimate companion. The 
deception is successfully carried on for months, and 
the author contrives to convince us, against our will, 
of its possibility. The task then becomes that of 
bringing these two high-strung souls, loyal to each 
other but still more loyal to their ideals, to a true 
understanding. The thing is done, delicately and 
by slow degrees ; and we work up to an emotional 
climax that is simply overwhelming. It is not often 
that a novelist grapples successfully with a self- 
imposed problem so seemingly insoluble, or is able 
to make tolerable and even beautiful the most intol- 
erable of all individual calamities. Mrs. Barclay

has done all this, and in doing it has achieved an 
artistic triumph far out of the common. 

Viscount Mountcastle, son and heir of the Earl of 
St. Vian, becomes engaged, and nearly married, to 
a girl who loves another man. Discovering the facts 
of the situation in the nick of time, he generously 
smooths the way for his rival. Then he determines 
to go out into the world as a plain commoner, and 
find out whether he can find a girl who will love him 
for his own beaux yeux and manly virtues. Possess- 
ing both, he does not look far. He takes quarters 
in a Bloomsbury boarding-house, and there discovers 
a charming American maiden. She is also the child 
of wealthy parents, and so a pretext has to be 
devised for her presence in this modest abode. He 
is fortunate in bis first encounters, and rescues her 
from imminent peril within twenty-four hours of 
their first acquaintance. Then the scene shifts to 
Bruges, whither he follows her, and where he wins her 
heart by his prowess on the tennis-court, defeating 
sundry Belgian champions. Now is the time for 
the blow to fall, and it does so with a vengeance. 
An appeal is made to the girl to save her mother's 
honor by marrying a New York magnate, who holds 
some compromising letters. The daughter tearfully 
consents, and her lover is left plante-la. Thereupon 
he gets busy, discovers the secret, gets on the trail 
of the magnate (then cruising about in his yacht), 
captures the documents by a pretty bit of piracy, 
and sends them to the girl by registered post. The 
rest may be imagined, and the girl does not balk 
even when she learns that her lover is one of the 
proudest peers of the United Kingdom. It is a 
pleasant tale, crisply told, and without too many 
agonies ; a trifling tale, but a vastly entertaining 
one. Its title is u The Man Outside," and it claims 
Mr. Wyndham Martin for its author. 

Mr. J. Storer Clouston is a fantastic humorist of 
the type that " F. Anstey " made us acquainted 
with. His gladsome tale of * k The Prodigal Father " 
tells us how James Heriot Walkinshaw, W.S., the 
crustiest of Scotch solicitors, the very personification 
of glacial dignity and correctness of bearing, found 
himself in failing health, and resorted to a practitioner 
whose methods were justly open to professional sus- 
picion. The treatment given him had for its object 
the defeat of senescence by a restoration of his 
tissues to youthful vigor, and it proves so successful 
that the patient reverses his life, physiologically 
speaking, and grows younger at an alarming rate. 
As the process goes on. his actions become fairly 
scandalizing — he goes to London and plunges into 
a wild whirl of dissipation, he flings money right 
and left, he substitutes directness for circumlocution 
in his business, he makes love to a buxom widow 
and then jilts her as too old for him, and he abets 
the love affairs of his children, to which he had 
formerly opposed an unyielding front. When the 
story of his downward (or upward) career is broken 
off, he is left in a preparatory school where he 
stands first in the batting averages. Mr. Clouston 
tells this story in a vein of dry humor infused with 



sentiment, and to highly entertaining effect. The 
narrative is rich in incidents, most of which are sur- 
prising, and displays a keen sense of character 
despite its fundamentally absurd motive. 

When we first make the acquaintance of John 
Ordham, he is an idler in Munich, twenty-four years 
old. When we leave him, three or four years later, 
he bears one of the proudest titles in England, owns 
vast ancestral estates, and is a rapidly rising star in 
the diplomatic service. The external part of this 
transformation is wrought by the death of his elder 
brother ; the more significant and spiritual part of 
it is the gift of tragic experience. This is the story 
told us in "Tower of Ivory," the latest novel by Mrs. 
Gertrude Atherton. The dea ex machina of Ord- 
ham'8 fate is a woman thirteen years his senior — 
the divine artist whose Brunnhilde and Isolde have 
made her the idol of the Munich populace, and the 
favorite of the melancholy King. In her earlier days 
she had been Peggy Hill of the coal-mines in 
America, and a notorious character in the under- 
world of New York. But this is long since past, and 
we are given to understand that art has so purified and 
ennobled her that, as Margarethe Styr, she is wholly 
worthy of our admiration and of Ordham's love. The 
first meeting takes place in no less romantic a spot 
than Neuschwanstein, whither the artist has been 
commanded by the King for a midnight recital of his 
favorite music. We may here remark that from this 
time on discussion of the music-dramas of Richard 
Wagner occupies as considerable a part of the book 
as it does in the " Evelyn Innes " of Mr. George 
Moore, fulfilling here also the double purpose of being 
interesting as criticism and of revealing the character 
of the heroine. Ordham is admitted to intimate 
friendship with the singer, but their relations are 
irreproachable, and they do not realize what they 
have become to each other until separation has led 
to the self-revelation. The separation, in Ordham's 
case, means a return to England, and a fall into the 
trap set for him by an American heiress and the 
designing relatives on both sides. He thinks he is 
in love, thinks for a time after his marriage that he 
is happy, and then, when he realizes the contrast 
between his small-minded, selfish, and hysterical wife, 
and the true companion of his soul, realizes how fatal 
a mistake he has made. In a mad impulse, he rushes 
away to Munich, to be recalled almost immediately 
by the news of his wife's illness and of their still-born 
child. Soon after his wife's death, the story reaches 
its tragic denouement when the singer, as the only 
means of atonement for her own past, and of saving 
her lover's career from being ruined by a union with 
her, makes her last wild appearance as Brunnhilde, 
and turns the self-immolation in the closing scene of 
" Die Gstterdammerung " into an act of grim reality. 
This is the bare outline of a story which has so many 
of the elements of power that it seems ungrateful to 
speak of its defects. But it must be recorded that 
Mrs. Atherton's style is as stodgy as ever, that her 
passages of analysis and description are terribly long- 
winded, that she has hardly the faintest gleam of 



244

[April 1, 



humor, that her social commentary is too acrid to 
arouse sympathy, and that the garish coloring of 
" Ouida " is irresistibly suggested by her more am- 
bitious pages. These are pretty serious matters, and 
they are all aspects of the artistic crudity out of which 
this strenuous novelist does not seem able to grow. 
Nevertheless, she can be impressive and almost con- 
vincing at times, perhaps never more nearly convinc- 
ing than in the present elaborate setting-forth of the 
play of character under social and artistic pressure. 

The freshness of treatment and the psychological 
insight which characterize "The Florentine Frame," 
by Miss Elizabeth Robins, rather more than offset 
the laxity of its style. The book is at least alive 
with thought, and displays much penetrative obser- 
vation. There are only three characters that count 
the opulent widow who is set apart from the com- 
mon herd, not so much by wealth as by aristocratic 
temperament and refined instincts, her daughter, 
just budding into womanhood, and the young man 
who comes from the South to occupy a post in the 
University, and who develops into a dramatist of 
remarkable gifts. He is drawn with some difficulty 
into the companionship of the two women, becomes 
an intimate of their household, and benefits spiritually 
and materially by the association. His close rela- 
tionship with the older woman resolves itself into 
affection, which would have led to its natural con- 
summation had it not been for the girl, who imagines 
herself to be the object of Keith's worship, and 
ingenuously reveals to him the fact that he has but 
to speak. The mother, meanwhile, when her eyes 
are opened, shares in the daughter's self-deception, 
suppresses her own desires, and furthers the mar- 
riage to which reason points as suitable, although it 
means to her a heart-breaking sacrifice of self. 
This is literally true ; for the wedded couple find 
their honeymoon brought to a sorrowful end by the 
news of the mother's death. Then comes the psy- 
chological climax, for the wife's intuition discovers 
the husband's secret, and she realizes that his heart 
has never been her own. The shock is so severe 
that it changes the face of life for her, and she is 
determined upon separation. In the end, this emo- 
tional tension is relaxed ; Keith's genuine affection 
for his wife triumphs over her wild resolve, and she 
becomes reconciled to the life-bond which she has 
contracted, although the memory of the dead must 
forever dim the radiance of her romance. The title 
of this appealing tale is symbolical, the Florentine 
frame being a real frame, kept tenantless for many 
years by the older woman, because she could not 
find a portrait quite worthy of such a setting. She 
finds it at last, in the form of a Knight of Malta 
photographed from a famous painting — a striking 
anticipation of Keith's features — but the symbol is 
all that destiny has in store for her; the reality is 
framed in the heart of the child for whom her great 
renunciation is made. 

Miss Alice French (" Octave Thanet ") has taken 
to problem novels of recent years, and no less a prob- 
lem than that of the American negro is the theme 



of " By Inheritance," her latest work. But she 
goes about her delicate task very engagingly, and, 
although the problem is suggested in her opening 
chapter, it seems only incidental, and is not brought 
into the forefront of attention until we have become 
interested in a situation of the ordinary human sort, 
and in a group of such characters as the author has 
described many times before. The scheme of her 
story is based upon the transplantation of Miss 
Agatha Danforth from Massachusetts to Arkansas, 
her errand being that of ministering to the needs of 
a fever-stricken nephew. Miss Agatha, who is a 
wealthy spinster, has given much thought to the 
elevation of the negro race, and is imbued with the 
traditional New England idealism. She has known 
the sophisticated negro, and learned to think well of 
him, failing to perceive how fundamentally he is set 
apart in character from the white. When she comes 
to know the negro as the natural man in his Arkansas 
habitat, she suffers numerous severe mental shocks, 
and becomes slowly but completely disillusionized as 
the stern facts confront her. Much of her former 
theorizing is discovered to be thin and fantastic, and 
most of her former efforts are seen to have been 
misdirected. She realizes, among other things, that 
industrial training is much more needed by the negro 
than academic education, and that the " door of hope " 
is more likely than not, when opened to him, to lead 
to an impasse which will prove his ruin. Miss 
French does not pretend to solve the problem of the 
negro's future in this country, but she sees clearly 
certain things about his present status and prospects 
— things which nullify many of the aims of well- 
meaning philanthropy. Seeing these things, she does 
not hesitate to make them clear, and to draw the 
contrast between plausible theory and unyielding 
fact. There is nothing bitter or prejudiced in her 
account of the negro ; she appreciates his good quali- 
ties to the full, and her touch is always generous and 
sympathetic. These remarks have led us away from 
the book in its aspect as a work of entertaining fic- 
tion, and we must not close them without reasserting 
its claim upon the interest of the reader who wishes 
a story and not a problem. He cannot quite avoid 
being made thoughtful now and then, but he is also 
furnished with a moderately exciting plot, and with 
the account of many vivid, dramatic, and human 
happenings. 

There is a homely and wholesome air about the 
Southern novels of Mr. George Cary Eggleston that 
makes them welcome to the over-stimulated sense of 
readers of the kind of fiction now most in vogue. 
They are old-fashioned stories in both matter and 
manner, straightforward narratives in plain black 
and white, eschewing subtleties and problems, but 
developing a sentimental situation with blunt sin- 
cerity. " Irene of the Mountains " is a typical 
example, perhaps a little above the average of its 
predecessors, and we have read it with genuine 
satisfaction. It is the love-story of an untutored 
mountain girl and the scion of an old and aristo- 
cratic family, and the conclusion is happy. Its

scene is Virginia in the fifties or thereabouts, and 
Mr. Eggleston has a rich store of recollections of 
both place and period, from which he draws his 
incidents and constructs his descriptions. 

Mr. Meredith Nicholson, having scaled the heights 
of commercial success and stood upon the peak of 
the M best sellers," seems now to have become am- 
bitious to conquer the more difficult peak which 
signifies artistic success. He has made a consider- 
able ascent upon this slope with the production of 
his "Lords of High Decision," which is a real novel 
of striking qualities, as far as possible removed from 
the romantic comedy of his " Port of Missing Men " 
and his '"Little Brown Jug of Kildare." It is a story 
of Pittsburg, and the " lords " of its title are certain 
financial magnates of that rather begrimed city. 
Colonel Roger Craighill and his son Wayne are the 
central figures among the men, — the former a 
successful captain of industry and willing victim of 
the delusion of his own moral as well as financial 
stature, the latter a typical example of the American 
son of wealthy parents, self-indulgent to the point of 
drunkenness and a generally reckless course of exist- 
ence. Since this youth is to serve as the hero, he 
must be invested with some good qualities, and the 
better self must overcome the worse as his career is 
unfolded. The redeeming influence, of course, must 
be that of a woman, and a suitable heroine is pro- 
vided. We thus have one of the most conventional 
and hackneyed of situations, but Mr. Nicholson con- 
trives to attach to it a sufficient variety of interesting 
incident, and to develop it with vigor and inventive 
skill. In several instances he has given us real 
characters — not symbols or puppets — and has 
invested their relations to one another with an un- 
common degree of human interest. We hope that 
his work will be henceforth continued upon the lines 
of this energetic new departure. 

When Cornelis Doris, a landscape painter by the 
grace of God, permitted a trickster to rob him of his 
just fame, and claim authorship of his inspired works, 
he carried self-abnegation considerably beyond the 
point at which it approves itself to the ethical sense. 
His motive was an overpowering emotion of grati- 
tude for the trickster's wife, to whom from earliest 
childhood he had been bound by the ties of affection. 
It was she who, being several years his senior, had 
watched over his infancy, had encouraged his child- 
ish efforts to paint, had seen the artistic possibilities 
latent in his nature, and had contracted a loveless 
marriage with a man of wealth for the sole purpose 
of being able to provide for the training of her pro- 
tege. All this was cause for gratitude, no doubt, 
but the payment was out of proportion to the debt. 
It is the situation thus described that is developed in 
" The Price of Lis Doris," by " Maarten Maartens." 
The husband in question is a selfish and malicious 
person, an amateur of mediocre talents but eager for 
fame. He displays as his own the masterpieces that 
Lis has painted, and the artist acquiesces in the fraud 
out of love for his benefactress. He agrees, further- 
more, to abandon landscape for portraiture, and in 



that field of activity wins distinction and moneyed 
ease. The tragedy of his renunciation wrecks his 
life, but he keeps the faith, allowing no eyes to see 
the landscapes which he paints for his own secret 
delight. Even after the death of the man who has 
cheated him out of his birthright, he feels bound to 
save the man's reputation for the sake of the wife 
and son, and dies directing the destruction of the 
canvases which would have revealed his secret- It 
makes a moving and tender story, glowing with 
exalted feeling, and quivering with the sense of 
beauty, but its pathos is too unbearable, and one 
cannot justify a sacrifice, however heroically pitched, 
that involves the perpetuation of so base a fraud. 
After the death of Lis, the truth indeed comes out, 
but poetic justice requires that it should have come 
out before. The scene of this story is in the author's 
own land, a village and country scene for the most 
part. It is delightfully intimate in its depiction of 
both nature and life, and in its confidential running 
comment. In this latter respect, it reminds us a 
good deal of Mr. De Morgan, who warms us with 
a similar quality of sunny optimism, and has the 
same power to bring warm tears to our eyes. It is 
not only the principals in this story who deserve 
mention, for the writer's delicate art has drawn for 
us numerous minor figures that are strikingly indi- 
vidual — the gentle and long-suffering dominie, his 
domineering wife, the " religious grocer " who was 
the hero's father, the impecunious drawing-master, 
and several others almost as convincing. This is 
the best book that u Maarten Maartens " has given 
us for many years. WlLLIAM ^ ojaos Patxe .

The story of the successful fight 
% a tte££<!uiu!. whi ch modern science, in the guise 

of preventive medicine, is making 
in the tropics against age-long foes of plague and 
pestilence, and the even more ineradicable enemies, 
not confined to tropics or barbarians, of superstition, 
ignorance, and prejudice, is ably told in Sir Robert 
Boyce's "Mosquito or Man" (Dutton). The author 
is Director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Med 
icine, and as such has shared in and directed numer- 
ous sanitary expeditions to the fever-ridden coasts 
of Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Amazons. 
There is probably no one who is more familiar with 
the conquest of the tropics for modern civilization 
by means of mosquito control, and the prevention of 
diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping 
sickness, by the destruction of the insect carriers of 
their germs, than Dr. Boyce. The book is therefore 
a capital first-hand authoritative account of actual 
practice, and not a second-hand compilation, as are 
most popular books dealing with the subject. Pho- 
tographs of the actual field-work, and copies of police 
and sanitary regulations, as well as summaries of 
methods and results, are freely used to illustrate the

method and progress of the work. The growth of 
sanitation in the tropics and elsewhere in recent 
years, and the obstacles of miasm, tradition, and pre- 
judice, are discussed at length. The method of con- 
duct of an anti-malarial campaign is well elaborated, 
as are also the preventive measures used against 
yellow fever. Much of the illustrative material for 
the latter is drawn from the late New Orleans cam- 
paign. Sleeping sickness, hookworm disease, goats'- 
milk or Malta fever, dengue, plague, leprosy, and 
tuberculosis, are also briefly treated in a popular 
way. The history of the discovery of the secret of 
malaria, and of insect transmission of its germ, is 
related but only partially, for no mention is made 
of the very essential pioneer discoveries of Grassi, 
the Italian zoologist, who shares with Dr. Ross the 
honor of the initial discoveries which have brought 
health to stricken peoples, and are destined ultimately 
to exterminate certain diseases from all habitable 
lands. Dr. Boyce has been most generous in ac- 
cording mention of work in our own land, and in 
Cuba and the Philippines ; but he seems not to have 
heard of the American hookworm ! Doubtless the 
second edition will relate the progress of the com- 
paign against this germ of laziness, and will also 
afford the author an opportunity to eradicate a num- 
ber of complicated and obscure sentences which mar 
an otherwise very readable book, and one of great 
practical interest to all communities where malaria 
lurks or mosquitos sing. 



Echoes of the 0f books called forth h Y the occur - 
Darwinian rence of the centennial anniversary 

centenary. f Darwin's birth, the end appears 

not even yet to be in sight. To the volumes offici- 
ally issued in connection with both the English and 
American commemorative ceremonies, Professor 
Edward B. Poulton was a contributor. By dint of 
reprinting these addresses, and three others given in 
connection with the same events but not printed in 
the official volume, together with an account of the 
celebration of the Darwin centenary at Oxford and 
a few hitherto unpublished Darwin letters, this 
author is able to make a Darwin centenary book, 
" Charles Darwin and the Origin of Species " (Long- 
mans, Green & Co.). Mr. Poulton is an orthodox 
Neo-Darwinist of the most extreme and reactionary 
type. With Wallace, to whom the present volume 
is dedicated, and Weismann, he stands as one of the 
very few who still cling to the fetish of the Allmacht 
of the cumulative selection of minute variations as 
the vera causa of evolution. All the results of the 
analytical and experimental study of the problems 
of evolution, which have made the decade just past 
the most fruitful of new knowledge and new view- 
points in this field of biology of any period since 
Darwin's own work was done, are to Poulton of no 
significance as regards fundamental problems. He 
holds that the "only fundamental changes in the 
doctrine [of evolution] given to us in 1858 and 1859 
are those brought about by the researches and the 



thoughts of Weismann." This, fortunately, is an 
opinion held by but very few people. Three of the 
addresses deal with Darwin's personality, the develop- 
ment of his ideas, and historical matters connected 
with his life. Two have to do with an exposition of 
Mr. Poulton's well-known views as to the origin and 
significance of the coloration of butterflies. The 
nineteen letters to Mr. Roland Trimen, here printed 
for the first time, form an interesting addition to 
existing Darwiniana. Full, as were all Darwin's 
letters, of the most acute and stimulating observa- 
tions and opinions on the scientific matters which 
were under discussion, these also show the extreme 
modesty, genial and cordial anxiety to help others, 
and kindly, quiet humor, which appear through his 
correspondence. The following bit is characteristic : 
" Many thanks for your Photograph, and I send 
mine ; but it is a hideous affair — merely a modi- 
fied, hardly an improved, Gorilla." Four appen- 
dices, dealing with controversial matters, and an 
excellent index, complete the volume. 



Aspects and Sane and sensible, as a rule, and 
contrasts of eminently readable always, are Pro- 

American life. f essor Brander Matthews's occa- 
sional collections of essays on literary, dramatic, 
social, or practical themes. Nearly half a score of 
these attractive volumes have now appeared, the 
latest of which is entitled " The American of the 
Future, and Other Essays" (Scribner). The title 
essay in this collection of fifteen public addresses 
and other utterances is an optimistic forecast of our 
future in respect to our conglomerate but always 
preponderatingly patriotic population. Our ability 
to assimilate the foreigner is now, as it has been in 
the past, something remarkable ; and the so-called 
alien element is proportionately no larger now than 
it has been for more than a century. In a chapter 
contrasting the Americans and the British, Professor 
Matthews calls attention to the Englishman's " habit 
of fighting for his own hand " which has developed 
"a certain hardness," an almost frankly brutal 
manner in word and deed. "The same desire to 
give pain," he remarks, " is visible in the long his- 
tory of British literary criticism, from Gosson's 
' School of Abuse ' to Pope's ' Dunciad,' and from 
the quarterly reviewers of a century ago to the vio- 
lent vulgarity of the Saturday Review to-day." 
Arrogant Dr. Johnson and urbane Benjamin Frank- 
lin, the loudly scornful Carlyle and the courteous 
and gentle Emerson, are offered as contrasting 
examples of the British and the American manner 
of bearing oneself, in life and in letters. Good 
chapters on American humor, the question of the 
theatre, reform and reformers, standards of success, 
and a dozen other topics, are to be found in the 
book. As was to be expected, Simplified Spelling 
comes in for a chapter ; and the author has shown 
the courage of his convictions, and the indulgence 
of his publishers, by spelling in his own wild fashion 
throughout, even when making quotations. He has

also misspelled the middle name of Mr. Alfred 
Russel Wallace, giving it a superfluous I — surely 
not in the interest of simplified spelling. On the 
whole, the hook is rich in thought, and treats of 
timely topics in a scholarly way. 

Wit not too erudite, and fancy not 
™fo 1 fZh"r t 00 ™tous, have joined hands in 

Professor Grant Showerman's hook, 
••With the Professor" (Holt), and they gracefully 
trip it as they go, on the light fantastic toe, through 
three hundred and sixty pages of delightful fooling 
(and some seriousness). Desipere in loco is an 
art of which this incumbent of a Latin Literature 
chair proves himself to be a master. With a reso- 
lute determination not to take himself and his col- 
leagues and his profession too seriously, the author 
disports himself at the Professor's expense through 
twelve sprightly chapters dealing with various aspects 
of college life and of education in general. In the 
opening essay, " A Prelude on Pessimism." he strikes 
the keynote of the book, a sort of cheerful derision, 
or gleeful sarcasm, or good-humored pessimism, 
punctuated (as the cant phrase puts it) with all 
manner of droll conceits, odd quips, and playful 
sallies. But there's many a serious word said in 
all this jest ; and it is so well said, with so apt and 
evidently unstudied employment of classic quotation 
and neat literary allusion, that the lesson of the 
book, so far as it has a lesson, is learned without 
sense of effort or anything but entertainment on the 
reader's part. Occasionally, in the laudable and 
admirably successful endeavor to throw off the pro- 
fessorial manner, the writer goes a little further 
than necessary in making his style familiar and col- 
loquial. Twice in a single chapter he allows himself 
to use the barbarism " enthuse." Could complai- 
sance in a finished classical scholar go beyond that? 
Sometimes, too, he is a bit hackneyed — as in his 
definitions of optimist and pessimist : one seeing 
the doughnut and the other the hole ; one thinking 
all milk cream, and the other all cream milk, etc. If 
he had included the heraldic definition of pessimist 
couchant as one who has lived too long with an 
optimist rampant, he would have added freshness 
to his collection. Most of these chapters have 
already passed muster in various magazines, but 
are still of a breezy quality that revives the fagged 
brain. 

The mure life The . perennially interesting because 
from various persistently baffling question of the 
point* of view. sours i m mortality is debated by nine 
eminent authors in a volume entitled " In After 
Days: Thoughts on the Future Life" (Harper.) 
The several chapters have already appeared in print, 
but their collective issue is welcome. The manner 
of treating this engrossing topic falls, in each 
instance, under one of three general heads. Messrs. 
Howells and Higginson and Mrs. Howe and Mrs. 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward offer consolation to 
the bereaved, giving warmth and persuasiveness to 



their words by the introduction of personal experi- 
ence or personal conviction. Messrs. Henry M. 
Alden and Henry James are philosophical and 
speculative, as is also Signor Guglielmo Ferrero, 
with the addition of historical and literary illustra- 
tion and reference. Dr. William Hanna Thomson 
and Mr. John Bigelow enforce their utterances with 
biblical citations and the vocabulary of devotion, 
Mr. Bigelow also giving abundant evidence of his 
strong Swedenborgianism. Mr. Henry James, writ- 
ing at some length, is as tortuous and subtle and little 
conclusive as his fondest admirers could wish. Curi- 
ously suggestive of his brother's " Will to Believe " 
is the novelist in the following : '' K one acts from 
desire quite as one would from belief, it signifies 
little what name one gives to one's motive. By 
which term action I mean action of the mind, mean 
that I can encourage my consciousness to acquire 
that interest, to live in that elasticity and that afflu- 
ence, which affect me as symptomatic and auspicious. 
I can't do less if I desire, but I should n't be able to 
do more if I believed." Each chapter has prefixed 
the portrait of its author, the volume thus being a 
valuable collection of photographs of two kinds — 
mental and physiognomical. 

Memorial edition The P* 51 ™ 1 f<>U<™™g Meredith's 
of the works of death has naturally been prolific of 
George Meredith. ^^ g}^^ him. Early apprecia- 
tions have been reprinted, reminiscences and anec- 
dotes have been recalled ; we have had introductions 
to his novels, interpretations of his philosophy, 
analyses of his character-study, of his sense of hu- 
mor, of his style. But as all this is only significant 
either as preface or incentive to the reading of 
Meredith himself, so the finest tribute paid him by 
any publisher is the inception, by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons, in connection with his trustees and 
his English publishers, of a sumptuous " Memorial 
Edition " of his works, to be completed in about 
twenty-seven volumes. Two of these, '* Richard 
Feverel" and "The Shaving of Shagpat," have 
already appeared. Fine paper (water-marked with 
the author's initials), large, clear type, and a plain 
and dignified binding of silk cloth, characterize the 
" Memorial Edition." A distinctive feature is the 
illustrations, three or four to a volume, all repro- 
duced in photogravure. These will include scenes 
associated with the novels and poems, houses where 
Meredith lived and wrote, several portraits, and 
reproductions of many of the original illustrations, 
by Millais, Du Maurier, and others, which accom- 
panied the novels and poems when they were first 
published in magazine form. The principal addi- 
tions to the text will be the new novel *' Celt and 
Saxon," and an unfinished comedy " The Senti- 
mentalists" (now being played in London), besides 
incomplete essays and short stories, and, to the 
volumes of poems, some unpublished stanzas for 
u Love in the Valley " and an early draft of " The 
Head of Bran."

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



A collection ^ * s tne sma U Dut significant traits, 

of literary the less-guarded actions, the involun- 

anecdotes. tar y g estures an( J acts Q f 8e lf re _ 

vealment, that most intimately engage our interest 
in the lives of great men and women. The formal 
biographies we read, and are glad to read, as pre- 
serving for us the grand outlines of noble and 
inspiring personalities; but the anecdotal gleanings 
of informal biography have a human flavor and a 
living reality that is often lacking in the studied 
narrative. " Stories of Authors " ( Sturgis & "Wal- 
ton Co.), by Professor Edwin Watts Chubb, is a 
book designed to appeal to the young student and 
to the general reader, and to kindle in the breast 
that spark of literary enthusiasm, of passionate 
attachment to what is best in the world of books, 
which the more laborious manuals commonly fail of 
doing. The book contains seventy-one short chap- 
ters, touching on the characteristics of the great 
English authors from Chaucer to Mr. Kipling, and 
of the great American authors from Benjamin 
Franklin to Eugene Field. "Every article," says 
Professor Chubb in his preface, " has been written, 
selected, or adapted, because of some special value," 
though which of these three methods has been fol- 
lowed in each instance is not always expressly indi- 
cated or otherwise made apparent. In a certain 
sense, the plan of the book is better than its execu- 
tion, inasmuch as the manifest difficulty of finding 
fresh and entertaining as well as authoritative mat- 
ter for each chapter has often made it necessary to 
draw on the standard biographies and reprint what 
is already more or less familiar to the reading 
world. To the young and little read, however, the 
volume should prove interesting and stimulating. 

Legends and Mexico, with traditions both Indian 
folk-lore of the and Spanish, both ecclesiastical and 
City of Mexico, political, and with an unusually large 
class of people among whom folk-tales originate, 
develop, and are perpetuated, is especially rich in 
folk-lore. Mr. Thomas A. Janvier has made a valu- 
able contribution to the treasures of the folk-lorist, 
in his " Legends of the City of Mexico " (Harper.) 
As stories for the general reader, they have been 
subjected to the experimentum cruris by publication 
in a popular magazine. In their present form, as a 
contribution to the scientific collection of folk-tales, 
their value is enhanced by the addition of an intro- 
ductory chapter and an appendix containing explana- 
tory notes. The legends, as Mr. Janvier says in his 
Introduction, have been found, not made, by him; 
and he has been exceedingly happy in the manner 
in which he has presented them to his readers, hav- 
ing taken them down from the lips of one of the 
class which is given to the preservation of folk-tales, 
in the colloquial Mexican-Spanish which is especially 
fitted to be their medium. In his translation of them 
he has preserved the naivete of the Mexican narra- 
tor to a remarkable degree. To one familiar with 
the City of Mexico, the localization of the various 
legends give them a still deeper interest. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Open Court Publishing Co. have just issued a 
translation of Francesco Redi's " Experiments on the 
Generation of Insects," by Miss Mab Bigelow. The 
work of this Jesuit physician, naturalist, and poet is 
interesting from the fact that he was one of the first to 
argue against the popular notion of spontaneous gene- 
ration. The work now translated was published in 1668, 
and it is from the fifth edition (1688) that the present 
translation has been made. 

Mr. Robert Haven Schauffler's series of anthologies 
devoted to the days we celebrate now includes a 
■ Washington's Birthday " volume, made up of essays, 
poems, stories, and bits of historical characterization 
suitable for school exercises. The real rather than the 
mythological Washington is here delineated — "a lov- 
able, fallible, very human personality, with humor, a 
hot temper, and a genuine love of pleasure." Messrs. 
Moffat, Yard & Co. publish the volume. 

Mrs. Florence Jackson Stoddard presents the first 
collection thus far made of the folk-tales of Cuba and 
the West Indies, "As Old as the Moon" (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.) In the first division of the book she gives 
the cosmo-genetic myths of the aborigines; in the sec- 
ond, the folk-tales that originated at the time of the 
advent of the Europeans; and in a third division, the 
folk-tales of the slaves of the later days. These do not 
differ materially from similar tales of the Indians under 
like conditions elsewhere; and what fascination the 
book may have for young readers, for whom it seems 
to be primarily intended, will depend much upon the 
individual taste. But the book will be of value to the 
student of folk-lore and suggestive of a field for further 
and closer investigation. 

No matter how many editions of " The Compleat 
Angler " the lover of that ever-verdant classic may 
have upon his shelves, we can assure him that, if he be 
a proper Waltonite, he must find a way to possess also 
the edition recently produced at the Riverside Press 
under Mr. Bruce Rogers's oversight. In no other mod- 
ern setting that we know of has the fresh and quaint 
flavor of the text been so happily embodied in the typo- 
graphical arrangement and general form. By omitting 
the supererogatory second part by Cotton, it has been 
possible without sacrifice of large type and liberal mar- 
gins to bring the volume into pocket dimensions — 
surely an important consideration in the case of so 
"pocketable" a classic as the "Angler." The wood- 
cuts of fish in the first edition have been worthily 
re-engraved by Mr. Lamont Brown, and there are a 
few appropriate ornaments and initials. Five hundred 
copies only are offered for sale. 

Every scrap of fact relating in any way to Shake- 
speare is of interest, especially when it concerns him so 
intimately as the matter published by Professor C. W. 
Wallace in the March " Harper." No such light is 
thrown upon Shakespeare in the pamphlet before us 
entitled " Globe Theatre Apparel," which Professor 
Wallace has privately printed for presentation only; 
but it brings John Hemynges, the business manager of 
his Company at the Globe, and certain members of the 
Duke of York's Company, into the range of our obser- 
vation. The three legal documents that constitute the 
pamphlet are the papers in a suit brought in 1612 by 
Hemynges to recover £20 from Joseph Taylor of the 
Duke of York's Company, for players' apparel the 



1910.]

latter had got from the former. The dreary dulness 
of these documents gives us some idea of the brain- 
wearying, heart-breaking labor Professor Wallace must 
have done to make his discoveries. 



XOTES. 



An exquisitely printed volume of " Poems by Win- 
throp Mackworth Praed," selected and arranged by Mr. 
Ferris Greenslet, is published by Houghton Mifflin Co. 

A volume on " Governmental Action for Social Wel- 
fare" has been prepared by Professor Jeremiah W. 
Jenks for Macmillan's "American Social Progress 
Series." 

The book upon which the late A. J. Butler was en- 
gaged at the time of his death — " The Forerunner of 
Dante " — was nearly completed, and will be published 
shortly by the Oxford University Press. 

" Tennyson " was the subject chosen by Professor 
William Paton Ker for the Leslie Stephen lecture at 
Oxford last November, and the essay is now published 
in a small volume by the Messrs. Putnam. 

Eight " Indian Speeches " made by Lord Morley 
during the past three years are now collected by the 
Macmillan Co. into a volume, to which is appended an 
important selection of state papers bearing upon the 
same subject. 

A " Handbook to the Works of Dante " is written 
by Mr. F. J. Snell, and published by the Macmillan Co. 
It is a useful little manual, analyzing the works in 
some detail, and containing critical and biographical 
chapters which give us most of the essentials. 

Mr. George Bernard Shaw persistently refuses to let 
the reading public share in the pleasure of seeing his 
new plays. Instead, he will give us this spring a small 
volume entitled " Socialism and Superior Brains," with 
a frontispiece portrait of the author taken by himself. 

A literary statistician calls our attention to the fact 
that out of the three hundred and seventy-five volumes 
(excluding translations) in " Everyman's Library," 
thirty-six, or almost ten per cent, are reprints from 
American authors. This is certainly a creditable show- 
ing for our youthful literature. 

The excellent " Child's Guides " series published by 
the Baker & Taylor Co. has suffered somewhat from 
the limitations of its title ; the books being in fact not 
addressed primarily to children but to amateurs and 
beginners generally. A change of title to " The Guide 
Series " has therefore wisely been decided upon. 

The spring announcements of the Newold Publishing 
Co., Xew York, include " Greece in Evolution," ten 
studies by well-known continental writers, with a preface 
by the Right Hon. Sir Charles W. Dilke; " Irish Song 
Lore," by Mr. James Redfern Mason; "The Garden at 
19," a novel by Mr. Edgar Jepson; and a new work of 
fiction by Mr. Stanley Portal Hyatt, author of " The 
Little Brown Brother." 

" The Shifting and Incidence of Taxation," by Pro- 
fessor Edwin R. A. Seligman, is now published at the 
Columbia University Press in a third edition, consider- 
ably enlarged and in part rewritten. It is eleven years 
since the original publication of the work, and much 
fresh material, especially in connection with municipal 
taxation, and the taxation of instruments of credit, has 
been provided for the investigator. 



Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a library edition 
of " The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin," which 
reproduces the work in its unmutilated form, as it was 
edited and published some thirty years ago by Mr. 
John Bigelow, the owner of the original manuscript. 
An interesting introduction tells how the manuscript 
came into Mr. Bigelow's possession. 

" The Story of Opera," by Mr. E. Markham Lee is a 
new volume in the " Music Story " series, published by 
the Messrs. Scribner. There are many illustrations, 
includmg examples of musical notation. The same 
publishers, in their " Makers of British Art " series, 
send us a biography of Sir J. E. Millais, by Mr. J. 
Eadie Reid, also with many illustrations. 

" The Tramp," a sixpenny monthly addressed to " all 
who are sick of stuffiness in art, life, literature, and 
magazines," has just made its appearance in London. 
An interesting miscellany of articles, stories, and verses 
is contained in the first issue. American lovers of the 
open, as well as their English brethren, should welcome 
this blithe new-comer in the periodical world. 

The " American Addresses at the Second Hague 
Peace Conference," as delivered by Messrs. Joseph H. 
Choate, Horace Porter, and James Brown Scott, are 
now published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. for the Interna- 
tional School of Peace. This volume, dignified in both 
appearance and contents, is edited by Mr. Scott, and is 
a credit to the country, the cause, and the authors. 

The Marquis de la Mazeliere's "Le Japon: Historie 
et Civilisation" (Paris: Plon) is now complete in five 
volumes, the two just received covering the period 
1854—1910. The analytical study of modern Japan 
given us in these concluding volumes is of great value, 
being both precise in statement and intelligent in dis- 
cussion. The volumes have numerous illustrations. 

Gilder memorial fellowships in Columbia University, 
for the promoting of the cause of good citizenship and 
the honoring of an eminent worker in that cause, are to 
be established if the present endeavor to raise a fund 
meets with success. Research in political and social 
science will be pursued by the holders of these fel- 
lowships; and they will have, as incitement to good 
work, the memory of a fine example of civic usefulness. 
It is hoped to raise a fund of a hundred thousand 
dollars. 

A " Life of John Brown of Harper's Ferry," by Mr. 
Oswald Garrison Villard, one of the editors of the New 
York " Evening Post," is announced for early Fall pub- 
lication by the Houghton Mifflin Co. Mr. Villard has 
devoted years to his task, and has made exhaustive ex- 
amination of original documents, contemporary letters, 
and living witnesses, whenever they were to be found, 
utilizing materials never before drawn upon, and dis- 
covering others whose existence has heretofore been 
unknown. 

Among the Spring publications of Messrs. Paul Elder 
& Co. are the following: "By The Way: Pleasant 
Travel Letters with Useful Notes for Tourists," by 
Mrs. Agness Greene Foster; "Obil, Keeper of Camels 
Being the Parable of the Man Whom the Disciples 
Saw Casting Out Devils," by Miss Lucia Chase Bell 
" Friendship : A Mosaic Essay on a Lofty Theme," com- 
piled by Paul Elder, revised edition; "To Friendship 
A Lyric Exaltation of Pure Friendship," by Mrs. 
Agness Greene Foster ; and a new edition of " Quatrains 
of Christ," by Mr. George Creel.

came to this country in 1630, wrote it in reply to various defamatory reports in 
England of the situation in Massachusetts, both in the Church and politics. He 
gives a stronger, clearer picture of New England life in those days than any later 
writer of fact or fiction.

tution, Washington — a descendant of the writer. $3.00 net ; postpaid, $3.30.

AN INTERESTING SOUVENIR OF 
TWO FAMOUS LITERARY MEN 

NEITHER DORKING NOR 
THE ABBEY By j. m. barrie 

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob- 
ably the most appropriate and beautiful was that 
contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
1 ' Neither Dorking nor the Abbey. ' ' That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS. 



Mr. William Winter occupies a unique posi- 
tion among our dramatic reviewers. For nearly 
half a century he has been steadily engaged in 
writing upon the interests of the stage and of 
the actor's profession, and his work has been 
unfailingly characterized by consistency of pur- 
pose and weightiness of expression. He has 
stood for dignity and self-respect, while his 
colleagues, in ever-increasing numbers, have 
deserted to the camp which flaunts the banners 
of frivolity and servility ; he has defended prin- 
ciple against opportunism, and art against com- 
mercialism, with a stout if a saddened heart, 
amid the evil days and the evil tongues on which 
he has fallen in his advancing age. We have 
not always been in sympathy with his particular 
pronouncements, and we think that he has not 
always displayed the open mind — that he has 
found toxic qualities in work that is really tonic ; 
but we have only unstinted admiration for the 
steadfastness with which he has upheld the 
dramatic ideal as he has envisaged it, and only 
gratitude for his lifelong devotion to the things 
which are lovely and of good report. Self- 
respect has compelled him to withdraw his ser- 
vices from the newspaper which for two score 
years honored itself by engaging them ; but for 
this material loss he has for compensation the 
heightened esteem of all those whose approval 
is best worth having, and the knowledge that 
he is loved all the more for the enemies he 
has made. Vbi libertas, ibi patria. He has 
refused to wear the shackles of unprincipled 
journalism, and has won the franchise of the 
great commonwealth of those who seek and 
speak the truth. Incidentally, he has made 
himself one of the foremost among American 
men of letters, a distinction which no time- 
server can ever hope to attain. 

Nevertheless, when we now hear his clear 
ringing accents the voice seems as of one crying 
in the wilderness, so far has the chorus of what 
passes for dramatic criticism retreated from the 
position which he now almost single-handed 
defends. The clamor of flippant vulgarity, the 
chatter that makes novelty its cult, the raucous 
praise bestowed upon every manifestation of 
glittering indecency and the sentimental gloss- 



260 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



ing over of vice, now the sounds most prevalent 
in quarters where things of the stage are dis- 
cussed, have gone far to drown the voice of this 
veteran as it puts forth its plea, now old- 
fashioned enough, for "joy and temperance and 
repose " as the remedies most needed by the 
diseased body dramaturgic. The plea falls upon 
deaf ears, so far has the theatre-going public 
gone in its rake's progress toward an ignoble 
goal, so dulled has its theatrical sense become 
from a diet over-seasoned with unwholesome 
condiments. 

Our text for these remarks is afforded by an 
article contributed to " Harper's Weekly," in 
which Mr. Winter falls foul of the New York 
Theatrical Syndicate and its off endings. He is 
prompted to this deliverance by a defence of 
that organization undertaken by Mr. Charles 
Frohman in a metropolitan newspaper. Mr. 
Frohman has some good things to his credit, and 
is not personally answerable for all the sins of 
the Syndicate ; but in standing as the apologist 
for most of its unconscionable proceedings, he 
makes himself a fair object for attack. After 
all, the man who could decide upon such an 
artistic outrage as that of presenting a woman, 
no matter how estimable and accomplished, and 
a diminutive woman at that, in the titular role 
of " Chantecleer," lays himself open to the im- 
putation that he is capable de tout, like the 
prophet Habakkuk in Voltaire's witty saying. 
And since he defends the methods of the Syndi- 
cate, it is not improper, for the purpose of the 
argument, to lay them upon his shoulders. 

Mr. Winter finds no difficulty in crushing 
" the most active and influential of contemporary 
theatrical managers " beneath the weight of his 
own admissions and sophistical reasonings. The 
claim that William Shakespeare, " more than 
four hundred years ago," was the originator of 
the theatrical " trust," offers a good opening ; 
and the critic could not have asked a better text 
to go on with than is found in the following 
ingenuous words of Mr. Frohman : 

" My impression was that within very recent years 
several men united to systematize the conduct of the 
theatre, put the actor's profession on a self-respecting 
footing, guard the playwright against piracy, protect 
the managers of theatrical companies against unfair 
competion, at the same time obliging them to keep faith 
with managers of theatres." 

Several vulnerable points are noticeable in this 
statement, and Mr. Winter puts his finger upon 
all of them. The impudent plea that one of the 
aims of the Syndicate is to " put the actor's 
profession on a self-respecting footing " arouses 
his hottest indignation, and he draws upon his 



extensive knowledge of theatrical history in 
America to expose the hollow pretence of such 
an assumption. It seems quite clear, on the 
whole, that we had self-respecting actors before 
the days of the palmy present had dawned ; and 
the numerous modern instances of trickery and 
coercion which are adduced seem to indicate 
that Mr. Frohman's notions of what constitutes 
self-respect are curiously inverted. 

The pretence that the Syndicate provides a 
safeguard against unfair competition is almost 
equally hollow and hypocritical. One thinks 
of Mme. Bernhardt playing in circus tents, and 
Mrs. Fiske in shabby second-rate houses, be- 
cause they refused to submit to the insolent 
dictation of the monopolists. One thinks of the 
boycotting tactics practised upon Augustin 
Daly because he rebelled against the tyranny 
of the " closed shop." One thinks of the bull- 
dozing policy which has marked such men as 
Mr. Mantell and Mr. Belasco and Mr. Faver- 
sham for its victims. One thinks of the exclusion 
from the Syndicate theatres of a critic like Mr. 
Metcalfe, and of the deposition from his critical 
post of Mr. Winter himself, for no other offence 
than that of daring to speak the truth and of 
maintaining the right of independent judgment. 
No, the theory of fair and free competition is 
not even specious ; no man knows better than its 
hypocritical proponent that " the Syndicate is 
a despotic, arrogant monopoly, organized and 
conducted for the one purpose, and no other, of 
'cornering the market' in theatrical affairs, 
and gathering wealth for the few speculators 
who have combined to batten on what they call 
public amusements." 

In the matter of the recent flooding of our 
stage by the sewage of vulgarity and indecency, 
Mr. Frohman has nothing less feeble to urge 
than the plea that " what the public wants is 
what they ought to have." We have recently 
discussed this subject on our own account, and 
would gladly re-state, did space permit, using 
Mr. Winter's own words of indignant repu- 
diation, the only view of the matter that has 
anything to do with ethical principle. Our 
critic's reductio ad absurdum of the shameful 
proposition is elaborate, vigorous, and pictur- 
esque. In more general terms, the only belief 
possible to a man who does not flout the very 
idea of the individual's responsibility for his 
acts is formulated by Mr. Winter in a statement 
that could not well be finer or more impressive. 

" When a man assumes to employ any one of the fine 
arts as a means of ' doing business,' he is, likewise, 
undertaking — whether he knows it or not, and whether

he intends it or not — to mould and guide the public 
taste, to influence the direction of the public thought, 
and to affect the condition of the public morals: ac- 
cordingly, such a man therein assumes a responsibility 
much higher, much more serious, than that which is 
incurred in the adoption of any strictly and exclusively 
business pursuit: and, while the obligations of honor and 
honesty rest with equal weight upon all workers, in all 
branches of human industry, those obligations are inex- 
orable and peculiarly sacred in the ministration of 
intellectual, moral, and spiritual forces. It is one thing 
to deal in dry-goods and groceries; it is another and 
vastly different thing to deal in the dissemination of 
thoughts and feelings." 

Turning back to our Ruskin, we find the same 
doctrine expounded with the same earnest con- 
viction : u It is physically impossible for a well- 
educated, intelligent, or brave man to make 
money the chief object of his thoughts." With 
all such men " their work is first, their fee sec- 
ond — very important always, but still second." 
Our theatrical interests can never be safe unless 
they are in the hands of men who are prepared 
to accept this principle with all its implications. 



OSCAR WILDE'S PLACE IN 
LITERATURE. 



After a decade of noisy oblivion, the writings of 
Oscar Wilde have received the recognition of a 
definitive edition, worthy as to form and complete 
in contents.* No longer need we contend with the 
pornographic stock-broker at the book-auction, or 
shake our heads over the excessive prices of items 
listed in the catalogues under the dreadful caption 
of Oscariana. However, no one but the collector 
will complain that Wilde is no longer a rarity. 
Now at last we can fight in the light : we may 
" adopt an attitude," to use a phrase of Wilde's own, 
toward a definitely presented literary talent ; and 
even the apologists who plead that Villon was a 
rascal and Shakespeare a poacher, may judge 
whether or not we shall forget that the " apostle of 
the English Renaissance " was an improper person. 

Will Wilde survive? The answer lies in these 
substantial volumes ; the evidence is all in, though 
it may be over-early to discuss it. What strikes 
one first is the range of the writings : there are 
plays, novels, poems, essays, art-criticism, book- 

* This edition was planned and published some two years 
ago by the English firm of Methuen & Co.. with the authori- 
zation and cooperation of Wilde's literary executor, Mr. 
Robert Ross. The set comprised fourteen volumes, beauti- 
fully printed on hand-made paper, the edition being limited 
to a thousand copies. Bv arrangement with the English 
publishers. Messrs. John W. Luce & Co. of Boston have 
used the plates of this edition for an American reprint, much 
less expensive in price, but naturally also less attractive in 
paper, presswork, and binding. Besides their limited idition 
de luxe, referred to above. Messrs. Methuen have within the 
past few months completed a popular-priced library edition 
of Wilde's works, printed from new plates, and issued in 
twelve volumes ; this, however, does not contain all of the 
matter presented in the limited edition. 



reviews, and autobiography ; nothing is lacking but 
history and the " miscellaneous divinity " of the old- 
book stores! Wilde preferred making history to 
writing it (we are still trying to forget the lily !); 
and if he worshipped Pater's style, he did not care 
in the least for patristic literature. Here, therefore, 
we must content ourselves with the Pre-Raphaelite 
lyrics, filled with aesthetic religiosity as the poems 
of Dante Gabriel Rossetti : charming decorative 
pieces surely, but insincere in spirit as most of our 
modern cathedral glass. Mediaeval feeling, after aU, 
can hardly be reproduced in a copy of a copy. 

Rossetti is but one of Wilde's literary models ; 
every great poet of the Victorian age finds a second 
immortality in his verses. They pass before us in 
" The Garden of Eros " — Keats, Shelley, Swin- 
burne, Morris, and the poet-painter himself. But if 
we add to these self-confessed mentors most of the 
other great English poets, and to these Homer and 
the Greeks, and Dante, and a few of the lyrists of 
France, we shall get a better idea of the range of 
his reading and the strength of his memory. No 
academic ear is needed to detect this ; echo follows 
echo as in a musical comedy. " The true artist is 
known," said Wilde in one of his reviews, " by the 
use he makes of what he annexes ; and he annexes 
everything." So our poet modestly lived up to his 
maxim, aware that in literature at least there is no 
Monroe Doctrine. Had not Moliere said, before 
him, ''Je prends mon bien ou je le trouve"? Like 
Moliere, we are all plagiarists — though hardly, per- 
haps, with such an excuse ; and some Elysian day, 
when all but the scholars have ceased to read the 
classics, judicious plagiarism may become a literary 
virtue, supported by a socialistic culture and justified 
by the pedagogic theories of Rousseau. 

So perhaps might Wilde have justified his imita- 
tions. But his plagiarism was of the old-fashioned 
sturdier sort, like Shakespeare's or Moliere's. He 
copied from other poets, hoping, as all plagiarists 
hope, that in the course of time others might copy 
him. He copied himself, to show that he was not 
unworthy of the compliment. Did not Homer re- 
peat his adjectives, his similes ? So in these books 
the best refuses to be hidden, and telling epithets, 
aphorisms, and puns reappear like comets in the 
cosmic life. Over a score of the epigrams in "A 
Woman of No Importance " are taken from " Dorian 
Gray." Like the bird in Browning's verses, Wilde 
" Sings each song twice over, 

Lest you should think he never could recapture 

The first fine careless rapture." 

One cannot see how much of the early verse can 
survive. We soon tire of hydromel, and a Keats 
devoid of genius becomes the most dreadful of lit- 
erary diets. Alas for Wilde ! he feasted too long 
on ambrosia, and drank too deeply of his "poppy- 
seeded wine." To read his verse at all is cloying, 
and to read much of it is like a literary debauch. 
The best things are the Sonnets, in which the 
imagery is definitely limited by the form : there at 
least the reader is sure of one thought for every

fourteen lines. Next to these come, not the " Pagan " 
verses, far too morbidly romantic to be Greek, but 
the pastel-like pictures inspired by Gautier, some of 
which have all the delicate impressionism of Emaux 
et CamSes. What could be better in its way than 
this: 

"la fuite db la lune. 

" To outer senses there is peace, 
A dreamy peace on either hand, 
Deep silence in the shadowy land, 
Deep silence where the shadows cease. 

" Save for a cry that echoes shrill 

From some lone bird disconsolate ; 
A corncrake calling to its mate ; 
The answer from the misty hill. 

" And suddenly the moon withdraws 

Her sickle from the lightening skies, 
And to her sombre cavern flies, 
Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze." 

No minor poet in England ever attained a more 
thorough mastery of technique than Wilde : we see 
it in the sonnets, as nearly perfect in construction 
as the study of Milton could make them ; we see it 
pushed to the extreme of I'art pour I'art in that bit 
of Byzantine mosaic, " The Sphinx." Yet of these 
early poems none are to be found in the anthologies 
save "Ave Imperatrix," which alone catches a 
breath of national feeling in an adequate chord. 
Most of them, to be sure, are esoteric ; when we 
read them we wonder what is the matter, but when 
we have read them we conclude that there is n't 
any. Never did Wilde conform more closely to his 
maxim, " Youth is rarely original." 

" The Ballad of Reading Gaol " was written 
fifteen years later. We all remember how it was re- 
ceived ; we remember — alas ! — how it was compared 
to " The Ancient Mariner." Such judgments show 
the evils of literary journalism : they indicate that 
the critic has had no time to read Coleridge since 
his college days. " Reading Gaol " has more limp- 
leather editions to its credit in the department 
stores, — but where in Wilde's ballad do we find 
anything like the conception, the imaginative power, 
and the classic simplicity of " The Ancient Mariner," 
whose every sentence is as full of meaning as the 
etcher's line ? " Reading Gaol " does recall Cole- 
ridge, as " Charmides " recalls something of Keats ; 
but the first poem is too brutal, the second too deli- 
cately indelicate, to carry out the comparison 
invited by occasional imitative lines. No realism, 
however poignant, can match the serene imaginative 
reality of the earlier poem ; we want no paradoxes 
in the ballad, we want no ballad so artistic as to be 
artificial. And, after all, Wilde never forgets that 
the important thing in his poem is the manner. 

The tyranny of technique is Wilde's real prison- 
wall. If art is not able to efface itself — ars est 
celare artem — better to write without regard for 
style than use the diction of " The Decay of Lying." 
Such prose makes one think that it is possible for 
an artist to be too articulate. "The world was 
created," said Stephane Mallarme', " in order to lead 



up to a fine book." For Wilde, apparently, the 
cosmic processes led up to the paradox. "Pen, 
Pencil, and Poison" was built around an epigram, 
and " The Model Millionaire " was written for the 
sake of a pun. " Paradoxy is my doxy " is the 
basis of his artistic creed ; and the principle of his 
method is simple contrariety. For example : 

" After the death of her third husband her hair turned 
quite gold from grief." 

" We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and 
thinks too much to be beautiful." 

What could be simpler than the modus operandi? 
Yet each of these phrases occurs three times in the 
volumes before us, with many another gem of rare 
and recurrent wit. Surely Wilde knew that the 
best of paradoxes will scarce bear repetition, and 
that the wittiest of epigrams loses its flavor when 
it becomes a refrain. 

The least affected of Wilde's prose is to be found 
in the journalistic criticism which fills a volume and 
a half of the collected works ; book-reviews of purely 
ephemeral interest, yet written with sprightly grace 
and wit, and full of literary judgments which will 
be turned against their author — when our would-be 
doctors fall upon the difference between Wilde's 
preaching and his practice! And to reward their la- 
bors, they will find some charming " purple patches "; 
the best of these were afterwards worked into the 
pages of " Intentions." Wilde might have become 
a critic of importance, had it been given him to out- 
grow his paradoxes and to chasten his style. He 
had a nice appreciation of all the arts, and a sense of 
the melodic possibilities of language that puts his best 
work beside that of Pater ; and, unlike Pater, he never 
falls from music to mosaic. Truly, " Intentions " 
is a delightful book, — but how far below Pater, if we 
consider it as a collection of essays ! How far below 
Landor in its management of the dialogue form! 
Wilde's adversary is always the man of straw ; there 
is none of the play of personality, the contrast of 
opposite standpoints, that we find in such books as 
Mallock's " New Republic." Wilde could not project 
himself into the intellectual life of another. 

This is the fault of all his work. The very types 
in his plays, excepting those that call for a mere 
surface characterization, are at heart merely dra- 
matic phases of the moods or poses of their author. 
He gives them emotions, but not minds or characters ; 
he makes them real by their repartee. They are 
puppets animated by puns ; they bedazzle our judg- 
ment with a pyrotechnic shower of epigrams. We 
are carried away by it all, but we are left nothing 
which we can carry away. The aesthetic "katharsis " 
of his dramatic theories is lost sight of; we must 
purge our souls with paradoxes, and in improper 
situations make them clean. After all, the charac- 
ters of these plays are not characters, for all they 
have the tone of good society. They are sometimes 
society men and women, but more often only marion- 
ettes with manners. 

Marionettes, too, are the men and women of 
" Dorian Gray." Lord Henry Wotton, brilliant,

autobiographic, the monocled Mephisto of an inef- 
fectual Faust, may alone be said to live, and at 
times tbe reader finds him more lively than alive. 
Dorian simply doesn't exist; he has sold his con- 
science for an eternal youth, — and what man can 
exist without a conscience ? Sybil Vane is a shadow, 
and the painter Hallward the shadow of a shade. 
He is never so living as when he is slain, and his 
corpse sits sprawling in the dreadful attic. Only a 
few of the minor characters, sketched in, like the 
unctuous Jew of the theatre, with broad realistic 
touches, may be said to live even as properties. 
No, " Dorian Gray " is a good subject spoiled. One 
can imagine how Flaubert would have told the 
story, how Balzac would have filled it with fiery- 
colored life. Yet some have compared this novel 
to La Peati de Chagrin! 

The shorter stories need not detain us ; they are 
less real than the fairy-tales. We turn with pleasure 
to " The Happy Prince " and " The House of 
Pomegranates," — for the luxuriance that cloys in 
the poems becomes delightful when submitted to 
the partial restraint of a poetic prose. No one, of 
course, would go to Oscar Wilde for the trenchant 
simplicity of the German folk-tale. His are merely 
artistic apologues, touching life with the light satire 
of the drawing-room. One forgets their author, 
excepting when he is sticking pins into his puppets 
to create an artistic pathos ; only then do we rebel. 
However, Wilde did not take his heroes seriously, 
nor need we. Let us be thankful that he does not, 
that he drags in no pompous moral, for without it 
these fables have all the honesty of the frankly 
artificial, and in their very slightness of texture lies 
the secret of their charm. 

The case is the same with the plays. The best 
of the comedies have a sort of frivolous unity ; they 
are often terribly affected, but they never affect a 
moral. Sincerity makes Wilde inconsistent with his 
art ; he becomes impossible when he assumes a pur- 
pose, and intolerable when he has a paradox to 
prove. Could anything be worse than the essay on 
Socialism ? But no problems spoil his plays, and 
when we find that the least serious of them is 
incomparably the best, the inference is easy. He 
felt too much the charm of his material ; he found 
it easier to play with constructions than to construct 
a play. As a follower of Vart pour 1'art, a purpose 
would spoil him, and he admitted sincerity only in 
his attitude toward aesthetics. Yet the value of a 
fundamental seriousness is nowhere more apparent 
than in the superiority of his art-lectures to such 
work as " Pen, Pencil, and Poison." 

The final necessity of subduing style and spirit 
in a deeper unity is shown in " De Profundis." 
Reading Gaol, and not Oxford, gave us the final 
development of Wilde's prose. It is said that 
prisons make men liars ; but it was none the less a 
prison that made " De Profundis " sincere. Here 
first his art attains its final unity, — a unity of spirit 
and form which puts certain pages of his confession 
almost beyond criticism. All of his early work, in 



comparison, seems little more than a promise ; for 
here alone he attains the simplicity of great art. 

When we add to this its value as a " document," 
we cannot doubt that "De Profundis" will survive. 
It is a pity that this is all we can be sure of. But 
" The Ballad of Reading Gaol " contains too much 
alloy ; if it becomes a classic our classics will have 
lived. The art-criticism, the aesthetic " philosophy," 
will be stolen and rewritten, as it was originally 
stolen and rewritten by Wilde. The life of the plays 
is limited by the life of their paradoxes, as we can see 
from the puns in Shakespeare ; and even the fairy 
tales need more human nature to keep them alive. 
Wilde's place in literature, in so far as he concerns 
us, is that of a precursor : he prepared the way for 
Shaw's paradoxes, and the success of Chesterton is 
to be laid at his door. He revealed to us a certain 
kind of wit, but he has made some of our critics tre- 
mendously trifling. Everything considered, Wilde's 
literary executors would have done better to give us 
a selection from his works — a careful selection, with 
all the cheapest epigrams expunged. Not even a 
reviewer can read a dozen volumes of this sort with 



impunity

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Centres of book-buying activity, as of activity 
in general, are more numerous in northern than in 
southern countries. Norway and Sweden buy and 
read more books than do Spain and Italy. Minnesota 
is more intellectually alert than Mississippi. The 
London correspondent of the New York " Times," 
after some study of the British book-market, con- 
trasts the northern and southern sections of the 
Kingdom, much to the advantage of the former. 
" It is when you get to the bracing north," he says, 
" that you find book-buying England in vigorous 
being." London, of course, is a great literary centre; 
but in proportion to its immense population it is a 
small book-buyer. Dr. Johnson affirmed that the 
high road to England and London was the fairest 
sight a Scotchman could look upon ; but the road 
leading from England to Scotland is now one of the 
fairest to the view of an Englishman with books to 
sell. For no country of so small a population and so 
modest resources equals Scotland as a book-buyer. 
It is claimed, indeed, that she buys and reads more 
books per capita than any other country, " not even 
excepting America " — a country that is confessedly 
very self-denying in the purchase of books. " Just 
walk along famous Princes Street of Edinburgh," 
proceeds our authority, " and notice the number of 
bright, busy book-shops. Every other person you 
meet is carrying a book to or from one of those 
shops and libraries, and the whole sight is grateful 
and comforting." And it is the best books, too, that 
the Edinburgh folk buy, with a pardonable prefer- 
ence for her own famous sons, such as Scott and 
Stevenson. " The third old university town of Scot-

land, Aberdeen, buys books with every penny she 
can spare ; for up there literature is pursued even 
if it has to be on a little oatmeal. . . . Book-buying 
is part and parcel of the economy of a Scottish 
household, and be they ever so poor Scottish people 
are educated. They have been for centuries, which 
is what makes Scotland literary, and, the Scots 
would probably declare, liberal in politics, meaning 
progressive." It is certainly in accordance with the 
fitness of things that the best books should find their 
best market in the country that has produced one 
of the greatest British poets, the greatest British 
romancer, and the most forceful and original of 

British prose-writers. 

• • • 

The poetic inspiration of the simple life, 
as contrasted with the thronging and often unwhole- 
some suggestions of modern metropolitan existence, 
is hardly open to serious dispute. The question 
whether poets have themselves generally preferred 
to live the simple life as well as to sing it, is not 
quite so easy to decide. The London " Times," the 
English poet laureate, and Mr. Clement K. Shorter, 
editor of " The Sphere," have recently been engaged 
in a newspaper debate of this question. "The 
Times," in a well-written editorial on " The Fiction 
of the Simple Life," provoked the discussion, by 
venturing to affirm that despite all the pretty things 
said of the country by the poets, most of the poets 
have been only too glad to enjoy the comforts and 
amusements of urban life, Wordsworth standing out 
as a conspicuous exception. Mr. Alfred Austin made 
a vigorous rejoinder to this, but based his argument 
chiefly on the many and undisputed references in 
the poets to things rural and pastoral. " The Times " 
replied, and Mr. Shorter also wrote to that journal 
a letter of vehement dissent from Mr. Austin's opin- 
ions, saying truly that u it is not so much a question 
of what poets have written about the simple country 
life as of how far they have cared to endure it." 
Attention might be called also to the queer procliv- 
ity of literary persons to write, or at least to wish 
to write, about what they know nothing of from 
experience. The most entrancing stories of domestic 
bliss are often written by unmarried or unhappily- 
married men and women ; the hall-bedroom boarder 
contributes society gossip and notes on the doings of 
the Four Hundred to the daily newspaper ; and tales 
of horror and carnage and awful crime come from 
the pens of timid maidens and pale-faced young men. 

The passing of a noted naturalist and a 
distinguished contributor to the literature of natural 
science is noted with regret in the sudden death, 
March 28, of Professor Alexander Agassiz, at the 
age of seventy-five. Gifted son of a gifted father, 
he shone not only as an original investigator in that 
father's domain of science, but also as a mining 
engineer and a remarkably able man of business. 
His work at Harvard, where he stepped into Louis 
Agassiz's shoes without getting lost in them, and 
where he built up a great museum of comparative 



zoology and made the university his pecuniary 
debtor to the extent of half a million dollars, is well 
known. His success as superintendent and then 
president of the Calumet and Hecla mines is to be 
read in the astonishing rise of Calumet and Hecla 
stock from next to nothing until it is now quoted at 
six hundred dollars a share. The elder Agassiz 
used to declare, when invited to turn his scientific 
knowledge to his own and others' pecuniary account, 
that he had no time to waste in money-making. 
The son found time to make money and to spend 
it beneficently, besides continuing his special re- 
searches in his favorite branches of science. His 
original and unostentatious ways of giving were in 
marked contrast with the methods pursued by some 
other public benefactors. When, six years ago, 
he was offered $75,000 for conducting some deep- 
sea soundings in the Pacific, on condition that 
the enterprise should be known as the Carnegie- 
Agassiz Expedition, he promptly declined the offer 
and found money elsewhere — chiefly in his own 
pocket. The life of such a man is full of inspiration 
to others ; and it is to be hoped that a worthy biog- 
raphy of Alexander Agassiz may in due time be 
forthcoming. 

A master of sane thinking, and a living expo- 
nent of that rational conduct that grows naturally 
and inevitably out of such modes of thought, has 
passed away with the death, early this month, of 
Professor Borden Parker Bowne, of Boston Uni- 
versity. With a sure perception of things funda- 
mental and essential, and an impatience with all that 
is in the nature of superfluous ornament, Dr. Bowne 
was a power in the lecture-room and also a deeply 
impressive and strongly convincing writer. His 
numerous writings on philosophical and theistic 
subjects have had a reading not confined to English- 
speaking lands, some of his works having enjoyed 
the distinction of translation into other tongues. 
" The Philosophy of Theism " and " The Immanence 
of God " may be mentioned as among his best-known 
works. What was perhaps his last published utter- 
ance, "The Present Status of the Argument for 
Life after Death," in the January " North American 
Review," was remarkable for its scholarly clearness 
and its combined hopefulness of outlook and sober 
restraint. Probably no one of his books ever attained 
a large circulation, but he had appreciative readers 
who will lament his death in what may be regarded 
as the very prime ©f an intellectual worker's life. 
He was but little over sixty-three when he died.

The final disposal of Gibbon's library is

fessor James W. Thompson, of Chicago University. 
" Beckford, the author of ' Vathek,' " writes Mr.

[Gibbon's books] for £950 — ' to have something to 
read when I passed through Lausanne,' he says. ' I 
shut myself up for six weeks from early in the morn- 
ing until night, only now and then taking a ride.

The people thought me mad. I read myself nearly

appendix to George Birkbeck Hill's edition of Gib- 
bon's 'Memoirs,' p. 339, Dr. Sch6ll sold half of it to 
an Englishman named Halliday, living in Switzer- 
land, who, in 1876, gave it to a gentleman in Geneva. 
* The other half,' according to Mr. Hill, ' was dis- 
persed by sale, 500 volumes going to an American 
University.' " The writer of the letter wishes the 
name of the university referred to by Dr. Hill. If 
the alleged transfer of books actually took place, it 
ought to be somewhat easier than finding a needle 
in a haystack to trace them to their present resting- 
place ; and if the historian of the Roman Empire 
was a margin-scribbler, it might, as Professor 
Thompson observes, be interesting to not* his

Uxited States presidents en - fiction number 
considerably fewer than twenty-six, the full tale of

thus far proved the most picturesque figures for 
romance ; while such types as Polk, Pierce, Buch- ,

romance. Some such honor, however, has now been i 
paid to him who will not improbably be found by \ 
future novelists to be one of the most popularly 
interesting of our chief magistrates. In "The 
Angel of Lonesome Hill," by Mr. Frederick Landis, 
in the March u Scribner's Magazine," we have our 
famous exponent of the strenuous life, the conquering ] 
hero of African jungles and disturber of the calm of 
papal Rome, our energetic and versatile ex-President, 
figuring anonymously but unmistakably as a leading 
character. It would not be rash to predict that this 
will not be his last appearance in romance. But it 
probably has never before fallen to the lot of man, 
whether high or low in station, to be at once the star 
contributor to, and a fictitious character in, the same

Paul Revere's lanterns — or, rather, the lan-

with an undying light. It would be a pity now to 
have them extinguished by some prosaic-minded 
antiquary or unscrupulously scrupulous historian. 
Hence our pleasure in reading the following from 
the present sexton of the church in question. It is 
addressed to the editor of the Boston M Transcript," 
and is dated March 25. " My attention has just 
been called to an article recently published in your 
paper in which allusion is made to a statement in a 
Chicago paper to the effect that I had on some recent 
occasion expressed a doubt that the signal lanterns 
of Paul Revere were displayed on the tower of the 



old Church in Salem street- Kindly allow me to 
state I have never expressed any such doubt, and 
that I have the fullest confidence in the old tradi- 
tion. I do not see how any one who has gone into 
the matter impartially could entertain any other 
opinion. James J. Rudd, Sexton." Long may Mr. 
Rudd live to keep those lanterns trimmed and burn- 
ing in the poetry of patriotism ! 

A Hale memorial project was made public on 
the first Sunday of this month from the pulpit of 
Dr. Hale's church, the South Congregational in Bos- 
ton. The subject of a memorial to Edward Everett 
Hale has been already touched upon in these columns, 
and though the preservation of his late Roxbury 
residence, with its fine and characteristic library, as 
an inspiring memento of the famous philanthropist 
and author, seems now not likely to be the form that 
the memorial will take, it is gratifying to note that 
a thoroughly worthy and also useful plan of per- 
petuating his memory is at present under discussion. 
A great general "meeting-house," in even more than 
the old New England sense of that word, is advo- 
cated ; and it would be devoted to the welfare of the 
people at large, of whatever denomination, and to the 
promotion of all sorts of good works. The scheme 
is one that Dr. Hale himself, who labored for church 
unity, would have heartily approved.

The inter-library circulation of books 
shows every year an encouraging increase. The 
ideal system of inter-library loans would enable any 
card-holder of any public library to obtain any book 
(allowed to circulate) from any public library in

gressional Library is receiving and answering more 
and more calls upon its great collection, as are 
probably all the larger libraries of the country. The 
Newberry Library, of Chicago, reports for the past 
year the loan of seventy-three volumes to sixteen 
institutions — for the use of private applicants, we 
assume. A Public Library trust, as proposed by 
the late librarian of Columbia University, is not 
exactly to be desired ; but a confederation for mu- 
tual service, such as now practically exists, is a 
gratifying development

THE CHARM OF MRS. HUMPHRY WARD'S NOVELS 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
I have just been reading in your issue of April 1 the 
remarks of Professor E. E. Hale, Jr., on Mrs. Humphry 
Ward, in his review of Professor Phelps's recent book 
of " Essays on Modern Novelists." One may agree 
with Professor Hale's main contention, and yet think 
him rather wide of the mark when he makes technique 
account for the vogue of Mrs. Ward. The immediate 
hold of her novel may, it is true, be dependent upon 
the skill with which she puts together her story; but, 
although I am no great admirer of Mrs. Ward, I find 
that what holds me to her books, even over considerable 



266

[April 16, 



sandy tracts, is the desire to discover what is coming 
next. Yet although this might lead one to read one of 
her stories to the end, it would not account for the 
desire to take up another. For that kind of interest, 
we must look to the substance of the story. And I 
think in this matter the common judgment is to be 
trusted. To put the matter briefly, it seems to me that 
what Mrs. Ward has for us is a sort of gentlewomanly 
morbidity that suits a large public in these days of 
analysis and psychology. Book after book exhibits this 
characteristic, as life is disclosed, first in one aspect, 
then in another, — through Robert Elsmere in the field 
of religion; Marcella in the field of politics and toil; 
William Ashe in a study of politics and the family; 
Diana and Lady Rose in the workings of heredity and 
environment. This gentlewomanly morbidity involves, 
it seems to me, both the material of melodrama and 
the method of analysis. The melodrama explains the 
story interest, the analysis the feeling of self-approval 
with which the would-be serious-minded readers excuse 
their indulgence in fiction. Only one of Mrs. Ward's 
novels (I have not read them all, and have really 
studied none, so that my judgment is of the impres- 
sionistic sort) leaves with me the sense of vital passion 
— " David Grieve "; and one, " Sir George Tressady," 
is so flagrantly melodramatic in its conclusion that it 
has failed, I believe, of the popularity that has attended 
the others. At least I have never heard the book com- 
mended. The popularity of " Eleanor " I do not find 
accounted for by the explanation given above ; at least 
to me the analysis was so in excess of the story that 
after a few chapters I was put to sleep and never woke 
up to resume the story and find out what happened.

"WHO'S WHO IN THE WORLD." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

There is no question that there is a place for a bio- 
graphical dictionary which will give in one volume concise 
information about the living notables in all the leading 
nations of the globe. The original English " Who 's 
Who " pretends to an international character ; but it is 
only a pretense, and a very flimsy one. Since this lack is 
felt, it is unfortunate that the publication which has 
just appeared in London, under the editorship of a gen- 
tleman with the highly floral appellation of Hyacinthe 
Ringrose, fails so signally to supply the need. 

The " International Who 's Who " seems to have had 
an immense deal of trouble getting itself issued Its 
compiler set out to employ a very easy and effective 
method, — namely, to cull a list of biographies from the 
English " Who 's Who," the pioneer of all; the French 
"Qui Etes-Vous?" the German " Wer Ist's," the 
"Italian "Chi E?" and our own "Who's Who in 
America." He was so indiscreet, however, as to men- 
tion in a circular letter, sent out in order to collect 
information, that he intended to use data published by 
these other works; and his forgetfulness of the fact 
that the national volumes were protected by copyright 
brought down upon his head — from the American 
publishers at least — such a volley of commination as 
convinced him of the necessity of finding a different 
method. 

Checked by the threat of prosecution for infringe- 
ment of copyright, the enterprising London editor at 
once dispatched another circular letter, informing the 



notables that each must send him a complete biogra- 
phical statement couched in different language from 
that employed in the American volume. But the 
notables were annoyed. " Who 's Who in America " is 
a responsible and influential publication, and its fulmina- 
tions had had their effect. A large number of the 
Americans addressed failed to respond, especially as 
the request was accompanied by a very frank assur- 
ance that a remittance of five dollars must be forth- 
coming in order to secure mention. The worst feature 
of the English compiler's method is that the eagerness 
of response is in exactly inverse proportion to the real 
importance of him who is to respond. Mr. Job Johnson 
of Turkey Center is very ready to exchange a five-dollar 
bill for a scrap of biography; but Mr. William Dean 
Howells does not rate a scrap of biography so highly. 
Thus it comes about that the name of William Dean 
Howells does not appear in the " International Who's 
Who," but that Job Johnson of Turkey Center is there 
in all his glory. 

Aside from its defects of method, the work is unfor- 
tunate in execution. The proof-reading is execrable. 
Some of the notables will never recognize their names. 
Dozens of Americans will find the city of their residence 
given, but the state omitted. The French section is a 
chaos of misplaced or omitted accents and meaningless 
jumbles of letters; and the German and Italian sections 
are scarcely more accurate. One might venture the 
guess that the whole volume was corrected by an English 
reader with no language but English and a very limited 
knowledge of geography. The biographies seem to have 
been printed in just the helter-skelter, loquacious fashion 
in which the subjects sent them in; so that no two give 
exactly the same sort of information. There is no at- 
tempt at a table of contents or an alphabetical index; 
and as some of the names occur in most unexpected sur- 
roundings, there is no way of telling whether a name is 
there except by looking through the entire volume for 
it. The book, in short, is little more than worthless in 
its present form. It is to be hoped that the editor and 
publishers may find a more practicable working method 
for completing what might prove to be a useful volume, 
or that some one else may take up the task and do what 
they have failed to do. r oy Temple House.

DESCENDANTS OF THE POET KEATS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
In a paragraph in your last issue, on a gathering of 
the descendants of great poets in London this week, the 
statement is made that " the name of Keats seems to 
have vanished as though it had, in very truth, been 
• writ in water.' " While it is true that there are no 
living descendants of the poet Keats, yet several of his 
distant relatives, grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
of his brother George, are living in New York, in Rich- 
mond, and perhaps elsewhere. George Keats, it may 
be recalled, came to America in 1818, settling at Louis- 
ville, Kentuc-y, where he made his permanent home. 
Among his descendants is Mrs. Emma Keats (Speed) 
Sampson, of Richmond, Va., a gifted woman, whose 
paternal grandmother was George Keats's daughter. I 
believe, however, there is no relative of the poet with 
the surname of Keats. Fanny Keats, the poet's sister, 
lived in Spain, where her grandchildren may still be

Between the supposed commercial interests 
of the American people and their more unself- 
ish ideas and feelings there is a startling dif- 
ference. While the men interested in selling 
their steel, pork, and other things called for in 
war contracts at Government prices, are busily 
engaged in planning war with Japan, there is 
on the other side of the water a disposition to 
turn the other cheek, as far as it is possible to 
do so without dishonor. Nevertheless, it is 
generally supposed that the Christians live on 
this side of the Pacific ! If Americans could 
pay a little less attention to getting up hysteri- 
cal fears of a military invasion of our western 
shores, and give more study to the real purpose 
of the modern Japanese, there would be less 
talk about building steel castles that cost more 
than university foundations. Then the " valor 
of ignorance" would take on a new significance. 

Those who have known Japan best and 
longest realize that her one purpose and her 
chief problem is peaceful development. Hers 
is the desire, first, to provide food for her in- , 
creasing millions : and then to compel China to 
reform and become modern, and thus to arouse 
all Asia to progress. Count Okuma, in this 
great book, of which he is the master spirit, 
expresses this idea clearly. " We desire by the 
cooperation of our Anglo-Saxon friends to en- 
gage in the glorious humanitarian work of civi- 
lizing and developing two Oriental nations 
[China and Korea] now deeply sunk in misery, 
so that they too may some day be able to write 
semi-centennial stories of progress as we are now 
doing " (Vol. I., p. 53). 

This is the consuming purpose of the Japan- 
ese — to develop their own lands, from Formosa 
to Saghalien and Korea, over which they have 
assumed a protectorate with far more justifica- 
tion than we had in beginning the Spanish War 
and accepting its results. To do this, Japan has 
need of every able-bodied man. From vital 
necessity*, she is as much interested in China as 
in the United States, if not more so. Her mighty 
peril is to have a mediaeval power of such mag- 
nitude as her neighbor and frontager ; while to 
have both Korea and China developed according 
to modern ideals will be to her permanent peace 
and advantage. 

The present reviewer, who knew Count

Okuma in Japan forty years ago, as also the 
young men who were connected with him in 
forming the new government, knows that this 
ambition of the Japanese is no new thing, and 
that any feeling of innate hostility to Americans 
is purely imaginary — about as unthinkable as 
the ingratitude of Japanese children to their 
parents. The spirit of gratitude and acknowl- 
edgment of obligation to Americans breathes 
throughout this book. Count Okuma was 
himself a pupil of the American missionary 
Verbeck, who was the great trainer of Japanese 
statesmen ; while many of the younger men in 
public life were taught by those of us Americans 
who were pioneers of the secular education, 
which in Japan was founded on American prin- 
ciples and methods. 

Like the resourceful housekeeper, Count 
Okuma brings forth from the national storehouse 
things old and new. He brings into cooperation 
men who a generation ago were young like him- 
self and strenuous in bringing in the new world 
of ideas. As a matter of fact, nearly all the 
men who created the new government of 1868 
were under thirty-five, and numbered scarcely 
more than fifty. Out of this original company he 
has secured as contributors for his monumental 
history his comrades Count Soyeshima, Prince 
Ito, Prince Yamagata, Admiral Yamamoto, and 
others of "the old guard." He has even — he 
himself being the interviewer — secured a chap- 
ter of testimony from the last Shogun, who in 
1867 nobly abdicated from power, ending the 
duarchy of nearly seven hundred years, and 
refusing to lift up his hand against the Mikado. 
He is still living in Tokyo. We count his opin- 
ions among the most valuable in the book, and 
we are inclined to accept the justice of his views. 
These show that there was no real revolution, 
but a restoration of the Imperial power, a return 
to ancient unity, for which the teachings and 
example of his house (Mito) and of his ancestors 
had prepared the way. 

Space does not permit a detailed sketch of this 
intellectually new Empire. Almost everything 
that portrays external Japan is here set forth. 
The style is as clear as the matter is interesting. 
The original papers, by nearly threescore writers, 
were written in Japanese, and translated in mas- 
terly style by Captain Frank Brinkley, editor 
of "The Japan Mail." This is a feat worthy 
of admiration. Mr. Brinkley is a veritable 
Columbus in discovering idioms and equivalents.

Finance, Municipal Progress, Commercial and 
Industrial Progress. These and kindred sub- 
jects occupy chiefly the first volume. 

In the second volume the writers deal with the 
things unseen, which the commercial and aver- 
age foreigner, including the "globe-trotter" and 
the person who has " been there," in home and 
club and with the automobile, knows so little 
about. There is probably no country on earth 
concerning which the opinions of the mere trav- 
eller and resident visitor, or even quondam alien 
missionary, may or do count so little as Japan. 
No other people provoke such contradictory 
expressions of praise or blame. The reason is 
very simple. " Shallows murmur, but the deeps 
are dumb." Japan does not, cannot, reveal her- 
self all at once. There is no nation in Asia so 
young, or whose history, even the oldest part of 
it, is so modern, as Japan ; while all the time 
foreigners go there and talk about it as though 
it had a " hoary " civilization like that of China. 
Yet while the Japanese cannot satisfy modern 
criticism as to their existence as a nation much 
before the twelfth century of our era, yet in one 
sense Japan is an epitome of all Asia. The 
Japanese are not a race. They are a mixture 
of races, Arian, Semitic, Malay, and Tartar. 
No people in eastern Asia have so large an infu- 
sion of Aryan blood in their veins. The com- 
monest words in our language and in theirs are 
the same as to roots, while almost every word 
pertaining to things known to civilization are 
later than their era of initial writing, and of that 
great influx of letters and art and architecture 
which came in the train of Confucian ethics and 
the Buddhist religion in the sixth century. The 
opinions of people who know next to nothing 
about the Japanese language, art, literature, or 
history, are very nearly worthless. To know 
a people we must know what forces move and 
have moved them. There are cosmic and ocean 
currents that move the invisible nine-tenths of 
the Japanese iceberg far more than do the winds 
and surface currents the visible one- tenth. 

This second volume is exceedingly rich in 
subjects pertaining to religions, culture, and 
education, the philosophies and sciences, phi- 
lanthropy and the fine arts, journalism and 
literature, social intercourse and socialism ; and 
it will richly repay both reading and study. 

Of course Count Okuma is an optimist. 
There is no country and no people like those of 
Japan. The gifts of nature have been lavished 
there. With what Count Okuma declares in 
his buoyant and youthful optimism, one can 
find no more fault than with Sir Walter Scott, 



who depicted a kind of Middle Ages that had 
no existence, unless one shuts one's eyes to the 
dark and dreadful side of them. The Count 
dodges scientific chronology and the cold criti- 
cism of the alien in regard to the prehistoric 
days when there were many Mikados, for he 
is loyal to the core, and neither Mikadoism nor 
the primitive documents can be handled rudely 
in Japan, where academic freedom is not 
yet very well known. Ancestral worship did 
not exist in ancient Japan. He says nothing 
about the awful famines, the millions of outcasts 
and the brutalities of feudalism. He drags no 
skeletons from their closets. He writes more 
out of his feelings than out of critically sifted 
facts or rigid perspective, when he sets forth 
the history of Japan. As a subjective, personal 
presentation of Japan's development, his three 
chapters are invaluable ; but the cold-hearted 
alien wants more critical salt on his salad. Nor 
can we understand how any book giving a true 
history of the last fifty years can be written with- 
out a special chapter and pretty full accounts 
of the work done by the thousands of expert 
Europeans and Americans, including a regiment 
or two of teachers who from 1857 took hold of 
the boys who are now or have been the recon- 
structors of Japanese society and government. 
Some one must write the history of the yatoi 
(hired foreigners) who taught the Japanese the 
way out of mediae valism into modern life. 

After reading the book through and finding 
what to us are omissions, but few inaccuracies, 
we commend the work most heartily to all who 
would seek to understand the real spirit of 
Japan. It confirms, if confirmation were needed, 
the fact that the supreme purpose of Japan 
is, and has ever been, next to her own self- 
preservation, the uplift and regeneration of 
Asia. Japan is a true pupil of the Anglo-Saxon 
nations. William Elliot Griffis. 



!New Studies of the Drama.* 



Those who have read the articles on the 
drama which Professor Matthews has contrib- 
uted to the magazines within recent months, 
have looked forward' with interest to his prom- 
ised volume. The book has at last been pub- 
lished. It is written in that pleasing style which 
is both informal and informing. While the 
nature of the subject-matter precludes any 
startling novelty of ideas, there is a freshness

of method and of approach. The illustrations 
are drawn from the playwrights of all time — 
from iEschylus to Ibsen, from Sophocles to 
Maeterlinck. 

As we learn in the prefatory note, the work 
is " a study of the technic of the drama. It is 
intended, not for those who want to write plays, 
but for those who wish to learn how plays are 
written now, and how they have been written 
in the past. It is the result of a belief that the 
fundamental principles of the drama are the 
same throughout the ages. ... It is devoted 
mainly to an examination of the structural 
framework,'' and "discusses only incidentally 
the psychology, the philosophy, and the poetry " 
which we admire in the great pieces that have 
reached us. 

The author asserts in his initial chapter, 
" The Study of the Drama," that the art he 
discusses " does not lie wholly within the limit 
of literature." The playwright may call to his 
aid the arts of the actor, the musician, the 
painter, and the sculptor ; and the " literary 
merit of a play does not reside so much in its 
mere wording as in its solid structure, in the 
logic of the plot, in the sincerity of its character- 
drawing." The reader of a play " should 
endeavor always to transport himself from the 
library into the theatre and to visualize an 
actual performance." Fine writing, as such, is 
of little importance ; the thing to be emphasized 
is form and structure as adapted to presenta- 
tion. This point of view Professor Matthews 
maintains throughout. It is at the root of his 
treatment of the themes of the succeeding chap- 
ters. Let us see, briefly, what these chapters 
contain. 

The second, third, and fourth are given to 
a study of the influence exerted upon the play- 
wright by the actor, the theatre, and the audi- 
ence. The medium of the playwright is such 
that he " can never claim the right of solitary 
self-expression, which the lyrist may assert "; 
he must appeal to the public as a whole, "not 
to any coterie of dilettants." He must heed the 
performer's demand for action and character ; 
and this demand is wholesome in so far as it 
tends " to stiffen the dramatic action, to inten- 
sify the passionate climax," and " to persuade 
the poet to a larger and deeper reproduction of 
human nature." He must bow to the exactions 
of the contemporary theatre ; and, if he be a 
modern, realize that the scenery of our stage 
forbids the quick shiftings of place and the 
poetic descriptions of Elizabethan days. He 
must also reckon with the audience, with its 



prejudices, its mental and social customs; for 
the drama is the most democratic of the arts, 
and cannot exist without the multitude. The 
journeyman playright may pander to these in- 
fluences, or be hampered by the limitations 
they impose ; but the masters have found them 
a source of strength — have hearkened to the 
wants of the actor, accepted the current stage 
practices, and made themselves the most popular 
playwrights of their time. 

" The Law of the Drama " and " A Chapter 
of Definitions " are the next two titles in the 
volume. Under the former, the author approves 
the definition of the drama as "a story in 
dialogue shown in action before an audience." 
Action, however, may not consist of " mere move- 
ment or external agitation." Brunetiere has 
made it plain that " the drama must reveal the 
human will in action ; and that the central figure 
in a play must know what he wants and must 
strive for it with incessant determination." It 
follows as a corollary that certain scenes are 
essential, and must be, not inferred or related, 
but represented on the stage ; " they are the 
scenes in which we can see the struggle of con- 
tending wills." In " A Chapter of Definitions " 
we confront the bewildering terminology of 
the stage. The terms " chronicle-play " and 
" tragedy-of -blood " suggest special types of the 
drama ; farce and melodrama, as opposed to 
high-comedy and the serious drama, permit the 
plot to dominate the characters ; but the usage 
of the important words " comedy" and " tragedy" 
is far from fixed. From the French vocabulary 
of critical terms we may transplant three phrases 
to denote certain effects of comic dialogue : the 
mot (Tesprit is a witticism existing for its own 
sake ; the mot de situation takes its color from 
the incident that calls it forth ; the mot de 
caractere springs from the individuality of the 
speaker. 

" Traditions and Conventions " are next 
treated. " A tradition is an accepted way of 
doing things, which may or may not be com- 
pletely i natural.' " "A convention is a depart- 
ure from the fact," an implied contract wherein 
neither playwright nor spectator " has a right 
to violate the conditions of the treaty." All 
conventions are also traditions ; but the converse 
does not hold. Necessary conventions " are the 
result of three conditions of theatrical perform- 
ance," — limited time, which compels a compact 
and luminous dialogue ; observation by the spec- 
tator, which takes it for granted that the fourth 
wall of the room is removed ; and an overhearing 
of everything said. The soliloquy, a convention

with an interesting history, is obsolescent as a 
means of conveying information about facts, but 
as a revelation of the hero's conflicting emotions 
at a crisis its use is higher and more defensible. 

Under the head of "Dramatic Characteri- 
zation " the author tells us that although " a 
sufficient story is a prerequisite to immediate 
success, it will [in itself] bestow only a fleeting 
popularity." " We reserve our warmest regard 
for the men and the women who carry it on. It 
is by veracity of character delineation, by sub- 
tlety of psychology, that the great plays are 
great." And " in the final analysis, it is by his 
power of projecting characters that the dram- 
atist survives." Whether, in evolving his play, 
he begins with plot or with character matters 
little, so he gives the appearance of a plot sub- 
ordinate to character. He must exclude those 
details in the history of his characters that 
have no bearing on the story, yet through his 
creative imagination endow them with a life so 
large and a personality so rich that variety and 
complexity will be their possession. 

The next themes are " The Logic of Con- 
struction " and "The Analysis of a Play." A 
stringent constructive faculty is necessary to the 
playwright. In the strict limitation of his time, 
and in the need to make things clear as he goes, 
exciting curiosity perhaps, but never misleading, 
he is hedged by difficulties unknown to the 
writer of prose fiction. " He cannot rely on 
constructed decoration ; he can only decorate his 
construction." In his exposition — that is, his 
conveying of the knowledge essential to a fol- 
lowing of the plot — he must avoid on one hand 
those devices which are trite and outworn, and 
on the other that obscurity which is fatal. His 
plot must have beginning, middle, and end, 
showing a segment from life which is complete 
within itself. He must exclude chance and 
caprice altogether, or reduce them to a minimum 
and confine them to that part of the story which 
he does not present on the stage. The more 
nearly every action seems the inevitable result 
of the characters and the conditions, the finer 
and more enduring will his achievement be. 
But if his method of construction is not sternly 
logical, — if he does not present an essential 
struggle, consistent characters, happily-chosen 
scenes, large truth to life, etc., — the spectator 
will know, though blindly perhaps, what an 
analysis will disclose as unavoidable, that the 
interest is not focused and therefore not main- 
tained. 

In the chapter on " The Elizabethan Dra- 



matists " the author states that the literary 
form which happens to be popular in any given 
period is certain to attract men whose native 
gift lies elsewhere. So it was in the days of 
Elizabeth, for the talents of many of the play- 
wrights were not primarily dramaturgic. The 
audience could be pleased without firmly- 
textured plots, and the playwrights did not 
trouble themselves about the readers of the 
future. Their work was better in parts than as 
a whole : Lamb's Selections show them at their 
best, and indiscriminate eulogies have given us 
too exalted an opinion of them. Their poetic 
merits are superb, but, excepting Shakespeare, 
" they are great as playwrights only occasion- 
ally, and almost, as it were, by accident." 
Linked with this chapter is its supplement, 
" The Poetic Drama and the Dramatic Poem." 
Here the author affirms that the closet-drama 
does not justify itself, because it is too easy ; 
its writer lacks the stimulation of a grapple 
with difficulties. Moreover, those plays which 
have been intended for acting, but have included 
also a deliberately poetic strain, have failed in 
the theatre " because their authors did not keep 
an eye single on the stage. They may have 
had the impatient spectator in mind, but they 
had also the leisurely reader ; and as a result 
they fell between two stools." " Whenever and 
wherever the poetic drama has existed, it has 
been primarily dramatic and only secondarily 
poetic." 

The final chapter — for, unluckily for the 
reader, there are only thirteen — discusses " The 
Three Unities." It reminds us that the ever- 
valid unity of action is the only one to which 
Aristotle gave formal statement, and traces the 
hampering application of the unities of time 
and of place to the critics of the Italian Renas- 
cence. Yet " there is, after all, something to 
be urged in behalf of the three unities." Of 
this there is evidence in two works of practical 
nineteenth-century playwrights — in the " Fran- 
cillon " of the younger Dumas and the " Ghosts " 
of Ibsen. 

This review attempts to give hints, rather 
than a summary, of what the volume contains. 
The brief and rather dogmatic statements fail 
to do justice to Professor Matthews, who puts 
his points fairly, without contention. The book 
as a whole is delightful and illuminating. An 
appendix contains pertinent " Suggestions for 
Study," together with some concise and helpful 
" Bibliographical Suggestions."

Biographical, Studies of 
Wild Animals.* 



Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton entered the world 
of letters in 1883 with an article on the Striped 
Gopher. Three years later he read a paper 
before the Historical and Scientific Society of 
Manitoba, on the Mammals of Manitoba. This 
modest little article formed the nucleus of the 
present magnificent work, " Life Histories of 
Northern Animals." The bare statement hardly 
suggests the extraordinary possibilities of such 
an expansion. Roughly speaking, the same 
species are treated in both — forty-nine in the 
pamphlet of 1886, and sixty in the latter work. 
The former, however, covered but fifteen pages, 
while the latter fills two huge volumes of 1267 
pages. The pamphlet was reprinted in 1887, 
in a slightly enlarged form, treating fifty-two 
species. This reprint contained six illustrations 
by the author. The new work is illustrated with 
68 maps and 560 drawings, many of them full- 
page. Mr. Seton divides his work into two 
parts, or volumes, the first devoted to Grass- 
eaters and the second to Flesh-eaters. The 
former includes the Deer family, the Wapiti or 
Canadian Elk, the Northern Whitetailed Deer, 
the Blacktailed Mule-deer, the Moose, and the 
Woodland Caribou ; the Prong-horned Ante- 
lope ; the American Bison or Buffalo ; the 
Squirrel family ; the Canadian Beaver ; eleven 
members of the wide-spread Mouse family ; the 
Gray-gopher ; the Jumping-mouse ; the Porcu- 
pine : and the Hare family. The second volume 
embraces the Canada Lynx ; the Kit-fox and 
Royal Fox, the Gray Wolf and Coyote ; the 
Otter, Weasel, Mink, Spruce Marten, Fisher, 
Wolverine, Skunk, and Badger ; the Raccoon ; 
the Grizzly-bear and Black-bear; the Shrew 
family ; the Star-nosed Mole ; and the Web- 
tailed Bats. 

Although the work is limited to the sixty 
species frund in Manitoba, in tracing their life- 
histories Mr. Seton follows them into all parts 
of their ranges ; and in this way the book is to 
a large extent an account of the mammals of 
North America. The author says : 

" Thirty years of personal observations are herein set 
forth ; every known fact bearing on the habits of these 
animals has, as far as possible, been presented, and 
everything in my power has been done to make this a 
serious, painstaking, loving attempt to penetrate the 
intimate side of the animals' lives — the side that has 
so long been overlooked, because until lately we have 
persistently regarded wild things as mere living targets,

and have seen in them nothing but savage or timorous 
creatures, killing or escaping being killed, quite for- 
getting that they have their homes, their mates, their 
problems, and their sorrows, — in short, a home-life that 
is their real life, and very often much larger and more 
important than that of which our hostile standpoint has 
given us such fleeting glimpses." 

In addition to his own personal observations, 
covering nearly every State in the Union, and 
most of the Canadian Provinces, Mr. Seton has 
gathered together from widely-scattered sources 
the evidence of hundreds of other students of the 
animal life of the continent, the result forming 
a most remarkable series of animal biographies. 
For some years past Mr. Seton has been widely 
known as a writer of entertaining stories of 
animal life. Some readers, judging the form 
rather than the substance, and with very limited 
knowledge of the facts of wild animal life, have 
assumed a rather patronizing attitude toward 
these tales, and jumped to the conclusion that 
they were founded on nothing more substantial 
than the vivid imagination of a clever maker 
of fiction. Not the least important feature of 
the present work is the testimony it affords, 
in clear and scientific terms, as to the substantial 
accuracy of these animal stories. Here, as in so 
many other cases, the fact is shown to be often 
more wonderful than fiction. 

Another important result of Mr. Seton's work 
is the correction of many popular misconceptions. 
One of these concerns the speed of wild animals. 
We have all heard marvellous stories as to the 
phenomenal speed of the coyote, the antelope, 
and several other animals. After gathering all 
the available data on the subject, Mr. Seton has 
reached the deliberate conclusion that the horse 
still holds his own. " There seems no good rea- 
son," says he, " for supposing that any creature 
on legs — two, three, or four — ever went for any 
distance faster than a blood race-horse. Salva- 
tor's mile in 1 minute 35^ seconds is the fast- 
est pace reliably recorded for anything afoot." 
Tabulating the evidence, Mr. Seton puts the fast- 
est four-footed animals in the following order : 
Race-horse, best speed for a mile at the rate of 34 
miles an hour ; Prong-horned antelope, 32 miles 
an hour; Greyhound, 30 miles; Texan Jack- 
rabbit, 28 ; Common Fox, 26 ; Northern Coyote, 
24 ; Foxhound, 22 ; and American Gray-wolf, 20. 
It is interesting to note that a man's best speed 
for a mile is at the rate of 14 miles an hour. 

A number of ancient errors concerning the 
Beaver are also exposed. It cannot and does 
not drive stakes ; it never plasters the lodge with 
mud outside — all beaver-lodges are finished out- 
side with sticks; it does not use its tail as a 



272 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



trowel ; it does not suck the air out of sticks to 
make them stay down ; it does not cut or carry 
large logs or use them in the dam ; when caught 
in a steel trap it does not deliberately amputate 
the foot, but twists about and pulls until it is 
torn off. On the other hand, Mr. Seton, in his 
very readable chapter on the Beaver, does 
much to rehabilitate the character of this 
sagacious animal. Time was when the Beaver 
was popularly endowed with almost superhuman 
intelligence. Of late years we have been inclined 
to rush to the opposite extreme, and deny it even 
moderate sagacity. The truth lies between. The 
facts here presented, and amply substantiated 
from the works of such careful observers as 
Lewis H. Morgan, Audubon, Bachman, and 
other naturalists, including the author, place the 
Beaver in the first rank among four-footed arti- 
sans. It is gratifying, therefore, to know that 
successful efforts are now being made to restore 
the Beaver to some of his old haunts, in 
Pennsylvania, New York, Ontario, and Quebec. 
"There can be no doubt," says Mr. Seton, 
"that the Beaver did more to open up Canada 
than any other creature or product. It was the 
pursuit of the Beaver that lured on the early 
explorers and that brought here the original 
colonists. It was Beaver fur that bought for 
white men the manufactures of Europe that were 
needed to make life tolerable when first our 
people took to the woods ; and it is fitting indeed 
that this creature, the symbol of energy, peace, 
and industry, should be the emblem of the 
country for which it did so much." 

One is tempted to quote some of the many 
interesting bits of animal biographies found 
everywhere between the covers of these two 
substantial volumes, but limits of space make 
this impossible. It is sufficient to assure the 
reader that he will find here an immense amount 
of trustworthy information on each of the ani- 
mals whose life-histories are given ; and the 
whole is presented in such fascinating form, 
and so attractively illustrated, that he will find 
it impossible to skip a single page. 

Where every point has been covered with so 
much care and thoroughness, it seems almost 
an impertinence to suggest additional informa- 
tiou. One or two facts may, however, be worth 
mentioning. On page 271 it is stated that the 
horse arrived on the great plains of the North- 
west — the Buffalo range — about the close of 
the eighteenth century. In the Journal of 
Anthony Hendry, 1754-55 (Transactions of 
the Royal Society of Canada, 1908) the Black- 
feet are described as being accomplished horse- 



men in the middle of the eighteenth century ; 
and there is reason to believe that the arrival 
of this powerful factor in the extirpation of the 
Buffalo must be carried back to the beginning 
of the eighteenth century. The same journal 
may be cited among early records of the Buffalo 
in what is now the Canadian Northwest ; as may 
also Cooking's Journal, 1772-73 (Transactions 
of Royal Society, 1909). Early mention of 
the Antelope will be found in Cooking's Jour- 
nal, and in the narrative of Larocque (Canadian

The Story of New England Expansion.* 



The muse of history, it is well known, has of 
late been turning her attention in various new 
directions. Kings and parliaments have not 
ceased to have their interest ; the lives of presi- 
dents and generals are still fascinating ; but we 
are more and more becoming interested in the 
lives of common men, the unknown toilers 
whose names are only in rare instances handed 
down, yet whose influence lives in the institu- 
tions they helped to frame and perpetuate. 
The humble and illiterate have always been 
purveyors of comedy ; we now concede that in 
their obscure lives there may also be supreme 
tragedies. 

One is reminded of these things in reading 
Miss Mathews's volume, which has to do with 
the peopling of New England and the northern 
Middle and Middle- Western States by the sturdy, 
radical, God-fearing Puritans and their descend- 
ants. One is reminded, also, of the many- 
sidedness of history ; since this book suggests 
not only the comic and tragic possibilities of 
pioneer life, but also its romance. The pioneer 
epoch has already become for us a remote 
world, in which both Arthur Dimmesdale and 
Natty Bumppo have their being. In these days 
of lightning communication with all parts of 
the country, we have quickly forgotten the time 
when a journey from western Massachusetts to

central New York was a matter of weeks of 
difficult and dangerous travel. 

Miss Mathews has, however, held resolutely 
to the less picturesque and romantic yet cer- 
tainly more important aspects of her subject, 
and has produced a substantial contribution to 
the early history of the northern United States. 
The subject is fresh, and the treatment of it is 
fitting and adequate. In the preparation of her 
work the author has had to evaluate and digest 
a mass of town, county, and state histories. It 
may be remarked, in passing, that the value of 
such works of local history becomes evident 
when one begins to labor on a subject like this. 
The author's sense of proportion is commend- 
able. Instead of piling up details which would 
only have swollen the volume without furnish- 
ing more light on the topics involved, she has 
frequently selected typical groups of facts, and 
thus constantly gives general impressions — a 
thing which is of the utmost importance. 

What were the causes of emigration to the 
New World ? Miss Mathews has well summed 
them up : lack of religious liberty (a condition 
due to excessive radicalism), church quarrels, 
the desire to retrieve fallen fortunes or make 
more money by trade or agriculture, the Wan- 
derlust always characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon 
temperament. And the same causes which 
brought the English to the shores of America 
have spurred on the more radical and adven- 
turous spirits to extend the frontier and experi- 
ment there with their ideas of education and 
government of church and state. 

" The tendency of those portions of the country first 
peopled has been to grow conservative, and even to 
crystallize, as England had seemed to have done when 
the first emigrants left her shores. As the towns on 
the coast grew slower to change character and institu- 
tions, the more radical spirits began to chafe, and turn 
to newer sections where they might be unhampered by 
either tradition or habit. They have not, however, 
been wholly divested of either, and have turned as their 
fathers had done to the civilization of their birth-place 
for precedents, compromising, conceding, and readjust- 
ing because of new conditions and new elements, and 
thus shaping institutions which were neither wholly 
new nor entirely old. Again and again, with each 
succeeding generation, has the process been repeated, 
with England as the background, the older colonies as 
the ' middle distance,' and the newest of our states as 
the foreground." 

The story of the settlement of New England 
is of great interest. Up to 1629 only a few 
villages were planted along the coast from 
Plymouth in Massachusetts to St. George in 
Maine. Then came the beginning of the En- 
glish emigration due to the discontent aroused 
by the harsh and blind policy of Charles I. 



John Endicott with 380 emigrants came in 1629 
to Lynn and Salem. The next year a thousand 
more came, to found Boston and other towns ; 
and by 1637 the eastern coast of Massachusetts 
had been settled as far south as Plymouth, and 
beginnings had been made at Springfield, and in 
Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Con- 
necticut. By 1660 the coast from St. George 
to Greenwich (Connecticut) had been practically 
all settled, and the settlements on the Connec- 
ticut River had largely grown. Two features 
characterize the earliest settlements : (a) the 
community always centred about the church ; 
(b) education was generously supported. For 
example, " The Massachusetts Bay General 
Court passed an act in 1649 compelling every 
town of fifty householders to appoint a teacher 
for all their children ; and further requiring a 
grammar school for every town of one hundred 
families or more. Connecticut and New Haven 
adopted the same system, as did Plymouth at a 
later time." 

The period from the Restoration to the peace 
of Utrecht was one of rapid development of the 
colonies, though a terrible setback came in King 
Philip's War. In 1675 there were perhaps 
120,000 people in New England, of whom 
16,000 could bear arms. The uprising under 
Philip, however, wiped out scores of villages, 
and the frontier receded to such an extent that 
by 1713 it had little more than made up the 
ground lost in 1675-7. Miss Mathews thinks 
she detects, by 1713, that difference between 
the frontiersmen and the inhabitants of the older 
towns on the coast to which we have alluded. 
Concerning tendencies on the frontier, where 
the more radical pioneers still struggled crudely 
though vigorously with the forces of nature, the 
author remarks : 

" It was on the frontier that men from the various 
colonies mingled, and while they held in common the 
stern religious views and educational ideas of their 
ancestors, these were tempered by contact with others 
of somewhat different cast; so that while fundamentally 
the ideals of all were the same, — all were striving 
toward civil and religious liberty, and all were tenacious 
of their rights, — individualism still found its freest 
development out at the edge of civilization." 

With the Peace of Utrecht the frontier began 
to be pushed northward and westward much more 
rapidly. The next forty years saw the Maine 
settlements carried north to Waterville, the New 
Hampshire settlements extended to Bristol (and 
on the Connecticut to Charlestown), and begin- 
nings made in southeastern Vermont, south- 
eastern New York, and northern and southern 
New Jersey. It was in this period that specu-

lation in lands became common, as it did in 
England about 1720. Owing to the repressive 
measures passed by England on colonial manu- 
facturing schemes, the capital which had now 
accumulated in the colonies could find no other 
form of investment than in land. As the grants 
of land had to be settled within three or seven 
years, much pressure was brought to bear on 
families to move to new settlements. Influences 
tending to check emigration were fear of the 
Indians, and the difficulty of getting titles to 
new lands, largely because of the ignorance of 
geography, which resulted in overlapping grants 
or in setting too indefinite boundaries. This was 
one of the chief factors making against the set- 
tlement of Maine. 

The three decades ending with the Revolu- 
tionary War were marked by rapid colonial ex- 
pansion. The defective colonial charters were 
revised, titles were made secure, and as soon as 
peace was in sight the more restless and radical 
population surged to the north and the far West. 
Thirty-one new towns were begun in Vermont 
in 1776-81, many New Yorkers settling there. 
Eleven towns in Maine date from 1780-1, and 
the Maine frontier had then advanced north as 
far as Orono, Machias, and Calais. The num- 
ber of Connecticut students at Dartmouth is 
interesting ; 42.6 per cent of the graduates in 
1770-90 were from Connecticut. Beginnings 
were also made in northeastern Pennsylvania. 

The second half of this interesting book gives 
chiefly the story of the migrations from New 
England to New York and the Middle West, 
from 1781 to 1865. The great movement into 
Central New York began in 1783 and reached 
its climax by 1820, when the entire state except 
the Adirondack region had been settled. The 
census of 1850 showed 6.6 per cent of the 
inhabitants of New York to have been born in 
New England. By 1840 Ohio's frontier had 
disappeared, the northern part and some dis- 
tricts in the centre and southeast having been 
occupied by New England settlers. In 1850, 
65,632 Ohioans, or 3.3 per cent of the popula- 
tion, had been born in New England. The 
numbers and percentages of native New Eng- 
enders in the neighboring states in that year 
were as follows: Indiana, 10,646, or 1.08 per 
cent; Illinois, 36,532, or 4.29 per cent; Michi- 
gan, 30,923, or 7.78 per cent; Wisconsin, 
27,029, or 8.8 per cent. Concerning the settle- 
ment of Indiana, Miss Mathews remarks : 

" Indiana was never a favorite stopping-place for the 
New Englanders, for the Southern element was strong 
here, and the Virginian or Kentuckian was apt to con- 



fuse the shrewd, unscrupulous ' Yankee ' peddler of 
cheap clocks with the substantial Connecticut farmer, 
and to treat the two alike." 

Among the reasons for emigration to the 
Western frontier, Miss Mathews finds the most 
potent in general to have been the search for 
cheap and fertile land Connected with this as 
a powerful motive has been discontent with 
existing social or religious conditions, and the 
reluctance to yield to the will of a hostile ma- 
jority. With the emigrants went the institutions 
they had fostered in New England — school 
and church and town-meeting ; yet these under- 
went certain changes. 

" The church must become more liberal, it must take 
on the Presbyterian form if that would insure its 
growth; it must be divorced from politics, since one 
reason for the removal to the frontier had often been 
the union of church and state upon the coast. Far from 
escaping from the majority rule, the pioneer had become 
subject to it anew; but it was now his majority, and he 
could afford to yield to gain his ends. The school had 
to change also. Separation of the sexes had been the 
rule in New England; coeducation became the habit of 
the West. Partly due to lack of funds, partly perhaps 
owing to the intense feeling of equality not only between 
man and man, but between man and woman, the coedu- 
cational plan became the custom for the Western 
states. It was not always adopted willingly, for con- 
servatism and tradition in such matters die hard; but in 
the end a shrewd business sense dictated the policy, and 
it won." 

The reaction of the frontier upon the older 
parts of the country is an interesting phase of 
the subject, which the author might have treated 
at much greater length. We have already 
noted the divergence of views which was bound 
to arise between East and West. In some parts 
of the country it was on the question of paper 
money ; in others, on the connection of church 
and state; at length it turned on the question 
of slavery in the new states — the most tremen- 
dous question, in all its ramifications, that has 
ever agitated the country. The election to the 
Presidency, in 1860, of Lincoln, a frontiersman, 
in the contest with Douglas, a native of conser- 
vative Vermont, was the answer of the frontier to 
the question as to which element in the country 
should have control.* 

Miss Mathews's volume f must be pronounced 
an able and useful study of an important sub-

The IjrFE-STORY or a Great Musician.* 



Musical biography is often sadly lacking in 
interest for the general reader, so intent are its 
writers upon questions of technique. A happy 
exception to this rule is found in a recent book 
on Handel, by Mr. R. H. Streatfeild, published 
in the New Library of Music. The author 
says in his preface : "I have tried to find the 
man Handel in his music ; to trace his charac- 
ter, his view of life, his thoughts, feelings, and 
aspirations, as set forth in his work." This 
point of view is consistently held throughout the 
book ; and though the critical study of Handel's 
work is thorough and painstaking enough to 
command the admiration of a student, we never 
lose sight of the man. He is vividly portrayed 
in all his vigorous uprightness, his genuine 
modesty and independence, at a time when ser- 
vility was the rule. In summing up the story 
of Handel's struggles in London, the author 
says : " He was an incarnation of the spirit of 
revolt against the old system of patronage that 
had ruled the world of music so long. Here 
was a man who, while every other musician in 
the land remained at an angle of forty-five 
degrees in the presence of his princely patron, 
resolutely stood upright, went his own way, and 
snapped his fingers in their ducal faces." Mr. 
Streatfeild also heartily disagrees with those 
amiable early biographers who have tried to 
show that Handel was what is called " a pious 
man," adding that " his religion was eminently 
of the type which, as Disraeli observed, all 
sensible men profess but no sensible man talks 
about." 

Nearly half of the book treats of the external 
events in the musician's life, his boyhood in 
Halle, his years of work and growing reputa- 
tion in Italy, his struggles, defeats, and final 
success in London. The stories of his early 
precocity are critically examined to determine 
what elements of truth they contain ; the dis- 
cussion of the four years spent in Naples, Rome,

The 



and Venice gives an excellent idea of his noble 
patrons and is full of the atmosphere of the 
times ; and the struggles of his London years 
are described with a fairness and sympathy most 
refreshing. The breadth of view, so noticeable 
a feature of this book, is nowhere better shown 
than in the following interesting passage, de- 
scribing Handel's triumph. 

" The battle was won at last. The struggle had been 
long and severe, but Handel had come out a conqueror 
in the end. With everything against him, he had won 
by sheer force of personality. What Pitt was doing in 
the world of politics, Handel had done in the world of 
art. Different as were the spheres in which they worked, 
the 'Great Commoner' and the composer of »The 
Messiah ' had much in common. Both were poets in 
an age of prose, transcendentalists waging mortal con- 
flict with the forces of materialism. In the Parliament 
of that day, Pitt stood alone; the depth of his convic- 
tion, his fiery energy, his poetic imagination, his appeal 
to the higher instincts of mankind contrasting strangely 
with the mercenary opportunism of the world in which 
he moved. England rallied round the man whose hands 
were clean in an age of corruption, whose life was pure 
in the midst of debauchery, and who loved his country 
with a passionate reverence. Handel's appeal was based 
on similar grounds. The turning-point of his career 
was when in 1747 he threw aside his subscription and 
appealed to the public at large. In the middle class he 
found the audience that he had sought in vain in the 
pampered worldlings of the court. The splendid seri- 
ousness of Handel's music, its wide humanity, its exal- 
tation of thought, its unfaltering dignity of utterance, 
had fallen on deaf ears so long as he appealed only to 
an aristocratic audience. It was in the heart and brain 
of the middle class that Handel found at last an echo 
to his clarion call." 

The latter half of the book is devoted to a 
careful study of Handel's writings. With rare 
discrimination, and painstaking though never 
tedious accuracy, the writer traces the plot of 
each of the forty-three operas and thirty-four 
oratorios. He emphasizes in each instance 
that distinctive atmosphere so characteristic of 
Handel's music. He traces through various 
works his three distinct styles of composition, — 
the earliest, purely German, that he learned 
from Zachow at Halle ; his operatic manner, 
almost wholly Italian ; then the later English 
method, at first influenced by Purcell, " whom 
Handel s mighty strength of wing soon left far 
behind." Mr. Streatfeild emphasizes especially 
one characteristic of Handel's music, much 
neglected by earlier writers, — his feeling for 
Nature. The familiar Largo, for example, from 
the opera Serse, is sung by the hero, Xerxes, 
standing under the boughs of his favorite plane- 
tree. In its broad, rich harmonies and satisfy- 
ing melody he who can may feel all the sense of 
shelter, content, and rest, inspired by the shade 
of a great tree. In speaking of Handel's setting

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



for L' Allegro, the author says: "It is a series 
of exquisite genre pictures, sketched with the 
lightest touch and yet elaborated with the most 
intimate detail." Again, in the analysis of 
"Israel in Egypt," attention is called to the 
amazing picture of the " weary march of the 
Israelites through the desert. Then the serene 
loveliness of the land flowing with milk and honey 
is painted with a tranquil charm, intensified by 
the harsh discords of the preceding chorus. 
Handel appreciated the majesty and splendor of 
the sea as perhaps no other composer has done." 

One very interesting feature of the book is 
the author's frequent comparison of Handel's 
work with that of other great musicians, espe- 
cially with that of Bach. He thus effectively 
sums up in concluding the study of " The 
Messiah " : 

" Bach was unquestionably a more spiritually minded, 
or, as we now say, a more religious man, than Handel. 
When he wrote the Sanctus he was rapt away from 
earth . . . Handel's feet are always upon solid earth. 
His imagination opened all portals, but he passed none. 
When he wrote the • Hallelujah ' chorus he ' did think 
he saw heaven opened and the great God Himself,' but 
he was not, like Bach, caught up in spirit to the heaven 
that he beheld. Handel was an artist rather than a 
seer. . . . There was a good deal more of Titian than 
of Fra Angelico in Handel. For the rapture of spiritual 
ecstasy we ask of Handel in vain, but instead he gives 
us an all-embracing sympathy for every manifestation 
of human energy, that lifts his work far above sects 
and dogmas and makes it the common property of all 
mankind." 

In this way columns might be filled with 
extracts from this most readable book. A work 
of this kind cannot fail to do valuable service 
in widening and rendering more intelligent the 
appreciation of music and its authors.

Problems and Tendencies of 
American IiIfe.* 



" America," wrote Mr. Bryce a decade and a half 
ago, " changes so fast that every few years a new 
crop of books is needed to describe the new face 
which things have put on, the new problems that 
have appeared, the new ideas germinating among

her people, the new and unexpected developments 
for evil as well as for good of which her established 
institutions have been found capable." Within the 
past few months, while Mr. Bryce has himself been 
occupied with the preparation of a revised edition 
of his " American Commonwealth," there has flowed 
from the presses on both sides of the Atlantic a 
veritable stream of volumes, each of which has been 
intended, within the scope marked out by its author, 
to make some contribution to the ever alluring, 
never finished interpretation of American life and 
nationality. 

Much the most ambitious project of the sort 
recently brought to light is that which has been 
undertaken by an English journalist long resident 
in this country, Mr. A. Maurice Low. His book 
comprises nothing less than an attempt to elucidate 
the psychology of the American people. Most of 
us would be inclined at the outset, perhaps, to pro- 
nounce such a task impossible of accomplishment. 
The psychology of any mass of eighty or ninety 
millions of men and women is an extremely elusive 
thing; and, furthermore, the people of America 
represent a conglomeration of racial elements such 
as would seem scarcely to admit of anything in the 
nature of composite characterization. Mr. Low, 
however, is devoid of apprehensions. "The psy- 
chology of the American people," he avers, " pre- 
sents no miracle and is reducible to exact terms. 
We have here no unfathomable mystery. There 
are no gaps to be filled by speculative soaring." 
Recalling that for a good many years Mr. Low has 
been writing of things American with very credit- 
able candor and discernment, one is constrained to 
possess himself in patience and await results. 

A volume recently published, "The Planting of 
a Nation," is the first of a series in which Mr. Low 
proposes to trace the historical development of the 
American character, and, subsequently, to describe 
and appraise the principal traits of the present-day 
American citizen. Having set himself to write the 
biography of a people, it follows that he must begin 
with the incunabula of the race ; consequently, the 
initial volume is largely taken up with a survey of 
population origins, and of the climatic and other 
physical conditions by which the earlier generations 
of European settlers in America were surrounded. 
This is a well-tilled field, and it cannot be said that 
Mr. Low's contributions to our knowledge of it have 
been considerable. If we are to judge by his bibli- 
ography and foot-notes, there has been small resort 
to authorities other than the more obvious secondary 
writers. Still, it is but fair to observe that Mr. 
Low disclaims any intention of writing history. His 
task, as he has conceived it, is rather to assume the 
facts and to proceed to an interpretation of them 
from certain novel points of view, principally the 
psychological. On this side, portions of the book 
are distinctly illuminating, more particularly those 
which deal with the contributions made to the 
American character by the Puritan. 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



277 



The Puritan, Mr. Low regards as the real founder 
of American institutions ; and the Puritan he de- 
clares to have been an Englishman of Englishmen, 
bringing with him to our shores English institutions, 
English morals, and the English mental attitude. 
Much stress is laid upon the proposition that the 
Puritan, while austere and fanatical and much 
given to morbid introspection, was neither without 
natural human affections, nor a sense of humor, nor 
averse to rational amusements ; also that the Puritan 
colonist, far from living in squalor or poverty, was 
"in many respects better clothed and fed and 
housed than the mass of the English people living 
in England." That the men who first settled Vir- 
ginia were drawn from a higher social scale than 
the Puritans, and that morally and intellectually 
the Cavalier was the superior of the New Englander, 
is pronounced a delusion, propagated only by inexact 
historians and careless writers. Ample justice, 
however, is done the Cavalier ; and, in truth, the 
author in his later chapters comes dangerously near 
undermining the structure of Puritan supremacy 
which he has earlier set up. " The American," he 
declares, ''is a blend of the Puritan and the Cava- 
lier, to accept an inexact terminology so rich in 
contrast ; a mixture of Massachusetts and Virginia ; 
a product of the corn that ripened slowly under 
northern skies and the tobacco that sprung into life 
in the soil of the South. The influence of Massa- 
chusetts is there, but so also is that of Virginia; 
and great as is the influence of Massachusetts, that 
of Virginia is no less. It was tobacco that made 
Virginia so different from Massachusetts ; it was 
Virginia that made the American so different from 
what he would have been had another Massachusetts 
taken root in the South." There is not, in the 
present volume, a great deal that is really new or 
striking ; but with more or less familiar material a 
substantial foundation has been laid and the author's 
real opportunity lies yet ahead. If he shall be 
able to disentangle and to elucidate the psychology 
of the formation of American nationality after the 
achievement of political independence, his labors 
will have been well worth while. 

Not much less comprehensive than Mr. Low's pro- 
ject in its chronological sweep is Mr. Herbert Croly's 
volume on " The Promise of American Life." What 
Mr. Croly has sought to do is to give us an exposition 
of what he conceives to be the " promise " of Ameri- 
can life and institutions, together with some indica- 
tion as to what the prospects are respecting the 
realization of that promise. The promise consists 
substantially, we are told, in %i an improving popular 
economic condition, guaranteed by democratic polit- 
ical institutions, and resulting in moral and social 
amelioration." Consideration of so comprehensive 
a theme involves a survey of practically the whole 
of American political, economic, and social devel- 
opment. The larger portion of the book is therefore 
taken up with an historical sketch of American 
problems and American traditions from the days of 
Jeffersonian Republicanism to the presidency of 



Theodore Roosevelt, together with a series of chap- 
ters discussing at much length a wide variety of 
national questions and interests of the present day. 
The principal thesis is that at the outset, a century 
and a quarter ago, America seemed clearly to our 
forefathers to give promise of becoming, almost 
inevitably, a veritable paradise of political freedom, 
economic opportunity, and social equality ; but that, 
large as the realization has been, it is manifest that 
the promise is yet far from complete fulfilment, — 
that, indeed, the fulfilment must no longer be thought 
of as in any sense " an inexorable national destiny, 
but rather as a conscious national purpose " which 
may or may not attain its end. The problem upon 
whose solution the f ulfilment of the promise mainly 
depends is declared to be, not political, or religious, 
but social. "The American problem is the social 
problem partly because the social problem is the 
democratic problem. American political and social 
leaders will find that in a democracy the problem 
cannot be evaded. The American people have no 
irremediable political grievances. No good Ameri- 
can denies the desirability of popular sovereignty 
and of a government which should somehow repre- 
sent the popular will. While our national institu- 
tions may not be a perfect embodiment of these 
doctrines, a decisive and a resolute popular majority 
has the power to alter American institutions and 
give them a more immediately representative char- 
acter. ... In the long run, consequently, the ordi- 
nary American will have nothing irremediable to 
complain about except economic and social inequali- 
ties. In Europe such will not be the case. The 
several European peoples have, and will continue to 
have, political grievances, because such grievances 
are the inevitable consequence of their national his- 
tory and their international situation, and as long 
as these grievances remain, the more difficult social 
problem will be subordinated to an agitation for 
political emancipation. But the American people, 
having achieved democratic institutions, have noth- 
ing to do but to turn them to good account. In so 
far as the social problem is a real problem and the 
economic grievance a real grievance, they are bound 
under the American political system to come event- 
ually to the surface and to demand express and 
intelligent consideration. A democratic ideal makes 
the social problem inevitable and its attempted solu- 
tion indispensable." 

In following out his analysis of American develop- 
ment and of current American problems, Mr. Croly 
ranges over a field that is truly enormous. Politics, 
constitutional law, international relations, industrial 
conditions, labor movements, reform programmes, 
educational questions, — all these and many other 
things, are brought under survey. Comparison of 
American with European experience is frequent, — 
there being in one place, for example, a fifty-page 
digression on democracy and nationality in the prin- 
cipal European states. Indeed, one puts down the 
book with the feeling that the author has undertaken 
too much, and that its usefulness to the America

reader would have been much enhanced by a judicious 
elimination of a good deal that is commonplace and 
unessential, so that its unquestionably vital message 
might have been made to stand out in bolder relief. 

During the winter of 1908-09, Dr. Henry van 
Dyke, as Hyde lecturer at the University of Paris 
and at certain of the provincial universities, under- 
took to interpret to the French " the things that 
seem vital, significant, and creative in the life and 
character of the American people." The first seven 
of a series of twenty-six conferences given in this 
connection have been brought together for American 
publication under title, "The Spirit of America." 
Those who are familiar with the charm with which 
Dr. van Dyke invariably invests poetry and essay 
alike will not require to be assured that the present 
papers are readable. Seemingly but slight sketches, 
they are none the less crowded with evidences of 
deep insight, and with interpretative analysis which 
is very far from superficial. The " spirit of America " 
is shown to comprise something more than sheer 
energy — more than la vie intense, of which Euro- 
peans have in late years heard so much that their 
conception of Americans has perhaps suffered more 
than the customary distortion. Love of fair play, 
unfailing will-power, the sentiment of common order- 
liness, a keen appreciation of the value of individual 
development, — these are some of the factors which 
are described as entering, along with aggressive 
energy, into the make-up of our composite American 
spirit. 

In the book entitled " Americans : An Impression " 
Mr. Alexander Francis has given us an English view 
of American conditions, especially social, industrial, 
and educational. The score of chapters comprising 
the book first appeared as a series of special articles 
in the London " Times," and are to some extent 
already familiar to American readers. During his 
year's residence in the United States, Mr. Francis 
spent the larger part of his time in college and uni- 
versity centres ; and far the most valuable portions 
of his book are those in which he records his im- 
pressions (not unmingled with criticism) of academic 
methods and customs in this country. Admitting 
that the fundamental idea of elective studies is 
sound, he none the less condemns sweepingly the 
" crude and unscientific elective system " as it widely 
prevails ; and, as is to be expected from a foreign 
observer, he unhesitatingly deprecates the conditions 
attending intercollegiate athletics. 

Mr. Van Wyck Brooks denominates his work on 
" The Wine of the Puritans " a study of present-day 
America. The texture is altogether too thin to 
warrant so pretentious a sub-title ; and yet in these 
happy-go-lucky musings of two American artists in 
Italy respecting the red wine of Puritanism, and 
the new bottles in which, under twentieth century 
American conditions, it is compelled to be treasured 
up, there are occasional touches of human philosophy 
in which more ponderous writers are apt to be bar- 
ren enough. ^_ >.

The strong man at the head of the 
52%%££* M ^an . Government, now rapidly 

approaching his eightieth year, is 
unquestionably one of the greatest personalities of the 
age. Much has been written about him of late, and 
there have been at least two attempts at a biography 
of him for American readers, both claiming to have 
high authority for their accuracy. Both, however, 
fail of their purpose, chiefly by failing to place their 
subject in proper relation to the history of his coun- 
try. Perhaps the time for this cannot come while 
President Diaz is living and almost daily astonishing 
the world by his virile grasp upon the affairs of the 
republic which he has, during the last quarter of a 
century, renovated and advanced to a respectable 
place among the nations of the world. The most re- 
cent attempt at a biography is Don Jose* F. Godoy's 
volume entitled "Porfirio Diaz, the Master Builder 
of a Great Commonwealth" (Putnam). It supplies 
much information regarding the life of its subject, 
particularly in the details of the reforms he has 
instituted in the government of Mexico. But its 
character as a biography is seriously marred by the 
inclusion of seventy pages of " opinions of public 
men," which are by no means needed to sustain the 
reputation of a man whose works will surely live after 
him. — Mr. Frederic Palmer F.R.G.S., devotes the 
first four chapters of his book on " Central America 
and Its Problems " (Moffat, Yard & Co.) to Mexico 
and her relation to her neighbors ; in which he has 
much to say about Diaz. His comments are the 
reverse of eulogistic, though he grants that it is due 
to this man that Mexico has become " a stable, 
dependable, debt-paying, progressive unit among the 
nations of the world." Mr. Palmer is a traveller by 
instinct, and a newspaper correspondent, and his 
narrative of the journey from the Rio Grande to 
Panama is written in true newspaper style. He 
passed through the five countries which we collec- 
tively denominate Central America, and found in 
Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua 
conditions which, as he describes them, should arouse 
world-wide indignation and the application of some- 
thing by way of corrective. The praise he has to 
bestow upon happy Costa Rica and what he finds in 
Panama under American tutelage serves to revive 
the reader's optimism in the Spanish- America of the 
tropics.

itself. Miss Austen's field, Mr. Helm points out, is 
a narrow one, but she tills it perfectly. " Only genius 
could give a vital and enduring fascination to a record 
concerned with the ordinary experiences of a few 
respectable country people almost all of one class." 
Her •' inability to be unintelligible," to adopt a phrase 
of Catharine Morland's, her natural dialogue, " the 
bright people being differentiated from the dull by 
their talk, and not, as in most novels, by the author's 
assurances"; her satiric humor, "rare among wom- 
en," humor " of the essential kind, which is so nearly 
akin to wit that it is often almost identical with it . . . 
brothers who might be mistaken for one another by 
those who do not notice that the one has colder hands 
than the other "; her "wonderfully true presentation 
of the hearts and minds of girls," she herself " the 
most delightful of her own heroines," — all these 
characteristics combine to produce a "perennial 
timeliness " which Mr.Helm finds augmented by her 
avoidance of accessory descriptions. He is a no less 
temperately spoken or sincerely devoted lover than 
Mr. Knightley, and though a reader may discover 
on laying down the book that his sense of "one of 
the supreme literary artists of the world," as Mr. 
"W. L. Phelps has styled the sprightly Jane, is less 
vivid than that induced by the few pages of the 
professor's introduction to the "Chawton" edition 
of the novels, he will not be averse to seeing some 
of his own thoughts affirmed in print. But when 
Mr. Helm denies to the chief characters both passion 
and sentiment many people will no doubt hold with 
Professor Phelps that he commits " the old error of 
assuming that only those persons have passions who 
are unable to control them." Yet the most ardent 
admirer must find it easy to forgive a difference of 
opinion to the man who writes of Godmersham : 
"The spirit of Jane Austen abides in the delicious 
air of this quiet and unspoilt valley, where, when 
the wind blows strongly from the south-east, the 
salt of the sea-breezes mingles with the perfumes of 
the grass and wood smoke as pleasantly as the Attic 
wit of Jane Austen mingles with the sweetness of her 
heroines and the thousand delights of her dialogue." 

Univertitiet and There is no lack of excellent histories 
univertitv life in of Greek and Roman education in 
ancient Greece. French and German ; and there is an 
over-supply in English of superficial compilations 
by " Professors of the History of Education." But 
Dr. John W. H. Walden's volume on " The Univer- 
sities of Ancient Greece " (Scribner) is the first 
considerable English study of the subject written up 
from the sources. The title is slightly misleading, 
as there was nothing which can properly be styled 
a university before Greco-Roman times ; and even 
then the publicly endowed chairs and private schools 
of Rome, Athens, Antioch, and Constantinople, were 
rather " faculties," as the French would call them, 
than universities. However, the intellectual content 
of their instruction was a direct development of the 
teaching in the schools of Isocrates and Plato in 
the Athens of the fourth century B. c. ; and in the 



later centuries " University Life in Ancient Athens " 
(to use the title of Professor Capes's interesting 
sketch published in 1877) presented striking anal- 
ogies with the life of the modern collegian before 
the days of laboratory science. Mr. Walden gives 
a trustworthy and readable account of these later 
schools, of the Professors, their pay, their manner 
of teaching, and the life of the students. " Rushing," 
hazing, tossing in a blanket, "spreads," gowns, 
town-and-gown riots, and even muck-raking the col- 
leges, he shows us are no new thing under the sun. 
The two chief subjects taught were a philosophy 
inclining more and more to rhetoric, and a rhetoric 
slightly tinged with philosophy. As was to be ex- 
pected from the nature of his sources, Mr. Walden 
has most to say of the rhetorical schools of the later 
empire. Rhetoric was taught through the study of 
literature with a view to the attainment of a correct 
classic style and facility in oratory either for its own 
sake or in preparation for the law. The result 
would be anathema to Carlyle, but it was not notably 
inferior to the education given by the literary and 
" culture " courses of a modern university under the 
elective system. It was, in fact, better in so far as 
efficiency was ruthlessly tested by the ability to im- 
provise an effective speech — perhaps a useless but 
certainly not an easy accomplishment. Mr. Walden 
has done his work welL A more philosophic treat- 
ment would have enlarged the earlier chapters deal- 
ing with pre-Roman times, and in particular would 
have emphasized with Von Arnim and Wilamowitz 
the opposition between the rhetorical teaching which 
finally prevailed and the Platonic and Aristotelian 
ideal of the organization of science and a truly scien- 
tific education.

Arts of Great Advocates (Macmil- 
lan), Mr. Francis L. Wellman, of the New York bar, 
gives some good advice to those entering upon, or 
hoping to enter upon, the practice of the law. For 
the most part written originally in lecture form for 
delivery before college students, Mr. Wellman's 
chapters have a clear, ingratiating style, enriched 
with frequent anecdotes from his own court-room 
experience or that of others. He begins by explain- 
ing the difference between an advocate and an office 
lawyer, or, as the English would put it, a barrister 
and a solicitor. Then in successive chapters he treats 
of the physical endowments, the mental equipment, 
and the educational qualifications that an advocate 
should have, the opportunity and rewards awaiting 
him, what preparation should be made for the trial 
of a case, the scene in court, the selecting of jury- 
men, the " opening " to the jury, the fine points of 
direct and cross-examination, the handling of dis- 
crediting documents, and the summing up. The art 
of cross-examination he has already discussed more 
fully in his earlier book under that title. Note- 
worthy is the counsel on an early page to " read

cate; there is likely to be use for every scrap of 
information, and for every grace of mind and deli- 
cacy of feeling acquired by reading good books and 
quantities of them. The author takes occasion to 
quote Senator Ingalls's famous sonnet "Oppor- 
tunity," to which one is tempted to reply by citing 
the more recent and quite differently conceived son- 
net of the same title which graced the pages of the 
January " Atlantic." A statement concerning Lord 
Mansfield, that in his early poverty he all but re- 
nounced the pursuit of the law and " decided upon 
taking orders in the ministry," is likely, from its 
phraseology, to amuse or puzzle Mr. Wellman's Brit- 
ish readers. A little later he gives a new form 
to the old adage attributed to Voltaire, by citing 
Napoleon as saying "that the Almighty always 
seemed to be on the side which had the heaviest 
artillery." The author's account of his first import- 
ant case is one of the best things in this volume of 
unusually interesting legal reminiscence and advice. 

A group of early Prof essor C. T. Winchester, of Wes- 
nineteenth-century ley an University, whose admirable 
English essayists, b i ograp hy G f John Wesley has given 
pleasure to many readers, gathers into a handy 
volume entitled "A Group of English Essayists" 
(Macmillan) a half-dozen chapters which he de- 
scribes as "for the most part, the result of many 
pleasant hours in a college seminary room." After 
a preliminary discussion of "the new essay," the 
critical and discursive article of which Jeffrey may 
be considered the inventor, he advances to the more 
inviting, more personal and intimate essay as writ- 
ten by Lamb and Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt, by De 
Quincey and John Wilson ; for these five masters of 
essay-writing are the subjects of Mr. Winchester's 
chapters after the somewhat tiresomely arbitrary 
Lord Jeffrey has been dismissed. In the treatment 
of Lamb it is to be noted that the author does not 
lament the genial Elia's India House bondage, but 
rather regards his regular employment and assured 
income as fortunate, and points to the long list of 
noted writers " who have managed to unite business 
and literature without detriment to either." His 
admiration for Lamb's style will satisfy the most 
enthusiastic. "No one else in Lamb's day," he 
asserts, "wrote such English, and to find anything 
so perfect you will have to go back to the best pas- 
sages of the English Bible." Incidentally, he twice 
misquoted Lamb, writing " the desk's dull wood " 
instead of " the desk's dead wood." In the remarks 
on De Quincey he goes so far in commendation of his 
style as to say that " he is never verbose," that " he 
never repeats the same thought with needless fulness 
of phrase," though he is "the most prolix of mortals." 
Verboseness, however, or something exceedingly like 
it, is not so very hard to find in De Quincey's super- 
foetated periods. It may be permitted, in a review 
of a book by a professor in the English department 
of a prominent university, to criticize his use of 
financial" (he says of John Wilson's income that 



it " placed him beyond financial anxiety " ) in the 
sense of "pecuniary." Financial, as Webster de- 
fines the word, has to do with finance or public 
revenue. Why not observe the distinction? How- 
ever, an infinitesimal blemish of this sort hardly 
detracts from the excellence of a book which is so 
manifestly the product of careful thought and ripe 
scholarship. _ 

The gambler, Fr0m the meS ° f En g lish sporting 
Tit* habitats journals, apparently, and from other 

and habits. miscellaneous sources, Mr. Ralph 

Nevill has brought together a considerable amount 
of betting and racing history and anecdote, with 
appropriate illustrations from old prints, under the 
title, "Light Come, Light Go" (Macmillan). The 
last decade of George the Second's reign was a 
period of impassioned and reckless gambling among 
persons of quality, and from that time down to the 
close of the last century the author follows the his- 
tory of dicing and card-playing and other forms of 
gaming, chiefly as practised in his own country. 
His narrative has no lack of entertaining anecdote ; 
in fact, it is almost all anecdote, mostly amusing, 
but not seldom sounding a tragic note. Some of 
his illustrations of the gambling mania are strikingly 
odd. In 1813 a literary man of sporting tendencies, 
who had been an assistant master at Rugby, laid a 
wager of five pounds that he could make two thou- 
sand pens in ten hours; and the pens were made 
satisfactorily to the umpire, nearly two hours within 
the stipulated time. Another story, less edifying, 
tells of two gentlemen who undertook to drink 
against each other, one wine and his opponent 
water, on a wager. After a bottle and a half each, 
the water-drinker was forced to desist, being seized 
with illness which confined him to his bed for an 
unstated period. The writer's experience at Monte 
Carlo, and his favorite method of wooing the goddess 
Fortune at that famous resort, will prove interesting, 
perhaps too interesting, to some readers. In his 
closing chapter he expresses himself in favor of 
licensed gambling as opposed to the illicit practices 
so difficult to suppress. A sentence in his first chap- 
ter, where he speaks of gambling as " a conscious 
and deliberate departure from the general aim of 
civilized society, which is to obtain proper value for 
its money," would seem to indicate, on the writer's 
part, a not very exalted conception of " the general 
aim" of civilization. The nine colored pictures and 
the fourteen in black and white are spirited and 
appear to reflect the manners (and costumes) of 
high society a century and more ago. 



"The Last American Frontier"

Logan Paxson of the University of 
Michigan, tells the story of the westward movement, 
chiefly from 1821 to 1885, in the settlement of our

City. Here, at the bend in the Missouri River, which 
had thus far furnished a water highway toward the 
sunset, the westward movement was stayed for a 
while. The author gives the history of various over- 
land trails, of Indian wars and the government's 
treatment of the dispossessed redskins, of the for- 
mation of new territories, and of the final triumph 
of the railway over this seemingly impossible stretch 
of desert and mountain. The significance of the 
frontier in American history was the subject of a 
paper by Professor Frederick J. Turner, in the 
"Annual Report of the American Historical Asso- 
ciation" for 1893 ; and this the author of the book 
under review notes as containing "the fundamental 
ideas upon which all recent careful work in western 
history has been based." No full history of the trans- 
Mississippi region has yet been written ; but Mr. 
Paxson, while modestly calling his own volume a 
"sketch," expresses in his preface the hope that 
before many years he may be able " to exploit in a 
larger and more elaborate form the mass of detailed 
information" upon which "The Last American 
Frontier " is based. That the sources for such a 
work are by no means scanty is made clear in an 
appended note of six fine-print pages. Illustrations 
and maps have been judiciously introduced, and an 
index is added. The book is emphatically a careful 
and scholarly piece of work. 

Lore and legend A painstaking piece of hagiology has 
of England's been executed by Mrs. Henry Hulst 
patron saint. (Cornelia Steketee Hulst) in her 
" St. George of Cappadocia in Legend and History " 
(David Nutt, London). The origin of what may be 
called the St. George myth is lost in the haze of 
Aryan legend. The story is now regarded by cer- 
tain scholars versed in such matters as an Aryan 
myth capable of a solar interpretation. But what- 
ever its origin, and however important or unimpor- 
tant to trace the dragon-slayer back to the very first 
mind that conceived his popularly attractive attri- 
butes, Mrs. Hulst has collected all that need concern 
most of us in regard to this legendary hero and saint. 
The common version of the story as accepted by the 
Roman church is first examined, then the version 
sanctioned by the Greek church; and then some 
account is given of the spread of the worship of St. 
George and of his influence, and the further evolution 
of the legend in allegory and romance. From the 
Persian legend of Mithra to a cartoon in "Lustige 
Blatter" entitled "St. Teddy in Combat with the 
Dollar Dragon" is a long journey; but Mrs. Hulst 
has accomplished it, and has enlivened the account 
of her progress with numerous pictures from many 
sources. In her concluding list of references — a 
hundred and twenty authorities are cited in the body 
of the book — one fails to find the Byzantine hagi- 
ologist Metaphrastes, whose account of St. George 
is substantially the one adopted in the Roman "Acta 
Sanctorum." The work is, nevertheless, a triumph 
of diligence. It is very attractively executed in its 
mechanical features. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" A Mother's List of Books for Children," compiled 
by Mrs. Gertrude Weld Arnold, is published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. It is the revision of a privately- 
printed publication, which the compiler first prepared 
for use in her own home. " The endeavor has been 
made to choose those fairy tales which are most free 
from horrible happenings, and to omit all writings which 
tolerate unkindness to animals." Colonel Higginson 
writes an introduction warmly commending the book. 
The titles are annotated, and are grouped according to 
the ages of their readers — from two to fourteen. The 
selection is one of the best we have ever seen, and no 
mother should be without it. 

In a short monograph entitled " Was William Shak- 
spere a Gentleman ? " Mr. Samuel A. Tannenbaum 
shows that a coat-of-arms was granted to John Shak- 
spere in 1596, and that the application in 1599 was not 
for an original grant of arms but for permission to 
impale with the Shakspere arms those of the ancient 
and noble family of Arden. Hitherto it has been gen- 
erally assumed that this second application was for an 
" exemplification " or " recognition " of what had been 
an alleged grant, and that Shakspere used influence to 
gratify his heraldic ambitions. Thereby a blot, if such 
it may be called, is removed from the Shakspere 
'scutcheon, and all 's gules again. 

A monumental one-volume war record has recently 
been brought to completion in Col. Frederick H. Dyer's 
" Compendium of the War of the Rebellion " (Cedar 
Rapids, la.: Torch Press). Colonel Dyer has spent 
forty years in collecting data, tabulating and arranging 
it, and revising and correcting his material, until he has 
produced a compact repository of all essential facts and 
dates pertaining to the men and military organizations 
engaged in the war, and the actions, big and little, in 
which they took part. The sources are all official, thus 
insuring the greatest possible accuracy. The arrange- 
ment is in three parts : Organization — covering troops 
furnished, losses, brigade, division, corps, and army 
formation, commanders ; Action — covering every battle, 
engagement, and skirmish, showing troops involved in 
each, and losses when they were officially reported ; and 
History — giving the complete story of the regiments 
and companies participating in the struggle. To the 
statistician or historian of the Civil War period, the 
Compedium will doubtless prove invaluable; and as a 
reference work it will fill a constantly increasing 
demand. 

"In English Homes," that sumptuous account of 
English domestic architecture, has now reached its 
third volume (Scribner). Mr. Charles Latham, as 
before, furnishes an abundance of clear and beautiful 
photographs, and Mr. H. Avray Tipping provides the 
textual comment. The period covered is that of Palla- 
dianism, introduced from Italy by Leoni, most skilfully 
practised by Inigo Jones, and exerting a dominating 
influence over English architecture up to the time of 
Sir William Chambers. A comprehensive introduction 
characterizes the period and gives brief biographical 
notes of its best-known builders and designers. Forty 
country houses are then depicted, with historical data 
and as much architectural comment as the merit of 
each warrants. Interior decorations by men like Gib- 
bons, Verrio, Laguerre, Kent, Robert Adam, and Chip- 
pendale, receive due attention in picture and text.

library form, with reproductions of the striking old 
illustrations. 

Messrs. Cassell & Co. publish a third edition of 
" The Home Life of the Ancient Greeks," as translated

H. Bliimner. It is an interesting and copiously illus- 
trated volume. 

A new edition, on thin paper, of the books of Mr.

" Jude the Obscure " are the volumes now at hand. 
Each volume has a photogravure frontispiece. 

" Sun Tzu on the Art of War," which is described as

" Reconstruction in Texas," by Dr. Charles William 
Ramsdell, is a bulky monograph published by Columbia 
University in the series of " Studies in History, Eco-

The death of Professor William Graham Sumner, 
which occurred on the twelfth of this month, deprives 
Yale University of one of her oldest and most useful 
teachers, and the country of one of its clearest and most 
authoritative writers in the fields of social and political 
science. Born in 1840, he graduated at Yale in 1863, 
and continued his studies at Oxford and Gottingen. 
After a few years of tutorship at Yale, he was ordained 
as a clergyman of the Episcopal faith, and for some 
time was rector of a church in New Jersey. In 1872 
he returned to Yale as professor of social and political

THE CROSSWAYS 

By HELEN R. MARTIN, author of "Tillie: 
A Mennonite Maid." 

This is the most dramatic and most absorbing novel Mrs. 
Martin has written since her famous " Tillie." As the 
■well-known critic, Mr. Frederic Taber Cooper, says, in 
The Bookman, " It is immensely worth reading, not only 
for its masterly delineation of local types, but also for its 
portrayal of that delicate, yet unbreakable, spirit with 
which a frail woman finally bends a stubborn man to her 
will." 

Edwin Markham says that " you will not find a more 
thought-evoking story on the shelves of the season."

I 1 By DAVID K. WATSON, LL.B., LL.D. I 1 

l C0MPREHENSIVE l Of the Columbus, Ohio, Bar 1 EXHAUST ' VE I 



An exhaustive, well-balanced, comprehensive treatise on the Constitution of the United States, tracing the out- 
lines of the Constitution from the meeting of the first Colonial Congress in 1774 to the convention which framed 
the Constitution in 1787. A complete history is given of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence; of 
the correspondence of Jefferson, Adams and other statesmen and members of the Colonial Congress relating to 
that subject, together with sketches of the men who composed the Constitutional Convention. The history of 
the Constitution begins with the preamble, of which there is given the most complete history ever written. Each 
article is then considered in its order, section by section and clause by clause. This arrangement is followed 
throughout the work. 

The historical portion of the work is based largely upon the proceedings of the convention which framed 
the Constitution, every important subject being traced to its origin. 

The subject of Interstate Commerce is most exhaustively dealt with from the earliest Federal opinion to 
the present day. The subject of amendments extensively discussed. 

The work also contains chapters on the Federal Judiciary Before the Constitution; the Power of the Judiciary 
to Declare Laws Unconstitutional; the Police Power; Corporations; Combinations; the Acquisition and Govern- 
ment of National Domain. 

Copious footnotes; over one thousand opinions of the courts referred to. (Ready May 20.)

This little book is an analysis by a man 
who has studied Lincoln's career with a 
view of finding an explanation for it. The 
author makes clear that the great lesson of 
Lincoln's life was patience. 

" As an appreciation of Lincoln it is the estimate 
of a fine mind, after exhaustive research into a per- 
sonally fascinating and absorbing subject, and, his- 
torically, the book may be set down as absolutely 
dependable. In all the mass of Lincoln biography 
we hold it as far and away the most gratifying and 
satisfying." — The Bloomington Bulletin.

Some Remarkable Recent Publications 



FACT AND THEORY 
Promenades of an Impressionist B y jame. Huneker 

The field of the writer's promenades is mainly modern. They lead among 
such men as Cezanne, Rops, Monticelli, Rodin, Carriere, Degas, and Sorolla. 
If the author turns back as far as Greco, Velasquez, and even Botticelli, it is 
because they are, in a sense, modern discoveries. 

" The many persons who wish to learn something tangible about modern 
artists will be glad to turn to Mr. Huneker's ' Promenades of an Impression- 
ist.' " — The N. Y. Sun. 

" We have many writers on art subjects in these days, but none so sugges- 
tive as Mr. Huneker. After reading any of his sketches one is seized with a 
burning desire to see the pictures he describes and that is about as great a 
compliment as could be paid to any critic." — Philadelphia Inquirer. 

" It is a companionable book, full of strange and unerpected learning that 
is without a suggestion of pedantry. It ought to find its way into the baggage 
of many lovers of culture when they invade Europe this year." — The N. Y. 
Evening Sun. $1.50 net; postpaid, $1.65. 

The Indian and His Problem b y Francis e. Leu PP 

The writer was for four years Commissioner of Indian Affairs. This fact, 
taken with his life-long interest in the Indian, marks him as the man of all 
men fitted to write on this subject. 

" Mr. Leupp writes authoritatively and out of a large and practical experi- 
ence and his book will attract the attention of all thinking people." — Spring- 
field Union. 

" No clearer statement of the case has ever been presented to the Ameri- 
can public. Mr. Leupp's book is highly entertaining from beginning to end, 
apart from its intrinsic power as a contribution to the Indian question. He 
surveys the field broadly, and yet touches it in detail, drawing from his official 
experience for illustrations and examples to demonstrate his larger proposi- 
tions. He gets down to the fundamental basis at every point." — The Wash- 
ington Evening Star. $2.00 net; postpaid, $2.20. 

Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years 

With Memoir by Mrs. Hoffman B V Richard Hoffman 

Delightful memories of musicians and musical affairs in this country and En- 
gland. The account of Mendelssohn's leading of the "Elijah" at Birming- 
ham ; of Jenny Lind and her appearance at Castle Garden and her tour of this 
country under P. T. Bamum; of Thalberg, Von Bulow, Gottschalk, Liszt. 
These and many other reminiscences of the audiences, musicians, concerts of 
the country fifty years ago, make up a fascinating book. 

Illustrated, $1.50 net; postpaid, $1.65. 

Privilege and Democracy in America Frederic* c. Howe 

"We think ' Privilege and Democracy in America' should be read by all 
voters." — Charleston News and Courier. 

"Mr. Howe's book is an earnest and thoughtful contribution to the discus- 
sion of the present social and economic disturbances, of which the increased 
cost of living is a pressing and obvious manifestation." — N. Y. Globe. 

" Distinguished by its acuteness of historical observation, its truth of pre- 
mise, its logic of deduction, and its clearness of diction." — Washington Herald. 

$1.50 net; postpaid, $1.65. 

Our Garden Flowers B y Harriet l. Keeier 

With 96 full-page illustrations from photographs and 186 illustrations from 
drawings. Full of information, practical, tested, systematically arranged, and 
indexed. With the same high intelligence, deep knowledge, remarkable thor- 
oughness, and unique charm that made famous her other books — " Our Native 
Trees " and " Our Northern Shrubs " — this popular study of garden flowers is 
written. $2.00 nel ; (postage extra). 



Little Aliens 



FICTION 

The Angel of 
Lonesome Hill 

By Frederick Landis 
Author of " The Glory of His Coun- 
try," Twice Congressman under 
the Roosevelt Administrations. 
A striking presentation of a domi- 
nant personality of to-day. It shows 
him inflexible in action, but it shows, 
too, his depth of sympathy, and his 
intuitive sense of justice. It shows 
him in the White House, but within 
easy reach of the farm, and it tells 
how an old farmer came to him to 
ask a pardon — and got it. 

50 cents net; postpaid 55 cents. 

By 
Myra Kelly 
Author of " Little Citizens." 

Here for the last time she tells of 
the little East Side foreigners, the 
comedy and tragedy of their lives, 
with an infinite comprehension and 
extraordinary depth of sympathy. 
The stories are full of pathos and 
humor, her childish characters so 
strikingly portrayed become live 
children to the reader. 

Illustrated. $1.50. 

The Silent Call 

By Edwin Milton Royle 

A story of the Squaw Man's son, by 
the author of the eminently success- 
ful drama, " The Squaw Man." This 
is a story of the West. In its pages 
live and act such characters as have 
made the West tbe land of romance. 
The hero — the Squaw Man's son — 
is a half-breed whose father was an 
Englishman, of noble family. He 
was educated in the English schools 
and trained for the army, but when 
this novel opens he has heard the 
"Silent Call," and is back near the 
ranch where he was born. Beyond 
all, this is his love story, written 
with all the emotional intensity and 
delicate feeling that distinguished 
the "Squaw Man." 

Illustrated. $1.50. 

The Black Bear 

By William H. Wright 
Author of " The Grizzly Bear." 

This is the story, first, of the black 
bear, of his habits, adventures, and 
characteristics. Then, it is a study 
of black bears in general, from the 
point of view of the student of nat- 
ural history and the hunter. Mr. 
Wright has given here an extraordi- 
narily interesting and valuable ac- 
count of the best-known variety of 
bears in this country.

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH 

By R. G. USHER, Ph.D.

assistance of such persons as the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishops of London, Oxford, Durham, and 
others. It will make a wide appeal to Catholics, to economists, to lawyers, and to historians because it deals with an

Tent Life in Siberia 



A New Account of an Old Undertaking. Adventures among the Koraks

Author of " Siberia, and the Exile System," etc. 

8vo. With 32 Full-page Illustrations and 2 Maps. $2. SO net. 

This is a revised and much enlarged edition of Mr. Kennan's well-known book, which has been in steady

Mr. Holder has fished in the deep sea of the Pacific and in 
the mountain streams that are hidden away in the high 
Sierras and Cascades, protected from the rude intrusions 
of the crowd and accessible only to the seasoned moun- 
taineer. The tussles he has had with game fish, retold in 
the dramatic style of which Mr. Holder is the master, will 
thrill the most phlegmatic reader. 



The River and I

8vo. Fully Illustrated. 

Under this rather unusual title, John G. Neihardt, the 
Nebraska poet, tells the story of his descent of the Mis- 
souri in quest of exercise, adventure, and impressions. 
That he got all he bargained for, and perhaps a little 
more, is not to be wondered at. Being a poet as well as a 
man of action, the adventurer had an experience which 
his temperament and tastes qualified him to enjoy to the 
full — and his recital makes as thrilling a narrative as one 
is apt to find.

The Story of a South African Girl.

picture live.

The qualities of style that made Mrs. Huntington's first

of The Sovereign Good. The stirring analysis of a soul is 
presented with charming humor and with unfailing grace.

Recent Progress in the Study of 
Variation, Heredity and Evolution 

New and Enlarged Edition 

By ROBERT HEATH LOCKE, M.A. 

Illustrated. Price, $1.50 net. 
Readers who remember the highly theoretic and contro- 
versial character of the early works on Evolution will find 
this book an interesting measure of the difference in meth- 
ods of investigation as well as of the advance in knowledge 
along these lines of study. Twenty years of patient experi- 
menting in biological laboratories, and the work of DeVries. 
Mendel, and Galton have created a fund of definite inform- 
ation to replace what was called a quarter of a century ago, 
*" the Darwinian hypothesis." Xo subject in the whole 
range of the physical sciences has commanded so much 
interest as this, and the present volume with its compre- 
hensive view of the whole field will appeal to a wide circle 
of readers. The chapters on Recent Cytology and Eugenics 
are especially interesting. 



On Everything 



By H. BELLOC 
Price, il.25 net. 
These short papers — the volume contains no fewer than 
forty — are episodes rather than essays ; witty and compact 
delineations of ideas and incidents as a more frugal author 
might have set them down in a notebook for future develop- 
ment. The impulse of lavishness which prints them in the 
present concentrated form has made a book of unusual 
charm.

A History of Gardening in England 

By The Hon. Mr.. EVELYN CECIL 

Illustrated. Price. $3.50 net. 
Gardening in England is so ancient a science that its 
early records have an antiquarian rather than a practical 
value, yet the essentially permanent nature of garden lore 
crops up on every page. The gardener in Westchester, or 
Orange, or on Long Island, must still plant his bulbs ac- 
cording to XlVth century directions. 3 inches deep with a 
" Dybble " and 

'• Thay wold be sette yn the moneth of September 
Three days by-fore seynt Mary day natyryte." 

Beginning with the interesting relics of monastic gar- 
dening, the book follows the centuries to the dawn of land- 
scape gardening and formal work in the modern school. 
Interest is added by the fact that specimens of every period 
described still survive in England and are reproduced for 
the delight of those who love gardens of any period. 

Health Progress and Administration 
in the West Indies 

By SIR RUBERT W. BOYCE 

Illustrated. Price, $3.50 net. 

This writer on sanitation has gathered in a volume the 
results of an extended trip made last year to the West Indies 
to investigate the epidemic of yellow fever prevailing there 
at that time. The assistance of officials of every rank and 
the trained observation of the writer have united to make 
an unusually accurate and detailed record of what may be 
accomplished by modern methods in the prophylaxis of 
tropical diseases. While the sanitary work is necessa- 
rily similar to that of the United States engineers on the 
Isthmus, there are interesting points of difference which 
will repay study.

THE RAMRODDERS 



By HOLMAN DAY. 

At last comes a political novel that tells an exciting story. The spirit of youth — in love and in affairs — is bound up in 
the life struggle of the " easy " boss — the kind who casually looks on at a " perfectly managed " election. This big novel 
is remarkable also for its humor. Not in years has there been a character to equal Thelismer Thornton in pointed, quaint, 
incisive sayings. He is a Maine type pictured full-length in this novel and his philosophy will be quoted from Bangor to 
San Francisco. " I'd have played the game different with angels — but I could n't find the angels."

HEARTS CONTENDING 



By GEORGE SCOCK 

A new force in the literature of the world is born with this romance by a new writer. These pages reveal an atmosphere 
of pastoral simplicity, people simple and strong — Germans living in a Pennsylvania valley. But the story in spite of its 
simplicity, is tremendous, inexorable, dramatic, true. Job Heilig is the patriarch of the Heiligthal, prosperous, strong 
and exceedingly just. His great fault is his undertaking to manage the lives of his children, three sons and one daughter. 
A cousin, Saul, a school teacher, lives with the family, and he and the daughter are in love. This is the beginning of a 
story tinged with fate, moving on to a triumphant end.

BIANCA'S DAUGHTER 

By JUSTUS MILES FORMAN 

Here is a society story — plus a mystery. Both of these Mr. 
Forman does well, but never before has he done them with 
such distinction. A girl born to wealth who has lived in 
seclusion with her taciturn father comes to New York and 
meets — a man, naturally. But when her father hears the 
man's name he is furious — strange complications come 
about and the story rushes on in a very original fashion.

A story, intensely dramatic, set in the brilliant European

both in love with a Princess, a beautiful young widow. Dis- 
covering the Count's infatuation, a Grand Duchess, his 
former friend, contrives to have him sent on a mission to 
the Caucasus. Others become involved in the plot, and the 
story never halts in its march to the dramatic end. The 
novel has fire and force and the literary finish always

MARK TWAIN. 



The report of Mark Twain's death on the 
21st of April, this time not "greatly exag- 
gerated " but sadly and literally true, was the 
occasion of heart-felt grief to the entire nation, 
we may almost say to the whole world. No 
American of our time was more widely known ; 
no other American writer lately among the liv- 
ing had endeared himself to so large and cos- 
mopolitan an audience. His life, ended midway 
in its seventy-fifth year, had been rich in human 
experience, had fulfilled the season of mellow 
fruitfulness, and had given literary expression, 
as few other lives have done, to the qualities of 
buoyancy and independence so characteristic of 
the typical American temperament. It was also 
a life which, in its personal aspects, revealed 
the qualities of manliness and sympathy, was 
admirable in its public and private relations, 
and bore with fortitude the buffets of ill-fortune. 
There are tests of character which few men can 
suffer without some show of weakness ; his char- 
acter they served only to sweeten and strengthen. 

Mark Twain's life may be divided into two 
nearly equal parts. Of the first part, which 
includes his boyhood days, his experiences as a 
journeyman printer and editor, his brief career 
as a Mississippi pilot, his briefer career as a 
Confederate soldier, and his adventures in the 
mining-camps and rude settlements of the West, 
we have the most vivid of records in his books 
— in " Tom Sawyer " and " Huckleberry 
Finn " and M Roughing It," and in the count- 
less short stories and sketches which began with 
" The Jumping Frog " and are probably not 
yet at an end, for only a part of the work which 
he humorously styles his " Autobiography " has 
been put into print. Those early days left him 
with a fund of recollections upon which his 
drafts were honored — as was similarly the case 
with Bret Harte — for long years after the 
experiences themselves had become old (although 
not unhappy) far off things. As the recorder 
of these phases of pioneer life which he knew 
at first hand, and of which he almost alone has 
preserved for us the very form and pressure, 
we are immeasurably in his debt. There are 
few things that we know as well as what it was 
to be a boy in a Missouri country town, a futile 
skirmisher in the early days of the Civil War, 
and a traveller on the lower Mississippi, few

THE DIAJL 



[May 1, 



bygone types that are as real to us as the miners 
and stage-coach drivers and politicians and bar- 
room loafers of the untutored West of the mid- 
century. The writings in which these things have 
been preserved for us are Mark Twain's best, be- 
cause they are his raciest and least self-conscious. 

The next best group of his books is provided 
by " The Innocents Abroad," " A Tramp 
Abroad," and " Following the Equator," the 
three extensive records of unconventional travel. 
Yet in these the touch of sophistication is seen, 
and becomes progressively pronounced with each 
succeeding narrative. The second is not as 
good as the first, and the third is distinctly 
weaker than the second, more artificial in its 
conception and more forced in its humor. When 
the author transplanted himself to the East for 
permanent residence in the seventies, he aban- 
doned the primal sources of his inspiration, and 
never developed others of comparable import- 
ance. Going farther and farther afield in search 
of fresh material, he illustrated anew the myth 
of Antaeus, and displayed a pitiable weakness. 
Over some of his later flounderings in the alien 
elements of literary criticism, history, and met- 
aphysics, it were best discreetly to draw a veil. 
There was in him a streak of the Philistine 
which might have remained undetected had he 
"kept to his last," but which was sharply 
revealed when he infringed upon the domain of 
intellectual and scholarly concerns. 

The present is not, however, the best occasion 
for dwelling upon Mark Twain's limitations, or 
for emphasizing the ephemeral character of a 
considerable part of his work. A fair share of 
that work, at least, stands upon a level so high 
as to be in no danger of passing out of sight. 
Up to an advanced point in his career, he grew 
steadily in power and wisdom ; his sympathies 
became ever broader and deeper, and his expres- 
sive faculty kept pace with the larger demands 
that were made upon it. From the exuberant 
journalist who gave us entertainment in his 
earlier days he developed into something like a 
sage to whom we came to look no less for counsel 
than for amusement. We learned to detect in 
his homely speech the movings of a fine spirit, 
instinct with the nobler promptings of democ- 
racy, hating shams and ostentatious vulgarity, 
gentle and gracious in its quieter moods, but 
fanned to burning indignation when facing some 
monstrous wickedness, such as the corruption 
of our political life, or the dastardly act of the 
American soldier in the Philippines who be- 
trayed his rescuer and shamelessly boasted of 
the shameful deed, or the infamy of the royal 



libertine who distilled a fortune from the blood 
of the miserable natives of the Congo. Even 
more than by his strictly literary work, he 
earned our gratitude for the brave words which 
he spoke upon such themes as these, words that 
cleared the moral atmosphere and made us see 
things in the light of naked truth. 

Nor should we, in our tribute to the man, 
forget the silent heroism with which he endured 
loss of fortune in his advancing years, and 
shouldered the burden of a debt incurred by the 
rascality of his associates, a debt for which he 
was only indirectly responsible, and which he 
might have evaded without serious impairment 
of his reputation. The strenuous labors of the 
years of lecturing and writing which enabled 
him to discharge in full the shadowy obligations 
which he then assumed took their toll of his 
vitality, but won for him an esteem higher than 
is ever the reward of the artist alone. This 
action ranks with the similar examples set by 
Scott and Curtis ; it is one of those shining 
deeds that reveal the man himself, in contradis- 
tinction to the works by which most men of 
creative genius are contented to be known. 

The attitude of criticism toward Mark Twain 
as a writer has undergone a slow but complete 
change during the past thirty years. From 
being thought of simply as a " funny man," of 
the kin of Josh Billings and Artemus Ward, he 
has gradually come to be recognized as one of 
our foremost men of letters. This is a pro- 
foundly significant transformation of opinion, 
and to account for it fully would require a more 
careful analysis than we here have space to 
undertake. The recognition has been unduly 
delayed, partly because so much of his output 
has been utterly unworthy of his best self, and 
partly because his work in its totality is of so 
nondescript a character. The conventional way 
to distinction in literature is by the fourfold 
path of the poem, the play, the novel, and the 
essay. Occasionally, also, an historian compels 
literary recognition. But Mark Twain was 
neither a poet nor a playwright nor an historian. 
He was hardly a novelist, either, for his share 
in " The Gilded Age " does not seriously count, 
and his work in the form of fiction is not 
remarkable as story-telling pure and simple. If 
we are to group him at all, it must be with the 
essayists, using that term elastically enough to 
include with him our own Irving, and such 
Englishmen as Swift and Carry le. We must 
either do this, or fall back upon the sui generis 
solution of the problem. Again, if we make a 
subdivision of the essayist class for the humor- 



1910.] 



THE DIAJj 



307 



ists alone, we encounter the difficulty offered by 
our obstinate association of that term with mere 
fun-making and the appeal to the lighter inter- 
ests of human nature. Obviously, our subdi- 
vision must take yet another step, and admit 
that, on the one hand, there are humorists who 
make us laugh and have hardly any other 
influence over us, and humorists who are also 
creative artists, and critics of life in the deeper 
sense, and social philosophers whose judgments 
are of weight and import. If we are to classify 
Mark Twain at all, it must be with the latter 
distinguished company ; and his title to kinship 
with the three English writers above mentioned, 
and even with such alien prototypes as Aristo- 
phanes and Rabelais and Cervantes, is at least 
not scornfully to be put aside. 



THE 



INTERREGNUM IN AMERICAN 
LITERATURE. 



BJORNSTJE RNE BJORNSON 

The survivor of the Norwegian Dioscuri — if a 
classical similitude be permissible in the case of two 
such sturdy Goths as Ibsen and Bjornson — closed 
his eyes in Paris on the 26th of April. His death- 
bed was surrounded by the members of his family, 
and he passed peacefully away after an illness of 
many months. A less vigorous frame would not 
have gone through the crisis of last February, 
when his death was hourly expected. At that time, 
the critical journals of the world (The Dial 
included) paid their respects to his fame, and he 
bad the unusual experience of living to read (if he 
cared for such entertainment) an extensive collection 
of what were, to all intents and purposes, his obitu- 
ary tributes. His life was continued well along into 
his seventy-eighth year; and few lives have been 
so worthily lived, or made so helpful to human 
kind. His nation ( become a nation largely through 
his efforts) mourns him as it mourned Ibsen, but 
with a difference; for he inspired love in no less 
measure than respect, and was a national figure in 
a deeper and more intimate sense than was ever his 
famous compeer. And the world mourns with 
Norway, for he has been a figure of cosmopolitan 
significance since that time in the seventies when 
his outlook became broadened, and he plunged into 
the main current of the stream of modern thought. 
Politics, sociology, science, education, and religion, 
have all been enriched by his activities and his 
intuitions. Yet it is probably as the singer of the 
people's songs, and as the artist who portrayed their 
simple lives and vivified their heroic and legendary 
past, that his fame will chiefly endure. Other ages 
will have new problems to face, and new prophets 
will arise to give guidance for their solution; but 
the poet of " Ja, vi elsker " and " Over de Hoje 
Fjelde," the creator of " SynnOve Solbakken" and 
"Arne," the restorer of Sigurd Slembe and Olaf 
the Holy, is reasonably sure of immortality. 



"Authors, do not read your contemporaries," was 
the sage advice of Matthew Arnold. Authors, do 
not write about your contemporaries, is perhaps a 
better counsel, and one which I have tried to follow. 
I used to read my contemporaries religiously, — and 
I ought to have had a pension for my efforts in this 
line. But I did not think I could serve them or the 
public by criticising them, and for a good while I 
have busied myself with the things which I know 
are abiding. 

But even to one who sports his oak to the present, 
a great silence outside may become audible, a great 
vacancy may make itself felt. I suppose everyone 
is agreed that we have in literature no recognized 
kings or princes of the blood, no glittering court 
which fixes all eyes. And that we had such regali- 
ties in the past, powers that were potent in their own 
day, is also recognized. What has come over us ? 

The late Thomas Bailey Aldrich, master of a 
magic flute, said, in a letter dated in 1891, that for 
the next twenty years poetry was going to have a 
hard time in America. Never was there a truer 
prophecy. But why? 

The commonly received explanation is the materi- 
alism of the age, which in turn is due to the great 
advances in the physical sciences and to the enormous 
increase in wealth. Such explanation leaves me 
unconvinced. Mankind is always, in the main, 
material — is chiefly concerned with getting a living 
and having a good time. And other ages have 
equalled ours in scientific discovery, and, propor- 
tionally, in wealth. No recent material discovery is 
on the same plane with the finding of America and 
the establishment of the rotundity of the earth. No 
late scientific hypothesis equals the Copernican 
theory or the law of gravitation. No modern inven- 
tion is so far-reaching in consequences as the inven- 
tions of printing, of the mariner's compass, or of 
gunpowder. And in the ages which saw these marvel- 
lous developments of science and discovery, religion 
and imagination, literature and art creation, walked 
abreast of the other activities of man. People did 
not stop going to church, or singing love or festal 
songs, or recounting the heroic legends of their race, 
because of Columbus or Galileo or Guttenberg, or 
Newton. H anything, the achievements of these 
men stimulated the mind of the world. 

There is perhaps more plausibility in the wealth 
theory. Wealth, really, only respects wealth ; and 
intellect, really, only respects intellect. The person- 
ages of the two camps do not come together very well. 
And of late the masses, dazzled by money and its 
uses, have weakened in fealty to intellect and turned 
their whole worship to the Golden Calf. But rich 
men have often stood by literature and art. The 
traditions of the English aristocracy, for instance, 
have always been to foster these — to the extent, at 
least, of buying books and objects of art. And rich 
nations have often gone art mad. The Athenians

[May 1, 



did not become an art people until they acquired 
the spoils of the Persian War — until they won the 
gardens of the Cyclades, the commerce of the 
Mediterranean. No, — nations like individuals must 
be born with certain faculties or tendencies. "What 
is the best way to become beautiful?" asked a young 
girl of her doctor. " Well, my dear, the best way 
I know is to be born pretty." Perhaps America 
was behind the door when the fatal gift of beauty 
was given out. 

But these are large considerations, and may be 
tossed about in a good many ways. It is better to 
come down to the actually appraisable tendencies 
and influences that have made for what at least 
seems to be a period of comparative dulness and 
poverty in American literature. 

The preaching and practice of the dogmas of 
realism may account for some part of our weakness. 
I have never been able to attach much importance 
to the fanciful labels of classic, romantic, realistic, 
symbolic, and the like, which writers give them- 
selves and fight for. There is a real distinction 
between the different forms of literature, between 
tragedy and comedy, the novel and the play, narra- 
tive and lyric poetry. But all literature is based on 
human nature, on the spectacle of the world, on the 
thoughts and dreams of men. The reports of these 
things differ according to the talents of the authors, 
but not by any set formulas. The Agamemnon is 
just as real as the last novel founded on the same 
theme of the unfaithful wife. So while our doctri- 
naires have filled our ears with the fury of their 
words, I do not believe they have done much harm 
beyond withdrawing writers too much from what 
Rossetti called " fundamental brain-work " and mak- 
ing them trust too much to observation. Miss Ellen 
Terry, in her Autobiography, says that when she 
first played Ophelia she went to the madhouse for 
models. But she found that she had to imagine first 
and observe afterwards. That, I judge, is really the 
law of all art. You must know what you want to do, 
and then take from nature the materials for doing it. 

A more important cause for our comparative 
failure in pure literature is the American appetite 
for the didactic. Other and perhaps sounder nations 
are content to take part of their instruction in life 
from art, to absorb it from the examples in great 
literature. But with us nothing will do but the 
direct hortatory word. Dean Swift left his money 
to the Irish people to found a madhouse, — 
" To prove by one satiric touch 
No nation needed it so much." 

Possibly American authors have expended the 
exchequer of their intellects on the didactic, for a 
similar reason. Everyone preaches in America — 
our Presidents, the presidents of our colleges, maga- 
zine editors, and so on down the line. No wonder 
the clergy are overslaughed. They don't get half 
a chance. The word is taken from their mouths. 
Now the critic would be a fool indeed who would 
decry the province and power of the didactic in 
literature, or deny the nobility and usefulness of 



the works it has brought forth. Two poets so 
important and opposed as Pope and Wordsworth 
are liege subjects of the Lord of Didacticism. And 
our own Emerson holds his titles from the same 
hand. To me it seems, however, that all these men 
are takers of second prizes. In pure literature, 
didacticism should be the sauce, not the piece de 
resistance. The business of literature of the central 
type is to depict life — life real, great, grotesque, 
charming, ridiculous ; life ideal, noble, and beautiful. 
And an overplus of moralizing spoils both the truth 
and beauty of the picture. Men of letters can afford 
to leave the direct preaching and enforcement of 
morals to the clergy, who are trained and paid to do 
such work. 

If Beauty is the beginning of literature, tragedy 
is its culmination. It is certain that we do not love 
tragedy to-day in America. We put it aside as 
something black and unpleasant and intruding, like 
cockroaches or the cimex lectutarius. That we had 
the feeling for it, the stern joy in it, in the past, is 
also sure. We read and applauded our great writers 
who explored the heights and abysses of human 
nature, who faced all the horrors and deaths of 
spirit and body, and rose above them, winged, ex- 
alted, victorious. As long as we refuse to deal with 
such losses and gains of life, we doom our literature 
to mediocrity. 

Some of our critics explain our deficiency in great- 
ness by the irreverence of our minds, by the lowness 
and vulgarity of our humor. Now I do not think 
our humor is irreverent enough or low enough or 
vulgar enough for that. Perhaps our humorists have 
not got it in them ; but more probably they, like Dr. 
Holmes, do not dare to be as funny as they can. 
Public opinion compels them to be decent. Wit 
can be as genteel as it pleases ; but great humor — 
the world-upsetting kind — can hardly exist with- 
out grossness. It is the foil to the noble side of 
life, and what is the use of a foil which tries to 
look as much as possible like its principal. Matthew 
Arnold, Puritan and precisian as he really was, has 
some coarse though not gross scenes in his Friend- 
ship's Garland — and his whole heart went out in 
critical approval of Burns's " Jolly Beggars " and the 
bestialities of Faust and Aristophanes. He knew 
what literature was, and always declined to accept 
dishwater or weak tea as efficient substitutes. Of our 
own men, Irving in the past was not afraid to be low. 
Of course all the great humorists of the world — Aris- 
tophanes, Boccaccio, Cervantes, Rabelais, Moliere, 
Shakespeare, Sterne, Fielding, Goldsmith, Burns, 
Goethe, and Heine — have been utterly contemptuous 
of decency and the proprieties when they wanted to 
give the reality of the animal side of human life. 

The magazines, — taking them in full — have 
done a good deal to depress the vitality and destroy 
the originality of our recent literature. A novel 
writer has his direct appeal to the public, but for 
the poet, essayist, or short-story writer, the maga- 
zine has been the only path of access. This has 
placed a great power and responsibility in the edi- 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

tor's hands. But for the most part these miscellanies 
are commercial undertakings. To pay, they must 
appeal to a wide puhlic; and to reach this public 
they must give it what it understands and can appre- 
ciate. There must therefore be an inevitable level- 
ling down that there may be some uplift. I have no 
doubt that the editors do their best to reconcile lit- 
erature with an appeal to the masses. But their 
best, a little way off, does not loom large. I remem- 
ber once being shut up alone in a house with a com- 
plete set of one of our oldest and most respected 
magazines. It was in a little inn on the top of Mount 
Mansfield ; and for several days the fog hung over 
the mountain, so that I could not get about. Never 
mind, I thought, there is solace within! But as I 
turned over volume after volume of the magazine, 
and realized the mediocrity of the verses, the dul- 
ness of the essays, the tameness of the domesticated 
variety of the short-story, my soul grew dark within 
me, and I took my chances in the fog outside. 

The late Charles A. Dana is reported to have said 
that he edited the New York " Sun " for an audi- 
ence which was thirteen years old. Now my last 
indictment of our lateliterature is that it has been 
edited for women, who have been its main readers. 
Women, like the pretty realism which reproduces 
the everyday facts of their lives. With their practical 
instincts and craving for authority, they approve of 
didacticism, which seems to them plain good-sense. 
Although playful and witty, they have no great turn 
for humor, and coarseness disgusts them. They are in 
themselves the best exponents of Beauty, but they are 
by no manner of means the Beauty worshippers that 
men are. Their plastic sense is naturally weak, and 
hardly extends beyond an appreciation of pretty gew- 
gaws ; so that the form, color, picture, music of verse 
makes little appeal to them. What they demand in 
poetry is sentiment and emotion. Tragedy hurts 
them ; it was the women who fainted when the 
Eumenides of iEschylus rushed upon the stage. They 
do not see the good of the crimes, horrors, and vio- 
lence necessary in tragic work. Of course these are 
sweeping charges, and they are open to many excep- 
tions ; but in the large they are true. And certainly 
men do not want any general reformation in feminine 
nature in these respects. We are fairly content with 
women as they are. But if we are going to relegate 
altogether to them the reading of books, literature 
will of course follow the lines suited to their tastes 
and instincts. 

Mr. Aldrich's period of probation is nearly past. 
After its twenty years wandering in the desert, 
Poetry may at last be coming to the Promised Land. 
In prose there are signs of a leavening and lighten- 
ing of the vast soggy mass of realism, didacticism, 
and sentiment. Real creative imagination, real 
humor, real wit, begin to be apparent. But Poetry, 
with its balanced wings of sense and spirit, is the 
true angel that must move the waters. Until we 
believe in Poetry again, we shall not be saved. 

Charles Leonard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The public library's vast accumulation of 
trash — for such, in sober truth, much of our cur- 
rent literature will hereafter be adjudged to be — 
may well give us pause. At the recent dedication 
of the new building of the Pennsylvania Historical 
Society, Mr. Charles Francis Adams took occasion 
to utter a warning against the indiscriminate pres- 
ervation of printed matter. " I venture a confident 
opinion," he declared, "that the world of scholar- 
ship would be in no wise appreciably poorer if one- 
half, and that the larger half, of the printed matter 
now accumulated in our public libraries could to- 
morrow be obliterated — swept clean out of exist- 
ence." With a book production yearly increasing, 
it is no wonder that library buildings designed to 
serve the needs of a century to come prove inade- 
quate in a quarter of that time, or even in less. Yet 
who can anticipate the verdict of posterity on our 
present literary output, and so decide what ought to 
be kept and what discarded ? The now familiar 
expedient (urged by Dr. Eliot) of providing a 
storage room or building for at least the temporary 
deposit of all likely candidates for oblivion, thus 
relieving the groaning shelves of the book-stack, is 
worth considering, even though the storage of inac- 
tive books is far more expensive than their summary 
destruction. The responsibility of deciding, peri- 
odically, what portion of a library's possessions 
should be committed to the flames is obviously 
greater than most librarians would care to assume. 
But to cull out, now and then, a few authors to be 
sent to the morgue, there to await a more or less 
remote posterity's mandate for their decent burial, 
would be a less serious matter ; and at any moment 
a book thus provisionally offered as a prey to dumb 
forgetfulness could, on second thought, be restored 
to the warm precincts of the cheerful day and per- 
haps put once more into lively circulation. The 
whole problem, however, is so serious, so increas- 
ingly serious, that no off-hand solution of it is pos- 
sible. Happily, like so many other diseases, this 
bibliothecal congestion will tend to work out its own 
cure, and it will be some time yet before our library 
book-stacks actually scrape the sky.

Over-capitalization in literature — in the 
printed page — is a matter on which a few timely 
words may be said ; as also a few words on under- 
capitalization. Capitals are a precious asset in the 
printer's art, and not to be treated frivolously. The 
reaction against the excessive and unmethodical 
capitalization of two centuries ago has itself been 
followed by something of a reaction in favor of the 
initial capital letter; and most effective that upper- 
case bit of type often proves as a mark of emphasis. 
But familiarity breeds contempt, and the reader 
ceases to be impressed as soon as the sprinkling of 
capitals turns into a steady down-pour. There is one 
use of the capital letter that has often seemed to us 



310 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



an abuse, though it has excited no general comment. 
In quoting a German word, of the noun-class, why 
should we feel obliged to conform invariably to the 
German rule and distinguish the word with a capital ? 
It is well enough to write Kaiser and Konigreich 
and Vaterland with large initials if one chooses; 
but when it comes to beinkleider and bleistift and 
tintenfass, they deserve no such distinction at our 
hands, whatever the practice of the Teuton. Con- 
trariwise, merely because the French (and the 
library-school graduates) write their book-titles with 
only an initial capital, unless proper names occur, 
why should we discard the old and approved usage 
of capitals for all nouns and other important words 
in the title? Excessive economy — parsimony, in 
fact — in the use of upper-case letters has long 
marked the typography of a leading New England 
newspaper whose reputation is national. There is 
a story that when a new compositor on this paper 
asked what rule to follow in the use of capitals, he 
was instructed by a fellow-compositor to confine their 
use to the founder of Christianity and the founder 
of the paper. The journal in question indulges in 
such eccentricities as " Bunker hill," " Connecticut 
river," "New haven railroad company," " Standard 
oil trust," and " the social democrat party," and in a 
late issue made the surprising statement, " We have 
crossed the rubicon." A small river, in truth, is 
the Rubicon, but surely of sufficient importance in 
Roman history to deserve a large initial letter. In 
this matter, as in so many others, there is a reason- 
able middle way between the extremes of excess 
and abstinence which the trained taste should find 
it not hard to follow. 

" How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day" 
is the effective title of a little book by Mr. Arnold 
Bennett, written some years ago, but practically 
discovered in America in the wake of the recent 
popularity of " The Old Wives' Tale." Many of 
the characters in Mr. Bennett's novels are of the 
type that " muddle along " and call it living; and he 
understands with peculiar completeness the common- 
place person's attitude (or lack of attitude) toward 
life, — the sleepy, unthinking acquiescence in its 
conditions, dominated by a wish — not poignant 
enough to operate as a motive, but too strong to make 
real contentment possible — that he had " more 
time " for the things that count. " More time," says 
Mr. Bennett, is one of a very few things that 
nobody can get. You can neither buy, beg, nor lose 
your quota of time. No matter how shamefully you 
misuse one hour, another undeviatingly follows. The 
thing to do, then, is to cease wishing for the impos- 
sible, and to realize that if you work, let us say, eight 
hours, and sleep seven or eight, you still have eight 
or nine hours a day in which to live, with mind as 
well as body. In the little book above referred to, 
and in a similar collection of articles on " The 
Reasonable Life," Mr. Bennett makes trenchant 
suggestions on the vitalizing of dull, purposeless 
evenings, the utilizing of time spent in getting to 



and from work, the application to the quickening 
and development of the mind of the ideas that are 
rife nowadays about physical culture. He proposes 
no spectacular scheme of self-cultivation ; " slow and 
sure " is his motto. But most of his readers will be 
perplexed indeed to know what becomes of those 
extra eight or nine hours, and will be inclined to 
try some of Mr. Bennett's simple expedients for 
filling one or two of them. 

Mr. Galsworthy's dramatic theme has always 
been justice to the under dog. Recently he has used 
" Justice " as the title of a play which, in grim sim- 
plicity of motive and action and in utter absence of 
stage conventions and dramatic "effects," is even 
less theatrical, if possible, than his three plays that 
have preceded it. The brief is strong just because 
it makes no pretension to being unassailable. Its 
unfolding has been followed with the tensest interest 
at the Repertory Theatre in London, and it is said 
that Mr. Winston Churchill, after listening atten- 
tively through a performance, immediately instituted 
several reforms in prison management suggested by 
the experiences of the hero, Falder, who is " sent 
up " for three years for raising a cheque. He does 
raise the check, his motive being a desire to free a 
woman friend from the tyranny and abuse of a cruel 
husband. Whether he was at the moment crazed 
by love and worry, is the legal point at issue ; the 
vital one being whether the law is justified, — for the 
boy's life is ruined, and incidentally the woman's, 
before justice has run its course. A fussy old bar- 
rister's clerk with a heart furnishes the humor, with- 
out which this " slice of life " would be unbearably 
grim. The very restrained style of the play is hard 
on the reader — and on the actor too, at the same 
time that it furnishes him with his great opportunity. 

The power of the apt phrase can hardly be 
overestimated. The late Professor Sumner of Yale 
declared in his last book that " an educated man 
ought to be beyond the reach of suggestion from 
advertisements, newspapers, speeches, and stories." 
Nevertheless, a live man must and will react on his 
environment, and the seductions of clever adver- 
tisements, adroit headlines, persuasive speeches, 
and interesting stories must be resisted if they are 
not yielded to ; they cannot leave an intelligently 
alert person absolutely indifferent. Hence the pow- 
erful influence exerted by men who can put thoughts 
that breathe into words that burn. How many a 
man and woman has been moved to the expression, 
wise or unwise, of righteous indignation by that 
little phrase of Burke's " a limit at which forbearance 
ceases to be a virtue," or has been taught patience 
by that other phrase of his, " Custom reconciles us 
to everything "! "A wise and salutary neglect " has 
been the salvation of many young persons wholly 
ignorant of their debt to the coiner of the phrase. 
Franklin's assertion that "there never was a good 
war or a bad peace " has contributed, who knows 
how much, to international harmony, as his equally

famous saying that " in this world nothing is certain 
hut death and taxes " has helped many of us to hear 
philosophically the vicissitudes of our lot. That 
there is a one best way, or supremely effective way, 
to state an important truth, who that has picked up 
a few of the immortal phrases of literature and of 
proverbial philosophy can doubt? 

• • • 

The steady demand for the favorite old 
books reveals an element of strength and perma- 
nency that is in encouraging contrast with the 
insatiate craving for the latest popular novelty in 
literature. Recent investigation has proved that, 
with the Bible and Shakespeare heading the list of 
constant sellers. Scott (especially his "Ivanhoe"), 
Hawthorne ("The Scarlet Letter" first and fore- 
most), Thackeray ("Vanity Fair" particularly), 
and Dickens (both in " Pickwick " and " David 
Copperfield "), are in large and unflagging demand. 
Lew Wallace's •■ Ben Hur" still appeals strongly to 
book-buyers, and is said, perhaps with some exag- 
geration, to bring in about forty thousand dollars a 
year to the author's family. Strikingly inferior is 
the popularity of both his earlier novel ** The Fair 
God " and his later effort u The Prince of India." 
An encouraging symptom is the large public demand 
for the leading poets, Longfellow outdistancing all 
competitors in this country, with Whittier in second 
place. Tennyson and Browning also have each a 
strong following, and the sale of FitzGerald's 
" Omar," since the expiration of copyright twenty 
years ago, has been such as would have struck the 
modest translator (or adaptor, rather) dumb with 
amazement. 

The possibilities of the 'prentice pen are 
delightfully unrestricted. What new and epoch- 
making contribution the young writer shall make to 
literature, it rests with himself to determine. A 
striking proof of the young and unknown author's 
power to command attention, and to win sure reward 
for good work well done, was lately furnished in 
London, where a publisher, Mr. Andrew Melrose, 
had offered a handsome prize of two hundred and 
fifty guineas for the best novel submitted in open 
competition. One hundred and sixty manuscripts 
were offered, and were passed upon by three com- 
petent judges — Mrs. Flora Annie Steel, Miss Mary 
Cholmondeley, and Mrs. Henry de la Pasture ; and 
the winning novel, " A Marriage under the Terror," 
is found to be a " first performance " as a novel, the 
writer, " Patricia Wentworth." having produced 
hitherto only short stories. Sanguine expectations 
of a brilliant success for '• A Marriage under the 
Terror " are entertained. 

• • • 

The printer's art as a branch of liberal 
culture, or at least of business education, is now 
made a subject of university instruction at Harvard. 
A course in the history of printing is offered in the 
Fine Arts department, and a course on the technique 
of printing is given in the recently established Busi- 



ness School. The materials and processes — paper, 
ink, type, printing machinery, and so on — are to be 
studied under the tuition of experts. An advanced 
course, including visits to various printing-houses, 
and exercises in preparation of copy, proof-reading, 
catalogue-making, and other details of printing and 
publishing, is also in prospect. If the art of printing 
can thus be restored to something like its dignity 
and importance in the days of the Elzevirs and the 
Aldines, possibly we may be consoled for the loss 
sustained in the process by Virgil and Cicero, 
Homer and Sophocles and Plato. Certainly it is a 
far cry from the Greek, Latin, and mathematics of 
the old-time college to the multitudinous and more or 
less " practical " courses and schools of the modern 
university. 

Of interest to Stratford visitors this sum- 
mer will be the forthcoming " Catalogue of the Books, 
Manuscripts, Works of Art, Antiquities, and Relics, 
at present exhibited in Shakespeare's Birthplace," 
issued by the trustees of said birthplace for the use 
of that large fraction of the touring public which 
yearly pays its tribute of curiosity and cash to the fa- 
mous town on the Avon. The catalogue is described 
as containing sixty-one illustrations of objects on 
exhibition, among them being facsimiles of Shake- 
speare signatures and of title-pages to early editions 
of his works, with occasional literary and historical 
annotations. 



COMM UNICA TION. 



PROFESSOR AGASSIZ AND THE CARNEGIE FUND. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I find on page 264 of your issue of April 16 a state- 
ment in regard to my lifelong friend Dr. Alexander 
Agassiz, which in justice to him and to the Carnegie 
Scientific Institution of Washington needs to be cor- 
rected. The statement is, in substance, that Agassiz 
was offered 875,000 for conducting some deep-sea 
soundings on condition that the enterprise should be 
known as the Carnegie-Agassiz Expedition, and that he 
declined the offer and found the money elsewhere. 

Together with Dr. John Billings, I spent a night with 
Mr. Agassiz and arranged that we should offer him 
$50,000 from the Carnegie Fund to enable us to place 
several men of science on his exploring vessel, who 
would carry on researches somewhat different from 
those in which he expected to be engaged. There was 
no condition made as to the name of the expedition, 
which was always mentioned in the papers of the Car- 
negie Scientific Institution as the " Agassiz Expedition," 
and never had associated with its title even the name 
Carnegie. 

Some time before the expedition started, Mr. Agassiz 
made up his mind that he preferred to carry on the 
expedition without assistance ; and as it was so arranged, 
we of the Carnegie Institution took no part in his ven- 
ture. It is therefore not true that he was offered 
875,000, and that he promptly declined; and untrue 
that any condition as to a name for the enterprise was 
attached to the offer of assistance. Weir Mitchell.

The 



li Hoosier Schoolmaster " 
Revealed.* 



Probably nearly every reader of " The Hoosier 
Schoolmaster " — that pioneer in a school of fic- 
tion that has had a numerous following, though 
none of the zealous imitators has yet imperilled 
the supremacy of the original model — has been 
inclined to regard the Schoolmaster's experiences 
as the more or less faithful autobiography of the 
writer. It is therefore likely to surprise many 
readers of Mr. George Cary Eggleston's " Recol- 
lections of a Varied Life " to learn that not 
Edward, but his younger brother George, the 
author of these " Recollections," was the School- 
master so well depicted in the novel. Edward 
Eggleston's feebleness of health debarred him 
from active pursuits and constrained him to turn, 
not unwillingly, to his pen as a means of sup- 
port ; and it was his brother's pedagogic diffi- 
culties and triumphs at Riker's Ridge, in 
Indiana, that appealed to the novelist's fancy, 
and at a critical moment rescued from failure 
and bankruptcy that excellent old story-paper, 
" Hearth and Home." Sundry homely details 
characteristic of Hoosier life in the fifties, told 
with the convincing force of actual experience, 
are now added to the necessarily embroidered 
account of that life as given in the story. 

Mr. George Cary Eggleston calls himself, 
near the close of his volume, " an extempora- 
neous writer" — the sort of writer developed 
by the stress and strain of metropolitan jour- 
nalism; and his brisk narrative has all the 
excellences, and not many of the defects, of the 
trained journalist. The reader is spared all 
introductory or genealogical matter, and all that 
is of a family nature or of interest chiefly to 
the writer himself. Plunging into the midst 
of things, Mr. Eggleston tells us, rapidly and 
effectively, what sort of a life he has led since 
his birth at Vevay, Indiana, seventy years ago, 
and what kind of persons, celebrated or obscure, 
he has had intercourse with in his varied, and, 
for a man of letters, rather eventful, course. 
His family is of Virginia extraction, and in the 
Old Dominion he himself passed a few of his 
adolescent years and received the latter part of 
his academic training. His enthusiasm for 
things and persons Virginian, well known to 
readers of his romances, finds additional warm 
expression in these retrospections, wherein also

Eggleston. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



he not unnaturally deplores the passing of the 
old order, the displacement of the Southern 
planter by the Yankee farmer, and the invasion 
of the cotton-mill and all the unloveliness of 
factory life where once were to be enjoyed the 
courtliness and the leisure of the broad-acred 
Virginia plantation. 

So warmly did the young Eggleston espouse 
the cause of his adopted State that when the 
Civil War broke out there seems not to have 
been the slightest hesitation on his part which 
side of the quarrel to make his own. Enlisting 
early and serving to the end, the young caval- 
ryman evidently found his life in the field much 
to his taste ; at least he treats us to very little 
of the horrors of war, but to not a few agree- 
able pictures of the freedom and adventure he 
enjoyed during those four years of campaigning. 
Of his life in general in the South, and of the 
peculiar virtues of Southerners, he has much to 
say which, in its warmth of eulogy, taxes the 
reader's credulity. But he earnestly protests 
that he is not exaggerating, and it is certainly 
far pleasanter to believe than to doubt him. He 
must, however, have been placed in somewhat 
exceptional surroundings if one may judge from 
such passages as the following. 

" Both the young men and the young women read 
voluminously — the young men in part, perhaps, to equip 
themselves for conversational intercourse with the young 
women They hoth read polite literature, but they read 
history also with a diligence that equipped them with 
independent convictions of their own, with regard to 
such matters as the conduct of Charlotte Corday, the 
characters of Mirabeau, Danton, and Robespierre, the 
ungentlemanly treatment given by John Knox to Mary 
Queen of Scots, and all that sort of thing. Indeed, 
among the Virginia women, young and old, the romantic 
episodes of history, ancient, mediaeval, and modern, 
completely took the place, as subjects of conversation, 
of those gossipy personalities that make up the staple 
of conversation among women generally." 

Soon after the close of the war, young Mr. 
Eggleston removed to Illinois, and thence to 
Mississippi, where he began and ended his brief 
and unstimulating experience of the law as a 
profession. Forsaking this, "in the profoundest 
disgust," for journalism, and for literature in a 
wider sense, he betook himself, with wife and 
child, to New York and secured work as a reporter 
on the Brooklyn " Union," of which Theodore 
Tilton was then editor, having recently left 
"The Independent." The enterprise and what 
he himself calls the " cheek " of the would-be 
journalist are illustrated by his very first con- 
tribution to his newspaper. While waiting for 
his first assignment he wrote an article and sent 
it in to Mr. Tilton, who liked it and printed it

as a "leader." Throughout Mr. Eggleston's 
" varied life," he has manifestly had a happy 
faculty for landing always on his feet and for 
makinsr a success of whatever he has undertaken. 
He says of himself that he has always been 
" intensely in earnest," and that may help to 
explain his unfailing effectiveness in any activity 
claiming his attention. 

Among the many famous men, chiefly men of 
letters, with whom Mr. Eggleston has had deal- 
ings, professional or friendly, Bryant is one 
whom we are glad to be made better acquainted 
with from the personal anecdotes of the great 
editor's assistant on the "Evening Post." Con- 
troverting Lowell's commonly-accepted descrip- 
tion of him in " A Fable for Critics," where he 
appears as cold and unresponsive by nature, 
Mr. Eggleston says : 

" The lack of warmth usually attributed to Mr. 
Bryant I found to be nothing more than the personal 
reserve common to New Englanders of culture and 
refinement, plus an excessive personal modesty and a 
shyness of self-revelation and self-intrusion which is 
usually found only in young girls just budding into 
womanhood. Mr. Bryant shrank from self-assertion 
even of the most impersonal sort, as I never knew any 
other human being to do. He cherished his own opin- 
ions strongly, but he thrust them upon nobody. His 
dignity was precious to him, but his only way of assert- 
ing it was by withdrawal from any conversation or com- 
pany that trespassed upon it. Above all, emotion was 
a sacred thing, not to be exploited or even revealed. In 
ordinary intercourse with his fellow-men he hid it away 
as one instinctively hides the privacies of the toilet. He 
could no more lay his feelings bare to common scrutiny 
than he could have taken his bath in the presence of 
company. In the intimate talks he and I had together 
during the last half-dozen years of his life, he laid aside 
bis reserve, so far as it was possible for a man of his 
sensitive nature to do, and I found him not only warm 
in his human sympathies, but even passionate." 

Mr. Eggleston's long experience as literary 
editor gives weight to his opinion in matters 
of literary ethics. His judgment concerning 
anonymity in literary criticism is apparently 
reflected in what he quotes from Bryant under 
this head. " I regard an anonymous literary 
criticism," said the poet on one occasion to Mr. 
Eggleston, "as a thing quite as despicable, 
unmanly, and cowardly as an anonymous letter. 
It is something that no honorable man should 
write, and no honorably conducted newspaper 
should publish." It is true that most of the 
reviews in the "Post " were unsigned in Bryant's 
day (as now), but he maintained that in letting it 
be generally known who was the literary editor 
of that journal he had removed the stigma of 
anonymity from them. 

As Mr. Eggleston devotes most of his chap- 
ters to those early days of young hope and 



boundless possibilities with which he entered on 
his life-work, there is no lack of stimulus and 
freshness in his pages. In writing his first book, 
a manual entitled " How to Educate Yourself," 
for " Putnam's Handy Book Series," he says 
that he had the advantage of comparative youth 
and of that self-confident omniscience which 
only youth can have. " I knew everything 
then," he continues, " better than I know any- 
thing now, so much better, indeed, that for a 
score of years past I have not dared open the 
little book, lest it rebuke my present ignorance 
beyond my capacity to endure." The account 
of his early good-fortune in being solicited to 
write " A Rebel's Recollections " for " The 
Atlantic," and of the genesis of various other 
works from his pen, with the record of his busy 
life as a journalist in New York, is full of 
interest. The chapters are short, and the 
reader's attention is gladly given to their brisk 
recital of incident and anecdote. The writer's 
brief closing description of his working habits 
is likely to be of help to young followers of lit- 
erature or journalism. The " extemporaneous " 
element in the book, while freeing it from any 
evidence of labor, any smell of the lamp, betrays 
itself less admirably in an occasional mark of 
carelessness, as in the use of compte as the 
French form of count, and in the neither French 
nor English seigniors. There are no pictures 
in the volume, not even a frontispiece portrait 
of the author. Something of Bryant's " shyness 
of self -revelation and self -intrusion " has indeed 
been shown by Mr. Eggleston in this respect as 
in others ; and who shall say his book is not all 
the better for it ? Percy F. Bicknell. 



Some English Romantic Poets.* 



Current essays in literary criticism are numer- 
ous enough, but it is a rare volume which really 
takes its readers further along than they were 
before. It is therefore with pleasure that we 
take account of Mr. Arthur Symons's sub- 
stantial volume of criticism on certain British 
poets who in their time contributed to the 
modern development of natural feeling and the 
feeling for nature in English poetry. It is a 
book over which the discerning reader will 
felicitate himself as he reads, and the literary 
student — even though a critic — grow decor- 
ously enthusiastic as he writes. 

There are, of course, spots upon which criti-

Arthur Symons. New York : E. P. Dutton and Co.

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



cism may light. There is, first of all, a disap- 
pointment in store for those who take the volume 
in hand with expectations naturally aroused 
by the title. The book is not a treatise upon 
the Romantic Movement at all. In his preface 
the author explains that he does not use the term 
in its usual historical sense. There is, from his 
point of view, nothing in this development of 
English poetry so definite as a conscious " move- 
ment." In the Tractarian Movement, for exam- 
ple, there was a definite aim which set many 
minds working together. " No such thing ever 
happened in the creation of literature." These 
romanticists among the poets were comrades, to 
be sure, but not colleagues ; they should there- 
fore be studied as individuals. And so in the 
bulk of the volume we find a collection of criti- 
cal estimates in which some eighty or ninety 
versifiers are considered in chronological order, 
and in which a valuation is placed upon their 
work. A brief Introduction, of less than twenty 
pages, contains all that Mr. Symons cares to 
say about what we usually term the Romantic 
Movement ; and here he defines the phrase as 
meaning " simply the reawakening of the imag- 
ination, a reawakening to a sense of beauty and 
strangeness in natural things, and in all the im- 
pulses of the mind and senses. That reawaken- 
ing was not always a conscious one." 

Nor will the plan of selection adopted by the 
critic in his choice of poets for consideration com- 
mend itself to everyone. No method of limitation 
could be more arbitrary. The year 1800 is fixed 
upon as a centre for Mr. Symons's chronological 
compasses, and the sweep of his instrument in- 
cludes all the romantic poets who, born previous 
to that year, survived it. As fate arranged, there- 
fore, it is John Home (1722-1808) who heads 
the list of these romanticists, since he chanced to 
be the oldest British versifier who survived the 
century; and it is Thomas Hood (1799-1845) 
who closes the list, because, apparently, no other 
romantic poet claims the closing year of the 
century as that of his birth. 

However, it is for Mr. Symons to write of 
whom he pleases, and it is hardly worth while to 
quarrel with him for thus excluding from his 
pages the earlier leaders in the movement — 
Gray, Cowper, Thomson, and Burns. Of Burns, 
to be sure, the author does have a few suggestive 
words to say in his Introduction, but he gives no 
adequate study of the Scotch poet. 

Quibbling aside, there is abundance of inter- 
esting material in these pages. It is worth while, 
perhaps, just to have one's memory refreshed 
regarding the significance of those half -forgotten 



if not altogether unknown names. Who was 
John Home, for example ? Little of his work 
has survived his own day, yet two lines in his 
play of " Douglas " were familiar to us when we 
were schoolboys : 

" My name is Norval ; on the Grampion Hills 
My father feeds his flocks; a frugal swain." 

And here appears Dr. Erasmus Darwin (1731- 
1802), physician, natural philosopher, and didac- 
tic poet, the distinguished grandsire of the more 
distinguished Charles ; with his " Loves of the 
Plants " and his " Temple of Nature," in whom 
Imagination mated with Science, producing 
some strange results. Describing a statue of 
Lot's wife in the salt-mines of Cracow, he notes : 
" Cold dews condense upon her pearly breast, 
And the big tear rolls lucid down her vest." 

John Wolcott (1735-1803) follows, more 
easily recognized under the pen-name of " Peter 
Pindar " — with his 

" desultory way of writing, 
A hop and step and jump way of inditing." 

William Combe (1741-1823) is another writer 
whose name rests upon the memory with less 
weight than that of " Dr. Syntax," the pseu- 
donym under which he wrote. It now occurs 
to us that in our youth we curiously studied 
over two or three volumes of Dr. Syntax's 
" Tours," but it is a surprise to learn that this 
gentleman was the author of some eighty publi- 
cations, of which none has really survived. 

If the names already cited are unfamiliar, 
those of a little group of women contemporary 
with these men are still alive. Here are Mrs. 
Barbauld and Joanna Baillie; and Hannah 
More, of pious memory, whose sacred dramas, 
we are assured, are " still readable on a dull 
afternoon." It may well be that few now read 
the verses which these ladies wrote ; but this can 
hardly be said of Carolina, Lady Nairne (1766- 
1845), whose lilting songs — "The Laird of 
Cockpen," " Caller Herrin'," and "The Land o' 
the Leal" — make their appeal to-day as freshly 
as when first written. It was Lady Nairne, by 
the way, whose " admiration of Burns showed 
itself in the desire to publish a ' purified ' edition 
of his songs"; but whose practical good sense 
led her to see that some of the ploughman's best 
poems "wouldn't be purified," and finally to 
abandon the scheme. There is an interesting 
note upon the two sisters, Ann and Jane Taylor, 
joint authors of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little 
Star," which contains the following comment. 
It will strike an American ear oddly enough. 

" The talents of Jane were more considerable than 
those of Ann. She is something what Longfellow 
would like to have been ; but her art is far above his."

THE DIAJL

There is not much space for personal history 
in these severely condensed paragraphs of critical 
comment, but Mr. Symons has found room here 
and there for a few details. The reader is often 
touched by their pathos. There was Robert 
Bloomfield, a country boy, and afterward a tailor 
in a London garret. There he wrote rural tales, 
ballads, and nature poems ; thirty thousand 
copies of " The Farmer's Boy " were sold in 
three years ; he was lionized and patronized, and 
then left to die in poverty. " Had he lived 
longer he would probably have gone mad." 
Robert Tannahill worked at a loom in Paisley 
all his life, making his songs as he worked, like 
Hans Sachs on his cobbler's bench. He went 
"melancholy-mad," burned his manuscripts, and 
drowned himself in the river. George Beattie, 
the crofter's son, who wrote much about " grisly 
ghaists " and u whinnering goblins," shot himself 
because of disappointment in love. On the 
other hand, there was the experience of William 
Nicholson, son of a Galloway carrier, who be- 
came a peddler, printed his own poems and took 
them about in his pack. M He went to fairs 
as singer and piper; then took to drink, and a 
new gospel which he wanted to preach to the 
King ; but. coming back unsatisfied, became a 
drover." Most romantic of all, perhaps, was the 
career of James Hogg, M the Ettrick Shepherd," 
who began at seven by herding cows on the hills 
of Selkirk. At twenty he could not write the 
alphabet : but at twenty-six he began to make 
up verses in his head. Having heard " Tarn 
O'Shanter " recited by a half -daft person, he 
resolved to be a poet and to fill Burns 's place 
in the world. And he did become a poet — a 
poet of such pretensions that Mr. Symons de- 
votes ten pages of comment to his work. 

The general reader of this book will turn with 
natural interest to those sections which deal with 
the greater poets — Wordsworth, Scott, Cole- 
ridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats. And here Mr. 
Symons's critical strength is most forcibly recog- 
nized. His discussion of Wordsworth's poetical 
quality is one of the best that has been written. 

" Sincerity was at the root of all Wordsworth's merits 
and defects ; it gave him his unapproachable fidelity to 
nature; and also his intolerable fidelity to his own 
whims. Like Emerson, whom he so often resembled, 
he respected all intuitions ; but, unlike Emerson, did not 
always distinguish between a whim and an intuition." 

Such is the critic's point of view as indicated at 
the beginning of the section. In his criticism 
of individual poems, therefore, he consistently 
deprecates the w Laodamia " as "an attempt to 
be classic." 



" Here Wordsworth would be Greek as the Greeks 
were, or rather as they seem to us, at our distance from 
them, to be; and it is only in single lines that he suc- 
ceeds, all the rest of the poem showing an effort to be 
something not himself. Thus this profoundly natural 
poet becomes for once, as Matthew Arnold has noted, 
' artificial ' in a poem which has been classed among his 
masterpieces." 

It is interesting to find that Mr. Symons him- 
self considers "The Leech-Gatherer" (or "Reso- 
lution and Independence ") to be Wordsworth's 
" greatest, as it is certainly his most charac- 
teristic," poem. This assertion, while perhaps 
unconventional, is altogether consistent, and 
to many a lover of that realistic, homely, yet 
eloquent parable, it is exceedingly gratifying. 
Ideally characteristic of the poet this composi- 
tion surely is; among the compositions typical 
of Wordsworth, which other is more admirable 
than this? 

Of Scott, the critic says : " The novelist died 
. . . in 1825 ; but the poet committed suicide, 
with Harold the Dauntless, in 1817." For Sir 
Walter's poetry he has no admiration and scant 
patience. 

" Scott's verse [his long poems] is written for boys, 
and boys, generation after generation, will love it with 
the same freshness of response . . . Byron usually fol- 
lows Scott in the boy's head, and drives out Scott, as that 
infinitely greater, though imperfect, force may well do. 
Shelley often completes the disillusion. But it is well, 
perhaps, that there should be a poet for boys, and for 
those grown-up people who are most like boys ; for 
those, that is, to whom poetry appeals by something in 
it which is not the poetry.'' 

Byron, he declares " has power without wisdom, 
power which is sanity, and human at heart, but 
without that vision which is wisdom." Byron's 
ennui "was made up of many elements, but it 
was partly of that most incurable kind which 
comes from emptiness rather than over-fulness ; 
the ennui of one to whom thought was not sat- 
isfying, without sustenance in itself, but itself a 
cause of restlessness, like a heady wine drunk in 
solitude." In writing of Shelley, Mr. Symons 
says: 

" There are two kinds of imagination, that which 
embodies and that which disembodies. Shelley's is that 
which disembodies, filling mortal things with unearthly 
essences or veiling them with unearthly raiment. Words- 
worth's imagination embodies, concentrating spirit into 
man, and nature into a wild flower." 

Keats is described as the artist "to whom art 
is more than life, and who, if he realises that 
4 Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty,' loves truth 
for being beautiful and not beauty for its inner- 
most soul of spiritual truth." 

These passages are fairly illustrative of our 
author's critical attitude. His comments are 



316 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



incisive, sound, and stimulating. Originality of 
view and definiteness of judgment are stamped 
on every dictum. It is not necessary to add that 
Mr. Symons writes with the pen of a literary 
artist, but it is proper to say that half the 
pleasure derived from the book is due to this 
fact. Felicitous phrases and terse epigrams 
brighten the paragraphs and illuminate the 
criticism. 

" Thus, Setebos, storming because Mephistopheles 
Gave him the lie, 
Said he 'd ' blacken his eye,' 
And dashed in his face a whole cup of hot coffee-lees." 

This illustrates what Mr. Symons terms the 
" cascading of cadences " in " The Ingoldsby 
Legends." In describing the songs of Tanna- 
hill, he speaks of " that almost inarticulate 
jingle and twinkle which goes with the genuine 
gallop of the Scottish tongue." " Pope," he 
says, " is the most finished artist in prose who 
ever wrote in verse." Again : " Where other 
poets use reality as a spring-board into space, 
Blake uses it as a foothold on his return from 
flight." 

This is indeed a book which reflects the posi- 
tive personality of a brilliant mind. It is not 
without eccentricities of opinion, nor are its 
judgments infallible ; but it is a volume thor- 
oughly worth while. It really takes its reader 
further on. W> E> Simonds. 



A Classic of Biological, Literature. * 



In 1900 appeared the introductory part of the 
first volume of the original German edition of 
Hugo De Vries's mutationstheorie. This work 
has recently been translated into English with 
the title, " The Mutation Theory : Experiments 
and Observations on the Origin of Species in 
the Vegetable Kingdom." Volume I., " The 
Origin of Species by Mutation," has already 
been issued. If not epoch-making, this work in 
the original edition was at least epoch-marking. 
In conjunction with the then recently rediscov- 
ered work of the Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel, 
regarding the method by which characters are 
inherited, the ideas of De Vries served to stimu- 
late investigators all over the world to undertake 
experimental studies of the basic problems of 
organic evolution. No period of anything like 
equal length in the history of biology has

tions on the Origin of Species in the Vegetable Kingdom.

approached the last decade in respect to the 
quantity of reliable experimental data collected 
regarding the factors of evolution and their 
operation. The Darwinian and neo-Darwinian 
schools of evolutionary thought, in the very na- 
ture of the case, did not stimulate experimental 
lines of investigation. Their teaching was that 
the progressive changes of organic structure and 
function which we call evolution are things which 
proceed by the slow and gradual accumulation 
of exceedingly minute variations by a process of 
natural selection. But if it takes centuries to 
make any definite progress in evolution, what 
chance might a graduate student yearning for a 
doctorate, or a university instructor struggling 
for an increase in salary and rank, be supposed 
to have of getting anywhere in an experimental 
study of evolution? Vita brevis est; and one 
was much surer of "results" by embarking upon 
a speculative discussion of the relation of exist- 
ing animals and plants to hypothetical primitive 
forms, assumed to have been acted upon by a 
hypothetical environment, or some similar sub- 
ject. 

To De Vries, perhaps more than to any other 
man, is due the credit of having brought about 
an entire change of the prevailing viewpoint in 
regard to the study of evolution. He saw clearly 
that the only way to get the investigation of 
evolution out of the slough of metaphysical 
despond in which it had so long floundered was 
precisely by the application of the experimental 
method to its problems. Through a long period 
of years he carried on a most brilliant and thor- 
ough experimental investigation aimed at the 
determination of how new varieties and species 
are as a matter of fact actually produced. The 
results of this investigation are embodied in the 
book under review. It is a substantial and 
enduring work of reference, rather than a popu- 
lar treatise. Its place in the library is beside 
Darwin's "Origin" and " Variation of Animals 
and Plants under Domestication." 

The first volume of " The Mutation Theory" 
is divided into two parts. The first part is occu- 
pied with a critical review of current theories of 
evolution, particularly those relating to the 
effect of selection. This is followed by a pre- 
sentation of the author's theory of the origin of 
species by mutation. Part II. contains the 
detailed account of De Vries's experiments and 
observations regarding the production of new 
elementary species in the evening primrose 
{Oenothera). The general result of this work is 
to demonstrate that new species have arisen in 
this genius suddenly by the appearance of a new

form which thereafter breeds true, and does not 
revert to the parent form. This process is called 
mutation, by the author. It is contended that 
evolution in general has proceeded by such dis- 
continuous steps, rather than by the gradual 
accumulation of minute variations. De Vries 
makes no denial of the importance of natural 
selection, but believes that its chief function is 
not to create, but rather to determine which 
mutations shall survive in the struggle for exis- 
tence. The limitations of the Mutation Theory 
as a general theory of Evolution must be settled 
by future investigation ; but there can be no 
doubt that this masterly work of De Vries's will 
long rank as a classic of biological literature.

Ax American Soldier axd Mystic* 



A remarkable character is revealed in the 
Diary of General Ethan Allen Hitchcock, 
extracts from which have been edited by the 
veteran author and journalist W. A. Croffut, 
and published under the title " Fifty Years in 
Camp and Field." The Diary covers almost 
the whole of the active life of General Hitch- 
cock. It was begun soon after his graduation 
from West Point in 1817, and the last entry 
was made more than fifty years later. It gives 
information upon Hitchcock's life while in- 
structor and commandant at West Point, where 
he trained many of the prominent Civil War 
generals ; upon his services on the Western 
frontier, in the Seminole Wars in Florida, and 
in the Mexican and Civil Wars. The work is 
not only a source of information about Hitch- 
cock himself, but a side-light thrown upon the 
public matters and policies of the time. The 
editor tells us that the hundreds of volumes 
of the Diary are filled mainly with Hitchcock's 
notes on his reading and with his own philo- 
sophical reflections, while only slight space is 
given to the details of his army life. However, 
somewhat more is said in the Diary about public 
questions of the day. In selecting material for 
publication the editor has omitted all except the 
most striking of the philosophical reflections, 
and has printed the more interesting personal 
notes and the comments on public matters and 
men. 

The Diary discloses an interesting character — 
a soldier well read in all the branches of litera-

ture, philosophy, and science ; a scholar who was 
an accomplished military organizer and execu- 
tive ; a philosopher of inquisitive mind, who, 
while he sat in courts-martial, inspected armies, 
or commanded districts, " took more pleasure in 
the infinite than in the finite, in metaphysics 
than in physics, in the occult than in the obvious." 
But it was chiefly as a soldier that the world 
knew General Hitchcock. He tells us that he 
went into the military profession, not because 
he was attracted to it, but because his people 
thought it to be the proper vocation for the 
grandson of the hero of Ticonderoga. Yet he 
was one of the most accomplished of American 
soldiers, as the positions held by him indicate. 
And probably no other good soldier was ever 
quite so independent in speech and with pen, so 
nearly insubordinate at times. The entries in 
the Diary show that he was a frequent " protest- 
ant " against the rulings or policies of command- 
ing officers, of the War Department, and of the 
President. And his protests were usually effec- 
tive. At times he must have been very trouble- 
some. The Diary mentions a dozen instances 
of issues between Hitchcock and some superior 
authority. He was sent by the West Point 
authorities to protest against President Andrew 
Jackson's interference with the discipline of 
cadets, and he roundly scolded u Old Hickory." 
He openly said that the Seminole Indians were 
cruelly treated, defrauded, and lied to by the 
government officials, and insisted that only a 
policy of conciliation would succeed in pacifying 
Florida, that he " never did believe in Harney's 
method of dealing with Indians — to hang them 
wherever they were found — but in friendly over- 
tures." In Florida he was finally given leave 
to try his plan ; and it succeeded. In the West 
he made much trouble for the politicians, but 
saved the Winnebagoes and the Cherokees from 
being defrauded and despoiled. 

General Hitchcock read aright the signs of 
American expansion in the Southwest. As 
early as 1836 he predicted the annexation of 
Texas, the war with Mexico, and a later disso- 
lution of the Union. He condemned both the 
Texan War and the Mexican War as being 
caused by American greed for land. Stationed, 
in 1836, on the Texan frontier, he came to the 
conclusion that the Texan War for indepen- 
dence was only a land-grabbing movement 
inspired from Washington. His Diary relates 
the story of the solitary individual who was 
making his way with long strides across Ken- 
tucky, with long rifle on shoulder and bullets 
in his belt. Someone asked him, " Where are

you going?" "To Texas." "What for?" 
" To fight for my rights." In Hitchcock's 
opinion, most " rights " on the Texan frontier 
were of this kind. In his note-books he 
recorded : 

" I am puzzled what to do. I regard the whole of 
the proceedings in the Southwest as being wicked as 
far as the United States are concerned. Our people 
have provoked the war [1836] with Mexico, and are 
prosecuting it not for ' liberty ' but for land. And I 
feel averse to being an instrument for these purposes. 

" Our people ought to be damned for their impudent 
arrogance and domineering presumption ! It is enough 
to make atheists of us all to see such wickedness in the 
world, whether punished or unpunished. 

" We have certain intelligence that J. K. Polk is 
elected President over Henry Clay. ... I look upon 
this as a step toward annexation of Texas first, and 
then, in due time, the separation of the Union." 

He criticized the government for the policy 
leading up to the Mexican War, for claiming 
the Rio Grande as the boundary, and for its 
treatment of Scott and Taylor ; but when the 
war actually began he took a prominent part in 
it, and became so interested that he quit read- 
ing and writing philosophy — the first time and 
the last time that such a thing happened in his 
life. 

As an historical document, the Diary is of 
most value for the light it will give the future 
historians of the Mexican War. It is a genuine 
inside view. The comments and information 
about Taylor, Scott, and other generals, about 
the battles and the campaigns of the war, the 
conditions in Mexico and the politics in the 
army, will be worth much to the investigator in 
this unpromising field. It is here, too, that the 
Diary is fullest. For the Civil War period it 
is less valuable. There are some good things 
about the political methods of the War Depart- 
ment, and some sharp criticism of the confused 
military policies that were evolved at Washing- 
ton by civilians. Of Secretary Stanton, Hitch- 
cock recorded this opinion : 

" He has no general principles of action. He decides 
a point one way one day, and a week later, forgetting 
his decision and having no definite principles to go by, 
he decides the same point another way. He authorizes 
a particular proceeding, and, within a week perhaps, 
the circumstances being exactly the same, he flies into 
a passion with someone for having followed his first 
decision." 

Here and there throughout the book we gain 
glimpses of Hitchcock's peculiar personality. 
He mentions "my abomination — a card-table"; 
when others were drinking, he retired to his 
room "and thought about infinity"; at Fort 
Jesup, when the officers had the choice of 
attending a horse-race or going to a gander- 
pulling, Hitchcock "took up the Meditations 



Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, that heathen of 
Spinoza." He did not swear, he read much, 
he was quiet ; he liked music extravagantly, and 
played on the flute. It is easy to see that with 
the generally uncultured officers of the twenties 
and thirties he could not be a favorite. Under 
date of February 16, 1835, he gives this glimpse 
of life at an army outpost. 

" I am in a peculiar situation here. I do not wish 
to depreciate the merits of my brother officers, but it 
is certain that their habits if not their tastes are differ- 
ent from mine, and, while a majority of them congre- 
gate and either play cards or smoke or drink or all 
three together, I am left in solitude or compelled to 
choose between those resorts and the company of the 
few ladies there are at the Prairie. ... I am certainly 
out of place here. My life is calculated to make me 
an object of envy and hate to most of those around 
men. In the first place, I do not join in any of the 
vices of the garrison — not one. I neither drink, play 
cards, nor even indulge in the smallest license of lan- 
guage. Next, I am disposed to literature, and some- 
times indicate that I read or think; and it is mostly in 
a field unexplored by others. I visit the ladies, and am 
almost the only officer who does visit the ladies ; and 
this is calculated to move to jealousy." 

But as the quality of the army officers improved, 
Hitchcock became more reconciled, and even 
found a few congenial spirits who preferred 
Plato and Spinoza to gambling and drinking. 

Like his grandfather, Hitchcock was an inde- 
pendent thinker about matters of religion. Soon 
after finishing his West Point course, he began 
his philosophical studies. He explained in his 
Diary that, having begun to doubt the stories of 
Jonah and Balaam's Ass, he endeavored to find 
out " what a certain class of men called philo- 
sophers thought of God and man and life." 
Thenceforward philosophy was his religion, — 
" a faith freed," he said, " from the gross super- 
stitions which give so many religions of the 
world a forbidding aspect." He kept standing 
orders for works on philosophy with booksellers 
in the United States and London, and he read 
all that could be had on the subject. Wherever 
he went he carried his books, until he reached 
California, when he sold them to the City of San 
Francisco to form the beginning of the present 
Mercantile Library. A typical entry in his Diary 
says : " My box of books has come — near $2 00 
worth, including Behman, Cudworth, Napier, 
Niebuhr's Rome, Scaliger, Bentham, Strauss, 
and the Bhagavat Gita." In his old age he 
became interested in the works of the alchemists 
and in the hermetic philosophy which would 
find hidden meanings in mediaeval writings. 
During the Civil War he published several 
books on the hermetic philosophy. Of all the 
philosophers, he was most impressed by Spinoza,

" that God-intoxicated man." Hitchcock him- 
self was Spinoza-intoxicated. He had editions 
of Spinoza's Ethics in French, German, and 
Latin, in addition to five manuscript copies in 
English, three of which he had made himself. 
Yet he " still felt a want," and made another 
translation. "I find myself more in harmony 
with Spinoza," he wrote, " than with any other 
man, dead or alive." And Philosophy was to 
him " the first and foremost blessing in the 
world." Walter L. Fleming. 



Chicago Before the Fire.* 



Chicagoans who have memories long enough 
to be worth mentioning relate most of their 
recollections to the year of the Great Fire. 
The year 1871 is our A. IT. C; local history 
since that date has an orderly and documented 
development, while the happenings of earlier 
days have a legendary tinge and seem so im- 
mensely remote that we almost wonder if they 
ever could have been true. The city that we 
know is a palimpsest, and the older record has 
become so completely obliterated that its recon- 
struction, even in imperfect form, involves toil- 
some effort and difficult mental readjustment. 
Yet the span is a brief one, as history reckons ; 
and even The Dial, with its thirty-year period 
this day rounded out, covers it by more than 
three-fourths. Holding to the past by this and 
other bonds, we have to go back only a few years 
further to penetrate the mists of the years which 
antedate the Fire, and enter into the spirit of 
the city's adolescent period. The retrospective 
venture is now prompted by Mr. Frederick 
Francis Cook's " Bygone Days in Chicago," a 
book of compelling interest to those of us who 
believe that we are citizens of no mean city, and 
who receive these greetings from the past, rich in 
their power to evoke long-slumbering memories, 
with feelings that are quite beyond adequate 
description. 

Mr. Cook, now for many years a resident of 
another city, came to Chicago in 1862, and was 
an old-time newspaper reporter in the service of 
our four leading dailies — "The Tribune," 
" The Times," « The Journal," and " The Post." 
He was a well-equipped journalist, who was 
brought close to the heart of many important 
matters and interests, and has preserved an 
extraordinarily vivid memory of his experiences. 

*Bygoxe Days m Chicago. Recollections of the 
" Garden City of the Sixties." By Frederick Francis Cook. 
Illustrated. Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co. 



He tells his story in a simple and straightfor- 
ward manner, and supplements it by something 
like a hundred reproductions of rare prints and 
photographs, mostly found in the collections of 
the Chicago Historical Society. His aim, stated 
in his own words, has been 

" To shed what light may be his on the psychology 
of a staid yet surcharged period, now difficult for those 
who were not of it to realize ; rebuild for the mind's eye 
a vanished city; restore to its streets their varied life; 
rehabilitate past types in their proper setting; recall 
with a due regard for values some of the moving events 
of a memorable epoch ; and so provide a faithful tran- 
script for whomsoever may be interested in the * Garden 
City ' of a classic past, or a somewhat unique social 
integral, or feel moved to re-people it in fancy with the 
offspring of his imagination." 

The spirit which has animated him in this en- 
deavor is thus finely expressed : 

" Chicago is to the unthinking a synonyme for Ma- 
terialism. Yet, of a truth, she is a very Mother of 
Idealism. Unfortunately, she cannot yet hold all she 
nurtures, nor always realize the visions she inspires. 
For the present, therefore, she must needs content her- 
self with the role of prolific matrix, whose issue on 
occasion answers the beckoning of older centres, in the 
hope of a fuller expression — not, however, always 
realized." 

Both in the letter of historical fact, and in the 
spirit above set forth, Mr. Cook has accom- 
plished his task with admirable success, and 
deserved the gratitude of the younger genera- 
tion for which he has chiefly written. 

It is in its constant forcing of comparisons 
between past and present that this book achieves 
its most striking effects. These comparisons 
are usually implied rather than expressed, but 
they are soon present in the consciousness as we 
read. What a suggestion there is in the very 
name " Garden City "! For there was a time 
when Chicago had more gardens than slums — 
when Prairie Avenue really led straight to the 
prairies, and when Cottage Grove (now how 
fallen from its beautiful primitive estate!) was 
in very truth an oak grove in which cottages 
nestled, cottages that sheltered simple house- 
holds that are hardly imaginable in the " flats " 
that are now crowded and piled in those erst- 
while liberal spaces. In those days, Kankakee 
Avenue was the road to Kankakee, and not to 
the South Park ; Blue Island Avenue was the 
road to Blue Island, and not to the Slavonic 
quarter of our modern hive ; and residents of the 
North Side could start from their very doors to 
journey upon the Green Bay Road. In those 
days, Clark Street really recalled to those who 
used it the heroic deeds of George Rogers Clark, 
and Wells Street the little garrison that marched 
from Fort Dearborn to its tragic fate among

the dunes along the lake shore, and Clinton 
Street the creator of the Erie Canal that had 
made early Chicago possible and was to make 
Illinois one of the stanchest of the common- 
wealths that defended the Union in the great 
struggle against slavery. The descendants of the 
men who then walked those streets now think 
little of the names and their significance ; is it 
not something of a question whether the old 
thoughts have been replaced by new ones as 
worthy? 

" Probably no event in Chicago's history up 
to the time of the Fire was so much talked 
about all over the West, and so variously com- 
mented upon." The average older Chicagoan 
would have to guess many times before hitting 
upon the occurrence thus referred to ; and for 
the Chicagoan under sixty, guessing would be 
useless. The reference is to the cleaning out of 
the " North Side Sands " under the orders of 
" Long John " Went worth, then mayor of 
Chicago. 

" The scene of the episode was an isolated sand bar- 
ren, on the bleak North Shore, with Michigan Street for 
its centre. It was the fashion in the rough-and-ready 
volunteer fire department days for the ' authorities ' to 
give the men that < ran wid de masheen ' and worked 
the brakes, on one pretext or another, a « time,' — by 
making them instruments of ' moral regeneration.' . . . 
Here was an assemblage of rookeries, none above two 
stories in height, and very easily demolished. The brute 
in the average man was far greater in those days than 
now. There were no doubt many estimable citizens con- 
nected with some of the fire companies, for they were of 
many degrees, including one or two regarded as quite 
' tony.' But others were mere • fighting ' organizations, 
with small reference to fires ; and sometimes one would 
get so demoralized as to call for disbandment. Thus it 
was men in many instances in no wise above the level 
of their victims, who in a riotous enthusiasm drove these 
bedraggled outcasts from their shelter, and forced them 
to seek refuge where none was obtainable. Yet this 
exhibition of barbarism in the name of high morality 
set • Long John ' apart in the estimation of ' good and 
pious people,' as the defender of the home and an 
apostle of purity ; while to the • men about town ' it 
furnished a theme to dramatize." 

The result of this raid was to drive vice into 
South Side quarters, where it became a greater 
menace to decency than it had been before. But 
some lessons are never learned, and the zeal of 
our present-day " reformers " is misdirected in 
much the same way. 

A large section of this book is devoted to 
war-time memories, and deals with such inter- 
esting matters as the raising of troops, the 
history of Camp Douglas, the closing of the 
" Times " office by order of General Burnside, 
the partisan alignment of the foreign popula- 
tion, and the strife between copperheads and 



loyalists. The following passage illustrates the 
sectional sympathies of the city during the 
course of the conflict. 

" With the exception of a considerable Southern-born 
admixture, the native population was in the main loyal 
to the Union side, while the foreign-born population 
was divided into opposite camps, with an appreciable 
preponderance of numbers on the Irish side. Whereas 
the North Division with its dominant German popula- 
tion, and the Milwaukee Avenue region with its Scandi- 
navian beginnings, were ever enthusiastic for the Union 
and the abolition of slavery, all that region which lies 
between Archer and Blue Island Avenues (excepting a 
German cluster about Twelfth and Halsted Streets) 
was never more than lukewarm, and on occasion dis- 
tinctly hostile to the prosecution of the war. Whenever 
there was a notable Union victory, the North Side would 
burst spontaneously into a furor of enthusiasm, while 
matters down in the densely populated southwest region 
would be reduced to a mere simmer. But no sooner 
was there a Rebel victory than it was the turn of Bridge- 
port and its appanages to celebrate; and these demon- 
strations generally took the form of himting down any 
poor colored brother who might have strayed inadvert- 
ently within those delectable precincts." 

" Old Abe," the famous war eagle of the Eighth 
Wisconsin regiment, was on exhibition in Chi- 
cago at the first Sanitary Fair. The eagle 
" made it plain that he had but a poor opinion of his 
surroundings — that he missed the bugle call and the 
roar of battle. Then it happened one day that a noted 
war orator in attendance was called on for a speech. 
No sooner had he got well started than < Old Abe ' rose 
on his perch, flapped his wings, and evidently mistaking 
what he heard for the familiar, terror-inspiring ' Rebel 
yell ', screeched a wild defiance. This is probably the 
only instance when an orator in very fact made the 
American eagle scream." 

The Copperheads come in for much comment, 
illustrative quotation, and personal portraiture. 
One of them is thus characterized : 

" I am firmly persuaded that immovable Jacksonian 
Democrat (and a very Old Hickory, too, in appearance), 
dear old Dr. N. S. Davis, opposed the war on grounds 
of constitutional construction and none other: for, being 
a York State man, he had no controlling Southern 
family affiliations. The good doctor lived long enough 
to be well remembered by a later generation, and few 
in Chicago have died in greater honor. But in his virile 
manhood he was a chronic storm centre ; and it was only 
because he was so much besides a Copperhead that his 
so frequently ill-timed ' constitutional ' f ulminations met 
with toleration." 

A few brief quotations will show to what lengths 
the Copperhead orator was willing to go in those 
days of high feeling. 

" Abraham Lincoln has deluged the country with 
blood, created a debt of four thousand million dollars, 
and sacrificed two millions of human lives. At the 
November election we will damn him with eternal 
infamy." 

" We want to try Lincoln as Charles I. of England 
was tried, and if fonnd guilty will carry out the law." 

" If I am called upon to elect between the freedom

THE DIAL

of the nigger and disunion and separation, I shall choose 
the latter. You might search hell over and find none 
worse than Abraham Lincoln." 

" We have patiently waited for a change, but for four 
years have lived under a despotism, and the wonder is 
that men carry out the orders of the gorilla tyrant who 
has usurped the presidential chair." 

" Still the monster usurper wants more victims for 
his slaughter pens. I blush that such a felon should 
occupy the highest gift of the people. Perjury and 
larceny are written all over him." 

These pleasant observations, made in a spirit 
of such delicate amenity, make the campaign of 
1864 seem a lively affair. We may think we 
get excited in a modern presidential year, but 
we do not work ourselves up to that pitch of 
frenzy. Mr. Cook quotes Taine's saying, " Let 
me once frame the true psychology of a Jacobin, 
and my book is written." His own effort is to 
frame the psychology of the Copperhead, and 
his conclusion is " that among the Democratic 
masses of the north, antipathy to the negro out- 
weighed every other consideration." 

Mr. Cook's portrait gallery of old Chicagoans 
is so crowded with canvasses that we pass from 
one to another of them in a state bordering 
upon bewilderment, so many are the memories 
evoked and so strong the temptation to linger 
for a closer inspection. What he says about 
the redoubtable Wilbur F. Storey is unusually 
interesting, because he holds a brief for his old- 
time employer, whom he thinks to have been 
unjustly maligned in many ways. 

" There was unquestionably a vein of vindictiveness 
in Mr. Storey's make-up — as there was in most strong 
characters in those days — but it was never shown ex- 
cept against his equals. He was at bottom a just man, 
far from over-exacting in his demands for service ; 
while every failure had its day in court, and was judged 
on its merits. He was an incarnation of frankness 
himself, and demanded this quahty in his subordinates. 
Mr. Storey's faults were hugely the defects of his 
qualities. He was through and through a newspaper 
man. Xews for him, however, included the shady side 
of lif e ; and in exploiting this he gave perhaps too much 
scope for individual license. I am certain that he never 
gave an order that a scandal should be salacious or 
made attractive to the prurient. ... I permit myself 
to say that for more than a half-score of years most of 
the local • copy ' passed through my hands . . . and 
that during all that time not one line of • imaginary ' or 
1 fake ' matter of any sort or description was either 
published or so much as submitted for publication." 

Storey's Copperhead proclivities were of course 
against him, and were probably the underlying 
cause of the animus that long directed the attack 
upon his private life and character. 

The chapter entitled " An Early Sociable " 
shall provide our last glimpse of Mr. Cook's 
somewhat haphazard chronicle, and at the same 
time cast a pleasant light upon the chronicler. 



One evening, in the summer of 1866, he had 
just turned in his " copy " — an account of the 
raiding of a vile resort — and was about to de- 
part from the office, when the city editor asked 
him if he could "spare the time to run down to 
Mayor Rice's house." It seems that the eldest 
Miss Rice was giving a party, and Storey had 
made up his mind to take what was then a new 
departure in Chicago journalism, and exploit 
social functions in the columns of the " Times." 
The young reporter was aghast, for such an as- 
signment was an absolute novelty, and he could 
hardly take the request seriously. Asking what 
sort of story was desired, he was told : " Oh, 
mention the decorations if there are any, de- 
scribe some of the most picturesque toilettes, but 
above all get a list of those present." At last 
convinced that it was not all a joke, the dis- 
mayed reporter started out, walked to the Rice 
residence, and rang the bell. Miss Rice herself 
came to the door, and asked his errand. He 
timorously expressed a wish to report the party, 
but the suggestion was received with constern- 
ation, and the young woman pleaded so elo- 
quently against this invasion of her privacy 
that he promptly capitulated, and turned away 
without any attempt to gather the desired in- 
formation. The only story he turned in that 
night was one about a mysterious baritone who 
chanced to pass the house, singing " Marching 
Through Georgia," just as the reporter had 
taken his leave. His fear of the wrath to come 
was not realized, and he was never made to suf- 
fer for his lack of " enterprise." But he tells 
us that a few months later he would not have 
escaped so easily, for Storey's edict to have 
" things of that sort written up for all they were 
worth " had then gone into force, and the other 
papers were prompt to follow the lead of the 
" Times." Thus " society reporting " came into 
existence as a function of journalism in Chicago.

triple standpoint of art, the actor, and the public, 
the dramas that have given tone to the various 
epochs. After a brief but convincing resume of the 
dramatic situation at the close of the eighteenth 
century, in which he makes some striking assertions 
as to the influence of Iffland and Kotzebue then and 
even now, the author passes rapidly over the first 
section (1800-1830) with the dramatic failures of 
the romanticists, devoting a well-proportioned num- 
ber of pages to Kleist (7), Grillparzer (9), Raimund 
(2), and Grabbe (3 ) . The portrayals of the faithful 
wife by Kleist : the superiority of Fate, in Grillpar- 
zer, in that he did not allow it to relieve from moral 
responsibility ; Raimund's genius in pleasing the 
jolly Viennese, and Grabbe's picturing of battles, 
receive just emphasis. In the second division (1830- 
1885) he sets forth the polished but spiritless drama 
of Young Germany in its relation to Hugo, Dumas 
pere, and Scribe; the idealizing drama of Halm, 
Gottschall, Geibel, and Jordan ; Hebbel, with his 
cornerstone of modern dramatic art in " Maria Mag- 
dalena," on whose shoulders Ibsen stands ; Ludwig 
with his excessive reflection and worship of Shake- 
speare ; the deplorable status of the German stage 
around 1870; the years (1874-1890) of brilliant 
service to the German theatre rendered by the 
Meininger company ; the unsurpassed and unsur- 
passable greatness of Wagner, and Wildenbruch 
with his themes from Prussian history. This forms 
the best chapter of the book, because it treats of a 
period old enough to allow the final word as to its 
worth ; and it is this final word that Dr. Witkowski 
has spoken with constant certainty and unbroken 
interest in his theme. The third section (1885- 
1900) begins with a terse analysis of Naturalism, 
at the head of which tendency stands Ibsen, " whose 
influence no one who writes for the stage can escape, 
let him yield ever so reluctantly." For three years 
(1889-1891) the "Free Theatre" existed, and 
widened the scope of the theatre by extending the 
limits of permissibility. The movement as such died 
of inanition. Sudermann is treated as a writer of 
great talents, who often condescends to flatter the 
likings of the public regardless of the infallible laws 
of art. Of Hauptmann's twenty plays, Dr. Wit- 
kowski thinks that scarcely a single one will hold a 
lasting place on the stage, while all will live as 
monuments of this confused and uncertain period. 
The playwrights of the present, Fulda and all the 
rest, are treated only tentatively, and skeptically at 
that. The author seems to begrudge them their 
popularity, taking this latter as an evidence that 
they are living from dramatic art rather than for it. 
As to the future, Dr. Witkowski is at once an opti- 
mist and a pessimist. He sees hope in the fact that 
Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, and Grillparzer are 
more in demand than ever ; he despairs at the low 
grade of drama now being produced in the great 
cities, in the highest intellectual centres. The book 
contains a valuable table showing the number of 
performances of the most popular dramas from 1899 
to 1905, "Tell " leading the list with 412 in 1905. 



Anyone who has read a thrilling tale 
ittZSrl ° nl y ^ find in the last sentence that 

somebody's pink pills will cure pale 
people, can realize the feelings of the reviewer who 
goes through Mr. W. L. Stoddard's " Life of William 
Shakespeare Expurgated " (W. A. Butterfield) and 
discovers in the last paragraph that " in the only 
document identifying William Shakespeare from 
Stratford with the poet, the name of so illustrious 
a contemporary [Lord Bacon] should be secretly 
imbedded." This book, which is a compilation of 
contemporary evidence relating to Shakespeare, 
tries to show that when all inferential matter is 
" expurgated " there is no evidence before his death 
connecting the actor William Shakespeare of Strat- 
ford with the dramatist William Shakespeare of 
London. The connection, so Mr. Stoddard con- 
tends, was not made till the publication of the First 
Folio in 1623. Here we have references to the 
" Sweet Swan of Avon," mention of the Stratford 
monument, and Shakespeare's name heading the list 
of the principal actors in the plays. In other words, 
if it were not for these pieces of information in the 
First Folio we should not know specifically why the 
good folk of Stratford permitted a bust of their 
fellow-townsman to be set up in the church, except 
that they believed that, in the words beneath the 
bust, he was a great genius. The First Folio showed 
wherein his genius lay ; and Mr. Stoddard holds 
that it is the first bit of evidence that has survived 
to identify the citizen of Stratford with the play- 
wright. And it is this part of the Folio that con- 
tains Mr. W. S. Booth's acrostic signature of Francis 
Bacon ! There is, however, a reference which Mr. 
Stoddard quotes but does not satisfactorily get rid 
of ; it is a short poem by John Davies addressed 
" To our English Terence. Mr. Will. Shake-speare " 
(1611 ?). Here Shakespeare is the playwright ; but 
he also " played some kingly parts in sport," and 
thereby fits in with tradition. Now it is admitted 
that the Stratford William Shakespeare acted in the 
dramatist's plays ; therefore there either must have 
been two William Shakespeares acting in plays, or 
the dramatist and the actor are identical. Must we 
" expurgate " the conclusion that the two were one ? 
It is interesting to note that in Professor Wallace's 
article in the March " Harper's " there is contem- 
porary reference to William Shakespeare of Strat- 
ford, and to George Wilkins the dramatist, in the 
Bellott-Mountjoy lawsuit. If what is generally 
admitted is accepted here — that Shakespeare and 
Wilkins collaborated in "Pericles" — we have a 
similar identification ; for it is unlikely that Wilkins 
would be associated so closely with two separate 
William Shakespeares. Further, as Professor Wal- 
lace says, if Shakespeare was a " mere pen-name of 
some one else, it would be difficult to explain how 
he and Wilkins were both interested in the suit . . . 
in behalf of young Bellott, and how the same he and 
Wilkins also wrote two plays together." It seems, 
therefore, that we may believe that Shakespeare is 
Shakespeare still.

Of all bibliographical data, that relat- 

Bibliographv • fo atiases is the mo8t difficult to 
of Atlases, o . . 

obtain. Lowndes dismisses Thomas 
Jefferys with the statement that he was geographer 
to the King and published atlases " which now are 
of little use " ; and this is the almost universal atti- 
tude toward the u out-of-date " atlas. Only very 
slowly is it coming to be recognized as an indispensa- 
ble historical source. A word should be said in 
appreciation of the monumental " List of Geogra- 
phical Atlases in the Library of Congress," compiled 
by Mr. P. Lee Phillips, chief of the division of 
maps and charts. Mr. Phillips gives nearly 3500 
titles, with descriptive notes where needed, and lists 
of the maps relating to America under each impor- 
tant one. Of early atlases the Library of Congress 
possesses all bat three of the forty editions of 
Ptolemy listed by Eames, twenty-two of the folio 
and fifteen of the smaller editions of Ortelius, eleven 
editions of Merca tor's Atlas Major and eight of the 
Atlas Minor ; but the descriptions of these are less 
important than those of the miscellaneous atlases of 
more recent date, since they can be obtained else- 
where. The classification would have been more 
logical had the general atlases preceded the special 
ones ; parts of atlases would not then have come 
before the whole, and reproductions before the 
originals. The order of arrangement is, however, 
comparatively unimportant, since there is an 
exhaustive index of over forty thousand references. 
We think the exact dimensions of volumes should 
have been given, since the terms " folio," "quarto," 
and the like, as applied to atlases, are very indefinite. 
There are necessarily some lacunae. Curiously, the 
Library of Congress has no copy of the English 
edition of the " American Gazeteer," although pos- 
sessing the Italian translation. The supplementary 
list, in which it is intended to describe current 
accessions, will in time fill gaps of this sort. Most 
people may think that this "List" appeals only to 
special students ; but any library can make a small 
collection of atlases, which will possess a constantly 
increasing value, by taking pains to acquire old edi- 
tions which their owners will otherwise relegate first 
to the attic and eventually to the ash-heap. 

Mr. Richard Edgcumbe's " Byron : 

*ES3E» The *** Phase " ( Scribner ) » » 
book which, both as a eulogy and a 

polemic, challenges attention. Its author is well 
known as the Secretary of the National Byron 
Memorial Committee and its historian, and as a 
biographer of Edward Trelawney. This book rec- 
ords the impressions left in the mind of the writer 
after a close study of Byron, persisted in for almost 
forty years. It is divided into three parts — the first 
part being a eulogy of the last phase of the poet's 
career, 1821-1824, and the second and third parts 
a defence of his memory against the most serious 
indictment ever laid against the Byron of earlier 
years. In Part I. we find the writer especially 
emphasizing two points : that the closing scenes of 



the poet's life have not been adequately depicted by 
his biographers ; and that his disposition and conduct 
after leaving Ravenna in 1821 underwent a complete 
transformation. In Part II. he advances the new and 
astonishing claim that the underlying reason for the 
separation of Lord and Lady Byron was a hitherto 
unsuspected relationship existing between the poet 
and Mary Chaworth Musters (1813-1816) ; that 
Mrs. Musters was the mother of the child Medora; 
that she was the Thyrza of the u Thyrza poems " and 
the Astarte of " Manfred " ; and that the endeavor 
to shield her and keep their intimacy unsuspected 
led to a self-restraint in the face of most degrading 
accusations and a self-immolation on the part of 
Augusta Leigh of which a human being seems hardly 
capable. In Part III. we find statements, made by 
Lord Lovelace in "Astarte," argued; we find Au- 
gusta Leigh defended and Lord Lovelace attacked. 
The best parts of the book are those in which the 
writer is least controversial. We should welcome the 
emphasis laid on the good side of the poet's char- 
acter, as shown during his career in Greece ; and the 
record of his laborious days and nights spent in the 
service of an alien people, without, according to 
Byron's own statement and others' belief, desire for 
personal aggrandisement. He had faults, to the end ; 
but the most careful examination of Byron's later 
days shows him a hero. We should regard evidence 
supporting a claim that Byron's life from 1813-1816 
has never till now been adequately understood, as of 
sufficient importance to demand publication. We 
must, however, feel that some assertions on important 
points are but too weakly supported ; and we must 
share the regret of the author that he is "unable more 
precisely to indicate the source of information 
embodied in the concluding portions of the work." 
In his eulogy of Lord Byron's later years, we can 
willingly follow Mr. Edgcumbe ; in his attempt to 
reconstruct our ideas of what happened earlier, we 
can follow him only part way. We cannot, how- 
ever, if we are students of Byron, afford to leave 
the book unread.

the certainty of victory over this most common and 
most justly dreaded foe of humanity. The book 
contains exactly those things which anyone brought 
face to face with consumption should know ; and, 
moreover, the facts are told in such simple language 
that a child could understand them, and with so 
much force that even disbelievers in disease germs 
will feel called upon to follow the eminently sane and 
sensible directions for the recovery of health. The 
gospel here preached is that of outrof -doors, of fresh 
air and sunlight, of abundant food and intelligent 
idleness, and of social responsibility for the care of 
the dependent sufferer from tuberculosis and for 
the vigorous prosecution of efforts to stamp out this 
plague from among men. Everyone interested in

this fight will find encouragement, hope, and inspi- 
ration in this spirited call to arms in the crusade 
against consumption. A very sensible discussion is 
given of what climate can and cannot do for the 
sufferer, and of the importance of this factor in the 
treatment of individual cases. Dr. Hutchinson is 
an enthusiastic admirer of American possibilities in 
this health-resort business, in spite of his insistence 
upon the greater values of food and fresh air ; and 
one strongly suspects that he has summered and 
wintered in Seattle and Los Angeles. 



Leading events In his b ? ok entilled " Romance of 
in the history the American Navy " (Putnam), Mr. 
of our Navy. jjjy \ ia8 wr itten a popular and enter- 
taining account of some thirty or forty of the most 
interesting events in our naval history. A selection 
from the chapter titles will give a notion of the con- 
tents of the book: Commodore Joshua Barney, The 
Lucky Little Enterprise, John Paul Jones, The 
Chesapeake and the Shannon, The Battle of Lake 
Erie, The Duel between the Monitor and the Mer- 
rimac, The Capture of New Orleans by Farragut, 
The Battle of Mobile Bay, and Dewey in Manila 
Bay. One may see from this list that the author 
follows the main travelled roads of our naval history. 
Now and then, however, he departs from them, and 
writes of such little-known events as the building of 
the Red River Dam and the fighting of Ellet's steam 
rams at Memphis. The most original part of his book 
is that treating of the work of the navy in the Civil 
War. Here he has drawn upon his own experiences 
in that struggle, as an officer under Admirals Far- 
ragut, Porter, and Lee. Mr. Hill, in common with 
many other writers, greatly exaggerates the work of 
the privateers during the Revolution and the War of 
1812 (pages v.-vi. ). The most trustworthy statistics 
that we have on this subject show that our shipping 
suffered as much as the British, if not more. The 
book is well printed, and contains numerous illus- 
trations of naval officers, ships, and battles, and a 
fairly good index. 

The people's The poetical philosopher has little 
share in our difficulty in pointing to " the people " 
law-making. ^ j. ne source an( J fountain-head of 
all law and governmental authority. But the hard- 
headed man of fact perceives that only a limited 
number of individuals participate in law-making, 
and that the mass of men watch the process as mere 
observers. The closer reconciliation of fact and 
theory is receiving to-day the thoughtful considera- 
tion of our political reformers. Under the some- 
what misleading title of " The People's Law " 
(Macmillan), Judge Lobingier, now of the Univer- 
sity of Nebraska, has written of the actual partici- 
pation of the people — or rather, of the electorate — 
in the making of law. Brief chapters are devoted 
to ancient and modern instances in countries other 
than the United States, but the bulk of the work 
deals with popular ratification in Colonial America 



and the share of the electorate in the making of our 
state constitutions. Eighteen pages suffice for the 
consideration of popular participation in legislation 
by means of initiative and referendum. The book 
belongs to the field of history rather than of law, 
and is a valuable study in the origins of our state 
constitutions, showing to what extent in actual prac- 
tice popular ratification is a source of our funda- 
mental institutions of government. The work is to 
be particularly commended as an introduction to a 
wealth of original material inaccessible in any other 
single volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The rapidly extending series of " American Crisis 
Biographies " (Jacobs) must perforce include a life of 
Henry Clay. The work of preparing this biography was 
put into the hands of Mr. Thomas Hart Clay, grandson 
of the statesman, who had long been collecting materials 
for such a work. The writer's sudden death interrupted 
the task, but it has been completed in harmony with his 
plan by Mr. Oberholtzer, editor of the series. The work, 
one of love and loyalty to the distinguished ancestor of 
the author, shows no undue prejudice; the writer has 
investigated carefully and tries to hold the balance 
evenly. Of course he believes in his grandfather, but 
he does not find him perfect. It is a good reference 
book for details. 

The student of mathematical history will find quite in- 
valuable Professor David Eugene Smith's " Rara Arith- 
metica" (Ginn & Co.), now made available, in a handsome 
one-volume edition, to many for whom the two-volume 
edition de luxe is quite out of reach. Professor Smith's 
is by far the most elaborate bibliography of arithmetic 
yet attempted. It consists of a chronological catalogue 
of arithmetics printed before 1601, with a full descrip- 
tion of those in the library of Mr. George Arthur 
Plimpton of New York. Mr. Plimpton's collection of 
such texts is the largest that has ever been brought 
together, including over three hundred printed volumes 
— practically every sixteenth-century work of any im- 
portance — besides a number of valuable manuscripts on 
arithmetic, of which a separate list follows that of the 
printed works. The abundant illustrations are often 
of much historical interest, but have in general been 
selected with a view to bibliographical needs. 

" The Rivers and Streams of England " (Macmillan) 
have been admirably painted in color by Mr. Sutton 
Palmer and described by Mr. A. G. Bradley, an enthu- 
siastic angler and an inveterate rambler along English 
hedge-rows. Author and artist have not felt con- 
strained to keep too close company; each has exercised 
his own taste in the matter of selection, the result 
being, no doubt, better pictures and more spirited 
essays than a more constrained method would have 
produced. For example, the Thames figures largely 
in the pictures; in the text, the Severn is more promi- 
nent as being more beautiful and far less familiar both 
to travellers and readers. Scenic description and his- 
toric lore, with some hints to anglers, compose the text. 
The pictures are confined strictly to the natural beauties 
of the English streams, which afford ample material 
for such exploitation.

THE DIAL'S THIRTIETH 
AXNIVERSARY. 



With this issue The Dial commemorates the 
thirtieth anniversary of its founding. Thirty years 
of continuous publication are behind it, during 
which it has never missed an issue. It enters upon 
its fourth decade in the same hands and the same 
spirit in which its publication was begun, May 1, 
1880. Few are the journals that have been con- 
ducted by the same man for so long a period ; fewer 
still are those which after thirty years remain in 
the hands of their founder and first editor, who has 
conducted it continuously throughout that period, 
making the history of the journal in a peculiar sense 
the history of an individual. 

The Dial has not been given to self-glorification 
or the exploitation of personality. If the letters 
that are printed herewith are somewhat intimate in 
tone and warm in appreciation, some explanation 
may perhaps be found in the facts above indicated. 
The letters derive an interest from the varied per- 
sonalities and viewpoints of their writers, and it is 
in them, rather than in any words of our own, that 
we prefer to commemorate the occasion that has 
called them forth. 



LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. 



As I am the only one, except the editor and founder 
of The Dial, left of those who contributed to its first 
number thirty years ago, I perhaps may be entitled to 
lead the chorus of congratulations on the completion of 
its third decade. I greet my " fellow veteran," rejoic- 
ing that he is still at the helm of the craft he has guided 
so long and well, and glad that he is finding the rewards 
of faithful service highly planned and highly wrought. 
Few in these grasping, selfish, and avaricious days can 
contemplate three decades of such honorable, uplifting, 
and self-sacrificing effort, brought to such deserved 
success. George P. Upton*. 

Chicago, April 20. 

I am glad to hear of your Anniversary celebration ; to 
which I can, however, contribute little, unless it be 
conveyed in the following reminiscence. I am prob- 
ablv one of the few men living who habitually read 
the original "Dial" on its quarterly appearance, and per- 
haps the only person who had the honor of having some 
verses of his own rejected in the last number of its early 
existence (in April 1844) by its editor, Ralph Waldo 
Emerson. The following was his delicious reply to my 
"Sunset Thoughts," as they were modestly entitled: 

*' Perhaps I may not print your verses in * The Dial.' They 
have truth and earnestness ; and a happier hour may add that 
external perfection which can neither be commanded nor 
described." 

To this he kindly added, as a P.S. : " Perhaps after fur- 
ther reflection I may print these verses in ' The Dial.' " 
But this he wisely abstained from doing; and more than 
one younger writer than myself may have been consoled 
in later years, when I have quoted to him this gentle 
but resistless verdict of our most revered leader.

Let me join with the rest to congratulate The Dial, 
and to congratulate yourself, who are The Dial that 
we know. We recognize that The Diai has taken to 
itself the function of criticism of current literature, un- 
influenced by any other consideration. It has held this 
function from the first, and without change of purpose 
or policy. We know that whatever may be said in its 
pages is the honest judgment of a competent authority. 
We value the visits of The Dial as we value the speech 
of a wise friend, and we hope that many generations of 
scholars may enjoy the same high privilege.

Congratulations to The Dial on its thirtieth birth- 
day. For us who are 

" Up to the chin in the Pierian flood," 
it is uniquely valuable, both for authoritative news of 
the progress of the rise, and for wise comment on its 
source and direction. Ferris Greenslet. 

Boston, April 16. 

To those who cherish the interests of literature and 
criticism in its shaping of the standards of living and 
the ideals of life, the survival of The Dial for thirty 
years is at once a consolation and a triumph. It may 
be accepted as a welcome sign that the still small voice 
is not wholly still, nor too insignificant to make an im- 
pression in spite of the din of a noisier journalism. It 
is through its acceptance conscientiously of the respon- 
sibilities of leadership that The Dial has achieved a 
success which must be weighed rather than counted to 
express its numerical status. With no assumption of 
superiority and no tendency to hold itself aloof from 
popular interest, it combines the sympathy of a view 
from the inside with the objective independence of a 
critical and poised observer. It is natural that con- 
tributors are willing to bring to such a purpose an ap- 
preciative and disinterested cooperation. It is at once 
a privilege and a pleasure to be enrolled in such a 
group, and to extend to The Dial cordial good wishes 
for further decades of prosperity. 

Joseph Jastrow. 
University of Wisconsin, April 18. 

I am delighted by the word from you suggested by 
the approaching Thirtieth Anniversary of The Dial. 
Your recollection of the fact that a long time ago I was 
a contributor is very gratifying. I only wish that I had 
been more essentially associated with a paper that has 
maintained such high standards. I see The Dial is 
praised on all sides, apropos of its coming anniversary ; 
but it has long been recognized as holding an honored 
place quite all its own. Franklin* MacYeagh. 

Washington. D. C. April 25. 

Having been one of The Dial's " constant readers " 
almost from the beginning, news of its approaching 
Thirtieth Anniversary came to me with something of a 
shock; for I had not appreciated that time had sped so 
fast. To a public institution like The Dial, however, 
age brings prestige rather than decay, so that it may 
indeed be congratulated upon having attained so ripe 
an experience. The Dial occupies a unique position; 
it is not only the sole journal among us exclusively 
devoted to literary criticism, but it is unsurpassed and 
almost unrivalled in the quality, strength, and indepen- 
dence of its reviews. Librarians with literary constitu- 
encies find that nowhere else than in the pages of The 
Dial can they obtain such a body of serious and trust-

all manner of good wishes to you, and profound thanks 
for your thirty years of yeoman service in behalf of

Stale Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison, April l/„ 



I offer my message of congratulation and good-will 
on the occasion of the Thirtieth Anniversary of your 
admirable journal of letters. In breath of view, in 
sympathy, and in fairness, The Dial gives me keen 
satisfaction. May it have a long and helpful career, to 
instruct us all in sound canons of literary criticism and 
their application to the publications of our time. 

Nicholas Murray Butler. 

Columbia University , New York, April 15. 



Do you, dear Editor of the The Dial, remember in 
the long ago when a little band of heretics assembled in 
the old Unitarian Church of the Messiah to consider the 
possibilities of starting a new journal in the interest of 
" Kingdom Come," and you were present, by invitation 
of Robert Collyer, as a likely young fellow to take 
editorial charge of the same? And how we balloted for 
names — the only one which I remember being Robert 
Collyer's suggestion that the paper be called "The 
Head-Light " and that the title-page be illuminated 
with a great locomotive in full steam and a flaming 
head-light throwing its rays over the title? Fortunately 
for you, the scheme was too embryonic, the dream too 
chaotic and quixotic, to entangle you, and you were 
providentially saved for a more fitting job. I, for better 
or for worse, was entangled, and the dream was launched : 
it was shortly before you pushed your canoe from shore. 
You will pardon the presumption on my part, when I con- 
fess that " Unity " and The Dial have been intimately 
associated in my fancy as a sort of twin-venture. They 
were born out of the same impulse ; I believe they have 
been sustained by the same faiths in the receptive 
power of common, plain, every-day human nature, and 
that the wheels have been kept moving by the same con- 
fidence that the Universe is favorable to excellence, and, 
as Emerson says, " The dice of God are loaded " in the 
interest of things beautiful and fair. You, steering the 
Dial craft, have " made good." Your canoe has been 
replaced by a skiff, and now you are running at least a 
respectable yacht. Mine is still a crazy raft, and the most 
that can be said to my credit is that I have kept the thing 
afloat, and that I have not fallen overboard. But I 
rejoice in your success. Indeed, I have rejoiced in it 
continuously. I am sure no one can be prouder of 
The Dial's Thirtieth Anniversary than the editor of 
" Unity," its luckless twin that has never known enough 
to know when it was beaten, and so lives on. 

Jenkin Lloyd Jones. 
Lincoln Centre, Chicayo, April 28. 

It is a pleasure to congratulate The Dial upon its 
thirtieth birthday, and a comfort to know that its vigor 
increases with age; for certainly a protest against 
" smart " criticism was never more needed. I like The 
Dial because it takes its work seriously. I admit that 
I am most edified when, the subject permitting, its 
sincerity expresses itself in a not too sombre mood. But 
in a day when we learn flippancy before the ink of our 
first typewriter ribbon is cleansed from our fingers, it is 
more than a comfort — it is a blessing — that a journal 
of serious criticism should be entering so auspiciously 
upon a fourth decade. Henry S. Canby. 

Yale University , April 18. 



I have studied The Dial all the days of its life, since 
it first came to my desk in London bringing welcome 
news of literary doings in America; and it is with almost 
a shock that I realize this was a generation ago ! I 
think that The Dial commended itself to English 
readers from the beginning, perhaps because it had 
more of a world-outlook, was less ephemeral in tone 
and more dignified in character, than most American 
literary journals at that time. In saying this I do not 
of course forget my good old friend " The Nation," for 
which I sometimes wrote in the Garrison days. In The 
Dial we have for years found sound helpful criticism, 
sane far-seeing views, and the best guidance to the 
product of the world of thought, — not of its own day 
alone, for in The Dial we have had some of the best 
appraisements of the literary products of past times 
also. The literary judgments of The Dial have rarely 
erred; they command the respect of the world of letters 
in two hemispheres; and the fact that they have done 
so for one generation inspires the belief that The Dial 
will continue wisely to record, not alone the years as 
they pass, but the things we do in them, for generations 
to come. Charles Welsh. 

Scranton, Pa., April 17. 

The motto of my sun-dial, / mark only sunny hours, 
is ever to me the motto of my Chicago Dial. Hours of 
brightest sunshine and cheer, with never a moment of 
gloom or depression, have been mine in the many years 
during which I have had the pleasure and profit of 
reading The Dial. May the light be seen for a century 
on those clean clear pages. Alice Morse Earle. 

Brooklyn, N. Y., April 2U. 

May I extend my congratulations on occasion of the 
Thirtieth Anniversary of the publication of The Dial ? 
The service rendered to our city by a paper conducted 
in accordance with such ideals cannot be measured or 
weighed, and cannot easily be put in words. I feel that 
those who have so faithfully given their time to main- 
tain such a force in our community are entitled to the 
thanks and the congratulations of all. 

Harry Pratt Judson. 

University of Chicago, April 21. 

No one who cares for the good fortune of letters in 
America ought to neglect to wish The Dial many 
happy returns of the day on its Thirtieth Anniversary. 
In the midst of so much that is fleeting and futile in 
our periodical literature, it is a great satisfaction and 
encouragement to have anything so sober and sound as 
The Dial. But it is more than that; for it is always 
alive and open-minded, kindly without being indiscrimi- 
nating, and dignified without being dull. That is a 
great deal to be proud of. May I offer my heartiest 
congratulations on the happy occasion, with highest 
hopes for the future ? Bliss Carman. 

New Canaan, Conn., April 19. 

Let me congratulate you upon the position of respect 
and usefulness you and your fellow- workers have gained 
for The Dial among lovers and students of literature. 
It stands alone in a calm liberating atmosphere of its 
own. May you long go on with your suggestive criti- 
cism and deep sincerity of aim, evoking as it will crea- 
tive moods out of which will be born what we all long 
to hail — a Literature worthy in its compass of thought 
and feeling, beauty and charm, of a country so vast, so 
great, and (I hope) to be so exalted for its righteous- 
ness, as ours. Morris Schaff.

I send my cordial greetings on the Thirtieth Anni- 
versary of The Dial. It is clear that you do measure 
time, and a good deal of it; hence your title is well 
chosen. But it is just as well to note the fact that you 
do not merely "mark time" — you progress; and you 
are doing fine work for the cause of literature in this 
country. Long may you prosper. W. P. Trent. 

Columbia Univertity , New York, April 18. 

The Dial has always been true to its name — it has 
marked time by the sun. Truth, Beauty, Justice, and 
Righteousness have been the quarters through which for 
thirty vibrant years its gnomon has circled. Yet is its 
circuit not a closed one, but, rather, by its precession 
does it ever bring us forward into a larger and brighter 
day. Happy are we all that he who for so many years 
has steadfastly set its face open to the light of Heaven is 
still there. In his reverent and dauntless spirit, his love 
for everything that is true and good and holy, his sor- 
row for everything that mars and defaces the fair face 
of nature and of humanity, we read the secret of The 
Dial. May he for years still to come be at the centre, 
where the sun is always shining. John J. Halsey.

Heartiest greeting to The Dial and its editor on 
the Thirtieth Anniversary of its distinguished career in 
American literary criticism. Its work is indispensable. 
Robert Underwood Johnson. 

yew York, April 27. 

To have The Dial measuring the sunny hours during 
thirty years, is one of the wonders of the American lit- 
erary world. My long experience with nations that set 
value on longevity makes me take off my hat to The 
Dlal. I welcome the shadow-lines it casts according to 
time's measurements, yet guided by eternal order and 
principle. May The Dial measure many more sunny 
hours, and aid me, as I strive with the editor — may I 
not say the consecrated champion of literary justice and 
critical truth-seeking ? — to add my beam to the kindly 
light. William Elliot Griffis.

I congratulate The Dial upon its Thirtieth Anniver- 
sary. Best wishes to yourself — who are, and always 
have been, The Dial. Henry B. Fuller. 

Chicago, April S6. 

It was not a very exceptional thing to start a new 
periodical thirty years ago, but to have done so and to 
see it a living and influential element in the literary life 
of to-day is a bit of success not granted to many adven- 
turers in that field. And the success is all the more 
praiseworthy when it is remembered that the whole 
thirty years show no single moment of faltering in the 
maintenance of the high ideals which gave The Dial 
birth. Those of us who know something of the burden 
which you have personally carried in this work appre- 
ciate our indebtedness to your perseverance all the 
more deeply on that account. W. H. Johnson. 

Denison University, Ohio, April SO. 

Most sincere congratulations on the occasion of the 
Thirtieth Anniversary of the birth of The Dial. The 
Dial has stood throughout for all that is best in the 
evaluation of current literature. It has won a place of 
its own as a fearless and absolutely impartial review; 
and everyone who values these rare qualities must wish 
The Dial many more years of usefulness. 

Lawrence J. Burpee. 

The Carnegie Library, Ottawa, Canada, April 15. 



In offering The Dial, as I do, my hearty congratu- 
lations on the completion of its thirtieth year, I am re- 
minded of its steadiness and fidelity to high ideals and 
the best traditions of literature ; of its confidence in the 
integrity of human nature — a confidence which asserts 
that a man will still write the truth though he must sign 
his name beneath; and of the respect with which its 
verdicts are and have long been received throughout the 
world. May it prosper as it deserves! 

Clark S. Northup. 

Cornell Univertity. April 17. 

It must be a satisfaction of no mean quality — as well 
as size — to have kept a literary journal true to the 
highest ideals of criticism for thirty years. The Dial 
has been absolutely honest, fearless, and impartial. It 
has never had pets — either among publishers or 
authors. There has never been a whisper regarding 
the absolute integrity of its criticisms. And, however 
severely I might be handled, of one thing I felt sure, — 
at least that the critic had read every vital page of the 
book. That means a great deal to a writer.

I most heartily congratulate you, as the soul of The 
Dial, on the completion of its Thirtieth Anniversary. 
The Dial has been a stimulus to all literary workers, 
because of its high and noble ideals. You have made it 
an indispensable helper to all of us. 

Ira Maurice Price. 

Univertity of Chicago, April 18. 

Thirty years of intelligent and honest criticism ! 
Good for The Dial, say I; and honor with long life to 
the men who have made and kept it what it is. 

Bradford Torrey. 

Santa Barbara, Calif., April SO. 

I take much pleasure in adding my testimony to the 
great service which The Dial has done for the devel- 
opment of proper literary standards in this country. I 
have always taken great pleasure and pride in calling 
the attention of my friends in the East, and in Europe, 
who asked about conditions of civilization in the Missis- 
sippi Valley, to The Dial. We have all taken a per- 
sonal interest in its prosperity, are proud of its success, 
and wish it the utmost prosperity in the future. 

Edmund J. James. 

Univertity of Ulinoit, April 18. 

Greetings and many happy returns to The Dial. It 
stands for all that is scholarly, just, and true, in 
American letters. Chas. F. Holder. 

Pasadena, Calif., April SO. 

A journal of literary criticism which sets out calling 
itself by the name of that trustworthy old friend of 
m a nkin d, the dial, and which succeeds in living up to 
its name, is rightly the object of congratulation because 
of its consistency and of thanks for the service it ren- 
ders. In a country and at a time in which production 
of books is so facile and abundant, and in which the 
best — for reasons of commerce, prejudice, favoritism, 
banality of taste, or ignorance — too often runs danger 
of enjoying both less fame and less material support 
than the second-best or even the worst, it is necessary 
to the good health of both writer and reader to have at 
least one or two journals of dial-like solidity and per- 
manence, of dial-like steadfastness and indifference to 
the random fluctuations of temperature and breeze, of

dial-like security from the accidents that beset the 
dollar watch or from the noise that clamors from the 
steeple clock, of dial-like constancy to one great source 
of light — in a word, of dial-like sense and sobriety and 
reliability. Those who feel the need of a reliable time- 
piece to help them know the literary time of day are 
grateful to The Dial for its unity and integrity of 
purpose, for its reviews written by men who read the 
books they review, for its resistance of the old tempta- 
tion to be smart rather than truthful, and for its edito- 
rial championship of the literary and critical ideal. 
They wish it long continuation of usefulness and pros- 
perity. Grant Showerman. 
University of Wisconsin, April 22. 

I beg to send you sincere greetings on the Thirtieth 
Anniversary of your journal's significant career. Sus- 
tained and unobtrusive excellence is rare in this clamor- 
ous market ; and your readers are grateful to you for it. 
Congratulations and God-speed to The Dial. 

Percy Mackaye. 
Cornish, N. II., April 19. 



The Dial's Thirtieth Anniversary ought to be matter 
for congratulation to all Americans. There is only one 
other periodical of ours which can be ranked with it 
for honesty and independence. Its continued existence 
and usefulness pleasantly reassure us against the fear 
that one congested Eastern city is to continue to absorb 
most of the writing men of promise in the new world, 
as well as most of the incoming Hebrews and Slavs of 
the old one. H. W. Boynton. 

Bristol, R. I., April 25. 

Let me send you every message of congratulation 
on the happy occasion of your Thirtieth Anniversary. 
During these thirty years, as I wrote ten years ago, 
The Dial has seemed to me the most unbiassed, good- 
humored, and sensible organ of American criticism. 

Barrett Wendell. 

Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass., April 15. 

Many thanks to the forces of Heaven and Earth, and 
to all concerned in the existence and influence of The 
Dial! The name, glorious in American literature, has 
been made still more illustrious by the conduct of this 
periodical, for whose presence and power every lover of 
good literature must be grateful. Noble traditions and 
a prophetic vision have characterized every issue that 
has come to us here at the Armour Institute, as for years 
before the beginning of our work among the young men 
it came to my study table. No teacher of English lit- 
erature can afford to let this anniversary occasion pass 
without rejoicing with those who have students under 
their charge that we have had thirty years of this steady 
onward-moving guidance. F. W. Gunsaulus. 

Armour Institute of Technology , Chicago, April 17. 

My congratulations on the Thirtieth Anniversary of 
The Dial. I have known The Dial for just fifteen 
of its thirty years, and in that time respect for the sin- 
cerity and candor of its reviews has grown to admira- 
tion for the high ideals of its editor and affection for 
the journal itself. Ephraim Douglass Adams. 

Stanford University, Calif '., April 18. 

Congratulations warm and sincere to The Dial and 
its editor, for the thirty years of splendid work per- 
formed with courage, tact, wisdom, and grace : a 
remarkable record, of which all who know it may well 
be proud. J. H. Crooker. 

Boston, April 16. 



I have known The Dial from the day it was born, 
and read it by fits and starts with pleasure and profit 
down to the last numbers, and I think it has no rival in 
the literary journals of our own land. The last num- 
bers I have read with especial satisfaction. 

Robert Collyer. 

New York, April 23. 

Let me congratulate you upon the happy completion 
of the thirtieth year of The Dial, a very notable 
achievement — -more notable, I think, than Mr. God- 
kin's, because " The Nation " by including politics made 
a wider appeal for popular support. I have faith that 
the men who do the good work in this world will receive 
eventual recognition, even though their names do not 
crowd the headlines of the daily press. 

F. H. Hodder. 
University of Kansas, April 19. 



" Remember, brethren, that the Lord did n't send 
down all the Holy Ghost he had over in Palestine on 
the day of Pentecost." Thus spake with unction once 
an old minister out on the far edge of California. And 
I want to announce in the same spirit of prophecy that 
the genius of Culture has not centred all her gifts on the 
eastern seaboard of our country. I cannot here speak 
of the virile verse and fiction that have risen beyond the 
Alleghanies. But speaking only of literary criticism, 
I wish to say that The Dial, out in the heart of the 
nation, has continuously and consistently stood for the 
highest ideals; has been quick to discern and keen to 
encourage everything making for righteousness in the 
world of American letters. All success to its high 
purpose! Edwin Markham. 

West New Brighton, N. Y„ April 25. 

The Dial has long been a favorite among the lit- 
erary periodicals that I regularly read, and I always 
take pleasure in commending it as I find opportunity. 
I seldom have to disagree with its critical decisions, 
and never doubt their honesty and impartiality. The 
special attention given to library management is one 
of the best among its minor features, and exceptional 
withal. W. J. Rolfe. 

Cambridge, Mass., April 20. 

I send you my hearty greetings and congratulations on 
your having reached the Thirtieth Anniversary of The 
Dial, both editor and paper sound of mind and body, 
and rich in the affectionate appreciation of a large and 
ever growing circle of friends. J. C. Brannk.r. 

Stanford University, Calif., April 20. 

Prevented until now by illness, I can only even at 
present dictate a line — ■ too tardily, I fear — to con- 
gratulate The Dial on reaching its thirtieth birthday 
and on having fulfilled the unique mission it, so fortu- 
nately for American letters, appointed to itself in 1880. 
I wish I could write more. I rejoice to believe that the 
larger part of The Dial's life and exceptional useful- 
ness lies still before it. George W. Cable. 

Northampton, Mass., April 26. 



To find out and praise the good, to run down and kill 
the bad, to pass judgment on the tolerable and put it in 
the right line of probation, — these duties of a journal 
of criticism you have done, and done well. May you 
have your reward in discovering that great American 
author, who, by all sound reckoning, is to come one of 
these days out of the Middle West ! 

Francis B. Gummere.

THE DIAL 



329 



Please accept my cordial congratulations on your 
Thirtieth Anniversary. The Dial has stood almost 
alone in these thirty years for high standards in litera- 
ture and for ideals in both literature and scholarship. 
It has always had the courage of its convictions, for 
which above all else it deserves the approval of everyone 
who possesses enlightenment or who seeks after it. 

Harry Thurston Peck. 

Columbia University, New York, April 16. 

It is a privilege to send greetings to The Dial, and 
to wish it long continuance of life and prosperity, and 
the fewest changes in form and spirit that are consistent 
with progress. Edward S. Martin. 

New York City, April 17. 

It is a pleasure to write you a word of congratulation 
on your Thirtieth Anniversary. I hope to have the 
same pleasure at the fortieth — not to say the fiftieth — 
with the same foimder and editor at the helm. It is 
something worth while to have a place where you can 
say your say on the literature that stirs you (or does 
not stir you), without fear of publisher, editor, or 
reader. The Dial has always been an opportunity for 
the writer as well as the reader. And when we look 
at our American periodicals in general, we see what 
reason we have to be thankful for such an opportunity. 

Edwabd E. Hale, Jr. 

Union College, New York, April 19. 

Let me, as one of your interested readers for many 
years, joy with you on the occasion of your Thirtieth 
Anniversary. And so, I believe, ought all lovers of the 
best in literature and in life. Few indeed are they who 
can offer such a worthy record in the world of letters. 
The Middle West particularly, and the entire country 
generally, ought to wish you many happy returns of the 
event. Duane Mowry. 

Milxcaukee, Wi*., April 16. 

For a good many years I have looked to The Dial 
to indicate the true course of literary light, and it has 
never disappointed me. I regard it as the sanest and 
most trustworthy book journal published in America. 
Let me offer hearty congratulations on your thirtieth 
birthday. James A# b Scherer, 

Throop Institute. Pasadena, Calif., April 13. 

Please accept our hearty congratulations upon the 
results of thirty long years devoted to upholding the 
higher standards of literary journalism. It is good to 
realize that anything so sane can go steadily forward. 
It refutes the charge that with us nothing is desirable 
except change, and that only mediocrity succeeds. Our 
best wishes for the future success of The Dial, which 
starts next month on its road to a fiftieth anniversary. 
John Lane Company, 
Rctgkr Bleecker Jewett, Manager. 

New York. April SI. 

I wish to add my congratulations to those of your 
many other friends on The Dial's thirtieth birthday. 
I always feel that a review in The Dial is trustworthy. 
Opinions and judgments differ, but literary appreciation 
of the finer sort is a species of intuition and can seldom 
go far wrong. Add to this a literary conscience, and 
you have the rare combination which has made The 
Dial what it is. It never sacrifices truth to brilliancy 
or says an unjust thing in order to make a telling phrase. 
It is more than interesting, — it is reliable. 

Walter Taylor Fteld. 
Chicago, April tt. 



Allow me to congratulate you most sincerely on the 
completion of the thirtieth year of The Dial. I do 
not know of any similar paper in this country which has 
maintained a higher ideal or followed a more consistent 
practice in independent criticism. I wish you many 
another anniversary of this high enterprise. 

Woodrow Wilson. 

Princeton University , N. J., April 19. 

I send my cordial greetings to The Dial on its com- 
pletion of thirty years of service to literature and cul- 
ture. Too few of our periodicals have survived the 
temptation to be an excuse for half an inch of adver- 
tisements; only a very few are seriously devoted to 
literature as a special field. May The Dial continue 
to be an honored exception for many a decade to come. 

John Erskine. 

Columbia University, New York, April tl. 

Congratulations and many happy returns ! It is pos- 
sibly not in order for a contributor to comment on the 
success of his journal, but he may perhaps be allowed 
to testify to the wisdom and daring of his editor. The 
timidity of the average American editor answers to the 
tyranny of American public opinion. We have nothing 
like the intellectual freedom which centuries of struggle 
have won for Europe. But the editor of The Dial 
has never been afraid to risk his circulation and adver- 
tising for the sake of the right, in the defense of 
unpopular causes, or to keep alive free discussion. To 
have done this for thirty years is to be a great editor. 
Like the Parliament man in Charles the First's time, 
he has told the truth and not been hanged for it. 

Charles Leonard Moore. 
Moorestown, N. J., April 16. 

Congratulations and good wishes for The Dial's 

Thirtieth Anniversary. I have been a sincere admirer 

of The Dial for many years. It has consistently stood 

for the best things in life and literature throughout its 

career, and I have long felt the most entire confidence 

in its literary and other judgments. 

_ Oscar Fay Adams. 

Boston, April IS. 

Our generation has entered more fully into the free- 
dom of thought than the generations that have gone 
before us. We have not been without our vagaries, but 
we have had our revelations. Our methods of expres- 
sion have suffered a similar relaxation, with more of loss 
and less of gain. There has been a lax impressional 
and vulgar quality in our utterance, which has interfered 
with the weight and quality of truth. A sensuous and 
pictorial form has prevailed which has obstructed men- 
tal illumination. We are glad that The Dial has been 
content with the fight with none of its bewildering sheen. 



William* College, Mass., April 19. 



John Bascom. 



My hearty congratulations on this anniversary of 
The Dial. While I cannot claim an acquaintance of 
thirty years, for at least two-thirds of the period 
measured by The Dial's existence I have regularly 
enjoyed its monthly and later its semi-monthly advent. 
Clear, clean-cut, handsome in its page and type, digni- 
fied and scholarly in tone, The Dial deserves the splen- 
did recognition it has received. Its leading articles, its 
literary essays, its critical reviews, have been models in 
their kind. Who ever read a pert or supercilious com- 
ment in The Dial? Well do I remember a certain 
emphatic and indiscreet communication written with 
sophomoric fervor in Quixotic defense of much-maligned

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



" poor little Jane " Austen, which was returned with a 
charming letter from the editor. He expressed full 
and hearty agreement with the writer's sentiment and 
his vehement attack upon the traducer, — nay, he even 
added the comforting statement, " So and so is undoubt- 
edly an ass — but let's not say it in The Dial,." Thus 
his skilful touch upon the regulator has kept the inner 
works in accurate adjustment; the pendulum has never 
lost its calm steadiness of swing; the hands have duly 
registered the critical judgment of a generation; and 
The Dial's open face has ever recorded standard 
time. It is a great achievement; and we of the Middle 
West are proud of The Dial, — not that it is a product 
of the Middle West, or that it is the representative of 
the Middle West, but because in Chicago we have had 
for thirty years a publication representative of the 
world of letters, a journal which has so admirably filled 
its place in letters, and an editor whose literary ideals 
have had no small influence upon the taste and judgment 
of his time. I send my best wishes for the future pros- 
perity of The Dial, and my sincere regard. 

W. E. Simonds. 
Knox College, Illinois, April 19. 

The Dial has, from the outset, consistently upheld 
high standards of thinking and speaking. In both ways 
it has performed a long and a lasting service; and it 
deserves what it has solidly won - — the great respect of 
those who in this country recognize the vital alliance 
between criticism and creativeness. No other American 
publication known to me has so uniformly held its pages 
above the level of spleen and personalia. 

^ i n-. , •, ™ James Lane Allen. 

New York City, April 20. 



It is no ordinary achievement to have held up before 
a reading public for thirty years a Dial on which is 
recorded faithfully, without prejudice or subsidy, the 
progress of the world of literature and thought. I con- 
gratulate not only the management but the public as 
well. Edwin Erle Sparks. 

Pennsylvania State College, April 18. 



The Dial's shadow is of steady enlightenment, 
marking in clear outline the figure of Truth. Its thirty 
years of casting a quiet shadow of keen judgment, just 
criticism, and human touch on the brain and heart of a 
public is a surprising refutation of the popular belief 
that sensationalism is the sine qua non of success. 

_ . . _ _ . ., .„ A. Maurice Low. 

Washington, D. C, April 19. 

Among American periodicals there is no such other 
record as The Dial's. Great journalism has pivoted 
always — and always must — upon a personality. The 
singleness, the consistency, the purpose and standards, 
"without variableness or shadow of turning," which 
make Character, must derive from an undivided master. 
Else there is a wobble. We like people and papers 
that we know where to find. In the average Press, we 
do n't know. They are acephalous, but full of "hands." 
They record the "pressure" like isobaric lines on a 
weather-map — now up, now down, and always wavy. 
Greeley and Bowles and Dana, Garrison and Curtis and 
Pixley — six different kinds, but all Individuals — were 
more implicitly trusted, I think, by more Americans of 
mind than to-day trust all the papers in the United 
States put together. Circulation is one thing ; " infloo- 
ence " is another; but conviction by mental leadership — 
that is the greatest thing that ever befalls a journal. 
All those other oracles of our Golden Age are gone. 



But here is the quiet Dial marking now its thirtieth 
birthday — consecutive still under the same sensitive, 
serene, unswerving bridle-hand, and all and always in 
Chicago! It is not so much a "record " as a benediction. 
The Dial stands alone now in American letters — a 
monument and an example. And this is because it has n't 
had to keep swapping minds. Many an able seaman has 
helped to trim its sails and stow its cargoes ; but at the 
wheel always the one steady hand. Power to The Dial! 
May its shadow never fall less true to the Hour and its 
need. Chas. F. Lummis. 

Los Angeles, Cal., April 20. 



I feel that I owe a most hearty greeting to The Dial 
on its Thirtieth Anniversary, in return for the unalloyed 
satisfaction it has given me all these years. I am sure 
that all its readers will join with me not only in the 
greeting, but in the hope of its continued prosperity 
along the lines it has hitherto followed. 

New York City, April 18. HENRY M. AlDEN. 



The Dial hi its present estate has lived a generation. 
May a century hence find it flourishing like a green bay 
tree ; for such a paper is sorely needed. In my opinion, 
we have in this country no equal organ for the discussion 
of art, literature, and the things of the mind in general. 
The West should regard your publication as one of its 
most honorable assets. Richard Burton. 

University of Minnesota, April H. 

Greeting to The Dial, and best wishes for many 
more decades of usefulness and increasing influence. 
May it ever keep in the Sun, and tell in Straight Lines 
the Passing Time to all who linger in the Garden of 
Letters. Charles Atwood Kofoid. 

University of California, April 22. 

Of course I am glad to add my tribute to the steady 
merit and courage of your Dial, if we may ascribe such 
human virtues to that friend of the Sun which counts 
no hours except the serene ones, but is no less faith- 
fid in cloudy weather, if we may credit the author of 
" Hudibras,"— 

" True as the dial to the sun, 
Although it be not shined upon." 

It is pleasant to see that your Dial has enjoyed more 
sunshine than the two American magazines that pre- 
ceded yours — Emerson's quarterly which you mention 
with deserved praise, andMoncure Conway's Cincinnati 
monthly of that name, published by him for a single 
year, which you pass over in silence. It deserves to 
be recalled, however, partly for Conway's spirit and 
enthusiasm in setting it up in that bear-garden which 
Cincinnati proved to be in his case, though it stood 
there but for a year; and partly for his contributors, 
who were Emerson, Howells, Octavius Frothingham, 
Conway, and (for verses only) myself, among others 
who are now less known. Short as its career was, it 
justified Conway's pleasing figure in presenting its first 
number to the world, — " symbolized," he said, " not so 
much by the sun-clock as by the floral dial of Linnaeus, 
which recorded the advancing day by the opening of 
some flowers and the closing of others: it would report 
the Day of God as recorded in the unfolding of higher 
life and thought, and the closing-up of old superstitions 
and evils. It would fain be a Dial measuring time 
by growth." Such has been the mission of your own 
Dial, to which so many good pens have contributed, 
and for which I have occasionally written an article. 
Had I been mature enough in 1844, when but twelve

years of age, I should doubtless have sent verses to 
Emerson's Dial, which was a harbor for youthful poesy 
as well as for the oracular oak of Concord, the New 
England Dodona from whose leaves we heard the 
"Sphynx" and "Wood-Notes," and that epigram 
worthy of the Greek Anthology, — 

" The sense of the world is short. 
Long and various the report. — 

To love and be beloved ; 
Men and gods have not outlearned it. 
And. how oft soe'er they've turned it, 
Not to be improved." 
And now, one of your oldest readers, I salute your 
Anniversary with faith, hope, and charity, which every 
journal, old or youthful, needs. jr. B. Sanborn.

edited by LunwiG Lewisohn. $1.00 net. Published in 1838, it has a 
peculiar interest for the present day, for it was the fruit of the 
psychotherapeutic movement which parallels the one that is receiv- 
ing so much attention in our time. 

Db. Worcester of the Emmanuel Movement says of this book: 
" It contains the principles of our whole project, and expresses many 
phases of our thought better than we are able to express it."

Wisconsin. In The Art of Life Series. 50 cents net. The first part. 
Latter Day Sinners, compares the old forms of wrong-doing with the 
more refined violations of law and morals current to-day. The sec- 
ond part. Latter Day Saints, presents former ideals of virtue as well 
as those whiih have evolved as a result of twentieth century civiliza- 
tion. Professor Ross's keenness in analyzing social disorders and 
fearlessness in prescribing remedies are always st imul at in g.

" The portrait [Abraham Lincoln] is an admirable one, and the etch- 
ing is as striking and strong as those which have preceded it. The 
rugged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the 
deep lines of care that furrow the brow are significant of the period of 
storm and stress." — New York Herald.

"Mr. JACQUES REICH, 1 Madison Ave., N. Y. 

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham 
Lincoln, when I took it to be framed for the President, and it is the best 
likeness of him. ... I am the only living body guard of Abraham 
Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to ~ne today, as when he was living. I would love so much to 
have one of those etchings if you will kindly tell me how I can get one.

GEORGE MEREDITH 
JAMES M. BARRIE 

AN INTERESTING SOUVENIR OF 
TWO FAMOUS LITERARY MEN 

NEITHER DORKING NOR 
THE ABBEY By j. m. barrie 

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob- 
ably the most appropriate and beautiful was that 
contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's tine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

QUALITY 

vs. 

QUANTITY 



A MONG other sensible remarks, a 

** writer in " The American Printer " 

had this to say recently : 

"A short time ago I read the claims of a 
newspaper business manager who was talking big 
circulation. He claimed that a man out shooting 
ducks would stand a better chance of success by 
firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock. 
And so he would if they were all ducks. But if 
ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and 
gulls, and crows, and herons, he would do better 
if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock. 
Circulation does n't mean much. It 's the canvas- 
backs in the flock that count, — in other words, 
financial standing and probable interest of audience 
that the book publisher must consider. What 's 
the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five 
hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of 
that number didn't know there was that much

QUALITY 

vs. 

QUANTITY 



A MONG other sensible remarks, a 

writer in " The American Printer " 

had this to say recently : 

" A short time ago I read the claims of a 
newspaper business manager who was talking big 
circulation. He claimed that a man out shooting 
ducks would stand a better chance of success by 
firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock. 
And so he would if they were all ducks. But if 
ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and 
gulls, and crows, and herons, he would do better 
if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock. 
Circulation does n't mean much. It 's the canvas- 
backs in the flock that count, — in other words, 
financial standing and probable interest of audience 
that the book publisher must consider. What 's 
the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five 
hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of 
that number didn't know there was that much 
money in the world, and would n't spend it for 
books if they had it to spare ? " 



I N ADVERTISING in The Dial the 
publisher wastes no ammunition, — 
every bird in the flock is a canvas- 
back. The Dial is devoted exclusively 
to books — its readers are exclusively 
buyers of books. Several thousand 
well-to-do people — private readers, 
librarians, booksellers— read The Dial 
regularly, and depend wholly upon its 
guidance in making book purchases. 



T^HESE people, the cream of the

OBSERVATIO NS A BOUT OPERA. 

The operatic situation as it exists in this 
country is about to enter upon a new phase, in 
consequence of the retirement of Mr. Oscar 
Hammerstein from the field and the consolida- 
tion of interests recently engineered by Herr 
Andreas Dippel. The competition of the last 
four years between Mr. Hammerstein's forces 
and those controlled by the Metropolitan Com- 
pany has had both good and bad consequences. 
On the credit side of the balance we have the 
spurring of effort which has revolutionized stage 
management, which has made it possible to pro- 
duce German, French, and Italian works, chorus 
and all, in the languages in which they were 
written, and which has enlarged the old routine 
repertoire by the introduction of many modern 
productions. But on the debit side there has 
been the frantic bidding of one company against 
the other for individual singers, and a general 
recklessness of extravagance which would long 
before this have spelled bankruptcy for ordinary 
purses. The rivalry between the two organiza- 
tions has been conducted upon " sporting " lines, 
and the public has benefitted in a very notice- 
able way. At the close of his last performance 
this year, Mr. Hammerstein addressed the audi- 
ence in these words : 

"This season has been a most unfortunate one 
financially. New York has been flooded with opera, 
and as a consequence the losses have been enormous. 
But 1 have at least the satisfaction of knowing that, 
large as my losses have been, those of the other house 
have been still larger. But I assure you that my efforts 
will not relax. I will be in the field as long as you 
aid me." 

Since these brave words were spoken, Mr. 
Hammerstein has seen a great light and with- 
drawn from the cut-throat competition. The 
light radiated from an offer made him by the 
Metropolitan Company, placed by rumor at the 
figure of two millions, and probably sufficient, 
in any case, to recoup him for his losses. Thus 
he quits the game with full sporting honors, and 
with a salve to soothe the irritation of the 
inflamed pocket nerve. 

Hard following upon the retirement of this 
Prince Rupert of an impresario, comes the 
announcement of a friendly split in the Metro- 
politan management whereby Herr Dippel be- 
comes the director of a new organization which 



344 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



will give opera in Chicago and Philadelphia — 
a season of ten or twelve weeks in each city. 
This organization is to have its own conductors, 
singers, choruses, and orchestra, and will be the 
equal of the Metropolitan Company in all artistic 
respects. Moreover, it will maintain amicable 
relations with New York (and with Mr. Russell's 
Boston organization), which will make possible 
an interchange of all the more important singers 
as occasion arises. Since both Chicago and 
Philadelphia already have magnificent opera- 
houses, the success of the new arrangement is 
much less problematical than would otherwise 
be the case. The new company is an Illinois 
corporation, and is financed in Chicago and 
New York, but the former city has the majority 
interest, and thus becomes the headquarters of 
the enterprise. 

The outcome of this new turn of the kaleido- 
scope is that opera on the grand scale will be 
given next year in only the four cities of New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston ; for 
it is a part of the understanding that neither of 
the companies shall make even short engage- 
ments in other cities. This is hard on the other 
cities, but in the present stage of the general 
operatic situation it is probably a wise decision. 
We have no idea that it will be the permanent 
solution of the problem ; nor should it be, in our 
opinion. But just now it is distinctly matter 
for congratulation that these four operatic foci 
should be henceforth assured for the American 
public. Another advantage is found in the 
elimination of that competition of which the 
great singers have been so quick to take advan- 
tage, and which has made operatic production 
of late years so needlessly expensive. It will 
always remain the most costly form of public 
entertainment ; but its cost may now be kept 
within some sort of reasonable bounds. All 
this smacks a little of the trust methods that 
the public looks upon as reprehensible, for the 
new organization is earmarked by the limitation 
of output and the suppression of competition 
which are popularly thought to be the wicked 
devices of greedy monopolists. But we should 
say, on the whole, that the artists were the 
monopolists here concerned, and that we were 
dealing with a benevolent trust actuated by pub- 
lic-spirited considerations. We do not imagine 
for a moment that the men who are assuming 
the risks (and the risks are certainly real ones) 
have any idea of making money, or that their 
plans are dictated by selfish motives. We should 
think it safe to say that the utmost for which 
they hope is to come out even at the end of the 



year, and that their paramount desire is to serve 
the interests of art and contribute to the devel- 
opment of the sense of beauty. 

The interest of the new enterprise is f ocussed 
in Chicago, because it is based upon the initia- 
tive of a group of Chicagoans, and because it 
will add a greatly-needed element to the aesthetic 
life of this city. Opera has hitherto had in Chi- 
cago only a sporadic and precarious existence. 
There has never been a permanent organization 
on a large scale, and we have had to be content 
with brief visits from Eastern companies, usually 
made at the fag-end of the season, with depleted 
forces and under a conscienceless management. 
We have had to put up with all sorts of make- 
shifts, from the early days of Strakosch and 
Mapleson to the later days of Grau and Conried. 
To get off as cheaply as possible, without making 
the inadequacy of the performances too glaring, 
has until very recently been the actuating prin- 
ciple of the management in its dealings with this 
city. We have been regaled with scrub orches- 
tras, hastily recruited from the ranks of local 
musicians, with ragged and decrepit choruses, 
singing cheerfully in Italian to the German or 
French of the principals, with a stage-manage- 
ment often so slovenly as to be beneath critical 
contempt, and with productions brutally mangled 
as to text, sometimes even mutilated to the extent 
of excising an entire act. And of this precious 
sort of entertainment we have had in some years 
two weeks, in some years a single week, and in 
some years none at all. Only this year and the 
last have we had productions well-oppointed in 
all the essential respects, and been given the 
privilege of witnessing performances that could 
hardly be matched elsewhere in the world. 

This leads us to the final topic of our observa- 
tions about opera — to the sordid but unavoidable 
topic of dollars and cents. Chicago is fortunate 
in possessing the most commodious opera-house 
in the United States. Its erection was a public- 
spirited enterprise, and one of its chief objects, 
as loudly proclaimed when the house was built 
nearly twenty years ago, was to make possible 
the production of opera at a schedule running 
up to three dollars for the best seats. This 
schedule would correspond, considering the 
respective capacities thus brought into compari- 
son, with the five-dollar maximum schedule of 
the Eastern houses. The pledge thus tacitly 
given to the public was observed for more than 
ten years ; then the prices were raised until the 
five-dollar schedule came to prevail. By keep- 
ing Chicago on short commons of a week or two 
a year (with an occasional year of fasting), the

plan was made to work — some of the time, at 
least. Last year a two weeks' season on these 
terms was extraordinarily successful; this year 
a four weeks' season was attempted, and has 
resulted in a heavy deficit. On some evenings 
the house was filled ; on others (and more of 
them) it was less than half-filled. 

The moral of these facts, when applied to next 
year's contemplated season of ten or twelve 
weeks, is plain enough. We have followed the 
history of opera in Chicago pretty closely for 
the past thirty-five years, and there is no con- 
clusion we feel safer in drawing than that which 
affirms the impossibility of making opera pay 
in this city upon a five-dollar schedule. We 
consider it as nearly certain as anything can be, 
that such a scale of prices will prove disastrous ; 
and yet we are given to understand that this 
scale is likely to be put into effect. That a scale 
materially lower will result in larger gross 
receipts, is to us a foregone conclusion ; and it 
is at least demonstrable that a scale with a three- 
dollar maximum would, if it kept the house 
filled, be ample to provide for the expenses of 
the projected organization. The sanguine expec- 
tations that now seem to prevail among the men 
responsible for our new departure in things 
operatic are seriously threatening the goose 
(which is the dear public) that alone can lay 
the golden eggs of their desire. 



CASUA L COM MENT. 

How Mark Twain grappled with the riddle 
of the ages, the insoluble problem of necessity 
and free-will, may be seen by the curious in a little 
privately-printed book from the humorist's pen, 
entitled "What is Man?" which was printed four 
years ago, it is said, with no name of author or 
printer on the title-page. The little volume was in 
the writer's mind for about twenty years, he con- 
fesses, before it took material form in manuscript; 
and then seven more years passed before it was 
printed, every sentence and every word of it being 
pondered deeply by the author in the mean time. 
But all this meditation has failed to produce any 
results of significance. That veritable Sphinx's 
riddle which most thoughtful persons early see to be 
unanswerable, and early learn to cease puzzling over, 
as a snare and a menace to all sanity of mind and 
resoluteness of purpose, is thus tritely treated by 
our would-be philosopher after his twenty years of 
thought : " It is a desolating doctrine ; it is not inspir- 
ing, enthusing, uplifting. It takes the glory out 
of man, it takes the pride out of him, it takes the 
heroism out of him, it denies him all personal credit, 
all applause ; it not only degrades him to a machine, 
but allows him no control over the machine ; makes 



a mere coffee mill of him, and neither permits him 
to supply the coffee nor turn the crank, his sole and 
piteously humble function being to grind coarse or 
fine, according to his make, outside impulses doing 
all the rest." From a strictly rationalistic stand- 
point, that is all true enough ; but, like many other 
true things, it lacks novelty. However, the book 
was written for its author rather than for the world 
or for critics. 

The book-rambles of an ex-Presldent, nar- 
rated by the rambler's own pen, with critical com- 
ments and explanatory remarks, contribute not a little 
to the interest of his recent journalistic utterances. It 
seems that the original " Pigskin Library," already 
referred to in these columns, became considerably 
enlarged by accessions as its owner felt their need 
in the intervals of his combats with wild beasts in 
Africa. Fact and fiction, science and sentiment, 
history and philosophy, all have their place in this 
now famous Library, — attesting Mr. Roosevelt's 
sincerity in his assertion that too much heavy reading 
is quite as bad as too much light reading. Among 
other passing observations is his declared opinion that 
Dumas, in his novels dealing with the French Revolu- 
tion, is a decidedly better historian than Carlyle in 
his famous chronicle. " I have certainly profited as 
much," he asserts, "by reading good and interesting 
novels and stories as by reading anything else, and 
from the contemporary ones I have often reached, 
as in no other way I could have reached, an under- 
standing of how real people feel in certain country 
districts, and in certain regions of great cities like 
Chicago and New York." His good sense is reflected 
in his declaration that there is no such thing as the 
hundred best books or a five-foot shelf of the best lit- 
erature, for there are thousands of best books vary- 
ing in value for different readers. Concerning such 
selections of representative works or parts of works, 
he doubts "whether there is much good in this 
1 tidbit ' style of literature." Yet some of the things 
that seem but tidbits to his Gargantuan appetite 
may afford no mean repast for others at the literary 
banquet-board. 

The increasing vogue of the roof-garden 
reading-room is apparent from a contemplation of 
the thriving and well-frequented aerial apartments 
of this sort now in use in New York and soon to be 
at the high-tide of their summer popularity. No 
fewer than five of the branches of the New York 
Public Library are equipped with roof-garden 
reading-rooms, of which the New York " Times " 
has something of interest to record. " The branch 
on Rivington Street," it says, "first opened one of 
these outdoor reading-rooms in 1905. In that first 
summer nearly 7500 readers gladly escaped from 
the unbearable heat of the reference room and did 
their reading on the roof. Since then new buildings 
have been planned with this feature. These out- 
door reading-rooms are planned for both afternoon 
and evening use. There will be awnings over the top 
to shield from sun and occasional showers; tables

around which the readers can congregate, and a 
network of electric hulbs strung over the top so that 
there will be plenty of light for the industrious who 
wish to study. The Rivington Street roof, the model 
for these later and larger ones, has proved almost 
unbelievably popular. During the five and one-half 
months it was open last summer, from May to Octo- 
ber 12, no less than 28,586 persons sat around the 
tables in the little square space. The largest assem- 
blage for a single month was in July, when 8246 
people took their books up there. The Hamilton 
Fish Park Library roof, which opened for the first 
time last summer, had a patronage of over 16,000 
for its first season, with 6152 readers during the 
month of September alone." The excellent pioneer 
work in this field performed by Mr. Lummis at 
Los Angeles should not be forgotten. 

Miss Jane Addams's stoby of her vocation, 
which is appearing serially in " The American 
Magazine " under the title, "Twenty Years at Hull 
House," appeals irresistibly to lovers of the best in 
autobiography. Like Mr. Booker Washington's and 
Mr. Jacob Riis's own stories, it is the modest and 
straightforward account of worthy achievement in 
earnest and loving labor for one's fellow-creatures. 
Her home life in a little Illinois town, her education 
and spiritual quickening at Rockford College, which 
represented "one of the earliest efforts for woman's 
higher education in the Mississippi Valley, reflecting 
much of the missionary spirit of pioneer Mt. Hol- 
yoke," her sturdy resistance there against the pres- 
sure of a narrow denominationalism, her subsequent 
choice of medicine as a profession and the poor as 
her patients, her enforced relinquishment of this 
plan because of illness, and her travel experiences in 
Europe, where a visit to East London and its scenes 
of poverty strengthened her purpose to devote her 
energies to the amelioration of the condition of the 
masses — all this is related in full and absorbing 
detail. Incidentally she recalls a visit of Bronson 
Alcott's to Rockford College, whose pupils were eager 
to render some service to the father of her who wrote 
" Little Women." But Miss Addams was interested 
rather in the friend and associate of Emerson, and 
she remembers " cleaning the clay of the unpaved 
street off his heavy cloth overshoes in a state of 
ecstatic energy." These recollections deserve, and 
probably will have, republication in book form. 

Some maxims of Pudd'nhead Wilson, that later 
creation of Mark Twain's humorous fancy, deserve 
immortality. For droll association of incongruous 
ideas, and for shrewd insight into weak human 
nature, they are admirable. For example : " The 
holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady 
and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last 
through a lifetime, if not asked to lend money." 
" ' Classic' A book which people praise and do n't 
read." " The man with a new idea is a crank until 
the idea succeeds." " Truth is stranger than fiction, 
but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possi- 



bilities ; truth is n't." " Few things are harder to put 
up with than the annoyance of a good example." 
" It were not best that we should all think alike ; it 
is difference of opinion that makes horse-races." 
"The English are mentioned in the Bible: 'Blessed 
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.'" 
"April 1. This is the day upon which we are re- 
minded of what we are on the other three hundred 
and sixty-four." " Why is it that we rejoice at a 
birth and grieve at a funeral ? It is because we are 
not the person involved." " A cauliflower is nothing 
but a cabbage with a college education." What 
additional gems of wit and wisdom the world is yet 
to enjoy in that sealed (though already partly pub- 
lished) Autobiography, we that are now living shall 
never know, if the author's purpose of having the 
manuscript released only after a century has passed, 
is executed. 

Poetic genius and practical efficiency do 
not necessarily war against each other. Current 
reports from Roumania picture to us the poet-queen, 
who is known in the world of letters as Carmen 
Sylva, as one of the ablest business women of her 
time. It is her judicious development and adver- 
tising of the talent and the resources of her country 
that, together with her own fame as a poet, have 
made little Roumania one of the best-known and 
most prosperous of the smaller European kingdoms. 
Embroidery, the silk industry, and various manu- 
factures crushed out under the Turkish yoke, she 
has revived and made a source of wealth and pros- 
perity to her people, thus proving herself possessed 
of shrewd practical abilities commonly regarded as 
at the opposite pole from poetic inspiration and 
a devotion to the ideal. But, as Dr. Washington 
Gladden remarks in his late volume of reminiscences, 
in a passage touching on the life and character of 
his college mate, the eminently successful editor of 
" Harper's Magazine," a few years' dreaming of 
dreams and absorption in ideals constitute not the 
worst of preparations for noble and effective work in 
the world of the prosaic here and now. Dr. Mar- 
tineau could descend with ease and grace from the 
preparation of a lecture on Spinoza's philosophy to 
the repair of a broken shutter on his study window. 
There is something appropriate and satisfying in this 
inclusion of the less by the greater, this efficiency in 
small matters exhibited by men and women devoted 
to the large things of life. 

A RECORD-BREAKING BOOK-THIEF was not long 

ago arrested in New York in the act of offering 
stolen library books for sale, but by jumping his bail 
of two thousand dollars he has escaped the penalty 
imposed by law. The current annual report of 
the Brooklyn Public Library records losses, for the 
year 1909, of 6131 volumes that have disappeared 
from the shelves, and 2356 volumes that were lost 
by borrowers and not paid for. Figures like these 
tend to destroy confidence in one's fellow library- 
frequenters; but there is a morsel of comfort, how-

THE DIAL

ever bitter its flavor, in the fact that not the Brooklyn 
public in general, but one professional thief in 
particular, and his accomplices, are responsible for 
a great part of these disappearances. An exami- 
nation of the books recovered proves that the mis- 
creant is an expert, and that his field of operation 
has been of considerable extent, embracing nearly 
all of Greater New York. The skilful obliteration 
of marks of ownership was one of his specialties, 
and he also took elaborate pains to secure one per- 
fect copy of a valuable book by destroying perhaps 
half a dozen in the process. That so accomplished 
a villain should still be at large is cause for anxiety 
and alarm to public librarians. 

• • • 

The library and the country parson have, 
in New England, been brought into relations exceed- 
ingly helpful to the parson through the liberal policy 
pursued by the General Theological Library, which 
has its home in Mt. Vernon Street, Boston. At the 
recent semi-centennial celebration of the founding of 
this library, addresses were made by Dr. George A. 
Gordon, Rev. Paul Revere Frothingham, and other 
clergymen of note, their remarks bearing on ''the 
vital importance to the preacher of familiarity with 
modern thought, and the significance of the service 
rendered by the library to New England clergy- 
men." The generosity of one of the directors of 
the General Theological Library has made it possi- 
ble for distant users of the library to borrow and 
return books without expense to themselves for car- 
riage, the postage being paid out of a fund estab- 
lished for the purpose. No fewer than twelve hun- 
dred clergymen, in different parts of New England, 
are now enjoying this privilege. The library is 
well equipped, especially in recent important works 
of interest to its readers, and is undoubtedly doing 
excellent service in rendering backwoods theology a 
thing of the past in the erstwhile haunts of stiff- 
necked puritanism. • • • 

Trusts as material for fiction have by many 
American novelists and story-writers been skilfully 
and profitably used ; and now the French littirateur, 
M. Paul Adam, issues a ponderous work of the im- 
agination entitled Le Trust, on which he has been at 
work almost six years, or from the time of his visit 
to this country as Commissioner of the World's Fair 
at St. Louis. The book is said to contain scores of 
characters, of many nationalities, and of all sorts 
and conditions, long-winded descriptions of scenery 
in all parts of the world, elaborate disquisitions on all 
the sciences and 'ologies, and solid pages of turgid 
rhetoric — with here and there a passage of excellent 
and smoothly-flowing prose. Whatever its value as 
an essay on the iniquities of capitalists and the wily 
ways of corporate greed, as a novel it can hardly 
hope for a great popularity. Will any English or 
American publisher have the courage to bring it out 
in translation ? The scene of the story being laid in 
New York, Cuba, the Alleghenies, Paris, Dauphiny, 
and Egypt, the book in some respects appeals to a 
cosmopolitan public. 



The ramification of a great public library 
is interestingly illustrated in Brooklyn, where this 
branching process has now resulted in twenty-seven 
subsidiary libraries or " branches," four " stations," 
and two " deposit stations," with a prospect in the 
near future of two additional Carnegie branches and 
five stations. To help the dwellers in this favored 
city to find their way to the nearest public storehouse 
of literature, permission has been obtained from the 
proper authorities to place in the stations of the ele- 
vated railroads placards showing the location of all 
these branch libraries. This is indeed bringing the 
books to the people, and should effect much in pro- 
moting the "library habit"; but the true lover of 
the public library and its unimagined richness of 
accumulated treasures will always prefer to seek the 
fountain-head, the central library, rather than draw 
on the necessarily slender resources of branch or 
station, or even draw through the branch or station 
from the great central repository. Applications for 
the latest novel can, of course, just as well be made 
( usually without success) at the branch or the station. 

• • • 

The European demand for the books of 
Colonel Roosevelt has naturally received an 
enormous stimulus from the distinguished author's 
visit in person. Fashionable London, hoping to meet 
him at dinners and receptions, has been clamoring 
for his " best book," and has been reading him up 
in that scrambling fashion known to all who have 
ever prepared themselves at the last moment to meet 
some literary lion from abroad. That sort of read- 
ing, so different from the leisurely enjoyment of " a 
book of verses underneath a bough," is effective in 
its way, and at least diminishes the chances that 
one will compliment Mr. Thomas Hardy on the fine 
character-study in " Fenwick's Career," or ask Mr. 
Bernard Shaw when he is going to write some more 
"Barrack-Room Ballads." And the practice has 
this advantage for the visiting lion, — that it helps 
on the sale of his books, creating a kind of tidal 
wave that precedes his own advent to foreign shores. 

Mrs. Humphry Ward as seen through 
French eyes is pictured in the " Revue des Deux 
Mondes" by M. Firmin Roz, and thus enjoys a 
distinction accorded to many contemporary English 
and American writers by the generously appreciative 
directors of that excellent magazine. Mrs. Ward is 
ranked as one might have expected, with such illus- 
trious English women novelists of the past as George 
Eliot and the Bronte sisters. She gives us what is 
best worth depicting in English society to-day, says 
the French reviewer, who names " Lady Rose's 
Daughter " as an instance of its author's best work, 
thoroughly English in its tone and portraying in 
lifelike manner the aristocracy of England — for 
which, by the way, and for the politics of England, 
Mrs. Ward cherishes something like a passion, as 
many a somewhat wearisome page of her stories 
convincingly testifies.

A Pioxeer Woman Educator.* 



Mary Lyon was by no means the first Amer- 
ican woman to espouse the cause of advanced 
education for her sex — Miss Catherine Beecher 
at Hartford and Miss Zilpah P. Grant at Ips- 
wich, as well as others, having gone before and 
prepared the way for her larger undertakings 
and achievements. From the two above-named 
women — especially from Miss Grant, who be- 
came better known to many as Mrs. Banister, 
and whom she assisted in the principalship of 
the Ipswich school — the future founder of Mt. 
Holyoke Female Seminary drew much of her 
early inspiration as a pioneer educator of young 
women. The story of that eminently successful 
pioneering is now for the first time told in as 
full detail as possible by Miss Beth Bradford 
Gilchrist, a Mt. Holyoke graduate, who is evi- 
dently imbued with the Mary Lyon enthusiasm 
for woman's higher education, and is also filled 
with the sincerest admiration for Mary Lyon 
herself. Miss Gilchrist's " Life of Mary Lyon " 
has for its documentary sources " all known 
manuscripts bearing intimately or remotely on 
Miss Lyon's life," and its preparation was 
prompted by "a request made several years 
ago by President Woolley, voicing a demand 
that has been gathering force through more 
than thirty years." 

Mary Lyon was born in the little hill-town 
of Buckland, in western Massachusetts, where 
the poor rock-ribbed farms are all tilted heaven- 
ward as if in perpetual admonition to their toil- 
worn owners to look on high for those richer 
satisfactions that are certainly not to be wrung 
from the thin and unfertile soil of the New 
England hillsides. February 28, 1797, was the 
day of her birth, and she was the fifth of seven 
children, all girls but one. When the father of 
this rapidly increasing family died, the problem 
of support for the widow and her little ones 
became a serious one ; but Mrs. Lyon was a 
mother in all respects worthy of her famous 
daughter, and her energetic and resourceful 
administration of the little farm and the father- 
less home must have been a useful lesson in thrift 
and contrivance to Mary. It was "on the whole " 
(Mary Lyon's favorite phrase) the best of disci- 
plines for her who was to rear, with the slender 
means available in that region, a lasting monu-

ment to its love of learning and its high esteem 
for the things of the spirit. As the writer 
well says, — 

" Only in Old New England could it have mattered 
so little to be poor. There the world gave a chance at 
competence, instead of wealth. Money was not highly 
esteemed; people had little of it, perhaps because they 
had for it few uses. America was young, and money 
is seldom reckoned among the chief assets of youth. 
Unsmothered by things, minds had plenty of room in 
which to work. Education was the badge of the only 
aristocracy recognized; at the head of the intellectual 
hierarchy stood the minister, a college-bred man. The 
phrase carried a rare and high significance." 

The satisfying of Mary Lyon's eager thirst 
for knowledge was necessarily accomplished with 
difficulty, and in fitful spurts of progress inter- 
rupted by wearisome halts and delays. Money 
had first to be earned for a term of attendance 
at some academy or seminary, and then, panting 
with desire at sight of the fair domains of learn- 
ing just coming in view on the horizon, the 
scholar was forced to pause and consider once 
more the prosaic question of ways and means. 
But whenever opportunity offered she grasped 
it with both hands. At Sanderson Academy in 
Ashfield, a school and town since become asso- 
ciated with other famous names beside hers, 
she was assigned, one Friday night, a lesson in 
Adams's Latin Grammar. It was a new study 
to her, but between Friday and Monday she com- 
mitted to memory practically the whole book, 
and amazed both the teacher and the listening 
scholars as she recited page after page at the 
afternoon session while the sun went down 
behind the western hills and the school forgot 
the meaning of "four o'clock." She afterward 
confessed that she had studied all Sunday, and 
it is not recorded that she was censured for it. 

Teaching alternated with learning in Mary 
Lyon's educational development, and it will 
perhaps comfort some young and temporarily 
disheartened instructors to read that her first 
attempts were by no means great pedagogic 
triumphs. She is even discovered weeping bit- 
terly and vowing never to teach another day. 
" Government," which meant so much in the 
country school of old time, and which is still so 
immensely significant, was the rock on which 
she nearly suffered shipwreck. Her spirits were 
too high, her love of fun too intense, to give her 
at first the calm dignity and quiet command of 
the thoroughly successful teacher. Indeed, her 
merriment of disposition seems to have been a 
lifelong source of trouble to her in the class- 
room, but a fault that her devoted pupils were 
more than glad to pardon in her. Experience

in Miss Grant's school, first at Derry, New 
Hampshire, and then at Ipswich, Mass., ripened 
her powers for the great undertaking of her life, 
the founding and organizing and management 
of the seminary at South Hadley which has 
since developed into Mt. Holyoke College. The 
raising of the funds necessary for even a modest 
beginning was a task to discourage a heart less 
stout than Mary Lyon's. In a passage describ- 
ing the situation, we read : 

" If she dreamed dreams, these hard-headed men 
and women, wringing meagre livings from rocky hill- 
sides, understood very well that nothing is more real 
than the stuff that dreams are made of. Their sons 
grew up to be editors, statesmen, preachers, presidents 
of colleges. They would give their daughters a chance, 
toft Miss Lyon made a business proposition, and they 
took her record as security, looking to her to get their 
money's worth. One daughterless man, tilling a farm 
not over-fertile and with five sons to educate, gave her 
a hundred dollars. Two spinster sisters living in the 
slender comfort of their time signed each for the same 
sum ; soon afterwards they lost their property, but rather 
than be denied the pleasure of fulfilling their pledges 
they earned the money with their own hands. Of such 
gifts was Mount Holyoke built." 

On the rich she could not count with this cer- 
tainty for sympathy and aid in her great work. 
Of one wealthy family from whom she had con- 
fidently expected a handsome contribution, she 
finally had to confess : 

" ' Yes, it is all true, just as I was told. They live in 
a costly house, it is full of costly things, they wear 
costly clothes ' — then drawing nearer and almost clos- 
ing her eyes, she whispered with unforgettable empha- 
sis, ' But oh, they 're little bits of folks ! ' " 

The charter for Mt. Holyoke Female Semi- 
nary was granted in 1836, and the factory-like 
building that first housed the school was opened 
and recitations began in the autumn of 1837. 
From that date to the spring of 1849, when she 
died. Miss Lyon was the life and soul of the 
institution her hands and brain had created. 
The story of her work there, of her methods, of 
the rare qualities of mind and heart for which 
her pupils admired and loved her in her life- 
time and remembered her long after her death, 
is all excellently told by Miss Gilchrist, who has 
drawn to the full on the personal recollections 
of Miss Lyon's now diminished company of her 
former pupils and intimate friends. A word of 
hers, or a trait of character, may be transferred 
here from those rich pages ; but the book must 
be read as a whole to get any adequate concep- 
tion of Mary Lyon's strong and original person- 
ality. M Sometimes I almost fear that we shall 
read our minds away," we find her saying in 
her early teaching days, " with a perpetual suc- 



cession of books of mushroom growth." TVhat 
would have been her alarm in this respect had 
she survived to the present time ! The follow- 
ing homely incident is rich in significance : 

" Her speech was the more effective because she never 
used words when an action would do instead. Deeds in 
her hands served the same meaning purpose as stories 
in the mouth of Lincoln, and like him she never broke 
their force by making the application. Entertaining 
anecdotes are told to show the masterly skill with which 
Miss Lyon wielded this kind of suggestion. One deals 
with incipient graft. A clever pie-circle conceived the 
satisfying idea of lessening the amount put into each pie 
an unnoticeable degree so as to provide an extra one for 
their own eating. Nobody, so far as they knew, was 
aware of the expedient, until one day each girl in the 
circle received an invitation to come to Miss Lyon's room. 
Presenting themselves in her parlor at the appointed 
hour, they found on the table a thick, luscious pumpkin 
pie, which their hostess cordially served to her enlight- 
ened and shame-faced guests." 

A sentence from her lips describing her school 
is worth quoting. " This institution is a great 
intellectual and moral machine," she declared 
to her girls, " and if you will jump in you may 
ride very fast." 

From the Bibliography appended to Miss 
Gilchrist's book it appears, as might have been 
expected, that Mary Lyon was not one to court 
publicity in print. She wrote hardly anything 
for publication. Books and articles about her, 
too, have not been many, which makes the pre- 
sent biography the more welcome. Its two por- 
traits of Miss Lyon and its views of the Seminary 
at different dates, with other appropriate illus- 
trations, are all of interest. It is a biography 
to place beside that of Alice Freeman Palmer ; 
the same intelligent zeal and loving sympathy 
have gone to the making of both.

Two Heroes of Moderx Italy.* 



The history of Italian Union is the history 
of four men : Mazzini the agitator, Garibaldi 
the fighter, Cavour the organizer, and Victor 
Emmanuel the ruler. Chance has placed in our 
hands at one and the same time a biography of 
the agitator, and one of the popular champion; 
for Madame Mario's history holds Mazzini con- 
stantly in the foreground, and Air. Trevelyan

aid of which we have a fairly complete life of 
Garibaldi. 

In the opinion of Mr. Trevelyan, the time is 
ripe for a profitable study of the period. " Fif- 
teen years ago there was not enough printed 
matter and MS. available, and fifteen years 
hence there will be nothing left except these 
printed sources. But oral witness has its his- 
torical value," as both books prove very conclu- 
sively. Their tone, method, and viewpoint are 
of course widely different. Madame Mario, 
born of English and American parentage in 
1832, but married in 1857 to Mazzini's sup- 
porter Alberto Mario, and herself devoted heart 
and soul to the cause of Italian Republicanism 
— giving her life to it, in fact, as nurse, writer, 
lecturer, teacher, organizer — is telling the terri- 
bly serious story of her own experiences, and, with 
all her generosity and breadth of sympathies, 
is telling it as a partisan. Mr. Trevelyan, his- 
torian of another generation, writing without 
bias and with only a scholar's interest, is more 
objective, more reliable, more enamored of lit- 
erary effect ; but there is something in a story 
of action and suffering, when told by one who 
has acted and suffered, that takes effect as no 
scholar's compilation can do. 

Madame Mario had made the acquaintance of 
Garibaldi on a visit to Italy in 1854 ; she had 
at once become not merely his devoted admirer 
but his very intimate friend, and had somewhat 
later taken charge of his then invalid son, Ric- 
ciotti, had seen him almost completely cured in 
England, and sent him back to fight bravely for 
his native land in half a dozen wars. Garibaldi's 
affection for his " sisters in the faith " seems to 
Anglo-Saxons a trifle exaggerated, and in one 
case at least an effusive letter to a " sister" was 
interpreted as a proposal of marriage, to the 
unbounded astonishment of the innocent author. 
As a matter of fact, there is no question that in 
such relations, as in all others, Garibaldi was 
one of the most scrupulously honorable of men. 
During a visit to England, some years after the 
death of his brave wife Anita, he won the heart 
of a lady of means and family ; but learning that 
her son was opposed to the union and that his 
motives might be misconstrued if he married 
her, he abruptly broke off relations with her, 
though in so doing he did violence to both inter- 
est and inclination. It is true that in this case 
the feelings of the lady herself might have had 
more weight with him than they seem to have 
carried ; but the gallant though blundering 
Ligurian was actuated only by generous motives, 
whatever the result of his actions may have been. 



It is in the pages of Trevelyan that we see this 
modern hero of romance at his best. Garibaldi's 
exploits in Sicily rank with those of Wallace in 
Scotland, of Tell in Switzerland, of Joan of Arc 
in France, — with the difference that Garibaldi's 
deeds are well-attested and are ours to study in 
detail. And with all his magnetic personality, his 
absolute fearlessness, his irresistible enthusiasm, 
his was the most lovable, the most generous, the 
most innocent, the most childish nature imagin- 
able. While living in the Island of Caprera, 
he learned one night that a new-born lamb had 
been lost among the rocks. A long search by 
lantern-light failed to find it. In the words of 
one of his friends, — 

" It was nine o'clock, and raining, and we were very- 
tired; so we once more returned to the house, and went 
to bed. An hour afterward we heard the sound of 
footsteps in the next room, and the house-door opened. 
. . . About midnight we were roused by a voice ; it was 
the hero returning, joyfully carrying the lost lamb in 
his arms. He took the little creature to his bed, and 
lay down with it, giving it a bit of sponge dipped in 
milk to keep it quiet . . . and he spent the whole night 
caressing and feeding the foolish creature." 

Contrast this incident with the act of the Mon- 
tefusco jailer who killed a nightingale because 
its songs were comforting the apostles of Italian 
liberty whom he held as prisoners, and the con- 
trast gives some idea of the difference between 
the generous enthusiasm that animated the 
patriots and the bitter hatred which that enthu- 
siasm aroused in the breasts of their Austrian 
and Neapolitan oppressors. 

The conquest of Sicily with a thousand men, 
when Palermo alone held a garrison of twenty 
thousand, was the most remarkable military 
exploit of the century. It may be urged that 
the entire population of the island was aiding 
him ; but the support which the invaders received 
from the Sicilians, aside from moral support, 
seems to have been surprisingly small. There 
is a Sicilian proverb, " Better a pig than a 
soldier "; and even when inspired by the encour- 
agement and example of those brave northern 
Italians who had come so far to risk their lives 
for a principle, the Sicilian's military method 
was generally to await the issue from a respect- 
able distance and come in very enthusiastically 
at the death. The forced evacuation of Palermo 
was a most beautiful game of " bluff," for 
although the urban population aided Garibaldi 
much more effectively than the countrymen had 
done, his ammunition ran short and he could 
scarcely have prolonged the conflict a day longer. 
But the " bluff " succeeded, the Sicilian cam- 
paign was the decisive struggle of the war, and

Garibaldi enjoyed a sort of popular worship 
that has been the lot of few moderns. Venosta 
wrote : 

" When Garibaldi passed through a village, you would 
not have said he was a general, but the head of a new 
religion followed by a crowd of fanatics. The women, 
no less enthusiastic than the men, brought their babies 
to (him) that he should bless and even baptize them." 

And the popular idol never deserved a fall. 
Blundering often and egregiously, a creature 
of wild impulse at times, woefully lacking in 
tact and foresight and thus often harming the 
cause it was his dearest wish to further, he 
remains to the end as pure in motives as a man 
could well be. 

Quite as much can be said for Mazzini, the 
melancholy exile who tasted the infinite bitter- 
ness of laboring that others might reap the 
fruits of his labor, and who died an object of 
aversion to many who were enjoying the liberties 
his sad life had brought them. Patriotism was 
a religion with these men, to a degree that is 
inconceivable to our selfish and materialistic 
generation. There is food for the most search- 
ing thought in Garibaldi's refusal to live in 
America because there a man " acquires a new 
home and forgets his country"; in the martyr- 
dom of Mazzini, a man of affectionate home- 
loving nature, who lived his life alone and in 
exile rather than make the slightest concession 
to an unjust oppressor ; in the refusal of 
Alberto Mario to take the oath of allegiance to 
Victor Emmanuel, and his acceptance of poverty 
and obscurity in preference to place and prefer- 
ment under a government which he disapproved. 
And Mario's attitude suggests the difficulty 
which stood most stubbornly in the way of 
Italian liberty. There was what seemed for a 
long time a hopeless difference of opinion among 
Italians as to the form of government they 
wanted when they should be freed from Austria 
and the local despots. The monarchy under the 
House of Piedmont prevailed through the clever- 
ness and enterprise of Cavour, and many Repub- 
licans, like Garibaldi, suffered a change of views 
and supported it ; but others, like Mazzini and 
Mario, remained Republican to the end, and 
thus suffered with their contemporaries. But 
there is no need for them to suffer with pos- 
terity; our admiration for Cavour, who was 
patriotic and shrewd, need no longer lessen our 
sympathy for Mazzini, whose patriotism burned 
so hotly that shrewdness could not live in the 
same breast with it. 

Anglo-Saxons feel a particular interest in the 
part that England played in the reconstruction 



of Italy. Mr. Trevelyan tells in detail of Glad- 
stone's efforts to arouse the civilized world in 
protest against the treatment of political prison- 
ers by the King of Naples, — efforts which pro- 
duced their effect in spite of the retort of the 
Neapolitan historian De Sivo, who reminded 
" Lord Gladston " that the English, who sold 
their wives with ropes round their necks for a 
few "pences," had no call to complain of the 
" little trials in Naples." Both of the volumes 
before us are full of the doings of the British 
Foreign Secretary, the brave Lord Palmerston, 
and of various indignant English diplomatic 
representatives in Italy ; and Madame Mario's 
pages are strewn with allusions to Mazzini's 
encounters with English and American notables 
during his eighteen years' residence in England. 
Carlyle, grim old Absolutist in theory, was one 
of the lovable little Italian's stanchest friends, 
and his wife was even more cordial, — although 
Mrs. Carlyle, be it said in all reverence, was 
depressingly uncertain, and not always fair to 
him or others. Harriet Martineau — " deaf as a 
post," but " the woman with the broadest views 
and most cultivated intellect" in England — 
was favorably impressed with him and his cause. 
Charles Dickens was his friend and honest 
admirer. The sympathy of the Brownings with 
Italian liberty is too well known to need discus- 
sion, — although Mrs. Browning's admiration 
for Napoleon III. later affected her attitude 
toward Napoleon's bitterest enemy. Rogers, the 
poet, who was frequently Mazzini's host, was, 
according to him, " the first Englishman who 
foretold that there would arise a third Italy." 
Tennyson, who treated Garibaldi with great con- 
sideration on the occasion of his visit to England 
in 1864, seems to have ignored Mazzini, and 
was severely criticized by him for the " insular 
selfishness " displayed in his poems. Margaret 
Fuller, Cobden, the Italian champion in Parlia- 
ment Joseph Stansfield, and a goodly list 
besides, proved that the Anglo-Saxon is capable 
of generous impulses when the liberties of other 
countries are in question. George Sand in 
France and Kossuth in Hungary were Mazzini's 
friends and helpers, — though Kossuth acted 
rather strangely on at least one occasion, and the 
enthusiastic Frenchwoman was more socialist 
than Nationalist.

abruptly with the year 1864, is supplemented by 
an admirably clear and concise little story of the

The Long Path of Light.* 



A fitting treatment of a subject so profound 
as " The Problem of Human Life " calls for 
wide and deep insight, both into the problem 
itself and into the manner in which the leading 
writers in philosophy have regarded it. If phi- 
losophy means anything of moment, it carries 
with it some solution of the problem of life ; 
and the connection of those who have taken a 
prominent position in philosophical discussions 
is to be found in the bearings of their theories 
on the solution of this problem. The book 
before us is a presentation of the view of " great 
thinkers from Plato to the present time," and 
demands, therefore, a mastery of the theme 
itself, and of the way in which the deepest and 
most obscure thought of the world has been 
associated with it. 

The book is made up of three portions, treat- 
ing of Hellenism, Christianity, and the Philo- 
sophical Modern World, giving the great forms 
and eras of belief. It is not at all necessary 
that such a work should conform closely to our 
own conviction, if its insights are far-reaching 
and able to quicken the mind in its apprehensions 
of the bearings of human life. As the volume is 
much too comprehensive for even a brief treat- 
ment of the whole, we will confine ourselves to 
the second part, which treats of Christianity, its 
origin, and its earlier and later forms. The 
first topic embraces the character of Christianity 
and the view of life held by Jesus ; the second 
topic covers the Pre-Augustinian and Augustine 
periods, and the Middle Ages ; the third period 
is that of the Reformation and of the later cen- 
turies. We are to bear in mind that the book is 
not a history of these periods, but a relatively 
brief and sharp discussion of their relation to 
each other and to the general problem of human 
life. This purpose affords illumination, and the 
plan is carried forward with a temper fitting the 
work. The unity of Christianity is not found in 
its origin, itself affected and narrowed by special 
conditions ; nor yet in an historical sequence 
which at every stage came under changing cir- 
cumstances and was modified or turned aside by 
them, but in a distinctive primary purpose which 
went everywhere with it as its inner power. It 
was a religion of salvation. It grew into and 
out of existing conditions, but always in refer- 
ence to their improvement and development. 

* The Problem of Human Life. By Professor Rudolph 
Eucken, of the University of Jena. Translated by William 
S. Hough, of Washington University, and W. R. Boyce 
Gibson, of the University of London. New York : Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 



This salvation was not of a physical, ontological 
sort, but ethical in its character. It was to be 
built up out of, and founded upon, the existing 
qualities of the world; but it was to owe its 
form and power to a peculiar sense of the near- 
ness of the divine life to human life. The pre- 
sence of God in the world created new thought 
and affections, in whose activity all other activi- 
ties took on a new direction. The world was a 
place of difficulties and discouragement and fail- 
ures, but one in which the least attainment lay 
in the pathway of the highest success. Religion 
ceased to be an accident or incident of life, and 
became its verj r substance — that without which 
existence sank into worthlessness. Instantly 
there sprang up a new feeling of the unity of 
men, sharing together the divine love and guid- 
ance. The individual could not be enriched 
except by a wealth which came to all. Hence 
arises not simply a return of good and evil in 
endless circuits, — pleasure followed by pain and 
pain by pleasure, — but a history of the world, 
a progress of events under the divine presence 
according to the divine plan. Gains and losses 
alike were brought into one forward movement. 
The mind and heart and active powers were all 
kept alert in the fulfilment of one great pur- 
pose, dear to God and man. 

This conception altered the relation of men 
to suffering. Suffering became a revelation, 
an emphasis placed upon events as they aided 
or thwarted the supreme end of growth. Suf- 
fering united men more closely to God and 
more sympathetically with each other. Yet 
suffering was not to be accepted as an ultimate 
good ; we were to escape it by rising above it, 
by going beyond it, by coming more fully under 
the good. Obedience and life were not plain 
simple things, but things of much complexity 
and confusion. Difficulties were to be encoun- 
tered in new forms, and by means of them we 
were to rise into wider and richer views of the 
divine purpose and the divine love. The mo- 
ment we stopped or accepted any good as ulti- 
mate, the vision of growth began to escape us, 
and we became as other men, with our portion 
in the present only. We lost our divine lead, 
and became subject to the endless tide of vicis- 
situdes. A mighty life-force had been planted 
in us, and only as we became aware of it and 
gave way before it did we become the children 
of God. Life was not made easier by Chris- 
tianity, but rather more difficult. The solu- 
tion was to be wrought out ; the repose lay 
beyond the present, was itself so much of the 
nature of effort that we could never rest upon

it in simple indolence. All our achievements 
were living achievements, and led to others like 
them. Our triumphs were successes in doing 
and being according to the mind of God and 
the spiritual force of the world. Not indolence, 
but successful activity, a revelation constantly 
enlarging within itself, was the goal of Christian 
effort. 

How did Jesus present this vision ? He offers 
it as the Kingdom of Heaven. It is not simply 
an inner transformation, but an external one as 
well. It is an " inseparable union of trust in 
God with love of men." It is a kingdom of spir- 
itual lif e ; a union of men in the goodness and 
mercy of God. Man is not left in anything at 
the sport of physical events. These are all 
gathered up in the watchfulness and protection 
of God. The human grows into the likeness of 
the divine, since it is viewed from the beginning 
as in the presence of the divine. Thus the 
child's nature, subject to all guidance and in- 
struction, is the type of the Christian nature — 
the fitting recipient of apprehension and explan- 
ation. But in this obedience there is no burden 
since it unfolds under the law of love — love 
directed toward God and toward men. The 
ethics of Jesus rest on these divine and human 
relations, and unites them in the highest har- 
mony. It thrusts aside the hypocrisy of the 
Pharisee, which covers up under the law the 
entire brood of personal interests. The follower 
of Christ was to propose to himself the same 
perfection which he found in the fatherhood of 
God. Thus the Kingdom of Heaven — a sim- 
ple, original idea — was revolutionary in its effect 
on human life. It stands in growing collision 
with the world as found in human society, and 
feels increasingly the conflict. The ultimate 
and rapid triumph of the harmony and fulness 
of life over the partial and conflicting interests 
prevalent among men came to seem both assured 
and immediate. 

The spiritual power of a faith is measured by 
the conception of life which is expressed by its 
founder. The image and life of Jesus have 
remained, amid all aberrations, the constant 
centre and revelation of subsequent Christian 
thought. From this starting point, the simple 
spiritual personality of Christ, the author pro- 
ceeds to its speculative enlargement by the early 
church, and later to its intense and compre- 
hensive expression in the life and belief of 
Augustine. 

It is the purpose of this brief notice neither 
to follow this long path of light, nor to estimate 
its revelation. We wish simply to indicate 



the comprehensive and intelligent way in which 
it is pursued, the thoughtfulness with which it 
has been wrought out, and the reward which it 
is sure to bring to those who pursue it in a kin- 
dred temper. Jomf Bascom> 



The Career of ah Amebic ax 
Diplomat.* 



There has been some discussion as to whether 
or not our political system really admits of the 
" diplomatic career," in the meaning given to 
that term by long practice over the water. In 
Mr. Foster's record, one may fairly claim that 
the possibility has been demonstrated, and the 
great value of diplomacy on that plane, as com- 
pared with a service which is made the football 
of domestic politics, has been proved at the same 
time. This, too, in spite of the fact that he 
entered the service by the well-worn political 
route. As Chairman of the Indiana State Re- 
publican Committee, in 1872, he had led his 
party to a triumphant success in the October 
election, which of course had its effect in in- 
creasing the majority of Grant a month later. 
Senator Oliver P. Morton, with his usual assur- 
ance in matters depending on his influence with 
Grant, told the young Chairman to take the 
Federal " Blue Book " and pick out whatever 
office he might want. The Swiss Mission was 
modestly selected ; but for once Senator Morton 
had tripped, for Grant had already assured the 
incumbent of that post of his retention. Instead 
of the " something just as good," however, Mr. 
Foster was overwhelmed by the immediate offer 
of the Mexican Mission. With no foreign lan- 
guage at his command, and no diplomatic expe- 
rience, he frankly informed the Senator that he 
doubted his own ability for such a position, and 
felt inclined to refuse the offer. Morton was 
not impressed, however, and persuaded him to 
accept. With ordinary politicians, that would 
simply have meant a term of ineffective service, 
with a return to politics or business when the 
post was wanted for some other successful cam- 
paigner. But Mr. Foster had in his makeup a 
feeling of moral obligation to do his duty, and 
the deficiencies which he had painfully felt in 
prospect were rapidly removed. The Mexicans 
were soon convinced that the new minister was 
an able, honest, and broad-minded man, from

whom they need fear no attempt at the double- 
dealing by which the profession of diplomacy is 
so often disgraced ; and this conviction was of 
great value during the period of strained rela- 
tions caused by the delay of the Administration 
at Washington in recognizing the validity of 
the revolution led to success by Porfirio Diaz in 
1877. In 1880 Mr. Foster was transferred to 
St. Petersburg, where he remained less than two 
years, as he had concluded that family inter- 
ests demanded his attention. This brief period 
included the assassination of Alexander the 
Second, of which an interesting account is given 
in these memoirs ; also some of the famous state 
trials of the Nihilists — among others, of Sophie 
Perofsky, a woman of aristocratic connections 
and superior education, who had waved the sig- 
nal for the throwing of the bomb by which the 
Emperor was slain. It is told of her that she 
was accustomed to sleep with a hundred pounds 
of dynamite under her bed, in order to be able 
to balk the officers of their prey if she and her 
associates were detected. Sixteen years later, 
Mr. Foster's services were again employed at St. 
Petersburg by the McKinley Administration — 
this time on a special mission in connection with 
the Fur Seal negotiations. 

His determination to return to private life, 
formed in 1881, was reversed two years later at 
the earnest solicitation of President Arthur, who 
recognized his special fitness for the Spanish 
Mission, and for the inauguration of a policy 
of commercial reciprocity with the Spanish- 
American countries upon which the President 
had set his heart. He entered heartily upon 
the scheme for commercial reciprocity, but was 
forced to conclude in the end, after added 
experience under the Harrison and McKinley 
Administrations, that our system of government 
furnishes too many disturbing elements to admit 
of that permanence without which the recip- 
rocity system can be little else than a source 
of irritation in our negotiations with foreign 
countries. 

By special request of the President, Mr. 
Foster remained at Madrid for a time, under 
the Cleveland Administration, and might have 
remained longer but for his own desire to with- 
draw and take up once more the practice of law. 
But his well-known diplomatic abilities were 
destined to interfere with this plan, as before. 
A call to the cabinet of President Harrison as 
Secretary of State, renewed attempts at recip- 
rocity treaties, the Bering Sea Arbitration, 
the Alaskan Boundary Settlement, and the 
Hague Peace Conference, all drew him at dif- 



ferent times into the service of his country, and 
in every case to his own credit and to the pub- 
lic good. 

Most interesting of all, however, are the pages 
which tell of the call received by Mr. Foster 
from the Emperor of China, in the closing 
days of 1894, to act as adviser to the Chinese 
commission which had just been appointed to 
the bitter task of going to Japan to sue for 
peace. It was a notable opportunity, and nobly 
used ; but space will not admit the details of 
the story here. We may only state that his 
thoroughly disinterested service to China, in the 
hour of her humiliation and peril, was indirectly 
one of the best services which it was ever his lot 
to render to his own land. 

In their important contributions to American 
history, these volumes are of the highest value. 
There is not one of the great subjects treated 
on which new light is not thrown ; and when we 
get to the position that young men may inten- 
tionally prepare themselves for diplomatic ser- 
vice with some chance of being actually called 
to it because of such preparation, Mr. Foster's 
volumes will inevitably form an important ele- 
ment in their reading. If space were available, 
we would gladly quote some of his estimates of 
the men with whom his career brought him into 
contact. These are generally kindly, and never 
harsh in tone, — though there are times when 
the lancet goes deep by suggestion, if not by 
direct thrust. For instance, when the desire of 
Marcus A. Hanna to enter the Senate made it 
politically requisite to take John Sherman from 
that body and thrust him, in his old age and 
physical weakness, into the new and difficult 
duties of the office of Secretary of State, we are 
told that this was u an act from which the kindly 
nature of President McKinley doubtless shrank, 
but which he did not feel at liberty to evade." 

Two points in his theory of diplomatic ethics 
are worthy of especial attention and emulation. 
At the outset of his career, in Mexico, Mr. 
Foster found his diplomatic colleagues, almost 
without exception, making investments in Mexi- 
can mines or speculating in mining stocks. For 
himself, he set the rule at once that as a diplo- 
matic representative he should have no interests 
of any kind whatever in the country to which 
he was accredited, and no personal complications 
in the claims of any of his fellow countrymen. 
If all our representatives, especially to the coun- 
tries of this hemisphere, had been equally con- 
scientious in observing the demands of personal 
and national propriety in this matter, our repu- 
tation would have been spared a good many 



1910.]

stains which it now has to carry. The other 
point relates to the attitude of the diplomat to 
home politics. During his mission to Mexico, 
Mr. Foster was persuaded by Senator Morton 
to return temporarily to the United States and 
take part in the electoral contest of 1876. "I 
regard that act," he says, " as one of the most 
serious mistakes of my diplomatic career. A 
diplomatic officer, more than any other, should 
be a non-partisan representative." He also re- 
lates in another chapter an experience of Secre- 
ary Hay. who was persuaded (if that is the word 
to use) by President Roosevelt to make a speech 
in New York City on the eve of the campaign 
of 1904. He remonstrated with the President, 
insisting that the Secretary of State should not 
take part in politics, since it would have a bad 
influence on the Diplomatic Corps, and injure his 
influence with the Senate, which must pass on 
his treaties and policies. To all this, the reply of 
President Roosevelt was that if Secretary Hay 
did not make the speech the election might be 
lost, and he not be Secretary of State the next 
term. We close with a few lines from Mr. 
Foster's own closing paragraph: 

" When, at the close of ray mission to Spain, I re- 
sumed my residence in Washington, I was fifty years of 
age ; and from that date forward I did my most laborious 
and successful work. It seemed as if the earlier portion 
of my life had been merely a preparation for the labor 
which was in store for me, and which proved the most 
useful and important. I have been highly honored by 
my country with many important public trusts, but I 
have the consciousness of having earnestly striven to 
discharge them faithfully."

The Genius of the French.* 



A new book with the title "The French 
Procession : A Pageant of Great Writers," is cer- 
tainly promising ; dedication and a prefatory 
letter to Vernon Lee give almost a pledge of that 
rarest of intellectual treats, a literary causerie; 
the author's name is a guarantee of good work. 
We in America have long known Mary F. Rob- 
inson as a writer whose poetry has a sure though 
narrow appeal ; we know also that as Mrs. James 
Darmesteter her interpretation of French history 
has been scholarly and vivid : now, as Madame 
DuClaux, this Englishwoman with long French 
affiliations is fully equipped to present what she 
calls the " literature of a great nation, in its vast 
succession and continuity, as it passes down the

ers. By Madame Mary DuClaux (A. Mary F. Robinson).

ages." This literature, she says, " appears as a 
spectacle, a progress, a pageant, wherein every 
figure is not only a marvel but the embodiment 
of a whole invisible plexus of secret influences, 
ideas, traditions, and revolts. 1 ' Gladly does the 
reader take a position with the author on her 
balcony, which she calls " the watch-tower of a 
tranquil mind," to look on this pageant — "the 
continuous genius of a people." 

A glance at the table of contents, which 
serves as a telescope to sweep the whole proces- 
sion into our ken, shows the great divisions of the 
progress — "In the Distance," "The Roman- 
tics," " The Sons of Science." The first division 
permits a promiscuous grouping. Here are poet, 
king, scientist, mystic, rebel, in due range. How 
shall we come close to the spirit of the French 
nation, if those we look upon differ so markedly 
in temperament as Fenelon and Voltaire ? We 
listen to the overture to the march in the essay 
on French Poetry, eager for a clue to the line 
of thought we are to busy ourselves with as this 
varied company troops past us. But this over- 
ture, though strong and fine, is found to have 
little relation to what follows. In the entire com- 
pany there are but five poets — Ronsard, Racine, 
Victor Hugo, Alfred De Musset, and Beaude- 
laire, — and these are so distantly scattered in 
the procession as to lack impressiveness. We 
must be satisfied, then, with this essay as a com- 
ment on French Poetry ; for of these five poets 
only Racine is closely described . Some may think 
he is given more than his due ; others may feel 
that Villon is more representative of the early 
modern French spirit than Ronsard, and that 
Paul Verlaine is more typical of later French 
poetry than Beaudelaire. 

Accepting them, however, as chosen, Madame 
DuClaux, in interpreting these poets as part of 
the " continuous genius of the French," shows 
herself to be more of a biographer than critic. 
Victor Hugo will not be made clearer to an 
English reader by the mass of personal detail 
which in nowise explains his poetry. Alfred 
De Musset is enmeshed in his amorous intrigues, 
till the fair soul of the hapless youth seems lost 
in a maze of gossip. Beaudelaire is not keenly 
defined as a decadent ; and being here in the 
rank of the poets, he gains no laurels for his 
beautiful prose. In spite of Madame DuClaux's 
avowal of allegiance to French poetry, there is 
reason to doubt its warmth. True, France has 
no such poets as England ; but the French 
themselves feel no lack in their poetry. From 
infancy they lisp it in the fables of Fontaine ; 
in early youth they are well grounded in the sen-

timent of Lamartine and in the wit of Moliere. 
As for Victor Hugo, he is by acclamation the 
very " genius " of French poetry. But it is just 
this subtle genius we do not get from mere bio- 
graphical data. It is well, after looking at these 
poets, who are far apart in other ways than in this 
procession, to read again Madame DuClaux's 
introductory essay on French Poetry, and thus 
be assured that her feeling for the subject is 
sincere and even noble. 

Not only is the treatment of the poets of the 
pageant unsatisfactory, that of the great prose 
writers of France is even more so ; for it is 
through French prose that English readers may 
best discern the French spirit. Hence one re- 
sents a broad inclusion of minor influences in 
French thought, when these might better give 
way to the originative forces that have given 
French literature, in so many aspects, an 
unquestionable superiority. Voltaire, Balzac, 
Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole France fill large 
places in French literature ; but do they vitally 
cohere without Rabelais and Montaigne ? Here 
was an excellent opportunity to define the 
" continuous genius " of the French people — 
a genius for satire, for urbane discursiveness, 
for social insight, for subduing the whole realm 
of thought and (as with Balzac) of passion, to 
rhythmic order, to stable congruity ; above all, 
a genius for what might be called literary conse- 
cration. Any of this group is typical of this 
one phase of French literary biography — none 
more so than Voltaire ; yet Madame DuClaux 
allows Professor Lanson to say the only vital 
thing about Voltaire, a man in whom meet so 
many tendencies of the French mind — keen- 
ness, criticism, a zeal for human progress even 
when deriding the steps thereto, a passionate 
interest in the things of the mind independent 
of race or religion, a catholic intellectuality. 
Goldsmith's description of him defending En- 
glish literature in a hostile company symbolizes 
Voltaire's attitude toward all literature. His 
impatience of Congreve, for wishing to be 
thought an English gentleman rather than a 
writer of witty comedies, suggests the difference 
between the literary spirit of France and of 
England. The French subordinate life to liter- 
ature ; the English use literature for some gain 
in life. 

Balzac, whose conquest of literature is Napo- 
leonic, whose Comedie Humaine expresses in 
its very title the French genius for social inter- 
pretation, has made but little impression upon 
Madame DuClaux. In this, as in so much of 
her book, she is busied with what is adventitious 



in a man's life, and not with what is essential 
in his art. She admits that Balzac created the 
modern novel, and then denies any meaning in 
this honor by ranking him with Sir Walter 
Scott. The man who saw society and saw it 
whole, who caught the secret of passion as it 
affects life, and of money as a passion, and of 
vocational success as it is thwarted by or rises 
superior to either sex or money, has no affinity 
with Walter Scott. Fortunately, Madame Du 
Claux saves herself from total error in her 
estimate of Balzac by a real appreciation of 
some of his qualities ; but his splendid achieve- 
ment — so all-inclusive, so integrated, so start- 
ling in insight, that his name comes to mean 
life — needs a connotation other than this. So 
too does Balzac's critic enemy, Sainte-Beuve, 
who did for French literature what the novelist 
did for French life — grasped . it entire and 
gave it new meaning, teaching any critic who 
comes after him that he must know not only 
literature but history and philosophy in their 
relation to the individual writer. Madame Du 
Claux is not a vital literary critic, and there- 
fore does not do justice to the greatest of critics. 
She does, however, approach something like 
real critical acumen in her study of Anatole 
France, whom she discriminatingly contrasts 
with Maurice Barr&s in a few large generaliza- 
tions which are worth more as criticism than 
whole pages of intimate gossip. 

Madame DuClaux's interest in French his- 
tory is keen ; her ability to trace the under- 
currents, to point out the depths and shallows 
of its wayward course, is sure. It is only fair 
to give all possible credit to the part of the 
pageant in which men of historical significance 
appear. The placing of Louis Quatorze in 
relation to the spirit of his time is excellent. 
Rousseau has perhaps never been so thoroughly 
presented within the small compass of an essay. 
One may question the right of LaClos and 
Liancourt to be in this august assembly ; but 
being here, they are amply accounted for. The 
interpretation of " The Sons of Science " is also 
illuminating. Whether they are real scientists 
like Fontenelle, or those who, like Ernest Renan 
and Hippolyte Taine, applied a scientific method 
to the study of religion and literature, their part 
in the procession is made brilliant and convinc- 
ing. In fact, there is a tendency throughout 
these discussions to make philosophy and science, 
as developed by the French, their real genius ; 
whereas the genius of the French is distinctively 
literary, and everything else is subordinate to 
this. And because of this literary power

they bear away the palm for movements and 
measures they did not originate. John Locke 
anticipated Rousseau's educational doctrine, 
just as Richardson had anticipated much of 
the sentimentality of " La Xouvelle Heloi'se "; 
but Rousseau alone possessed the magic of 
the winged word to blow his truth about the 
world. He had the power of the angel voice 
to trumpet his message till it toppled the throne 
of kings. German theologians pointed out the 
necessity of Hebrew philology in the history of 
religion before Ernest Renan. They lacked 
Renan's sweet reasonableness in proving this; 
hence Renan is read and the Germans are for- 
gotten. Even Fenelon's lessons to the Due de 
Bourgogne are cast in artistic form. French- 
men, whether scientists, scholars, reformers, or 
critics, are writers above all else, and form is 
the priceless wedding-garment which singles 
them out at the feast of things intellectual. 
The quality of this form is what we should most 
wish to see when all these types are massed as 
a Pageant of Great Writers. But our guide, 
intellectually alert as she is, forgot this in 
attending to much which, though creditable to 
her learning, [is not closely according to her 
initial programme. 

Xo degree of attention to philosophy and sci- 
ence as an expression of the French spirit can 
keep one from looking, as this pageant passes, 
for a persistent element in French history and 
letters — a line of notable women. By the 
promise made of a literary review in the preface, 
Madame de Maintenon has a more legitimate 
right among the choice and master spirits of 
her age than Louis XIV. She had a finer influ- 
ence upon Madame DuClaux's favorite, Racine. 
Madame de Sevigne had a quality of the French 
spirit beautiful to know. By a perverse selec- 
tion, we have a paper on " Goethe in France," 
though the very logic of the subject demands 
that we see how France went well equipped to 
Goethe when Madame de Stael was gathering ma- 
terial for her De V Allemagne. The only woman 
observable from the tower is George Sand, and 
she is so trivially exhibited that her place might 
well have been given to Flaubert, who loved to 
call her master. The enthusiastic Sandist, will 
resent Madame DuClaux's airing of unpleasant 
facts which in no way affect the fine imagina- 
tion of that unique force in literature. There 
are two essays on George Sand, and scarcely a 
word about her literary fecundity, her fine idyllic 
sense, her aptitude for an intellectual comrade- 
ship so helpful to Balzac in his precarious career, 
to Sainte-Beuve's simple life of reading and 



writing, and to Flaubert in his sullen isolation. 
The varied gifts of George Sand should not 
be ignored, even by an Englishwoman. Both 
Elizabeth Barrett and George Eliot were glad 
to acknowledge their indebtedness to her. Lit- 
erature itself has been enriched by her love of 
the picturesque, her large feeling for things 
human, her ease and grace in writing. She 
belongs truly to the French genius. 

And what is this genius ? Is it not a match- 
less sincerity toward art, and toward literature 
as the greatest art? This sincerity is their 
inspiration to an almost superhuman industry 
in acquiring a style adequate to every form of 
expression. Style — that is the gift of the 
French. It is not in their literature alone, but 
in their whole range of life, — in their delicate 
food, their ornate clothing, their fine speech, 
their distinguished manners, their superb capi- 
tal which in itself is a glory of art.

The Xegbo Problem Viewed across 
the Color-line.* 

The American Race-problem is one which 
still interests writers and readers, if one may 
judge from the annual output of books and 
pamphlets about it. Once in a long while a 
book is written which is worth reading ; many 
are useless, or worse. Professor Kelly Miller's 
" Race Adjustment " is well worth reading. 
The author is a negro, born in North Carolina 
during the Civil War ; it is probable that he 
was a slave for two years, although " Who 's 
Who in America " does not enlighten us on that 
point ; for the past twenty years he has been a 
professor in Howard University. He has wit- 
nessed the trial of various plans for the solution 
of the race-problem, and has seen most of them 
fail ; he knows much of the conditions of negro 
life, and is acquainted with the plans and opin- 
ions of the leaders of the race. His book con- 
tains nineteen chapters ; the most important 
topics treated are Radicals and Conservatives, 
The Leopard's Spots, Social Equality, The City 
Xegro, Religion as a Solvent of the Race Prob- 
lem, Surplus Negro Women, Rise of the Pro- 
fessional Class, Frederick Douglass, Higher 
Education of the Negro, Roosevelt and the 
Xegro. 

The temper of the book will surprise those 
who once thought that Professor Miller belonged

to the radical wing of the negro progressives. 
With two exceptions — these being fierce and 
excusable criticisms of Mr. Thomas Dixon and 
Mr. John Temple Graves — the papers making 
up the volume are moderate in feeling and state- 
ment ; they show evidence of plain common- 
sense, and there is an absence of that peculiar 
irritating quality that is usually found in race- 
problem literature. The style is clear and force- 
ful, vivid at times ; but never is the language 
violent. The author is fond of comparisons, 
and makes some effective ones. The following 
striking sentences are selected as typical : 

" Verbal vehemence void of practical power to enforce 
demands is an ineffectual missile to be hurled against 
the stronghold of prejudice." 

" All truly useful men must be, in a measure, time- 
servers ; for unless they serve their time they can 
scarcely serve at all." 

" Douglass insisted upon rights ; Washington insists 
upon duty." 

That he possesses a sense of humor, the writer 
frequently shows; as when, in quoting Freeman's 
suggestion for a solution of the Celtic and Afri- 
can race-problems, he remarks : " Let each Irish- 
man kill a negro, and get hanged for it." 

The best of the book is the first chapter — an 
interesting comparision of the policies and the 
leaders of the negro radicals and conservatives. 
Booker Washington is classed as a conservative ; 
Professor DuBois, and Trotter, editor of the 
Boston " Guardian," are leading radicals. The 
author is conservative, but will not yield unre- 
served allegiance to Washington. One interested 
in learning what the negroes think about the 
negro problem will profit by this discussion of 
the conflicting policies and the keen analysis of 
the motives and principles of the rival groups 
of leaders. Washington, the conservative, who 
came when others had failed, — " a time-server" 
in the best sense ; supported by white opinion ; 
who talks of duties rather than of rights ; con- 
structive, not critical ; quiet and diplomatic, not 
disputatious ; business-like, not heroic, is con- 
trasted with Trotter, the extreme radical, who 
would insist on absolute right, yield nothing for 
expediency's sake, and altogether disregard the 
opinions of whites. The estimate of Washing- 
ton and his policies is especially good. 

" Few men have shown such power of development. 
. . . He avoided controverted issues, and moved, not 
along the line of least resistance, but of no resistance at 
all. He founded his ■ creed upon construction rather 
than upon criticism. He urged his race to do the things 
possible rather than whine and pine over things pro- 
hibited." 

Of the radical chief, he says : 

" Mr. Trotter is well suited to play the role of a martyr. 
He delights in a reputation for vicarious heroics. Being 



possessed of considerable independent means, he willingly 
makes sacrifices for the cause, and is as uncompromis- 
ing as William Lloyd Garrison. Mr. Trotter, however, 
lacks the moral sanity and poise of the great emancipator. 
With him, agitation is not so much the outgrowth of an 
intellectual or moral comprehension of right and repre- 
hension of wrong, as it is a temperamental necessity. 
Endowed with a narrow, intolerant intensity of spirit, 
he pursues his ends with a Jesuitical justification of 
untoward means. Without clear concrete objective, such 
as the anti-slavery promoters had in view, he strikes 
wildly at whatever he imagines obscures the rights of 
the Negro race. He has the traditional irreverence of 
the reformer, an irreverence which delights to shatter 
popular idols. President Eliot of Harvard University, 
Theodore Roosevelt, and Booker T. Washington are 
shining marks for his blunt and bitter denunciation. He 
sets himself up as the moral monitor of the Negro raee." 

Professor DuBois, the other radical whose 
books on negro affairs have attracted wide atten- 
tion, began, the author says, as a calm scientific 
investigator, but under the influence of Trotter 
he became an agitator of the extreme type, one 
of the leaders of the " Niagara Movement " 
against color discrimination. It is the author's 
opinion that Professor DuBois is not suited to 
the role of agitator. 

" He is a man of remarkable amplitude and con- 
trariety of qualities, an exact interrogator, and a lucid 
expositor of social reality, but withal a dreamer with a 
fantasy of mind that verges on the fine frenzy. . . . 
His place is the cloister of the reflective scholar." 

In the rest of the book there is little that is 
wholly original ; it is chiefly a new treatment of 
old subjects. The author calls attention to a 
fact frequently unconsidered — that the rise of 
" democracy " in the South and the accession of 
" popular leaders " to power has resulted in 
greatly increased race friction. But, as he 
further says, in comparing the opportunities 
offered to the negro in North and South, — 
"It must be conceded that the Southern white man 
frequently displays commendable personal good-will 
toward individual Negroes who come within the circle 
of his acquaintance or control. In general, there is the 
widest margin between his avowed public policy and 
his personal demeanor. No reputable Southerner is 
half as bad as Senator Tillman talks." 

That religion is destined to be one of the 
strongest forces in the solution of the race 
troubles, is the belief of the author, who asserts 
that a basis for cooperation and mutual help- 
fulness will be found in the fact that nearly all 
negroes are members of the two great demo- 
cratic churches, the Baptist and the Methodist, 
— a fact true also of the Protestant whites. 
The negro professional and business classes are 
developing rapidly ; a fact of more importance 
than the criminality of the lowest classes. The 
statistics quoted seem to show that city life is 
not good for negro man or woman, and that

few opportunities are offered in a city. " As 
one walks along the streets of our great cities 
and views the massive buildings and sky-seeking 
structures, he finds no status for the negro 
above the cellar floor." On the other hand, 
the negro " by virtue of his geographical dis- 
tribution holds the key to the agricultural 
development of the South," — the concentration 
of the race in the black belt, the " Land of 
Goshen," being as effective now as it was fifty 
years ago to bar out white competition. 

So many opinions of Mr. Roosevelt's negro 
policy have been recorded that it seems proper 
to allow this one : 

" He is not permanently wedded to any one question 
as the dominant note of his career. He suddenly takes 
up a measure, settles it, and drops it, and goes in quest 
of issues new. And so in dealing with the negro he has 
established the principle but has desisted at the point 
df practical application."

Briefs on 2sew Books. 



In his latest book, " The Bridling of 
S^u^T Pegasus" (Maemillan), Mr. Alfred 

Austin has brought together a series 
of miscellaneous essays in criticism, — one of them 
inspired by the recent ter-centenary of Milton's 
birth, another delivered as a lecture some ten years 
ago before a Dante Society, still another published 
in one of the English magazines while Tennyson 
was yet alive, and most of the rest written appar- 
ently before the end of Tennyson's century. The 
first of the essays — there are ten in all. and each 
of them must make interesting reading for all who 
find pleasure in the critical essay — is on " The 
Essentials of Great Literature," and is a plea for a 
return to first principles in the criticism of poetry. 
These principles Mr. Austin conceives to be, first of 
all, melodiousness and lucidity ; and after these, the 
largeness of conception and the power that we asso- 
ciate with epic and dramatic verse. The dethrone- 
ment of poetry in popular favor in recent times he 
attributes largely to the neglect of these essentials 
in current criticism, though he holds that there have 
been other contributory influences at work, in " the 
perpetual reading of novels of every kind," the 
increase of the feminine or sentimental in literature, 
and " the febrile quality of contemporary existence." 
The sentimental note in our literature furnishes the 
theme of the second essay. The third treats anew 
the time-worn theme of Milton's likeness and unlike- 
ness to Dante. The fourth — the most substantial 
and the most spirited chapter in the book — deals 
with the relative rank of Byron and Wordsworth, 
and is an attempt to discredit sundry of Matthew 
Arnold's dicta in his famous prefatory essay on 
Wordsworth. Mr. Austin admits the justness of 



Arnold's assertion that Wordsworth must profit by 
the M boiling down " process to which Arnold sub- 
jected him in his volume of selections, but denies 
that this is true also of Byron; in like manner he 
argues, with much emphasis — and, it must be 
admitted, with something of plausibility — that 
Arnold was wrong in contending that Wordsworth 
reveals more of life than does Byron, or that he 
reveals life more powerfully ; he also demurs to 
Arnold's judgment that a poetry of optimism is 
necessarily a greater poetry than that in which the 
note of sadness and discontent is struck, although 
he seems to contradict himself later in his essay on 
" Poetry and Pessimism." Another stirring essay, 
u A Vindication of Tennyson," is directed against 
the poet Swinburne, whom Mr. Austin calls to 
account for having once charged Tennyson, strangely 
enough, with " inaptitude for musical verse." The 
remaining essays are concerned with " Dante's 
Realistic Treatment of the Ideal," " Dante's Poetic 
Conception of Woman," " The Relation of Litera- 
ture and Politics," and "A Conversation with 
Shakespeare in the Elysian Fields." The volume 
adds little or nothing to our stock of critical theory, 
is in no sense constructive, but in its insistence on 
faith in first principles and on loyalty to the masters 
it is bound to have a wholesome influence.

those women and girls at twenty-seven trades. Miss 
Butler's book is not a mere statistical statement of 
numbers, hours, wages, — these things have been 
accurately ascertained and stated, — but a sympathe- 
tic discussion of all the factors, social as well as 
economic, in the problem of women's employment 
in Pittsburgh. It appears that less than one per 
cent of the workers are skilled, while less than two 
per cent deserve the name of craftswomen ; twenty- 
three per cent do work that requires only dexterity, 
and of sixteen per cent not even dexterity is de- 
manded. This means that by far the great majority 
of the women studied are industrially helpless, — that 
is, doing work which makes no demand on their 
intelligence and affords little opportunity for ad- 
vancement. Miss Butler points out the serious con- 
sequences of this condition to the community. She 
shows that few (less than two per cent) get elsewhere 
— in clubs, social and educational, or in other social 
organizations — the training that is lacking in their 
work. One cannot begin to indicate the important 
facts here brought out, or the ways in which the 
Pittsburgh community, and many others of which it

is a type, must begin the task of protecting women 
wage-earners. In the United States as a whole, 
women are engaged in 295 of the 303 occupations 
specified in the Twelfth Census; and it is an inter- 
esting problem to trace out the beginnings of their 
careers as wage-earners, to see how recent a condition 
is their wide distribution in gainful occupations, what 
the conditions of their early industrial employment 
were, what wages they received, what were their 
hours of work and their surroundings. These things 
Miss Edith Abbott's " Women in Industry" (Apple- 
ton) tells us. It is the most comprehensive and care- 
ful study, historical and statistical, that has been 
made of the employment of women. In it their 
industrial life is traced from colonial times through 
the period of transition from house industries to the 
present factory system with its minute division of 
labor. A general survey of the fields of industry in 
which women were earliest employed, with many 
quaint and amusing quotations from old note-books, 
records, and periodicals, is followed by histories of 
special industries, chosen because of their impor- 
tance, now or earlier, in the employment of women 
workers. An interesting conclusion from the gen- 
eral survey is that, contrary to popular belief, '• the 
increase in the number of women employed in fac- 
tories has not meant the 'driving out' of men," the 
proportion of women in the New England mills 
having steadily declined since 1827, when they were 
nine-tenths of all the operatives, to 1900, when they 
were less than half. The data which Miss Abbott 
has collected disprove also another frequent asser- 
tion regarding women — that they have only recently 
become self-supporting ; the early records show that 
women supported themselves before the era of the 
factory. The discussion of the problem of women's 
wages confirms, in connection with the broad field 
of women's employment, what Miss Butler's study 
revealed as true for them in Pittsburgh : that for 
the most part " women not only do the low-paid but 
the unskilled work." This volume is in one respect 
unlike Miss Butler's: one seems to detect in it a 
hidden brief for the " cause of women " ; while the 
other work, though sympathetic, is nevertheless 
impartial in its attitude. Together they are distinc- 
tive and important contributions to the problem of 
woman's work. 



A Russian 
Admiral 
in Japan. 



Captain Vladimir Semenoff, of the 
Russian navy, in a book called " The 
Price of Blood " (Dutton) gives some 
realistic and often harrowing details of his capture 
at sea, in company with Admiral Rojestvensky, in 
the late war between Japan and Russia, and of his 
detention in hospital and prison on Japanese soil. 
The volume is a sequel to "Rasplata" and "The 
Battle of Tsushima," from the same pen, but is of 
independent interest as illustrating the kind of tactics 
and gunnery, on both sides, that made possible the 
■easy defeat of one naval force by another. Captain 
Semenoff himself was disabled by severe wounds, 
and must be given credit for putting forth such 



strenuous resistance as was in his power; but his 
narrative, perhaps not wholly with intention, reveals 
a state of laxness and incompetence in the Russian 
navy that fairly startles the reader. The narrative 
covers the period from the middle of May, 1905, 
to the sixth of December, when the author found 
himself back in St. Petersburg, with the disheart- 
ening prospect before him of being court-martialed 
for dereliction of duty. " Is this the price of blood? " 
he asked himself. " Is it for this we have shed it? " 
The translators of the book, Mr. Leonard Lewery 
and Major F. R. Godfrey, have indulged here and 
there in English that may fairly be called peculiar. 
For example, on an early page we read : " If but 
one of them had dared to evince his glee openly in 
my presence whatever, I think I would be able to 
clench my teeth in his throat till they would have met 
there." An interview with Admiral Nebogatoff, 
after he had submitted to the inevitable and saved his 
men at the expense of his honor, shows the unfortu- 
nate man in a rather touching frame of mind. " I 
had not the courage to do it," he confesses, in answer 
to the query why he had not sunk his ships and taken 
to his boats — an operation that he felt convinced 
would have condemned three-fourths of his men to 
certain death ; " I had not the courage to do it, and 
to this alone I plead guilty. I am sure you will 
believe it was not to save my own skin that I acted 
thus : I was the Admiral, and means would always 
have been found of saving me." The diarist im- 
presses one as a man of sturdy resolution and remark- 
able physical endurance. The conditions under 
which he kept his journal were extremely trying, to 
say the least. But to this difficulty much of the 
peculiar interest of the book is due. 

Under the title " Some Wonders of 
Sr" Biology " (Dodd, Mead & Co. ), Dr. 

William Hanna Thomson has re- 
printed a series of essays which originally appeared 
in " Everybody's Magazine." Their aim is the 
popular presentation of certain medical topics not 
generally understood by the layman. In fact, if 
" medicine " had been substituted for " biology " in 
the title, a more just relationship between the cover 
of the book and its contents would have been effected. 
For while the science of medicine is certainly applied 
biology, the relationship between the applied and 
pure science here is not so close in current thought 
or usage as quite to justify labelling as " biology " 
a book dealing with such topics as abnormalities of 
the mind, infection, and the like. Dr. Thomson is 
a fluent and entertaining writer. Four of the seven 
essays which make up the volume deal primarily with 
medical aspects of psychology. Here the author is 
at his best, — though the traditional granum talis 
will not come amiss even here. The last two essays 
are concerned with very broad and fundamental 
problems of philosophical biology. Their titles are 
respectively " Is this Earth the Only Abode of Phy- 
sical Life?" and "The Nature of Physical Life." 
On the whole it is fair to say that these two essays 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



361 



do not satisfactorily solve the questions they raise, 
although there is not to be found even a perfunctory 
expression of modest doubt on the author's part as to 
whether there may not still be left something worth 
discussing in regard to these great problems after 
this book is finished. Indeed, Dr. Thomson's manner 
of dealing with the intellectual difficulties implied in 
the chapter-headingsquoted, in its mingling of genial 
but at the same time absolute certainty, and the 
smallest but none the less distinct bit of a patronizing 
tone, is much like that adopted by the old-school 
country " doctor" in his amelioration of visceral ills. 
The conclusion reached is that the earth is the only 
abode of life, chiefly because " Man himself is alto- 
gether exceptional. . . . He is simply supernatural, 
and above all biology." Just what this really has 
to do with the questions under discussion, does not 
appear. But since the chief purpose of these last 
two essays is plainly to inculcate the highest moral 
principles, the logical non sequitur may perhaps be 
overlooked. 

Mrs. Francis B. Gummere (Amelia 
as a StCMik Mott Gummere) . in a volume entitled 

"The Quaker in the Forum" (John 
C. Winston Co.), considers " an aspect of Quakerism 
which," she says, with some excess of emphasis on 
the peculiar nature of her researches, " has hitherto 
received no attention." The writing of the book was 
suggested, she tells us, by the question of a professor 
of history in a New England college, who asked when 
the Quakers obtained the franchise in America. In 
seven somewhat rambling and pleasantly anecdotal 
chapters, the civil status of the follower of George 
Fox is discussed, with abundant references to author- 
itative sources of information. First the Quaker 
attitude toward the oath — hardly a topic that "has 
hitherto received no attention " — is considered at 
some length, with illustrative instances ; and then 
come chapters on the Quaker as a "Wanton Gos- 
peller," "The Quaker Franchise," "The Quaker 
Citizen and the Law," "The Quaker in Interna- 
tional Politics," " The Quakers and Mirabeau," and 
" Quaker Loyalty." The fifth of these essays seems 
to owe its being chiefly to the fact that the writer 
has in her possession a silver cream- jug presented by 
Dr. John Fothergill, a Quaker physician in London, 
to Benjamin Franklin, upon the latter's departure 
for America in 1775; this chapter is less compre- 
hensive and general in its nature than its title might 
lead one to expect. The book is appropriately illus- 
trated, chiefly with portraits. 

Romantic career 0n . e of ^ most interesting and 
of a Frenchman unique of careers among Americans 
inthe Civil War. is that of General Regis de Trobriand; 
and this career is commemorated in a worthy biog- 
raphy by his daughter Mrs. Marie Caroline Post. 
One could hardly ask for more in a novel of adven- 
ture than is to be found in this book. General de 
Trobriand came of a line of soldiers reaching back 
to William the Conqueror. He was the first in 



these hundreds of years to enter a different career, 
and this because under the House of Orleans the 
army was closed to him as a loyal upholder of the 
Bourbon line. Chance brought him to the New 
World in 1841 ; he married a New York heiress 
and remained a loyal American, though by birth he 
belonged to the high nobility and could claim the 
" sixteen quarterings " that gave him position among 
the proudest, and in his boyhood had made him a 
page to the Bourbon heir to the throne. Re*gis 
de Trobriand excelled in many things. He could 
swim seven miles, and then row his defeated contest- 
ants back to the starting-point ; he was a writer of 
skill and superior style in both French and English ; 
a musical and dramatic critic, an excellent musician, 
a painter of reputation, a friend and companion of 
noted men and women on both sides of the Atlantic. 
When the Civil War broke out, although he was in 
middle life, he offered himself to the Government, 
and served with distinction throughout the war, 
rising to the rank of Major General. A volume 
of his reminiscences, " Quatre ans de Campagnes a 
l'Arme'e du Potomac," is a fine story of the cam- 
paigns of that army, and did much to shape French 
opinion on American matters. At the close of the 
war he was made a colonel in the regular army, and 
served on the frontier until he was retired for age. 
The story of this interesting life is well told ; an 
obstacle to the enjoyment of it will be found by some 
in their inability to read and appreciate the best por- 
tions — letters, diaries, and the like — which are in 
French and untranslated. (E. P. Dutton & Co.) 



Correnxmdence " The Correspondence of Priscilla, 
of a eountett in Countess of Westmoreland," edited 
diplomatic life, ^y her daughter, Lady Rose WeigaU, 
and published by the Messrs. Dutton, constitutes a 
sufficiently bulky sequel to the " Letters of Lady 
Burghersh during the Campaign of 1813-14," 
which appeared in 1893. The writer of both 
series of letters was, by birth, a Pole ( Priscilla Ann 
Wellesley Pole) and a niece of the great Duke of 
Wellington ; while her marriage to Lord Burghersh, 
afterward eleventh Earl of Westmoreland, a soldier 
and a diplomat, connected her with another family 
of distinction. Her familiar correspondence, thought 
by her daughter to throw " a new and true light on 
much that has been misconceived, especially in re- 
gard to the formation of the German Empire," has 
the naturalness and varied interest that an intelli- 
gent and observing woman, residing successively at 
various European capitals and mingling with court 
society, might be expected to impart to her informal 
descriptions of her surroundings. As to the new 
light thrown on the formation of the German Em- 
pire, since her latest published letter is dated 1865, 
and her earlier references to the hopes and plans of 
German unity are neither very numerous nor very 
startling in their revelations, the illumination can 
hardly be considered dazzling. But those interested 
in European history of the last century, especially

those old enough to remember much of its making, 
will find entertainment in the book, which is, more- 
over, appropriately though sparingly illustrated and 
carefully indexed. 

"The Diary of a Daly Debutante" 
(Duffield) is made up of "passages 
from the journal of a member of 
Augustin Daly's famous company of players," if the 
title-page is to be credited; and a "publishers' 
note " informs the reader that the Diary, written in 
1879-81, has quite by chance become available for 
publication thirty years later. " It is printed ver- 
batim," we are to believe, "with only such omis- 
sions as have seemed expedient for personal reasons, 
the writer having since become well known in 
another walk of life." Who the writer is, may 
furnish food for conjecture to the veteran theatre- 
goer ; but as the parts assigned to her by Mr. Daly 
were always inconspicuous, and sometimes mute, 
there is small danger that her veil of anonymity will 
be rudely torn aside. Her first impressions of her 
fellow-players — some of them, like Mr. John Drew 
and Miss Ada Rehan, subsequently famous — are 
of special interest. The tone of the Diary is good- 
natured throughout; in fact, the daily entries are 
just such as a well-bred and wide-awake young lady 
might be expected to write under the given condi- 
tions. Play-going readers, especially if old enough 
to have witnessed the performances of the Daly 
company from the beginning, will find innocent 
amusement in this " Diary of a Daly Debutante." 



A book of English origin is intro- 
Popuiar talks duced to American rea ders, with the 

on astronomy . , » n 

title " Chats about Astronomy (Lip- 

pincott). The title is an accurate description of the 
contents. Mr. H. P. Hollis, the learned President of 
the British Astronomical Association, may be pre- 
sumed to have knocked the ashes out of his pipe (if 
he smokes), and to have summoned his stenographer 
that he might chat to him in more or less desultory 
fashion on a dozen loosely connected topics of astro- 
nomical import. Four of the chapters are about the 
earth ; the longest of the other eight attempts to give 
the reader an introduction to the constellations. 
Notwithstanding the chatty nature of these talks, 
the author has been careful about his facts — an 
exception being the story on page 41 about what 
Halley said concerning the return of his comet. 
There are evidences of careless proof-reading : on 
page 41 some Greek words have their accents and 
breathings in sad disarray ; such slips as " Astrope," 
"chartering stars," "Enke," "Aquita," " Delphi- 
nas," " Aldeharan," and " Crommelia," are not very 
creditable. But aside from these minor defects, the 
book may be recommended to anyone who does not 
care for a systematic and orderly treatment of the 
subject, and will not miss the beautiful illustrations 
with which popular books on astronomy are usually 
adorned. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. publish a new edition of 
" The Works of Sir John Suckling in Prose and Verse," 
edited by Mr. A. Hamilton Thompson. The plays and 
the letters, when added to the more familiar lyrics, make 
up a stouter volume than one would expect. The original 
title-pages of the several publications are reproduced in 
facsimile, and there is a considerable body of notes. 

" The aim of this volume is, among other things, to give 
a concrete discussion of ambiguity, to simplify the study of 
causal connections, and to treat with greater detail than 
is usually done the type of inference called circumstan- 
tial evidence, the nature of proof, and the postulates of 
reasoning." This is the programme of "An Outline 
of Logic," by Professor Boyd Henry Bode, published 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It is an excellent treatise 
upon a too-neglected subject, and one of its most useful 
features is found in the extensive set of appended 
exercises. 

One of the best series of supplementary reading- 
books that have ever been planned is that published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers under the editorship of Mr. 
Percival Chubb. The readings are to be from the most 
typically American of American writers, and a volume 
made up from the juvenile books of Mr. Howells opened 
the series not long ago. It is now followed by " Travels 
at Home by Mark Twain," a volume of passages taken 
from the author's accounts of life on the Mississippi 
and in the Nevada of " Roughing It." Two further 
volumes from Mark Twain are soon to be added to the 
series. We bespeak a hearty welcome from school 
people for these books. 

To the series of "Original Narratives of Early 
American History " (Scribner) the editor, Professor J. 
Franklin Jameson, has contributed a reprint, with exten- 
sive annotations, of Captain Edward Johnson's famous 
" History of New England," better known as " The 
Wonder- Working Providence of Sion's Saviour in New 
England " — for that is the title supplied by the running 
headlines of the original edition. It is now forty-three 
years since the last previous appearance of this work, 
as it was given to the public with a learned introductory 
essay by William Frederick Poole. Professor Jameson 
has availed himself of Poole's scholarship, and has con- 
tributed much of his own besides. He is himself a 
descendant of the author, which has lent a special interest 
to the task of presenting the work to a new generation 
of readers. 

A new edition of the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, 
in English translation, is being published by the Mac- 
millan Co. It is under the supervising care of Dr. Oscar 
Levy, and will comprise eighteen volumes in all. The 
following works are now at hand : " Thoughts out of 
Season," in two volumes, respectively translated by Mr. 
Anthony M. Ludovici and Mr. Adrian Collins; "The 
Birth of Tragedy," translated by Dr. William A. Hauss- 
mann; the first part of " Human all-too-Human," trans- 
lated by Miss Helen Zimmern; the first part of "The 
Will to Power," translated by Mr. Ludovici ; and " On 
the Future of our Educational Institutions " with 
" Homer and Classical Philology," translated by Mr. J. 
M. Kennedy. For readers who prefer their Nietzsche 
homoeopathic-epigrammatic doses, we recommend the in 
little book edited by Mr. A. R. Orage, and entitled 
" Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism." This volume is 
published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.

XOTES. 



Mr. Joseph B. Gilder, late editor of " Putnam's 
Magazine " and long associated with his sister Miss 
Jeannette L. Gilder in the management of " The 
Critic," has undertaken the editorship of " The New 
York Times Saturday Review." 

The interesting announcement is made of a life of 
Bret Harte for the " American Men of Letters " series. 
It is the work of Mr. Henry C. Merwin of Boston, who 
has been engaged upon it for several years, and has had 
access to unpublished manuscripts and other authorita- 
tive sources. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a revised edition of that 
sterling text, " The Leading Facts of American His- 
tory," by Mr. D. H. Montgomery. This book is par- 
ticularly well supplied with apparatus for the aid of 
both student and teacher, and has in a marked degree 
the merits of conciseness and accuracy. 

A lawyer's brief for the existence of God and a belief 
in immortality is embodied in Judge Lysander Hill's 
" The Two Great Questions " (Chicago: Began Printing 
House). The argument is based on a vast array of 
evidence offered by the processes of nature, and on the 
difficulty of explaining all the facts of existence by 
merely natural law. 

Descendants of the Scotch Irish, and genealogists of 
whatever ancestry, will be interested in " Scotch Irish 
Pioneers in Ulster and America," by Mr. Charles K. 
Bolton, Librarian of the Boston Athenaeum, a book 
which Messrs. Bacon & Brown of Boston announce as 
nearly ready. The work has been in preparation for 
several years, and will form an important contribution 
to the history of American colonization. 

Among the interesting books to appear in June is a 
new novel by Sienkiewicz, dealing with the problems of 
modern life. It is translated from the Polish by Mr. 
Max A. Dresmal, and is to be published by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. The same firm announces a new 
book by Selma Lagerlof, the famous Swedish author to 
whom was recently awarded the Nobel Literarv Prize 
of 840,000. The novel is entitled "The Girl from 
Marsh Croft," and is translated by Miss Velma Swanston 
Howard. 

Professor Willis L. Moore, Chief of the United States 
Weather Bureau, has written a text-book of " Descriptive 
Meteorology," which is now published by the Messrs. 
Appleton. It is an exhaustive work, abundantly illus- 
trated with charts and diagrams, and is designed for the 
needs of men in training for the work of forecasting. It 
may also serve well as a manual for advanced college 
students. We note with interest that the author is not 
to be numbered among the deserters from the Laplacian 
hypothesis concerning the origin of the Solar System. 

The most complete history ever prepared of an early 
American magazine is about to be published by the 
Boston Athenaeum. It comprises the weekly records of 
a club of brilliant young men of New England who 
edited " The Monthly Anthology and Boston Review " 
just a century ago. The book, which will be hand- 
somely illustrated, will contain an introduction by Mr. 
M. A. De Wolfe Howe, a complete collation by Mr. 
Albert Matthews, as well as extensive bibliographical 
notes of early books reviewed, and a complete list of 
authors of contributions to the ten volumes of the 
magazine.

ADDITIONAL TRIBUTES. 
The Dial continues to receive congratulations 
and tributes, from individuals and the press, on its 
Thirtieth Anniversary, just past. If any excuse 
were needed for adding to the full measure of 
appreciations printed in the preceding issue, it might 
be found in the fact that these also belong to the 
collection, as well as in their interest and the rarity 
of the occasion which called them forth.

Boston, May 1. 

I congratulate you on the Thirtieth Anniversary of 
The Dial. I remember the Dial of the Transcenden- 
talists, to which an aunt of mine was a subscriber, and 
always thought of it when I read your Dial, which I 
did for many years, and which I think has justified the 
words of the prospectus of the Dial of seventy years 
ago. Melvtlle W. Fuller. 

Supreme Court. Washington, D. C May S. 

I appreciate very much what The Dial has done for 
us and for many causes in which I am interested. The 
maintenance of such a journal represents a high form 
of public service, and I am not sure that it does not 
represent the highest form of public service now open 
to men. Benjamin I. Wheeler. 

University of California. April ts. 

This note from a constant reader of The Dial dur- 
ing the thirty years of success you and your associates 
and friends are so happily celebrating has been delayed 
only to give you time to digest all the more important 
things coming to you. Yet constant readers are not 
without value, I take it, and their very existence is 
evidence of their appreciation, not loud but deep. The 
Dial, especially to one trained in judicial methods, is 
a balm as well as an education and inspiration, and my 
gratitude for the privilege of its comfort and instruc- 
tion during these many years would be hard to plumb. 
May at least another thirty be its and yours to bless 
with beauty and worth all the friends among whom I 
hope always to be. Eugene E. Pbussino. 

Chicago, May 6. 

I wish to congratulate The Dial on its Thirtieth 
Anniversary. The Dial is one of the very few literary 
periodicals that I find worth reading at all. So from 
my point of view you have been greatly successful. You 
should take the foremost place among our periodicals 
devoted largely to literature. Wilbub L. Cross. 

Yale University, May U. 

I always enjoy reading The Dial. I like its com- 
mon sense, its good judgment, its conscientious fairness, 
its thorough scholarship. I will not call its deliverances 
oracles, but they give me a somewhat similar feeling at 
once of confidence and of finality. The Dial does tell

That The Dial should be alive to celebrate the 
Thirtieth Anniversary of its birth should not be a source 
of wonder, but when one looks at the cheaper magazines 
and most of the higher priced ones, all of them grovel- 
ling before the raw intelligence of the masses, it is a 
wonderful achievement to make a success of such a 
publication as The Dial, and the credit should be in 
accordance with the achievement.

I send my congratulations on the Thirtieth Anniver- 
sary of The Dial. I wish to add my testimony to the 
abundance which you have received. It is now a good 
many years since I began reading The Dial, and no 
more welcome visitor comes to me. I appreciate espe- 
cially the generosity of its criticisms: those who are 
admitted into its precincts receive the best of greetings. 
May you long live and prosper. Louis J. Block. 

Chicago, May 3. 

My very cordial congratulations to The Dial on the 
achievement of so long a period of consistent service to

have the privilege of a similar congratulation upon the 
prolongation of this period to a full centennial. 

Hebbebt Putnam. 

Library of Congress, Washington, D. C, April 28. 



My heartiest congratulations on your Thirtieth Anni- 
versary. The fine thing about The Dial is that it does 
not depend on another light, but adds to the literary 
world a lustre of its own, while marking the progress 
of that world. And this may you continue doing for 
another generation. David Y. Thomas.

able paper to the critical reader, the publisher, and the 
general public. John Macbae (E. P. Dutton & Co.)

We hasten to offer our congratulations upon your

The Dial, which celebrates its thirtieth anniversary 
this week, is a literary journal of remarkable enterprise 
and independence, and Sir Walter Besant once declared 
it to be unsurpassed by any other literary journal in 
America or England. It was founded in 1880 by Mr. 
Francis F. Browne, who named his venture after the 
famous " Dial " which Margaret Fuller conducted, and 
to which Emerson, Thoreau, and many of the other 
New England transcendentalists, contributed. Margaret 
Fuller's journal ceased after sixteen quarterly numbers ; 
but its namesake has had a longer, if not quite such a 
brilliant, career. Mr. Browne is justly proud of the 
fact that he has directed its policy for so long a period, 
and that, though published in a city often described as 
the most unliterary in the United States, it is read all 
over the Republic, and includes among its contributors 
many of the most distinguished men of letters in 
America. London Nation. 

Chicago has amused itself, and others, by announcing 
itself from time to time as " the literary centre " of the 
nation. This is an indefinite phrase, and the boast is as 
meaningless as it is harmless. The city has a few 
authors, a few publishers, and many readers of books. 
But in one respect it is unique. It has the only purely 
literary journal of the first rank in America. May 1 
The Dial celebrates its thirtieth anniversary. Begun 
as a monthly, it was changed to a fortnightly publica- 
tion eighteen years ago, and it is still under the control 
of its first editor, who has been associated with literary 
effort in Chicago for nearly half a century. It has stood 
for the highest ideals in art and politics, although touch- 
ing upon the latter only incidentally, and it has undoubt- 
edly exercised upon its readers a powerful influence 
towards better things. It has earned the praise of great 
authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for its unbiased 
judgments and its fearless independence, and its refusal 
to compromise with unhealthy and sensational tenden- 
cies in literature has won general admiration. 

Chicago Tbibune. 

With the first week of May comes the issue of The 
Dial commemorating the close of its thirtieth year. 
During that long interval, a generation of human life, 
its founder, Mr. Francis F. Browne, has been continu- 
ously its editor, an achievement in personality and 
literary journalism that is almost without exception. 
For thirty years The Dial has come regularly out of 
Chicago, recording and commenting upon the passing 
and the permanent in literature with a just and author- 
itative voice. During most of that time, and at the 
present moment, The Dial stands alone as the only 
American newspaper whose sole object is the chronicling 
and criticism of literary achievement. May it continue in 
length of years and in wisdom. Boston Tbanscbipt. 

That admirable literary journal, The Dial, of Chi- 
cago, has just rounded three decades of continuous 
publication under the same editorial auspices. . . . Mr. 
Francis F. Browne has been editor of The Dial since 
its first number appeared in May, 1880. For twelve 
years he issued the periodical as a monthly, but for the 
past eighteen years it has been a fortnightly. The Dial 
has never missed an issue, and its stability of manage- 
ment is almost unique in American journalism. Its 
editor has made us all his debtors many times. His has 
been a quiet but effective influence in the nation's liter- 
ary development, which we hope may be continued far 
into the future.

THE DIAL 



365 



To The Dial, that admirable fortnightly review of cur- 
rent literature and vehicle of sound criticism, our hearty 
congratulations on the occasion of its thirtieth anniver- 
sary. Our personal congratulations, too, to its founder 
and helmsman, who has kept it steady on its consistent 
course by the polestar of duty to the best interests of 
literature in the main phases or relations of the term — 
the author's, the reader's, the publisher's. . . . By 
austere adherence to its high standards, by develop- 
ment on its original right lines, and avoidance of the 
commercial temptations that beset a journal with an 
ideal, The Dial stands to-day on an eminence of 
success and international recognition that vindicates the 
judgment of its founder and his faith in the Emersonian 
maxim of hitching one's wagon to a star. 

Milwaukee Sextixkl. 

During the whole three decades of its existence this 
unique and estimable literary fortnightly has been 
edited by its founder, Mr. Francis F. Browne, whose 
strong personality and high critical standards have 
somehow achieved the apparently impossible feat of 
maintaining in Chicago the one purely literary period- 
ical in the country. Mr. Browne's success, like that of 
Theodore Thomas with his orchestra, was due to no 
concession to popular lack of taste, but to a sort of stern 
enthusiasm for the best. Mr. Browne and Chicago are 
alike to be congratulated on The Dial's anniversary. 
Chicago Record-Herald. 



To have brought a literary journal safely through 
thirty years of life in Chicago, in a country not famous 
for enthusiasm over affairs of culture, is an admirable 
achievement. It is a tribute in part to editorial devo- 
tion, but more particularly to the probity which has dis- 
tinguished The Dial. Concessions have been made 
neither to the general preference for sensational litera- 
ture nor to advertisers' desire for indulgence. This rare , 
standard has never been deserted, and the success of 
The Dial is good testimony that there are publishers 
and public who appreciate disinterested criticism. That 
such success may continue and greatly increase must be 
the wish of all Mr. Browne's contemporaries. And 
Chicago especially must desire that this anniversary be 
the portal to even wider and stronger influence. 

Chicago Evexixg Post. 

The Dial is to be congratulated upon its thirtieth 
anniversary ; but those who have a full appreciation of 
its high aims, a realizing sense of how firmly it has 
abided by the faith for sound literature, and how well 
it has performed its work in its chosen field, will hold 
with us that thirty years is but a milestone in a career 
which is destined to continue with honor for many years 
to come. New Yokk Times Saturday Review. 



On May 1 The Dial celebrates its thirtieth anniver- 
sary. It is pleasant to reflect that such a paper, printed 
in the West and devoted to the interests of letters, has 
had a life so long and a career so honorable and useful. 
The Dlal is one of the very few periodicals in the United 
States which has steadily stood for high aims and ideals, 
and in a consistent and dignified and fair-minded fashion 
kept its readers in touch with our literary production. 
There is special reason for congratulation that such a 
publication has been developed in the Middle West ; but 
locality aside, the country at large should rejoice that 
The Dial exists, and bids fair to become a centenarian. 
It is one of Chicago's most distinctive and creditable 
institutions. The Bellmax (Minneapolis). 



The Dial of Chicago is thirty years old this spring. 
It is a high-class periodical, and it is no slight accomplish- 
ment to bring a literary periodical in America safely 
through so long a life. We wish it well, and hope it will 
live many times as long, with no loss of the cultivation 
and independence which have marked its history for 
three decades. Collier's Weekly. 

The Dial deserves and will receive the hearty con- 
gratulations of the best men and women, widely scat- 
tered in space and in station. It has been true to the 
vision which called it into being. It has been an im- 
partial and sagacious interpreter of current literature. 

Uioty (Chicago). 

Every lover of scholarly criticism, of unbiassed 
opinion, of pure English, and of a sane viewpoint, will 
rejoice that The Dial has achieved its splendid record 
and maintained its high literary standard. 

The Graphic (Los Angeles, CaL) 

The Dial celebrates this month the Thirtieth Anni- 
versary of its appearance among the literary journals of 
this country, or, perhaps truer still, of the world, since 
its praise is in every centre of literary culture abroad as 
well as at home. An unusual circumstance of its history 
is that during all this time its policy has been directed 
by the same editor, whose rare gifts have been unre- 
servedly dedicated to the work of bringing The Dial 
to a place of preeminence among journals of its class. 
His reward is the praise of the discerning. . . . While 
The Dlal remains faithful to its present ideals and to 
its own splendid history, always will there be assurance 
of a criticism which unites sympathy and insight with 
the highest integrity.

FOUR UNIQUELY SIGNIFICANT BOOKS 



HEALTH AND SUGGESTION : The Dietetics of the Mind 

by Ebnst, Baron von Feuchterslebbn. Translated in full and 
edited by Ludwig Lewisohn. $1.00 net. Published in 1838, it has a 
peculiar interest for the present day, for it was the fruit of the 
psychotherapeutic movement which parallels the one that is receiv- 
ing so much attention in our time. 

Dr. Worcester of the Emmanuel Movement says of this book: 
" It contains the principles of our whole project, and expresses many 
phases of our thought better than we are able to express it." 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIANITY 

by Otto Pfleiderer, D.D. The last work of the great theologian, 
completing, with "Christian Origins" and "Religion and Historic 
Faiths," his trilogy of popular works. An account of the evolution- 
ary process through which the Gospel of Jesus has developed into 
modern Christianity. Translated by Daniel A. Huebsch, Ph.D, 
Each volume, $1.60 net ; postpaid, $1.60. 



LATTER DAY SINNERS AND SAINTS 

by Edward A. Ross, Professor of Sociology at the University of 
Wisconsin. In The Art of Life Series. 50 cents net. The first part, 
Latter Day Sinners, compares the old forms of wrong-doing with the 
more refined violations of law and morals current to-day. The sec- 
ond part, Latter Day Saints, presents former ideals of virtue as well 
as those which have evolved as a result of twentieth century civiliza- 
tion. Professor Ross's keenness in analyzing social disorders and 
fearlessness in prescribing remedies are always stimulating. 

CARL MARX: His Life and Work 

by John Sparoo. This is the first biography of the founder of 
modern Socialism and represents thirteen years of research. The 
early history of the movement, the personality of Marx's contem- 
poraries, and the revelation of hitherto unpublished facts, make the 
book noteworthy. Indexed and fully illustrated. $2.50 net ; 
postpaid, $2.75.

OF the many tributes to George Meredith

"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

When Love Calls Men to Arms 

By STEPHEN CHALMERS 

Illustrated by HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY 
$1.50, postpaid 

From the time when Don John escapes from the Spanish galleon in Kilellan Bay until 
Rorie comes to the end of his story of Don John's daughter, the winsome but wilful 
Mariposa, there is breathless action in this fine Scotch romance by the new romantic 
novelist. The book is full of big scenes and alluring characters, not the least of whom 
is Bordeaux, as he calls himself, the friend of " Will Shaxper." 



The Confession of a Rebellious 
Wife 

SO cents net; postage 6 cents 

A remarkable human document, written from the inside, voic- 
ing a real heartache, a real puzzle, a real resolve. The story 
stands out in its fullness, and the reader gains a deep knowl- 
edge of the nature of this one woman, and through her of that 
of many. A book that will command a wide reading, it is so 
deep, so personal, so typically American.

Magazine — is imbued with fine humor and human nature. 



From Irish Castles to French Chateaux 

By NORMA BRIGHT CARSON, Editor of "Book News Monthly" 
Profusely illustrated from photographs, many of them taken by the author. 

The value of this book to the traveller is that, while covering no new fields of travel, it gives the better service for that very rea- 
son. It takes the traveller over the journey he will inevitably desire and expect to take, however far afield he may go here and 
there, and suggests to the would-be traveller or recalls to him who has travelled what is most interesting and indispensable. 
From Its fine atmosphere of culture the book might be called a " literary pilgrimage."

The Coming Religion 

By Rev. CHARES F. DOLE 

An important book, bringing a message to all mankind. Its 
influence among men of every faith will be for good, as em- 
phasizing the central, universal truths of religion, as offering a 
gospel of hope, joy. work, progress, as making life more, not 
less significant, the continuance of life hereafter more not less, 
hopeful. The author's style is quotable, and his manner in 
presenting his subject is characterized by illuminating illustra- 
tions and comparisons, and by fine moderation and charity 
towards all men of all creeds. It is a book of big qualities for 
all thinking men.

raphy. It is a singularly interesting book, the work of a man 
with high ideals and wide knowledge of affairs. His work 
as advertising manager of the Ladies' Home Journal, the 
Delineator, the Munsey publications, and his experiences as 
one of the owners and up-builders of Everybody's are full of 
interest for every man and woman in every branch of the pub- 
lishing business, and his modest story of success is an inspira- 
tion to every young American.

The "DialY' Natal Day 

While the personal habits of more or 
less distinguished authors are not ob- 
noxious to us, we confess to liking 
better the baseball reports and the 
Herald's dramatic critiques. (The last 
dramatic criticism we recall reading in 
the Herald was the last one penned by 
Mr. Meltzer some years ago.) Of an 
incurious mind, we do not greatly 
care, whether Miss Marie Corelli 
wears a straight' front or a strait jacket ; 
whether Mr. G. B. Shaw wrote his 
Shakespeare essays by a tallow dip or 
by. flashes of lightning; whether Laura 
Jean Libbey anointed her curls with, 
vaseline or in the good old-fashioned 
way. That Montaigne aroused his 
sleeping son with music, that Buffon 
wore lace ruffles at his wrist and a 
sword at his side when he set him down 
to write the Histoire Naturelle, that 
Thoreau made his own lead pencils 
and Stevenson his own style, that 
Flaubert declaimed and shouted his 
phrases so that his mother could 
not sleep, and that the Brownings did 
not read their poetry to each other— 
these things are good gossip. When 
Montaigne, Buffon and the rest are 
forgotten, personal intelligence con- 
cerning our temporary authors will be 
worth printing— but possibly not till 

then. 

Yet woe to the literary magazine 
which in this our commercial country 
eschews all prattle of industrious pen- 
men ! So, at least, say the daring souls 
who have launched periodical upon 
periodical only to see them succumb to 
the competition of the . newspaper. 
Only the Bookman survives— a sur- 
vival, we believe, due in a great meas- 



ure to the combination of journalistic 
instinct and literary taste possessed by^ 
Mr. Arthur Bartlett Maurice, who, in 
his always interesting " .Chronicle and 
Comment," steers craftily between the 
Scylla of fatuous exploitation and the 
Charybdis of stodgy and sterile fact, 
rilustrations, of course, help the 
Bookman mightily. Could any pe- 
riodical, without pictures, live by lit- 
erature alone? The answer is at hand : 
The Dial, of Chicago, dates. The Dial, 
of Chicago, lias lived by literature 
alone, lo ! these thirty years — conducted 
by the original founder, edited by its 
first editor. Nearly all the English 
reviews look to politics, to public af- 
fairs,, as well as to letter's. But to let- 
ters alone is the Dial devoted. This 
month of May marks its thirtieth birth- 
day — the natal day of a journal known 
seventy years ago as the Dial, of Bos- 
ton — a journal edited for four years 
by Margaret Fuller, and including 
among its contributors Emerson and 
Thoreau. Its continuous and prosper- 
ous conduct in Chicago, since its re- 
vival in 1880 in a course of dignity 
without dulness, and with a regard for 

timeliness without triviality, seems to 
us a very considerable achievement. 
Our congratulations to Mr. Francis 
Fisher Browne — printer, poet, lawyer, 
editor, publisher; once a mere New 
Englander, but long and latitudinously 
of Chicago and California — the bowels 
and red blood of our continent. The 
West is really a wonderful place 
when you come to know it; and that 
has been our good fortune.

THE THIEF OF VIRTUE 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS. 12mo. $1.50.

Robert Dodsley must be regarded as one of the remarkable personages of the

during the first half of that century with whom this footman, who wrote poetry and 
plays and afterward became the most celebrated publisher of his time, was not on 
terms of considerable intitnacy. The volume includes various letters and agreements

AMERICAN AND ENGLISH 
PERIODICALS. 



Mr. William Archer has a sharp eye for 
things American. Viewing us from afar, and 
sojourning "in our midst," he has used it to 
good purpose, and has recorded in singularly 
clear terms the results of his observation. His 
vision is not altogether free from astigmatism, 
but it is both steady and penetrating. While 
Mr. Archer is particularly concerned with mat- 
ters pertaining to his metier as critic of the 
drama and student of the technical problems of 
the playhouse, he is more than a specialist in 
this restricted field, and has envisaged many 
other scenes and situations. He has discoursed 
upon our manners and our morals, he has pre- 
sented us with a solution of our negro problem, 
and he has rushed into the conflict that rages 
about our spelling of the English language, — 
not taking, we regret to say, the side of the 
angels. His latest contribution to our enlight- 
enment upon our own affairs — and, incidentally, 
to the enlightenment of his fellow Britons by the 
method of comparison — is found in a study of 
" The American Cheap Magazine," contributed 
to "The Fortnightly Review." The study 
should please us, on the whole, because it 
redounds to the credit of American enterprise. 
Mr. Archer says : 

"Of the many differences between America and 
England which do not altogether minister to onr 
national self-complacency, none is more striking than 
the contrast between our sixpenny monthlies and the 
ten-cent or fifteen-cent magazines that crowd the 
American bookstalls. On the surface, the contrast is 
most humiliating, and though, when we look below the 
surface, we shall find reasons which diminish its signifi- 
cance, it remains, when all is said and done, a disquiet- 
ing phenomenon." 

In making this comparative study, Mr. 
Archer deliberately excludes fiction from his 
purview, — in the first place, because he seldom 
reads magazine fiction ; and in the second place, 
because he thinks it is very much the same in 
quality on both sides of the ocean. His inter- 
est is in that section of the contents which may 
be described, if euphemistically, as serious, in 
order to give it a name which shall distinguish 
it from the mere products of invention. Now 
he finds, broadly speaking, that the " serious " 
features of the English sixpenny magazines are 



380 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



" magnified and scarcely glorified tit-bits," and 
" articles on everything that can pass the time 
for an idle brain, and cannot possibly matter 
either to the individual or the nation." In the 
American popular magazines he finds, on the 
other hand, " articles of absorbing and illumin- 
ating interest," the type of contribution which 
is " a richly-documented, soberly-worded study 
in contemporary history, concentrating into ten 
or twelve pages matter which could much more 
easily be expanded into a book ten or twelve 
times as long." Of the group of a half-dozen 
or so of magazines thus referred to, he says : 

" There is nothing quite like them in the literature of 
the world — no periodicals which combine such width 
of popular appeal with such seriousness of aim and 
thoroughness of workmanship." 

Having introduced his subject with these 
general propositions, Mr. Archer proceeds to 
the task of specific illustration. He takes some 
two dozen recent numbers of the magazines in 
question, analyzes their contents, and presents 
them in a classified arrangement. The lengthy 
list of titles selected includes such as Judge 
Lindsey's " The Beast and the Jungle," Judge 
Gay nor 's " The Looting of New York," Gen- 
eral Bingham's articles about the New York 
police, a group exposing the political corruption 
of San Francisco, a group upon the Pinchot- 
Ballinger dispute, Miss Tarbell's " Where the 
Shoe is Pinched " and " A Tariff-Made City," 
« A Carnival of Graft," " The Negro in Poli- 
tics," "A Continent Despoiled," "The Ominous 
Hush in Europe," "The Terror on Europe's 
Threshold," "Barbarous Mexico," and "Spik- 
ing down an Empire." These examples are 
taken from the political groups ; under the head 
of social topics we find mention of " The Case 
against Trinity," " Blasting the Kock of Ages," 
" The Godlessness of New York," " Beating 
Men to Make Them Good," "What Eight Million 
Women Want," " The Bird Tribute to Vanity," 
and " Divorce and Public Welfare." Still other 
groups cite " The Vampire of the South," " The 
Sacrifice of the Innocents," " Does the Weather 
Bureau Make Good ? " " On the Trail of the 
Ghost," " The Lure of Gold," and " The Inde- 
cent Stage." 

We have given only a small part of Mr. 
Archer's list, but it is enough to make us 
understand why an Englishman should rub his 
eyes at the spectacle of a magazine activity 
which leaves the enterprise of his own country 
so far behind. But we think our critic takes 
the entire manifestation a little too seriously. 
It is true that these are all serious subjects, and 



it is also true that almost every article in the 
list is the product of an extended investigation 
and of an amount of labor far out of proportion 
to the ten or twelve pages that the article fills. 
But those of us who for a series of years have 
had these articles as a steady diet have come to 
realize that their fundamental note is sensation- 
alism, and that the underlying motive for their 
multiplication is commercial rather than phil- 
anthropic. The instinctive common sense of 
the American people has labelled them as 
"muck-raking" productions, and an instinctive 
optimism has discounted their lurid imaginings 
by about ninety per cent. They have stirred 
us up, no doubt, and often in profitable ways ; 
but their bias and exaggeration, their deter- 
mination to make sensational points at no mat- 
ter what sacrifice of sobriety, have prevented 
them from having much influence over serious- 
minded people. They have aroused emotional 
rather than reflective natures; and this is a 
dangerous thing to do. Mr. Archer thinks that 
these articles have been " an incalculable force 
for good," of which we are by no means sure ; 
but he admits that they exhibit the logical 
weakness of " an insufficient thinking-out of the 
fundamental ideas on which their crusade is 
based." To our mind a much more fatal weak- 
ness is found in their attitude of parti pris, in 
their assumption that everything is either black 
or white, and in their unblushing appeal to preju- 
dice. Some of them are doubtless comparatively 
free from these faults ; but since Mr. Archer 
seems to cover them with a blanket approval, we 
feel bound to suggest that the opposing point of 
view is likely to result in a sounder judgment. 

Mr. Archer wishes that the English magazines 
might follow the example thus set them on this 
side of the water ; and if they were to follow it 
in moderation the enterprise would probably be 
desirable. There are subjects enough for exploi- 
tation at the English editor's hand, if only he 
realized his opportunities. The reasons why he 
does not make the venture are two in number, 
and are thus stated : 

" The mildest of the progressive magazines, if its 
matter applied to England and were published in En- 
gland, would beget such a monthly crop of libel suits as 
would bring unheard-of prosperity to the legal profes- 
sion." 

Furthermore, the English cheap magazines 
"have neither the circulation nor the advertisements 
which would enable them to pay for it. The American 
editor will pay more for a single article than an English 
editor would pay for the whole matter of one of his 
numbers." 

These reasons are pretty nearly prohibitive, as

we may easily understand. But if the English 
public cannot benefit by the freedom (degenerat- 
ing into license) of our American editors, and by 
the gambling spirit which controls their expen- 
diture, it has its own organs for the discussion 
of serious public concerns. If we could support 
in this country a group of monthlies like " The 
Contemporary," "The Fortnightly," and "The 
Nineteenth Century," and a group of weeklies 
like " The Spectator," "The Nation," and "The 
Saturday Review," we would gladly exchange 
for them the whole galaxy of our muck-raking 
magazines. Sobriety, in the long run, is more 
effective than sensationalism as an agency of 
reform, and writing that appeals to the intel- 
ligence has a farther-reaching and more lasting 
influence than writing that appeals chiefly to 
the emotions. 



THE CHARM OF GUIDE BOOKS. 



I have often wondered that in his catalogue of 
" books which are no books " (comprising " Court 
Calendars, Directories, Draught Boards bound and 
lettered on the back, Almanacs, Statutes at Large," 
and other biblia a-biblia), Charles Lamb did not 
include Guide Books. To be sure, there were but 
few such in his day. Travelling was expensive and 
wearisome, and the booksellers had but little induce- 
ment to forestall Baedeker. Guide Books indubit- 
ably there were, but it is a question whether the 
gentle Elia ever held one in his hand. To-day, how- 
ever, every library of even tolerable pretensions has 
(not boasts) its topmost or lowermost shelf of red- 
covered books, mute and inglorious discarded com- 
panions of wanderings by sea and by land. A 
brand-new Guide Book is, at the best, but endured 
as an intellectual vade mecum; a Guide Book out- 
of-date is poor company indeed. 

Now, perhaps from sheer contrariness, I want to 
say a good word for these cast-off fellow-travellers, 
these humble, dusty, upper-shelved volumes, whose 
titles are the indexes, it may be, of happy days when 
we were younger, and Europe and Egypt and even 
the more distant portions of our own continent were 
still to us a land of dreams. I could dwell on the 
memories that are embalmed in these well-thumbed 
little volumes : on the faded ivy leaf that still marks 
the page devoted to Rydal Mount ; the pressed fern 
that grew ••in the crannies" of the Coliseum; the 
blood-red field-lily from the shadow of Rachel's 
Tomb. But just now I am not concerned with the 
sentimental value of Guide Books, rather with their 
power to interest and amuse from an entirely imper- 
sonal standpoint. 

What more delicious reading for a weary brain 
than this local "Surrey" ? Opening at random, I 
find myself not far from Dorking — '"an admirable 
halting-place for the pedestrian, who might stay here 



for a month and find a new walk every day." 
Then follow the directions for roads and foot-paths, 
" along the ridge of the downs," " over Milton 
Heath," "through the woods to Deepdene," or 
•• under the fir-clad Ridland Hill." The very names 
are soothing, and as we wander through English 
meadows and lanes the thought of pestilential prob- 
lems, of financial crises, of ward politics, are less 
insistent than the piping of the redbreast in the 
holly-bush, or the plashing of the waterfall by the 
moss-grown mill beside our path. 

For practical assistance in the matter of topog- 
raphy, history, and, to some extent, local color, the 
Guide Book is far superior to the gazetteer. Where, 
for instance, can so much condensed information as 
to modern or ancient Egypt be found as in the little 
red-covered volume which has been the butt of so 
many shafts of ridicule, launched by novelists who 
are not ashamed of drawing very long bows indeed? 
If you want to learn about your own country, read 
one of those small German Guides, and be wise. 
Are you puzzled by a newspaper despatch from some 
obscure hamlet of Norway or Austria, your Guide 
Book, with its faithful maps, sets you right- 
In the older specimens of this despised class 
of literature are quaint directions and suggestions 
redolent of other days. My own earliest trip to 
Europe was in 1873; and I remember that one of 
the first oddities I encountered was fractional silver, 
I having been "brought up," so to speak, entirely 
on paper scrip, which was in use here between 1862 
and 1875. It is not surprising, therefore, to find 
in Morford's European Guide for 1873 the expenses 
of the trip reckoned both in currency and gold — 
the latter, as is expressly stated, " being at 120." 
The traveller was warned that he u would always be 
charged for a whole candle" at his hotel, "whether 
he used it or not." At that time, probably not half 
a dozen hotels in Europe were lighted throughout 
by gas. Electric light, of course, was not dreamed 
of, outside of Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand 
Leagues under the Sea," which was published that 
same year. 

In a White Mountain Guide Book of 1869, the 
reader is told : " Be careful, as soon as you arrive " 
(at the Crawford House, " a large, new edifice ") 
"to book your name for a horse to Mt. Washington, 
as often all the ponies are engaged for a day or two 
beforehand." The Mt. Washington Railroad was 
opened that summer, but was not connected with the 
Maine Central, the distance between the lower ter- 
minus and Fabyan's being traversed by old-fashioned 
coaches. The carriage road was completed in 1861. 
History, by the way, has been repeating itself in 
1909. The Western "burro" has been imported, 
and travellers have once more ridden up the steep 
old bridle-path from Crawford's to the Summit. 
Do n't forget to book for a burro ! 

Perhaps the queerest, quaintest old Guide Book 
I have in my possession is a little volume of about 
four by five inches, called " La Vera Guida per Chi 
Viaggia in Italia." It was printed at Rome in 1775,

and is dedicated, in four pages of extra large type, 
"All' Illustris8imo Signore Tommaso Jenkins"! 
Who this most illustrious Thomas Jenkins was, I 
have never been able to ascertain ; but I trust he was 
proud of the honor and of the sturdy little book in- 
scribed with his name. The frontispiece represents 
a post-carriage with two postillions, and a rider ahead 
lustily blowing his horn. There are many delightful 
maps, showing post-roads; needless to say, the old- 
world geography of the country was practically the 
same then as now. Included in the general pre- 
fatory "Instructions" is a feature which I do not 
remember finding in Baedeker. " A traveller," says 
the author, " ought before all things to commit 
himself to God, without whose assistance every 
enterprise is vain." And, accordingly, a form for 
devotions is given forthwith — a humble and rather 
touching little prayer for the safety of the tourist 
and of the dear ones he has left behind. A little 
further on are careful directions how to deal with 
wolves and bears en route. "If the traveller has 
no arms wherewith to defend himself, he can escape 
from the peril by striking fire from a flint-and-steel, 
wolves especially being afraid of fire, essendo i Lupi 
specialmente assai timorosi delfuoco." 

Willis Boyd Allen. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



June advice from the "Old Librarian's 
Almanack " will apply just as well, or as ill, to 
this year of grace 1910 as to the year 1774 for 
which it was ostensibly written. On the calendar 
page we read : " Stand not outdoors, gaping like a 
ninny at nature. She will take care of herself. 
Bead your books." Seasonable counsel, that, for 
those who have been stretching their necks and 
straining their eyes at all hours of the night in 
search of Halley's Comet. Halley's Comet will take 
care of itself. In this summer season, with vacation 
at hand, there is danger of idle and otherwise unde- 
sirable visitors to the sacred precincts of the library. 
Note the following : " No Person younger than 20 
years (save if he be a student, of more than 18 
years, and vouched by his tutor) is on any pretext 
to enter the Library. Be suspicious of Women. 
They are given to the Reading of frivolous Romances, 
and at all events, their presence in a Library adds 
little to (if it does not, indeed, detract from) that 
aspect of Gravity, Seriousness and Learning which 
is its greatest Glory." More in the same strain is 
added, but we refrain from quoting further, lest we 
get into trouble with the New Woman, the Suffra- 
gette, and other " advanced " members of the sex, 
and will content ourselves with one more excerpt. 
" Let no Politician be in your Library, nor no man 
who Talks overmuch. It will be difficult for him to 
observe Silence, and he is objectionable otherwise, 
as well. No Astrologer, Necromancer, Charlatan, 
Quack, nor Humbug ; no Vendor of Nostrums, nor 



Teacher of false Knowledge ; no fanatick Preacher 
nor Refugee. Admit no one of loose or evil Life ; 
prohibit the Gamester, the Gypsey, the Vagrant. . . . 
See to it that none enter who are Senile, and none 
who are immature in their Minds, even tho' they 
have reach'd the requir'd Age." With the advent 
of summer comes a blessed relief from the season of 
rush and worry, whereof that worthy bibliothecary, 
Master Enoch Sneed has written : " I am so be- 
pestered and bothered by persons insinuating them- 
selves into the Library to get Books that frequently 
I am near to my Wit's end. There have been days 
when I was scarce able to read for two Hours con- 
secutive without some Donkey breaking in upon my 
Peace." Few librarians of the present day, how- 
ever, will be disposed to take literally Master Jared 
Bean's advice for the summer season, — " Let no 
intruder put your ease in doubt ; lock fast the door 
& keep the rascals out." 

The Sunday-newspaper monstrosity is not 
without prospect of mitigation. We have long 
believed it must change or pass. There may be 
readers willing to spend their Sundays delving in 
these literary rubbish-heaps, — the fact that they 
continue to be produced indicates it. But to ordi- 
nary self-respecting mortals, who want the important 
news on Sundays as on other days, and object to 
being compelled to traverse a wilderness of sensa- 
tional print and a morass of vulgar pictures to get 
it, the Sunday paper is a pest and a calamity. A 
good illustration, which we give at first hand, occurs 
to us. A prominent journalist was asked by his 
managing editor what he thought of a certain feature 
of last Sunday's paper ; to which the frank reply 
was given that he (the journalist) never read the 
Sunday paper. " Don't you ? " said the managing 
editor, a bit disappointedly, — adding, rather grimly, 
" Well, I don't blame you, — I wouldn't read it 
myself if I didn't have to ! " The encouraging 
news comes from Boston of the issue there of a 
modest one-cent Sunday journal, uniform in char- 
acter with the same paper's week-day issues, and 
containing the news of the world, and a sufficiency 
of other matter, unencumbered with a mass of rub- 
bish. Mr. Frank A. Munsey, founder and proprietor 
of many magazines, in adding a soberly-restrained 
Sunday issue to his "Boston Journal," has rendered 
a service to newspaperdom and to the reading public. 
He well says in his first number (May 8) : " The 
Sunday newspaper is an illogical product. It is no 
more a newspaper than it is a magazine, or weekly 
paper, or comic paper. If we want a newspaper and 
nothing else, why should we be compelled to buy 
half a dozen other publications with it? ... If we 
want a magazine, why be compelled to buy a comic 
weekly ? If we want a comic weekly, why be com- 
pelled to buy a story-paper? If we want a story- 
paper, why be compelled to buy the cut-out scheme 
for children ? If we want the cut-out scheme, why 
be compelled to buy a magazine?" The general

public, we believe, will be grateful for this relief, and 
gladly devote some of the time thus saved to the art 
gallery, the museum, and the public library reading- 
room, whose Sunday opening has not been facilitated 
by the prevalence of the time-consuming Sunday 
newspaper in its present bloated shape. 

Two aspects of literary leisure present them- 
selves. Its charms may be those of the siren — 
seductive and ruinous ; or the delights of lettered 
ease may be productive of worthy works of litera- 
ture (a u Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," 
for example) impossible to one not entirely in com- 
mand of his time and movements. In the Preface 
to Volume III. of the " New Variorum Edition of 
Shakespeare," occur these words from the genial 
editor's pen : " Can we fail to prize the flashes of light 
(all too few) thrown here and there upon Shake- 
speare by Charles Lamb, that genius, wasted in 
the India House, whom, had England known the 
gift of God, she would have pensioned bountifully 
and set to recording the thoughts these plays evoked 
in him that we might be brought into nearer com- 
munion with the great Poet than, with all our labori- 
ous verbal criticism, we have yet been able to reach ? " 
But can one who knows the life of Lamb and remem- 
bers the barren tedium of his later years, when retire- 
ment and a handsome pension left him at leisure to 
record all the beautiful thoughts evoked in him by 
whatever means, fail to suspect that it was precisely 
that daily grind at the India House that drove his 
chafed spirit to seek relief in those exquisite essays 
that now delight us in the reading as they solaced 
him in the writing? One of our most charming 
present-day essayists, not unworthy of mention in 
the same breath with Elia, is the pastor of a large 
church and occupied with the varied duties of an 
extensive parish. "What wise person would wish the 
author of " The Gentle Reader " set free to spin 
out his thoughts for us at ample leisure and in cold 
blood?

An American season in the London book- 
market now cheers the heart and swells the bank 
account of more than one fortunate Yankee author. 
Colonel Roosevelt and Commander Parry naturally 
create a demand for their writings wherever they 
go ; and the English circulation of their works is ac- 
cordingly very brisk. Mark Twain's lamented death 
has sent his numerous British admirers back to their 
" Innocents " and their ** Roughing it." The death 
of another American, the self-expatriated author of 
the Saracinesca series of romances, together with the 
posthumous appearance of his " Undesirable Gover- 
ness," has made even more evident than before the 
favor he enjoys among English novel-readers. Con- 
sidering the number of Mr. Crawford's books and 
the speed with which they were produced, one must 
admit that even the later and less carefully studied 
display an astonishing wealth of resource and mas- 
tery of the romancer's art. We long ago learned 
what sort of characters to expect from his pen, and 



what sort of conduct to expect from his characters ; 
but nevertheless they hold the attention to the end. 
Another London favorite of the hour (and perhaps 
longer) is Mr. Winston Churchill, whose latest story, 
" A Modern Chronicle," is having a brisk sale that is 
expected to be of some continuance. On the whole, 
American literature seems to be making its way. 

The reprehensible re-christening of books, 
which causes so much annoyance and confusion to 
the reading public, 60 many bibliographical blunders 
to librarians, catalogue-makers, and collectors, and 
such needless bother to book-dealers, deserves to be 
scored in the sharpest of terms. How many an 
admirer of Mr. Thomas Hardy, for example, or of 
the late Marion Crawford, eager to read every 
volume from the favorite novelist's pen, has been 
betrayed by a mere difference of titles (in English 
and American editions) into buying, borrowing, or 
begging an already once-read, if not twice-read, tale! 
A late communication to the London " Athenaeum " 
touches feelingly on this subject in describing a case 
possessing some peculiar features. " I have been 
comparing," says the writer, " two novels by Cleve- 
land Moffett, 'A King in Rags,' published by Sidney 
Appleton in 1908, and < The Battle,' published by 
John Milne in 1909. I find that to all intents and 
purposes they are the same work rearranged. . . . 
Cases like this are very trying both to librarians 
and readers." 

A summer resort's sumptuous library is about 
to be added to the attractions of Great Barrington, 
among the Berkshire hills in Massachusetts. The 
present library building in that beautiful town is 
unworthy of its environment, and its fine site will 
soon be occupied by a fifty-thousand-dollar structure. 
This may not mean that the butterflies of fashion 
who each summer and autumn make gay the streets 
of the old town will turn blind eyes and deaf ears 
to the lure of the golf course, the afternoon tea, the 
evening hop, and the loud-honking automobile, and 
will all become patrons of the public library; but at 
least the permanent residents of the place will have 
the satisfaction of seeing their common stock of the 
world's best books worthily housed. 
• • • 

The increased demand for Mark Twain's 
books, since his death, is met by his publishers 
with a large reprinting of " Life on the Mississippi," 
" A Tramp Abroad," " Roughing It," '"Pudd'nhead 
Wilson," and " Sketches Old and New." We sur- 
mise that the presses will have also to get busy 
presently with new impressions of " Tom Sawyer " 
and "Huckleberry Finn." It is an all too common 
experience among the frequenters of public libraries, 
to find no copy of either of these masterpieces on 
hand. The late Sir Walter Besant was enthusiastic 
in his praise of " Huckleberry Finn," and there have 
not been wanting others to rate the book as its 
author's greatest production. Those who have not 
yet tasted its delights have a pleasure in store for 
which they are to be envied.

Essays in Divers Moods.* 



However stoutly it may be maintained that 
there is no demand for poetry and essays, yet 
the poets and essayists are not to be silenced. 
Like Garrison, they will be heard ; and it would 
be an evil day for current literature if they 
should weaken in this determination. The num- 
ber and quality of these essay-books and poetry- 
books continually appearing, and enjoying at 
least a very respectable public-library patronage, 
we must regard as creditable to all concerned. 
The light essay may lure the reader-f or-pleasure 
away from a too exclusive indulgence in novels 
to unexpected delights in other literary fields. 

" Essays on the Spot," by Mr. Charles D. 
Stewart, author of " The Fugitive Blacksmith " 
and " Partners of Providence," is a book con- 
fessedly lacking the studied unity of a Greek 
tragedy, but possessing the inevitable unity of 
the writer's personality and peculiar habits of 
thought and expression. " My only experience 
with the Emersonian advice of ' Room alone 
and keep a journal,' " he tells us, " had been 
in the middle of a Texas prairie under the stars 
in space ; and that is really room." Much of 
the dash and freedom of Texas cowboy life has 
found its way into these highly unconventional 
records. A typical example is to be found in 
" The Story of Bully," — the amazing feats of 
strength of a Texas steer, with some excellent 
bovine philosophy interspersed. " On a Mo- 
raine " treats of geology and agriculture and 
human nature in Wisconsin, and is full of 
shrewd observation. In a wholly different essay 
on Coleridge's " Kubla Khan," the writer enters 
territory not quite so familiar to him from boy- 
hood. Ingeniously, though rather laboriously 
and at undue length, he makes of the fragmen- 
tary poem a sort of cosmic myth. " Here do we 
see," he announces, after quoting the opening 
lines, " the great Power making the universe. 
And more especially the blue dome that is over 
all — the sky and its contents." It is all studi- 
ously worked out, and for that reason so much 
less delightful than Mr Stewart's spontaneous 
utterances elsewhere in the book. A chapter

on " The Study of Grammar " is original and 
full of novel ideas ; but, again, we like the 
author better out in the open than in the study 
or library. 

In Mr. Hilaire Belloc 's reprinted articles 
from " The Morning Post " we have a book of 
light and short essays conceived in the best of 
moods. " On Everything " forms a companion 
volume to the same author's similar collection 
entitled " On Nothing." As in the Hegelian 
sense " everything " and " nothing " are syn- 
onymous, the two sets of essays may be regarded 
as identical in theme. In seven or eight small 
pages to an essay, the writer discourses, in a 
friendly and sometimes intimate fashion, on all 
sorts of minor topics, choosing often the Baconian 
form of chapter-heading, as, " On Saturnalia," 
" On Song," " On High Places," " On Streams 
and Rivers," « On Old Towns," and " On Rest." 
His praise of song is enthusiastic and not unde- 
served ; but when he goes so far as to say, "Nor 
is there any pleasure which you will take away 
from middle age and leave it more lonely, than 
this pleasure of hearing Song," he underesti- 
mates the calm delights of reflection and silent 
observation that are the birthright of rational 
man as distinguished from that other vertebrate 
biped, the twittering bird. Mr. Belloc's pleas- 
ing manner is too well known to need commen- 
dation. 

Miss Elizabeth Bisland relates that from 
her earliest childhood her favorite exercise 
has been what might properly be called ligno- 
equestrianism ; and so, in a somewhat "hobby " 
mood, she gives us her opinions and pet enthu- 
siasms in a series of thirteen chapters, largely 
literary in theme, entitled collectively "At the 
Sign of the Hobby Horse." Especially season- 
able is her essay on nature-books, though she 
does not refrain from a little mild ridicule of 
the fad-chasing variety of nature-students and 
nature-writers, and of course she has her word 
to say about intelligence in animals. In an 
entertaining chapter on children's books she 
praises the late Sophie May as " the first realist 
among the writers for children," and relates 
how she herself earned the money to buy 
the " Dotty Dimple " series by denying herself 
butter for three months. She then deplores 
what seems to her a marked inferiority in the 
series succeeding the Dotty books. But she 
forgets that Dotty herself was the successor to 
Prudy; and there are to-day hosts of infants 
as delighted with Flyaway as with the earlier 
Dotty. We suspect Miss Bisland had outgrown 
this sort of literature when she tried to recap-

ture the former rapture in the later series. Con- 
temporary magazine poets, with their " diluted 
little drop of thought in one verse of from four 
to six lines,"' are evidently not among the 
writer's hobbies. Her book is fresh and vig- 
orous and worth reading from beginning to end. 
Mr. Edward Thomas's " Rest and Unrest " 
is made up of nine short studies in human 
nature — rural human nature in an English 
setting. They are all pitched in a minor key, 
with the occasional sounding of a tragic note. 
Many a glimpse is had of cottage interiors and 
the inmates there gathered about the hearth or 
the table. Mention of a certain "crowded meal of 
new loaves, seaweed 'bread,' bacon, apple pasty, 
and plentiful thin tea," makes the uninitiated 
wonder what seaweed bread may be. Local 
color rather than action — for little or nothing 
is really done — gives this slender book its 
character. There is far more of rest than un- 
rest — perhaps an excess of drowsy stillness — in 
its pages. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Nature Virtues.* 



Although to people who are not enthusiastic 
over everything that is classed as " Nature " 
the nature-virtues may not seem virtues at all, 
no nature-lover has any doubt that they are pre- 
eminent among human qualities, and as precious 
as they are rare. The more widespread the fad 
of pretending to them, the more inimitable they 
seem to those who are conscious of possessing 
them. 

The first of these virtues is an original es ti- 
mate of value, quite at variance with worldly and 
sometimes even with scientific standards. Since 
the time of Agassiz, who " had no time to make 
money," the real nature-lover has sacrificed 
worldly prosperity to the delight of his vocation 
— or avocation, whichever it may be ; at least he 
has done this if circumstances were not too much 
against him. He knows quite well that a blue- 
bird is more beautiful than a bond ; that the

blossoming of a violet is more vital than the 
formation of a syndicate, and that it is a dese- 
cration to look upon growing grain with an eye 
only to the price it will bring in the market. 
He knows also that a live butterfly is more inter- 
esting and more important to science than many 
dead hippopotamuses. Consequently, if he lives 
up to his virtues he is more or less regardless 
of conventions. He does not affect sporting cos- 
tumes, but " wears out his old clothes "; he rises 
any time after dark and walks in the most un- 
likely places to find out what the owl is doing, or 
to see the crow, when he wakes in the early morn- 
ing, "yawn with that prodigious black beak after 
he has withdrawn it from under his wing, then 
stretch one wing and one leg, as birds do"; he 
forgoes his Thanksgiving dinner for a couple 
of sandwiches and a tramp on the seashore ; he 
stays away from the opera to hear the first 
meadow-lark of the season ; he takes his pet bear 
with him for a walk down the village street; 
and he weeps, if he feels bike it, when the cat 
that has shared his cabin and been his friend for 
a season is spirited away. 

Such a person is, of course, a being of un- 
quenchable ardor. He can well afford to smile 
indulgently at the fancied nature-lover whose 
patience shows itself in sitting comfortably on 
a bank all day to see the birds go by, — for he 
himself has knelt three hours in the mud to get 
a photograph of a marsh- wren, and has been 
protected from rheumatism by his fervor ; he 
has scaled a forty-foot pine-bole with disaster to 
his skin, to bring a bear cub down unharmed, 
and has spent days wading in bogs up to his 
waist in water. Crowning all his other virtues 
is that special quality by reason of which he is a 
nature lover. Call it what you will — catholic- 
ity, sympathy, humanitarianism, tenderness, or 
love — its touch makes the world of men kin 
with the world of animals. To it the destruction 
of life, except in defense of other life, is impos- 
sible ; and the vaunting of trophies — except 
perhaps those of the camera — is repugnant. 
This high quality is wholly democratic and in- 
clusive ; and though it may recognize the fasci- 
nation of a humming-bird as greater than that 
of a loon, or the beauty of a deer as more than 
that of a porcupine, it esteems and cherishes 
the individual traits of each. 

A small group of this season's nature books 
exemplify these virtues. Mr. Job, in telling us 
"• How to Study the Birds," adds considerably 
to the tale of the abundant reward that has come 
to him in his loiterings in bird-land, and tells 
explicitly and fully how others may follow in his

footsteps and reach the same delightful results. 
The novice may learn from this volume where 
he may find nearly all of our common birds and 
many of the rarer species, how he would best 
equip himself, how he should manage his camera 
and keep his records, and even how to proceed 
in the delicate task of finding nests. The photo- 
graphs are many, and unusually beautiful, show- 
ing many birds " caught in the act," which have 
never before been photographed in so intimate 
a way. 

The perfectly unaffected and very entertain- 
ing story told by Mr. Wright about a black bear 
which he caught as a cub and reared to maturity 
is as good proof as one could ask of the pleasure 
to be derived from companionship with a dumb 
animal. Children will enjoy this book hugely, 
for " Ben " was a jolly, rollicking scapegrace, 
who had more thrilling adventures than fall to 
the lot of most children, and always kept his 
wits about him. The pictures of him in the vari- 
ous stages of his babyhood, and especially when 
he is learning to ride his pack-horse, are much 
more amusing than if they were of a human 
baby. The last half of the book is given to a 
good study of the black bear and his habits. 

Equally worthy of our acquaintance are the 
" Wilderness Pets at Camp Buckshaw. - ' A 
crow, a raven, two bear cubs, a moose calf, two 
sea-gulls, and a porcupine, besides a cat, some 
dogs, and several young people, kept that happy 
spot enlivened through a summer, and, in spite 
of some prejudices among the pets, derived 
mutual benefit from the experience. There are 
good portraits of all the members of the demo- 
cratic family, and the story of their life together 
is a notable addition to the broader sociology 
which " Uncle Ned," the leading spirit of Camp 
Buckshaw, was teaching his "nephews and 
nieces." 

A book of specialized interest is Mrs. Mabel 
Loomis Todd's " Cycle of Sunsets," in which 
the author describes the most beautiful of the 
sunsets she saw in a year from her home on 
Amherst hill. The descriptions are well worth 
reading, and will have a useful influence if they 
encourage others to pay more heed to the daily 
pageant of the western sky. Mrs. Todd weaves 
a college love-story into her experience of clouds 
and sunset light, and thus adds a human interest 
to her calendar of radiant pictures. 

A little book by Mr. Winthrop Packard, 
which the author modestly calls " Woodland 
Paths," gives very charming expression to the 
spirit of the true nature-lover. It shows no 
limitations of preference, except that it is a dis- 



tinctly spring book. Crows, butterflies, eels, 
bullfrogs, the brook, spring dawns and sunsets, 
Ponkapog Pond and the bogland around it, 
wild-flowers, weeds, and almost all the birds, 
are a part of life to the author, and he has the 
grace of words to convey the poet's meaning 
which he gathers from them. A sense of humor 
is almost always latent, too, in his view of things. 
In explaining why the March hare goes mad, 
he says : 

" Mad March winds are a good test of stability of 
soul. He who can stand their weltings with serenity, 
can watch his unanchored personal belongings go mad 
with the March hare, and still thrid the sombre boskage 
of the wood with sunny thought and no venom beneath 
his tongue, ought to be President. Even the New York 
papers could not make him bring suit." 

Mr. Packard's "■ Woodland Paths " lead, as he 
suggests the roads about Ponkapog do, " from 
the land of humdrum to the country of ro- 
mance." Unpretentious as are the pages of 
his book, they stir in one the virtue of imagina- 
tion — which also should have been mentioned 
as one of the chief of the nature- virtues. For 
example, he says : 

"I never tramp these roads, which it sometimes 
seems as if the pudwudgies moved about in the night 
for the confusion of men, without being lost, at least 
for a time, and finding a new boulder to worship. Once, 
thus lost, I found a little gem of a pond, which hides 
in the hollows a half-mile or so east of Pongapog Pond. 
This, too, I fear the pukwudgies move about in the 
night, for I hear of many men who have found it once 
and sought it again in vain."

men have already learned by way of coopera- 
tion with those seasons. To sow, to reap — 
of all the arts of man, these are the most sym- 
bolic ; and in right sowing and right reaping 
depend all things everywhere. 

It would seem to be almost an instinct — the 
desire that leads a man who has grown a cab- 
bage or planted an orchard, or a woman who has 
achieved the art of bedding out a plot of hardy 
perennials, to set forth his or her experience in 
a book. The reviewer of even a part of the 
annual output of garden books must often shake 
his head over the problem of grouping into a 
well-balanced article the widely separated themes 
and styles which gather themselves on his table 
at this time of the year. 

Four volumes on the list now to be considered 
may be classed as pleasant and profitable hand- 
books for beginners in the art of gardening. 
In Miss Higgins's "Little Gardens for Boys 
and Girls," both style and matter are simplified 
to a degree which would make its pages a de- 
light to a child of ten or twelve years old who 
had a bit of ground all his own, a very little 
money, and an honest heart turned in the right 
direction. From Mr. Rexford's long experi- 
ences in " Indoor Gardening," many harvests 
have already been gathered. He has long sat 
as chief justice in a court of appeals to which 
countless readers of journals devoted chiefly to 
household affairs have turned in troubled hours, 
and from the endless questions which he has 
been asked concerning ailing rubber-plants or 
despondent geraniums he has learned exactly 
how to put into words the advice most needed 
by owners of a window-full of potted plants, or 
the more fortunate proprietor of a small green- 
house. There be folk who will gain more hope 
for the welfare of the republic from Mr. Par- 
sons's study of " Childrens' Gardens " than 
from official announcements of many " Dread- 
naughts " or the convening of delegates of many 
congresses of peace. " True and well-balanced 
conceptions of the great game of life " can 
nowhere be more successfully taught than by 
observation of and cooperation with the laws 
that govern plant-life, upon which all sociological 
problems, directly or indirectly, depend. The 
inspiring pages of Mr. Parsons's book have for 
their basis the work at the Children's Farm 
School at Dewitt Clinton Park in New York 
City ; and so well is that work done that it is 
hard to see why a second book need be written 
on that subject for years to come. Into " The 
Garden Primer," Miss Tabor and Mr. Teall 
have condensed manv of the facts which all 



gardeners ought to know, but which many have 
yet to learn, the result being a handbook both 
pleasant and valuable. Good advice about soils, 
fertilizers, insecticides, and fungi-destroyers, 
outweigh in value the appended u Kalendar," 
which is not infallible. 

From handbooks like these, one turns to 
another world in the collection of verses " In 
Praise of Gardens," compiled by Mr. Temple 
Scott. The margins of its pages are not all 
that could be desired, but otherwise the setting 
of the poems is satisfactory for a book which is 
of a happy price that permits it to go on many 
bookshelves where the costlier volumes are 
barred out, and of a pocketable size which is an 
added recommendation for it now that garden- 
days are here, and there are those who can 
even read in gardens. On each alternate page 
a dial-inscription serves as headline, and the 
divisions into which the selections are grouped 
are also prefaced by dial-lines. The range of 
poets is both long and broad : Homer sings of 
the Garden of Alcinous, Theocritus of later 
Greece, and King Solomon his old Asian Can- 
ticle. The vernal melodies of Chaucer usher 
in the songs of the English bards, which extend 
from Elizabethan days to those of the king 
who has just laid down the sceptre of the island 
famous alike for its gardens and its poets. 
There are loved voices for which we listen here 
in vain, but the omissions are comparatively 
few when all things are considered. 

Still another anthology of garden verse is 
Mr. W. A. Bradley's " The Garden Muse," pub- 
lished almost simultaneously with Mr. Scott's 
volume, noted above. The compiler in this case 
" has simply sought to please himself, and those 
whose taste chimes with his own, by weaving a 
chaplet of choice garden flowers culled more or 
less at random from the richest and rarest pas- 
tures of poetry." Mr. Bradley has a right eye 
and ear for the best poetry, and the bouquet 
which he has brought together is of a fragrance 
and diversity to delight every one who, either 
in fact or fancy, owns a garden. 

So comprehensive and scholarly a book as 
Mrs. Cecil's "History of Gardening in England" 
has heretofore scarcely crossed the Atlantic to 
show us the difference between the best we can do 
in gardens and the splendid things of which the 
mother country can boast in countless instances. 
As the Honorable Alicia Amherst (now Mrs. 
Evelyn Cecil), the writer of this noble volume 
has had the inestimable privilege of a life-long 
association with the great library of her father, 
known as the Amherst Library ; and in the

exhaustive bibliography which serves as one of 
the appendices to this history, she attests her 
familiarity with an astonishing number of the 
great old books of the great old English horti- 
culturists. We learn something of the sincerity 
of her studies from the short preface to the 
three editions of the work already published, in 
which, speaking of her preparation for decipher- 
ing the old English and old Latin (or Latinized 
English) of the deeds, leases, rolls, and other 
manuscripts necessary to her work, she says : 
" I learnt to read the cramped handwriting and 
abbreviations of the old records I had to con- 
sult, by practising on the Wyklif, Northwode, 
Hampole, and other fourteenth century manu- 
scripts, to which I had free access at my home." 
Some fifteen years ago Mrs. Cecil was given 
the Freedom of the Gardener's Company, and 
was furthermore admitted to the Freedom of 
the City of London — honors almost never be- 
stowed upon a woman — in recognition of her 
scholarship, as evidenced in the present work. 
As one turns these absorbing pages one sees the 
old-time life of England, political, social, and 
ecclesiastical, interpreted through its gardens 
in a manner wholly fresh and delightful. The 
" brief island-story " is told, not to the thunder 
of the captains and the shouting, but in the 
beneficent flowerings and fruitings which came 
of changes and developments of the national life. 
The Romans built walls that have crumbled and 
vanished, but a list of Saxon plant-names show 
how many fruits and vegetables they introduced. 
The Norman Conquest affected the common 
people through the new methods of horticul- 
ture introduced ; the Crusaders brought home 
strange Asian growths ; and from the wild sea- 
rovers many treasures were gained from foreign 
shores. The Tudors gardened very differently 
from the monks who had kept the gentle art 
alive through long ages, and the Jacobeans had 
yet other plans than those of the days of the 
Georges and Victoria. Every great event that 
has affected England — the Revolution, the 
Edict of Nantes, the Boer war — has meant some- 
thing new, something beautiful, to the old gar- 
dens, whose yew hedges and pleached alleys 
have sheltered so many generations that the life 
of one man is but an incident in their quiet 
growth. Mrs. Cecil's tireless industry has made 
it possible for us to identify almost every plant 
named by our oldest poets and garden-writers, 
and she has chosen her illustrations so fitly that 
they include facsimiles of ancient MSS., plans 
and elevations of noteworthy estates, portraits of 
eminent herbalists, and photographic reproduc- 



tions of old iron gates, fountains, leaden statues, 
and topiary work, all of which may be studied 
with profit and delight. The great lessons 
which her book has for Americans lie in the 
noble use of evergreen hedges, in the salutary 
humility which recognizes that such historic 
gardens can never be for us, and a becoming 
gratitude that our friends across the sea hold 
their treasures in such tender reverence.

tions, a hundred and forty in number, selected 
from several hundred negatives made by the 
author, are likely to lead the reader to think 
that snap-shooting game in Africa is mere child's 
play. The text will, however, prove that nervous 
prostration is more likely to follow the man with 
the camera than buck-fever is to attack the man 
with the gun. A charging rhinoceros at a dis- 
tance of fifteen yards may be an excellent target 
and a sure bag for a modern gun, but as the 
object of a harmless camera it presents quite 
a different picture. Yet Mr. Dugmore got one 
of his best photographs under just such condi- 
tions. At another time he and his companion 
set up a thorn-shed for protection, made prep- 
arations for " flash-lighting " lions, and when 
the lions came within three yards of the hiding- 
place, growling in a nerve-racking fashion and 
displaying fantastic shapes in the dark, the 
daring sportsmen not only released the flash- 
light but calmly went out into the field where 
the four lions were in concealed quarters, and 
re-set their apparatus. A typical passage in the 
volume recounts the photographing of a herd of 
buffalo, considered by African hunters to be one 
of the most dangerous of all game. 

" I returned with the utmost caution to where the 
cameras were, and after making everything ready, 
crawled through the grass as carefully as possible 
toward where the buffalo were still feeding. In some 
way they had become suspicious, and were sniffing the 
air in a way that boded ill for me and my chances of 
obtaining any pictures. Not daring to go nearer than 
about 125 yards, I quietly lifted the camera above the 
level of the grass, focussed carefully, and with trem- 
bling fingers pressed the button . . . Were they get- 
ting ready to charge? and if so, what should I do? I 
had no rifle with me, and my companion was some dis- 
tance away; and at any rate, what would one rifle do 
in the wav of stopping such a large herd if they meant 
mischief? There being no visible means of escape, I 
could see nothing to be gained by wasting time in 
conjecturing; so I distracted my thoughts by taking 
another photograph just as one of the big bulls was 
bellowing. Then to my great relief they turned tail 
and retreated to the shelter of the deep forest. As 
they went I got one more picture just before the herd 
had disappeared." 

Though Mr. Dugmore went into the African 
wilds primarly for just such scenes and pictures, 
his book has the additional charm that comes 
from a wide sympathy for all natural beauty and 
from a sympathetic understanding of man in 
his savage state as revealed in the native tribes 
dwelling in British East Africa between Nairobi 
and Guaso Nyiro. Such a book as this, with 
its large page, clear type, and wonderful illustra- 
tions, will appeal to a far larger circle of readers 
than the multitude of books on Africa that are 
now finding their way to the reading table. 



Another book on Africa has lately appeared 
that is worthy of serious attention — Mr. 
Alfred J. Swann's " Fighting the Slave-Hunters 
in Central Africa." The author's residence of 
twenty-six years, from 1882 to 1909, in the 
great lake region of the Dark Continent, makes 
him one of those who can speak with authority 
on the history of the overthrow of the slave- 
trade carried on during the last quarter of the 
nineteenth century by Tippu-Tib and his part- 
ner Kumaliza, together with other notorious 
slave-drivers. The primeval African wilderness 
makes a startling background for Mr. Swann's 
account of his efforts to wipe out the nefarious 
human traffic which existed around Lakes 
Nyasa, Tanganyika, and Victoria Nyanza, and 
of his ultimate success in establishing a rigid 
patrol and a protectorate for the hapless natives. 
The human element in this tragic drama played 
for so long a time in Central Africa assumes 
almost heroic proportions in the great trades. 
Mr. Swann's account of African development 
will enlighten many readers, both missionaries 
and others, who have followed Livingstone's 
and Moffat's accounts of their efforts to heal 
" Africa's open sore " in the British dominions. 

The sumptuous volume entitled u Peaks and 
Glaciers of Nun Kun," by Mrs. Fanny Bullock 
Workman and Dr. William Hunter Workman, 
will appeal particularly to those who have scaled 
high places on the globe. Students of geography 
too will find the present volume, like all the 
well-written narratives of these famous mountain- 
climbers, bristling with statistics of that little- 
known group of mountains lying about a hundred 
miles east of Srinagar, in the Province of Suru, 
southwest of Ladakh and northwest of Zaskar in 
the Himalayan region. These mountains were 
first seen by the authors in 1898, when they 
were making another exploration in Northern 
Ladakh ; but their determination to explore the 
wondrous snow-bedazzled rock-peaked range was 
postponed until 1906, when they succeeded in 
making more extensive discoveries and more 
accurate investigations of the Nun Kun range 
than any other explorers have succeeded in 
doing. Airs. Workman's ascent of Pinnacle 
Peak is a record ascent for women — twenty- 
three thousand and three hundred feet. " It 
was indeed," says Mrs. Workman, in speaking 
of the septette of great peaks rising in solemn 
majesty in the weird crepuscular light, "a 
D'dmmerung of the mountain-gods, different in 
meaning from Wagner's G 'otter 'd'dmmerung, 
yet filled with the same spirit as that which 
inspires his finest Xibelungen music, the deep

significance of Nature." Four sleepless nights, 
an excessive scarcity of oxygen, a diet of granu- 
lar kola, and a temperature ranging from high 
summer heat to below-zero cold, with the resul- 
tant depressing mental and physical difficulties, 
made up some of the personal cost for this glo- 
rious sight in the dwelling-place of the gods. 
Ninety-two superior illustrations of mountain 
scenery enhance the beauty and interest of the 
work. 

Mr. Paul Niedieck's volume entitled " With 
Rifle in Five Continents," published last year, 
was apparently so well received that the author 
hastened to publish his more recent experiences 
in Siberia and Alaska in a book having the title 
" Cruises in the Bering Sea." This account is 
different from that recorded in his first book, 
in that it deals more with ethnological observa- 
tions and with the natural resources of the 
countries traversed. Nevertheless, the author — 
who may be fittingly characterized as one of 
the globe-chasing Nimrods now so numerous — 
is best seen in his natural guise of a mighty 
hunter. After a not uninteresting account of 
his voyage from Seattle to Japan, he takes us 
bear-hunting with him -in Kamschatka, thence 
to Marsovga Bay after bighorn sheep, and on 
to Petropanlovsky and Anadyr to Cape Meech- 
ken after walrusses — the latter quest, however, 
meeting with no success. This part of Mr. 
Niedieck's book is marked by such a remarkable 
tale of things going awry that it makes uncom- 
monly good reading, for the author is not at all 
reluctant to lay the blame on other shoulders 
than his own. The second part of the book, 
which relates to Alaska, tells about the history 
and development of that land, its mythology, in- 
dustries (especially gold-mining) salmon-fishing 
and fox-breeding, and the manners and customs 
of the nations. The last part of the book tells 
the story of the author's adventures in the 
moose country. Though he makes lamentable 
moans for the continued mishaps that befell 
him during his seven months' trip in Siberia 
and Alaska, he may rest assured that his second 
book has gained such strength of structure and 
breadth of view that it is far superior to the 
rambling discursiveness of his first attempt. 

Mr. Harry A. Franck's unusually interesting 
volume, " A Vagabond Journey Around the 
World," is a venture in the field of those famous 
student-tramps, Flint and Wyckoff . After some 
varied experiences as a tramp in vacation-time, 
during his college days at Ann Arbor, he 
planned a two-years trip around the world, of 
which he says : 



" The chief object of investigation being the masses, 
I made no attempt during the journey to rise above the 
estate of the common laborer. My plan included no 
fixed itinerary. The details of route I left to chance 
and the exigencies of circumstances. Yet this random 
wandering brought me to as many famous spots as any 
victim of a • personally conducted ' tour could demand ; 
and, in addition, to many corners unknown to the regu- 
lar tourist " 

With but scant equipment of means for the 
journey, but with the merry heart and stout 
will that characterizes the true vagabond, the 
author made his way from Detroit to Glasgow 
by tending cattle ; earned his living in Mar- 
seilles as a stevedore and "handy man"; 
shipped as a sailor to Port Said, where he 
pounded beans for a living ; acted as interpre- 
ter, scribe, and guide in Beirut, and as a trans- 
lator in Jerusalem ; ran errands in Cairo ; played 
the circus clown in Colombo ; inspected the 
street-cars in Madras ; " fagged" on the tennis- 
courts at Delhi ; worked as a general laborer 
in Calcutta, Burma, Yokohama ; and made his 
way home as a sailor, and landed in Chicago as 
a cattle-tender. His conclusion is that " A 
man can girdle the globe without money, 
weapons, or baggage." Few books of travel 
will hold the reader's attention closer and set 
his emotions astir quicker than this one. 

Miss Mary H. Fee was one of the host of 
school-teachers who followed the flag into the 
Philippines ; but, unlike many of her associ- 
ates, she had the fortitude to remain there long 
enough to gather more than surface impressions. 
A decade of work in the islands, chiefly at Capiz 
and Manila, enabled her to gather sufficient 
interesting and instructive material to write her 
book of " A Woman's Impressions of the Philip- 
pines." Though Miss Fee has a goodly amount 
of humor — an excellent thing in a school-teacher 
— and plentifully sprinkles her volume with it 
in describing her ardent endeavors to engraft 
western civilization on the hybrid native stock, 
she dwells at length on the greater problems of 
the political, religious, social, and industrious 
conditions of the Filipinos. American readers 
generally, at this season of the year, will be ready 
to agree with Miss Fee that the future of the 
Philippines is more likely to be determined by 
the introduction of the great American game of 
base-ball than by the insistance that the Filipino 
youngsters should learn to sing " My Country 
'tis of Thee ' ' every morning ! Were old Fletcher 
of Saltoun to revise his statement, he might say, 
" Let me make the games of a nation, and I care 
not who makes its songs." But Miss Fee, after 
a furlough in America, is quite content that

the "hurry-up " ideas of her native land should 
remain there ; for she finds the Philippines a 
pleasing place — "a maSana country, a fair, 
sunny land, where rapid transportation and sky- 
scrapers do not exist." Her conclusion is, how- 
ever, that this fair land, now wavering between 
American domination and the growing national 
sentiment for independence, with the possibility 
of Japanese guns some fine morning awaken- 
ing the echoes of 1898 in Manila Bay, is in a 
very unenviable position. Miss Fee's volume 
adds nothing particularly new to our knowledge 
of the people of the Philippines, but it is not 
unworthy of having a place among the books 
pertaining to our foreign possessions. 

Very fittingly, Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine has 
dedicated his book entitled "The Ship-Dwellers" 
to "Mark Twain, Hero of my Childhood, In- 
spiration of my Youth, Friend of These Later 
Years." In his introductory chapter the author 
tells of the influence that Mark Twain's " In- 
nocents Abroad " exerted on his boyish imagi- 
nation, and how as he grew older he learned that 
the track of the Innocents might be a reality 
for him. This possibility was made a certainty 
one day when he heard that " the S. S. Grosser 
Kurfurst would set out on her cruise to the 
Orient with two tons of dressed chicken and four 
thousand bottles of champagne." The days at 
sea remind the author, and to some small extent 
the reader, of the days that the lamented author 
of the greater book spent in that questionable 
pleasure. Then we pass with Mr. Paine through 
his humorous account of his progress along the 
shores of the Mediterranean, to Algiers, Malta, 
Athens, into the Dardanelles, to Ephesus, into 
Syria, down to Damascus, following in the steps 
of the pilgrims of yesterday and to-day, to 
Jerusalem, thence to Egypt, and home again. 
When Mr. Paine writes of his personal experi- 
ences, and those of his companions, he is capitally 
diverting and original. The many pages of seri- 
ous matter in the book are uncommonly instruc- 
tive, so much so that we wish the author had 
not followed in his humorous master's tracks 
with such painfully short legs. 

" I am merely a reporter of impressions," is 
the remark written by Miss Grace Maxine 
Stein on the title-page of her book, " Glimpses 
Around the World through the Eyes of a Young 
American." When one starts from Chicago for 
a trip around the world via the Grand Canon 
of the Colorado, the Flowery KiDgdom, " The 
Core of Conservatism " [China], " The Pearl 
Drop in India's Brow " [Ceylon] , " The Cradle 



of Civilization " [Egypt], " The Land of Kings 
and Prophets" [Palestine], "The Garden of 
Europe " [Italy] , thence through a series of 
properly adjectived lands, back to " The Land 
of the Free and Home of the Brave," and when 
one with equal propriety fortifies oneself with 
fitting or fitful quotations from the world's 
great classics, then one may very rightly call 
one's observations impressions. Unkind persons 
may describe these impressions as gossipy ; while 
those who have a blunter way of putting things, 
but a more intelligent way of looking at them, 
may be inclined to associate the impressions 
with that cosmopolitan dish called " chop suey." 
For our part, we are disposed to apply that 
much overworked word, naive, to Miss Stein's 
impressions of the world as she saw it, — with 
the reservation that she makes no attempt to 
solve the world-problems as they presented 
themselves to her wondering eyes. If any reader 
of books of travel has never read a book about 
a trip around the world, he may as well begin 
with this one. It will introduce him to the 
facts and the fictions of the notable objects on 
the globe with sufficient accuracy and with a 
corresponding appeal to the emotions, so that 
he may continue to read more about the world 
without impaired mental indigestion. 

In the volume entitled " Our Search for a 
Wilderness " we find " an account of two orni- 
thological expeditions to Venezuela and to Brit- 
ish Guiana," by C. William Beebe, curator of 
ornithology in the New York Zoological Park, 
and his wife, Mary Blair Beebe, the grand- 
daughter of Roger A. Pryor. The first of these 
expeditions, made in 1908, was up the Orinoco 
Delta into the unknown mangrove jungles, 
thence to the great pitch-lake La Brea. In 
1909 these enthusiastic bird-hunters made three 
trips from Georgetown : one to Hoorie Creek in 
the northwest ; another on the Areniu and the 
Little Areniu in Central Guiana, and the third 
to the southern Savannas. More than three 
hundred and forty living birds, of sixty-five 
species, were captured and placed in the zoolog- 
ical collection. The authors carry something 
of the brilliant coloring of their tropical sur- 
roundings into their narrative. Their stories 
of the hunting ants, the wonderful butterflies, 
the talon-winged hoatzil bird of the mangrove 
wilderness, the song of the quadrille bird, the 
strutting of the curassow, the flight of the scar- 
let ibis, the penetrating cries of the wilderness of 
monkeys, and the multitude of things that make 
life a constant surprise in a land but little ex-

structiveness. 

" Up the Orinoco and down the Magdalena," 
by Dr. H. J. Mozans, is " the record of a jour- 
ney made to islands and lands that border the 
Caribbean and to the less frequented parts of 
Venezuela and Colombia.' ' Our general impres- 
sion is that South America is a land teeming 
with a variegated animal life ; but the author, 
after spending a year in the land, dissipates that 
impression into thin air. " Nowhere along the 
Orinoco, the Meta, the Magdalena, or elsewhere, 
did we ever catch even a glimpse of a jaguar 
or a puma, a manati or a sloth, a wild cat or a 
wild pig. More than this, not once during our 
entire trip through Venezuela and Colombia, 
through forests and plains, did we ever see a 
single monkey, except two or three that were 
kept as pets by the natives." The birds, too, 
which we have always imagined as clouding the 
sky, the author informs us are conspicuously 
absent. The uncommon interest of this book 
will cause its readers to desire to see the author's 
next volume, to be entitled " Along the Andes 
and down the Amazon," which is promised by 
Dr. Mozans in his preface. 

The journeys of Sir Francis Vane, recounted 
in his attractively printed book entitled "Walks 
and People in Tuscany," were a continuous tri- 
umphal procession " of quite the best sausages 
I have eaten." Seemingly, all out-of-the-way 
quaint old towns lost their picturesqueness un- 
less they accorded the author the welcome of 
Montemignajo : " We arrived there certainly 
as prepared to enjoy the pleasures of lunch as 
the more aesthetic pleasures of landscape." The 
twenty-five chapters of the book centre around 
Florence and Bagna di Lucca. Each chapter 
concludes with a short predigested account of 
roads and personally-tested inns. Practically 
all of Sir Francis's walks took him to little- 
known communities — to Tucecchio, the home- 
land of the Bonapartes ; to Ferrara, with its 
ideal castle ; to Montelupo, the place where 
the monster she-wolf (whence the name) once 
saved the inhabitants from destruction ; to San 
Martino, an imperium in imperio, the only 
existing example of a fourteenth century Italian 
republic; and to Turrite di Cava, with its pas- 
toral mystery play. Here and there in the 
book Sir Francis rises to the height of his sub- 
ject, especially when he points out some vivid 
contrast between the Old and the New Italy ; 



and he tells us much of interest about this 
secluded region little travelled and undefiled 
by tourists. 

Mr. George Kennan's " Tent-Life in Siberia " 
is now a classic in the literature of travel. 
First published in 1870, the work has since 
gone through many editions in the old familiar 
blue binding, until now it is reissued in a more 
befitting dress, with a new preface, new illus- 
trations, and some new subject-matter. This 
revised edition contains about fifteen thou- 
sand added words — " including ' Our Narrow- 
est Escape ' and ' The Aurora of the Sea,' and 
it also describes, for the first time, the incidents 
and adventures of a winter journey overland 
from the Okhotsh Sea to the Volga River — a 
straightaway sleighride of more than five thou- 
sand miles." The illustrations are from paint- 
ings made by Mr. George A. Frost, who was 
with Mr. Kennan on his expedition, and from 
photographs taken by Messrs. Jochelson and 
Borgoras, two Russian political exiles. If unique 
experiences by field and flood, unusual hard- 
ships in a detestable land, hazardous explorations 
among a strange people, and a keen apprecia- 
tion of the various natural scenery of Siberia, 
attract the present generation of readers of 
books of travel, then this new edition of an old 
favorite is worthy of its new dress. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson's book on "The Pic- 
turesque St. Lawrence " sets forth the story of 
the settlements along the great river, and details 
the historical settings that lend such an awe- 
inspiring aspect to the river from Lake Ontario 
to the Gulf, a distance of seven hundred miles. 
It is hardly necessary to add that Mr. Johnson's 
own illustrations greatly enhance the value 
and interest of the book, which is one of the 
excellent volumes in the " Picturesque River

Mr. Francis H. Alien, who was associated with Mr. 
Bradford Torrey in the editing of Thoreau's complete 
Journal, has brought together in a volume entitled 
" Notes on New England Birds " (Houghton J all of 
Thoreau's references to bird-life to be found in the 
fourteen volumes of the Journal. As Mr. Allen points 
out, Thoreau was a writer before all else, — a describer 
rather than an observer, one too intent on analogy to 
become a trained scientist; and so for scientific accur- 
acy we must go to other and duller writers. But 
we can never go elsewhere for the finer and rarer 
qualities that permeate his work. To have collected 
these scattered bird notes into a single compact vol- 
ume is a service for which nature-lovers should be 
grateful.

It is quite safe to say of Mr. Thurston's u Sally 
Bishop " that it is not a work to be recommended 
for the reading of the young person. The more 
difficult question of its fitness for the older person, 
presumably fortified by virtuous principle and knowl- 
edge of human wickedness, cannot be given so simple 
an answer. It belongs to a large class of books 
constructed upon a too familiar formula. A young 
woman sins, and discovers the consequences to be 
more serious than she had reckoned upon their be- 
coming. She is just weak enough to make the sin 
inevitable, the impelling circumstances being given ; 
and from the time of her lapse to the tragic ending, 
the writer's every effort is bent to the task of making 
her a sympathetic figure, and of weakening the props 
of our moral judgment. She is so good in most 
respects, and her seducer is so far from being a 
villain of melodrama, and the cry of her soul for 
happiness is so poignantly voiced, and the whole 
bewildering entanglement is set forth with such art- 
fully sentimental sophistry, that the most austere 
reader is in danger of being beguiled from his ad- 
herence to the elementary standards of conduct, and 
forced almost against his will to condone the woman's 
offence. This is the subtlest form of immorality, 
and its corrosive influence affects a large share of 
our modern fiction ; the present example is more 
notable than most others because of the unusual 
power which it displays in the analysis of motive 
and the portrayal of character. As far as most of the 
attributes of artistic fiction are concerned, it comes 
near to being a great novel ; but the canker is at its 
heart. Unless we are to take refuge in the com- 
fortable doctrine that there is no such thing as sin in

any absolute sense, and that the demand for expi- 
ation is a morbid self-delusion, we are bound to 
condemn the treatment given the theme in all such 
works as ''Sally Bishop," and to resent the effort to 
make us substitute sentimental for ethical standards 
in our theories of conduct It will doubtless be 
replied that all this is begging the question ; for our 
modern thinking is so permeated with hedonism that 
the very rocks of principle have become slippery, 
and all the categorical imperatives of old-fashioned 
morality are marks for the shafts of skepticism. 
But we are still confident that the marks are not 
as " easy " as they seem to their light-hearted assail- 
ants. 

We notice that Mr. H. G. Wells now classifies his 
works of fiction as " romances " and M novels." 
The former group includes all the wonderful inven- 
tions that have to do with Martians and lunar expe- 
ditions, and air-ships and comets, and fantastic 
biological imaginings. These works are romantic 
enough (in the sense of the romance of science), and 
they appear all the more so when contrasted with 
the smaller group, which makes us acquainted with 
Mr. Lewisham and Kipps, and the haughty Ann 
Veronica, and the hero of " Tono-Bungay," and the 
Mr. u Elfrid " Polly who now claims our attention. 
When Mr. Wells comes down to the plane of ordi- 
nary mortality, he seems to feel it his stern duty 
to depict for us types of depressing meanness 
and blatant vulgarity. No Bohemian of the Latin 
Quarter was ever quite so hard on the bourgeoisie 
as Mr. Wells is by habit and malice prepense. We 
presume this is a manifestation of the doctrinaire 
element in his writing, and that he thinks his 
socialist propaganda best served by filling us with 
contempt for man as he is actually shaped by the 
existing social pressure. Mr. Polly is perhaps the 
meanest of all his creations. A draper's assistant 
at first, then a small shopkeeper on his own account, 
married to a slattern, he becomes so disgusted with 
life that he attempts to escape from it by a combi- 
nation of arson with suicide. The latter does not 
come off, because his nerve fails him (he is going to 
do it with a razor); but the shop is burned up, and 
the insurance money collected from an unsuspecting 
company. He then deserts his wife ; and the rest 
of his story (as far as it is told us) is an Odyssey of 
vagabondage followed by an Iliad of warfare for 
the occupancy of a humble post as handy man in a 
rural tavern. All the figures in this tale are caric- 
atures, often highly amusing ones, but Mr. Wells is 
so much attached to the mannerisms of his invention 
that he worries them to death. It is amusing for a 
time to guess at Mr. Polly's meaning when he says 
" rockcocky," and " allitrition," and " altaelation," 
but it proves wearying in the long run. The author's 
humor is everywhere in evidence, and not all of it is 
of this low type ; but the smiles which it provokes 
are apt to be dreary. On the whole, we find less 
entertainment in this book than in the astronomical 
and biological fantasies.

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Mr. J. C. Snaith is a man of surprises. Each new 
book that he gives us is the exhibition of a new man- 
ner, and his accomplishment comprises the real or 
the romantic, the sordid or the ideal, the comic or 
the tragic, about as he pleases. His latest venture, 
called "'Fortune," is a study in the archaic picaresque, 
being concerned with the Spanish adventures of Sir 
Richard Pendragon, a valiant braggart whom we at 
first barely tolerate, but at last come to admire and 
almost to love. He suggests at times Don Quixote, 
Falstaff, Captain Fracasse, D'Artagnan, and Za- 
globa; and the setting-forth of his exploits is after 
the fashion of Mr. Maurice Hewlett as exemplified 
in " Richard Yea-and-Nay." The scene of this 
romance is the Spain of several centuries ago — a 
period not too exactly defined — and the interest 
increases steadily in joyousness from beginning to 
end. 

Mr. Harold Bindloss, in his " Thurston of Orchard 
Valley," gives us another novel constructed in accord- 
ance with his familiar formula. An Englishman, 
more or less unfortunate or handicapped at home, 
goes to the new world to build up his fortune. His 
goal is British Columbia ; and there he engages upon 
a struggle for the conquest of nature which arouses 
all his latent energies. His beginnings are of the 
humblest, and he encounters obstacles that would 
break a less determined spirit, but he overcomes 
them with undaunted energy. A heroine appears at 
the proper juncture, to provide him with inspiration. 
She is far above him socially, and has to struggle 
long and strenuously with her inherited ideals before 
she can admit, even to herself, that simple strength 
and sincerity of character outweigh all the external 
attributes of a man. In the end, of course, she yields 
sweetly and wholly, in the hour of her lover's dra- 
matic triumph over the hostility of nature and the 
villainy of man. Mr. Bindloss has told this story a 
dozen times before, but each time with an interest 
that makes it seem almost fresh. We should say 
that he has never told it more effectively than in 
this latest book, which is distinguished for fertility 
of invention and straightforward dramatic action. 
Thurston makes a very satisfactory hero, and his 
engineering exploits are difficult and daring enough 
to hold us fairly breathless. The author does not 
indulge in subtleties of analysis, and his characters 
are never deeply convincing in their psychology; but 
he has a feeling for nature that he knows how to 
make contagious, and an instinct for the picturesque. 
If the company to which he introduces us is made 
up of lay figures, it is at least an interesting society, — 
and it must not be forgotten that most of the people 
we meet in actual life are hardly more than lay 
figures in our consciousness. 

When we read Mrs. Humphry Ward's " Lady 
Merton, Colonist," we almost suspect that she has 
taken a lesson from Mr. Bindloss ; for she has given 
us essentially the same pair of lovers that his books 
acquaint us with, provides them with the same back- 
ground in the Canadian Northwest, and writes with 
the same glowing enthusiasm of man's struggle 



with nature on that outpost of civilization. That she 
has bettered the instruction in some respects, goes 
without saying, for her style always has something 
of the quality of distinction, and she sees deeper 
into characters than the facile psychology of Mr. 
Bindloss. Lady Merton is an aristocrat to the finger- 
tips, and George Anderson — the self-made and self- 
reliant colonial — is somewhat handicapped by being 
the son of a drunken reprobate ; but love finds a 
way — or, rather, Mrs. Ward finds a way for it — 
and the outcome is all that could be desired by the 
most sentimental of young women readers. The 
author has evidently been a good deal impressed by 
her Canadian journeyings, and it is also evident 
that the C. P. R. has seen to it that she should be im- 
pressed in the proper way ; her voice rises at times 
to a positive paean in praise of the new country, its 
possibilities and its enchantments. There has been 
nothing like it since Charles Eliot Norton came to 
Chicago, was personally-conducted to its sights, and 
proclaimed his discoveries to the world. It must 
be confessed that the literary fruits of Mrs. Ward's 
American travels are not exactly what we should 
have expected. The present example is almost as 
curious as its predecessor, which was heralded as a 
study of life in the United States, and turned out to 
be a tract on the divorce problem, with a Spanish- 
Irish lady for a heroine. We cannot say that either 
of the books has added materially to the author's 
reputation. 

It is evident that the colonial note is destined to 
be heard with increasing insistence in the chorus of 
British fiction. The self-consciousness and the senti- 
ment of local patriotism that are so rapidly develop- 
ing in the far-off lands that owe allegiance to the 
British crown are rapidly making their way into lit- 
erature, and are bringing with them a new coloring 
and a new imagery. This is all to the good; and 
the freshness of the new portrayals goes far to atone 
for what crudity they still exhibit. We may fitly 
link upon this occasion Miss Cynthia Stockley's 
"Poppy," a romance of South Africa, with Mrs. 
Ward's Canadian venture. Since Miss Schreiner 
first took us by storm, we have had nothing from 
South Africa more impressive than this vivid and 
glowing romance of an Irish waif blossoming into 
opulent womanhood under the skies of Natal. The 
story is immensely complicated, and will not bear 
summarizing; but it all centres about the heroine, 
who sinned and was not defiled, and for whose pure 
and passionate nature " a peace out of pain " was 
finally wrought by the mysterious agencies of des- 
tiny. So vital a creation is not often met with in 
the pages of fiction, and even the book of life does 
not frequently reveal a woman whose emotions are 
raised to so high a power. This superb central study 
is combined with many others, sharply-limned but 
kept in proper subordination, and with various pictur- 
esque and dramatic accessories which contribute to 
the total impressive effect. The book lacks some- 
thing in coherence and lucidity, but of its remarkable 
power there can be only one opinion.

" Nathan Burke," by Miss Mary S. Watts, is one 
of those novels which aim to give a cross-section of 
American life as it appears to the sympathetic 
observer in some carefully-chosen place and period. 
It is much the same sort of book as Mr. White's 
"A Certain Rich Man" — equally generous in 
dimensions and equally overloaded with details — 
but havingtheOhioof the forties for its scene, instead 
of the Kansas of a later half-century. It is also a 
book that reveals a great deal of minute historical 
knowledge and a remarkable power of characteriza- 
tion, besides being informed with a very wholesome 
idealism. Its hero is the Nathan Burke of the title, 
a backwoods youth when we first know him, then a 
resident of Columbus, where he passes through the 
stages of chore-boy. grocery-store clerk, and fledg- 
ling attorney ; then a volunteer soldier in the Mexi- 
can War ; and finally a battle-scarred veteran of 
about thirty returning to civil life. His story is 
unfolded in the most leisurely way, and he tells it 
himself from the vantage-point of his later years, 
although the narrative is mostly given in the third 
person. When he drops into the first person, as is 
now and then the case, the effect is a little confus- 
ing, for we are apt to fancy that the author is 
speaking on her own account upon these occasions. 
While the book is essentially a work of fiction, a 
great deal of actual history is imbedded within it, 
and many adroit touches are added for the purpose 
of making it seem like a real autobiography. The 
Mexican War scenes take up nearly half the book, 
and give us an intimate view of that inglorious 
episode in our history. Otherwise, the story is his- 
torical only in its faithful reproduction of the con- 
ditions of life in those early Western days — the 
social customs, the forms of speech, and the phases 
of political opinion. The characters offer a great 
variety of types, are sharply individualized, and 
are presented with a sympathy which embraces even 
the most despicable among them. It is life itself 
that the author gives us, rather than the artificial 
arrangements of life found in most novels ; her peo- 
ple are real people rather than the studies of virtue 
and villainy that we usually get. and that are so 
much easier to make. The story is doubtless too 
long-winded at times, but it is so human that we 
cannot complain seriously of its length. It is cer- 
tainly a remarkable product of the sympathetic 
imagination, and one of the surprises of the season, 
coming, as it does, from a writer hitherto almost 
unknown. 

The novels of Miss Mary Imlay Taylor always 
suffice for entertainment, and exhibit a constantly 
increasing skill in their construction. They give us 
familiar situations worked out upon familiar lines, 
and never worry us with problems or perplex us 
with casuistry. The familiar story told us in 
H Caleb Trench " is that of the man of the people 
who from humble beginnings makes his way to the 
esteem of the community in which his lot is cast, 
and to the heart of the young woman who is des- 
tined for him, but whose wealth and social position 



seem to set her too far apart for hope. We know, 
of course, that the chasm will be bridged, and that 
the haughty maiden's pride will be subdued ; we 
know also that the man will reach his goal by deeds 
of prowess, and will suffer discouragements that 
would break the resolution of almost any man not 
the hero of such a romance. The scene of these 
sentimental operations is a town in the South, some- 
where near the Mississippi ; and the plot makes a 
judicious mingling of political with private interests. 
The rival aspirant for the heroine's hand is clearly 
marked for defeat in the eyes of the practised 
reader, and the sum of villainies piled up against 
him is very satisfying. Seducer, embezzler, and 
murderer, he betakes himself to other scenes when 
the revelation is imminent, and Caleb, to whose 
charge most of the offences have been laid, eomes in 
on the home-stretch without a rival in sight. Inci 
dentally, he wins in the political game also, and 
sees a Republican governor elected in a hidebound 
Democratic Commonwealth. We should call this the 
best story that Miss Taylor has thus far produced. 

Neither the romance of American history nor the 
network of American parochial politics is given us 
in Winston Churchill's latest novel, but instead a 
study of the restless luxury-loving young woman of 
these later days, who drains the cup of pleasure 
until she makes the natural discovery that there 
are dregs at the bottom. The novel is called " A 
Modern Chronicle," and its heroine might quite 
properly be classified with the collection made for 
our edification in Mr. Herrick's " Together," while 
her environment is perhaps rather more suggestive 
of that which Mr. Chambers is wont to provide for 
those of his readers to whom the ways of " society " 
are always an object of alluring and envious inter 
est. Honora Leffingwell begins her life in Europe, 
although of American parentage; but she is orphaned 
when hardly beyond infancy, and transported to 
St. Louis, where she finds a home with Uncle Tom 
and Aunt Mary. It is a simple and charming home, 
sweetened by all the elements that enter into true 
human happiness ; but Honora has inherited worldly 
instincts, and she has glimpses of glittering things 
just beyond her reach that seem to her infinitely 
desirable. When she visits some wealthy friends in 
their summer home on the Hudson, she becomes so 
enamoured of luxurious living that she accepts, 
almost without reflection, the proposal of marriage 
made her by a commonplace stock-broker. His 
self-confident manner and general air of prosperity 
win him an easy victory, upon which follow the 
years of inevitable disillusionment. When Honora 
at last reaches the breaking-point, she obtains a 
divorce, and throws herself into the arms of a mas- 
terful Rochester sort of man, who takes her to his 
Virginia plantation to live. But his conservative 
family and neighbors have old-fashioned ideas of 
morality, and the couple find themselves practically 
ostracized. The husband thereupon develops a 
violent temper, and, one day seeking to work it off, 
is thrown from a vicious horse and instantly killed.

More dark years then follow for Honora, until, a 
chastened and ennobled woman, she accepts the 
devotion of Peter — simple, homely, faithful Peter 
— the childhood friend whose love has never failed 
her, and whom, had she possessed any discernment 
of character, she would have married in the begin- 
ning. The story is indeed " a modern chronicle," 
paralleled by countless examples in our age and 
country. Such women as Honora have a great deal 
to say about the individual's right to happiness, and 
do not understand, until taught by stern experience, 
that the only right recognized by the order of nature 
is the right to suffer the full consequences of impa- 
tient folly and a false perspective of the value of 
life. Mr. Churchill's heroine learns the lesson very 
thoroughly, and we leave her at the close with the 
belief that she will really profit by it. We think 
also that the author has shown himself fairly free 
from the fault of most novelists who deal with 
similar types and situations. He does not, in other 
words, permit judgment to become dissolved in sen- 
timent, nor does he coerce his readers into a sym- 
pathy, which makes the heroine appear to be more 
sinned against than sinning, more a victim of cir- 
cumstances than of her own unregulated will. For 
the rest, Mr. Churchill seems to have acquired a 
closer hold upon life than his romantic excursions 
have heretofore evidenced, and he has also improved 
in his literary technique, although his style is still 
far from achieving anything like distinction. 

" Predestined," which is described as " a novel 
of New York Life," is the work of Mr. Stephen 
French Whitman, a writer whose name we have not 
before seen upon a title-page. If it is a first novel, 
it is a surprisingly good one, — a portrayal of char- 
acter both vivid and penetrating, a study in realism 
shot through with poetic glints. Its hero is ironically 
named Felix, and his predestination is to become 
entangled with one woman after another, and with 
each new affair to sink lower in the scale of degrad- 
ation, becoming in the end a hopeless derelict. He 
is endowed with most of the graces and some of the 
virtues; but a fatal weakness preys like a canker 
upon the core of his being. In early manhood, he 
learns with a shock that the fortune he had supposed 
would come to him has disappeared, and that he 
must gain a livelihood by his own efforts. He wins 
the love of a beautiful and noble-hearted girl, who 
might have saved him from himself, but speedily 
forfeits her respect and his own happiness by a 
liaison with the wife of one of his friends. His 
next affair is with a " chorus lady " of mercenary 
instincts, who throws him over when she discovers 
that his castles are all in Spain. Then he is attracted 
by a faded and plaintive creature who has been 
abandoned by her husband. This time he actually 
marries, and drags out a miserable existence in her 
company until her death sets him free. There is 
not much more to relate; his progress to the gutter 
is now rapidly accelerated, and he dies a suicide. In 
outline, it is a gloomy enough story ; but in detail it 
seems less sombre, because the gloom is relieved by 



much cheerful incident, and by the sense of a life 
which is at least intensely lived, if with no high 
ultimate purpose in view. The hero's occupation 
(he is a journalist) gives a kaleidoscopic pattern to 
his career, and the promptings of his better nature 
keep him in close contact with our sympathies, 
despite the lamentable lack of self-restraint which 
is his undoing. We instinctively murmur, " Oh, the 
pity of it ! " when we come to the closing pages of 
this ill-starred record. 

California in the fifties — in the period when 
crime was rife, when the arm of the law seemed 
paralyzed, and when well-meaning citizens thought 
they were doing civilization a service by organized 
lawlessness — is the scene of " A Vigilante Girl," 
by Mr. Jerome Hart. The veteran editor knows his 
subject thoroughly, and exhibits a fair degree of 
accomplishment as a novelist, although it is only 
proper to say that his tale is more important in its 
instructive than in its constructive aspect. As a 
piece of fictive art, it is rather mechanical and dis- 
jointed ; but as a detailed reproduction of the life of 
a half century ago on the Pacific coast — the wild 
politics and the wild money-getting, the unbridled 
corruption and the untamed passion — it is vigorous 
and effective. We must say that the hero does not 
stir us to any very warm sympathy, but the heroine 
is quite satisfactory. She is called " a vigilante girl " 
because she at first defends the vigilante methods ; 
but she learns in the course of time to recognize in 
them a menace quite equal to that of the crime which 
they were designed to combat. This seems to be 
essentially the attitude of the author, and we cannot 
doubt that it is justified by a dispassionate historical 
survey of the whole unique situation. 

" The Isle of Whispers," wherewith Mr. E. Law- 
rence Dudley's ingenious romance is concerned, 
seems to be only a few miles out of Boston, but 
it is the headquarters of a gang of pirates whose 
methods are both original and entertaining. A 
young New York stockbroker is the hero, and his 
yacht is wrecked upon the island in the first chapter. 
The rascally inhabitants are ruled over by an aged 
reprobate who has a beautiful daughter. The new 
arrival falls in love with the girl (who is surprisingly 
innocent of the nefarious character of her father's 
enterprises), and accepts in pretended good faith the 
offer of a partnership in the pirate business. But he 
contrives to get word to the authorities, who make a 
descent upon the island, and obtain possession after 
a bloody scrimmage. The old man is killed, while 
the hero and heroine escape together, and land in 
New Bedford. It all makes a capital yarn, quite 
as plausible as we have any right to expect, and the 
excitement is not allowed to flag for a moment. 

The romantic novelist, casting about for a plot, 
may easily do worse than find one in the history of 
the revolutionary momement in Russia. Hardly 
any other available field offers such attractive possi- 
bilities for melodramatic effects, and a reasonably 
fresh story is almost always to be found in that 
quarter. We have read at least a hundred such 



1910.]

stories, and yet confess that "The Red Symbol," 
by Mr. John Ironside, proves vastly entertaining. 
It is based upon the happenings of the past five 
years, which serve to make it really fresh in the 
literal sense. The hero is a dashing American, and 
the heroine is — twins. These sisters are so much 
alike that the hero, although otherwise a person of 
much perspicacity, cannot tell them apart, and thus 
we are enabled in one chapter to mourn over the 
tragic death of the heroine, and in the next to 
make the pleasing discovery that she is alive and 
safe. The plot all hangs upon a mysterious secret 
organization, and has the usual concomitants of the 
chosen symbol, the midnight assassination, the 
tribunal which judges traitors, the accomplished 
spy. the gallant rescue, and all the rest. 

The romance of the air is clearly destined to rival 
the romance of the sea as a motive for the story of 
adventure. Among the pioneer uses that have 
already been made of it, " The Sky-Man," by Mr. 
Henry Kitchell Webster, is easily the most success- 
ful. So thrilling a tale, indeed, and one so good 
for boys of all ages, has not recently come within 
our reach. The hero, erstwhile an American officer 
in the Philippines, has been falsely charged with 
unbecoming conduct, has left the service in disgust, 
made himself an exile from civilization, and devoted 
himself so successfully to the art of flying that when 
the story opens he is disporting himself in the Arctic 
solitude, a true monarch of the kingdom of the air. 
He is cumbered with neither aeroplane nor dirigible, 
but simply straps on his wings (measuring a hun- 
dred feet from tip to tip), and makes something like 
a hundred miles an hour at his own sweet will. One 
day he becomes mixed up in a complicated situation 
in the northern wilds. The complication has three 
elements : the remnants of a polar expedition long 
given up for lost, a piratical crew, rescued by the 
survivors and afterwards treacherously turning 
against them, and a yachting company sent out in 
search of the lost explorers. In this latter party is 
the daughter of the lost leader of the original expe- 
dition, and thus a heroine is provided for our sky- 
man hero. These two are marooned for the winter 
on an ice-bound coast, and near them lurks all the 
while the pirate chief, seeking for an opportunity to 
destroy them, but for a time awed into inaction by 
his superstitious terror of the huge bird-like crea- 
ture that he occasionally sees hovering in the air. 
"When he discovers that this aerial monster is only 
a man with wings, he forces matters to a speedy 
conclusion, and is killed after a desperate struggle. 
Nothing now remains to be done but to provide a 
second rescue expedition for the two young people 
(now avowed lovers), and we leave them upon their 
return to civilization, having brought back with them 
a ship-load of gold. Every sort of romantic satis- 
faction is thus provided, and in liberal measure, by 
Mr. Webster, who has the merit of knowing how to 
write in addition to that of possessing an unusual 
fund of knowledge and inventive ingenuity.

Various Books for Summer Reading. 

ju. ■ f At a time when South Africa has 
a fisherman in served so conspicuously as a field for 
western water*. fa e hunter, the photographer, and 
the adventure-seeker, a book devoted to sport and 
travel in our own country comes as a novelty. Pro- 
fessor C. F. Holder's •' Recreations of a Sportsman 
on the Pacific Coast " (Putnam) is a welcome diver- 
sion in a home field. The author has fished in the 
deep seas of the Pacific and in the streams of the 
high Sierras and Cascades — has trailed swordfish 
in the waters off San Clemente Island in Southern 
California and moonfish off the Channel Islands 
near Santa Barbara, has " killed " salmon in the 
bay of Monterey and trout in the mountain streams 
of the whole Pacific coast, has " angled " in the 
crater of Mount Mazama and chased whale with a 
revolver. On many of his expeditions he has been 
accompanied by other noted sportsmen, among them 
Mr. Gifford Pinchot and Mr. Stewart Edward 
White. The frontispiece shows Mr. Pinchot and 
Mr. White trolling for swordfish in San Clemente 
Channel, an exciting account of which adventure is 
given by the author, who, in a small launch on a 
dead black night, aided Mr. Pinchot in his struggle 
with a swordfish weighing a hundred and eighty 
pounds. We quote a stirring passage : 

" The work cut out for Pinchot sitting in a skiff going at 
five miles an hour ; stern first, against a sea, in the dark, was 
to reel in a fish fighting mad or crazed by fear, that was 
anything from ten to twelve feet long. . . . Now I could 
see him dimly bracing to it, pumping with all his strength, 
gaining a foot to lose two, literally hauling the skiff up over 
the flying swordfish, and standing all the strain on the tip of 
his rod and his arms. That it was a good and hard fight, 
only those really know who have tried swordfish or tuna. 
The fish never rests ; he fights until he is dead, until the 
end. When you rest, he rests twice as fast, and to rest is to 
lose. . . . Suddenly I heard a shout of elation from Pinchot. 
' We 've got him alongside.' The wind was blowing a high 
sea and tossing us about. Before I knew it I saw Joe [the 
Mexican in the skiff with Pinchot] directly underneath us, 
and I nearly lifted that coughing, hiccoughing eight-horse- 
power engine out of the launch trying to back her away. 
But it was too late ; a big sea tossed me over, and they 
seemed to suddenly come at me out of the night. I did not 
hit the skiff, but I disconcerted Joe, who thought I was aboard 
of them, and he yelled, ' I 've lost him ! ' The gaff had slipped, 
or he had lost his hold, and there was a s ma s hing , rolling, 
surging, and bounding, choice talk in Spanish. Then came 
Pinchot's voice, ' I 've got him by the tail ! ' And so he had. 
He held the floundering swinging fish with grim desperation 
until Joe got a fresh hold, and a rope about him, and, as 
Pinchot told me later, he determined to ' hang to his fish if 
he went overboard.' " 

Besides being the most enthusiastic of sportsmen, Mr. 
Holder is a thorough man of science ; and thus the 
account of his recreations has a double interest. 
His attitude, too, is that of the born angler — that 
angling should be approached as an art, and results 
considered as incidents. Like the immortal Wal- 
ton, who "went fishing that he might commune 
with all the beautiful things of life and nature, 
sometimes forgetting his angling for echoes, the 
songs of birds and milkmaids," Mr. Holder finds 
interest in the quieter aspects of the game, and

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



devotes pages to descriptions of some of the most 
picturesque portions of the western coast. The 
illustrations are from photographs taken by the 
author and his friends, and are a decided addition. 

Trees and " Trees and Shrubs of the British 

tree-lore of Isles " is the title of the latest tree- 

Engiand. hook on our table. Messrs. Cooper 

and Westell of London are the authors, Mr. Newall 
is the artist, and Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the 
publishers. The work is in two rather sumptuous 
looking quarto volumes, with sixteen full-page col- 
ored plates, and seventy of the same dimensions in 
black and white, from Mr. Newall's drawings. 
The reader thinks at once of Sargent's monumental 
"Silva," with its half-thousand species and hundreds 
of lithographic plates ; but with such a work the 
present volumes do not at all invite comparison. 
Sargent's is a descriptive history, telling all that is 
known concerning each arboreal species; the present 
work is more in the style of a handbook designed for 
practical men and intended to be of every-day use 
to the lover of trees in the " green-walled garden." 
The opening sentence tells us that the work has been 
prepared to enable the reader to identify the trees 
of the British Isles, and to present much valuable 
information on such subjects as insects and fungoid 
pests, the more common galls, etc. Such a book, it 
would seem, should be offered in one volume, bound 
in oil-cloth or some similar fashion, that it might be 
of omnipresent service : we fear the smear of the 
gardener's thumb or the touch of rain-drops on these 
handsome covers. About half of the first volume is 
devoted to what may be esteemed " valuable inform- 
ation." This part of the work consists of a glossary, 
a list of M Latin roots " and Greek " root-words," a 
calendar to show the date of flowering for the listed 
species, an introduction full of " a number of things," 
and four chapters on insects, galls, and fungoid pests. 
The glossary descends to great detail of erudition, 
giving even the Saxon origin of English words; 
" acuminate " is cited among Latin roots, " latex " 
is derived from lac, and " paraphysis " from para 
and phyllon, etc. The chapters on plant-maladies 
and their remedies will be found serviceable; it 
may be noted in passing, however, that the Amer- 
ican gardener who would attempt to follow English 
prescription here must use kerosene where paraffin 
is cited. The descriptive pages follow the order of 
the older books, beginning with the crowfoots. There 
is no objection to this, but the text should be covered 
by some sort of a key that would enable the less ex- 
pert reader to name an unknown species or to find 
the description of familiar forms. As the matter 
stands, your ordinary gardener or reader can refer 
to a description only as he knows the name of what 
he seeks. The illustrations are generally excellent. 
The colored plates are three-color half-tones. The 
plates from drawings are striking in effect; they 
remind one of the old wood-cuts that made intelli- 
gible the lore of the herbalist and the botanies of 
long ago. In fine, these volumes, although primarily 



for English use, are of interest also in these western 
fields. Fully a fifth of the species described are 
North American plants ; and it will interest every 
lover of trees and every friend of out-door art to see to 
what extent the wild beauty of this newer world has 
been transplanted in its freshness to adorn and beau- 
tify still further the loveliest gardens of the world. 



Tending trees 



In Mr. B. E. Fernow's volume on 
a^KHL*, "The Care of Trees" (Holt) we may 

find lessons in a very practical sort 
of tree conservation. Here we are taught the care 
of individual trees, how to look out for our pets, the 
special favorites of park and street-side and lawn. 
We are told how to plant trees, how they must be 
trimmed and tended if they are to realize our higher 
sense of symmetry and dendritic beauty. Full in- 
formation is given relative to soils, tools, fertilizers, 
and repairs that go on either naturally or artificially ; 
for in these days there is " an art which does mend 
nature," an art which in this case is not nature, — 
"tree surgery" the gardeners name it, — an art by 
which to the " brotherhood of venerable trees " new 
life is given. One thing it seems the author here for- 
gets to urge : all our care and skill avail not unless 
we first select a proper tree. Trees of the same kind 
differ in habit, and for happiest ultimate attainment 
must be carefully selected. Half the present volume 
is given thus to arboriculture ; the remainder is a 
descriptive and well illustrated list of species suit- 
able for planting, with their advantages and disad- 
vantages in particular locations. The list of both 
trees and shrubs includes those suitable for every 
section of the eastern side of the continent. Many 
species are cited as " half-hardy " or " half-hardy as 
far as Ottawa." A half-hardy species is sooner or 
later wholly disappointing, and may as well be at 
once stricken from the category. A list of trees and 
shrubs perfectly hardy as far north as Ottawa or 
Chicago — and there is possibly such a list — might 
be brief, but would be extremely useful. The book 
is a convenient and valuable addition to our litera- 
ture concerning trees. It is more to be commended 
for matter than for manner. Our author speaks for 
himself on this point: "This book is not a sentimental 
effusion on the beauty and need of trees, but a com- 
pilation of information such as the owner of trees 
may be in search of."

necks, to the oyster-culturist in Narragansett, Chesa- 
peake, Mobile and Willapi Bays, and to the naturalist 
interested in the biology of mussels and their relatives 
the scallops, oysters, and clams. Professor Kellogg 
has succeeded admirably, however, in his volume 
on "Shell-Fish Industries" in Holt's "American 
Nature Series," in making an attractive and enter- 
taining book for all who are interested in these an- 
imals, whether as food or for industrial or scientific

purposes. The work deals with the structure, life 
history, and habits of the important shellfish used 
as food, and gives a rather full account of the oyster 
fields on the American coasts and of the methods of 
culture, capture, and marketing, in vogue both here 
and in Europe and Japan. The enemies of the oyster 
and means of combating them are discussed, and the 
relation which uncooked oysters and clams bear to 
the spread of typhoid fever is plainly set forth. The 
book also contains a number of original observations 
on the structure, physiology, and natural history of 
the oyster and clam, here published for the first time. 
The book is essentially an American work, and deals 
only with the principal edible mollusks of the East- 
ern Coast. The great part which the parcels post 
plays in the distribution of the enormous product of 
the French oyster-beds throughout Europe might 
well have been mentioned. One looks in vain for 
mention of periwinkles, abalone, or the delicious 
octopus of Naples which can at least claim relation- 
ship to the shellfish. Our great fresh-water clam-shell 
industries, the pearl fisheries and mother-of-pearl 
industries, are scarcely noted in the book. As with 
other natural resources of our bountiful country, we 
have wasted and exterminated our food supplies of 
our coasts, raked our oyster and clam beds bare, and, 
worst of all, we have ruthlessly fouled their waters 
with industrial wastes and sewage of our great cities. 
Fortunately, there are great stretches of coast, espe- 
cially in the south, well suited for the development of 
oyster culture under scientific methods, both profit- 
able and productive of a cheap and abundant food 
supply. To plant and reap and distribute this har- 
vest of the sea is the problem of the future. Pro- 
fessor Kellogg's book will help on the good work. 

Professor Harry Thurston Peck is 

iJSSS* » a ha ppy veiD < a vein of holida y 

jocularity touched now and then with 
amiable derision and good-humored sarcasm, in his 
latest collection of reprinted sketches. "The New 
Baedeker, being Casual Notes of an Irresponsible 
Traveller " (Dodd) possesses a pleasantly personal 
and engagingly anecdotal character which is at the 
furthest possible remove from the business-like curt- 
ness of Herr Baedeker's highly useful manuals. 
Nevertheless the book is dedicated to the pious 
memory of the Leipsic guide-book publisher, and is 
bound in the familiar Baedeker red cloth, but with- 
out the Baedeker maps and hotel lists and currency- 
tables and careful indexes. But the New Baedeker, 
unlike the old, is a book to read at home and for 
fun, not to be carried in hand by the neck-craning 
tourist " doing " three cathedrals and four art- 
galleries in a day. Both foreign and domestic travel 
are treated in the book. Part I. taking the reader to 
Havre and Trouville, Berlin, Rome, Rouen, Brussels. 
Malines, and Liverpool; and Part II. revealing the 
peculiar charms of our own Portland (Maine). Bos- 
ton, Lake Pleasant (Mass.), Utica (N. Y.), Trenton 
Falls, Atlantic City, and the " savage beauty " of 
the scenery on the Canadian Pacific Railway — all 



appropriately illustrated from photographs. That 
the book is no dry catalogue of things seen, that it is 
not at all an orthodox guide-book, we may prove con- 
clusively by ending this notice with a stanza from 
its author's metrical diversion at the close of his 
chapter on Rome. " Roma Recentiorum " is the 
title given to the poem, the third stanza of which 
trips it nimbly in the following manner : 

" Where Claudia mocked the rabble route 
And laughed its helpless rage to see, 
Now giggles as she flits about 

Some cheerful chit from Tennessee ; 
And where great Caesar passed in state 

And where Catullus kept his tryst, 
Now potters with uncertain gait 
The blear-eyed archaeologist.'" 



Another ''inveterate individualist," 

i n ^SL. M **: Geor g e Sylvester Viereck 
calls himself, has some opinions of 
his own to declare in a book of European impres- 
sions entitled " Confessions of a Barbarian." It is 
Germany especially that has inspired these journal- 
istic jottings, which are now gathered into a handy 
volume of two hundred pages. The author, a 
German-born American, has those impartially 
divided sympathies that fit one for depicting the 
peculiarities of one nation in a manner that shall 
amuse the readers of another while giving offense 
to neither. The positiveness of omniscient youth 
gives to his utterances no uncertain ring, and his 
short snappy sentences are an excellent antidote to 
summer drowsiness. Some of the questions which 
he takes up jauntily and settles conclusively in a 
few pages have to do with the morals of Europe, 
the character of the German Emperor, the intel- 
lectual drama, Gambrinus and Bacchus, inspired 
bureaucracy, and the philosophy of militarism. 
Youth and impressionability disport themselves in 
Mr. Viereck's pages, the writing of which must 
have been great fun for him, as we hope the reading 
will be to others. (Moffat, Yard & Co.) 

The little volume by Professor L. H. 

£££££*! B^' entiUed " The Mature-Study 
Idea" (Macmillan), brings us the 
latest word on this important topic. The idea of 
nature-study should be simple enough, one might 
think ; it ought to be plainly the study of Nature — 
the natural world. But the hyphenated title here 
stands for something different — something that 
would describe an educational effort of some years 
standing, designed to interest children and youth in 
Nature and her ways, all apart from the more formal 
presentments of science. The effort is really an 
outcome of the kindergarten movement, and was at 
first, and is yet in some places, the application of 
kindergarten methods to the investigation of more 
familiar natural objects. The attempt was in some 
instances unfortunate. Some of the nature-study 
text-books are downright nonsense. The play-idea 
involved in the kindergarten system, when carried 
into the fine movement of natural things, is apt to

degenerate into myth and foolishness. Professor 
Bailey would have us see the outside world just as 
it is, just as it lies before our unaided senses. His 
laboratory is the open field, and his nature-study is 
like that of Gilbert White, Thoreau, and Burroughs. 
We are carried away, in these days, by revelations 
of the microscope, and are in danger of losing that 
fine sympathetic appreciation of out-door objects 
which must ever lie at the basis of all true nature- 
study, and of true science as well ; for nature-study, 
in the right sense, may not traverse science. Nature- 
study need not be systematic. It does not especially 
care for the relations of things, except as these are 
related to the observer and claim his appreciation 
and love. Science is formal and severe; nature- 
study is natural and human, and should contribute 
directly to the interest and individual happiness of 
men. The present volume is really a revised edition 
of a valuable book published some years ago. Pro- 
fessor Bailey is indefatigable, and we have here not 
only much new matter but a thorough revision of 
the former text. The pages are full of suggestions 
born of wide and wise experience, and deserve care- 
ful reading by teachers and nature-lovers generally. 

Redolent of the odors of field and 

SZ.' fore8t and fl . ower - bed > and bright 
with the manifold colors wherewith 
nature adorns the earth, "A White-paper Garden," 
by Mrs. Sara Andrew Shafer, brings into the study 
as much, perhaps, of the glorious out-door world as 
it is in the power of pen and paper to transfer. Its 
qualities make their appeal, of course, not to the 
bodily senses, but to the finer perceptions of the 
mind and the imagination. "A garden for the 
garden-less " the writer calls her book, which she 
has designed especially for those country-bred city 
toilers who pine for a sight of the green fields and 
blossoming hedges of their childhood. " I will have 
a garden ! " she declares. " Reams of paper shall 
be my acreage, and pen and ink shall be my spade 
and trowel." The work is divided into twelve parts, 
one for each month of the year, and each combines 
description and reflection with seasonable horticul- 
tural advice. Twenty-eight illustrations, four of 
them colored, are provided, with the aid of the 
camera. It is a pleasing book, admirably conceived 
and lovingly executed. (A. C. McClurg & Co.) 

Mr. Frank Sherman Peer is a veteran 
tTeanano^a. ^ortsman, and "The Hunting Field 

with Horse and Hound" (Kennerley) 
is the second book he has written based on his 
experiences of cross-country runs here and abroad. 
He tells of fox-hunting in New and Old England, at 
the famous Meadowbrook and Old Rose Tree Hunts, 
in Virginia, in North Carolina by moonlight, in Scot- 
land, and in Ireland. He has pursued coyotes and 
jack rabbits in Colorado, stags with Lord Roths- 
child's pack, wild red deer in Devonshire, and wild 
boar at Baron de Dorlodot's French preserve. He 
has enjoyed milder sport with the foot beagles at 



Oxford and with the Essex otterhounds. His ex- 
periences are narrated in an easy, natural fashion, 
and the distinctive methods of each section are 
made prominent. Photographs of fine packs, big 
"meets," exciting runs, and distinguished masters of 
hounds, are supplemented by a few colored plates 
from spirited hunting pictures. 



Notes. 



" Morning Star " is the title of Mr. H. Rider Hag- 
gard's new romance, which the Messrs. Longman will 
publish immediately. 

The probable title of Mr. William de Morgan's next 
novel, which Messrs. Holt & Co. announce for early 
publication, will be " An Affair of Dishonour." 

Mr. James Oppenheim, whose " Dr. Rast " stories 
have been widely successful, has written a novel entitled 
" Wild Oats," which Mr. B. W. Huebsch will publish 
next month. 

Mr. Hilaire Belloc, the genial English M.P. who has 
already given us volumes " On Nothing " and " On 
Everything," will soon issue a new book called " On 
Anything." 

Mr. John Adams Thayer, who was a co-partner with 
Erman Ridgway in establishing " Everybody's Maga- 
zine," has written an account of his eventful business 
career, which Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. will pub- 
lish immediately. 

An authorized work on the life and times of King 
Edward was nearly completed at the time of the King's 
death, and will soon be published under the editorship 
of Sir Richard Holmes, the official biographer of Queen 
Victoria. 

A new book by Mr. Stanley Portal Hyatt, author of 
" The Little Brown Brother," is announced by the 
Dodge Publishing Co. Its title is "Biff el: A Trek 
Ox," and it has to do with the experiences of a South 
African draught ox. 

When toying with the phenomena which have become 
the stock in trade of the new mysticism, Bjornstjerne 
Bjornson wrote, about forty years ago, a little book 
called " Wise-Knut." Mr. Bernard Stahl has just put 
this story into English. 

Mr. Edmund Dulac, whose colored illustrations form 
a distinctive annual feature of the holiday season, is 
preparing for the coming Fall a series of paintings to 
illustrate " The Sleeping Beauty " and other old French 
fairy tales, as retold by A. T. Quiller Couch. 

On the same plan as her successful little book called 
" Science through Stories," Miss Constance M. Foot has 
prepared an account of " Insect Wonderland " (John 
Lane Co.), in which the essential facts of insect life are 
made attractive and intelligible to the youngest reader. 

The late Alexander Johnston's useful " History of 
American Politics " is to be still further enlarged for 
its fiftieth edition by Professor Winthrop More Daniels. 
He will continue the volume from the first administra- 
tion of McKinley to the inauguration of President Taft. 

Mr. Alfred Noyes, the young English poet, has writ- 
ten an imaginative verse drama, " The Forest of Wild 
Thyme," which Sir Herbert Tree is to produce in Lon- 
don and later in America. It is possible that Mr. 
Noyes will visit this country at the time of its presen- 
tation here.

The Japanese artist Yoshio Markino, whose charming 
interpretations of London, Rome, and Paris have 
attracted wide attention, has written an account of his 
interesting life, which Messrs. George W. Jacobs & 
Co. will publish soon under the title, "A Japanese 
Artist in London." 

It is announced that beginning with the July issue 
" The Forum " is to be published by Mr. Mitchell 
Kennerley of New York, though it will continue to be 
owned by the Forum Publishing Company, of which 
Mr. Isaac L. Rice has been the president since its for- 
mation twenty-four years ago. 

The Academy of Pacific Coast History publishes in 
pamphlet form Miguel Costanro's "Narrative of the 
Portola Expedition of 1769-1770," giving the text in 
both Spanish and in English translation. This publica- 
tion is edited by Messrs. Adolph van Hewert-Engert 
and Frederick J. Teggart, officers of the Academy. 

Volume V., Part 2, of Philip Schaff 's " History of 
the Christian Church " carries the chronicle to what may 
fairly be called the close of the Middle Ages — that is, 
to the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. This 
new volume of a monumental series is the work of Dr. 
David S. Schaff, and is published by the Messrs. Scribner. 

Mr. L. H. Bailey's " Manual of Gardening," lately 
issued by the Macmillan Co., is a combination and 
revision of the main parts of the same author's well- 
known " Garden-Making " and " Practical Garden- 
Book," together with much new material, the results 
of later experience. A better book in its field is not 
likely to appear for a long while. 

Mr. Horace Kephart, author of an authoritative 
manual on "Camping and Woodcraft," now issues 
through the Outing Publishing Company a little manual 
of " Camp Cookery," in which the camper-out of what- 
ever degree of experience or proficiency is likely to find 
many useful suggestions toward the enhancement of his 
alimentary welfare while in the woods. 

A new book by Mr. Ralph Waldo Trine, to be called 
"The Land of Living Men," will be brought out by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. in the early Fall. This 
author's books are having a very large circulation in 
Germany at the present time, and his " In Tune with 
the Infinite " is published in translation in eleven dif- 
ferent countries, while an edition in Esperanto is now 
being brought out in London. 

Miss Harriet L. Keeler, the author of two excellent 
handbooks on American trees and shrubs, now publishes 
through the Messrs. Scribner a popular study of " Our 
Garden Flowers," describing in detail their native lands, 
their life histories, and their structural affiliations. A 
profusion of well-executed illustrations in half-tone and 
line add to the usefulness of a volume which must be 
considered practically indispensable to the amateur 
gardener. 

Mr. W illiam Swan Sonnenschein's valuable reference 
work, " The Best Books," is soon to be issued in a new 
and revised edition by the Messrs. Putnam. All the 
matter in the old editions that remains of value has 
been retained; the characterizations have in many cases 
been changed, and much added, bringing the record 
of literature down to the end of 1909. The whole 
contents of the book will probably cover more than 
100,000 titles. 

Under the editorship of Professor Joseph Jastrow of 
the University of Wisconsin, Messrs. D. Appleton & 
Co. will publish a series of volumes intended to consider 



the several aspects of mental life of largest theoretical 
and practical interest, and to survey the ethical, social, 
and aesthetic aspects of human nature in relation to their 
origin, development, and influence. The books will be 
simple in treatment and will have a direct appeal to the 
general reader. Among the titles in preparation are 
" Psychology in Common Life," " Character and Tem- 
perament," and " The Health of the Mind." 

A bathchairman with a leaning toward literature is 
the unique discovery recently made by Mr. H. G. Wells. 
Under his encouragement, George Meek, who for nine- 
teen years has pushed and pulled a bath chair up and 
down the Parade at Eastbourne, has written an autobio- 
graphy whose naked simplicity and unaffected realism 
has attracted marked interest among the London review- 
ers. Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. will publish the book 
in this country. 

A blend of Epictetus, George Borrow, John Ruskin, 
and his own refreshing and underived self, appears in 
that finely conceived character, already familiar to 
readers of Mr. Maurice Hewlett's " Open Country," — 
John Maxwell Senhouse, whose " Letters to Sanchia " 
are now published by the Messrs. Scribner in a small 
volume extracted from " that true tale " above- 
mentioned. To have created such a character as Sen- 
house is to have lived and labored not in vain, and Mr. 
Hewlett has done his readers a favor by issuing this 
separate collection of his original utterances. 

Announcements of English fiction for the coming 
Fall season include, among others, the following titles: 
" The Creators " by Miss May Sinclair, " Mr. Ingle- 
side " by Mr. E. V. Lucas, " Clayhanger" by Mr. Arnold 
Bennett, " All the World Wondered " by Mr. Leonard 
Merrick, "Lady Good-for-Nothing " by Mr. A. T. 
Quiller Couch, "Panther's Cub" by Mr. and Mrs. 
Castle, " Rest Harrow " by Mr. Maurice Hewlett, " An 
Affair of Dishonour"by Mr. William de Morgan, "Second 
String " by Mr. Anthony Hope, " Daisy's Aunt " by 
Mr. E. F. Benson, and " The Golden Silence " by Mr. and 
Mrs. Williamson. It is safe to say that all these books 
will be published in this country also. 

The first number of " The Romanic Review " has 
made its appearance from the Columbia University 
Press. " A quarterly journal devoted to research . . . 
in the field of the early Romance languages and litera- 
ture," the new review proposes for itself a definitely 
limited field; and within the limits set, its work bids 
fair to be scholarly and valuable. One may object to 
the choice of " Romanic " instead of " Romance " in the 
title ; but, barbaric as it is, the Germanism is of course 
better fitted to indicate the philological character of the 
new periodical. H the promise of the table of contents 
is carried out as a definite policy, as would seem likely 
from a consideration of the choice of editors, we can 
only lament that the university attitude toward the 
Romance literatures is developing the same tenden- 
cies which have so largely helped to drive out Greek 
and Latin from our undergraduate curricula. Why 
should the cry of " dilettanteism " drive our scholars 
away from purely literary studies ? Why should we 
consider Moliere or Balzac less worthy of scholarly 
study than Raoul de Cambrai or the provenance of some 
forgotten Chanson de Geste f However, this perhaps is 
a minor objection. Romance scholarship in America 
has always been a bit self-conscious, and it is eminently 
fitting that it should become conscious of itself in a 
special review.

ragged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham

Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to me today, as when he was living. I would love so much to ,

REFRESHING SUMMER READING 



" A book of unfailing interest." — St. Louis Globe-Democrat. 

The Heart of Desire 

By ELIZABETH DEJEANS 

Author of " The Winning Chance." 
An intensely dramatic and absorbing novel of the instincts of womanhood — 
an analysis of a woman, human and appealing — the story pictured against 
a wonderful Southern California background. 

" There is color, vitality, and freshness in the picture, and charming variety of 
detail in the development of the story. Horton is the ideal lover, strong-hearted, 
wilful, persevering ; and Kate is the vivid, tantalizing, impersonal creature in an 
armor of secrecy. But the author transforms this woman into a being of rarest 
and most beautiful human qualities — or rather, brings those latent emotions to 
the fore." — Boston Evening Transcript. 

SECOND LARGE EDITION 
Three Colored Illustrations by The Kinneys. 



Routledge Rides Alone 

By WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT 

"Comfort has succeeded where Kipling failed. He has written a cons'stently 
dramatic, vigorous, and able novel, with a war correspondent as the hero, India 
and Manchuria in war time as the backgrounds, and a pervading element of Oriental 
mysticism in which East and West mingle. Moreover, he has woven into the book 
an appealing and distinguished love romance." — Philadelphia Press. 
SECOND LARGE EDITION 
Colored Frontispiece by Martin Justice. 



Raleigh 



A Spirited Romance 
of Elizabeth's Court 

By WM. DEVEREUX and STEPHEN LOVELL 
Founded upon their success'f ul play, « Sir Walter Raleigh," the hit of the 
1909-10 London theatrical season. 

" As a romance the story is entitled to rank with the best of Stanley Weyman's 
novels, while its historic worth is far greater." — Twentieth Century Magazine. 
With 8 Illustrations showing scenes from the Play.

The Silent Call 



jfiction 

By EDWIN MILTON ROYLE 

Illintrated. $1.50 

The story of the Squaw Man's son, by the author of the eminently success- 
ful drama. " The Squaw Man." 

The hero — Hal, the Squaw Man's son — is a half-breed, whose father was 
an Englishman of noble family. He was educated in the English schools and 
trained for the army, but when this noTel opens he has heard the " silent call" 
and is back near the ranch where he was born. 

But, beyond all, this is a love story, written with all the emotional 
intensity and delicate feeling that distinguished " The Squaw Man." 



Philippa at Halcyon By 



KATHARINE HOLLAND BROWN 

Illustrated. $1.50 

She has transferred to her pages the actual atmosphere of a girls' college — 
the very spirit of the girl undergraduates. Nowhere is so true and so charming 
an impression given of girls' college life. Upon the scene — a Western col- 
lege — are thrown varied girl characters who, with Philippa, herself a character 
of great fascination, pass through episodes exciting, interesting, and amusing. 



By FRANCIS LYNDE 
Illustrated. $1 50 



The Taming of Red Butte Western 

A Great Railroad Romance by a Former Railroad Man 
A Story of Vigor and Dash, of Love and Adventure 

" It is a tale bristling with action. Lidgerwood, Ford, Bradford, and Hal- 
lock are characters evidently drawn from life." — RochesterPost-Express. 

"An interest-gripping, well-told story of great power, as full of blood- 
quickening adventure as a fig is of seeds, runs between the margins of ' The 
Taming of Red Butte Western.' " — Boston Globe. 

"Always something is happening or just about to happen in Francis 
Lynde's story, ' The Taming of Red Butte Western,' and the reader's mind is 
held in interest or suspense to the end of the tale." — New York World. 

Danbury Rodd, Aviator B ' ""SZgilZ 

A Great Flying -Machine Story 

'" Rodd's native heath is the air, and the possibilities that lie not far ahead 
as suggested in these stories are full of thrill and charm." — Baltimore Xews. 

" From the first getting up into the space of the speedy aeroplane, Falcon. 
in the exhilarating novel, ' Danbury Rodd,' until the end of the last flight, 
more than 300 pages away, interest is as swift as the airship whose speed was 
close in touch with a mile a minute. It is one of Frederick Palmer's best 
stories." — Boston Globe. 

'' Danbury Rodd has so mastered the science of aerial navigation that he 
is king of the air. He takes chances that would daunt even the bravest of 
men, and the episode in which the young woman he loves risks her life in trying 
to save the lives of both is a most thrilling one." — Springfield Vnion.

THE NEW NOVEL 



"NATHAN BURKE" 

By MARY S. WATTS Cloth, $1.50 

Don't be discouraged by the length of " Nathan Burke." You will read and re-read 
many times every one of its 628 pages. What is more, your children and grand- 
children will also read them, and this can be said truly of few current popular novels. 

It is unfortunate that you should have been misled into buying many worthless 
novels by unscrupulous advertisements and still more unscrupulous so-called reviews. 
" Nathan Burke" is different. You will be glad that this advertisement induced 
you to buy it, and 

11 Nathan Burke" is published by The Macmillan Company, and our 
recommendation to you to buy it and read it means something even in these days 
when so many poor novels are widely advertised and exploited. 



"NATHAN BURKE." WHAT THE BEST CRITICS SAY 



"The longer we abide with her 
friendly group the more interesting 
they become and the more sorry are 
we to find the volume in our hand 
growing thicker on its left. However, 
one may always read again, and the 
reading again and yet again brings out 
subtle revelations, delicate nuances, at 
first unperceived. Especially does one 
appreciate more and more the quality 
of the humor, existing as a pervasive 
flavor, not a succession of flashes." 
— The New York Times. 

"'Nathan Burke' has a universal 
appeal." — New York American. 

" Extraordinarily worth while." 

— Record-Herald. 



Only once in a decade, says the 
Boston Transcript, is a new novel 
added to the list of those " destined 
to endure." "In the enthusiasm 
aroused by the first reading of ' Nathan 
Burke,' one is inclined to extravagance 
of praise. Here is a novel so sound, 
so rilled with much that has inspired 
the great novels, that it is hard to 
maintain moderate standards of com- 
parison." 

The Outlook finds that it responds 
well to the only test for this kind of 
writing, that " the interest continues 
throughout, increasing rather than 
abating as the story slowly unfolds."

NATHAN BURKE"

of promise indicative of better things to come, 
and even to chronicle now and then the actual 
accomplishment of something that is really 
worth doing in the theatrical field. Such a 
promise was held out to us when the New 
Theatre was projected in New York ; and such 
an accomplishment has now become, with the 
close of the first season of that enterprise, a 
matter of recorded history. The enterprise had 
much to contend with in the way of suspicion, 
cynicism, and the scarcely- veiled antagonism of 
the interests that are well content with things 
theatrical as they are. It was scoffed at as a 
" highbrow " venture, and that label offers much 
opportunity for cheap derision. It was despaired 
of as something too good for the depraved pub- 
lic of this wicked world, and the analogy of 
certain earlier ventures in idealism seemed to 
deny it the hope of enduring success. It was 
decried from the seats of the mighty who take 
counsel together in the " syndicate " and who 
have substituted commercialism for art in nine- 
tenths of our playhouses. Nevertheless, it 
persevered in its quixotic undertaking, built 
and opened its playhouse, collected and trained 
its company, and has now shamed the tongues 
of incredulity and malice by a completed season 
of artistic effort that has surpassed the expecta- 
tions even of its friends. 

This first season has been to some extent 
experimental, and of necessity, for it had pio- 
neer work to do, and standards had to be created, 
or at least pieced together out of lapsed memories 
of the past and of suggestions from other coun- 
tries which take the stage seriously as one of 
the chief instrumentalities of culture. There 
were some mistakes, such as the building of too 
large an auditorium, the initial toying with 
stellar attractions, the ill-advised inclusion of 
operatic performances in its programme, and 
the occasional selection of an unworthy play. 
But these mistakes were not fatal, for they 
admitted of obvious remedies, and the manage- 
ment has been quick to realize them and to profit 
by the experience. On the other side of the 



412 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



account, there is the solid achievement of a long 
season quite successful from the box-office stand- 
point, and highly satisfactory from the stand- 
point of observers who are mainly concerned 
with artistic and cultural aims. 

At the close of the New York season about a 
month ago, the Company set out on a mission- 
ary expedition to a few selected cities, the most 
important of them being Chicago. It is too 
expensive an organization to expect to pay for 
itself upon such a tour, and the management 
made a generous appropriation to meet the 
deficit. In other words, it decided to give to a 
few favored cities an object-lesson in the sub- 
sidized theatre that has often been advocated, 
but that has seen small prospect of becoming 
realized in this country. The fortnight allotted 
to Chicago has falsified a good deal of pessimistic 
prophesying, and has opened many eyes to the 
fact that conscientious art is not the least among 
the attractions that may draw audiences into 
theatres. In brief, the eighteen performances 
given in Chicago have been presented in most 
cases to " capacity " houses, and great numbers 
of visitors have been turned from the doors for 
the simple reason that there were no more seats 
to sell. No other success equal to this has been 
achieved in Chicago during the past season, 
and it is pleasant to think that for once the 
most successful enterprise has been also the 
most meritorious. 

Seven plays were given an average of three 
performances each during the Chicago engage- 
ment. Of these plays, three were approved 
classics — Shakespeare being represented by 
" Twelfth Night" and "A Winter's Tale," and 
Sheridan by " The School for Scandal." The 
two Shakespearian performances were made the 
occasion of an interesting contrast in method, 
since the former was given with the usual modern 
accessories, while the latter was given " in the 
Elizabethan manner," which means without 
change of scene. There is something to be said 
for the archaic mode of representation, but we 
imagine that Shakespeare himself would have 
welcomed many of our modern appliances, and 
that the bareness of the Globe performances was 
rather a matter of necessity than of set deter- 
mination. The ideal setting for a play of Shake- 
speare in our day is one that spares nothing 
likely to make the action intelligible, and per- 
mits nothing likely to distract attention from 
either the action or the thought. For the rest, 
it was a pleasure to witness a " Twelfth Night " 
which was something more than the exploitation 
of a Viola or a Malvolio, "A Winter's Tale" 



which was something more than series of stage- 
pictures grouped about a Hermione. Likewise, 
it was a great satisfaction to witness a "School 
for Scandal " in which Lady Teazle took her 
proper place and did not always read her 
lines from the centre of the stage. With this 
comedy, and with " The Rivals," it is going to 
take us a long while to forget Ada Rehan and 
Joseph Jefferson ; but it must be admitted 
that they put the works considerably out of 
balance. 

Of the modern plays included in the fort- 
night's repertory, the triumph was scored by 
Maeterlinck's " Sister Beatrice." We have 
rarely seen upon the stage anything as lovely 
and as appealing. It was at once the embodi- 
ment of the most exquisite poetry and of the 
most delicate spirituality, besides delighting the 
eye with a color-scheme of enchanting beauty. 
In the production of such a work as this, a 
theatre becomes a temple, and a play-goer a 
worshipper. Since " Sister Beatrice " is a short 
piece, it had to be coupled with something else 
to fill out the evening ; and its pendant was Mr. 
Besier's " Don," a comedy that is serious as well 
as amusing. The two remaining offerings of the 
engagement were " Strife " and " The Nigger." 
Mr. Galsworthy's " Strife " is the work of a 
writer intensely in earnest, with an extraordinary 
power to make us feel the poignancy of suffering, 
and to arouse our social sympathies. Although 
its spirit is that of a sermon, it proved dramat- 
ically effective. Mr. Sheldon's " The Nigger " 
is interesting as the work of a very young man, 
and is a thoroughly honest composition. • It 
comes a little too near to melodrama in its situa- 
tions, and its gloom is unrelieved. But it is a 
work of promise, and we anticipate with interest 
the play that this young writer is likely to give 
us when he shall have more suitable material to 
deal with. 

Such is the varied selection of plays by which 
Chicago has been permitted to judge of the 
New Theatre and its significance. The judg- 
ment has been so favorable, and the support 
accorded so hearty, that the company will 
undoubtedly include this city in all its future 
plans. The season has brought home to us the 
lesson of what was lost when the stock company 
ceased to occupy an important position in our 
theatrical world, and has aroused in several 
thousands of people a determination to work 
for a restoration of the older and better order 
of things. It has been so much the most sat- 
isfactory of the year's theatrical happenings 
that the " star system " and the " long run " 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

have been clearly shown to be comparatively 
indefensible. It has proved to us the immense 
advantage of measure and balance and good 
taste over emphasis and distortion and meretri- 
cious display. 



GOLD WIN SMITH. 



A ripe scholar, a sane and sagacious observer of 
the activities of men, and a wise counsellor upon the 
deeper problems of the political, social, and intel- 
lectual life, passed away in Toronto on the seventh 
of this month. Goldwin Smith was eighty-six years 
of age, and for the nearly forty years of his resi- 
dence in the Dominion has been easily the most 
distinguished of Canadians. Coming to America 
for permanent residence at the age of forty-five, he 
brought with him a brilliant reputation as a student 
of history and political science. For eight years he 
had been Regius Professor of modern history at 
Oxford, and had published something like a dozen 
volumes. He had also identified himself with the 
group of liberal leaders, among whom Mill and 
Bright were numbered, who realized the underlying 
causes of our Civil War, and championed the Federal 
government in its struggle to preserve the Union. 
It was in 1871 that he settled down in Toronto, 
soon after to be happily married, and to make 
"The Grange " a kind of Mecca for statesmen and 
scholars. Since then, more than a score of books 
have come from his pen, besides countless contribu- 
tions to periodical literature. Some of his books 
are of the sort that serve their purpose and no longer 
need to be read, but many of them are works of 
lasting value — profound discussions of the philoso- 
phy of history, keen studies in literary criticism, 
and wise reflections upon the riddle of existence. 
Goldwin Smith was, like Mill and Leslie Stephen, a 
convinced exponent of the supreme authority of rea- 
son in all intellectual concerns ; and the truth, even 
if it might seem chilling, was to him more desir- 
able than the comforting delusions with which many 
men are content. '-Individual freedom, national 
independence, and the reign of justice, universal 
peace, and the happiness of the masses of mankind, 
are the ends for which this publicist has consistently 
striven, with voice and pen alike, in England and 
on the American continent " — this is a summing- 
up by President Schurman. It is impressive to 
think that the great Englishman now dead has lived 
under five sovereigns, and that he once " talked with 
a man who talked to the man who was premier of 
England in 1801 — to Addington about Pitt." He 
remembered the Reform Bill, the destruction of 
threshing machines by an angry peasantry, the time 
when fires were lighted by tinder, when the curfew 
was heard, and when men were put in the stocks. 
His death has srtapped one of the few remaining 
links between that remote past and the twentieth 
century. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A BRILLIANT LITERARY BLUNDER has just made 

its appeal for immortality in the columns of a current 
newspaper, in connection with the celebration of the 
hundreth anniversary of Margaret Fuller's birth, 
May 23. The reports of her death by shipwreck, sixty 
years ago, when nearing New York harbor, have 
always seemed harrowing, and it is a relief to hear 
that the accepted narrative is "all a mistake" — that 
she is still alive, and well enough to join in the cele- 
bration of her own centennial, at her birthplace in 
Cambridgeport, Mass. The newspaper referred to 
printed in its issue of May 24 an article headed, 
" Countess d'Ossoli is 100 years old." It read, in all 
seriousness, as follows : " Margaret Fuller, Countess 
d'Ossoli, observed the 100th anniversary of her birth 
yesterday at her home, 71 Cherry street, Cambridge. 
Addresses were made by the Rev. Woodman Brad- 
bury, Miss Edith Fuller, and Miss Megraw. Music 
was rendered by Miss Harriet Wescott, Mrs. A. H. 
Richards, Miss Ella M. Chamberlain, and Miss 
Sarah F. Rainlet. Miss Fuller was married many 
years ago to the Marquis d'Ossoli of Italy, when she 
was working for Italian liberty. She was a fellow- 
pupil of Holmes and Richard Henry Dana, and a 
friend of Emerson. She was the only woman promi- 
nently identified with the transcendental movement 
and the Brook Farm community. Hawthorne pic- 
tured her as Zenobia in his ' Blithedale Romance.' " 
This charming story appeared, not in some "raw 
country weekly " in Arkansas or Arizona, but in a 
prominent morning journal of Boston. This fact 
might incite to comment; but we give, instead, a 
quotation. It is from a well-known literary woman 
of that city. " A few weeks ago," she writes, " we 
had a literary pow-wow at our Boston Authors' Club, 
and pointed out our sad need in this country of the 
best criticism, and of journals voicing the same. 
And we gave thanks, in closing, for Chicago and 
The Dial." Chicago and The Dial ! — and liter- 
ary Boston giving thanks for these ! How strange it 
seems, and new ! 

The untimely end of " O. Henry," short-story 
writer and master of a mirth-provoking style that 
was as vigorous and untrammelled as an unbroken 
Texas steer, brings sincere regret to thousands of 
readers. William Sidney Porter, as he was known 
outside the world of literature, was a native of 
Greensboro, North Carolina, where he was born in 
1867. Ranch life in Texas, journalism in Houston, 
banana-raising in Central America, and short story 
writing in New Orleans and New York, — these 
were a few of the varied activities in which the rest- 
less young man engaged, finding his place at last in 
the pages of the popular monthlies, which were glad 
to pay him as much as $750 and $1000 apiece for 
his tales. Although he has written voluminously of 
Western life in exhilarating English redolent of the 
prairie and untraversed places, it is essentially in 
his portrayals of New York life that his fame most 



414 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



securely rests. The field of the Tenderloin he made 
his own ; and his characterizations of its types — 
the chorus girl " artiste "; the shop-girl of the alluring 
pompadour ; the stenographer, i. e., "a picture-hat 
and a piece of pineapple chewing-gum "; the park- 
bench loafer with his fear of the " cops " and his 
regular place in the " bread-row "; the Tammany 
boss of the big diamonds and the fat cigar ; the 
" John Doe " who " sits to have his shoes polished 
within sound of a bowling-alley, and bears some- 
where about him turquoises " — all these stand out 
in his gallery of portraits with never-to-be-forgotten 
vividness. While some of his later work has obvi- 
ously suffered in the interests of commercialism, yet 
at his best — in the collections which comprise " The 
Four Million," " The Trimmed Lamp," and " The 
Voice of the City " — he has been named, not 
unworthily, in the same breath with Maupassant 
and Kipling as an artist in short-story writing. 

A SUPERFLUOUS FUNCTIONARY IN THE DRAMATIC 

world is a "literary director," if we may judge by 
the experiences of the New Theatre in New York, 
as set forth by the discouraged functionary himself 
in the June number of " The World's Work." Out 
of three thousand MS. plays submitted to the New 
Theatre, only three seemed to him worth accepting. 
This showing is so little inspiring as to the future 
of play-writing in America that he appears to have 
thrown up his job in disgust: a not irrational pro- 
cedure, since there can be no pressing need of a 
" literary director " when there is nothing literary 
to direct. While one can hardly wonder at this 
reader's pessimistic attitude regarding the output of 
our native playwrights, yet there might be other 
ways of accounting for what to him seems " an 
unmitigated staggerer." In the view of the rejected 
playwrights, the trouble might be with the " liter- 
ary director" himself; they might believe, in all 
sincerity, that he did not know a good play when 
he saw it. But that could hardly be regarded as an 
unbiassed judgment. A more reasonable explana- 
tion we suspect might be found in the number of 
old plays submitted — the number of would-be dra- 
matists who furbished up their oft-rejected and dilap- 
idated manuscripts and offered them to the New 
Theatre whose vaunted feature of u endowment " 
made it a shining mark for them. If theatres are 
to be endowed, why not playwrights as well ? And 
if subsidies are going round in the theatrical world, 
why should they not be shared by the children of 
gifts and grace who furnish the plays without which 
the theatre, New or Old, would be but empty walls ? 
"Let us furnish the plays for the people," they 
might say, " and we care not who pays the bills for 
their production." 

Mrs. Howe at ninety-one is a most interesting 
and venerable figure. While her fame with pos- 
terity will rest largely on her " Battle Hymn of the 
Republic" (in spite of its author's conscious and 
unconscious advocacy of universal peace and good- 



will), her wide range of talents and sympathies will 
not be forgotten. As a graceful and winning plat- 
form speaker, able to address her audience, if need 
be, in other tongues than her own, and as the friend 
and promoter of many worthy causes, she has 
stamped the impress of her personality on her age 
and generation. As a late example of her still 
active participation in matters of public concern, it 
is interesting to note her appearance lately before a 
legislative committee to plead the cause of pure 
milk for Boston, where, as in many other places, 
the laws for protecting the community from the 
dangers of adulterated or diluted milk are much too 
laxly enforced. Fortunate indeed is Boston, the 
home of many noble women, to have in these days 
— as it is to be hoped she will have for some years 
to come — this one of the noblest of them all. Mrs. 
Howe is almost the same age as that other remark- 
able woman, " the mother of women's clubs " in 
America, Mrs. Caroline Severance, once of Boston, 
but now living in Los Angeles, California, where, 
like Mrs. Howe, she is still actively interested in 
whatever concerns the welfare of the community or 
the nation. 

The centennial of the "Learned Black- 
smith," as Elihu Burritt was commonly called, has 
had its celebration some months in advance of his 
hundredth birthday, which falls on the eighth of 
next December. The New England Peace Con- 
gress, sitting at Hartford and New Britain, Conn., 
on the tenth of May, paid appropriate tribute to the 
memory of the man who conducted the first Ameri- 
can newspaper ("The Christian Citizen") that 
devoted considerable space to the cause of universal 
peace, and who also originated the " Olive Leaf 
Mission," a monthly issue of printed slips, headed 
by a dove with an olive leaf in its bill, that were 
sent out to hundreds of newspapers for insertion. 
Among the many other reforms claiming Burritt's 
more or less active interest was the scheme of an 
ocean penny-postage to promote international corre- 
spondence, and so, indirectly, international peace. 
This was in 1847, sixty-two years before the slow 
world showed itself ready for such a beneficent 
innovation. Anti-slavery, temperance, self-culture, 
and other good causes, were also advocated in " The 
Christian Citizen," and the sufferings of Ireland in 
the famine of 1847 called its editor to the Emerald 
Isle and formed the subject of a pamphlet written 
by him and widely circulated. " The Citizen of the 
World," an anti-slavery journal, was a few years 
later taken charge of by him in Philadelphia. 
Besides editorial labors he wrote more than thirty 
books and pamphlets of a philanthropic or instruc- 
tive character, among which may be mentioned 
" Sparks from the Anvil," " Walks from London 
to Land's End and Back," " Peace Papers for the 
People," and " Ten-Minute Talks on All Sorts of 
Subjects, with Autobiography." "Of his early thirst 
for knowledge, especially linguistic, and his way of 
economizing the odds and ends of time for its acqui-

sition, everyone has heard and read considerable. 
His Autobiography is the authoritative source of 
our information under that head. But like many 
men of great acquisitive powers and wonderful 
memory. Burritt possessed no great originality of 
thought, and his title to fame rests on his philan- 
thropic labors rather than on his wide learning and 
his mastery of many tongues.

Dr. William Gordon-Stables, surgeon, trav- 
eller, and author, has written the last of his many 
popular books. Death claimed him last month, at 
the age of seventy years and a few days. His fer- 
tile brain and his well-stored memory of personal 
adventures in many lands and on many seas fur- 
nished him with material for a hundred and fifty 
volumes of vivid description and narrative and 
varied invention, many of his books being written 
for and well liked by boys. Born in Banffshire, he 
studied medicine at Aberdeen University, and while 
still but a youth he shipped as surgeon on a small 
whaling brig bound for the Arctic regions. A false 
report of the loss of the vessel with all on board pre- 
ceded his home-coming, so that when he presented 
himself at his father's door he was met by father 
and sister both dressed in deep mourning. '• "Which 
of the family is dead?" he inquired anxious'y. 
*• Why, you are," was the reply. Nine years of 
service in the navy then followed, and still another 
voyage to the frozen zone. Among his books a 
few of the best^known are " From Pole to Pole," 
•• Every Inch a Sailor." " A Girl from the States," 
" The Rose of Allandale," " Frank Hardinge," 
"Cycling for Health," and "Tea: the Drink of 
Pleasure and of Health." In " Who's Who" it is 
recorded that his recreations were " curling, swim- 
ming, caravan touring all summer, and music," and 
that he was a member of the Humanitarian League 
and Wandering Secretary to the Sea Birds Pro- 
tection Society. In the caravan that formed his 
summer home many of his books were written. 

The dedication of the Smith College 
Library, the fine building to procure which Presi- 
dent Seelye and the graduates and friends of the 
college have been putting forth strenuous efforts for 
more than a decade, took place on the twenty- 
seventh of last month, and was made memorable by 
a gathering of many distinguished guests and by the 
meeting of the New England College Librarians' 
Association. This latter body convened in the morn- 
ing and did what it could to promote the intellectual 
regeneration of man by discussing such questions 
as " How Shall We Encourage Cultural Reading?" 
and a Is it Advisable for Colleges to Print Lists for 
Summer Reading?" and "The Relation of Required 
Reading to the Capacity of Undergraduate Stu- 
dents," and " Methods of Filing Newspaper Clip- 
pings, Extracts, etc." At the dedication exercises 
in the afternoon, President Seelye gave the history 



of the development of the Smith College Library 
from the time it occupied what is now the Regis- 
trar's office to its removal into its present stately 
quarters. The orator of the day was Dr. W. Dawson 
Johnston, Librarian of Columbia University, who 
spoke on ''Academic Ideals in Library Administra- 
tion," and emphasized the indispensability of trained 
and educated librarians to minister to the literary 
wants of college students. Miss Josephine A. Clark, 
the college Librarian, called attention to the need of 
an endowment fund of at least a hundred thousand 
dollars for the proper development of the library 
now so handsomely provided with a home. 

The resources of the reference depart- 
ment of the well-equipped public library are ac- 
quiring dimensions that will ere long merit the 
adjective ''vast." General and technical cyclopae- 
dias, biographical dictionaries of the living and of 
the dead, concordances and other literary aids, lexi- 
cons in increasing size, atlases of growing bulk, — 
these and many other kinds of helps to the studious 
and the curious are being produced with that plod- 
ding, untiring industry which has hitherto been 
regarded as preeminently characteristic of German 
scholarship. With the daily increasing number of 
special departments of learning and research, what 
will be the aspect of the reference room of a cen- 
tury hence ? Already the complaint reaches us from 
the Providence Public Library that this department 
is there suffering from acute congestion. More 
than thirteen hundred volumes of reference books, 
writes Mr. Foster in his current Report, have been 
crowded out of the reference room to more or less 
distant parts of the building. But there is a pros- 
pect of ampler quarters, sometime. Dictionaries 
and encyclopaedias and similar works take up a great 
amount of shelf-room, but they are indispensable. 

Ten million dollars for book-shelter, ex- 
pended on a single building, cannot but seem a 
regrettably lavish outlay on externals. If we esti- 
mate the average cost of standard works in all 
departments of literature at two dollars a volume 
(a rather high estimate), we find that with this 
immense sum spent, or soon to be spent, on the 
great building in Bryant Square known as the New 
York Public Library, a thousand collections of five 
thousand volumes each could be bought. A thou- 
sand small towns throughout our country could 
thus be provided with much-needed reading matter, 
in a sufficient quantity, for what has gone, in ways 
known to those who have studied the history of 
public buildings in this land of the politician and 
home of the grafter, to keep the wind and the 
weather from a single collection of public-library 
books. The first estimate of two and one-half mil- 
lion dollars as the probable cost of a structure worthy 
to serve as a central library for our metropolis was 
certainly a generous one ; and yet already nearly

four times that amount has been expended, and the 
end is not yet. Sometime in 1911 — thirteen years 
after work began in preparing the ground for the 
new building — its doors will probably be opened, 
and the public will see something more than the 
now long-familiar exterior of this monument to mu- 
nicipal extravagance and interminable red tape. 
• • • 
Poetry as a by-product of plodding toil in the 
least poetical of trades and callings fills a larger 
place in literature, especially current literature, than 
might be imagined. A London literary letter calls 
attention to the number of English verse-writers 
who are workingmen in the humbler walks of life. 
Although Mr. William H. Davies, whose " Farewell 
to Poesy " has lately appeared, apparently prefers 
to be known as a tramp, there is Mr. James Dryden 
Hosken, postman in Cornwall, occasional supernum- 
erary on the stage, one-time custom-house employee, 
and at present doing extra duty as librarian and 
secretary of a small religious establishment in his 
county. He was u discovered " by Mr. Quiller-Couch, 
and is the author of a volume of poems and a play. 
Mr. Alfred Williams, another minor poet who may 
some day (who knows ?) develop into a major poet, 
works at his forge in Swindon by day and turns the 
graceful rhyme at night. Mr. William Dowsing is an 
artificer in gutta-percha as well as in verse ; indeed, 
he works in a factory, an ordnance factory. On 
friendly terms with the muse are also " A Railway 
Lad " of Belfast, a Derby laborer who writes verses 
over the signature of " Gurnet," and the " Galloway 
Poetess " who is a mill girl. The well-known aialect 
poet, Mr. Jonathan Denwood, is a draper in his 
uninspired hours. Is it that the eye of poetic imagi- 
nation, like the eye of physical sense, catches glimpses 
of certain things only by not being too directly fo- 
cussed on them? 

"Big brass generals" as heroes of boys' 
books have demonstrated their inability, despite all 
their brave trappings and splendid courage, to com- 
pete with the humbler and hence more easily con- 
ceivable " ragged Dicks " and " tattered Toms " of 
Horatio Alger's creation. Mr. E. T. Tomlinson, 
in his "World's Work" article on "The Perpetual 
Best Sellers," calls attention to the decline of Henty's 
popularity and the continued vogue of Alger. One 
can well understand why it is that a Clive in India 
or a Wolfe in Canada seem to a boy reader far less 
real, less imitable in daily life, than a Ragged Dick 
in the streets of New York. Yet theoretically, and on 
high artistic and moral grounds, Henty's bespangled 
heroes ought to do the young and ambitious reader 
far more good than Alger's street gamins. But if 
the boys cry for Alger and Oliver Optic, and weary 
of sailing under Drake's flag with Henty, it may 
be that for the promotion of honest American citizen- 
ship, rather than for the creation of British generals 
and admirals, whereof we are in no pressing need 
at present, the humbler and homelier tale will be of 



more service. Even impatient childhood ought not 
wholly to neglect Tranio's counsel in "The Taming 
of the Shrew," — to " study what you most affect." 



COMM UNICA TION. 



A STRIKING CASE OF LITERARY FORESIGHT. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Students of French Romanticism will be interested 
in Mr. Francis Gribble's article on " Alfred de Musset 
after George Sand," in the April number of " The Fort- 
nightly Review." It is an absorbing bit of literary 
gossip, this story of Musset's later love affairs, and 
perhaps some of the readers of The Dial may care to 
know the French version of the subject. Mr. Gribble, 
alas ! neglects to mention it, although he does give us 
his sources for some minor anecdotes (pp. 731, 732) in 
his story. So I have amused myself by noting the 
incidents related in the " Fortnightly " article, as they 
occur in M. Le"on Se'chd's scholarly volumes on Alfred 
de Musset (Paris, 1907).

that M. Se'che' can be witty too. And what clairvoyant 
critical insight is his! A literary tact delicate enough 
to divine, over three years ago, just what particular 
passages the English writer would choose for quotation 
from the original letters, is indeed little short of wonder- 
ful. But the great French critics are constantly giving

Mill Revealed in his Letters.* 

" To me it appears a very weighty matter to 
write a letter ; there is scarcely anything that 
we do which requires a more complete possession 
of our faculties." These words from an early 
epistle from John Stuart Mill to Carlyle prepare 
us to learn that Mill composed his letters with 
the same conscientious care which he gave to 
his books. He wrote out a fair copy for the mail 
and preserved the rough original, corrected and 
interlined, for eventual publication. The bulk 
of the letters now for the first time published 
are taken from these first drafts. The Mill 
whom they present to us is essentially the Mill 
of the Autobiography. They give the history 
of a mind, and only indirectly the revelation of 
a personality. There were probably no new 
disclosures to be made. But if there were any, 
they have been withheld. There are no letters 
to the lady whom Carlyle styled " Mrs. Platonica 
Taylor," and none to the members of Mill's 
family. 

Mr. Elliot's Introduction is the sketchiest of 
biographies and characterizations. The " Note 
on Mill's private life " by Mary Taylor is a 
sincere but timid apology for Mill's relations 
with Mrs. Taylor. The question detains us at 
the start only because the general nobility of 
Mill's character and the unswerving rectitude of 
his conduct in all other relations of life make 
us reluctant to acknowledge any defects. The 
obvious external aspect of the matter was, as his 
father bluntly put it, "that John was in love 
with another man's wife." But Mrs. Taylor had 
been forced into a loveless marriage as a girl, 
Mr. Taylor acquiesced in the friendship with 
Mill, and Mill tells us that although he and 
Mrs. Taylor "did not consider the ordinances of 
society binding in so purely personal a matter" 
their relation was conventionally correct. Mill's 
friends were rather amused at the infatuation 
of his judgment than shocked by any sense of 
impropriety in his conduct. Only John Mill's 
reputation, they said, could stand the testimonials 
that he gave to his Egeria in prefaces and dedica- 
tions. " She is a fine woman," said his brother, 
" but nothing like what John thinks." All the 
pent-up emotionality dammed by his unnatural 
education, and held in chec k through years of a

purely intellectual existence, found vent in this 
passionate devotion. We can hardly blame 
him. More serious is the fault, first clearly 
revealed to the public in Mary Taylor's apology, 
that he was permanently estranged from his 
mother because of her neglect to call upon Mrs. 
Taylor the day after he had announced his 
intended marriage with her. " Mill's letters to 
his own family," says Mary Taylor, "are too 
many of them painful . . . reading. He cannot 
. . . shake their faith in him as a ' great and 
good man.' He seems to endeavor to do this but 
fails. ... It is wonderful to see a whole family 
thus loving and enduring. Not one bitter word 
is flung back to him." It is a pity. Mill seemed 
so nearly perfect — the saint of positivism — 
that we are saddened to find this flaw. But in 
default of fuller knowledge of all the conditions, 
we cannot judge him. It is more profitable to 
turn at once to the letters which are given to 
the public and which deepen our admiration for 
the Mill that we know. 

The letters fall into two unequal groups : the 
more intimate letters written between the ages 
of twenty-two and thirty-eight mainly to Stirling 
and Carlyle, and the vast almost impersonal 
correspondence of the recognized leader of lib- 
eral thought between the years 1847 and 1873. 
For John Stirling, the hero of Carlyle's vivid 
biography, Mill seems to have felt more warmth 
of affection than for any other man. He tells 
him, anticipating Tennyson's words of Hallam: 
M I know no person who possesses more of what 
I have not than yourself." They were much 
separated, and of course were not at one in 
regard to religion. Four years after the corre- 
spondence opens Mill writes : " I suspect that 
your mind and mine have passed that point in 
their respective orbits where they approximate 
most." But he continued to regard Stirling as 
" quite the most lovable of all men I have 
known or ever look to know." And in the 
same last letter, written in answer to one 
announcing that his friend was at the point of 
death, he tells him : " I have never so much 
wished for another life as I do for the sake of 
meeting you in it." 

The longest letter, written after a summer 
vacation at the Lakes, gives an interesting 
account of Wordsworth and Southey. What 
chiefly struck Mill in Wordsworth was "the 
extensive range of his thought and the largeness 
and expansiveness of his feelings." Evidently 
Peter Bell had more sides than he showed to 
Shelley and Hazlitt. "Another acquaintance 
which I have recently made," writes Mill, " is

that of Mr. Carlyle. I have long had a very 
keen relish for his articles in the Edinburgh and 
Foreign Reviews, which I formerly thought to 
be such consummate nonsense." About eight 
months later, we have the first letter to Carlyle. 
Mill was at this time, as he tells Carlyle two 
years afterward, in "a state of reaction from 
logical utilitarian narrowness of the very nar- 
rowest kind, out of which after much unhappi- 
ness and inward struggling I had emerged and 
taken temporary refuge in its extreme opposite." 
This naturally brought the two men into a sem- 
blance of agreement that was not permanently 
possible for their temperaments. Mill's scrupu- 
lous conscience is troubled by his suppression of. 
points of difference, and finally he makes full 
confession, adding : " I have not till lately, and 
very gradually, found out that this is not 
honest." Carlyle of course reassures him that 
many divergencies of opinion will not alter his 
regard. The real difference, however, went 
deeper than abstract theology, of which at 
bottom Carlyle had as little as Mill. It was a 
difference of rhetoric, that is of psychology and 
temperament. Apropos of Teufelsdrockh, Mill 
ventures to ask " whether this mode of writing 
between sarcasm or irony and earnest be really 
deserving of so much honor as you give to it by 
making use of it so frequently." Mill at this 
period of reaction from extreme Benthamism to 
appreciation of Coleridge, Wordsworth, and 
Carlyle, conceived it to be his mission to mediate 
between the two schools of thought as he 
attempted to do in his essay on Coleridge. 
" If I have any vocation," he tells Carlyle, "it 
is exactly this, to translate the mysticism of 
others into argument." But Carlyle, who cul- 
tivated metaphor, antithesis, paradox, and pic- 
turesque exaggeration, as assiduously as Mill 
suppressed them, could have no wish to see how 
his thoughts would look stripped of their gor- 
geous investiture and exposed in the uncom- 
promising garb of a style designed to reveal the 
precise truth and proportion of things. Mill 
could and always did humbly acknowledge the 
superiority of Carlyle's genius. " I certainly 
could not now write," he says, " and perhaps 
never shall be able to write, anything from 
which any person can derive so much edification 
as I, and several others, have derived in par- 
ticular from your paper on Johnson." Mill 
could understand and do justice to Carlyle. It 
was impossible for Carlyle to perceive that in 
range of knowledge and power of reasoning he 
was a child compared to Mill. 



The correspondence with Carlyle dies out 
after 1835. The intensity of feeling on both 
sides in the Eyre controversy (1866), and with 
regard to the war in America, must have em- 
phasized the incompatibility. Carlyle said 
petulant things of Mill, as he did of every- 
body. Mill's later estimate of Carlyle appears 
in a letter to Thornton (by Helen Taylor) in 
1869 : " It is only at a particular stage in one's 
mental development that one benefits much 
by him . . . but one continues to read his best 
things with little, if any, diminution of pleas- 
ure after one has ceased to learn anything from 
him." 

The multifarious correspondence from the 
year 1847, aet. 40, to 1872 shows us Mill the 
authority whose opinions are sought on taxation, 
on the education of women, on flogging in the 
schools, on predestination, on profit-sharing, on 
the freedom of the will, on divorce for incom- 
patibility, on miracles, and on the value of a 
pretty face in a suffragette orator, as a means 
of influencing not men but women ; Mill the 
thinker exchanging views with Grote, Bain, 
Ward, and Taine, on the foundations of logio 
and psychology, the idea of cause, inconceiv- 
ability as a test of truth, and the systems of 
Comte, Spencer, and Hamilton ; Mill the pub- 
licist and member of parliament consulting or 
consulted by the liberal leaders of England, 
France, Germany, Italy, and America. We 
can only hint at the wealth of thought contained 
in these letters, or rather these finished little 
essays. A closely argued letter to Gladstone, on 
the Alabama Case, stands in immediate juxta- 
position with a searching criticism of Spencer's 
philosophy addressed to Bain. A theory of the 
origin of the moral sentiments which evolution 
has not bettered is followed by a letter to Villari 
on the situation of Italy in 1849. The twentieth 
century can exhibit examples of like versatility 
of interests but none of equal competence. For 
Mill illumines, if he does not adorn, every topic 
on which he touches. 

Many of the letters are in defense or explana- 
tion of misunderstood passages in the "Political 
Economy," the "Logic," or the "Utilitarian- 
ism." The abuse by Americans and New Zea- 
landers of Mill's concession that protection of 
infant industries may sometimes be economically 
justifiable, led him to withdraw it altogether. 
To those who herald his "Political Economy" 
as a " refutation of Socialism," he repeatedly 
explains that he is rather in sympathy with the 
ideals of socialism, though he thinks that it will 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

be long before the world is ripe for them. The 
considerable correspondence with Dr. W. G. 
Ward displays Mill's readiness to discuss phil- 
osophic problems with representatives of the 
opposite school, and his fairness and courtesy 
in weighing objections. 

To only a few does Mill write often or as a 
personal friend. Chief of them is the historian 
Grote, of whose death, shortly before his own, 
he says to Villari : " He was the oldest and by 
far the most valued of my surviving old friends." 
Next, perhaps, is Alexander Bain, who survived 
him and wrote his life, who supplied many of 
the scientific illustrations for the Logic, and with 
whom the subtlest problems of philosophy are 
frequently discussed. A large number of cordial 
letters, written mostly in French, are addressed 
to the Italian Pasquale Villari, author of the 
standard work on Machiavelli. Many letters 
are acknowledgements of presentation copies or 
replies to such acknowledgments from those to 
whom he had sent his own books. In such cases 
Mill rarely confines himself to meaningless com- 
monplaces. He criticizes and replies to criti- 
cisms always in the spirit of what he says to 
Thornton in reply to some animadversions on 
the Utilitarianism : " Were you to attack my 
book or my arguments with any amount of 
severity, I should only see in the attack, coming 
from one of whose friendship I am so certain, 
an additional proof of friendship." Perhaps 
the only failure of the judicial temper in these 
volumes is the remark in a letter to Bain : " I 
have found by actual experience of Hegel that 
conversancy with him tends to deprave one's 
intellect." 

Mill always took intense interest in American 
affairs. To his old philosophic adversary, 
Whewell, he writes : " I have felt drawn to you 
by what I have heard of your sentiments respect- 
ing the American struggle. . . . No question of 
our time has been such a touchstone of men." 
How splendidly Mill himself stood the test is 
known to all readers of the magnificent paper 
on " The Conflict in America," published in 
1862. His American correspondents include 
Motley, Parke Godwin, Godkin, E. L. Youmans, 
Mr. Horace White, Charles Eliot Norton, and 
others. He is not blinded by his enthusiasm 
for American liberalism. To a South Carolina 
Library Committee, in 1854, he expresses the 
tempered hope that " the United States may 
lead the way to mental and moral as they have 
already done to much political freedom." He 
tells Motlev that the war which has called forth 



so much heroism and constancy has also exhib- 
ited "the incompetency and mismanagement 
arising from the fatal belief of your people that 
anybody is fit for anything." And writing to 
Mr. Brace, of New York, in 1871, he fears that 
the ultimate result of the " organized system of 
plunder of the many by the few which is called 
protection " will be to place " all Americans in 
a circle, each with his hand in the pocket of his 
right-hand neighbor" — therein anticipating, 
if we mistake not, a recent cartoon. 

This review must close, although nothing has 
been said of " votes for women," the cause of 
high prices, taxation of the unearned incre- 
ment, spiritualism ; estimates of Tennyson, 
Darwin, and Spencer ; and countless other top- 
ics as interesting and as timely as any touched 
upon in this rapid survey. Mill on principle 
avoided rather than sought sententiousness and 
epigram. But he comes perilously near them 
in the observation : " Reformers should assert 
principles and only accept [not propose] com- 
promises ;" or in the remark addressed to a 
Sabbatarian : " Any place unfit to be open on 
Sunday is unfit to be open at all." 

Many of the later letters are here said to 
have been composed in whole or part by his 
secretary, Helen Taylor. I cannot think that 
all of these ascriptions are correct. I should be 
loth to believe it of the sentence, " But then I 
am a man " (Vol. II., p. 100). And it is not 
probable that she wrote the characteristic 
French letter to Taine in defense of his coun- 
trywomen. In the last sentence of this letter 
(II. 248), " Dont vous ne surprenez pas encore 
l'existence," we should obviously read soup- 
connez. So in the letter to Motley (H. 264), 
the " feeling of all English liberals ... is one 
of sincere respect for the disruption which they 
think inevitable," respect is clearly a wrong 
decipherment of regret. 

This is not the place for an estimate of Mill 
as a thinker, or for extended protest against 
the fashionable assumption that he is an anti- 
quated and negligible representative of obsolete 
Victorianism. " What was there so significant 
in John Mill ? " asks our most popular psy- 
chologist. If the up-to-date student of those 
profound philosophers, Mr. H. G. Wells, Mr. 
Bernard Shaw, and Mr. G. K. Chesterton, will 
read, mark, and inwardly digest these letters, 
and then go back to the series of sane and lucid 
works to which they form so admirable an intro- 
duction, he will find out.

THE DIAI, 



[June 16, 



The Theatre of To-Day.* 



In its attitude toward the theatre, the present 
generation has been living in a transition period. 
Forty years ago, the theatre was regarded simply 
as an amusement ; actors (except a few of the 
greatest) were social outcasts ; the writing of 
plays was counted unworthy of the best pens ; 
the drama, in John Hare's happy phrase, was 
the Cinderella of the arts. We have lived to see 
the theatre regarded as one of the most power- 
ful agents for the education of the people, the 
actor the most feasted, photographed, and flat- 
tered of men during his life, and promptly made 
the subject of elaborate biography at his death ; 
the writing of plays the greatest ambition of 
every young writer ; courses in the technique 
of the drama offered at most of our great uni- 
versities; a play (" Salvation Nell ") accepted in 
place of a thesis from a candidate for Master's 
degree at Harvard ; and Cinderella the most 
pampered, caressed, and courted of the art 
sisters. 

With such and so great changes going on 
under our eyes, it is inevitable that the old 
books dealing with the theatre — even the books 
of ten years ago — should have become quite 
obsolete ; inevitable also that the new books 
dealing with dramatic art, dramatic composi- 
tion, dramatic ideals as they exist to-day, should 
be of a wholly new type. Their mission is to 
trace this new trend of the times — to help 
us to decide whether we are justified in tak- 
ing the theatre seriously, and if so, why. Thus 
artistic and literary criticism fares forth on a 
new path, to meet new situations, to cast forth, 
if may be, the lingering ghosts of Puritanism 
that have hovered about the stage so long and 
have prejudiced or terrified so many worthy 
persons. 

A delightful escort into this new region is 
Mr. Clayton Hamilton in his book on " The 
Theory of the Theatre." Although some of 
the chapters have had previous publication in 
the magazines, the treatment is not in the least 
scrappy ; he answers the questions and explains 
the problems in proper order, and in an analytic 
fashion very satisfactory to all who wish to look 
below the surface of things. It is by no means 
superfluous that the author first takes up and 
answers the apparently simple question, What 
is a Play? A play not being a composition 
intended primarily to be read, the attempt to 

* The Theory of the Theatre, and Other Principles 
of Dramatic Criticism. By Clayton Hamilton. New York : 
Henry Holt & Co. 



test it by its literary quality only, or even 
chiefly, involves an academic fallacy. The very 
plays that we now read in the closet were in- 
tended primarily to be presented on the stage. 
So immeasurably superior as a poet is Shake- 
speare to Dryden that it is difficult for the col- 
lege student to realize that, considered solely as 
a play, Shakespeare's " Antony and Cleopatra " 
is far inferior to Dry den's " All for Love, or 
The World Well Lost," dealing with the same 
characters. Shakespeare's play is merely dra- 
matized history ; Dryden's is constructed with 
a sense of economy and emphasis that makes 
it historical drama. The beautiful and poetic 
passages in all of Shakespeare's plays make 
it hard to realize that some of them — like 
" Cymbeline" — are really very bad as plays. 

From the standpoint of the theatre, therefore, 
literature is only one of a multitude of means 
which the dramatist must employ to convey his 
story effectively to his audience. To be remem- 
bered by posterity he must cultivate literary 
excellence, but he need not write greatly to 
secure the plaudits of his own generation. As 
a matter of fact, an audience is not capable of 
hearing whether the dialogue of a play is well or 
badly written. What really moves it at Hamlet's 
line, " Absent thee from felicity awhile," is not 
the perfectness of the phrase but the pathos of 
Hamlet's plea for his best friend to outlive him 
in order to explain his motives to a world grown 
harsh. 

The problem of the dramatist is less a task 
of writing than a task of constructing. His 
primary concern is so to build a story that it 
will tell itself to the eye of the audience in a 
series of shifting pictures. Any really good 
play can be appreciated, to a great extent, even 
though acted in a foreign tongue. " Hamlet," 
being a great masterpiece of meditative poetry, 
would of course lose much if deprived of its lit- 
erary quality ; but it is, besides, so great as a 
play that its essential interest would remain if 
it were shown in moving pictures. Every play- 
wright understands that the scenario is more 
important than the dialogue ; before a line of 
the dialogue is written, it is possible in most 
cases to determine, from a full scenario, whether 
a prospective play is good or bad. 

An important difference between drama and 
most of the other arts is that it is designed to 
appeal to a crowd instead of to an individual. 
As Mr. Hamilton, the author of the work be- 
fore us, says: 

" We have to be alone in order to appreciate the 
'Venus of Milo,' or the ' Sistine Madonna,' or the 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



421 



' Ode to a Nightingale,' or ' The Egoist,' or the ' Religio 
Medici,' but who could sit alone in a wide theatre and 
see ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' performed ? The sympa- 
thetic presence of a multitude of people would be as 
necessary to our appreciation of the play as solitude in 
all the other cases." 

Hence the playwright must take into account 
the psychology of a crowd. A crowd is less 
intellectual and more emotional than the indi- 
viduals that compose it. The dramatist, there- 
fore, because he writes for a crowd writes for 
a comparatively uncivilized and uncultivated 
mind, a mind richly human, vehement in appro- 
bation, emphatic in disapproval, easily credulous, 
eagerly enthusiastic, boyishly heroic, and some- 
what carelessly unthinking. A theatre audience 
is composed of all sorts and conditions of men, — 
the rich and the poor, the literate and the illit- 
erate, the old and the young, the native and the 
naturalized. It follows that the dramatist in 
the same single work of art must incorporate 
elements that will interest them all. A theatre 
audience wants to have its emotions played upon ; 
it seeks amusement — in the widest sense of the 
word — amusement through laughter, sympathy, 
terror, tears. And it is amusement of this sort 
that the great dramatists have ever given it. 
Yet once they have fulfilled this prime necessity, 
they may also write (and the greatest always 
do write) secondarily for the few. So full of 
human interest is " Othello," so great is its 
constructive skill, that it appeals to the rab- 
ble in a thirty-cent show ; but Shakespeare, 
being a great poet as well as a great play- 
wright, employed a verse that, though lost 
upon the throng, lingers forever in the ears of 
the few. 

"Not poppy, nor mandr agora, 
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, 
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep 
Which thou own'st yesterday." 

The greatest dramatist of all, in writing for the 
crowd, did not forget the individual. 

In discussing the evolution of the drama, the 
drama of to-day is called the Drama of Illu- 
sion, to distinguish it from its predecessors, the 
Drama of Rhetoric and the Drama of Conver- 
sation. Ask the average theatre-goer about the 
merits of a play, he will praise it not for its 
stately speeches (as Sir Philip Sidney praised 
u Gorboduc "), not for its clever repartee (as 
Dryden praised the Restoration drama), but 
because it was " so natural." Sunsets and 
starlit skies, moonlight rippling over moving 
waves, fires that really burn, windows of actual 
glass, fountains plashing with real water, 
all of the naturalistic devices of our Drama 



of Illusion, have been developed in the last few 
decades — largely due to the possibilities of elec- 
tric lighting. 

Moreover, besides a whole new set of stage 
conventions we have a wholly new type of 
drama — the modern social drama, popularly 
known as the problem-play. It came into exist- 
ence about the fourth decade of the nineteenth 
century ; but in less than eighty years it has 
shown itself to be the fittest expression in 
dramaturgic terms of the spirit of the present 
age, and it is now adopted to the exclusion of 
almost every other type. It is continually 
assailed by a certain set of critics, and by 
another set continually defended. Especially 
has its morality been a theme of bitter conflict. 
Critics have been so busy calling Ibsen and his 
followers either corrupters of the mind or great 
ethical teachers, that they have not found leisure 
to consider the more general and less conten- 
tious questions of what the modern social drama 
really is and on what ground its morality should 
be determined. 

The distinguishing character of this new 
type — our modern social drama — is that the 
individual is displayed in conflict with his 
environment. A mighty war is waging between 
personal character and social conditions. The 
Greek hero struggled with the superhuman; 
the Elizabethan hero struggled with himself ; 
the modern hero struggles with the world. On 
the one side are the legions of society ; on the 
other side, a man. They who belittle the im- 
portance of the modern social drama and regard 
it as an arbitrary phase of art devised for busi- 
ness reasons merely, by a handful of clever play- 
wrights, have read but ill the signs of the times. 
For the most important topic of our day is pre- 
cisely this : the relation between the one and 
the many, in politics, in business, in religion, in 
the every-day dealings of men and women with 
each other. The theatre does not and ought 
not to shirk these problems. 

The morality or immorality of certain plays 
is not a question of subject-matter. There is 
no such thing per se as an immoral subject for 
a play ; in the treatment of the subject, and 
only in the treatment, lies the basis for ethical 
judgment of the piece. Critics who condemn 
" Ghosts " because of its subject-matter might 
as well condemn M Othello " because of its 
subject-matter — might as well condemn it be- 
cause the hero kills his wife : what a suggestion, 
look you, to carry into our homes! "Macbeth" 
is not immoral, though the play makes night 
hideous with murders. A dramatist is immoral

only when he is untrue. To make us pity his 
characters when they are vile or love them when 
they are noxious, to invent excuses for them in 
situations when they cannot be excused, — in 
a word, to lie about his characters, — this is for 
the dramatist the one unpardonable sin. To it 
must be added a second, almost equally great — 
to allure the audience to generalize falsely in 
regard to life at large, from the specific cir- 
cumstances of his play. Because plays are so 
rarely printed now-a-days, it is chiefly through 
attending plays, and studying what lies beneath 
the acting and behind the presentation, that 
even the most well-intentioned critic of contem- 
porary drama can discover what our dramatists 
are driving at. 

But the theatre is a business as well as an 
art. Therefore the critic who considers the 
drama of to-day must often turn from problems 
of art to problems of economics. He must seek 
for the root of certain evils, not in the technical 
methods of the dramatists, but in the business 
methods of the managers. At present, there 
are too many theatres ; there is an over- 
production which is unsound not only from the 
business standpoint, but in the long run it is 
likely to alienate the more thoughtful class of 
theatre-goers. 

In a fine chapter on " The Function of the 
Imagination," our author concludes his book by 
defining the proper function of the dramatist. 

" To imagine some aspect of the perennial struggle 
between human wills so forcibly as to make us realize it 
in the full sense of the word, — realize it as we daily 
fail to realize the countless struggles we ourselves 
engage in, the Theatre, rightly considered, is not a 
place in which to escape from the realities of life, but a 
place in which to seek refuge from the unrealities of 
actual living in the contemplation of life realized, — 
life made real by imagination." 

Mr. Hamilton's book is dedicated " To 
Brander Matthews, Mentor and Friend "; and 
it does indeed show traces throughout of the 
older man's influence. Nevertheless, it occupies 
a place distinctly its own, and bears well a com- 
parison with Mr. Matthews's almost simulta- 
neous " Study of the Drama." In a general way 
Mr. Matthews is more academic, Mr. Hamilton 
more popular without being less critical or 
scholarly. Like Macaulay in his reviews, he 
brings his subject " down to last Saturday 
night," and hence his book will be of great help 
to readers and playgoers who are not quite clear 
why the theatre of to-day is something to be 
reckoned with in all sincerity and seriousness.

Is Pragmatism Pragmatic;?* 



" Pragmatism asks its usual question Grant an idea 
or belief to be true, it says, what concrete difference will 
its being true make in any one's actual life? What 
experiences may be different from those which would 
obtain if the belief were false? How will the truth be 
realized? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in 
experiental terms? The moment pragmatism asks this 
question, it sees the answer: True ideas are those that 
we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. 
False ideas are those that we cannot." — William James. 

" There is no difference that does not make a differ- 
ence. The best of theories must be found in practice. 
The pragmatic philosophy is a renewed emphasis of this 
truth. It is a philosophy of doing, and of knowing only 
in relation to doing. It is a philosophy of work, of 
activity, of enterprise, of achievement. And for this 
reason it has taken up arms against all forms of dogma- 
tism and apriorism, in so far as these stand for intel- 
lectual interests which do not grow out of, nor minister 
to, the needs of life." — H. H. Bawden. 

" Note that I have no reproach to urge against 
society for being pragmatic, that is to say, for watching 
over its own interests. On the contrary, I think it is 
perfectly legitimate that it should do so. And, besides, 
the word ' interests ' may be taken in the widest, or, if 
you please, most elevated sense. But I do reproach a 
school of modern philosophers for wishing to force 
impersonal philosophy, a moral science, indifferent 
nature, to speak the same language as our aspirations 
and our passions, and even, I grant, our generous 
aspirations, our noble passions. Our innate and psychic 
tendencies (in the moral, social, and religious realms) 
are phenomena for science to record and authenticate, 
not to justify or legitimize." — A Ibert Schinz. 

Pragmatism is not a new philosophy ; it is 
the name of a movement seeking to alter the 
trend of philosophic thought so as to lay emphasis 
on practical values. Philosophy, if hitherto a 
wild thing of the woods, is now to be harnessed 
to the cart of our needs, and with a little train- 
ing may prove a serviceable and docile beast. 
It is feared by some, however, that when this 
happens philosophy will no longer lead us any- 
where, but will have to be driven. The nag 
may be easier to hitch and better to go than 
the star, but will it have as constant a sense of 
direction ? 

It is curious that this controversy should ever 
have arisen. With the partial exception of man, 
all living nature is frankly pragmatic. It is an 
axiom of the biologist that every creature lives 
for itself, and no case is known in which one 
species possesses any activity solely for the good 
of another, much less for no good at all. A

few supposed cases of this sort, such as that of 
the plant in forming a gall for the gall-fly, break 
down on examination. It is not rarely true 
that the individual is sacrificed for the species, 
but each species has no other object than its own 
preservation. This being the case, pragmatism 
(" opportunism in philosophy " Mr. Schinz calls 
it) seems natural and inevitable, and any de- 
parture from it suicidal in the long run. Shall 
there be a science or a philosophy which deals 
with things that are absolutely of no consequence 
to human life ? Put in this way, the question 
is absurd. Professor Schinz has no such idea ; 
the quarrel really is on the question " What is 
worth while?" Professor James says — and all 
other pragmatists repeat — that, for us, things 
are not different if they make no differences. 
This again is in some sort an absurdity ; for we 
could not conceive them to be different if they 
really were psychological equivalents, while if 
they were metaphysical we could not conceive 
of them at all. The real crux of the debate can 
be represented by the query, Is pragmatism 
pragmatic ? Does the particular kind of philo- 
sophic emphasis represented by the pragmatic 
school, in the largest sense and in the longest 
run, really serve the best needs of mankind ? 

For our guidance, we may take note of the 
history of science. For long ages science pro- 
gressed hardly at a snail's pace ; in the last two 
hundred years it has passed through a trot to 
a gallop, and, so far as we can see, will shortly 
take to an aeroplane. This tremendous accel- 
eration may be partly explained in the sense of 
maturity following a long period of youth, but 
it must be mainly due to a difference in method. 
The science of the middle ages mostly revolved 
in circles or followed blind alleys. With some 
brilliant exceptions, it was academic in the sense 
of being apart from life. It was contemplative 
rather than progressive, static rather than dy- 
namic. It is not true to-day that it made no 
difference, even in its least valuable forms ; but 
as compared with its modern representative, it 
made very little. The study of a grasshopper's 
hind leg, as carried on to-day, is more worth 
while, intellectually and practically, than was 
the study of the universe at a time when the 
student asked no question but " What do the 
ancient classics say?" 

Pragmatism, then, if we may venture to 
interpret it briefly, accuses philosophy (and 
ultimately some other things !) of being in large 
part where science was several hundred years 
ago. If it tries to prove that these things have 
no purpose and no meaning — even the poorest 



of them — it will fail ; but taking the stand that 
we must get the greatest amount of good out of 
life, and that our philosophy must be a going 
concern, it appears to be abundantly justified. 
There is, indeed, a danger on the other side. 
There are many signs that science in these days 
tends to become so opportunistic that it denies 
itself the larger outlook, and eventually defeats 
its own ends. The advice to seek first the 
kingdom of heaven is as sound as it ever was ; 
and there can be no doubt that the adoption of 
pragmatic ideals would in crasser minds lend 
justification to conduct which, from the stand- 
point of the race, would be highly injurious. 
Perhaps we may put the thing in this form : 
Science progresses in proportion to its work- 
ableness and unity. Philosophy might do the 
same, but the ordinary individual is something 
like a planet kept in its course by the interaction 
of two (or more) opposing forces. To him, a 
single consistent working philosophy would per- 
haps be destructive, just as though one of the 
factors in a balance had been removed. It 
would necessarily accumulate around the larger 
influences in his life, and if these were good, 
well enough ; but if they were inferior, what 
then ? This, I think, is the real essence of the 
anti-pragmatist position ; and it cannot be 
lightly disposed of. 

To those who are conservative by training 
and disposition, the ancient cobwebs in the 
halls of learning seem beautiful and precious ; 
to others (including the writer) it seems that 
they should be removed, for we have better 
things to put in their places. We desire for 
Professor James the longest broom and strong- 
est arm ; but we are not sure that we wish 
the whole household to go spider-hunting. 
We suspect, in fact, that some are not expert 
arachnologists. 

After all this, we have not described the con- 
tents of the books that have formed the text of 
our discourse, but have merely tried to indicate 
in some manner the nature of their subject. It 
should be said about Professor Schinz, that he 
really represents what from our standpoint is a 
reactionary social policy. We do not agree 
with his opinions on things in general, and do 
regard him as a defender of cobwebs ; but that 
does not prevent the recognition of the valid 
part of his argument. 

Professor Bawden's book is really a general 
treatise on philosophy and psychology, and it 
does not seem to us that the title accurately 
describes the contents.

Sheridan and his Contemporaries. 



It is doubtful if there is in the whole range of 
the eighteenth century a man more fascinating to 
the biographer than Richard Brinsley Sheridan, 
and that too in a century crowded with remark- 
able and picturesque men ; yet it is not till now, 
nearly a hundred years after his death, that we 
have a just and adequate biography of him. 
Mr. Sichel's work gives us the real Sheridan in 
his proper environment ; it presents him in all 
the pomp and circumstance of his age. Equally 
brilliant, as Lord Holland said, " in the closet, 
the theatre, and the senate," Sheridan had a 
personality as varied as it was attractive, as 
contradictory as it was persuasive. He was in 
some respects a genuine child of the century. 
He had all the sentimentalism and melancholy 
of the time. He was in sympathetic touch with 
the new romanticism, as is shown by an Ossianic 
fragment quite in the fashion of the romantic 
Macpherson, which Mr. Sichel gives us. And 
yet again he was no mere child of the period. 
He was a democrat at a time when the haughty 
Duchess of Buckingham could say of the Meth- 
odists, "It is monstrous to be told that you have 
a heart as sinful as the common wretches that 
crawl on the earth. This is highly offensive and 
revolting." In an age when political purity was 
a largely negligible quantity, he was above a 
bribe and he could therefore the more effectively 
prosecute Warren Hastings. But he was most 
of all a Sheridan, the grandson of the erratic and 
guileless Dr. Thomas Sheridan, Swift's friend, 
who on the anniversary of the accession of the 
Hanoverians innocently preached on the text, 
" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." 
His procrastination was as notorious as his care- 
lessness. His wife speaks of " the bottomless 
pit of his pocket," and records that " anything 
in his hands is irrecoverable." He would dis- 
charge large sums that were not even claims, and 
yet leave his old servants, Martha and Sarah, 
coalless and without their wages. He was " god- 
like in giving but the devil to pay." When 
his purse was full, he would empty it for chil- 
dren and servants ; and he would push over 
an "10 U" with the exclamation, anticipating 
Micawber, " Thank God, that 's settled." His wit 
was unfailing ; even when he lay dying besieged 
by bailiffs, he ordered a placard to be placed 
with this inscription : " I know your necessities 
before you ask them and your ignorance in ask- 
ing." On the other hand, we have his keen

sensitiveness to suffering, as shown, for instance, 
when his first wife died, his beautiful and accom- 
plished St. Cecilia. 

Sheridan's Irish origin helps in part to ex- 
plain the man ; but, as Mr. Sichel says : 

" This is not all. He was no ordinary Irishman, nor, 
indeed, an ordinary being. Take his career. His prog- 
ress seemed slow, but his successes were sudden. He 
became great, as it were, by stealth. He sauntered 
into notice and glided into fame. He stole into the wills 
and affections of men and women by a wizardry of his 
own. Yet out of many incongruous colours, which at 
first sight might seem to baffle portraiture, a distinct 
picture emerges. . . . The knight of the free lance 
enters the lists, tilts at bewitched quintains, and in 
every tournament carries away the prize. . . . He owns 
the talisman of personal magnetism, and often as the 
courtiers turn on their heel — their wont when genius 
blocks the way — he calmly pursues the zigzag of his 
course with an inscrutable smile that wins them back 
again. But the plaudits die away. Without an audience 
he broods and dies. He waits, drowning reflection, and 
draining bumper on bumper to the past which he vows 
to retrieve. A fresh bugle-call dispels his apathy. He 
starts eager from his cups, charges new enemies, and 
gathers fresh laurels. Once more he feels invincible, 
till, too often the world's dupe and his own, disillusion- 
ized, though never soured, battered by disease, intemper- 
ance, and distresses, he sinks at length into a neglected 
death-bed but an honoured grave." 

Such is the man that Mr. Sichel admirably 
portrays in two large volumes of over a thou- 
sand pages. But he does more. He outlines 
the century as the fitting background for the pic- 
ture, and shows Sheridan's relations to the mul- 
tifarious activities of the age. It was the time 
of Rousseau and Sterne, of the American and 
the French Revolutions ; it was a carnival of 
drinking and gambling, and of " bare, bald cor- 
ruption " in politics ; it was an age of scandal, 
immortalized in Sheridan's comedy, of extortion, 
of preciosity and brutality, of taste and turbu- 
lence, of color and costume, of gallantry and 
gaiety. And all this Mr. Sichel illustrates from 
the careers of Sheridan and his contemporaries. 

The course of Sheridan's life, his courtship 
and runaway marriage with the beautiful and 
talented Miss Linley, his duels with his rival, 
his remarkable success with the drama, his 
social and political rise to the very foot of the 
throne, reads like a romance, and it loses none 
of its effectiveness in this spirited narrative. 
And Mr. Sichel is scholarly and as interesting 
whether he is treating Sheridan's literary and 
dramatic work or tracing his steps to the elo- 
quent arraignment of Warren Hastings. His 
discussion of " The Rivals " and " The School 
for Scandal " is a sound piece of literary criti- 
cism. He traces the evolution of " The School " 
from the sheet of dialogue for " The Slander-

ers — A Pump-Room Scene," through two short 
scenes, one satirizing an ill-assorted match (the 
Teazle story), the other a melodramatic comedy 
of jealousy and intrigue, which is the real nu- 
cleus of the plot, to the perfect comedy. The 
charge of plagiarism is disposed of, and the 
relation to Sheridan's predecessors in comedy 
is dealt with at some length. An interesting 
sketch is given of contemporary and subsequent 
performances of "The School for Scandal" 
down to the masterly revival by Mr. Beerbohm 
Tree last summer in London. 

A considerable amount of new material has 
enabled Mr. Sichel to reveal the Sheridan of 
politics and society as he has not been hitherto 
known. The Diary of Georgiana, Duchess of 
Devonshire, from November 20, 1788, to Jan- 
uary 12, 1789, gives interesting glimpses of 
him, and is especially entertaining in its account 
of the insanity of George III., for she tells a 
goodly number of the things he did when really 
crazy. Mr. Sichel has been able, moreover, 
to recover parts of Sheridan's great speeches, 
especially the Begum speech preliminary to the 
trial of Warren Hastings, and the still greater 
speech of the trial itself — the speech that took 
four days to deliver, that was heard by all the 
social and political world, and that was the 
crowning glory of Sheridan's career. The re- 
lation of Sheridan to the French Revolution, 
his opposing Burke and defending the French, 
his condemnation of the war against France, and 
his loyal defence of England against the threat- 
enings of Napoleon, is discussed with insight 
and sympathy. The pathos of Sheridan's later 
life is brought out with all the affection of a 
lover. " Exclusion," says Mr. Sichel, " forms 
the motto of these dismal years (1809-1812): 
exclusion from the theatre, exclusion from his 
party, exclusion eventually from Carlton House, 
and exclusion from St. Stephen's." The closing 
chapter is sad indeed ; disease and poverty were 
followed by death, and then, as in keeping with 
the strange changes of fortune that marked 
his whole career, his burial was in Westminster 
Abbey with all that the nation accords those 
whom she delights to honor. 

Sheridan's life was a remarkable one, for the 
man himself was remarkable, — so much so that 
Mr. Sichel seems justified in saying that he 
remains " a sprite, hovering above the puppet- 
show of existence. He belongs not to the 
white-robed immortals who sit radiant and aloft, 
but to the elfin band who have never faded from 
our atmosphere. His province is not history 
but wonderland." James w> Tupper . ' 



Modern Landscape.* 

Nature is not the same thing as scenery, nor 
is scenery the same thing as landscape. And it 
may be that both Dr. Myra Reynolds and Mr. 
Birge Harrison will think it is confusing what 
they wish to make clear, to put together their 
two books — one on the poetic treatment of 
Nature in the eighteenth century and the 
other on landscape-painting at the present day. 
Really, however, there is a good deal of con- 
nection. Miss Reynolds, it is true, deals with 
a larger topic in a broader field. She speaks 
• of the sense of Nature in general, as exhibited 
in literature, painting, landscape-gardening, 
travel ; while Mr. Harrison writes especially of 
pictures. Still, although it is a mistake to con- 
fuse the arts, and to speak as though they were 
all much the same sort of thing — except per- 
haps in material and audience, — yet these two 
books show a difference in general culture and 
thought that is very interesting. 

Our feeling in art at the present day differs 
decidedly from that of the age of Queen Anne. 
That the classicism of Pope gave way in the 
course of a hundred years to the romanticism of 
Byron, of Shelley, and Wordsworth, is a com- 
monplace ; as also that this change of artistic 
feeling is to be observed in other forms of cul- 
ture than literature. Music and painting have 
had their classicism and their romanticism as 
well as poetry, though their times and sea- 
sons in the different nations of Europe have 
been rather different. The transitions of the 
eighteenth century are very clear, but it is not 
always clear what changes may have occurred 
since. 

Mr. Harrison, concerned with the artistic 
things of art rather than the speculative or the 
historical, makes a remark that suggests the 
result as far as landscape painting is concerned. 
Miss Reynolds has a chapter on landscape paint- 
ing in the eighteenth century, in which (besides 
collecting a splendid mass of material) she traces 
the development of a love of nature among 
English painters, and, indeed, writes : " But in 
abundance and variety of theme the English 
landscape artists have by the end of the century 
surpassed even the poetry of the period " (p. 
321). Mr. Harrison, however, writes : " Not 
until the early years of the nineteenth century, 
and then in far-away England, did the first

true school of landscape make its appearance " 
(p. 5). This does not mean that Mr. Harrison 
has never heard of Richard Wilson, is unaware 
of Gainsborough's painting every tree within 
miles of Ipswich, does not know that there was 
a painter named Girvin. It simply means that 
he holds that the movement which began with 
Crome, Borington, Cotman, Constable, in the 
first quarter of the nineteenth century, has so 
influenced modern painting that whatever went 
before is simply not worth considering. 

All this has no bearing on the historical char- 
acter of Miss Reynolds's facts and deductions ; 
but it has something to do with what we shall 
think of her book and Mr. Harrison's, and what 
we shall think of the nature and the art that 
they present. And this will be the case even 
more here in America than elsewhere, because 
in America the influences traced by Miss Rey- 
nolds had more free play than in Europe, where 
they almost at once were confused with other 
powerful forces, and also because the influences 
of which Mr. Harrison writes have hardly been 
of importance for more than thirty or forty 
years. For we shall want to read the books of 
those two authors, I take it, not merely as his- 
toric or artistic treatises, but because we may 
find in them guidance, stimulus, suggestion, or 
what not, for our own thinking and feeling and 
enjoyment of nature, whether in the garden or 
in the woods, and in art whether in picture or 
in poetry. We read of the rise of romanticism 
out of classicism, and are interested because we 
enjoy those things that were dear to the romantic 
soul ; or we read of the ideas and principles of 
modern schools of landscape, because it makes 
clearer to us the beauty of the last picture we 
saw, or opens to us the beauty of some new one. 
As we read and appreciate how the English poets 
came to enjoy and love the mountains and the 
lakes, we feel that we understand all that ; as 
we read of the change from the trim and clipped 
conventionality of the formal garden to the open 
and free English parks we enjoy that too ; as we 
look at the difference between the early classic 
landscapes of Wilson and his later more romantic 
scenes, or as we look at Gainsborough and think 
of Claude, we feel that we understand the 
change, even that it is a part of us. Somewhat 
disconcerting, then, is the idea that that view of 
landscape (at least) is non-existent to-day ; that 
in all that reading we were merely interesting 
ourselves in archaeology ; that if we wish to be 
modern we must become acquainted with other 
feelings, other emotions, other ideals; that 
Gainsborough, Wordsworth, Repton are now 



historical, and that art to-day has masters of 
very different kind. 

In America, as has been said, this feeling 
will be stronger than elsewhere, for in America 
our traditional ideas of beauty in landscape and 
in poetry and in landscape-painting developed 
directly, and without much external influence, 
from the ideas of England in the eighteenth 
century. When Constable and Borington were 
impressing the simple quiet claim of domestic 
scenery, as well as their very striking mode of 
rendering it, upon Rousseau and Millet, Thomas 
Cole and Asher Durand were carrying out the 
romantic ideals of Wilson and Gainsborough, 
just as Cooper and Irving were carrying out the 
romantic conceptions of scenery that we love in 
Sir Walter Scott. The result was aided by the 
fact that America had much of the wild and 
romantic in her scenery. Our mountains and 
our rivers, with their gorges and waterfalls, 
aroused and stimulated a pleasure in the free 
and grandiose forms of nature that has by no 
means died out. In the eighteenth century 
Europe learned the beauty of the mountain ; and, 
in America at least, the lesson has not been 
forgotten. It is probable that more visitors 
to the Metropolitan Museum admire the great 
picture of the Rocky Mountains by Bierstadt 
than pause before all the pictures by George 
Innes put together. This does not show that it 
is better for one to do so, but simply that such 
is the widely-prevailing popular feeling for land- 
scape in America. 

Miss Reynolds's book treats admirably the 
growth of this sentiment in England in the 
eighteenth century. Originally a study only 
of poetry, it has been extended to cover the 
other fields of art and culture, and now gives 
an immensely interesting study of the growth 
of the romantic love of nature. Her reading 
is very wide and her treatment includes much, 
indeed almost everything that one can think 
of. For myself, I must confess that she seems 
rather to lack temperament, or at least the 
power to convey temperament. Take Thomson, 
for instance. We learn much from her about 
Thomson, — that he was most sensitive to the 
sights and sounds of nature, that he wrote from 
a deep personal experience, that he knew the 
sterner phenomena of nature and also her less 
ordinary phases, that he loved her for her own 
sake. But with all that, I miss some apprecia- 
tion of why or how it was that Thomson thought 
that these were the great things of life, the 
things that poetry should render. In the mass 
of facts that she has gathered and so clearly

correlated, Miss Reynolds often seems at a loss 
to appreciate values. Of Wilson, for instance : 
it is delightful to find in her book some of 
Wilson's Welsh pictures which will be new to 
all but the student of his art. But what is it 
in Wilson that gives him still something of a 
hold on painter and public alike ? What is 
there, in other words, of value in this romantic 
view of nature ? At a time like ours, when that 
view is being lost in the past, when one is likely 
to be distracted by all sorts of more modern 
interests, one would gladly find some " apprecia- 
tion (as they say) of the spirit of romantic art. 

Miss Reynolds will perhaps remind us that 
her work is historic and not critical ; and cer- 
tainly in the field of the history of culture she 
has produced a book that one cannot do without. 
I know of no other place where so much of value 
in its own field is given, where the course of 
general culture of that day is so well exhibited. 
I presume there are deficiencies and errors in 
the book, but certainly not very many. If there 
be a lack, I should find it in the failure some- 
times to give adequate causes or reasons for the 
phases of feeling that she chronicles. Thus — 
just for one thing — take the love of mountain 
scenery. One may find in Miss Reynolds's pages 
the successive steps of its growth in poetry, pic- 
ture, travel. But where did the feelingr come 
from? If one is going to deal with literary 
history, this is certainly a fair question. Miss 
Reynolds — unless I have missed something — 
says nothing about it. She quotes in a footnote, 
and without comment, the commonplace that 
Rousseau opened the eyes of Europe to the 
beauty of the Alps. But that has little appli- 
cation to England : long before the " Nouvelle 
Heloise " was thought of, Horace Walpole and 
Thomas Gray had appreciated to the full the 
wonders of the Alps. They were probably 
themselves not the first ; probably there were 
always in England those who were struck by the 
wild and grand in mountain scenery. Evelyn 
in the seventeenth century is not without appre- 
ciation of mountains, nor Lady Mary Wortley 
Montagu at the beginning of the eighteenth. 
They liked other things better, doubtless, as did 
Horace Walpole ; but, like him, they felt but 
now and then the romantic wildness of mountain 
scenery. It was to them, perhaps, an escape 
from the conventional which they otherwise 
loved, an opening of a new horizon, as it has 
been to so many since their day. 

It may be the exhilaration of the discovery 
of a new world that gives character to the newer 
landscape of which Mr. Harrison writes. One 



; will find in his book few, perhaps none, of the 
motives noted by Miss Reynolds. If we may 
judge from him, it would be a matter of indiffer- 
ence to an artist whether he painted a mountain 
or a haystack in the pasture. That England, 
as also Europe and America, should have been 
aroused to the wonders of mountain and valley, 

i cataract and precipice, is a fact that one may 
neglect on turning over his pages, for he is 

I absorbed in the delight of other and newer dis- 
coveries. Light and vibration, color and value — 
these may be seen alike on mountain and hay- 
stack ; indeed, rather more conveniently on the 
latter. One can find as much pleasure in a 
common November hill-slope with its stone walls

Mabcus Whitman Once More.* 



Still another life of Marcus Whitman has 

I been published. It is the posthumous work of 

i the Reverend Myron Eells, who died in January 

of 1907. Mr. Eells was a son of the Reverend 

i Cushing Eells, an associate of Dr. Whitman in 

! the work of the Oregon missions, the author 

i of one of the early versions of the Whitman 

story, and the founder of Whitman College. 

Born in Oregon in 1843, and brought up in 

i the hotbed of Whitmanism, Mr. Eells was never 

able to see beyond it. Although much moderated 

in tone, this book still claims that Whitman 

went East in the winter of 1842-43 to " save

Oregon," and that Oregon was " saved " as the 
result of his representations in Washington and 
of the assistance that he rendered to the emigra- 
tion of 1843. What new evidence does it pre- 
sent in support of this contention? Absolutely 
none. In all essential points it is little more 
than a repetition of the pamphlet that Mr. Eells 
issued in 1883. The case still rests upon the 
pseudo-recollections of Spalding and Geiger, 
from twenty to forty years after the event, and 
upon the books of Gray and Barrows, whose 
authority has been hopelessly discredited. These 
statements are crowded with contradictions, 
impossibilities, and absurdities, which it would 
be a work of supererogation to analyze in detail, 
since they were fully covered in Professor 
Bourne's well-known essay. That Mr. Eells 
should have continued to cling to Spalding as 
an authority is passing strange, since he has 
himself shown that the Spalding version of the 
story was almost wholly erroneous, and excused 
its vagaries on the ground that Spalding was 
"unbalanced" by the hardships he suffered at 
the time of the Whitman massacre. 

That Mr. Eells had no conception of the 
nature of historical evidence, and no knowledge 
of the source material of American history, 
is clear from his arguments in this book. It 
is claimed that there would be no record of 
the negotiation of the supposed treaty for 
the surrender of Oregon, because it was not 
consummated ; that the fact that no copy of 
Whitmans supposed pamphlet in support of 
the emigration of 1843 has ever come to light 
is " no valid objection," and that the argument 
that " evidence given from memory and written 
many years after the events occurred ... is 
not good when unaccompanied by contemporary 
written documents . . . is of little weight." 
Now in this case the " evidence given from 
memory " is accompanied by an abundance of 
" contemporary written documents," all of them 
entirely consistent and flatly contradicting the 
recollections " written many years after the 
events occurred." The only parts of this evi- 
dence that the present book notices are Whit- 
man's own letters, which it endeavors to explain 
by claiming that Whitman omitted all reference 
to his larger purpose from fear of the Hudson 
Bay Company and the Mission Board. The let- 
ters, taken together with those of Mrs. Whitman, 
are too consistent to admit of any such con- 
struction, and Dr. Whitman was too honest a 
man to have been guilty of the systematic eva- 
sion that this construction assumes. That Dr. 
Whitman rendered great service to the emigra- 



tion of 1843 is unquestioned ; but the claim 
that this emigration was dear to his heart is 
absolutely disproved by the two letters that he 
wrote from Shawnee Mission. 

Much that has been written about "saving 
Oregon" has been based upon an entire mis- 
conception of the status of the Oregon question. 
Despite the party shibboleth of " Fifty-four forty, 
or fight," the United States was absolutely com- 
mitted to the line of the 49th parallel. The 
British government was similarly committed to 
the line of the Columbia river. The only part 
of Oregon that was in question was the part 
between the Columbia river and the 49th par- 
allel. Dr. Whitman understood this perfectly, 
and wrote his brother-in-law, November 5,1846, 
before he had heard that the boundary had 
been settled, and without expressing any interest 
in the matter : " North of the Columbia, you 
know, is in dispute between the British and the 
States ; you may early learn the result." This 
is the only part of Oregon that was " saved," 
and with this part Dr. Whitman never had any- 
thing whatever to do. 

The book charges the late Professor Bourne 
with inaccuracy in saying that " Greenhow's 
exhaustive history was being distributed as a 
public document " in 1843, inasmuch as Green- 
how's " History of Oregon and California " was 
not published until later. The book to which 
Professor Bourne referred was Greenhow's 
" Memoir, Historical and Political, on the North- 
West Coast of North America," which was 
published as a public document in 1840, and 
of which the Senate ordered the issue of twenty- 
five hundred copies " in addition to the usual 
number." Professor Bourne's statement in 
regard to Fremont was also absolutely correct. 
With respect to the date of Dr. White's report 
as Indian Agent, he appears to have been in 
error. This is all there is of the vaunted " mis- 
takes of Professor Bourne." 

The editors of this volume present as a front- 
ispiece a picture of the statue of Whitman on 
the Witherspoon Building in Philadelphia, a 
replica of which in staff was unveiled last year 
at the Alaska- Yukon Exposition. As there is 
no portrait of Whitman extant, this represen- 
tation of him must be largely imaginary, and 
therefore serves as an appropriate introduction 
to the pen-picture in the text. The purpose of 
the volume is indicated by the map at the end, 
illustrating the educational field of Whitman 
College. It would contribute greatly to the 
reputation of this institution if its friends would 
abandon the unfounded pretensions that have

Briefs ox New Books. 



_, . , In Professor Munsterberg's volume 

problems of appearing under the title "American 

American life. p ro blems from the Point of View of 
a Psychologist" (Moffat, Yard & Co.) we find a 
collection of the miscellanous essays contributed by 
him to various magazines, and which at the time of 
their first publication attracted unusual attention 
and aroused considerable discussion; for each one 
of them treats of an important question in an orig- 
inal and forceful way. Tbe opening paper, on 
" The Fear of Nerves," declares that we twentieth- 
century Americans are not so much victims of over- 
wrought nerves as victims to the belief that we 
ought to be or are bound to be nervously prostrated 
by the conditions of our complicated and breathless 
manner of life. The author reassuringly points out 
how much better off in all that makes for bodily 
and mental ease we are than our ancestors were. 
In " The Choice of a Vocation " and " The Market 
and Psychology " some important and little- 
recognized functions of psychologic science are dis- 
cussed. In " The Standing of Scholarship " and 
" Books and Bookstores " the viewpoint of the edu- 
cated German reveals itself. In the closing essay, 
on " The World Language," the false assumptions 
and mistaken zeal of the Simplified Spelling Board 
are incidentally held up to criticism. Especially 
significant is the German-born author's testimony 
that this language-mending — or language-marring, 
rather — will greatly increase the difficulty expe- 
rienced by foreigners in learning our tongue. Among 
other objections to the whole deplorable business, he 
says : " Even the obscuring words with a double 
meaning have been increased : mist is now mist and 
missed ; past is now past and passed ; and yet 
nowhere unity : wisht but not fisht, winkt but not 
linkt." He also effectively disposes of the conten- 
tion that it is our English spelling that keeps our 
schoolchildren one or two years behind the German 
schoolchildren. There are other polemic chapters 
in the book quite as good and almost as much 
needed as this timely protest. The volume is one 
to read with that wholeness of attention which the 
writer repeatedly warns us we are in danger of 

losing.

from Brown University, to Nora Perry, his much- 
admired and esteemed friend in Providence, are now 
edited by Miss Caroline Ticknor, under the title "A 
Poet in Exile," and published in the Riverside series 



of limited editions, by Houghton Mifflin Company 
Not only Hay's exile from cultured New England 
to the rude West of fifty years ago is indicated by 
the book's title, but also his early banishment — 
self -banishment it might be called — from the poet's 
peaceful Arcady, where his temperament and tastes 
fitted him to dwell, to the dust and turmoil of the 
world of affairs. Accompanying the letters went a 
few metrical compositions, which the maturer and 
more fastidious John Hay would doubtless have 
blushed to own, but which, in their present setting 
and with Miss Ticknor's graceful and appropriate 
words of introduction, present an interesting and 
not unworthy picture of the young writer's mental 
and emotional state in that storm-and-stress period 
when he was making the feverish attempts of ardent 
youth to find himself. Five in number, the letters 
were written at long intervals in the years 1858, 
1859, and 1860. It is Hay the possible great poet, 
the possible eloquent preacher, the possible smart 
lawyer or man of businsss, but always Hay the 
idealist and dreamer, not yet entered on the path of 
positive achievement and assured renown, that flits 
uncertainly before the vision in reading these soulful 
outpourings of his to a sympathetic and highly-gifted 
friend. They have the deep seriousness of ingenuous 
youth, and the verses they enclose treat (with the 
natural propensity of unclouded adolescence) of the 
dark things of destiny and the melancholy charms 
of death. But in aptness and fluency of expression, 
at least, they and the letters reveal powers above the 
average. There is certainly no cause for regret, 
but rather much reason to be thankful, that these 
glimpses of what may be called the ante-Lincolnian 
John Hay have been vouchsafed us. An expressive 
portrait of the young man makes a charming frontis 
piece for the beautifully printed volume.

that is at once quiet and keen, and a due sense of 
the peculiar trials and vexations of their increas- 
ingly arduous calling. Mr. Pearson's chapters, 
fourteen in number, are short and crisp, and, with 
the exception of one reprinted from " The Library 
Journal " and one read at the librarians' gathering 
at Lake Minnetonka two years ago, are from the 
upper stratum of the cream of his " Transcript " 
articles. Especially timely are two chapters con- 
taining words of eloquent defense of "Tom Sawyer" 
and " Huckleberry Finn," which " Miss Timmins " 
and certain other maiden custodians of children's 
reading-rooms are trying to suppress. The amusing 
quality of Mr. Pearson's book must not beguile the 
conscientious reviewer into overlooking certain 
small errors, which are the more noteworthy because 
of that minute and painful accuracy that character- 
izes, or is supposed to characterize, every librarian 
to the manner born. The long-suffering printer 
cannot be chargeable with all the lapses we have 
noted. Scott's fiction is spoken of as " the Waver ly 
novels." " Sanatarium " is perhaps written in an 
attempt to please two opposing factions, the " sani- 
tarium" and the " sanatorium " advocates. Page 
1467 of a certain imaginary book is described as 
" the left hand one," with no explanation of this 
unaccountable pagination. Finally, one is surprised 
that a librarian should deliberately use, in writing 
for publication, so loose English as occurs in the 
author's reference to "the saying of Dr. Johnson 
about the two kinds of knowledge — the first being 
when you know a thing itself, the second when you 
know where you can find it out." And so, with 
these not captious criticisms, we regretfully close 
" The Library and the Librarian." 

The story of f ud g e Ben B \ L™<W, the « boys' 

a struggle with judge" of national fame, has been 
evil and misrule, contributing to " Everybody's Mag- 
azine " a series of chapters describing his fight with 
" the Beast " in Denver. The Beast represents in his 
narrative all that is corrupt and greedy and brutal 
and unscrupulous in public government and in busi- 
ness corporations. The whole story is now gathered 
into a book entitled " The Beast," and published, 
with a frontispiece picture of the author and some of 
his boy friends, by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
Mr. Harvey J. O'Higgins has given efficient aid as 
editor, or amanuensis. It will be difficult for any- 
one to begin the book without going on to the end. 
Judge Lindsey is the father of the Juvenile Court 
now known to many large cities, and naturally the 
most important chapters of his relation have to do 
with his long and at last victorious fight for the rescue 
of Denver's boy and girl law-breakers from the 
revoltingly corrupt influences of the ordinary jail 
and prison. One passage, from the middle of the 
book, exposes the root of the evil in Denver's cor- 
ruption and misrule. " The rule of the plutocracy in 
Denver was the cause of three-quarters of the crime 
in Denver. The dependent and delinquent children 
who came into my court came almost wholly from 



the homes of dependent and delinquent parents who 
were made such by the hopeless economic conditions 
of their lives ; and those conditions were made hope- 
less by the remorseless tyranny of wealthy men who 
used their lawless power to enslave and brutalize 
and kill their workmen." What is most impressive 
in these leaves from a life of heroic service is the 
evident fact that the writer is not a man to be bought 
with however high a price. His moral control of 
boys, even of the hardest cases, is also something 
admirable. The book is as interesting as it is sorely 
needed in this era of plutocratic and governmental 

wrong-doing. 

a book for ^ r * Frederic Rowland Marvin's "Ex- 

book-iovers, cursions of a Book-lover " (Sherman, 

by one of them. French & Co.) contains a rich store 
of exceptionally interesting out-of-the-way book- 
lore. The author has read widely and thought 
deeply, and his varied experiences as doctor of the 
body and also of the soul (he is entitled to the use, 
which he foregoes, of both D.D. and M.D. after his 
name) give his utterances a certain impressiveness 
and his reminiscences a certain human quality that 
are beyond the reach of the mere book-worm. Yet 
in his very first chapter, on "Books," after prop- 
erly stigmatizing the modern daily newspaper as 
largely responsible for the neglect of good literature, 
he startles us by proceeding to castigate the public 
library as " another enemy of good books." Though 
thankful for the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the 
Emmanuel Library at Cambridge, and the Harvard 
University Library, he has no good word for our 
Library of Congress, but calls it " that vast dump- 
ing ground for thousands upon thousands of copy- 
righted books ! " However, in his subsequent chapters, 
on literary fame, on an old-time bibliophile (Isaac 
Gosset), on authors and publishers, on the man of 
genius, and on other fruitful themes, he amply 
redeems himself. The public library does have the 
defect of its qualities, all must admit ; and Dr. 
Marvin's is no spiteful attack (like Miss Marie 
Corelli's quarrel with the library as cutting down 
the sale of her books), but a sane and sober expres- 
sion of opinion. He quotes aptly from the ancient 
classics, even printing one considerable passage 
from Marcus Aurelius in the original Greek, and 
also draws on the English poets, notably in his 
excellent chapter on "The Physician and his Work." 
On an earlier page he incidentally enumerates 
seventy-three authors made famous by a single poem 
or song — an interesting exhibit, capable, of course, 
of considerable extension. The book is a worthy 
offering to book-lovers by a book-lover.

was detailed for service in the Far East at the 
beginning of 1904, as second-in-command of the 
cruiser " Boyarin." On the day of his departure 
from St. Petersburg (January 29, 1904) he began 
the keeping of a systematic diary, which was con- 
tinued until his return, December 19, 1905. The 
present volume is written from this diary ; and the 
author assures us that, while he has had no thought 
of writing a history of the war (such a history, he 
rightly observes, cannot be written until a multitude 
of secret instructions and reports shall have been 
made public), he has taken every precaution to attain 
unimpeachable accuracy in his work, and thus to 
contribute material which shall be of first-rate value 
to the future historian. In so far as the claim can 
yet be put to the test, it seems well-founded. In 
any event, the book is a human document of very 
unusual interest. It fairly exudes the Slavic tem- 
perament. Slavic ideas. Slavic aspirations. Easily 
the most striking portion is the ten chapters recount- 
ing the sixteen-thousand-mile voyage of Admiral 
Rojestvensky's Baltic Fleet to Oriental waters, at the 
end of 1904. In a volume published in advance of 
the present one, Captain Semenoff has written of the 
memorable fight off Tsushima, May 22 and 28, 1905, 
in which Rojestvensky's great squadron was totally 
destroyed, so that the book ends at a point just 
prior to the battle. In a series of remarkably vivid 
chapters, however, the author depicts the forlorn 
hope which Russia placed in her ill-equipped and 
antiquated ships, and arouses in the reader a feeling 
of mingled admiration and pity for the heroic men, 
officers, and subordinates, who in the face of an 
impossible task never once lost their morale, or even 
their good humor. The critical historian is likely to 
discount more or less the sort of material contained 
in the volume, and obviously it cannot be infallible. 
But one may expect to get from it more of the real 
flavor of the war-epoch than from any of the more 
formal histories that may subsequently be written. 

linfluencces i n u English Literature in Account 
on Engiuh vnth Religion " (Houghton Mifflin 

Literature. Company) Mr. Edward M. Chapman 

has attempted to indicate the relation of English 
and American literature, mainly of the nineteenth 
century, to religion. The germ of the book was 
presented in two lectures delivered at Yale in 1906, 
entitled, u The Influence of Religion upon English 
Literature During the Nineteenth Century." The 
book is well written, but can scarcely be said to add 
much of value to the growing body of criticism of 
Victorian literature. According to Mr. Chapman, 
religion has influenced nearly every writer of impor- 
tance and a good many of no importance. He takes 
an exceedingly broad view of the scope of religion. 
It is much as if one were to write on English liter- 
ature in account with goodness, or with human 
nature ; or on existence in account with the cost of 
living. Take out of literature all the good qualities 
of men. which religion fosters, and all the conflicts 
of life, in which religion is somehow sure to be a 



factor, and very little is left. In this book religion 
is repeatedly confused with theology. But the 
author scarcely confines himself even to the large 
view of religion that he has here outlined. There 
is more or less on literary technique ; on humor, 
which the author connects with religion as based on 
confidence in the constitution of things ; and on the 
literary movements and tendencies of the century. 
The book thus suffers, we think, from too much 
scattering of shot. If the book was written to 
defend the thesis that religion has greatly influenced 
literature, it is superfluous : for to deny this would 
be absurd. On the other hand, as a sufficiently 
intensive treatment of any one author or any one 
phase of this great subject, it will hardly do. Mr. 
Chapman carefully points out the errors of the Uni- 
tarians (pp. 150f., 339). the one group that comes 
in for correction ; and indulges in his little joke on 
Renan's H Vie de Jesus," which he says is B essen- 
tially a romance, marked by great literary charm, 
and occasional lapses into history." These are 
needless blemishes on an otherwise catholic discus- 
sion. The book is thoroughly readable, and is 
equipped with a good index. 



The life of 
a famout 
Queen. 



Miss I. A. Taylor, to whom we are 
already indebted for several useful 
biographies of interesting queens 
and princesses, has recently added another volume 
to her series, published by the Appletons. This 
time the subject is Queen Christina of Sweden. 
Christina was the daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, 
became queen at the age of six, resigned the crown 
at the age of twenty-seven, embraced the Catholic 
faith, and spent the remainder of her life — thirty- 
five years — in wandering from court to court, 
though her chief abiding-place was Rome. These 
are well-known facts, as are all the facts of Chris- 
tina's life ; u her life, from childhood upwards, was 
lived in public ; she was from first to last a centre 
of interest." In writing her biography the questions 
to consider are, therefore, scarcely of the historical 
sort; they are not problems of data or interpreta- 
tion ; they are rather of the psychological type, 
questions of character and motives. To all these 
problems Miss Taylor finds the solution in Chris- 
tina's singular character, especially in her supreme 
self-confidence which would not permit her for a 
moment to doubt the validity of her own conclusions 
or the expediency of her plans and purposes. This 
faith in self is particularly apparent in her punish- 
ment of Monaldesco, an officer of her household 
who proved a traitor. Christina condemned him 
to death, and the sentence was actually carried out, 
to the great disgust of the French king whose guest 
she was. In spite of her abdication, she considered 
herself an absolute monarch, and refused to be 
bound by the laws of the land where she was in 
temporary residence. Her abdication the author 
attributes to a variety of motives, but especially to 
a longing for a larger liberty than was possible at 
a provincial court where conventions met her at

every turn. The Queen's later efforts to obtain the 
crowns of Naples and Poland, the author does not 
regard with much seriousness : the excitement of 
the canvas and the negotiations brought diversion 
and pleasure ; failure was accepted without apparent 
regret. In her attitude toward her subject, Miss 
Taylor is almost an ideal biographer : she is sympa- 
thetic but not excessively so; she appreciates Chris- 
tina's strong and brilliant qualities, but makes no 
attempt to defend or excuse her eccentric and almost 
lawless behavior. Miss Taylor closes her study of 
this apparently masculine woman with the startling 
conclusion that she was, after all, simply suffering 
from an exaggeration of feminine qualities. " The 
fact remains that in gifts, virtues, deficiencies, 
faults, and failings, she was essentially feminine, 
and never more so than when she masqueraded as 

a man." 

Mr. F. A. Simpson's study of " The 
lf T %uncl7> Rise of L °™ Napoleon " (Putnam) 
is a book that is worth while, for the 
reason, if for no other, that there is literally nothing 
in English which covers the same ground. But it 
has other claims to favor. Few more readable biog- 
raphies have ever been published. From the pre- 
fatory suggestion that his subject would have been 
the ideal pretender if he had only abstained from 
succeeding in his pretensions, to the thrust at Bis- 
marck in the concluding sentence of the volume, 
** But while the dreamer gazed on far horizons he 
stumbled over more than one of the obstacles at his 
feet, and at last fell headlong, tripped by an antag- 
onist who never lifted his eyes from the ground," 
the reader is charmed by an eloquence that is in no 
wise inconsistent with sober and accurate presenta- 
tion of fact. A quotation which supplements the 
prefatory estimate mentioned above may be given as 
completing a striking picture of Louis's character : 
" The very qualities which have made him seem a 
prince among pretenders will hereafter (i. e., after 
he assumes charge of the government) stamp him 
as a pretender among princes." The narrative ends 
with his election to the Presidency of the French 
Republic. An appendix contains a number of sug- 
gestive passages from his early letters, with a bibli- 
ography and an exhaustive index. Unpublished 
sources of information appear below the text, while 
all references to published data are included in the 
bibliography. The volume is generously illustrated 
with photographs and facsimiles from Napoleon's 
correspondence. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Around the World with a Business Man," by Mr. 
Leander A. Bigger, is a work in four handsome volumes, 
with something like two hundred full-page illustrations. 
It is published by the John C. Winston Co. The author 
states that his text has " been compiled from letters 
written to friends at home." He puts it forth with be- 



coming modesty, and claims no attempt "at eloquence* 
wit, or literary excellence." We presume that it will 
find readers, just as the Stoddard and Holmes lectures 
in book-form found readers, and that it will stir in many 
a humble soul yearnings to go forth and see the things 
pictured or described. 

A new edition of Mill's " Principles of Political 
Economy " is edited by Professor W. J. Ashley, and 
published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The 
editor supplies an elaborate introduction and a highly 
useful bibliographical appendix. If our " new " econ- 
omists would really read and digest their Mill, we 
should be spared many of the vagaries that now intrude 
upon our attention and make our study of the subject 
unprofitable. 

"Boutledge's Every Man's Cyclopaedia" (Dutton), 
edited by Mr. Arnold Villiers, is an inexpensive volume, 
moderate as to dimensions, and a veritable multum in 
parvo as to contents. It includes ten sections, of 
which the more important are dictionaries of biography, 
geography, law, synonyms, abbreviations, and " words 
frequently misspelt." There are also " Historical Allu- 
sions," " Battles and Sieges," and other matters. On 
the whole, the book is a useful compendium. 

"Skies Italian" (London: Methuen) is described as 
" a little breviary for travellers in Italy." Less figura- 
tively, it is a selection of poems about Italy, by English 
and American authors, edited by Miss Ruth Shepard 
Phelps. There are about two hundred selections, so 
arranged as to follow the lines of an imaginary journey 
from the Alps to Naples. The tourist who includes 
this little book in his travelling equipment will make no 
mistake, or begrudge the few ounces of extra luggage. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish " The New Inter- 
national Year Book" for 1909, edited, like the two 
preceding volumes, by Messrs. Frank Moore Colby and 
Allen Leon Churchill. The articles in English, French, 
and German literature are written, respectively, by Dr. 
E. E. Slosson, Dr. Albert Schinz, and Frau Amelia von 
Ende. We might particularize further and at great 
length upon other special features of this invaluable 
work of up-to-date reference. It is an enterprise deserv- 
ing of the most cordial welcome and generous support. 

The handsome new " Memorial Edition " of Meredith, 
published by Messrs. Scribner, is making rapid progress. 
During the past few weeks eight volumes have appeared, 
containing " Sandra Belloni," " Vittoria," " Harry Rich- 
mond," "Rhoda Fleming," and "Evan Harrington." 
Each of the first three titles mentioned comprises two 
volumes. Of especial interest are the illustrations, 
consisting of reproductions in photogravure of portraits 
and homes of the author, scenes associated with the 
novels, and in some cases the drawings by Keene and 
Du Maurier which appeared in the first editions. 

"Oxford" editions of the poets are multiplying 
rapidly of late, thanks to the enterprise of Mr. Henry 
Frowde. The latest volumes are " The Complete 
Works of William Shakespeare," edited by Mr. W. J. 
Craig, a volume of over thirteen hundred two-columned 
pages; "The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth," 
edited by Mr. Thomas Hutchinson; "The Poetical 
Works of Sir Walter Scott," edited by Mr. J. Logie 
Robertson; and "The Poetical Works of Lord Byron," 
editorially unacknowledged. In the smaller form of 
"The World's Classics," we have "The Poems of 
Alfred Lord Tennyson, 1830-1865," edited by Dr. F. 
Herbert Warren — a most pocketable volume.

Notes. 



A new " Uncle William " book by Mrs. Jennette Lee 
is announced by The Century Co. It will be called 
'" Happy Island," and will appear early this month. 

Browning's "Men and Women," in a verbatim 
reprint of the original edition of 1855, is one of the 
latest offerings of Mr. Henry Frowde in his tasteful 
series of Oxford reprints. 

At the suggestion of Professor Trent, Dr. Barnett 
Miller of Columbia University undertook, about five 
years ago, to investigate " Leigh Hunt's Relations with l 
Byron, Shelley, and Keats." The resulting monograph, 
a work of much interest and value, is now published at 
the Columbia L'niversity Press. 

Owing to the death of King Edward, it is announced 
by Messrs. Cassell & Company that the new and revised 
edition of their Dictionary of English History, just off 
the press, will be temporarily withdrawn from the 
market. The publishers plan to bring the new edition 
quite up to the accession of King George. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. publish four port- 
folios of plates illustrative of " England in the Middle 
Ages." They are the work of Mr. T. C. Barfield, and 
cover the four centuries from the eleventh to the four- 
teenth. They are inexpensive, and should prove of 
much value as an auxiliary in the work of teaching 
English history. 

From the George H. Doran Co. comes the announce- 
ment of their acquisition of the exclusive selling agency 
for the book and calendar output of Life Publishing Co. 
As still further indication of their progress, this enter- 
prising firm also announces the unification of their 
interests with the publishing business of Messrs. A. C. 
Armstrong & Son of New York. 

During the present month Mr. Cobden-Sanderson 
will issue from the Doves Press the second part of his 
splendid edition of Goethe's "Faust," in the original 
text. Before the end of the year, Mr. Cobden-Sanderson 
expects to have ready also Doves Press editions of 
Browning's " Dramatis Personse," and the " Laudes 
Creaturarum " of St. Francis of Assisi. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's new long novel " Clayhanger," 
soon to be published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., is 
the first of a trilogy of novels dealing with the " Five 
Towns." In "The Old Wives' Tale," Mr. Bennett 
described the old spirit of the central provinces of 
England. In this forthcoming trilogy he will describe 
the breakdown of the old spirit by the new. 

Ex-Mayor Charles F. Warwick of Philadelphia has 
just completed the biography of Napoleon upon which 
he has been at work for some years, and which is to 
be brought out in the Fall by Messrs. George W. 
Jacobs & Co. It is a sequel to the same author's 
volumes on Mirabeau, Danton, and Robespierre, and 
will deal with the close of the French Revolution and 
the First Empire. 

Almost coincident with the recent publication of 
Percy Mackaye's "A Garland to Sylvia" — a play 
begun while its author was a senior in Harvard College 
and not completed until 1899 — comes the announce- 
ment of the enthusiastic reception accorded to his latest 
work " Anti-Matrimony," a satire on the Ihsen school of 
drama which was produced a few weeks ago in New 
Haven. The press has been unanimous in its praise, 
one of the papers declaring that " the play is a com- 
pliment to Americans on their healthy-mindedness." 



Under the editorship of Professor Clarence W. Alvord 
of the University of Hlinois, Messrs. D. Appleton & 
Co. have planned a series of volumes intended to nar- 
rate the history of the development of the West, told 
in biography. Each book will be written from a care- 
ful study of available and original sources. Among the 
subjects of the volumes in preparation are George 
Rogers Clark, William Henry Harrison, John Charles 
Fremont, and Charles Michel de Langlade. 

A complete collection of the poems of the late Sophie 
Jewett will be published in the autumn by Messrs. 
Thomas Y. Crowell & Company. The volume will 
include the lyrics, sonnets, and rondeaus which have 
already appeared in book form; those published more 
recently in different magazines; and a number of 
hitherto unpublished poems. Among these latter is a 
translation of the greater part of D'Annunzio's "The 
Daughter of Jorio." The same firm is to publish 
immediately Miss Jewett's last prose work, "God's 
Troubadour," the story of St. Francis of Assisi told for 
children. 

We have had proof of the quality of Mr. Jethro 
Bittell as a translator of German verse in his volume 
devoted to the Minnesingers, and hence are assured 
beforehand that his " Contemporary German Poetry " 
will give us versions of a superior sort. He appears to 
be one of the chosen in the art of turning poetry from 
one language into another. We do not know many of 
the voung writers upon whom he has drawn, but he 
makes us desire their better acquaintance. The little 
book is published by Mr. Walter Scott as a volume of 
" The Canterbury Poets." 

A complete edition of William Penn's works, long 
desired by those interested in the life and work of the 
founder of Pennsylvania, has been undertaken by that 
well-known historian of the Colonial and Revolutionary 
periods, Mr. Albert Cook Myers, with the cordial 
cooperation of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania 
as represented by a committee headed by the Hon. 
Samuel W. Pennypacker as president, and served by 
Professor John Bach Mc Master in the capacity of cor- 
responding secretary. A prospectus issued by Mr. 
Myers gives, among other interesting information, the 
fact that " only four meagre and antiquated editions of 
the collected works of Penn have been printed, all of 
these in London," at varying intervals between 1726 
and 1825. The proposed plan has the hearty endorse- 
ment of Dr. Horace Howard Furness, Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell, Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, and many 
other scholars and writers of note. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. announce the preparation 
of " The American Year Book," the first volume of 
which, covering the year 1910, will appear in February, 
1911. The aim of the series is to fill the need of an 
annual summary of events and progress — a need which 
has been felt for some years by scientific, historical, 
literary, sociological, economic, journalistic, and other 
workers. While it will be devoted chiefly to American 
affairs, the most important events of foreign progress 
will be fully noted. The organization at present consists 
of accredited representatives or members of twenty- 
nine of the great national learned societies, who act as 
a Supervisory Board, working through an Executive 
Committee of seven, and through the Chairman of the 
Board, Professor Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard 
University. The Board has selected as managing editor 
Mr. S. N. D. North, recently Director of the United 
States Census.

FRANCIS F. BROWNE 

Editor "Poems of the Civil War," "Laurel Crowned

GOLDEN POEMS contains more of everyone's favor- 
ites than any other collection at a popular price, and

The selections in GOLDEN POEMS are classified 
according to their subjects : By the Fireside ; Nature's 
Voice's ; Dreams and Fancies ; Friendship and Sym- 
pathy ; Love ; Liberty and Patriotism ; Battle Echoes ; 
Humor ; Pathos and Sorrow ; The Better Life ; Scat- 
tered Leaves. 

GOLDEN POEMS, with its wide appeal, attractively 
printed and beautifully bound, makes an especially 
appropriate gift.

The One Indispensable 

Medium for Publishers 

of Worthy Books 

HTHIRTY years of continuous publi- 
cation under the same management 
speak for The Dial's stability and 
success. It is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the inter- 
ests of the book class, — the literary 
and cultivated class, the class that buy 
books. It is issued from the second 
largest city in the country, — the centre 
of the immense book-consuming region 
of the Middle West. 



HPHE DIAL is more generally con- 
sulted and depended upon by 
librarians in making up orders for 
books than any other American critical 
journal; it circulates more widely 
among retail booksellers than any 
other journal of its class; it is the 
accustomed literary guide and aid of 
thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country. 



HTHESE facts make The Dial indis- 
putably the foremost medium for 
high-grade advertising, — the one 
indispensable medium for the publisher 
of worthy books.
