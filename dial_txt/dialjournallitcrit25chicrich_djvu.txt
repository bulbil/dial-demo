Richard Harding Davis's New Novel 

THE KING'S JACKAL 

With Illustrations and a Cover Design by CHARLES DANA GIBSON. 12 mo, $1.25. 

IT is evident that Mr. Davis's new story, of an exiled king and his plot to reestablish his financial 
fortunes, will rival in popularity his very successful " Soldiers of Fortune," published a year ago and 
now in its fifty-eighth thousand. The present tale is in many ways stronger than anything tbe author 
has ever written, and the first large edition was exhausted in advance of publication.

L. C. PAGE & COMPANY'S 
NEW FICTION FOR SUMMER READING. 



The Continental Dragoon. 

A Romance of Philipse Manor House, in 1778. By 
ROBERT NEILSON STEPHENS, author of " An Enemy 
to the King." Illustrated by H. C. EDWARDS. 1 vol., 

library 12 mo, cloth. Price $1.50 

A stirring romance of the Revolution, the scene being laid 
in and around the old Philipse Manor House, near Yonkers, 
which at the time of the story was the central point of the 
so-called " neutral territory " between the two armies. 

The Making of a Saint. 

By W. SOMERSET MAUGHAM. Illustrated by GIL- 
BERT JAMES. 1 vol., library 12mo, cloth . $1.50 
"The Making of a Saint" is a romance of Mediaeval 
Italy, the scene being laid in the 15th century. It relates the 
life of a voung leader of Free Companions who, at the close of 
one of the petty Italian wars, returns to his native city. There 
he becomes involved in its politics, intrigues, and feuds, and 
finally joins an uprising of the townspeople against their lord. 
None can resent the frankness and apparent brutality of the 
scenes through which the hero and his companions of both 
sexes are made to pass, and many will yield ungrudgingly 
praise to the author's handling of the truth. 

In Kings' Houses. 

A Romance of the Reign of Queen Anne. By JULIA 
C. R. DORR, author of " A Cathedral Pilgrimage," 
etc. Illustrated by FRANK T. MERRILL. 1 vol., 

library 12mo, cloth. Price $1.50 

Mrs. Dorr's poems and travel sketches have earned for 
her a distinct place in American literature, and her romance, 
" In Kings' Houses," is written with all the charm of her 
earlier works. The story deals with one of the most romantic 
episodes in English history. Queen Anne, the last of the 
reigning Stuarts, is described with a strong yet sympathetic 
touch, and the young Duke of Gloster, the " little lady," and 
the hero of the tale, Robin Sandys, are delightful character- 
izations. 

Bijli the Dancer. 

By JAMES BLYTHE PATTON. Illustrated by HORACE 

VAN RINTH. 1 vol., library 12mo, cloth, . $1.50 

A novel of Modern India. The fortunes of the heroine, 

an Indian Naucht girl, are told with a vigor, pathos, and a 

wealth of poetic sympathy that makes the book admirable 

from first to last. 



Rose a Charlitte. 

An Acadien Romance. By MARSHALL SAUNDERS, 
author of " Beautiful Joe," etc. Illustrated by 
H. DE M. YOUNG. 1 vol., library 12mo, cloth, $1.50 
In this novel, the scene of which is laid principally in the 
land of Evaiigeline, Marshall Sannders has made a departure 
from the style of her earlier successes. The historical and 
descriptive setting of the novel is accurate, the plot is well 
conceived and executed, the characters are drawn with a firm 
and delightful touch, and the fortunes of the heroine, Rose a 
Charlitte, a descendant of an old Acadien family, will be fol- 
lowed with eagerness by the author's host of admirers. 

Sons of Adversity. 

A Romance of Queen Elizabeth's Time. By L. 
COPE CORNFORD, author of " Captain Jacobus," etc. 
Illustrated by J. W. KENNEDY. 1 vol., library 12mo, 

cloth. Price $1.25 

A tale of adventure on land and sea at the time when 
Protestant England and Catholic Spain were struggling for 
naval supremacy. Spanish conspiracies against the peace of 
good Queen Bess, a vivid description of the raise of the Spanish 
siege of Leyden by the combined Dutch and English forces, 
sea fights, the recovery of stolen treasure, all are skilfully 
woven elements in a plot of unusual strength. 

Cross Trials. 

By VICTOR WAITE. Illustrated by W. J. KENNEDY. 
1 vol., library 12mo, cloth. Price . . . $1.50 
A Spanish- American novel of unusual interest, a brilliant, 

dashing, and stirring story, teeming with humanity and life. 

Mr. Waite is to be congratulated upon the strength with which 

he has drawn his characters. 

Bobbie McDuff. 

By CLINTON Ross, author of " The Scarlet Coat," 
" Zuleika," etc. Illustrated by B.WEST CLINEDINST. 
1 vol., large 16mo, cloth. Price . . . . $1.00 
Clinton Ross is known as one of the most promising of 
recent American writers of fiction, and in the description of 
the adventures of his latest hero, Bobbie McDnff , he has re- 
peated his earlier successes. Mr. Ross has made good use of 
the wealth of material at his command. New York furnishes 
him the hero, sunny Italy a heroine, grim Russia the villain 
of the story, while the requirements of the exciting plot shift 
the scene from Paris to New York, and back again to a remote, 
almost feudal villa on the southern coast of Italy.

The Making of Religion. 

By ANDREW LA NO. STO, pp. X.+380, with Index, $4.00. 

.This book examines the prevalent scientific ideas as to 
the origin of the beliefs in the ixml and in God. The result 
of criticism and comparison of evidence, savage and civilized, 
is to indicate that the belief in the Soul is supported by facts 
which Materialism cannot explain. The belief in Qod, again, 
far from being evolved out of the worship of ghosta (M i* 
commonly alleged by anthropologists), is proved to occur 
where ghosta are not yet worshipped. The argument is finally 
applied to the current hypotheses of the origin of the Hebrew 
religion.

Sparhawk," " A Whirl Asunder," etc. 

870, cloth. Price, $1.50. 

Third American Edition. 

THE BOSTON POST says: 

It will make a sensation. Epigrams and wit 
fairly dance before one on her pages. The hu- 
mor of the book is delicious. In this latest book 
Mrs. Atherton is in her most dazzling vein. 

THE NEW YORK HERALD says: 

Mrs. Atherton's book wisely and cleverly dis- 
cusses a problem that has rarely been handled 
with such felicity. More than that, it is a novel 
in which art goes hand in hand with a sufficient 
knowledge of the subject and of human nature 
at large. 

THE MAIL AND EXPRESS says : 

There are in this story humor, healthy satire, 
and much dramatic power. It is the best novel 
that Mrs. Atherton has yet produced.

' Folks from Dixie ' is fresher, simpler, and more 
unstudied than any Southern stories we have 
seen for a long while. Mr. Keinble's pictures, 
like Mr. Dunbar's stories, are the real thing, 
and the book is a unique addition to Southern 
literature. 

THE DETROIT JOURNAL says: 

These stories have the genuine flavor. They 
are taken from life as it exists, and are told in 
a happily unconscious manner by one of the dis- 
enthralled. Mr. Dunbar will write more stories. 
The public will want more.

" A series of adventures as original as they

move rapidly, to glow with genuine fires of 
emotion. . . . The Forest Lovers will be read 
with admiration and preserved with something 
more than respect." New York Tribune. 

JAMES LANE ALLEN writes of It 

" This work, for any one of several reasons, 
must be regarded as of very unusual interest. 
In the matter of style alone it is an achieve- 
ment, an extraordinary achievement. ... In 
the matter of interpreting nature there are 
passages in this book that I have never seen 
surpassed in prose fiction." 

HAMILTON W. MABIE writes 

" The plot is boldly conceived and strongly 
sustained ; the characters are vigorously drawn 
and are thrown into striking contrast. ... It 
is touched with the penetrating power of the 
imagination ; it has human interest and idyllic 
loveliness." Book Reviews.

A CENTURY OF AMERICAN FICTION. 

The American novel is just one hundred 
years old. It took the colonists nearly two cen- 
turies to free their imagination from the phys- 
ical and intellectual trammels imposed upon it 
by the hard necessity of making a virgin world 
into a habitation fit for man, and the still harder 
bondage of a theocratic conception of society. 
As long as the forests remained uncleared and 
the Indians unsubdued, and as long as men's 
minds were under the obsession of a grim the- 
ology, there was little hope for creative litera- 
ture, and the writers who put pen to paper 
were chiefly urged by a desire to take part in 
some ephemeral controversy of religion or poli- 
tics, or, at the utmost, by the hope of emulating 
certain favorite examples of the mother coun- 
try's literary product. Thus the best of our 
early writings were imitative, and imitative our 
budding literature remained until a time within 
the memory of many persons now living. But 
the publication of Brown's "Wieland," in 1798, 
at least marked the beginning of the end of 
our long term of sterility, and this is why it 
becomes appropriate, in 1898, to ask what has 
been accomplished for us by a century of novel- 
writing. 

When we entered upon the first decade of 
the present century, we had nothing to show in 
the form of fiction except the earliest of Brown's 
romances, and two or three such books as 
Susanna Rowson's " Charlotte Temple, a Tale 
of Truth," whose " pages were long bedewed 
with many tears of many readers." But the 
novel-reader of these days was not as insatiate 
in appetite as he has since become, and was 
well content with Richardson, and Fielding, 
and Sterne, and Miss Burney, if his taste were 
of the finer sort ; with Walpole, and " Monk " 
Lewis, and Ann Radcliffe, if his imagination 
thirsted for mystery and gloom. He was prob- 
ably happier with the few books of native origin 
that he did possess than our latter-day readers, 
who get more American fiction than they can 
possibly digest, yet wax indignant because the 
Great American Novel is so long delayed, and 
declaim upon the national folly of our liking 
all good books in the English language, even if 
they are written by our kin beyond seas, or 
translated from the tongues of the stranger. 

It may prove interesting to take the present

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



century by decades, and see what each decen- 
nial period has done for the development of the 
art of novel-writing in the United States. We 
have seen how the account stood in the begin- 
ning ; what had we to show for ourselves ten 
years later ? It is a question easily answered. 
There were the rest of Brown's romances, a 
few such books as Tabitha Tenney's " Female 
Quixotism " and Caroline Warren's The 
Gamesters," and of greater significance than 
anything hitherto done in American letters 
the book which, although not a novel, was to 
prove the starting-point of truly native inspir- 
ation in fiction, the famous History of New 
York " by one Diedrich Knickerbocker. When 
another ten years had passed, the pioneer 
work begun with this delightful piece of quasi- 
historical and humorous fiction was still further 
emphasized by the publication of " The Sketch- 
Book." Of the stories included in this volume, 
Professor Richardson justly says : " They are 
local in scene and character, strong in delinea- 
tion of the personages introduced, and thor- 
oughly artistic in literary form and elabora- 
tion. . . . When to novelty in theme and form 
was added the easy serenity of an assured and 
confident literary touch, American fiction had 
clearly passed beyond the stage of apology and 
curiosity." 

The year 1820 is also noteworthy as the 
year in which " Precaution " saw the light, and 
the most important thing to be said about the 
twenties is that they witnessed the development 
of Cooper's activity at the rate of one new 
novel for almost every year. It was evident that 
America had at last produced a novelist who 
had come to stay, and the acclaim with which 
Cooper was received both at home and abroad 
made it clear enough that the new world was 
ready to provide both the occasion and the 
field, and that men would soon be forthcoming 
to seize upon the one and cultivate the other. 
Meanwhile, " the obscurest man of letters in 
America," as Hawthorne once styled himself, 
was slowly passing through the chrysalis stage, 
and " Fanshawe," the first of his novels, was 
actually written during the late twenties, 
although the public was to know nothing about 
it until many years later, when the fame of the 
author as the greatest of American novelists 
had become fully assured. 

Besides witnessing the continued production 
of Cooper's novels, the thirties brought into 
prominence the name of Paulding, the friend 
and collaborator of Irving, and the one book 
by that writer which still retains a precarious 



hold upon life, "The Dutchman's Fireside," 
bears the date of 1831. The year following 
was the year of " Swallow Barn," which marked 
the beginning of a distinctively Southern va- 
riety of the American novel. Kennedy's slender 
contribution to our fiction falls wholly within 
this decade, as does also the first instalment of 
the romantic fiction that was for thirty years 
to flow in such a stream from the prolific pen 
of Simms. Nor must we forget to mention the 
name of Dr. Bird, if it be only to note the fact 
that the yellow- covered " dime " novel of a later 
generation traced its lineage back to " Nick of 
the Woods " and The Hawks of Hawk Hol- 
low." From the late thirties also date the 
popular " Zenobia " and " Aurelian " of Will- 
iam Ware, which still find admirers, we believe, 
in certain strata of the reading public. When 
this decade came to its close, the " Twice-Told 
Tales," first collected three years before, had 
shown the existence of a hitherto unexampled 
artistic force in American letters, the " Hyper- 
ion " of the year just preceding had given our 
public a faint but charming reflection of the 
romantic movement in Germany, while Poe's 
"Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque " made 
the year 1840 a landmark in the history of our 
fiction. 

The fifth decade was distinguished by noth- 
ing more noteworthy than Herman Melville's 
stories of the southern seas, which appeared in 
rapid succession during these years. But the 
year that stands midway in the century is 
doubly significant, for it was in 1850 that 
Cooper's last novel saw the light, and that The 
Scarlet Letter " the most perfect piece of 
creative literature yet produced iu the United 
States was given to the world. The decade 
of the fifties was dominated by the genius of 
Hawthorne, and brought forward only two new 
names that were destined to outlive their gen- 
eration. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "The 
Virginia Comedians " must be remembered in 
any survey, however summary, of our native 
fiction the one for its immense social influence, 
the other for being, on the whole, the best novel 
produced by the South during the ante-bellum 
period. 

The ten years that included the four of the 
Civil War added several important new names 
to the annals of our fiction, and are certainly 
not chargeable with sterility, even if their lit- 
erary activity did not prove commensurate with 
the expansion of the national consciousness. 
The two famous novels of Holmes, the promis- 
ing tales of Winthrop, the respectable fictions 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



11 



of Bayard Taylor, Dr. Kale's " Man Without 
a Country," Mr. Aldrich's " Story of a Bad 
Boy," and " The Innocents Abroad " make up 
a fairly satisfactory list, while the very last year 
of the decade was that in which " The Luck of 
Roaring Camp " took the public by storm, and 
brought into our fiction a new and resonant 
note of which the echoes have not yet grown 
faint. 

In all our annals there is probably nothing 
more significant than the publication of this 
idyl of the new rough West. It meant, as we 
can see plainly enough after these thirty years, 
that our fiction was about to become intensely 
local and vividly realistic. The fine flower of 
ideal literary art had blossomed and died with 
Hawthorne ; henceforth our novelists were to 
busy themselves with the interpretation of life 
at close range, and were to produce a kaleido- 
scopic body of fiction each bit of which should 
sparkle with its own characteristic and inde- 
pendent color. This is the general formula 
which enables us to include in one category, no 
matter how varied the scene and how diverse 
the accent, the work of Mr. Harte, Mr. Howells, 
and Mr. James, the novels of Mr. Clemens, 
Mr. Warner, Mr. Cable, and Mr. James Lane 
Allen, the countless sketches and social studies 
of Mr. Eggleston, Dr. Mitchell, Mr. Page, 
Colonel Johnston, and Major Kirkland, and 
the charming section of our literature that em- 
braces the writings of Miss Murfree, Miss 
Wilkins, Miss Jewett, Miss French, and Mrs. 
Foote. Compared with this list, which might 
be indefinitely extended with minor yet deserv- 
ing names, the novelists who have eschewed 
realism and stood for the old romantic conven- 
tions are but a small company, and have done 
little to check the tidal movement of the period. 
An entire generation of novel-readers has found 
satisfaction in fiction of the descriptive and 
analytical type, and the inevitable reaction of 
taste sets in so slowly that, although the signs 
have been gathering for several years, the 
changing of the old order has barely begun. 
Such is the history of American fiction, from 
the " Wieland " of 1798 to the Caleb West," 
let us say, of exactly a hundred years later. 



PROBABLY the most satisfactory black-and-white 
reproductions of the principal works in the annual Royal 
Academy exhibitions are to be found in Messrs. Cassell 
& Company's well-known " Royal Academy Pictures." 
The reproductions given are of adequate size, carefully 
printed on fine plate paper, and convey, on the whole, a 
very good idea of the originals. The 1898 edition of 
this work, issued, as usual, in five parts, is now ready. 



THE PASSING SHOW. 

There are two or three features in the dramatic 
season of 1897-98 in Chicago that are worth noting. 
In the first place the season opened with a rather 
remarkable activity in the field of the " American " 
drama, no less than four principal theatres present- 
ing for opening attractions new productions by Amer- 
ican playwrights. The Grand began August 15, with 
" The Hoosier Doctor," by Mr. Augustin Thomas ; 
Hooley's opened the same week with Mr. Louis N. 
Parker's " The Mayflower "; Mr. Clay Clement's 
new play, " A Southern Gentleman," was given at 
McVicker's August 23, and the Schiller Stock com- 
pany made their first appearance August 30 with 
Captain Charles King's " Fort Frayne." Of these 
four plays, the success was moderate, the one last 
named meeting with greatest favor. The " Amer- 
ican " play has remained more or less in evidence 
all through the year. Mr. Clay Clement's ever 
delightful comedy, " The New Dominion," came on 
at McVicker's in September ; and, beginning on the 
27th of that month, Mr. William Gillette's " Secret 
Service " had for six successive weeks or is said 
to have had the most successful run of any play 
in the history of Hooley's Theatre. This was fol- 
lowed immediately, at the same theatre, by " A Vir- 
ginia Courtship," the work of Mr. Eugene W. Pres- 
brey, which won popularity in the hands of Mr. 
William H. Crane, and held the boards three weeks. 
It was a coincidence that brought Mr. Stuart Robson 
to McVicker's at the same time (November 7), in 
Mr. Bronson Howard's old success, " The Henrietta." 
" At Piney Ridge," a play of the Tennessee moun- 
tains, by Mr. David Higgins, came on at the last- 
named theatre, November 28, and was followed by 
Mr. Denman Thompson in " The Old Homestead " in 
December. Mr. Belasco's " Heart of Maryland " 
was at the Columbia during that month also, with 
Mrs. Leslie Carter in the leading role. Mr. Nat 
Goodwin, in " An American Citizen," played at 
Hooley's for three weeks in January, and then pro- 
duced the season's novelty in this field, the heroic 
drama of " Nathan Hale," by Mr. Clyde Fitch. This 
was the most notable event of the year, although 
the success of this interesting effort was not uncon- 
ditioned. Mr. James A. Hearne's always popular 
" Shore Acres " was on at McVicker's for two weeks 
in February, while Mr. Thompson's " Sunshine 
of Paradise Alley " ran coincidently at Hooley's, 
and Mr. Joseph Arthur's " Blue Jeans " came to 
the Schiller, February 20. " Shenandoah," Mr. 
Bronson Howard's effective melodrama, began a 
phenomenal run at McVicker's, May 16, which bids 
fair to outlast the present war with Spain ; special 
features of a spectacular character have been intro- 
duced, and Mr. Otis Skinner appears in the cast. 
" Chattanooga," a new play by Mr. Lincoln J. 
Carter, was put on at the Columbia, June 25. 

So much for " American " drama down-town. 
A study of the attractions presented at the outlying 
theatres shows that the patrons of these latter places

of amusement are fond of native color also. Of 
course in these houses melodrama rules. The titles 
on their bills run thus : " The Brand of Cain," 
' Straight from the Heart," " Humanity," - Land 
of the Living," " Woman in Black," " A Guilty 
Mother," " Fallen Among Thieves," " The Span of 
Life," "The Great Train Robbery," "When Lon- 
don Sleeps," " Under the Polar Star," etc. Spec- 
tacular realism, particularly as developed in Mr. 
Lincoln J. Carter's ingenious plays "The Tor- 
nado," " The Fast Mail," " Under the Dome," and 
others of the same type, " The Operator," " The 
Electrician," " A Midnight Alarm," " The Police 
Patrol," is exceedingly popular; and of course 
plays dealing with the United States Navy, such as 
" The Ensign," " The Man o' War's Man," " The 
White Squadron," have had some vogue. The titles 
here presented are typical of the productions which 
have held the boards at the Academy, the Al ham- 
bra, the Bijou, the Lincoln, daring the season past 
The lover of melodrama is also fond of local settings, 
and Mr. Carter's sensational achievement entitled 
"The Heart of Chicago," in which mechanical 
effects are successfully combined with familiar 
scenes as an ingenious setting for the customary 
plot, is a popular play. " Under the Dome " has 
had a good run ; so also have " McFadden's Flats " 
and " Hogan's Alley." It is natural enough that 
for this class of plays the Eastern metropolis should 
be the favorite among American cities in furnishing 
a locale, and it is amusing to note how these me- 
chanics of art ring the changes on their theme. 
Thus, early in the season came a play called " The 
Wolves of New York "; this was followed by "The 
Streets of New York "; then came " The Pulse of 
New York "; later, " The Sidewalks of New York "; 
and lastly, " Alone in Greater New York." On the 
whole, there is surprisingly little of the morally 
objectionable presented at any one of these four 
houses during the year. The managers appear to 
understand what their patrons want, and supply the 
demand in quality good of its kind. A study of the 
material furnished the people who attend these 
houses is interesting and not discouraging. How- 
ever lurid these dramas may be, the illumination is 
commonly that of honest fireworks, and the smell 
of gunpowder is more wholesome than the fumes of 
more pretentious plays in another class. That there 
are four cheap houses in Chicago which have sev- 
erally supplied melodrama of a legitimate type 
almost continuously for the year, along with Colonel 
Hopkins's excellent play-house serving standard 
attractions of a similar sort, is matter for congratu- 
lation among those who look seriously at the prob- 
lem of public amusement in a great city. 

A year ago we noticed the tendency to go to suc- 
cessful works of fiction for dramatic material. 
Among plays of this class we have had this year in 
addition to " The Prisoner of Zenda," " Under the 
Red Robe," and " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," an 
adaptation of Stevenson's " Prince Otto " in a pro- 
duction entitled " Prince Rudolph," along with 



another dramatization by Mr. Rose, of Mr. Anthony 
Hope's new story " The Adventure of the Lady Ur- 
sula." The success of this last named play, in the 
hands of Mr. Sothern and Miss Harned, fairly 
rivals that of its ever popular predecessor. Two 
other dramatizations proved very effective upon the 
stage: "A Lady of Quality," presented by Miss 
Julia Arthur, and " Tess of the D'Urbervilles," with 
Mrs. Fiske in the title role. The effort to construct 
an acting-play out of "Beside the Bonnie Brier 
Bush " was either ludicrous or pitiful, as the reader 
chooses ; it is proper, however, to chronicle the 
event as one of the novelties of the year. 

The ultimate purpose of this annual review of 
the local dramatic season is to maintain somewhere 
a convenient record of the Shakespearian perform- 
ances in Chicago.* Although the Chicago stage is 
distinctly provincial, this city is nevertheless very 
near the centre of national life, and is perhaps as 
truly indicative of the rise and fall in dramatic 
values as any city in the country. Two years ago 
the city was remarkably fortunate in the numerous 
productions of the Shakespearian dramas and in the 
general excellence of their artistic merit ; there were 
eighty-eight performances recorded for that year 
(1895-96). During the season of 1896-97 there 
were sixty-eight. For the season of 1897-98, 
just closed, only fifty Shakespearian performances 
were given. In each of the previous years, thirteen 
of the plays were brought out ; this season there 
were but ten. " The Comedy of Errors " is the 
only new production of the year. 

Aside from the return to the stage of Madame 
Modjeska in her old-time repertory, the notable 
event of the year was the appearance in September, 
and again in March and April, of Mr. Thomas 
Keene. Now that the season of this popular and 
conscientious actor has indeed closed forever, it is 
pleasant to recall the double visit with its extended 
list of plays ; no less than nine different characters 
were essayed by Mr. Keene.

ian productions for the year.

THE I^AST SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION 
OF INDEPENDENCE.* 



Among the signatures to the Declaration of 
Independence, that of Charles Carroll of Car- 
rollton always attracts attention because of its 
peculiarity. But the individuality of Charles 
Carroll was marked in many other ways. He 
was supposed to be the richest man in the re- 
bellious American colonies, George Washington 
ranking second. The Carrolls in Maryland 
were so numerous that he added the name of 
one of his plantations to properly designate 
himself. Being a Roman Catholic, his acces- 
sion to the ranks of the rebels rebuked those 
Protestants who claimed that the Church was 
hostile to the cause. For the same reason, and 
because he had been educated in France, he was 
chosen by the Continental Congress, although 
not a member of that body, as one of three com- 
missioners to the Canadians in a forlorn hope of 
getting them into the rebellion against the king. 
He was one of the signers of the Declaration, 
but was not present when that document was 
popularly supposed to have been signed on the 
fourth of July. He was the last survivor of 
the signers, and issued a "reaffirmatory declara- 
tion " fifty years after he had placed his name 
to the original. 

In view of his long life, and the part he took 
in the most prominent events of the nation's 
history, the opinions of Charles Carroll would 
be invaluable if they had been preserved. Not 
being a New Englander, he was not trained in 
the duty of keeping a diary ; and, equally un- 
fortunately, he did not even preserve his letters. 
" When those events [of the Revolution] had 
gone by, the matters to which they relate ceas- 
ing to be interesting to the writers, the letters 
were destroyed, at least those that were directed 
to me." 

Had he been more provident, or in the habit 
of reducing his thoughts to writing, he might 
have thrown much light on disputed and obscure 
points. He was present as a visitor when the 
procession of delegates marched from the City 
Tavern to the Carpenters' Hall to organize the 
First Continental Congress, but he left not a 
line concerning it. His timely return to the 
Maryland legislature, after the Canada expe- 
dition, turned the scale for independence, and

CARROLLTON. By Kate Mason Rowland. In two volumes.

he was at once elected to the Continental Con- 
gress and signed the engrossed copy of the 
Declaration. He was a member of the state 
convention which formed a constitution for 
Maryland, and a state senator under that con- 
stitution, as we know from his name on the 
records. He refused to serve on what would 
have been the most important of the many mis- 
sions to which he was called, viz., as a delegate 
to the Constitutional Convention at Philadel- 
phia in 1787 ; yet one can only conjecture the 
reason for his refusal. His name alone tells that 
he was in the Maryland convention where the 
Constitution was ratified by a rather high- 
handed proceeding. He was the first United 
States senator from Maryland, but has added 
little to our meagre information concerning 
those days of closed senate doors. 

Yet a chronologically arranged statement of 
Carroll's services, taken from the records and 
from letters preserved by others, is a veritable 
and desirable addition to historical literature. 
So thorough and systematic has been the search 
already made by biographers, that one can 
scarcely expect to find much new matter con- 
cerning the public life of any Revolutionary 
father. The private letters and papers written 
before entering and after leaving public life 
are likely to be the only reward of the investi- 
gator ; and here the author of the volumes 
under consideration has made a praiseworthy 
contribution. 

The letters written by the father of Charles 
Carroll to his son in European schools show the 
Roman Catholic in a colony supposed to have 
been planted for the freedom of that sect, but 
persecuted by an " established church," de- 
prived of office, obliged to pay double taxes, 
forbidden to give a religious education to his 
children, and his life made so intolerable that 
he contemplates sacrificing his vast landed 
property for the sake of an asylum in some more 
liberal land. Indeed, an ancestor had long be- 
fore changed his motto to " Anywhere with 
liberty," and fled from an intolerant old world 
only to have his descendant find an equal intol- 
erance in the new. A religious as well as civil 
freedom was demanded ; and Charles Carroll 
of Carrollton, hearing the story of colonial per- 
secution from his father, had a grievance which 
easily persuaded him to embark his immense 
fortune in a rebellion against a tyrannical state 
and a tyrannical state church. " To obtain reli- 
gious as well as civil liberty, I entered zealously 
into the Revolution ; and observing the Chris- 
tian religion divided into many sects, I founded 



14

the hope that no one would be so predominant 
as to become the religion of the State." 

Equally interesting are the family letters of 
Carroll after his retirement from public life, 
commenting on the political changes and the 
rising complications of the United States with 
foreign nations. Pleasant glimpses are afforded 
of the daily life of a gentleman of leisure, a fine 
classical scholar, and a devout churchman. 

The rigid requirement of the modern biog- 
raphy, that it give facts instead of eulogy, has 
been well observed by the author. Of the 
equally binding demand that the portraiture be 
unmarred by a foreign background or distracting 
accessories, as much cannot be said. The elec- 
tion of a biography as a vehicle for proving a 
theory is most unfortunate if not unpardonable. 
To attempt to prove now-a-days that our fathers 
thought and spoke of the Union in the plural 
number, is to set up a man of straw for an 
adversary. It smacks of the hair-splitting dead- 
language days of ante-bellum controversy. No 
reasoning man now questions the historical su- 
premacy of the States more than he does the 
necessary supremacy of the Union. The effort 
in the case of Carroll is the more labored be- 
cause he trained with the Union-making Fed- 
eralists. He acted, as did all the fathers, ac- 
cording to the light they then had. To make 
them discern the later contest on this question 
of the supremacy of one of the joint powers, is 
to endow them with the gift of prophecy, a 
height of rhapsody to which the calm reader 
can scarcely be carried by any biographer. 

The author has been unfortunate in trying 
to follow the confused nomenclature of parties 
at the time of their birth, instead of adopting 
the terms now accepted. The attempts to ex- 
plain these distinctions make the confusion 
worse, and at times it is difficult to get the 
intended meaning of the comments. Carroll 
spoke of the Jefferson faction as Anti-Federal- 
ists, although Jefferson denied that he had ever 
been an Anti-Federalist. When Carroll called 
them Democrats he was probably thinking of 
" democrats " men who paraded " under the 
worn-out guise of equal liberty and right, and 
equal division of property, held out to the indo- 
lent and needy ; but not really intended to be 
executed." Jefferson repudiated the title Demo- 
crat, derived from the excesses of the Demo- 
cratic clubs. He adopted the word Republican, 
since he believed in a representative republic ; 
it remained for the rough old " Hickory " Jack- 
son to establish a levelling Democratic party. 

Barring a few minor discrepancies, such as 



the confusion of the date of Carroll signing the 
Declaration (Aug. 2 on page 180 of Vol. 1., 
and Aug. 20 on page 343 of Vol. II.), the edit- 
ing has been carefully and most exhaustively 
done. No one can lay aside these volumes with- 
out an increased respect for this worthy gentle- 
man of Doughrohegan Manor, and of thanks 
to the editor of his life and correspondence.

A MODERN ROMANCER.* 

No literary movement could be more distinct 
than the romantic revival which has come about 
in the past few years and this, in its popular 
and most apparent form, could not be better 
illustrated than by the work of Mr. Gilbert 
Parker. It has, indeed, a side rarer than the 
casual eye can view, and an inspiration too 
subtle for the casual thought to divine, but, as 
generally conceived, it is a revival of wonder 
at the glow and color and splendor of a past 
time, a revival of interest in the epic scenes and 
figures of a younger world. The thousand fine- 
nesses bred of a modern art and thought are, of 
course, admitted, but the movement is compared 
to that which inspired the fiction of the early 
nineteenth century ; and therefore his roman- 
ticism being not unlike that of Scott this 
author is made to represent it, as Scott repre- 
sented the first phase of a greater renaissance. 

It would be easy to say, and is possibly true, 
that the essentials for his type of romance 
remain unchanged, though the forms in which 
they are presented be as different as the Old 
World and the New. The material offered by 
the history of French Canada for action, the 
historic struggle ; for setting, the strange forest 
and ocean ; for atmosphere, the keen wind of 
danger ; and for figures, the seigneur, soldier, 
and lady, the priest and voyageur and coureur 
de bois all this seems not unlike the material 
of the old romancer ; for in analysis we find its 
elements to be the ancient ideal of courage, the 
simple faith of the sword, the deeds of men to 
whom life and death were matters of profound 
simplicity. Yet the difference between the two 
worlds is, perhaps, what gives to our romance its 
distinguishing quality for, when worthily ours, 
it has something of the unexampled freshness, 
promise, power, of a marvellous young conti- 
nent. Here, if we vision it and have strength

to use it, lies the advantage of our material. 

To a certain extent, Mr. Parker has used it. 
His characters, it is true, are not men of intense 
ideals, finding in the wilderness the home of 
religious liberty only men eager for adven- 
ture, explorers, traders, soldiers, ready to fling 
away their lives, some under the lilies of France, 
some under the cross of St. George, to hold the 
land for the king. Yet " trading, fighting, 
revelling " he makes them suggest the fresh 
spirit of their time, the daring dream of their 
new world ; and he gives us, too, a conception 
which, heretofore, the historian alone has given 
the conception of our continent as a great, 
splendid, half-mysterious stage, on which the 
strong nations of Europe were set to play the 
drama of conquest. In all this he proves him- 
self American ; by these signs his work belongs 
to us. 

It is difficult to speak of Mr. Parker except 
as concerning himself with the past, for his 
genius comes to its own in historic epochs and 
among picturesque figures. Of his modern 
stories if they may properly be called such 
" The Trespasser " is the only one which ap- 
proaches in power " The Seats of the Mighty " 
or " The Trail of the Sword " and the chief 
character here is a man from a strange, wild 
country, having Indian blood in his veins, with 
a curious magnetism about him, and with cer- 
tain looks, thoughts, memories, which make 
him almost the incarnation of a far-off ancestor. 
Such a subject, though it presents a deeply 
romantic problem, to which he can not do jus- 
tice and which, indeed, calls for the genius of 
a Hawthorne is not wholly unsuited to Mr. 
Parker's abilities. But when he writes of really 
modern people, he is in a strange air, seeking 
strange gods. It is not that he would give these 
people adventure we are never too civilized 
for that ; but he can not present modern men 
and women in adventure, and when he essays 
to do so is either theatrical or dull. Even the 
speech of the modern is not his ; he has skill 
in dialogue, but it must be such dialogue as 
that between Captain Robert Moray and Mon- 
sieur Doltaire, eighteenth-century soldiers and 
gentlemen, or as that between the sprightly 
English Jessica and young Iberville, envoy 
from Count Frontenac to the English governor. 
In short, he must have, for the proper exercise 
of his art, material which is innately picturesque 
and impressive. With such stuff to work upon, 
he is not theatrical, but dramatic ; it lends itself 
to his style, which, though simple, has a roman- 
tic glow and suggestiveness ; and his thrilling, 



imaginative phrases " The Seats of the 
Mighty," " The Porch of the World," As 
Water unto Wine," "The Gates of Misfor- 
tune " are entirely suited to it. The very char- 
acter of the French people, and the vividness 
of their speech and manner, give him warrant 
for certain emotional scenes. Iberville, saying 
to Frontenac, " Once, sir, you made it a choice 
between the woman and the sword," and press- 
ing his lips to the sword's hilt-cross, is not unreal, 
but simply un-English. Nor is Alixe Duvar- 
ney unreal when she tells how, at the palace 
of the Intendant, to a roomful of banqueters, 
she played the part of danseuse, in order to 
save her lover. Indeed, in Mr. Parker's mas- 
terpiece, from which this last example is drawn, 
there are none but the most legitimate effects, 
and there is a real delicacy of touch, a great 
dignity of narration. 

The time is not so far past when no one cared, 
or dared, to tell these heroic tales, and when 
our art was fearful lest, by chance, it should 
create an impressive character. The change to 
this romanticism has been very marked, and 
from the extreme which Mr. Parker represents 
we must expect some backward swing to 
heroisms finer than those of the sword, and to 
adventures whose end is greater than the con- 
quest of provinces. But there can hardly come 
a time when we shall not find something thrill- 
ing in the wide canvass of early America, and 
something poetic in the stalwart figures that 
people it, no matter what their ideals.

niece, and privately printed in the first instance, 
are the personal recollections of a very clever 
woman despite Dr. Johnson's dictum that none 
but a blockhead ever wrote except for money. 

Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus, after- 
ward Mrs. Henry Smith of Baltiboys, was, the 
publishers inform us, of the same branch of 
the Grant family from which our own General 
Grant claimed descent. Lady Strachey, wife 
of Sir Richard Strachey and a kinswoman of 
the Grants, has edited the memoirs. They 
cover the years from 1797 to 1880, although 
the writer, who died in 1885 in her eighty- 
ninth year, brought them down to a much later 
date. Her father, Sir John Peter Grant, a 
gentleman of considerable property, an advo- 
cate by profession, and in later life appointed 
to " a judgeship in Bombay," led a restless, 
roving life, as did his family with him. Hence 
the variety and interest of the " Memoirs," and 
the allusions to countless places and persons of 
note. Life at Oxford in 1810, the installation 
of Lord Grenville as chancellor of the Univer- 
sity, reminiscences of Shelley's student days at 
this period, a sojourn at Windsor, anecdotes of 
Lord Jeffrey, a reference to Sir Walter Scott 
as seen in society, the hair-raising terrors of 
the Indian jungle, the awful fury of a tropical 
storm, a visit to Waterloo, and one to St. Helena 
a few years after Napoleon's death, these and 
a thousand other matters lure the reader on 
from page to page. A single passage, in con- 
clusion, concerning Sir Walter Scott may be 
welcome : 

" I was never in company with Walter Scott; he went 
oat very little, and when he did go he was not agreeable, 
generally sitting very silent, looking dull and listless, 
unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance. 
In his own house he was another character, especially if 
he liked his guests. It was odd, hut Sir Walter never 
had the reputation in Edinburgh he had elsewhere 
was not the lion, I mean." 

The life of the Earl of Shaftesbury, by Mr. 
Edwin Hodder, in three bulky volumes, pub- 
lished in 1886, is so well known that the pres- 
ent outline of the " good " Earl's work as a 
social reformer calls for but a brief, though a 
heartily commendatory, notice. The growing 
interest taken in social questions in recent 
years, to the increasing exclusion of purely 
political ones, is in no small measure due to 
Shaftesbury's lifelong labors to better the con- 
dition of the English laboring classes. Receiv- 
ing no sympathy, and, it would seem, scarcely 
any love from his parents, the wonder is that his 
nature, instead of being embittered and hard- 
ened in youth, developed such all-embracing 



warmth and affection as characterized his mani- 
fold activities in the cause of social reform. 
Refusing high offices, honors, and a handsome 
income, he labored under a burden of financial 
embarrassment and in the face of persistent 
and often malignant opposition, but with un- 
faltering devotion, first in the House of Com- 
mons, and then, upon his father's death in 1851, 
in the House of Lords, to secure much-needed 
legislation for the protection of the laboring 
classes, the poor and the unfortunate. Factory 
hands, miners, brick-makers, chimney-sweeps, 
agricultural laborers, lunatics, flower girls, 
shoe-blacks, and countless others, profited by 
his exertions. Active personal examination 
and inspection of mines, factories, asylums, 
schools, and a hundred other institutions, were 
added to his official duties in Parliament ; tak- 
ing nothing upon hearsay, he desired a minute 
personal knowledge of all abuses calling for 
correction. The magnitude of his labors and 
the vast number of good causes initiated or 
encouraged by him almost passes belief ; and it 
was said of him that his speeches in behalf of 
each of these reforms made his hearers believe 
him solely and entirely engrossed in promoting 
that particular reform, as the one great work of 
his life. " Love, serve," was his ancestral 
motto ; and nobly did he live up to it. The 
book, handy, clearly written, and inspiring, will 
be especially welcome to those unable to own 
the author's more extended life of Lord 
Shaftesbury. 

Again the anonymous author of the " Prig " 
books and of an entertaining life of Sir Kenelm 
Digby, already reviewed in these columns, 
comes to the front with a life of Lucius Gary, 
second Viscount Falkland, preceded by a briefer 
account of Henry Gary, the first viscount. He 
declares his book to be written with a purpose 
" to amuse its author "; and, as often hap- 
pens, in recording what amuses himself, the 
writer has succeeded in amusing his readers. 
Elizabeth Tanfield, wife of Henry Gary, claims 
no small part of the reader's interest. When 
only ten years old, so keen-witted was she that 
she saved the life of a poor woman on trial for 
witchcraft ; but the story is too long to give in 
full, and will not bear cutting. The charm and 
value of the book lie in its treatment of what 
might be considered unimportant details ; for, 
as the author says, " the minor details of the 
past are rarer than the major, and . . . often 
help to illustrate the period in which they have 
occurred." The writer deplores his inability to 
enliven his pages with any anecdotes of Lucius

Gary's and Letice Morison's love-making ; and 
so the element that contributed so much to the 
picturesqueness of the career of Kenelm Digby, 
his contemporary, is entirely lacking in the 
present volume. But the same devotion to 
scholarly pursuits, so common with noblemen 
of that period, is found in the lives of both. 
The second Viscount Falkland was an excellent 
classical scholar, a poet not without recognition, 
the author of " A Discourse on the Infallibility 
of the Church of Rome," and the supposed joint 
author of Chillingworth's " History of Protest- 
antism." In his learned seclusion at Great 
Tew, where he was visited by the chief men of 
letters of his time, he presents a pleasing pic- 
ture. A common saying of his, " I pity un- 
learned gentlemen in a rainy day," is worth 
remembering. In public life his going over 
from Parliament to King was redeemed by his 
fidelity to the latter, even unto death. He was 
killed at the battle of Newbury, after showing 
himself a brave soldier. While not a great 
contribution to historical literature, the present 
volume brings together, in convenient and 
attractive form, much that has hitherto been 
scattered and more or less inaccessible. After 
Matthew Arnold's estimate of Falkland as a 
" martyr of sweetness and light, of lucidity of 
mind and largeness of temper," this his latest 
biographer cannot surely be accused of undue 
prejudice in favor of his hero. 

As a general rule, a voluminous autobiography 
(not a posthumous one), embellished with two 
portraits of its author, and containing chapters 
on " The Work of My Life Recognized " and 
" Testimonies to My Life's Work," is not ex- 
actly the kind of book one feels a burning desire 
to read and a hungry eagerness to possess. 
And when it is discovered that a good portion 
of the book has to do with an academy presided 
over by the writer and brought more promi- 
nently to the reader's attention by means of 
photo-engravings, the volume begins to be sug- 
gestive of an elaborate advertisement, and the 
longing to explore its pages assumes a still 
more negative character. Yet Dr. Porter's life 
has been full of action and incident, and his 
work, both in the church and in education, has 
been of great value to his State and to the 
South generally. But when we encounter such 
frank instances of self-glorification as this sen- 
tence on page 253, " The class of the refined 
and educated was to be saved to the South 
through my efforts," we feel that the author 
is far above the need of any praise from us.

RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL,.* 

Quite the most notable recent book on Asian 
travel is " From Tonkin to India," by Prince D'Or- 
leans. This elaborate work describes a journey 
made, in company with two fellow countrymen, from 
Tonkin to India, by way of lower Yunnan and 
Thibet and Upper Assam, largely through little- 
known country, and to some extent through country 
previously unvisited by Europeans. The aim was to 
find <k the shortest route from China to India," and 
to explore the Chinese Mekong and the sources of 
the Irawadi, and in all this he was successful. Much 
of the travelling was over very rough ground, and 
on the borders of Assam the party reached what the 
author called " the acme of cumulative obstruction." 

" Up to the present we had overcome many a spell of 
choice obstacles. They had not exhausted the vagaries 
of nature. Indeed, they might be looked upon rather 
as the occasional rockets of the entertainment, and this 
as the feu d? artifices. Jagged points, slippery surface, 
crumbling brinks, creepers that tripped, worm-eaten 
trunks up which to swarm, almost vertical ladders to 
climb formed of wooden pickets driven in the face of 
overhanging bluffs, often hauled by the sheer strength of 
a couple of men and liana drag-ropes over boulders. We 
struggled on because we had to, and sat down abruptly 
on the other side, to marvel how the deuce we got there. 
Let anyone who wants good training for biceps or calf 
come here. A mile or two in a day was sometimes all we 
could do, and at this rate we began to despair of seeing 
India in 1896." 

The author's accounts of his struggles through this 
mountainous region and his descent into the plains 
of Assam are much the most interesting parts of the 
book. The larger part is a rather dry summary, 
too sketchy, desultory, and matter-of-fact to be of 
the highest interest. The writer is too lacking in 
graphic vigor, humor, and spirit of adventure for 
its own sake, to give his experiences literary charm. 
He alludes in high terms of praise to Mr. Rockhill, 
the American explorer, whose name, however, he

spells "Rochill." He speaks bitterly of English 
aggression, bat cannot conceal his admiration of 
English administration. The good maps, the artis- 
tic illustrations, and the scientific appendices add 
much to the value of this work. 

Through Finland in Carts," by Mrs. Alec 
Tweedie, is an entertaining account of quite an ex- 
tended trip along the eastern shore of the Baltic, 
with special facilities for studying the home-life of 
the people. The title, however, is somewhat of a mis- 
nomer, as the journey was mostly made by boats. 
Mrs. Tweedie saw much of the life of the upper 
classes, of the peasantry, and of the clergy. She 
thus describes a country church service : 

" The church held nearly 4000 people, and every man 
and woman present was a peasant. The building was 
crowded to excess, the sexes being divided by the centre 
aisle. Nearly every one wore black, that being consid- 
ered the proper wear for Sundays, weddings, etc., espe- 
cially for the married women, who also wore black silk 
handkerchiefs over their heads. Each woman carried 
a large white handkerchief in her hand, upon which she 
leaned her head while praying. Subsequently we found 
that all the females rolled their prayer-books up in these 
cloths while carrying them home. Service had begun 
at ten, so that three hours of it was over when we ar- 
rived, and the Communion, which lasted another hour 
and a half, was about to begin. The place was packed, 
the day very hot, and the peasant atmosphere a little 
oppressive. We were much struck by the children; 
mere babies actually being nursed by their mothers, 
while elder urchins walked in and out of the building 
going sometimes to have a game with various little 
friends amidst the graves outside, plaiting daisy-chains, 
or telling fortunes by large ox-eyed daisies. The men 
walked out also, and enjoyed a pipe or gossip with a 
neighbor, and there was that general air of freedom 
which prevails in a Roman Catholic Church during 
divine service; nevertheless, the intense sympathy, the 
devotion, the general inclination to moan and weep, 
reminded us of the Highland Kirk. But it was very 
surprising to hear the pastor tell his congregation that 
at a certain day he would be at an appointed place to 
receive grain, butter, potatoes, calves, etc. The clergy- 
men are paid in kind, which to them is a very suitable 
arrangement, as they are generally peasants' sons and 
well able to attend to their own glebes; but it did sound 
funny to hear a clergyman, standing in the pulpit, talk 
of butter and eggs. When the congregation stood up 
we naturally stood up with them. The Findlanders are 
short; and for two women five feet six or seven high, 
with bats on the tops of their heads, suddenly to rise, 
amazed a congregation the female members of which 
were seldom taller than five feet one or two, and wore 
nothing on their heads but a flat handkerchief. We 
felt like giraffes towering over the rest of the people, 
and gradually grew more and more ashamed of our 
height and hats, simple though the latter were. How 
we longed to be short and have our heads covered with 
black silk handkerchiefs like the rest of the folk around, 
so as to be unnoticeable in their midst." 

Everywhere Mrs. Tweedie enjoys her travel experi- 
ences and slight adventures with a rare zest, which 
she is very successful in communicating to her 
readers. While this work cannot be accounted a 
finished literary performance, nor a very notable 



and thorough account of the Finnish land and peo- 
ple, it is yet an extremely bright, pleasant, merry 
book, a thoroughly popular travel book of the best 
sort. The volume is handsomely got up, and is pro- 
vided with a good map and interesting illustrations. 

The late Charles A. Dana's volume of " Eastern 
Journeys " is a very slight collection of notes de- 
scriptive of a flying trip through Russia, Trans- 
Caucasia, and Palestine. These notes are too brief 
and cursory to be of much importance, though their 
very recent date may give them some value for cer- 
tain purposes, as for intending tourists. The book- 
let is well written, and the notices of Tiflis and the 
Darial Pass, which places are somewhat out of the 
beaten route, are of considerable interest 

Mr. G. W. Steevens, a correspondent of a London 
paper, gives us, in the book entitled " With the Con- 
quering Turk," a spirited and interesting account of 
the recent Turko-Greek affair. Mr. Steevens started 
from Salonica, where, strange to say, he found the 
majority of inhabitants Jews, and " the reigning 
speech old Spanish." He accompanied the Turkish 
forces throughout the brief campaign, which he 
characterizes as not " really war " but a political 
demonstration. " It began as the servant of diplo- 
macy, instead of its master, as war should be ; so it 
went on. Everybody had his eye on the Concert of 
Europe and the terms of peace." Mr. Steevens 
greatly admires the fighting qualities of the Turk. 
As evidence of this we quote his vigorous descrip- 
tion of the storming of Vasili by the Turks. 

" They heard the bullets cracking past like whips, and 
the shells screaming like mad horses; they saw their 
comrades fling wild arms abroad and lurch forward 
onto their faces. Yet these indomitable men never once 
moved out of their steady slouch. ' Allah ! Allah ! 
Allah! ' they cried, with a fierce but a very self-contained 
enthusiasm, as they tramped first through deep corn and 
then out over the bare plough. ' Allah ! Allah ! Allah! ' 
the sound swelling and mingling to a hoarse roar as 
they lined out into open order and began firing quickly 
but not hurriedly. 'Allah! Allah! Allahl' as the jets 
of fire ran more clearly round the village, and men went 
down beside them, and the bullets kicked up little dust- 
devels between their legs. And Allah saw them through. 
The Greeks bolted. I doubt if they lost a man, for the 
Turks looked to shoot very high. But they saw their 
masters coming, and they went to kennel. They could 
not stand there and face those slipshod heroes shambling 
composedly forward past death to victory." 

While Mr. Steevens's style is in general good and 
vivid, it sometimes is marred by flippancy, and some- 
times the constant staccato effect becomes weari- 
some, especially where he is tempted, as the corre- 
spondent must be, to merely - make copy." But on 
the whole the work is to be commended as a clear, 
careful, and readable account; and the excellent 
maps add much to its usefulness. 

Mr. Henry M. Stanley's latest contribution to 
African subjects, entitled " Through South Africa," 
consists of brief and cursory letters descriptive of a 
trip to Bulawayo on the opening of the railway last 
fall, and includes also some material relating to a 



1898.]

visit to the Transvaal. Mr. Stanley thinks that 
Bulawayo is destined to become the Chicago of 
South Africa ; and as to the situation in the Trans- 
vaal he is even abusive of Kriiger and his policy. 
This little book is certainly acute and suggestive, 
and though it cannot be called dispassionate, it will 
serve as an introduction to the present status of 
South Africa for those who have not time or inclin- 
ation for larger works. 

The present complication with Cuba will draw 
attention to such books as " Marching with Gomez," 
by Mr. Grover Flint. This book, though made up 
of the author's letters to a New York paper, is de- 
cidedly superior in matter and form to the usual run 
of this kind of publication. It is a plain direct nar- 
rative, unsensational, and apparently truthful and 
impartial. As throwing some light on the state of 
the Cuban insurgents and on the nature of Spanish 
rule, it is of considerable value. Mr. Flint finds 
that the fighting Cubans are disdainful of autonomy 
and of annexation, but wholly bent on absolute 
independence. The historical introduction to this 
book, by Mr. John Fiske, is of decided value, and 
the sketches and maps are of interest. 

The book on Alaska, by the Hon. A. P. Swine- 
ford, is the result of personal observation in all 
parts of that vast territory. It is much better than 
the usual run of books on the subject, and furnishes 
a useful and apparently trustworthy compend. The 
Klondike region is included in the survey. The 
description of the Indians of Alaska, though sum- 
mary, is of value. The book has a good map and 
fair illustrations. 

Mr. J. W. Tyrrell's " Across the Sub-Arctics of 
Canada " is a very modest and simple narrative of 
an exploring trip made in 1893 through the Barren 
Lands adjacent to Hudson Bay. The expedition was 
sent out by the Canadian Government, to discover 
a water route from Black Lake, which is just above 
Lake Athabasca, to Baker Lake at the head of 
Chesterfield Inlet, and Mr. Tyrrell accomplished 
this by a canoe journey, interrupted by frequent 
portages, along river and lake for 810 miles through 
an unknown country. He returned late in the au- 
tumn, by a very perilous coasting trip along Hudson 
Bay to Fort Churchill. Mr. Tyrrell came in con- 
tact with both Indians and Eskimos. To the Eski- 
mos he devotes two chapters, which, though contri- 
buting little that is new, are yet fresh with personal 
observation. He describes the Mackenzie River Es- 
kimos as " wearing stones in the cheeks, upon each 
side of the mouth." They " have the reputation of 
being a bad lot, and it is said when they are heard 
to rattle their cheek stones against their teeth it is 
time to be on the lookout. The stones are cut in 
the shape of large shirt studs, and are let through 
the cheeks by cutting holes for them." The book 
is suitably illustrated from photographs, and it has 
a sketch-map of the author's route. 

In " The Isles and Shrines of Greece " Mr. S. J. 
Barrows discourses very pleasantly and enthusias- 



tically of Greece old and new. He includes in his 
survey the most famous and beautiful of the Isles 
and Shrines in the Ionian Islands, the Peloponne- 
sus, Phocis, Thessaly, Attica, the JEgean Islands, 
and Troy. Some of his pilgrimages were made 
under the leadership of the renowned Dorpf eld, who 
lectured to his students in the midst of the very 
ruins he described. A suggestive remark is this : 
" In modern times we build churches where we 
think people will resort to them ; in primitive days 
of nature-worship the Greeks built their altars where 
they thought the gods loved to come." Mr. Barrows's 
brief, genial, unpedantic sketches may well serve as 
a popular intoduction to classical Greek archaeology 
in the light of the most recent investigations. Chris- 
tian archaeology is touched upon, and the Greek life 
of to-day is clearly described. The photographic 
illustrations are very good, but there is no map. 

"Brown Men and Women," by Mr. Edward 
Reeves, is an account, rather glib and desultory, of a 
hasting traveller to the usual ports in the South Seas. 
The Friendly Islands, Samoa, the Fiji Group, the 
Cook Group, and the Society Islands are described 
in a light and lively vein ; but we regret to say that 
the temper shown is often unscientific and the tone 
vulgar. At the most, the author gets but glimpses 
of Island life ; yet he writes in a most assertive and 
even pugnacious manner, as witness particularly his 
savage denunciation of the missionaries. And yet, 
as a recent sketch of the status of Polynesia, the 
book has considerable value and interest. It has no 
general map of the route, but is provided with nu- 
merous and striking illustrations. 

Much the best of recent books on Alaska that we 
have met with is " Through the Gold-Fields of Alaska 
to Bering Straits," by Mr. Harry De Windt. Mr. 
De Windt, who is evidently a professional traveller, 
attempted a journey from New York to Paris by 
land ; but he succeeded only in reaching Fort St. 
Michaels, on the Yukon, where he learned that 
Bering Straits were not practicable for a crossing on 
the ice. So he had recourse to the U. S. Steamer 
" Bear," which landed him at Oumwaidjik, on the 
Siberian side of the Straits. Here he was in virtual 
captivity among the Tchuktchi savages for some 
months, vainly endeavoring to get forwarded to Ana- 
drysk. Matters finally began to look serious ; but 
he was at length rescued by a passing whaler. Mr. 
De Windt's story of his Tchuktchi experiences is 
extremely interesting, though we suspect that most 
readers will be chiefly attracted by the first part of 
the book, wherein is a vivid account of the Klon- 
dike region, through which the author passed, by 
way of the Chilkoot pass, not long before the great 
gold discoveries. Alaska he regards as " one of the 
few countries of the world where, so far as travelling 
facilities are concerned, money goes for nothing. 
Here all grades are equal, from the government 
official to the San Francisco tough.' " The journey 
to Dawson City he describes as " passed under cir- 
cumstances compared to which the roughest work

place " the trail lies through a dense, swampy forest, 
and half the distance is barely covered when we are 
literally driven back by clouds of mosquitoes. The 
air is black with the pests, which attack as with 
almost alarming ferocity. For the first time I no 
longer doubt Cooper's assertion that the strongest 
men sometimes break down and give way to tears 
under their sufferings." Mr. De Windt greatly ad- 
mires the Alaskan scenery, which resembles Switzer- 
land. The account of the Klondike country is brought 
down to date. We can recommend this book as a 
very capable and entertaining book of travels. It 
is well furnished with illustrations and with a map 
of the route, and the paper and the presswork are 
a delight to the eye. HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

My story will take you into times and spaces 
alike rude and uncivil. Blood will be spilt, virgins 
suffer distresses ; the horn will sound through wood- 
land glades ; dogs, wolves, deer, and men, Beauty 
and the Beasts, will tumble each other, seeking life 
or death with their proper tools. There should be 
mad work, not devoid of entertainment ... I 
hope you will not ask me what it all means, or what 
the moral of it is. I rank myself with the historian 
in this business of tale-telling, and consider that my 
sole affair is to hunt the argument dispassionately." 
Thus are we introduced to the tale of " The Forest 
Lovers," by Mr. Maurice Hewlett, whose " Earth- 
work out of Tuscany " some time ago prepared a 
receptive audience for whatever he might choose to 
write. It is difficult to characterize this new book,

so far does it depart from the ordinary conventions 
of romance, so filled is it with the sense of a close 
communion with nature, and so radiant with sheer 
imaginative beauty. It is one of those rare produc- 
tions that compel immediate acceptance as literature 
in the classical meaning of the term, and silence all 
critical questionings by the supreme excellence of 
the achievement which they embody. Some notion 
of what it is may perhaps be conveyed by asking 
the reader to think of a romance by William Morris 
blended with the high spirits of a Zenda tale. It 
has the grace of the one and the action of the other, 
and its local habitation is as far to seek as in either 
of these illustrative cases. Whether we are to think 
of France or England when absorbed in its pages 
matters but little, and our fancy is left free to range 
through the centuries of medieevalism if we even 
care to wonder into what particular period of the 
world's chronicle we are transported. The book is 
a joy to read and to remember, a source of clean 
and pure delight to the spiritual sense, a triumph 
of romance reduced to the essentials, and interpreted 
with a mastery of expression that is well-nigh be- 
yond praise. 

Both fiction and actual life have afforded numer- 
ous instances of love affairs between Englishmen 
and Japanese maidens, and the novelists, at any rate, 
have usually given an ideal coloring to the relation, 
and sought in the comparison to put our Western 
loves to shame. It is evidently for the purpose of 
showing the other side of the shield that Mr. Carlton 
Dawe has written his story of " A Bride of Japan," 
and, although we think he has exaggerated the con- 
sequences of this particular form of mixed marriage, 
it is undeniable that he has given a powerful por- 
trayal of the situation from his own point of view. 
The book is unpleasant, yet one that we would not 
have missed reading. 

Mrs. Humphry Ward's new novel, " Helbeck of 
Bannisdale," comes to our table unheralded by the 
puff preliminary or other cheap devices for creating 
an anticipatory prejudice in its favor, and the fact 
that it has gone hastily through the press is evi- 
denced by a proof-reading so careless that we find 
it difficult to recognize the workmanship of a pub- 
lishing house whose name usually stands for the 
most fastidious accuracy in the mechanical details 
of book-making. Perhaps the first thing to say about 
the book considered as literature is to record the 
fact that it harks back to Mrs. Ward's " Robert 
Elsmere " period, and marks the abandonment for 
the time being of her concern in the social prob- 
lems of the time. The problem here presented is 
the religious one, and, as before, the religious prob- 
lem in its inmost spiritual essence, while the conflict 
in the present case is sharper than that to which 
Robert Elsmere succumbed, and the issue more 
tragic. In the earlier work, we were made to con- 
template the struggle of a strong intellectual nature 
with the blind forces of religions dogmatism, and 
the outcome left the hero morally triumphant 
although physically overthrown. In the present 



1898.]

instance the antagonism is between a woman bred 
in the atmosphere of rationalism, strong indeed in 
will, but without the intellectual equipment she so 
sorely needs, and the most rigid and exacting form 
of Catholic belief. The conflict proves too unequal 
for the heroine, and she finds refuge only in self- 
destruction. That two strenuous natures, differing 
radically in their religious views, cannot find even 
in the strongest love for one another the bond neces- 
sary for happiness seems to be Mrs. Ward's thesis ; 
and out of this fundamental intellectual incompati- 
bility her tragedy springs. This difficulty has formed 
the basis of many a novel before " Helbeck of Ban- 
nisdale," and as usually presented we have fre- 
quently had occasion to describe the resulting es- 
trangement as morbid if not absolutely immoral. 
We hesitate to use such terms to characterize the 
solution here offered, for, however untypical, we 
feel that Mrs. Ward has created for us two human 
beings whose conduct, under the given circumstances, 
was nothing less than inevitable. " Love is enough " 
is a formula that will not fit with Helbeck and 
Laura ; but we are constrained to say, while admit- 
ting the full importance of the religious tempera- 
ment in sweetening life and strengthening character, 
that it is fortunate there are few fanatics of Hel- 
beck's sort, and few women with Laura's unbalanced 
nature. Yet Helbeck commands our admiration, 
much as Dr. Ibsen's Brand demands it ; and the fact 
that the moral triumph remains with him rather 
than with her is a conspicuous illustration of the 
fairness with which Mrs. Ward has handled a contro- 
versial matter which clearly enlists her sympathies 
upon the other side. As far as development of the 
action goes, many of her pages might be spared, for 
she has not been able to keep the philosophical es- 
sayist out of her book. But these superfluous pages 
are so ripened in thought and so chastened in sym- 
pathy that from another point of view we would not 
willingly miss them. That this novel overshadows 
all but the very best of contemporary fiction goes 
without saying. 

" The Making of a Prig " is a charming story 
compounded of strictly familiar ingredients. A 
young man is laid up by accident in a country town, 
and comes under the ministrations of a young girl, 
too innocent to know that all the while she is read- 
ing and talking with him she is also falling in love. 
He, on the other hand, is interested and amused by 
her fresh and emotional nature, and anticipates 
nothing serious. Afterwards, she goes to London 
in search of employment, impelled not by necessity 
but by a quixotic impulse to do something for her- 
self, and has all the harrowing experiences of which 
we have so often read. There is also a country 
youth, affectionate and slangy, who loves her in a 
dumb sort of way, but clearly has no chance after 
the brilliant stranger has appeared upon the scene. 
The latter discovers, in the end, that the feeling of 
camaraderie has given place to something deeper, 
and the story closes happily, after the proper series 
of prettily pathetic passages. The title is hardly 



justified, for the heroine is nowise priggish in any 
ordinary sense, but a very sweet girl, swayed by 
natural impulse, and womanly in the best meaning 
of the term. 

"Seiiorita Montenar " should prove a popular 
book just now. It is about Spaniards and war- 
ships and fighting, and other subjects that engage 
the mind of the excited public. The fact that it 
relates to the Chilean war of independence does not 
make any real difference, for Chileans and Cubans 
are much the same thing, and American readers 
dearly love to take a whack at Spanish tyranny 
anywhere. It is, moreover, an admirable story of 
its sort, brim full of perilous adventure, and placed 
amid scenes sufficiently novel to give it an added 
zest. The days of the great O'Higgins live for us 
again in these pages, and the heart warms to the 
new world patriotism of his followers. We commend 
Mr. Crouch's story to amateurs of romantic adven- 
ture. 

Mr. Robert Hichens, after essaying with doubt- 
ful success one or two forms of serious fiction, has 
again opened the vein of social satire which won 
him his reputation with " The Green Carnation," 
and produced one of the most entertaining books 
that we have read for many a day. " The Lon- 
doners " has all of the epigrammatic wit that made 
Mr. Hichens seem so preternaturally clever in his 
first book, and it has, in addition, enough of a plot 
to stimulate the interest, and keep the reader from 
being merely dazed by the incessant heat-lightning 
of the author's satirical fancy. The treatment is so 
broadly farcical that the book cannot be called a 
novel in any serious sense, but it is rarely amusing 
for all that, and makes the best of reading for an 
idle summer day. 

" The Story of a Play " is a pleasing addition to 
the list of the charming trivialities to which Mr. 
Howells has chiefly devoted himself of late years. 
It now seems a confirmed habit with him to select 
for treatment some closely circumscribed phase of 
experience, to make it the subject of the most search- 
ing and minute observation, and to develope its 
utmost possibilities. This intensive method of lit- 
erary cultivation is the method best calculated to 
yield artistic results ; and, if the recent work of Mr. 
Howells does sometimes suggest the carving of 
cherry-stones, the carving is very neatly done. Few 
subjects are more hackneyed than that of the bud- 
ding man of letters seeking to make his way in an 
unappreciative world, and it requires some daring 
to bring it once more into service. In the present 
case, the aspirant for fame pins his fortunes to play- 
writing, which gives the author an opportunity to 
introduce the chief types of player-folk into his 
pages, and to illuminate their ways with many a 
flash of gentle humor. By making the wife of the 
hero collaborate in the work of writing the play, 
Mr. Howells is enabled to add to his collection an- 
other of those examples of femininity that usually 
prove so exasperating to the sex that they assume 
to represent. It is all very well by way of semi-

satirical pastime, but women are sometimes rational 
beings, the score or more of Mr. Howells's novels to 
the contrary notwithstanding. 

A book by Colonel Richard Malcolm Johnston is 
always welcome, even if it be, as in the case of 
" Pearce Amerson's Will," only the repnblication 
of a novelette that has already done duty in the 
pages of a monthly magazine. While not equal to 
the author's strongest work "Widow Guthrie," 
for example, the present story is charmingly writ- 
ten, of geniality all compact, and an admirable pic- 
ture of manners in Georgia half a century ago. In 
this field Colonel Johnston is without a rival ; there 
is no other writer living who has his freshness of 
recollection combined with his instinct for the effec- 
tive form of literary expression, and his books are 
at the same time acceptable works of fiction and 
important historical documents. 

We have often wondered why, in the present 
revival of historical romance, the age of the Italian 
despots should not have been made to furnish forth 
a greater proportion of our current literature. 
The Elizabethan dramatists well knew the value of 
this material, but the Victorian novelists have made 
slight use of it. To be sure, we had the other day 
a romance dealing with the conspiracy of Fieschi 
and the despotism of the Doria, and Mr. Clinton 
Scollard now gives us a romance of Gian Galeazzo 
and the conquest of Milan, but there is room for 
many more workers in this attractive field. Mr. 
Scollard's book is neither good nor bad. It follows 
a familiar plan, is correctly elaborated in accord- 
ance with the literary tradition which it affects, dis- 
plays some knowledge of the period concerned, and 
is written in a careful and fluent style. 

Few historical figures so lend themselves to the 
purposes of romance as does that of Henry of 
Navarre, and we are not surprised to find still an- 
other novelist attracted by that theme. In " The 
King's Henchman," Mr. William Henry Johnson 
tells a tale of the conventional pattern, neither better 
nor worse than fifty others that have recently been 
told, dealing with subtle intrigues and fierce battles, 
the woes of a persecuted damsel and the bravery of 
her chosen champion. For once, however, the hero 
does not get his reward, and is left disconsolate in 
the end a fact which will hardly recommend the 
romance to the sort of audience for which all such 
romances are written. 

We find it difficult to rediscover in " The Con- 
tinental Dragoon " the author of " An Enemy to 
the King." In that spirited piece of fiction we had 
swift dramatic action and a reasonable degree of 
romantic probability. In the new novel, on the 
other hand, we have a situation so improbable that 
even the most hardened reader of this sort of book 
remains in a constant state of revolt, while the nar- 
rative is so clogged in its action by the historical 
material introduced that the reader loses patience 
completely. It takes some fifty pages of undigested 
Colonial history to get the story fairly started, and 
the feeling of exasperation caused by this unhappy 



overture is not abated when the preposterous nature 
1 of the plot begins to be unfolded. There are a few 
j pages of brilliant writing in the book, but they do 
not make up for its general shapelessness. 

" At the the Sign of the Silver Crescent," by Mrs. 
Helen Choate Prince, is the third novel by this 
attractive and thoughtful writer. Like its two pre- 
decessors, it deals with the subject that Mrs. Prince 
seems to have made her own French life as it 
exists in the provinces rather than in the capital. 
While the characterization is superficial, and the 
criticism of life somewhat narrowed, rather by the 
obvious limitations of the writer than by the exigen- 
cies of her theme, there is a well-managed plot, and 
the interest is maintained at a moderate tension 
throughout the work. The book is pleasing rather 
than strong, better fitted for entertainment than for 
illumination. 

" Soutien de Famille," the novel completed for 
publication by Alphonse Daudet not long before 
his death, is now published in an English transla- 
tion, and bears for a title "The Head of the Fam- 
ily." The translation is by Mr. Levin Carnac, and 
is far from being a good one. The charm of the 
author's style has almost wholly evaporated during 
the process, and there are even occasional lapses 
from ordinary correct English. The novel, which 
is here prefaced by Professor Cohn's sketch of 
Daudet which first appeared in " The Bookman," 
will make no perceptible addition to the author's rep- 
utation. Being by Daudet, it is, of course, an admir- 
able piece of work, but it does not retain the fresh- 
ness of the earlier masterpieces, nor is it really 
worthy of Daudet from the standpoints of construc- 
tion and characterization. The hero is a worthless 
fellow, consumed by vanity, and falling without 
effort to resist into a vicious life. It is only ironically 
that he is " soutien de famille," and the real burden 
of sustaining his widowed mother is left to the so- 
cially unattractive younger son, who bravely accepts 
the responsibility, and is too stupid to understand 
the despicable character of his brilliant elder brother. 
The final act of the hero, who enlists because nothing 
else is left him to do, is a mere piece of sentimental 
bravado, and does nothing to rehabilitate his char- 
acter in the mind of any intelligent reader, although 
we rather suspect that the author intended the act 
to have some such effect. The delicious inconse- 
quence of the hero's closing injunction, to the effect 
that his son be not allowed to study Latin, is but 
one instance out of many which go to show how 
much of its old-time cunning was lost by the hand 
of the author during the years of suffering that 
brought his life to its term. 

" The Disaster," by MM. Paul and Victor Mar- 
gueritte, is an act of piety rather than a work of art, 
a day-by-day chronicle of the war between France 
and Prussia rather than a piece of historical fiction. 
It has even less of artistic quality than M. Zola's 
La I )i : li;"idi;." and that work is defective enough 
in construction. But " The Disaster " is so sincere 
a book, and succeeds in so enforcing both tin- hor-

rors of war in the abstract and the lesson of the 
degradation wrought in France by twenty years of 
a corrupt Empire, that it becomes impressive by 
sheer accumulation of detail and weight of moral 
earnestness. It deals chiefly, as the translator tells 
us in his well- written introduction, with the opera- 
tions of the army of the Rhine, " the long agony of 
the finest troops in the French army, day after day 
duped until the fatal hour of the capitulation of 
Metz by Bazaine." It is, moreover, the story of the 
conflict from the officer's point of view, the story of 
gradual disillusionment, of growing despair, and of 
the birth of a new resolve in the younger genera- 
tion, the resolve to create a new and better France 
out of the wreck of the old. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



In a monograph on Charles the Great 
in the "Foreign Statesmen" series 
(Macmillan), Mr. Thomas Hodgkin 
well sustains his reputation as an accurate and en- 
tertaining writer of history. His excellent choice of 
language, together with a comprehensive historical 
knowledge which enables him to impress his facts 
by means of historical comparisons and contrasts, 
makes the book delightful and profitable reading. 
These historical parallels, which the author finds so 
readily, serve not only to heighten the interest but 
to fortify the memory and stimulate the ambition 
for further reading. For example, commenting 
upon the similarity of the policy of Clovis with that 
of Napoleon, Mr. Hodgkin says : " Both men em- 
phatically fought ' for their own hands '; both were 
more intent on massing great countries under their 
sway than on really assimilating the possessions 
which they had already acquired ; both in different 
ways made, or tried to make, the Catholic Church 
an instrument of their ambition ; and both seemed 
to have looked upon Europe, or so much of it as they 
could acquire, as a big estate to be divided among 
their children or relations." What could more 
clearly picture the personal, non-national character 
of the policy of Clovis, or more certainly impress 
the memory? While the life and government of 
Charles the Great are described with simplicity and 
accuracy, the most valuable chapters in the book are 
devoted to the later Merovingians, and to the Mayors 
of the Palace. The position in the government held 
by these mayors, whether in Neustria or Austrasia, 
their powers, their limitations, and the conditions 
which led to a decrease of their control in the one 
state and an increase in the other, are matters which 
few historians have been able to state clearly. Mr. 
Hodgkin, briefly, but with ample reference to and 
quotations from early authorities, has made plain 
much that has heretofore been only indefinitely 
stated. Although the title of the book is Charles 
the Great, the more familiar compound, Charle- 



magne, is used, in spite of the teaching of the late 
Professor Freeman, who first protested against this 
form of the name. The author's reason for some- 
times Gallicizing the title of the great Teutonic hero 
is that the name commonly used " by its union of 
the Teutonic Karl with the Latin Magnus not 
inaptly symbolizes the blending of the German and 
Roman elements in the Frankish Empire." 

Only the trite remark that " it reads 
like a romance" can properly de- 
scribe the autobiography of the Chev- 
alier de Pontgibaud, a French volunteer of the 
American War of Independence (Appleton). After 
numerous adventures, including an escape from 
prison in his native France, the author arrived a 
penniless adventurer in America and became a pro- 
tege of the chivalric Marquis de la Fayette at 
" Valley Forges." He followed the fortunes of the 
Revolutionary War, was present when Andre* was 
captured, and finally saw Rochambeau wave the prof- 
fered sword of Cornwallis toward General Washing- 
ton. He returned to France in time to be driven 
out in the French Revolution, and came back to 
America to join the colony of Emigres who embraced, 
in their new stations, farmers, merchants, market 
women, and an elephant exhibitor. The changed 
fortunes of the royalists after the fall of Napoleon 
restored the Chevalier to a quiet life in France, and 
gave opportunity of writing his reminiscences. The 
easy style in which these are composed gives pleasant 
little glimpses of those personalities which are com- 
monly cloaked by the glamor of heroes. At one 
time, being with Lafayette in a vessel off the coast 
of New Foundland and threatened with death in a 
violent storm, he relates that the young Marquis, 
who was very seasick in addition to his other woes, 
began to philosophize " on the emptiness of glory 
and fame. * Diable ! I have done well, certainly. 
At my time of life barely twenty years of age, 
with my name, rank, and fortune, and after having 
married Mile, de Noailles, to leave everything and 
serve as a breakfast for codfish ! ' " But a kind fate 
restored him to the arms of the surprised Madame 
de la Fayette, who was brought by Queen Marie 
Antoinette in her carriage to meet him. 

Col. Higginson's Of the principal movements in life 
" Cheerful and letters in the last three-quarters 

Yesterdays." Q ^ig cen tury, perhaps no man now 
living can say more truthfully than Mr. Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson, " All of which I saw, and 
part of which I was." Moreover, few are masters 
of such a happy art in narration ; consequently, Mr. 
Higginson's "Cheerful Yesterdays" (Houghton) 
would be hard to surpass as a book of reminiscences. 
Without falling into undue discursiveness on per- 
sonal matters, the author contrives to throw that 
light upon his period and locality which it is the 
special merit of books of this class to bestow. Life 
at Harvard College, when Commencement Day was 
such an event that Boston banks were closed and

Boston gentlemen repaired to Cambridge to keep 
open house while the ceremonies lasted ; American 
literature coming to its birth through the cohesion 
of those six leaders whom we still count as our 
greatest, yet who were so unlike in many ways that 
we were spared any clique or a literary yoke of any 
kind ; the unquiet epoch of the Transcendental- 
ists," these and other things are portrayed with a 
picturesqueness all the author's own, and in a way 
to emphasize the great changes of our time. But 
our author has been no less closely in touch with 
affairs than with literature. The born reformer is 
shown in his eager part in the fugitive slave epoch, 
in the Kansas struggles, in the John Brown episode, 
in the Civil War as colonel of the first colored regi- 
ment, in every recent progressive movement in the 
halls of legislation in his own State. Naturally, one 
who has seen the accomplishment of so many good 
things is optimistic in regard to the future ; and the 
full text of the Wordsworth lines which furnish the 
title are entirely applicable : 

" A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays. 
And confident to-morrows." 



It would hardly be fair to the authors 
ITS.TJ *"""* of "Under the Stars, and Other Songs 

of the Sea" (Way & Williams) to 
delay mention of their little book until it shall be 
convenient to survey the poetical product of three 
months or more in our usual way. These verses 
are intended for immediate 'consumption, being songs 
and ballads of the American navy, written to meet 
a pressing need for war poetry ; and Messrs. Wallace 
Rice and Barrett Eastman, who have thus oblig- 
ingly assumed upon short notice the difficult role of 
American Campbells, have every right to expect a 
responsive welcome for their efforts. The two col- 
laborators in this production have written eight 
poems apiece, most of them bearing the marks of 
haste, yet spirited, breezy, and not unsatisfying 
withal. " The First American Sailors," by Mr. Rice, 
is a really fine ballad, and is likely to be remem- 
bered. We also like Mr. Barrett's " Brothers of 
One Blood," both for its form and its sentiment. 
These seem to us the best of the poems, although 
there are several others that we have read with a 
considerable degree of pleasure. 

Tkt t*ppre*titm The suppression of seriousness among 
oftervnunru women particularly among college- 
among women. WO men and club -women is the 
motive of a little volume by Mrs. Helen Watterson 
Moody, entitled The Unquiet Sex " (Scribner). The 
author adopts, perhaps as suitable to this purpose, 
a popular manner of airiness and inconsequence ; 
ahe makes, here and there, a radical mistake, 
as in asserting that the typical woman-collegian 
goes in for reforms "; and club- women may claim, 
with a show of reason, that her view of their clubs 
is not a broad view. Nevertheless, she speaks some 
certain truths, for example, that the modern wo- 
man is still " on nervous tiptoe "; that club-work is 



apt to be taken with too much gravity ; and that the 
college-girl is conscious of her type, but will cease 
to be when her grandmother is known as a bachelor 
of arts. There are also some sensible things in the 
little book which are not of the nature of accusations. 
Such is the contention that " no club can do more 
than receive the result of individual scholarship and 
culture, or offer more than mere stimulation "; and 
such, too, is the statement that, in any field of work, 
an emphasis on the fact that women are new-comers 
must tend to the lowering of wages. The preface 
gives fair warning that the author will speak on but 
one side of the subject, and it is probably for this 
reason that nothing is said of the club-member who 
takes her club easily, or of the college-girl who is so 
fearful of being considered " serious " that she goes 
to unnecessary lengths of flippancy. The attitude 
of the book is quite clearly indicated by the an- 
nouncement that it is " for men, women, and the 
Unquiet Sex." By some strange lapse into serious- 
ness, it has marginal notes. 

One does not read far in Mr. Lau- 
wnce Button's A Boy I Knew, and 
Four Dogs " (Harper) before discov- 
ering that the Boy " in evidence was none other 
than the author himself. The sketches originally 
appeared in " St. Nicholas," and may be read with 
pleasure by old and young. Mr. Hutton seems to 
have been in the main a boy of the usual type, what 
is approvingly called a " regular boy," and to have 
had the "regular boy's " stock experiences, such, 
for instance, as falling in love with a girl much older 
than himself. Mr. Button's flame was called Phoebe 
Hawkins he remembers putting himself on record 
at the time as ' loving his love with an F, because 
she was Feeby." Mr. 1 1 niton's retrospect is tinged 
with a quaint humor that savors a little of Mark 
Twain, yet there is a manifest note of tender senti- 
ment throughout. A number of family portraits, 
evidently from old daguerreotypes and photographs, 
form a novel feature of the little volume. 



Intide views of 
railroad life. 



The good graphic quality and rugged 
realism of Mr. Herbert Elliott Ham- 
blen's On Many Seas " are again 
manifest in his capital picture of the career of a 
- railroad man " entitled The General Manager's 
Story" (Macmillan). While the story is cast in 
the form of fiction, the experiences are, we should 
judge, real, and the writer's own, though this 
assumption involves the inference that he has been 
a " railroad man " as well as a sailor. At any rate, 
the book is a most realistic one, showing an intimate 
knowledge of the life and the characters it portrays. 
A number of spirited illustrations materially enliven 
the text. _ 

Some of the late George Du Maurier's

specimen drawings are given, in which Keene's 
artistic superiority to his popular predecessor on

are mostly slight things, but the fun conveyed is 
always kindly and wholesome, if sometimes rather 
mild even for " Punch." There are three por- 
traits in the volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Dr. and Mrs. Frankland's memoir of Pasteur (Mac- 
millan) is a model of biography. Clear, concise, and 
complete, it photographs the man without using the art 
of the retoucher, and tells the story of his achievements. 
As recorded on his mausoleum in the Institut Pasteur 
in Paris, these were investigations of molecular dissym- 
metry, 1848; fermentations, 1857; generations called 
spontaneous, 1862; maladies of wine and beer, 1863-71 ; 
diseases of the silk worm, 1865; infectious plagues and 
immunity against them, 1877-80; protection against 
hydrophobia, 1885. Any one of these should have 
insured his fame. 

Mr. Paul Leicester Ford has many titles to the grati- 
tude of students interested in American history, and 
none more clear than that which is due him for his edi- 
tion of " The Federalist," just published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. in a volume of eight hundred pages. 
Mr. Ford has gone very thoroughly into the questions of 
disputed authorship, and provided a great variety of 
apparatus including an extensive and searching index. 
The work is admirably done in all important respects, 
and should be upon the desk of every teacher of Amer- 
ican constitutional history. 

" Allen & Greenough's Csesar " is sadly familiar to 
many generations of inappreciative schoolboys, and they, 
at least, will hardly give a cordial welcome to the new 
edition of the work, now published by Messrs. Ginn & 
Co. " To satisfy the ever-increasing demands of mod- 
ern secondary education " has been the aim of the editors, 
who are three in number, Messrs. B. L. D'Ooge and 
M. Grant Daniell having aided Professor Greenough in 
bringing the text and the apparatus up to date. The 
volume, although devoted to " The Gallic War " alone, 
now extends to over six hundred pages, and is very 
thoroughly illustrated.

Cringle's Log," is also announced by the same firm. 

Messrs. Luzac & Co., London, send us the bound vol- 
ume for 1897 of their monthly " Oriental List." It 
makes a convenient reference catalogue of the year's

manent value. 

The " Introduction to the Study of English Fiction " 
(Heath), which Professor W. E. Simonds published two

" The Spaniard in History " (Funk), by Mr. James C. 
Fernald, is a small book, setting forth the traditional 
English view of Spanish history, and having much to say 
about Spanish atrocities committed in past centuries. 
It is a book intended for popular consumption, and the 
bias of the author is almost as evident as if he were 
writing for a yellow newspaper.

friendly interest in everything going on around him, 
and listens attentively when I read to him. He espe- 
cially likes to hear French, but I do not think he can 
follow me. Besides, I dare only read a short time, so 
as not to tire him. He by no means makes the impres- 
sion of an insane man. His eyes are beautiful and clear. 
He has retained much of his old dignity and elegance, 
but he speaks little, and the paralysis shows itself in his 
heavy and unsteady gate and movements. He is per- 
fectly ignorant of the awful fate that has befallen him, 
and this fact I feel to be a great comfort. He cannot 
bear tears, and has often said to me reproachfully, ' Why 
are you weeping, my sister ? We are happy, are 
we not ? ' "

THE SINGER 

Automatic Chain-stitch 
Sewing-Machine. 
Highest type for all purposes in which a 

chain-stitch can be used. Owing to the simple 
design, the small number of wearing parts, 
and superior material and workmanship, it is 
of remarkable durability and efficiency. 

Especially distinguished for compactness, absolute 
noise lessness, and light-running qualities. 

Adapted to a wide range of work, upon almost any 
variety of fabric. Its capacity under the arm is greater 
than that of any similar machine. 

The frame is cast in one piece, and is remarkably 
rigid and free from vibration. The feed has a positive 
motion, and the length of stitch is easily adjusted with- 
out use of springs. 

The automatic tension always supplies exactly 
the correct length of thread for each stitch, and requires 
no adjustment.

THE NATION'S NAVY. ._ II 

Our Ships and Their Achievements. By Charles Morris. 

I2tno. Clotb, illustrated, $1.50. 

OUR ships of war are the one subject about which the people of this country are coming to speak 
and think by day and dream by night ; in which they are the most deeply interested, and of which 
they are growing to be the most proud. Ten yean ago we bowed our heads in shame when our 
navy waa spoken of. To-day we have, for its size, perhaps the finest navy in the world. Ten years from 
to-day we shall likely have one of the largest, and be able to victoriously contest the sea with far mightier 
nations than Spain. In this volume is given an admirable presentation of the American navy, including 
its history, from the first shot of the Revolution to the sinking of the Maine ; a lucid description of the 
development of the modern types of war vessels, and a detailed account of all the ships that make up the 
navy of the United States. To those who wish to know of what a modern navy consists, what is meant 
by conning tower, turret, barbette, rapid-fire guns, torpedoes, mines, the resistance of armor and the 
penetration* of projectiles, and all the multitudinous matters which have to do with modern naval science 
and engineering, this book may be heartily commended. In short, it is a museum of all that concerns 
the American navy, alike in its history, its ships, and its development 



THE AMERICAN IN PARIS. 

A Biographical Novel of the Franco-Prussian War. 
The Siege and Commune of Paris from an Amer- 
ican Standpoint By Eugene Coleman Sav- 
idge, M.D. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00. New Edition. 
Paper, 50 cents. 

" Mr. Savidge takes up his story in 1870, and carries 
it through to the end of the ruthless Commune, a 
story so thrilling, so interesting, that criticism forgets 
her part and allows us to wander on and on through the 
sorrows of a living woman's life, until the inevitable 
shock brings us to our senses." Public Ledger. 

FOR FREEDOM'S SAKE. 

By Arthur Paterson, author of " A Son of the 
Plains," " The Daughter of the Net Percea," etc. 
(In Lippincotf s Series of Select Novel* for July, 
1898.) 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. New Edition. 
Paper, 50 cents. 

" The intensely dramatic life of John Brown in Kansas 
daring the Free Soil Straggle of 1856 is the basis of 
Arthur Patenon's ' For Freedom's Sake.' The excite- 
ment of the times, well portrayed, carries the reader 
breathlessly along the current of the story, while through 
it all runs the stern, courageous morality of the great 
reformer that lends a noble thrill to the interest it 
arouses and holds. Certainly this is one of the best tales 
that has reached us this fall." New England Magazine. 



POOR MAX. 

By lota, author of " A Yellow Aster." (In Lip- 
pincott's Series of Select Novels for June, 1898.) 
12mo. Cloth, $1.00; paper, 50 cents. 
The author of " A Yellow Aster " already has a wide 
public among readers of fiction on both sides of the sea. 
Hence this second book from the same pen will be read 
with the double interest of contrast with the earlier suc- 
cess and of curiosity concerning its own plot and char- 
acters. These both sustain the reputation already 
acquired by Iota, and it will be surprising if many 
readers do not give the palm to " Poor Max." With all 
the cleverness of its predecessor, it has a substantial 
quality of its own. 

A DESERT DRAMA. 

Being the Tragedy of the Korosko. By A. Co nan 
Doyle. 12mo. Cloth, ornamental, with thirty- 
two full-page illustrations, $1.50. 
" A. Conan Doyle has a splendid chance to use his 
descriptive powers, and splendid material to draw con- 
trasts in nationalities and to compare civilization with 
barbarity. This he has done very successfully, and the 
' Desert Drama ' forms an interesting narrative. Be- 
sides his splendid description of the desert, and bis por- 
traiture of the cruel Dervishes and their fierce religious 
teal, the author has given each of his characters a dis- 
tinctiveness which is worked out very cleverly."

ANNO UNCEMENT. 



By arrangement with Messrs. Herbert S. Stone 
& Co., the owners of " The Chap-Book," the sub- 
scription list, the name, and the good-will of that 
publication have been purchased by THE DIAL, 
which will fill out all subscriptions. The last issue 
of " The Chap-Book " was that of July 1. The 
magazine was first published on May 15, 1894, in 
Cambridge, Mass., by Messrs. Stone & Kimball, 
both members of which firm were then undergrad- 
uates in Harvard College. It was in form a small 
duodecimo pamphlet, issued semi-monthly, and was 
at first meant to be little more than an attractive 
kind of circular for advertising the books published 
by the firm. But its instant and somewhat unex- 



pected popularity led its publishers at once into an 
attempt to make the magazine an organ of the 
younger American writers, and a means of intro- 
ducing to the public new and curious developments 
in foreign literatures. " The Chap-Book " was either 
praised as being up-to-date, or denounced as being 
" decadent," and had considerable vogue. Publica- 
tions which were evidently imitations of it, both in 
form and spirit, sprang up in many quarters, and its 
editors have collected something like one hundred 
and fifty of these curious ventures. 

In October, 1894, the periodical was removed 
from Cambridge to Chicago, and since that date 
has been continuously issued from the latter city on 
the first and fifteenth of every month. May 1, 

1896, it was transferred by its original owners to 
the new publishing firm of Herbert S. Stone & Co. 
It has been edited from the start by Mr. Herbert S. 
Stone, with the assistance of Mr. Bliss Carman 
at the beginning, and of Mr. Harrison Garfield 
Rhodes during the last four years. In January, 

1897, " The Chap-Book " was enlarged to quarto 
size, and introduced reviews of current literature as 
a prominent feature of its contents. This change 
brought with it a marked increase of dignity and 
authority ; it became more serious than it had been, 
yet it did not cease to be entertaining. Editorially, 
it was conducted with independence and vigor, and 
occupied to a considerable extent a field which it had 
made its own. One hundred numbers were issued 
altogether, sixty-four in the smaller and thirty-six in 
the larger form. When purchased by THE DIAL, 
four numbers of the ninth volume had appeared. 

" The Chap-Book " has had a distinguished list of 
contributors, including most of the poets, novelists, 
and essayists, both of England and the United 
States, whose names are widely known to the read- 
ing public, and its pages have furnished forth the 
contents of several volumes of stories and essays. 
We take much pleasure, upon this occasion of join- 
ing its fortunes with our own, in paying this tribute 
to its sturdy and valuable services in behalf of good 
literature. 

By this accession THE DIAL gains a new and 
important constituency, which it will of course seek 
to make permanently its own. While features likely 
to increase its interest and value may be added, this 
journal will in the main adhere to the well-defined 
aims and principles which have governed it for 
nearly twenty years and have given it the favor and 
support of the literary public of America.

LOCAL COLOR AND ETERNAL TRUTH. 

Literature is an artistic product, as truly as 
sculpture or architecture. All the fine arts 
have for their aim perfection of form, the crea- 
tion of beauty, but, to a Puritan at least, 
nothing seems permanently beautiful which 
fails to suggest heroic human endeavor. Ar- 
tists must, indeed, take their material, and in 
some degree their suggestions, from their indi- 
vidual and local environment. Yet of all crea- 
tive work, the expression of thought in language 
is least limited by space or time. The Erech- 
thenm is a ruin, and can never leave its deso- 
lated Acropolis ; the Vatican torso has outlived 
its proper setting it stands lost and dethroned 
in a gallery of antiques ; but Homer remains 
crowned and serene, as clear-voiced as ever, in 
far higher honor, indeed, than the singer in his 
lifetime can ever have dreamed of being. Still, 
all the creations of genius are imperishably 
beautiful. Perhaps their greatest helpfulness 
to men lies precisely herein : that they lift us, 
in imagination, quite out of all the cramping 
limitations besetting our daily routine out 
of mere reality into the ideal world. 

Possibly no group of creative writers ever 
fitted more naturally and easily into their set- 
ting than the authors of Concord, Cambridge, 
and Boston. Yet, while Emerson and his friends 
will always be known as the New England poets, 
their origin, their life, their influence is neither 
chiefly sectional nor even merely national. New 
England did not create them, did not own them, 
cannot contain them. As truly as that earliest 
singer whose time is disputed, whose name is 
denied, and to whose wide-wandering ghost an 
earthly abiding-place will doubtless never be 
granted, so these whom we fondly call our 
own are in truth a treasure forevermore. 

Nor do we turn to them chiefly, or most con- 
fidently, for a better knowledge of New England 
life. Sir Launf al is at least as precious to many 
of us as 'Zekiel, or as Hosea himself ; Donatello 
and Miriam outshine the paler pair of our own 
folk standing beside them. Whittier himself 
has sung Stonewall Jackson's march through 
Frederick, and even the relief of far-off Luck- 
now, more thrillingly perhaps more truly 
than Floyd Ireson's ride. 

It has sometimes been proposed, as a grace- 
ful tribute to our most popular authors, that 
their statues should be set up in public parks, 
surrounded by the ideal beings who are the 
creatures of their genius. In Longfellow's 
case this would surely include Hiawatha and 



his Minnehaha, Evangeline and Gabriel, per- 
haps also that kingly pair, Robert of Sicily and 
Olaf the Dane ; certainly we could not spare 
dear Elsie, who offers her young life so gladly 
for her prince, in the Legenda Aurea. Yet 
these favorites are almost wholly folk who never 
could have breathed our air, or understood a 
word of our speech. 

What is so evidently true of this poet (still 
the dearest to the national heart) is quite as 
true of the masters in fiction everywhere. A 
great author never merely sketches such an 
individual man or woman as he and we 
have known. Every true stroke delineates more 
the universal than the particular. Is Andro- 
mache a Grecian like her minstrel, a Trojan 
like her husband, or the Cilician daughter of 
Ee'tion ? No one ever cared to ask. She is 
the type of sorrowing wifehood in the bitter 
hours of war and bereavement. As in Homer's 
day, so in ours. Romola, Miriam, and even 
Lorna, are neither living individuals nor racial 
types. They are merely typical woman-souls. 
Each is an ideal of nineteenth-century woman- 
hood ; but we are made to see, too, how in her, 
as in us, all the past experience of humanity is 
crystallized into expression, all serener future 
possibilities are foreshadowed. 

The same test may be safely applied even to 
the prince of artists. Ophelia has no Danish 
feature, Juliet is Italian only in her absolute 
impulsive naturalness : it never occurred to us 
that Rosalind is a French demoiselle ! Neither 
has the great magician metamorphosed them 
all into English girls, and assigned them to the 
Elizabethan age or to any other generation. 
They abide in a fairer land than merry En- 
gland or sunny France, in statelier homes than 
Veronese palace or royal castle of Denmark : 
for they dwell lovingly together in the noble 
realm of art and ideal beauty. That which is 
most precious, and most lasting, in a poem, a 
tale, or even an essay, is least distinctively En- 
glish, or American, or French. It is " Euripides 
the Human," Montaigne the human, Burns the 
human, whose influence lives and works long- 
lasting as the world. 

The " Scarlet Letter " has a vivid local set- 
ting, and so has " Heart of Mid-Lothian." 
Neither is a masterpiece merely, or chiefly, 
because it is a more or less accurate study of 
Puritanism in New England, or of Scottish life. 
Hawthorne's genius (and perhaps Scott's also) 
is revealed, rather, in the treatment of that 
most universal of problems, the vain attempt 
to escape from the inherent penalty of sin. As

Rembrandt throws the high light on human 
faces, so does every great artist, whatever the 
material in which he works. Tito is man 
tempted and fallen ; Savonarola, like Romola, 
is man rising heroic from temptation and from 
the bewilderment of self-delusion. Indeed, 
Savonarola's right to appear in the book must 
be vindicated, if at all, by the part he plays in 
the central plot of the romance. Whether the 
real reformer of Florence was just such a man, 
whether the background is archaeologically 
accurate : these are alike minor details, hardly 
touching aesthetic criticism at all. 

The recent death of our most influential 
writer reminds us of the question once so 
fiercely debated, whether " Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
was a truthful picture of slavery days in Ken- 
tucky and Louisiana. If it could be proved 
that no black family was ever separated, no 
innocent negro ever flogged, since Jamestown 
was founded, the swarthy hero of a baseless 
romance would remain as deathless as Homer's 
impossible son of the sea-nymph, with his 
magic armor and his talking horse ! Both are 
truly drawn, since they act in response to the 
most universal human motives. No other test 
of artistic quality is essential. 

Yet we must once more reverse the shield of 
truth. While the artist's thought is thus free 
and eternal, the form in which he clothes it is 
largely shaped for him by usage and tradition, 
even before he himself is born. Phidias, the 
pupil of his Hellenic masters, working under 
the Attic sky, was not merely forced to use his 
native Pentelic marble, instead of New Hamp- 
shire granite or " staff ": it was equally im- 
possible or inconceivable for him, upon the 
Acropolis, to rear a Florentine dome or a 
Gothic spire. 

Even so, we who speak and write the En- 
glish tongue cannot escape the wise do not 
even struggle against the masterful influence 
of the myriad workers who through so many 
centuries have moulded and perfected Anglo- 
Saxon speech. We, and those who form our 
audience, have been from infancy the pupils of 
Chaucer (Professor Child would have bidden 
me say, of Ca3dmon) and of Tennyson, and of 
all the goodly array between. Whatever is 
traditional in all our arts, except perhaps music, 
is chiefly and primarily English in form, though 
it is largely Greek in spirit. Moreover, free as 
the writer is, he, especially, works in materials 
which have already been shaped for him : even, 
it may be, moulded over and over before him, 
by weak hands as well as strong. (A really 



fresh rhyme brings us nowadays almost a shock 
of surprise. In this matter our mother-tongue, 
with its excessive variety of endings, gives us 
rather step-motherly fare.) We sometimes seem 
to ourselves almost like those late Romans who 
shaped their structures wholly out of blocks, 
ready carved, taken from the earlier buildings. 
THE DIAL, especially, has long waged an 
effective warfare, of argument and ridicule, 
against the notion that American literature in 
general, and sectional Western literature in 
particular, should cut loose from the English 
traditions that make up the past, and grow 
from roots deep-struck in a virginal native soil. 
It is in fact only very incompletely, if at all, 
that literature in America can ever tear itself 
free from the parent stock in what Hawthorne 
was fond of calling " Our Old Home." It is 
precisely the vital English element in our lan- 
guage and literature, in our political and social 
instincts, in our entire civilization indeed, that 
has enabled us in any hopeful degree to assimi- 
late that chaotic mass of humanity which year 
by year has poured into the great gateway of 
Manhattan. The last thing a far-sighted patriot 
can desire is a weakening of any ties which 
still bind us to the happiest of our many father- 
lands, the island stronghold 

" Where Freedom broadens slowly down 
From precedent to precedent." 

May even the exigencies of politics never again 
require an outburst of half-sincere jealousy, 
or unreasoning rage, against our next of kin, 
" such as of late o'er pale Britannia past ! " 
But at any rate, the sincere student of letters 
must see clearly that we (I speak now for the 
"old New Englanders ") are twice-transplanted 
Anglo-Saxon folk, who, in the forms of our 
speech, as chiefly in the forms of our life, have 
been moulded by the long, slow centuries of 
English growth. 

And yet, so far as the instinct of the artist 
awakes in each man, the boundless universe is 
his. The environment in which he sets his 
gem, or his cathedral, may be as homely and 
familiar as Maud Muller's farm : it may be the 
vaguest spot in " desolate, windswept space." 
One thing only is essential : the presence, or the 
suggestion, of human beings, acting from mo- 
tives not wholly ignoble, as we ourselves might 
conceivably act, or wish that we had acted. 
Even Homer, or Sappho, or Sophocles, can 
teach us, directly, little more than what Sidney 
said, and Longfellow only echoed : 

" Look, then, into thy heart, and write ! "

IrfKUTKNANT PEABY IN NOBTHKBN 

GBKKNLAND.* 

In all. Lieutenant Peary has made five ex- 
cursions into the inhospitable regions near the 
eightieth parallel of north latitude. The first, 
in 1886, was only a reconnoisanoe. The second 
and third, in 1891-92 and 1893-95, were in 
a much larger sense preliminary, undertaken 
with the purpose of establishing a base of oper- 
ations whence it might be possible to launch 
an expedition to the northern pole. The fourth 
and fifth were simply summer trips made to 
secure certain notable meteoric masses discov- 
ered by him upon the Greenland coast. 

Previous to Lieutenant Peary's journeys, 
the insular character of Greenland had been 
guessed but not determined. It was known 
only as a triangular area more than seventeen 
hundred miles in length from north to south, 
and about six hundred miles wide at the eight- 
ieth parallel of latitude. Of this area, only 
about twenty-five miles in width of selvedge 
along the western and part of the eastern shore 
was known to explorers and whale fishers, bleak 
in the few summer days, ice-bound through the 
long arctic winter, and peopled with only a few 
nomadic Eskimos. Everywhere this selvedge 
is interrupted by bays, inlets, and fiords, each 
headed by a glacier and each glacier launching 
its annual quota of the fleet of icebergs that 
become the dread of Atlantic sailors. Peary 
reasoned that these icebergs were the outcrop- 
ping of a broad glacial field or ice-cap covering 
the whole peninsula, rising gradually toward 
a central divide, and presenting a surface either 
rigidly frozen or often freshly covered with 
snow, which would be easily travelled upon a 
proper equipment of snow-shoes or ski. He 
farther conceived that an exploring party 
should consist of not more than two or three 
persons, hardy, sturdy, and determined, clothed 
like the natives, supplied with the most con- 
centrated foods, their impedimenta moved on 
sledges by dogs, which should be counted as 
provision on the foot, to be consumed by their 
companions as the burden of freight diminished. 
Once upon this highway, traversed as freely as 
the open sea, the explorer could easily reach a 
latitude limited only by the unknown northern

coast of Greenland. From the point so reached, 
a small and determined band, with a like outfit, 
at a proper juncture might make a dash for 
the coveted acme of northern exploration. 

The reconnoisanoe of 1886 determined the 
possibility of using the ice-cap as a highway. 
The test was made by a journey eastward from 
Disco Bay. In about three weeks from start 
to return a trip was made to a point having an 
altitude of about 7500 feet and well within the 
central area of the ice-cap. 

The most important of Lieutenant Peary's 
journeys, thongh not that which consumed the 
most time, was that of 1891-2. With him 
went his wife and five assistants. McCormick 
Bay, near the northwestern angle of Greenland, 
was reached on July 23, after a voyage much 
delayed by ice. The season was already too 
much advanced to permit the undertaking of 
the great journey over the ice to the eastern 
angle of Greenland, which was the chief object 
of the expedition. Besides, a vicious tiller had 
worked loose in a storm and had broken the 
chief's leg. During the enforced delay of an 
arctic winter, much valuable work was done in 
ethnological study and collection, which, how- 
ever, was but a side issue compared with the 
real purpose of the campaign. On the 3d 
of May, after most careful preparation, the 
" Great White March " was begun. The outfit 
was soon reduced to fourteen dogs, the lading 
of two sledges, and one companion. The jour- 
ney extended nearly six hundred miles, to Navy 
Cliff at the head of Independence Bay, in lat- 
itude 81 37' 5" north, and longitude 34 5' 
west. On June 5 the travellers had reached the 
summit of the divide, altitude 5700 feet. On 
July 4 the terminus was reached. The season 
was midsummer ; flowers bloomed in abund- 
ance, birds and insects were plentiful, while 
musk-oxen were so many that the travellers 
readily secured all needful for themselves and 
for their dogs. After a brief rest on the 7th, 
the return began. Eight dogs only remained, 
and drew all the freight on a single sledge. In 
one month the journey was finished, the average 
marches being about twenty miles per diem. 
So much of the mission was accomplished as the 
determination of the northern limit of Green- 
land, and the discovery of a route which might 
lead as an imperial highway towards the pole. 
Peary's third expedition left Philadelphia 
June 23, 1895, and reached Inglefield Gulf on 
the 3d of August. As soon as the opening 
spring should permit, a party of eight was to 
move over the ice to the northeast coast. Three

of these were to attempt the journey to the pole ; 
three were to go southward to Cape Bismarck 
on the eastern coast and return thence overland 
to the western base ; while two were to main- 
tain a station to which the northern party might 
return or retreat as the occasion should prove. 
On March 6, 1894, the start was made. By 
April 10 so many mishaps had befallen, men 
disabled and dogs dead, that it was evident the 
march must be abandoned for the season. The 
larger part of the surplus of supplies was cached 
at a point about one hundred and thirty miles 
from the lodge by the sea, whither the party 
retreated. Other caches were made on the way. 
In October an expedition was made to recover 
these caches, repack them, and mark afresh 
their positions ; but they were not found. The 
storms and the drifted snows had obliterated 
every trace of them. 

The difficulties of marking and finding loca- 
tions upon the ice-cap proved to be insuperable. 
The surface of the elevated plateau was covered 
with an icy crust, carved and seamed by relent- 
less winds whose traces were quickly obliterated 
by the drifting of new-fallen snow. The air 
was full of snow. The vision was bounded by 
a canopy of cloud which allowed no glimpse of 
sun or star, and nautical observations could 
seldom be made. A point could be determined 
only by the dead reckoning of a compass and 
an odometer. 

The following winter was spent in gathering 
from the resources of the country supplies, 
chiefly of frozen walrus and deer meat, to re- 
place those which had been lost. On April 1, 
1895, with two men and forty dogs, the jour- 
ney across the ice-cap was again undertaken. 
The story of this march is a record of indomi- 
table courage and of patient endurance never 
surpassed, but expended upon judgment which 
can hardly be approved, and effective of no 
adequate result. The reasons for a return in 
1894 were yet more potent in 1895. The stock 
of supplies was far less fit than on the preceding 
year. Independence Bay might be revisited, 
but it was evident that the northward trip could 
not follow, nor could the foundation be then 
laid for such a trip in the future. The result 
was less disastrous than could reasonably have 
been expected. The men survived the march 
of 1200 miles over the " Great Ice." They 
found the cliff which overlooked the bay, but 
dared not risk the descent. They retraced their 
steps, and when they regained the lodge by the 
western sea they had barely escaped eating their 
sole remaining dog, through whose attenuated 



carcass all the other forty had made a vicarious 
passage. The narrative of this journey, simply 
and modestly told, excites sympathy and ad- 
miration, but it recalls the remark of the French 
marshall who witnessed the famous charge of 
the six hundred. " C'est magnifique, mais ce 
n'est pas la guerre." 

It is not our purpose to analyse, much less to 
criticise, the plans for polar search by way of 
Whale Sound and Independence Bay. Others 
more competent to judge have given them their 
approval. Lieutenant Peary has already en- 
tered upon a renewed attempt at this solution 
of the polar problem. His countrymen unite 
in the hope that his undoubted nerve, pluck, 
and perseverance may be so guided and so for- 
tunate as to win for him a successful issue.

THE MONROE DOCTRINE FROM AN 
ENGLISH STANDPOINT.* 

So much has lately been said about the 
Monroe Doctrine that a new book upon the 
subject is likely to attract attention. Mr. Red- 
daway's contribution to the discussion is a short 
essay of a hundred and fifty pages, which was 
originally prepared in competition for a Cam- 
bridge University prize. The author says in 
his preface that he has laid under contribution 
a mass of unpublished documents in the Public 
Record Office, but he does not seem to have 
discovered much that is not already to be found 
in easily accessible printed sources. The book 
is interesting, however, as a discussion of the 
Monroe Doctrine from the English point of 
view. 

The larger part of the essay is devoted to an 
account of the origin of the Doctrine. The 
statement of the European side of the situation 
is well done, but the account of the American 
side betrays the fact that the author's acquaint- 
ance witn the history of the United States is 
by no means intimate. It is surprising to be 
told that, " It is the proudest trophy of the 
American government that the pen of Jefferson 
could formulate against France broad princi- 
ples of neutrality to which time has added 
nothing," when it is well known that Jefferson 
not only did not write the proclamation of neu- 
trality, but denounced its phraseology as " pu- 
sillanimous." The sentence quoted illustrates 
a tendency toward rhetorical flourish and an

indirectness of statement that characterize the 



With respect to the authorship of the Decla- 
ration, Mr. Reddaway concludes that " the 
conception of the Monroe Doctrine and much 
of its phraseology came from Adams, and the 
share of Monroe did not extend beyond revi- 
sion." " The part played by Jefferson," he 
says, " seems to be defined in the fact that his 
advice was sought and not followed." It has 
always been well known that John Qnincy 
Adams largely inspired Monroe's Declaration, 
but Mr. Reddaway overstates the case in his 
favor. The Declaration consisted of three 
propositions, each of which had a different 
origin. The first proposition opposed further 
European colonization of the American conti- 
nents. This part was wholly due to Adams, 
and was but a re-statement of his declaration to 
Baron Tuyl and his instructions to Rush. The 
second proposition opposed American interfer- 
ence in European affairs. Innumerable pre- 
cedents for this part of the Declaration might 
be cited, of which the most notable are Wash- 
ington's Farewell Address and Jefferson's First 
Inaugural. The idea was clearly expressed in 
Paine's " Common Sense " the first published 
argument for the independence of the colonies. 
As this earliest precedent seems to have been 
overlooked by writers upon this subject, it is 
worth quoting in full. Paine wrote : 

"Submission to or dependence on Great Britain tends 
directly to involve this Continent in European wars and 
quarrels, and [to] set us at variance with nations who 
would otherwise seek our friendship, and against whom 
we have neither anger nor complaint. As Europe is our 
market for trade, we ought to form no partial connec- 
tion with any part of it. It is the true interest of 
America to steer clear of European contentions, which 
she never can do while, by her dependence on Britain, 
he is made the make- weight in the scale of British 
politics." 

This proposition was a part of the stock of 
political ideas common to the American people 
from the time of the Revolution. If the honor 
of first formulating it is to be assigned to any- 
one, it would seem to belong to Paine. The 
third proposition of the Declaration opposed 
European interference in American affairs. 
Simple as is this corollary of the second propo- 
sition, it had never before been publicly and 
officially stated. It is the important advance 
that Monroe made upon previous statements. 
The " conception " seems to be more distinctly 
traceable to Jefferson than to any other states- 
man. The purchase of Louisiana was a most 
important step toward diminishing European 



influence in America. In 1808 Jefferson wrote, 
in reference to Cuba and Mexico : 

" We consider their interests and ours as the same, 
and the object of both must be to exclude all European 
influence in this hemisphere." 

In his celebrated letter to Monroe in reference 
to the proposed Declaration, Jefferson wrote : 
Our first and fundamental maxim should be never to 
entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe; our second, 
never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis- Atlantic 
affairs. America, North and South, has a set of interests 
distinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly her own. 
She should, therefore, have a system of her own, sepa- 
rate and apart from that of Europe. While the last is 
laboring to become the domicile of despotism, our en- 
deavor should surely be to make our hemisphere that of 
freedom." 

Here we have the exact ideas and almost the 
phraseology of Monroe's message. It is true 
that Jefferson favored a joint declaration, and 
that a separate declaration was finally decided 
upon ; but that does not alter the fact that the 
most important part of the message originated 
in his suggestion. The Monroe Doctrine is thus 
seen to have been a composite production, to 
which Adams and Jefferson contributed in 
nearly equal proportions. 

The remainder of Mr. Reddaway's little book 
discusses the reception of the Doctrine, its rela- 
tion to International Law, and its later appli- 
cations. He finds that the Declaration pro- 
duced slight effect in South American states, 
and that they looked chiefly to Great Britain 
for support. He points out that the policy of 
a single power does not modify the Law of 
Nations, and that the influence of the Monroe 
Doctrine is evil so far as it leads the people of 
the United States to believe that they possess 
in their international relations greater rights 
than they are entitled to under the rules of 
International Law. The author's concluding 
analysis of the foundation of the Monroe Doc- 
trine may be briefly summarized. In his view, 
the Doctrine is based upon the assumption that 
the distance between European and American 
states creates a natural line of demarkation 
between them. This assumption, he claims, is 
unfounded. Land, rather than water, separates 
nations. Intercourse, rather than geographical 
position, unites them. With existing means of 
transit, South America is as closely connected 
with Europe as with the United States. The 
assumption failing, upon which the Doctrine is 
based, the Doctrine must fall with it. 

Mr. Reddaway's book cannot, of course, 
include the latest phase in the history of the 
Monroe Doctrine. Just as Europe seems to

yield a tacit assent to the assumptions advanced 
in its name, a considerable portion of the Amer- 
ican people propose in effect to discard the 
Doctrine as too confining for the purposes of 
our future development. The actual occupation 
of the whole of the American continents long 
ago rendered obsolete that part of the Declara- 
tion relating to colonization. There remain 
the propositions respecting intervention : non- 
intervention by the United States in European 
affairs, and non - intervention by European 
states in American affairs. It should not be 
forgotten that these propositions are reciprocal. 
If we abandon one, we cannot claim the other. 
It is worthy of serious consideration whether 
the practical recognition of our supremacy in 
America does not outweigh any advantages 
that are likely to accrue from the acquisition 
of territory in other hemispheres, and whether, 
after all, it is not better to avoid both the mazes 
of European diplomacy and the burdens of the 
European system of standing armies and costly

"THE DRAMA AS LITERATURE." * 

Many people nowadays, especially in this 
country, if they want the choicest fine blossom 
of the contemporary drama, have to get it by 
reading. Either because of absence from me- 
tropoles, or because of the absence of apprecia- 
tive managers, they find it next to impossible 
to see " Heimat," for instance, or " The Doll's 
House," or " Die versunkene Glocke," and 
more than impossible to see "La Princesse 
Maleine " or " Salome." They may be able in 
the future, perhaps, to see " La Ville Morte " 
or " Cyrano de Bergerac," but still, practically, 
they have to content themselves with reading : 
inferior plays they can see on the stage, but 
the plays which have interested the world they 
must read. 

Now, ever since the dictum of a well-known 
critic last January, reading plays has been like 
eating ashes. Previously there had been an 
idea that some plays were even better " as lit- 
erature " than on the stage. But the ruling 
just mentioned did away with such a fancy. It 
laid down the principle that a dramatist " must 
please his immediate audience "; it held up the 
ideal of an " imaginative sympathy needful to 
enable [readers or critics] to see a play as it 
might appear on the stage " ; it gathered itself

Shaw. Chicago : Herbert S. Stone & Co. 



together in the remark that " there is no more 
patent absurdity than the play that is not 
intended to be acted." The critic in question 
meant that reading plays was merely a very 
unsatisfactory substitute for seeing them ; that 
it had no independent existence. He did not 
mention the fact that it is impossible for us to 
see any of the plays of Shakespeare, Moliere, 
Aristophanes, etc., as their authors imagined 
them, and impossible also to recreate in the 
imagination any of these masterpieces of the 
drama as they were seen by the audience for 
which they were written ; namely, that it was 
impossible to enjoy them in anything but a sur- 
reptitious and fanciful way. It was of no conse- 
quence to him that he deprived of enjoyment 
many of his fellow-creatures ; indeed, he prob- 
ably did not think of this matter, for his mind 
was quite absorbed in his great conception that 
there was no such thing as a " literary play." 

The gloom thus diffused throughout the 
reading public, however, was somewhat light- 
ened by the announcement that the plays of 
Mr. Bernard Shaw were to be published. 
Bernard Shaw was a name to arouse the imag- 
ination, for everybody felt quite sure that he 
must be somebody, and nobody (in America) 
knew just who he was. It was obvious also 
that his plays must be literary plays, because 
no one could remember having seen them or 
having heard of them on the stage. Here was a 
bit of comfort for those who held that, entirely 
aside from stage representation, there was intel- 
ligent pleasure to be gained from reading plays. 

The position would seem to be this : Here 
are so-called plays. They have not been great 
stage successes. They do not please immediate 
audiences. Yet shall they not be read, per- 
haps, with intelligent pleasure ? Here is a book ; 
and a book of which the content distinguishes 
it readily from directories, catalogues, vol- 
umes of this or that " series," railway novels, 
logarithmic tables, accumulations of by-gone 
journalism, cook-books, and so forth, to which 
we instinctively deny the name of literature : 
these plays are read with aroused intelligence, 
they must give impressions or opinions, and 
these impressions or opinions must be of inter- 
est to the critic. What shall he say about them ? 

Of course these plays are not ostentatious 
" closet-plays "; they are not remarkable in 
form or technique. Some plays, as we read 
them, do not seem at all adapted for the stage. 
" Hanneles Himmelfahrt " was successful, cu- 
riously enough, but we do not readily imagine 
anyone acting " Pelleas et Melisande." The

plays of Mr. Bernard Shaw, however, are cast 
44 in the ordinary practical comedy form in use 
at all the theatres "; they are meant to be acted 
when anyone comes along that can act them. 
Still, the author publishes them that they may 
also be read. 

His reasons for thinking it well to read plays 
are not precisely those just indicated. Mr. 
Bernard Shaw says that Englishmen do not 
customarily go to the theatre. Even if they 
did, they might not like " literary plays ": in 
Spain people go to the theatre every night, but 
they do not wish to see " literary plays " for all 
that ; they have invented another kind of en- 
tertainment which they like much better. Mr. 
Bernard Shaw also thinks " that a perfectly 
adequate and successful stage representation of 
a play requires a combination of circumstances 
so extraordinarily fortunate that [he] doubts 
whether it ever occurred in the history of the 
world." This I take leave to think is almost 
hypercritical. A writer of plays probably con- 
ceives his unwritten play in terms of the stage- 
circumstance to which he is accustomed ; and 
if the play appears in that circumstance, it 
is probably adequately presented," as ade- 
quately, at least, as it can ever exist in the 
mind of a reader. 

It is not for these reasons that I approve of 
printed plays. I approve of them because I 
can see that there may be such a thing as a lit- 
erary form called " the drama " which will en- 
able a man to do what he cannot do in any other 
way. This literary form is conditioned partly 
by the simpler current exigencies of the stage 
as they are understood by most readers this 
is the conventional part, and partly by the 
necessity of appealing to one reader alone, 
instead of to a number of hearers together. The 
acted play is governed by neither of these neces- 
sities. The acted play must conform to a great 
number of mechanical and theatrical neces- 
sities, which the average reader knows nothing 
at all about, and it appeals to the eyes and the 
minds of a number of persons gathered together, 
which is a very different thing from one person 
alone. Perhaps the greatest plays are those 
which succeed under all these conditions ; but 
certainly some plays will answer one set of re- 
quirements and other plays will answer the 
other. Now suppose you have a play which an- 
swers the first set, but not the second ; what will 
you do ? Call it an absurdity, with Mr. Brander 
Matthews? I imagine myself doing so, and 
feel that I am absurd myself ; so I try to regard 
it otherwise. 



After this it may seem unwise to allow that 
the chief characteristics of Mr. Bernard Shaw's 
plays are not precisely dramatic. They might 
appear in other work of their author as well as 
here. A great dramatist has leading charac- 
teristics which are especially dramatic, which 
demand the stage. I do not see that Mr. 
Bernard Shaw has. Sudermann, Ibsen, Mae- 
terlinck, to take both practical playwrights 
and airy theorists, are each noteworthy for 
things that would not appear if they wrote 
novels. In the case of Sudermann, who has 
written novels, the chief characteristic of his 
dramatic work which I take to be the com- 
bining of a number of motives in one focus 
is not at all obvious in them. But the striking 
thing about Mr. Bernard Shaw might be made 
to appear in a novel, and, I think, quite as well 
as it is made to appear in the plays. 

It does not follow from this that these 
plays are especially undramatic, even from the 
point of view of the stage. In fact, they were 
all written for the stage. One does not wonder 
that " Arms and the Man " received some 
applause ; it is more remarkable that " You 
Never Can Tell " was not put on the stage. 
" Mrs. Warren's Profession " was barred for 
non-dramatic reasons. I have said that the 
main characteristic of these plays the par- 
ticular mood of realism was not dramatic. 
I am inclined to think, however, that the special 
mode of its manifestation does belong to the 
stage. Mr. Bernard Shaw is a realist, but he 
does not mean to be dull for all that, not over- 
serious, plodding, stupid, dry-as-dust, dodder- 
ing. He attains his end by a curious expedient 
which I think must belong particularly to the 
stage, I do not easily conceive of it elsewhere, 
namely, by what, at first, appears to be almost 
conventional farce. This general form of irony 
is not impossible in other kinds of literature, 
although it is rather uncommon ; but it cannot 
be realized in the way followed here, except on 
the stage. 

These plays of Mr. Bernard Shaw might 
make, and probably have made, a good deal of 
talk from a point of view which does not dis- 
tinguish between a play and, let us say, a trea- 
tise. 4t Mrs. Warren's Profession " is written 
on a matter which is not usually regarded 
and rightly enough as mentionable in ordi- 
nary society. 4t Widowers' Houses " deals with 
another problem," and this time a perfectly 
proper one. " The Philanderer " is apparently 
conceived as being on still another question ; 
but here Mr. Bernard Shaw carries his farce so 



1898.]

far that it is impossible to regard the matter 
seriously. These are the " unpleasant plays " 
so called ; less pleasant than the others chiefly 
because they exhibit the following out of rather 
a poor idea. The " problem play " seems to be 
rather a modern English habit ; Mr. Pinero 
and Mr. Jones lean to it. But it is not in its 
nature anything especially dramatic : in fact, 
reasoning from Aristotle's central idea, it seems 
to me undramatic. 

Anyway, it is not here a matter of especial 
interest, for it is not a characteristic of the best 
of these plays. It is lacking in " Candida," 
" Arms and the Man," and " You Never Can 
Tell "; these have no problems, they are not 
tracts or criticisms or police reports in disguise. 
They are simply plays. " Pleasant Plays " they 
are called by Mr. Bernard Shaw, and to my 
mind the reason for their being pleasant is 
because they are much better as plays than the 
unpleasant ones. Of the three, " Candida " 
has most depth. The two others are very 
amusing and have much good meat to them. 
But " Candida " has more earnest searching- 
ness, or searching earnestness, on some rather 
deep points. I have seen it called " as true a 
poem as was ever written in prose." This seems 
a complimentary remark, but neither well- 
founded nor at all descriptive. I should say 
that it is a play which pleases at the time and 
pleases in remembrance. I almost regret that 
the poet in the play was not lame, or something 
of the sort (as Mr. Bernard Shaw suggests), 
so that it might have been acted. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



THE PROBLEM OF THE ARYANS.* 

The learned author of " The Evolution of 
the Aryan," Rudolph von Ihering, never fully 
completed the work. Three books out of the 
seven which were to comprise it were never 
written, and the fourth book is probably far 
from complete. It is well, however, that what 
was written has been printed. The books in 
which the life and history of the primitive 
Aryan have been reconstructed deal chiefly or 
exclusively with evidence from language. This 
work is a study of survival in custom. The 
translator, in his preface, says : 

" Von Ihering was a wonderfully versatile man. A 
Professor of Roman Law one of the greatest author- 
ities on the subject that ever lived, he devoted much 

* THE EVOLUTION OF THE ARYAN. By Rudolph von Ihering. 
Translated by A. Drucker. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



of his spare time to the study of ancient history, prin- 
cipally of those customs pertaining to law which seemed 
to him incongruous with the state of civilization which 
the Romans of that period had reached: and this work 
is the outcome of his researches." 

Our author's conclusions are not always in 
harmony with some of the favorite views of the 
present time. He believes the first home of the 
Aryans was in Asia in ancient Bactria. He 
claims that migration took place from there 
into Europe and into India. This ancient 
Asiatic people is his parent-nation or mother- 
nation. He considers the migration to have 
been of long duration, and locates a second 
home of the Aryans in the great plain of South- 
ern Europe. This second home appears to have 
been a resting-place for the migrating masses. 
From it, later migrations populated almost the 
whole of Europe with Aryan folk, and the dif- 
ferentiation of the five great nations Greeks, 
Latins, Celts, Teutons, Slavs took place 
locally. To the migrating peoples, particularly 
while in their second home, the author appears 
to confine the name Indo-European. 

These are fundamental ideas from which and 
to which von Ihering works. His argument is 
interesting and ingenious. Almost ignoring lin- 
guistic evidence, he studies survival and cus- 
tom. In the four books he investigates the 
Aryan Parent Nation, Aryans and Semites, 
Emigration of the Aryans, The Wandering. 
The fifth, sixth, and seventh books were to have 
dealt with the Second Home, Origin of the 
European Nations, Difference of the European 
Nations. Von Ihering considers the Aryans in 
their original home to have lacked energy and 
practicality ; the modern Hindu, dreamy and 
unpractical, more adequately represents them 
than do the modern peoples of Europe. By his 
method the author claims to prove that the first 
home was inland, and probably isolated by lines 
of enclosing mountains. Although a settled and 
populous folk, the parent nation was pastoral 
and non-agricultural ; it was ignorant of metals, 
and built neither towns nor houses of stones ; 
law, whether international or domestic, crim- 
inal or property, was at a low stage of devel- 
opment. 

The power which converted the Aryan 
dreamer of inland Asia into a nation, from 
which should come the eminently practical 
Roman, is claimed to have been contact with 
Semitic civilization. The contrast drawn be- 
tween Aryan and Semitic cultures, and the pic- 
ture of old Babylonian culture, are masterpieces 
of work. To the Babylonian, von Ihering

attributes the town, the fortress, the stone (or 
brick) house, the trade of building, measure- 
ment of time and dimension, brick-burning, use 
of water, navigation and commerce ; and these 
were transmitted to the Aryans. The fact of 
the migration, its character, the customs devel- 
oped in it and by it, are investigated, and many 
curious and at first sight inexplicable customs 
are traced in their beginnings back to that time. 
In the ver sacrum, for example, von Ihering 
sees the ceremonial repetition of the once forced 
swarming forth of the young to seek a new 
home. Most interesting of all, perhaps, is the 
tracing back to reasonable and useful origins 
of the curious practices connected with the 
Roman fetiales, pontijices, and auspices. 

The style of the work is charming ; the argu- 
ment forceful. The analysis is clear, and the ar- 
gument is summed up in a series of propositions, 
each growing out of the preceding. Whether 
the author's conclusions are always sound, or 
his fundamental ideas are accepted, the mate- 
rial and the mode of presenting it are so new 
and important that the book must have a not- 
able influence in the discussion of Aryan ori- 
gins and development. FREDERICK STARR. 



THE REACTION OF 

ON FAITH.* 

If the first effect of a growth in knowledge was 
unbelief, its far more extended and permanent re- 
sult has been a reopening and a reconsideration in 
many ways of the terms of faith. The group of 
books before us, and the multitude of works with 
which they are associated, are illustrations of the 
eagerness with which men shortly bring any new 
resources of knowledge to the ever-enduring and 
inescapable inquiries of our spiritual life. 

The first book on our list, " The New Puritanism," 
illustrates this reaction in one of the many phases 
which it presents. The New Puritanism is the re- 
ligions cast which a wider sympathy with men has 
given to our Christian life. Henry Ward Beecher, 
if not a critical student of Sociology, had a pene-

trative grasp of its immediate facts, and a very 
living interest in them. It was this spiritual insight 
which imparted to him a prophetic force, and 
impelled him to give a more loving and tender ren- 
dering of Christian life. Christ was to him the 
great heart of God, the great heart of humanity ; 
and so arose the New Puritanism. Those who 
united in the recent celebration of the fiftieth anni- 
versary of Plymouth Church are men of a kindred 
temper, and the occasion was chiefly improved in 
the enforcement of this more universal life. The 
book has interest for all who are in sympathy with 
a more immediate and renovative effort among men, 
in their personal and social relations. 

Selfhood and Service " is also a bringing of 
social truth to Christian experience. Its main con- 
tention is the personal and social discipline which 
attends upon the acquisition of wealth. The thought 
so far is plain, adequate, and stimulating. We can 
hardly feel that the author, in treating this theme, 
was at liberty to overlook, to the degree he has, 
two essentials in making production personally and 
socially beneficent. Thorough integrity, a keen recog- 
nition of the rights of men, and generous sympathy 
making one's efforts directly aidful to all asso- 
ciated with him must be present, or the getting 
and dispensing of wealth will both lose their spiritual 
value. The three stand in this order of importance : 
integrity, aidfulness, beneficence. Beneficence, 
divorced from the other two, is mere tinsel. The 
fine beneficence of a modern Cioesns is not suffi- 
cient to gild the enormous mass of injury inflicted 
on society by his business methods and spirit. 

" Divine Immanence " approaches the central 
spiritual problem, the conception of the nature of 
God, from the side of philosophy and science. What 
conception brings most light, and is most in har- 
mony with our present forms of knowledge? The 
book is unusually clear, definite, and progressive in 
its line of thought. The subject, though abstruse, 
is followed with ease and pleasure in its presentation. 
The author keeps firmly to the ground except when 
he approaches his last dogmatic conclusion. He 
then leaps somewhat into the air. 

"The Mystery of Life " is another bringing to- 
gether of the terms of science and faith. It is a 
work not without ability, yet it yields comparatively 
little stimulus or instruction. The two elements of 
science and revelation are not thoroughly fused in 
each other. The book is the presentation and vin- 
dication of a somewhat involved and arbitrary 
dogma that of a distinct spirit superinduced upon 
mind, life, and body. The spiritual being is a fourth 
entity, on whose presence or absence man's higher 
and immortal hopes are made to rest. The recon- 
ciliation, therefore, of the physical and the spiritual 
is the absence of any contradiction between them, 
not their union in one supreme product. Revelation 
remains revelation under a narrow dogmatic form. 
" Life, Death, and Immortality " receives its title 
from the first of a series of essays not very closely 
united, and which have been in part previously pub- 



1898.]

lished. Among these essays are : " Oriental Relig- 
ions," " Christianity and Mohammedanism," " The 
Natural History of Church Organization," " The 
Heresy of Non-Progressive Orthodoxy," " Miracles." 
The author has a highly speculative mind, and this 
fact will render some of the essays less interesting 
to the mass of readers. His thought is coherent and 
his style perspicuous. One feels that he is brought 
in contact with an unusually vigorous personality. 
The appeal is constantly and exclusively to reason. 
Yet a strong religious faith pervades the discussions. 
We especially commend the essay entitled " Bud- 
dhism and Christianity." 

The chief interest of " Clerical Life " is literary. 
It is made up of letters, twenty in number, addressed 
chiefly to some minister whose faults or circum- 
stances are to come under criticism. Though these 
letters are, on the title page, referred to eight differ- 
ent authors, they are each anonymous, and are quite 
uniform in method and in style. Eight of them, 
signed X., are presumably written by Dr. Watson. 
They are somewhat of the Addisonian order : indi- 
rect, mild, and satirical, in their praise and censure. 
The occasion chosen is not ordinarily a serious one, 
and it is gracefully presented under a variety of 
side lights. The book is enjoyable and not unin- 
structive. The title, however, is more serious than 
the treatment. There is an occasional defect in 
taste in allowing the subject of stricture to become 
too idiotic in his faults as in the case of the min- 
ister who had been to Germany. The critic seems 
to find himself unable to set on the dogs of criticism 
till he has clothed his victim in bear-skins.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The re( * cover of " The International 
Scientific Series" (Appleton) has 

come to be & tra a e . mar ]j O f scientific 

respectability. As in all series, the works differ 
widely in scholarship and value; but a laudable 
standard of average excellence has been maintained. 
It is particularly unfortunate that a topic which has 
been so constantly beset with the dogmatism of 
system-makers should find such an unsatisfactory 
representation in this series. Volume LXXVIII. 
(" Memory and its Cultivation," by F. W. Edridge 
Green) is as completely out of place in a scientific 
series as it is innocent of the sound psychological 
principles upon which alone a modern book on mem- 
ory can be wisely written. Instead of the compre- 
hensive physiological and psychological basis for the 
proper presentation of the processes of memory 
which modern research makes possible, we have a 
totally arbitrary system of rejuvenated phrenolog- 
ical faculties in which Time and Eventuality, Size 
and Incongruity, Causality and Cautiousness, Imi- 
tation and Benevolence, all hold coordinate and 
chaotic sway. Eight most illogical and unnecessary 



reasons are given why it is not possible to determine 
the position of a faculty from the conformations of 
the skull, and a medley of thirteen even more un- 
fortunate arguments is offered to prove that the 
faculties of the mind are multiple. Is this nineteenth- 
century science? With such a theoretical basis, 
the nature of memory is unfolded and a system of 
practical rules for the cultivation of memory is de- 
veloped. The expositions and explanations are quite 
largely of the type of a by-gone age when the power 
of opium to put one to sleep was acceptably ex- 
plained by reason of its soporific faculty. A man 
who has a " large faculty for colour " is one who 
remembers colors easily, and one who remembers 
colors easily may be said to have a "large fac- 
ulty for colour." The precepts founded upon this 
type of analysis are of that aggravatingly vague 
and didactic form which tell us to seek a certain 
end, which is exactly what we clearly know, and 
fail to tell us how to go about it, which is the 
helpless ignorance we had hoped to relieve. No 
book written by an intelligent writer is continuously 
bad ; and there are scattered here and there through- 
out the three hundred pages some suggestive facts 
and illustrations. But it is hopeless to suppose that 
any seeker after a good memory, who is urged on 
by the glittering prospect of the preface that the 
discovery of the facts of memory enabled the author 
to learn a subject in a fifth of the time that it for- 
merly occupied, will be able to steer his tortuous 
way through this poorly illuminated tangle, with 
either profit or pleasure. A student who attended 
the memory classes of a famous " memory profes- 
sor," when asked how he profited by the instruction, 
replied that he thought he would have progressed 
very satisfactorily, were it not that he constantly 
forgot to go to the lessons. The best advice to offer 
the student of memory is to ask him to remember, 
not to attempt the study of memory by the aid of 
this unfortunate volume. 

Matthew Arnold If a recent publication entitled 
and the spirit " Matthew Arnold and the Spirit of 
of the age. the Age ( p utnam ) ha a f a n en into 

the hands of Mr. Howells previous to his recent 
discourse upon American literary centres, he might 
have added Sewanee, Tennessee, to his list. To 
the reading public, Sewanee is known as the seat of 
the University of the South, the home of at least 
three distinguished men of letters Professor Trent, 
Professor Wells, and the Rev. Greenough White 
and the place of publication of that admirable and 
dignified quarterly, " The Sewanee Review." It 
transpires from the volume above mentioned that 
Sewanee also boasts an English Club of gentlemen 
and ladies, which has had a somewhat chequered 
existence since 1885, and has devoted itself to the 
study of English language, literature, and thought. 
The subject chosen for last year's study was " the 
spirit of the age " as typified by Matthew Arnold ; 
and it was voted, at the end of the season, to pub- 
lish the papers that had been written about this

theme. The result ia a handsome volume, edited by 
Mr. Greenough White, and containing fourteen brief 
essays which consider, besides Arnold's own work, 
such writers as Clougb, Mr. Meredith, Mr. Watson, 
Mr. Austin, and Mrs. Ward, and such cognate 
topics aa " The Late Coarse of Religious Thought," 
" Recent History Writing," and " Lord Leighton 
and the Late Coarse of English Art." The value 
of work of this sort is, of coarse, chiefly subjective 
and social, bat the book of the Club makes an attract- 
ive showing, and sets an excellent example to other 
similar organizations. The papers contributed by 
the editor, and by his clerical colleague, Mr. W. P. 
DuBose, are those of the most value, although all 
are thoughtful and well-expressed. A certain nar- 
rowness of standpoint, an occasional unpleasant 
assumption of superior airs, and a trifle too much of 
editing, are the main defects of the discussion. We 
must find room for one delicioas bit of unconscious 
humor in the statement that " it is apparent that a 
work on the plan of Dr. Moulton's ' Modern Read- 
er's Bible ' would have delighted " Arnold. Dr. 
Moulton has numerous gifts, but he has not the gift 
of style for himself or of the sense for style in lit- 
erature, and his scientific arrangement of the scrip- 
tures is precisely the sort of thing that would have 
filled Arnold's soul with grief and inspired his 
most pungent satire. His " Isaiah " showed how 
the thing ought to be done, and his way was not 
Dr. Moulton's way, to put it mildly. 

Thackeray's request that he should 
not be made the subject of a formal 
biography is well-known, and has 
hitherto kept the material remaining in the possess- 
ion of his family from being used in a life of the 
great novelist Such sketches of his career as have 
been produced have been drawn from unofficial 
sources, and have proved meagre and unsatisfactory. 
But during the thirty-five years that have elapsed 
since his death, a considerable amount of his corre- 
spondence has been made public, and the outline, at 
least, of his life-history has gradually shaped itself 
in the minds of interested students of his work. So 
many misconceptions have arisen, both concerning 
his private life and his artistic endeavor, that it be- 
comes a delicate question of ethics to determine 
whether his family have acted wisely in their literal 
compliance with his expressed wish. At all events, 
Mrs. Ritchie, the daughter from whose pen the 
biography, if ever decided upon, should properly 
come, has so far relaxed her original resolution as 
to take part in the production of a " biographical 
edition " of his writings that will serve, to a consid- 
erable extent, as a substitute for the more formal 
" life " for which many students have not ceased to 
hope. In any case, this new publication presents 
the work of Thackeray to his readers in a highly 
acceptable form, and seems likely to supersede all 
its predecessors in popular favor and become the 
standard library edition of his novels. There are 
to be thirteen stout volumes in all, published monthly 






(Harper), and with each volume there will be incor- 
porated, in the form of an introduction, such pas- 
sages from his letters, journals, and sketch-books 
as relate to the history of the novel in question, and 
to the private life of the novelist at the time con- 
cerned. Three of the volumes have thus far been 
issued ; and as each of them contains about forty 
pages of this introductory matter, much of which 
has never before been published, a simple calculation 
will show that we may expect from them all a 
biography, however fragmentary and incoherent, 
amounting in the aggregate to some five hundred 
pages. That this will prove a boon to the student 
of literary history is quite evident, and the name of 
Mrs. Ritchie guarantees performance of the delicate 
task in a manner that will be at once tactful and 

trustworthy. 

Mr. Philip H. Goepp's " Symphonies 
and their Meaning " (Lippincott) is 
the sort of book that we approach 
with a dark foreboding. So much nonsense has 
been written about the " meaning " of absolute 
music, and so many writers have sought to give an 
objective significance to their own purely subjective 
impressions of the sonata and the symphony, that 
suspicion of such a title as the above is not unrea- 
sonable. Happily, Mr. Goepp does not justify the 
suspicion, and his discussion is reasonably free from 
the vagaries of interpretation that make so much 
of the critical literature of music absolutely worth- 
less. He does not escape the rhapsodical manner 
altogether, but it is fairly evident that his language 
is figurative, and that he understands it to be so. 
Still, this sort of thing, which occurs now and then, 
is at least ominous : " Suddenly a turn of the major 
lets in a clear ray of hope, and then comes the 
heroic lift from the abode of devils to that of angels, 
from hell to heaven from sinister, overwhelming 
evil to moral triumph." For the most part, how- 
ever, Mr. Goepp's book is a technical but not too 
technical analysis of about a dozen of the greatest 
of the symphonies, written with both knowledge 
and understanding, and provided with copious illus- 
trations in musical notation. It is a good book for 
the serious concert-goer who, although not a musi- 
cian himself, has reached the point of realizing that 
music is one of the most important means of culture, 
and cannot be omitted from any well-considered 
scheme of liberal education. 

" The Library of Literary History," 
a publishing enterprise undertaken 
by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin and repre- 
sented in this country by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons, pens its prospectus in the following words : 
" There is for every nation a history, which dues not 
respond to the trumpet-call of battle, which does not 
limit its interest to the conflict of dynasties. This 
the history of intellectual growth and artistic 
achievement if less romantic than the popular 
panorama of kings and queens, finds its material in 
imperishable masterpieces, and reveals to the student

something at once more vital and more picturesque 
than the quarrels of rival parliaments. Nor is it in 
any sense unscientific to shift the point of view from 
politics to literature. It is but the fashion of his- 
tory which insists that a nation lives only for her 
warriors, a fashion which might long since have been 
ousted by the commonplace reflection that, in spite 
of history, the poets are the true masters of the 
earth." As well, perhaps, as general terms can de- 
scribe such a series of volumes as is here projected, 
the passage quoted will suffice ; and we may point to 
M. Jusserand's " Literary History of the English 
People " as an already existent concrete embodiment 
of the idea. The first volume of the new series, " A 
Literary History of India," by Mr. R. W. Frazer, 
speaks well for the enterprise, and presents the views 
of a scholar long and favorably identified with his 
subject, who commands at the same time a singu- 
larly graceful and attractive style. Mr. Frazer 
begins with the Aryans, and carries us from the 
twilight period of Indian history, through the secular 
struggle between Brahmanism and Buddhism, down 
to modern times and what literature these times 
have produced. The epics and the drama are made 
the subject of special studies, and the work is, as a 
whole, the most readable and interesting treatment 
of its entire theme with which we are acquainted. 
It makes a handsome volume of nearly five hundred 
pages, and sets for its successors a standard of ex- 
cellence that will not easily be surpassed. We note 
that Professor Barrett Wendell has been commis- 
sioned to prepare " A Literary History of the United 
States " for the series. 



Dr. Garners 



Dr. Richard Garnett's " History of 
ite!ature. Italian Literature" (Appleton) is the 

fourth volume to appear in the series 
of " Literatures of the World," and is the best of 
the four, which amounts to very high praise when 
we consider the admirable treatment given to French 
and English literature by Professor Dowden and Mr. 
Gosse. It also emphasizes, even more than its prede- 
cessors, the intention of the series as a whole, which is 
obviously not to furnish an elementary compendium 
of knowledge, but rather to discuss literature from the 
standpoint of modern criticism, and for the benefit 
of an audience already in possession of the bare facts. 
One must know a certain amount beforehand about 
the history of Italian literature to get much profit 
from such a study as Dr. Garnett has written, and 
we are sometimes inclined to think that he takes too 
much previous information for granted to permit an 
appeal to other than a narrow audience. On the other 
hand, given the intention of addressing a cultivated 
circle of readers, there is not sufficient cause for 
refraining so carefully from the smallest scrap of 
original quotation, particularly as the author does 
not hesitate to introduce Latin quotations whenever 
it pleases him. In quoting Jowett with seeming 
approval, to the effect that Italian literature is " the 
greatest in the world after Greek, Latin, English," 
we think that enthusiasm for his subject has carried

Republic. 



the author too far. Even if the names of the great 
Italians are " weighed rather than counted," as he 
suggests, French literature still remains a more im- 
portant product, and is the second of modern litera- 
tures as unquestionably as English is the first. The 
style of Dr. Garnett's book, although it slips now 
and then, is on the whole singularly fine ; it is fin- 
ished and graceful, at once delicate and strong, and 
never relapses into prosiness. The translations intro- 
duced are numerous, largely made by Dr. Garnett 
himself, and are exceptionally successful in repro- 
ducing both the thought and the form of their orig- 
inals. 

Mr. Reginald Statham, in " Paul 
Kruger and his Times " (L. C. Page 
& Co.) gives an account of the rise 
of the South African Republic, a small and remote 
country lately made conspicuous by the fiasco of the 
Jameson Raid, and the development of the Kruger 
family, newly illustrious through its worthy repre- 
sentative Paul Kruger, beloved by his own people 
as " Oom Paul," the biographical and historical ele- 
ments appearing to be quite inseparable. The nar- 
rative is well sustained, the situations are strongly 
picturesque, and the contrasts and parallels are 
handled with the skill of a trained advocate. The 
reader, however, is compelled to feel that there must 
be a respondent in the case, whose presentation, 
though different, might be equally interesting, per- 
haps equally convincing. 

Gladstone Nothing better in its way has ever 

delineated by come to our notice than Mr. James 
Mr. Bryee. Bryce's study of Gladstone (Century 

Co.). The little book is a model of pith and com- 
pression and effective breadth of delineation, and it 
should be read and conned by everyone desiring a 
competent knowledge of this foremost of Victorian 
statesmen. Mr. Gladstone's life was long, and sin- 
gularly eventful ; his character was as complex as 
his pursuits were multifarious ; and for almost half 
a century his career was so closely interwoven 
with the public affairs of his country that the story 
of his parliamentary life comes near to being an 
outline of concurrent English politics. Yet in the 
brief space of 104 small pages, Mr. Bryce has man- 
aged to give us a portrait that for essential truth is 
likely to remain unsurpassed. He discusses his hero 
as parliamentarian, orator, and author, and there 
are separate chapters on his social qualities, his 
" originality and independence," his religious char- 
acter, and so on. The book contains a striking 
frontispiece portrait. 

A suitable complement to Mr. Bryce's 
somewhat abstract and analytical 
study is Mr. Lionel Tollemache's 
capital little volume entitled " Talks with Mr. Glad- 
stone (Longmans). Mr. Tollemache has attempted 
very successfully, though in a small way, to Bos- 
wellize Mr. Gladstone, with whom he had a number 
of rather serious talks on topics literary, political, 



Gladstone

and religious, and whom he seems to have " drawn 
oat" very skilfully. The -talks" ranged from 
1856 to 1870, and from 1891 to 1896 ; and they 
certainly offer a good many curiosities, even eccen- 
tricities, of opinion. Perhaps Mr. Gladstone liked to 
be paradoxical on occasion. Once, when Mr. Tolle- 
mache asked him at what period he wished his lot 
could have been thrown ( he had already expressed 
his own preference for the nineteenth century), the 
liberal leader replied : I should have chosen the 
time of Homer." Commenting on Dives, he ob- 
served : " I look upon him as a very mild instance. 
As landlords go, he was above the average; he did let 
Lazarus have of his superfluities." Mr. Tollemache 
has reported his " talks " nearly verbatim, and they 
are decidedly fresh, interesting, and suggestive. The 
frontispiece portrait is evidently from a quite recent 
photograph, and is painfully suggestive of the long 
period of suffering that preceded Mr. Gladstone's 
death. 

In Outlines of the Earth's History " 
( Appleton ), Professor S baler, of 
Harvard University, has supplied a 
much-needed compendium of physiography. Illus- 
trating his statements from a copious fund of mate- 
rial authenticated by careful observation, experi- 
ment, and research, the author describes and 
explains the processes now active in earth, sea, air, 
and the surrounding universe. He holds that the 
history of the earth is a continuous record, whose 
most instructive chapter is that now being written. 
Nature's laws change not. That which is is that 
which hath been, and the present is the interpreter 
of the past. Professor S baler's style is clear, pleas- 
ant, and persuasive, and the book will appeal to the 
popular reader as well as to the student of this most 
fascinating science. 



O*tlit* of the

BRIEFER MENTION. 

A catalogue of the Dante collection presented to 
Cornell University by Professor Willard Fiske is in 
course of preparation by Mr. Theodore W. Koch, whose 
" Dante in America " we reviewed about a year ago. 
The first part of this catalogue, including only " Dante's 
Works " (in the original and translations) has just been 
published at Ithaca, and forms a quarto pamphlet of 
nearly a hundred double-column pages. Two further 
parts are being prepared, and the work will be paged 
continuously. The entries include, besides strictly bib- 
liographical particulars, such additional matter as notes 
on the textual value of the editions, extracts from ex- 
planatory prefaces, and occasional bits of authoritative 
quotation. 

Mr. Mosher's dainty publications are always welcome, 
and all the more so when they come unexpected, as in 
the case of the booklet recently issued. Our Ambassador 
to England, Mr. John Hay, was a guest of the Omar 
Khayyam Club in London at a dinner last December, 
and made a brief address so felicitous that it well de- 
served the honor of the present publication. All Omar 
collectors will want these words " In Praise of Omar," 



and will thank the publisher for having given them so 
exquisite a dress. Two or three apt quotations in prose 
and verse, from Mr. Aldrich, Mr. J. II. McCarthy, and 
Mrs. Marriott- Watson, add to the charm of this minia- 
ture volume. 

Although so many thousand cases have been decided 
by the higher Federal Courts, few embrace the great 
basic principles of Constitutional Law. For the con- 
venience of students and others having occasion to refer 
to them, Dr. Carl Evans Boyd has edited sixty- three 
representative cases under the title " Cases on Consti- 
tutional Law " (Callaghan'). They extend from Cbis- 
holm vs. Georgia to In re Debs and will prove of value 
as ready references. 

Messrs. Copeland & Day deserve the lasting grati- 
tude of book-lovers for the series of volumes in which 
they have reproduced certain of the sonnet-sequences of 
English poetry Rossetti, Mrs. Browning, and others. 
Their latest issue is the volume of " Shakespeare's 
Sonnets," printed, like its predecessors, in the manner 
made so familiar by the Kelmscott Press of William 
Morris, with ornamental designs by Mr. Bertram Gros- 
venor Goodhue. This edition follows the divisions of 
the sonnets made by Mr. Charles Armitage Brown, 
marking the two main sections with bordered pages, and 
the subdivisions with larger initials than those com- 
monly used. 

Miss Mary E. Butt, who has done so much excellent 
work in the preparation of reading-books for children, 
has collaborated with Mrs. George W. Cable in the edit- 
ing of " The Eugene Field Book " (Scribner), a collec- 
tion of verses, stories, and letters for school reading. 
Miss Burt has made her selections " upon a basis fur- 
nished by the children themselves, after repeated expe- 
riments," and the extracts " have been graded and 
arranged, after repeated tests, in the order of their 
simplicity." The book has an introduction by Mr. 
Cable, a sheaf of Field's letters to his children, and a 
chapter of annotated autobiography. 

The semi-annual bound volume of " The Land of 
Sunshine " (December to June) makes the accustomed 
good showing in text and illustrations. The latter are 
more profuse, and of a better average quality, thau 
heretofore, and present effectively many charming 
phases of California life and landscape. The notes by 
the editor, Mr. Charles F. Lummis, are a strong fea- 
ture of this periodical, piquant, vigorous, independent, 
and representing an Americanism of the truer and more 
stable sort which we have none too much of in Cali- 
fornia or anywhere else just now. Published at 501 
Stimson Building, Los Angeles.

Bishop Hall, of Woolwich, and the full title is: "Quo 
Vadis? A just Censure of Travell; as is commonly 
undertaken by the Gentlemen of our Nation. London, 
1617." 

Dr. W. C. Hollopeter, of Philadelphia, has just pub- 
lished, through Messrs. P. Blakiston's Son & Co., a 
work on " Hay-Fever and Its Successful Treatment." 
The book is certainly timely, and its readers will take 
heart at the author's statement that he has given " com- 
plete relief " to hundreds of patients in his private 
practice. A spray of goldenrod appropriately ornaments 
the cover. 

The " Stories from the Classic Literature of Many 
Nations " (Macmillan), which have been edited by Miss 
Bertha Palmer, are intended for children, whether in or 
out of school, and have a range wide enough to include 
stories from Egyptian, Chinese, Japanese, Babylonian, 
Hindu, Finnish, and American Indian sources. Most of 
them are given in the texts of the standard translations, 
while a few are retold by the editor. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sous are about to issue a 
most important book upon Dante, by Mr. Edmund G. 
Gardner, of Cambridge. It is entitled " Dante's Ten 
Heavens," and is confined to a study of the Paradise. 
Based upon mediaeval and modern commentaries, it is a 
lofty and sympathetic discussion of Dante's conception 
of the eternal glory of Paradise. Longfellow's transla- 
tion is the English text quoted throughout. 

Readers of the New York " Evening Post " have been 
lately entertained by a series of sketches of life in 
Manilla, by Mr. Joseph Earle Stevens. We presume 
that the volume on " The Philippines " by this writer, 
announced for early publication by the Messrs. Scribner, 
will prove to be, at least in part, a reproduction of these 
sketches, and we can cordially recommend it in advance 
of its appearance. It will be illustrated from photo- 
graphs taken by the writer. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett, & Co. have just completed 
their series of school readers entitled " Stepping Stones to 
Literature," by the publication of the seventh and eighth 
volumes. The selections, with few exceptions, belong 
to good literature, and have a greater average length 
than is usual in books of this class. They have been 
compiled by Miss Sarah Louise Arnold and Mr. Charles 
B. Gilbert. The two volumes now published are de- 
voted, respectively, to American and English authors. 

Word comes from abroad that Mrs. E. L. Voynich is 
dramatizing her novel, " The Gadfly," which has already 
reached its eleventh edition here. Mrs. Voynich will 
have a rare opportunity for stage display, her scene 
being Italy during the Austrian domination. Many of 
the episodes in her book could almost be acted as they

[July 16, 



stand, among them the appearance of the Gadflj with 
the gypy girl at the reception in Florence, the patting 
of the mountebanks, the fight in the square of the moun- 
tain town, the scene in the prison between father and 
son, the military execution, and the great fete in the 
cathedral. 

We wonder how many of onr readers know that 
Girard College has an endowment fund that gives it 
larger resources than are enjoyed by the wealthiest of 
our universities. The present value of its property in 
nearly twenty-seven millions of dollars, and one cannot 
help asking whether it is doing the work that might 
reasonably be expected from a capital so enormous. 
Those who are curious in the matter may find out just 
what it has done and is doing by reference to the recently 
published account of the " Semi-Centenuial of Girard 
College." Besides the proceedings of this celebration, the 
volume contains a biography of Girard, a copy of his 
will, and other documents. It is edited by Mr. George 
P. Hupp, Librarian of the College. 

Karl Marx was a suggestive writer, no doubt, but his 
theories on political economy were bristling with fallacy. 
For instance, he regarded labor and value as tantamount 
to the same thing. This and other errors in his reason- 
ing were exposed by Professor Eugen von Bohm- 
Bawerk, the Austrian Minister of Finance, in a treatise 
ostensibly published in honor of Professor Karl Kneis. 
But the treatise really amounts to a smashing refutation 
of the Marxian system, and is of cosmopolitan import- 
ance. Hence Miss Alice M. Macdonald has been at the 
pains to translate it in a volume entitled " Karl Marx 
and the Close of his System." To it Dr. James Bonar 
has contributed an argumentative preface. The volume 
is published in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

The Oxford University Press has nearly finished 
printing the first part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, which 
is being edited by Messrs. B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt 
for the Egypt Exploration Fund. The volume, which 
will appear at the end of the present month, contains 
158 texts, 31 being literary, and including the early 
fragments of St. Matthew's Gospel, Sappho, Aristoxenus, 
Sophocles, and of other lost and extant classics. The 
remainder is a selection of official and private documents 
dating from the first to the seventh century of our era, 
many of them of exceptional interest. The texts are 
accompanied by introductions, notes, and, in most cases, 
by translations. There are eight collotype plates illus- 
trating the papyri of principal literary and palteograph- 
ical importance. 

The annual gathering of booksellers and publishers' 
representatives at Chicago, which has been held for 
several years past, is this year an event of more than 
usual interest to the trade. Most of the American 
houses have forwarded exhibits containing sample copies 
of their publications for the inspection of their custo- 
mers, and a considerable portion of the Palmer House 
is converted into a book bazar for the occasion. Book- 
sellers from all parts of the West and South, and even 
from the Pacific Coast, make their annual literary pil- 
grimage to this unique book fair, which gives them an 
opportunity for inspecting and selecting stock such as 
they could not otherwise obtain. The advance copies 
and prospectuses of works in press make a good promise 
for the Fall season, and the reports of those in attend- 
ance are on the whole encouraging as to the conditions 
and prospects of the trade. The gathering is to continue 
through July and a part of August.

THE SINGER 

Automatic Chain-stitch 
Sewing-Machine. 

Highest type for all purposes in which a 

chain-stitch can be used. Owing to the simple 
design, the small number of wearing parts, 
and superior material and workmanship, it is 
of remarkable durability and efficiency. 

Especially distinguished for compactness, absolute 
noiselessness, and light-running qualities. 

Adapted to a wide range of work, upon almost any 
variety of fabric. Its capacity under the arm is greater 
than that of any similar machine. 

The frame is cast in one piece, and is remarkably 
rigid and free from vibration. The feed has a positive 
motion, and the length of stitch is easily adjusted with- 
out use of springs. 

The automatic tension always supplies exactly 
the correct length of thread for each stitch, and requires 
no adjustment.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



Following our custom of past years, we pre- 
sent, in this and the following issue of THE 
DIAL, a condensation of the annual summary 
of the literature of Continental Europe pre- 
pared for " The Athenaeum " by special con- 
tributors from the countries concerned. The 
articles upon which we have drawn are by Pro- 
fessor Paul Fredericq for Belgium, Professor 
V. Tille for Bohemia, Dr. Alfred Ipsen for 
Denmark, M. Brunetiere for France, Hofrath 
Robert Zimmermann for Germany, Mr. S. P. 
Lambros for Greece, Heer H. S. M. van Wicke- 
voort Crommelin for Holland, Mr. Leopold 
Katscher for Hungary, Herr Christian Brinch- 
mann for Norway, Dr. Adam Belcikowski for 
Poland, Mr. Constantino Balmont for Russia, 
Don Rafael Altamira for Spain, and Herr 
Hugo Tigerschiold for Sweden. The Italian 
summary is omitted for this year, owing to the 
fact that Commendatore Giacosa, who was to 
have written it, was prevented from completing 
his task by unavoidable demands upon his atten- 
tion. This general acknowledgment of the 
sources of the information in the present article, 
and the one to follow in our next number, will 
make further credit unnecessary ; but we can- 
not fail to add a word of appreciation of the 
enterprise of our English contemporary in pro- 
viding these summaries from year to year, and 
of our indebtedness for the information which 
they contain. 

" In France for some years past [writes M. Brune- 
tiere] we have got into an annoying habit of considering 
as relevant to literature ' only collections of verse, 
novels, dramatic pieces, and occasionally studies in crit- 
icism or literary history. Many reasons might be given 
for this; the principal is that all the world considers 
itself fit to decide the value of a vaudeville or a novel; 
and, in fact, a novel or a vaudeville is addressed to all 
the world. In the second place, their only aim is to 
' please.' The engrossing claims of art are more obvi- 
ous, more constantly in evidence here than in a book of 
history or philosophy for instance, and here no effort is 
made to teach the reader or improve his morals. No 
petty piece is played at the Alcazar or the Eldorado 
without finding the immediate support of twenty writers 
of feuilletons to criticize it. No novel by, say, M. Zola 
or M. Paul Bourget is published without being fully 
chronicled on the very day of its appearance. And in 
some journals at least, or in some reviews, if the poets

[Aug. 1, 



are infinitely less befriended than the novelists, yet they 
are spoken of and discussed. But the historians, the 
scholars, the philosophers, are left in the cold." 

The writer makes up for this neglect, as far as 
possible, by devoting his article very largely to 
works that are not " literature " in the narrow 
sense. First of all, he discusses at length such 
books as " Esquisse d'une Philosophic de la 
Religion d'apres la Psychologic et 1'Histoire," 
by M. Auguste Sabatier ; " Le Catholicisme," 
by M. Pierre Laffitte ; "Le Cardinal Man- 
ning," by M. Francis de Pressense ; and " Le 
Congres des Religions," by M. Victor Char- 
bonnel. Of the last of these, he says : 

" It is one of the most curious and interesting to be 
read anywhere, because M. Charbonnel seldom takes 
upon himself to speak ; he leaves that to numerous cor- 
respondents consulted by him all over the world on the 
advisability of a Congress of Religions; and they have 
extremely divergent views on the question. Bat what 
he has not seen is that if it is easy to make a Bud- 
dhist, a Mohammedan, a Christian, and a Freethinker 
agree in certain common principles, it is done by ranking 
them as ' philosophers ' or < rationalists,' and not at all 
as faithful adherents to a communion." 

All these books, he remarks, " point to the 
undoubted conclusion that, for some time past, 
in France as well as in Europe, more attention 
than ever is being paid to religious questions, 
above all in their connection with social ques- 
tions." The plays of the year also support this 
conclusion, as may be illustrated by the " Re pas 
du Lion," by M. Francois de Curel ; the 
" Mauvais Bergers " of M. Octave Mirbeau ; 
the " Vassale " of M. Jules Case ; and the 
" Aine'e " of M. Jules Lemaitre. A great num- 
ber of dramas in verse have also appeared, such 
as the " Fre'de'gonde " of M. Dubont, the 
" Cyrano de Bergerac " of M. E. Rostand, the 
" Don Juan de Manara " of M. Haraucourt, 
the - Martyre " of M. Jean Richepin, and the 
" Ville Morte " of M. G. d'Annunzio. 

" The ' Ville Morte ' is a poem in prose, in which 
observations of a very subtle pyscbology, realistic and 
symbolic by turns, are expressed in a language both 
romantic and precise. On the contrary, the Fre'de'- 
gonde ' of M. Dubout and the Martyre ' of M. Richepin 
are respectively pseudo-classic tragedy, and drama or 
melodrama of the false romantic sort, and the more 
artificial for the bias of realism exhibited by their au- 
thors. The first is taken from the ' Re*cits Me'rovingiens ' 
of Augustin Thierry, the second from some nondescript 
confusion of the essence of Christianity with the pro- 
fanest element in the passions of love. A similar com- 
bination is readily discernible in the ' Don Juan ' of 
M. Haraucourt; the atmosphere is that of an ardent 
sensuality, also studied in the ' Passe* ' of M. 6. de Porto 
Riche." 

Of " Cyrano de Bergerac," we read that 

" Its success is, I have no doubt, known to most of my 



readers, and Heaven forbid that I should deny its sin- 
gular merit! It has life, youth, and gaiety, but for a 
five-act piece in verse it lacks depth and originality 
somewhat. This is not an essential point, and does not 
raise any question of art or groundwork. M. Rostand 
is an admirable artist, and his present play marks a 
decided advance on his previous efforts. He must, how- 
ever, mould his verse to a more preeious metal of more 
homogeneity and strength." 

Among the poets, the following volumes are 
the most important, although the best of them 
lack not exactly originality, but personality ": 
Bois Sacre*," by M. le Vte. de Guerne ; " Jeux 
Rustiques et Divins," by M. Henri de Kcgnier ; 
Au Jardin de 1' Infante," by M . Samain ; 
"La Clarte" de Vie," by M. Francis Vielc- 
Griffin ; and " Poemes Fabuleux," by M. Henri 
Ronger. Turning to the novels, only bare men- 
tion is made of Boisfleury," by M. Theuriet ; 
" Jacquine Vanesse," by M. Cherbuliez ; " Sou- 
tien de Famille," by Alphonse Daudet ; " Com- 
plications Sen timen tales," by M. Bourget ; and 
the Paris " of M. Zola. On the other hand, 
five novels are singled out for analysis, because 
they all mark what we call a ' date ' in the 
career of their authors." They are " Le Man- 
nequin d'Osier," by M. France ; " La Cathe 1 - 
drale," by M. Huysmans ; " Les De'racine's," 
by M. Barres ; Le Desastre," by MM. Paul 
and Victor Margueritte ; and - Le Manage du 
Pastor Naudie," by M. Rod. 

" Other novels worth notice are ' Temple d'Amour,' 
by M. K'Miiv Saint-Maurice; 'Golo/ by M. Pol Neveux; 
1 Devant le Bonheur,' by M. Jean Thorel; ' La Confes- 
sion (I'u a Enfant du Siege,' by M. M. Corday; and the 
1 Saint Cendre ' of M. Maindron. This last author, I 
warn the reader, is not for bread-and-butter misses. 
To write a history of the sixteenth century and to get 
thoroughly at home, M. Maindron has re-read Brantome, 
one can see, and not forgotten him sufficiently." 

Much interesting correspondence has appeared 
during the year, notably the letters of Merimee, 
Balzac, Lamennais, Hugo, and Renan. Criti- 
cism and literary history are represented by a 
great number of works, and we have space for 
only a few of the more prominent titles. The 
following seem particularly worthy of mention : 
" Nevroses," by Madame A. Barine ; " 1 tusk in 
et la Religion de la Beaute," by M. Robert de 
la Sizeranne ; " Ecrivains Etrangers," by M. T. 
de Wyze"wa ; " Henri Heine," by M. J. Legras ; 
" Ferdinand Lassalle," by M. Ernest Seilliere ; 
" Richard Wagner, Poete et Penseur," by M. 
Henri Lichtenberger ; " La Philosophic de 
Nietzsche," by the same writer ; " La Podsie 
Italienne Contemporaine," by "Jean Dornis "; 
" Choses et Gens d'Ame*rique," by " Th. Bent- 
con"; "La Findu Classicisme dans les Der- 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



63 



nieres Annees du XVIIIe Siecle," by M. Louis 
Bertrand ; " L'Elegie en France depuis Parny 
jusqu'a Lamartine," by M. Henri Potez ; 
" Drame Ancien, Drame Moderne," by M. 
Emile Faguet ; and M. Brunetiere's own " Man- 
uel de 1'Histoire de la Litterature FranQaise." 
Finally, historical scholarship is represented 
by such works as " Voltaire avant et pendant 
la Guerre de Sept Ans," by the Due de Broglie ; 
" Histoire et Poesie," by the Vte. E. M. de 
Vogue ; " Letters Inedites de Napoleon ler," 
edited by M. Lecestre ; " Napoleon et la Fam- 
ille," by M. Frederic Masson ; " La Jeunesse 
de Napoleon," by M. Arthur Chuquet ; and 
M. Renouvier's " Philosophic Analytique de 
1'Histoire." The article ends with the follow- 
ing suggestive paragraph : 

" I may say also that history is the gate by which 
ideas enter into literature. And, as I indicated at the 
beginning of this article, it is not sufficient for a book 
to be full of ideas to be qualified as ' literature ': it must 
have some qualities of form and style which raise it 
above its fellows. But it is not enough for its form to 
be original or exquisite: it must contain ideas, too ! 
Nothing is more generally admitted in theory, at least, 
and discussion and nothing is more forgotten by his- 
torians of literature, or less put into practice, than this 
two-sided truism." 

Belgium, as is well known, has two literary 
languages, and this year something must be 
said of a third. The Belgian Germans who 
live on the frontier of Luxembourg and the 
Rhineland have begun a literary movement of 
their own which has resulted in the production 
of a number of books, of which two noteworthy 
examples are " Ludwig Tieck als Dramaturg," 
by Herr Bischoff, and "Die Kritik in der 
Englischen Literatur des 17 und 18 Jahrhun- 
derts," by Herr Paul Hamelius. The Belgian 
French books of the year include a final volume 
of Laveleye's " Essais et Etudes "; a work on 
the " Socialistes Anglais," by M. P. Verhaegen ; 
" Ce Que Flnde Doit a la Grece," by M. le 
Comte Goblet d'Alviella : a book on Wagner's 
" Meistersinger," by M. Maurice Kufferath ; 
and " La Vie et 1'Art en Autriche-Hongrie," 
by M. J. G. Freson. There is nothing very 
noticeable in poetry and fiction, although nu- 
merous titles are cited. Among the Belgian 
Flemish books, on the other hand, several works 
of pure literature are prominent. They are : 
" Madeleine," by Miss Virginie Loveling ; 
" Wrakken " (Wreck), by Heer E. de Bom ; 
" Aan 't Minnewater," by Heer Maurits Sabbe, 
a decidedly taking sketch of the life of the 
inhabitants of Bruges ; and " Schoppenboer " 
(The Knave of Spades), by Heer Cyriel Buysse, 



"the Flemish Zola, who once again brings 
before us unabashed the crime and shame of 
the brutalized peasants and coarse poachers of 
certain parts of Flanders." Dramatic litera- 
ture, also, shows signs of originality in such 
pieces as " De Bruid van Quinten Metsys " 
(The Bride of Quinten Metsys), by Heer H. 
de Marez ; " Koning Hagen," by Heer Huibert 
Melis ; and " Starkadd," by Heer Alfred Heg- 
enscheidt. 

The most characteristic event of the Dutch 
literary year is the appearance of the fourth 
and last volume of Professor H. P. G. Quack's 
" De Socialisten." 

" The author has devoted over twenty years to chroni- 
cling the evolution of Socialism from Plato's time to 
the present day. His aim is to describe and explain the 
historic phenomenon of Socialism in the nineteenth cen- 
tury, to urge upon the reader that this ideal is more 
than a passing error, and to depict the principal Socialist 
thinkers of all times." 

Socialism, or at least sociology, seems to be the 
chief subject of the day in Holland, as is 
further evidenced by Mrs. Goekoop's " Hilda 
van Suylenburg," a plea in fiction for the eman- 
cipation of women, Miss Helene Mercier's 
" Sociale Schetsen," Dr. C. J. Wynaendts 
Francken's " Sociale Ethiek," a collection of 
"Verzamelde Opstellen," by the principal 
Dutch advocates of socialism, and the poems of 
the socialist editor, Heer Herman Gorter. 
Something of a surprise is the volume of " Ver- 
zen " by Heer P. C. Boutens, a new writer. 
Works of fiction include " Psyche," a parable 
by Heer Couperus ; " De Roman van Bernard 
Bandt," by Heer H. Robbers ; " Het Eene 
Noodige " (The One Thing Needful), by Miss 
Anna de Savornin Lohman ; and " Barthold 
Meryan," a socialistic novel by Miss Cornelie 
Huyghens. More serious works are the philo- 
sophical " Studies " of Dr. F. van Eeden, the 
" Gouden Eeuw " (Golden Age) of Dr. J. P. 
Muller, and the " Era of the Patriots," by Dr. 
H. T. Colenbrander. 

The Spanish summary does not say a word 
about the present war, which would seem to be 
non-existent as far as its effect upon the pro- 
duction of books is concerned. History and 
the allied departments of knowledge still en- 
gage the best intellectual energies of the Span- 
iards, and of the many important works de- 
scribed a few must be named here. 

" The first place is due to the voluminous and inter- 
esting collection of ' Relaciones Geograficas de Indias,' 
the opening volume of which appeared in 1881, the 
second in 1885, and the last two in 1897. Its import- 
ance lies in the fact that the immense majority of the 



64

documents contained in it are official that ia to say, 
papers from the earliest times of the discovery, drawn 
up by our navigators, explorers, and authorities in 
America by order of the kings and Council of the Indies 
for the purpose of affording a knowledge in full detail 
of the new countries, and furnishing in this way a founda- 
tion solid and positive for the governmental arrange- 
ments which were framed in Spain for the colonies." 

Other historical works are " Los Origenes del 
Justioia de Aragon," by Don Julian Ribera ; 
Alquimia en Espafia," by Professor Luanco ; 
and the first two volumes of a " Historia Critica 
y Documentada de las Comunidades de Cas- 
tilla," edited by Sefior Danvila. A great crit- 
ical edition of the works of Quevedo is well 
under way. Fiction is represented by the " 1 
Abuelo " of Sefior Galdos, two small volumes 
of stories by Don Juan Valera, " El Saludo de 
las Brujas," by Sefiora Bazan, and " Fignra y 
Paisatje," a collection of tales by SeSor Nar- 
ciso Oiler. " Poets continue to crop up in 
Catalonia," and " on the stage there is abso- 
lutely nothing new of any note to be chroni- 
cled/' are the two most interesting of the items 
remaining to be quoted. 

In Greece, 

11 The unfortunate war against Tnrkey has been pre- 
judicial to the literary production of the twelvemonth. 
It has led to various hasty and inferior records of its 
history. The best historical work of the year is the 
History of the Empire of Nicsea and the Despotism of 
Epirns (1204-1261),' by Mr. Anton Miliarakis, who 
is well known for a number of excellent works on geog- 
raphy. His present subject deserves special notice, as 
it has not been treated by anyone since Finlay's time, 
whose work was then comprehensive, but it is not ade- 
quate now in view of the fresh material available. The 
relation of Finlay to the history of the Empire of Niwea 
is much the same as that of Fallmerayer to the ' History 
of the Empire of Trebizond,' his book with that title 
being the best he ever wrote. But here, too, seventy 
years have enlarged the material which the German 
historian used, and Mr. Tryphon Evangelides was happy 
in bis choice of the same subject, in spite of the fact 
that further unedited matter by Dr. Papadopulos Kera- 
meus and Professor Lambros is announced, but still 
unpublished." 

Other historical works are a " History of Nau- 
plia from the Oldest Times to the Present Day," 
by Mr. Michael Lambrynides ; " The Greek 
Schools in Roumania," by Mr. Theodurus 
Athanasiu ; and " Foreign Rule and Kingship 
in Greece, 1821-1897," by Mr. George Phil- 
are tos. Miscellaneous literature is represented 
by a work on Plato's " Laws," by Mr. Miltiades 
Pantazis ; " Music among the Ancient Greeks 
and the Delphic Hymn to Apollo," by Mr. 
Themistokles Polykrates ; " Sea Tactics of the 
Ancients," by Mr. Konstantin Rados ; " The 
Dream of Janniris," a novel by Mr. Johann 



Psycharis ; " The Victory of Leonidas," a com- 
edy by Mr. Charalambos Anninos ; and " Rhi- 
gas," a tragedy by Mr. A. Provelegios. Two 
volumes of poetry are the " Grave," by Mr. 
Kostis Palatnas, and " Songs of the Desert," 
by Mr. Konstantin Hatzopulos. 

Literary Hungary, according to its present 
chronicler, is making gratifying progress. 

' We never had so many writers of all kinds as at 
present. Our wealth of expression is increasing rapidly, 
our language is daily becoming finer, richer, more varied, 
and with the increase in the number of authors coincides 
an astonishing widening of the circle of readers. The 
heroes of the revolution of 1848, the jubilee of which 
we celebrated a few months ago, could not have imagined 
that the sale of an Hungarian novel would ever reach 
6,000 to 8,000 copies, or that an enormous work like 
the ' Pallas Great Lexicon,' the Hungarian Encyclopedia 
Britannica which I have already mentioned more 
than once, and the sixteenth and concluding volume of 
which saw the light recently would ever become a 
possibility, and obtain, as it did, a circulation of 30,000. 
Anyone who had ventured to predict a time when the 
aggregate issue of the metropolitan dailies would exceed 
100,000 copies would have been ridiculed as a patriotic 
dreamer." 

While the national drama is in a state of decay, 
fiction and poetry flourish exceedingly. Besides 
many short stories and lesser novels, two works 
of fiction have made a great stir. They are 
" The Dawn Is Sure to Come," by Mr. Gyula 
Werner ; and " The Immigrants," by Mrs. 
Szikra. The author of the latter book lashes 
most severely the snobbism of the lower gentry 
of Hungary, who endeavour to intrude upon the 
aristocracy proper. She writes with a full 
knowledge of things and persons about these 
adventurers without means and manners." The 
great poetical success of the year is Mr. Andor 
Kozma's " Satires." " This is a truly splendid 
production. Though bitingly sarcastic, these 
timely verses are never really injurious. The 
poet's art in mastering the most difficult forms 
of versification is admirable." Other important 
books are " The Life and Work of Michael 
Munkacsy," by Mr. Dezso Malonyay ; " Trav- 
els in the Caucasus," by Count Jeno Zichy ; 
" Adam Smith's System and Its Philosophical 
Basis," by Mr. Akos Navratil ; " The Social 
System of Thomas Carlyle," by Mr. Eugen 
Gaul ; a treatise on " Art," by * our foremost 
philosopher," Mr. Bernat Alexander ; and 
" The Fortunatus Legend in Literature," by 
Professor Lazar. Lastly, the jubilee of 1848 
has given rise to a number of important histor- 
ical books, such as Mr. Gyorgy Graeza's " His- 
tory of the Struggle for Independence," Mr. 
Jokai-Brody's " 1848," and Mr. Boross-Laur- 
encic's " Album of the Struggle for Freedom."

ENGLISH AND SPANISH SEA POWER.* 

The wondrousness of the Elizabethan age is 
a commonplace, but one phase of it the dis- 
location of the Spanish colonial empire by the 
daring achievements of Raleigh, Grenville, 
Drake, and Hawkins has a peculiar interest 
for us who are to-day watching the breaking 
of the last link in the chain. Mr. Corbett's 
history of " Drake and the Tudor Navy " is, 
therefore, particularly apposite. In reading it 
one feels that the thought of the nation is the 
thought of the race, and is conscious of the 
moral and racial connection between those cap- 
tains then and these to-day. 

Probably no spot on the surface of England 
of equal area was so fertile in men of action 
in the time of Elizabeth as Devonshire. The 
group of unforgotten heroes that issued thence 
Hawkins, Drake, Raleigh flung the En- 
glish flag around the globe, and, as one has 
said, " hit, as with ceaseless lightning-strokes, 
the ships and coasts and power of Spain." The 
Elizabethan seaman was no mere sailor. He 
was of the age in which he lived, and was lifted 
up by large ideas and grand purposes. The 
passion for adventure and discovery which led 
Frobisher into three vain voyages in search of 
the Northwest Passage, and sent Sir John Davis 
on the elusive Cathayan quest, was only equalled 
by English hatred of the Spaniard, whether as 
a cruel trader, a heartless colonist, or an inquis- 
itorial fanatic. The mixture of these motives 
of the corsair and the theologian resulted in 
that curious combination of Puritanism and 
piracy which is a psychic feature of the epoch. 
One of the most interesting paragraphs Mr. 
Corbett has penned is this : 

" To men who went to their Bible for their opinions 
as we go to our newspapers, the Papists easily became 
Egyptians to be despoiled, Amalekites to be destroyed. 
It was a creed that came comfortably to a pirate, and 
yet it would be to misread the times to doubt that it 
was not also a real conviction. To the earnest, and 
particularly the uneducated, Protestant, the Catholics 
were idolaters. For him the mass was an abomination, 
as honestly loathed as by earnest Catholics it was de- 
voutly loved. The two sentiments are correlative, and 
to ignore the force of the one is to underrate the depth 
of the other. Nor must we forget the large class that 
stood between the two extremes of religious opinion, 
a class of men ambitious of name and fortune, bent on 
achieving their careers, and yet by instinct or education

scrupulous enough to reject any means for which a re- 
ligious sanction was not to be found. . . . The chaplain 
of Drake's ship . . . solemnly told him that it was law- 
ful to recover his losses upon the King of Spain; and 
Bishop Jewell, we are told, had given to Elizabeth his 
opinion that to exact reprisals from the Spaniards would 
be pleasing in the sight of God." 

Francis Drake was the son of a Devonshire 
farmer, and was born in the mid-years of the 
English revolt against Rome. The seed of 
Catholic hatred was in the family. In his boy- 
hood, " so clear was the issue, so intense the 
party feeling, that children forgot their games 
to play at politics. They snowballed the Span- 
ish ambassador ; they fought mock- combats 
between Wyatt and the Prince of Spain, and 
once were barely prevented from hanging the 
lad who played the part of Philip." His father, 
who had suffered in his fortunes, got a place 
among the seamen in the King's navy to read 
prayers to them, and during his famous son's 
early years was stationed at Grillingham Reach, 
just below Chatham, which was the eastern 
headquarters of the navy. Here, " where the 
old navy hulks were like playfellows, and the 
river a taskmaster to be learned and humored," 
Drake got the first bent toward the sea which 
his kinship with Hawkins confirmed. When 
he was eighteen he went with the latter as third 
officer of a ship to Biscay. Soon after, at a 
time which cannot be determined, and on an 
unknown vessel, he shipped to the Indies. In 
1567 he joined Hawkins's third Indian voyage. 
On this expedition the affair of Nombre de Dios 
won him a command. A three-years independ- 
ent voyage followed (1571-1574), during 
which Drake systematically rifled the towns of 
the Spanish Main. It was on this trip that 
from the ridge of the Cordilleras the first En- 
glish eyes saw the wondrous waters of the South 
Sea open before them ; and then it was that the 
ambition was born within him to circumnavi- 
gate the globe. But though Drake was the first 
commander so to do (1577-1580), the great- 
ness of this feat lies rather in his marvellous 
seamanship, and as the prophecy of English 
colonial empire, than in rounding Cape Horn 
and crossing the Pacific. In Drake's time the 
problem of the navigation of the North Pacific 
had been solved, so that " this part of his feat," 
as Mr. Corbett points out, " can in no way com- 
pare with Magellan's heroic venture across what 
was then an absolutely trackless waste." 

When one reads of the amazing difficulties 
which Drake met from storm and tempest off 
the Straits, one can well believe that to English- 
men the empire of the sea is given. Let Mr.

Corbett and the log of the Golden Hind tell 
the story of Drake's adventures off Cape Horn : 
" They were involved in a maze of tortuous channels 
where, buffeted hither and thither by constantly chang- 
ing wind* that without warning swept down upon them 
in icy squalls from every direction, they were in contin- 
ual danger of wreck. Above them frowned tiers of 
glaciers and peaks higher and more fantastic than they 
bad ever seen. Below them were depths no cable could 
fathom. All the terrors of the abandoned passage 
were about them, and they seemed at the mercy of 
God. Still they struggled on, and by the seventeenth 
day bad the South Sea before them. . . . For two days 
they stood northwest . . . and the wont of their dan- 
gers seemed past, when they were struck by a gale from 
the northeast which proved to be of a severity far beyond 
anything they had ever heard of. ' God,' says the Nar- 
rative, ' by a contrary wind and terrible tempest, seemed 
to set himself against us.' Day after day they drove in 
snow and darkness to west-southwest before a storm that 
continually increased in fury. To add to their terrors, 
at the end of tf week there was an eclipse of the moon, 
and a fortnight later, in the nighttime, the Marigold 
disappeared and was never heard of again. . . . By the 
end of the month they had been driven, as they calcu- 
lated, beyond the fifty-seventh parallel and some two 
hundred leagues to the westward. With October the 
weather slightly mended, and they managed to work 
back to the northeast, so that by the 7th they were able 
to anchor among some islands a little to the north of 
the point where they had emerged from the Straits. It 
was the first land they had seen since a month before 
they bad met the gale. Exhausted with their toil, they 
were enjoying the prospect of riding out the storm in 
peace, when, a few hours after anchoring, a squall caught 
them. The Golden Hind parted her cable, the Elizabeth 
had to slip hers, and though both vessels managed to 
regain the open sea, they almost immediately lost sight 
of each other and never met again. . . . Meanwhile, 
the Admiral was once more driven to the southward; 
nor was it until be had been carried as low as the fifty- 
fifth parallel that the terrific weather moderated. At 
this height he was able to run in among some islands; 
. . . but even here they had but little rest. In two 
days a renewal of the gale drove them from their an- 
chors, and increased to such violence that they regarded 
their escape from the lee shore and the unprecedented 
seas as no less than a miracle. When it abated a little 
they ran in again among some islands probably in 
Darwin Sound, not many leagues to the south of their 
former anchorage. But again the foul weather in- 
creased. The Golden Hind lost another anchor and 
cable, and once more Drake's consummate seamanship 
was like an interposition of Providence to save them. 
A storm of such fury and persistence was beyond all 
experience. ' The like of it,' says the Narrative, ' no 
traveller had felt, neither hath there ever been such a 
tempest that any records make mention of, so violent 
and of such continuance, since Noah's flood, for it lasted 
from September 7 to October 28 full fifty-two days.' " 

After these experiences, Drake, in a single 
vessel, continued his way northward, reaching 
the Chilian and Peruvian coasts, and finally 
falling in with the treasure-ship of the viceroy 
of Pern, laden with thirteen chests of pieces of 
eight, eighty pounds of gold and twenty-six tons 



of silver, besides jewels and plate. The effect 
of these daring enterprises upon the Spanish 
colonies was great. Mexico, Central America, 
the west coast, were filled with alarm. Prayers 
were offered in the churches for deliverance 
from Drake, and the Bishop of Guatemala 
offered the provincial governor the bells of 
his cathedral to be melted down into guns. 

Meanwhile Drake's sole thought was how to 
get home in safety. He believed that there 
was choice of four routes : one by the Moluccas 
and Cape of Good Hope ; one by the Straits of 
Magellan the way he had come ; a third by 
Norway, or " The Northeast Passage " of Ca- 
bot's Muscovy Company ; the fourth by the 
famous " Northwest Passage " which Martin 
Frobisher lived for and Hendrik Hudson died 
for. But the Admiral at last concluded that 
safety advised the known Portuguese route, 
and so, after skirting the coast of North Amer- 
ica beyond Cape Mendocino with no sign of 
the looked-for Straits, and having taken pos- 
session of California in the name of his Queen, 
he bent his course straight for the East Indies. 
The immortal voyage of nearly three years 
ended late in September, when the Golden 
Hind dropped anchor in Plymouth Sound. 
Knighthood was Drake's reward. 

The great man returned at a welcome mo- 
ment, for early in 1580 the last of the Avis, 
the reigning house of Portugal, had died, and 
Philip II. immediately laid claim to the throne 
in right of his wife. Protestant Europe was 
aghast. The political situation was a crisis. 

' If Philip bad been formidable before, he was doubly 
formidable now. Besides the whole of the East Indies, 
America, and the African settlements, he could claim 
all the Peninsula; of the Italian states, Sicily, Naples, 
Sardinia, and the Duchy of Milan; and in the north, all 
of what is now Holland and Belgium. ... To appre- 
ciate the prominence into which the new situation ulti- 
mately forced Drake, the position of other powers must 
be borne in mind. The Pope, between fear of the old 
rivalry of a real empire and hatred of the heretic powers, 
must be practically neutral. France was equally incapa- 
ble of action. She was at this time divided between the 
Valois king at Paris, representing the national Gallican 
Church, the Bourbon Henry of Navarre, head of the 
Huguenots and champion of reformation, and lastly, 
the Ultramontane Guises leaning on Rome and Spain. 
Germany was as much divided." 

It fell, then, upon England alone to face Spain's 
imperial designs and the counter-reformation. 
Drake, appealed to by Walsingham, with ready 
wit recommended the seizure of the Azores ; 
but the scheme failed because of Elizabeth's 
false policy of mixing commercialism and pol- 
itics. She allowed the Muscovy Company a 
share in the enterprise, so that it degenerated 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

into a disastrous filibustering expedition. As 
if to accomplish its ruin, Drake himself, much 
to his disgust, was kept at home, " because, in 
view of the warlike outlook, it was thought 
unwise to let him leave the country." But civil 
honors the mayoralty of Plymouth, member- 
ship in the Royal Navy Commission, and finally 
election to Parliament were paltry rewards 
for a man of action in those stirring times. 

At this point it is a matter of amazement to 
one unacquainted with the diplomacy of the 
sixteenth century to be told that, in spite of 
these years of privateering and reprisal by both 
Spain and England, the two powers were yet 
technically at peace. Mr. Corbett has some 
illuminating paragraphs upon the international 
law of the time. He says : 

" The feature of international relations which most 
sharply distinguishes the sixteenth century from our 
own time is the length to which hostilities could be 
pushed without leading to an open rupture. Continually 
we encounter the phenomena of two powers standing 
with regard to each other in a position that was neither 
peace nor war. ... It was then in foreign affairs a 
recognized proceeding for a sovereign to seek redress 
in one of the various forms of hostility which by the 
consent of international lawyers were regarded as fall- 
ing short of war." 

The incensed condition of the two nations, how- 
ever, at last (in 1584) found vent. The ex- 
pansive force of English commerce, the adven- 
turous and militant spirit of the nation, and 
religious fervor, all combined for the inevitable 
duel. At this moment the Spanish monarchy 
was at its height. The acquisition of Portugal 
by Philip had given him what he had long de- 
sired an Atlantic fleet ; for hitherto, save the 
galleons and frigates of the Indian Guard, the 
Spanish king had no standing navy. More- 
over, the latter, since they were maintained by 
a special tax levied upon those merchants en- 
gaged in traffic, were not legally available for 
the purposes of the Empire. 

In 1584, for the fifth time, Drake sailed on 
a two-years cruise to the Indies, harrying the 
Spanish coast on the way out, and relieving 
Raleigh's Virginia colony on the return. Events 
moved fast with him now. In 1587 he was ac- 
tive in new depredations on the Spanish coasts, 
which he described as " singeing the King of 
Spain's beard." In 1588 English naval prowess 
reached its height in the defeat of the Spanish 
Armada, though Drake did not play the most 
prominent part in those stirring events. Like 
Nelson, Drake was great enough to disobey 
orders at times when his judgment advised. 
This conduct not unnaturally angered his su- 



periors, so that the official dispatches give lit- 
tle light concerning his work in those memo- 
rable channel engagements, though we know 
he was not punished for his independence. 
The truth is, the great Admiral never could 
work successfully under instructions, and the 
red tape of officialdom in 1589, when the Lis- 
bon Expedition was entrusted to him, brought 
him into disgrace. The loss of the Revenge 
in the next year restored him to favor. For 
some years he was employed on Parliamentary 
commissions and on missions, and at last, in 
1596, again found himself in command of a 
squadron. The objective point was Panama 
still a virgin city. But times had changed in 
the twenty years since Drake had reconnoitred 
it from the forest along the Isthmus road, and 
this neither the Queen nor Drake himself ap- 
preciated. 

" In the failure to grasp that Spain had become a 
great sea-power, with a fleet in a constant state of prep- 
aration, and admirals well practised in protecting large 
numbers of ships, lay the fatal misconception that over- 
hung the whole expedition." 

Elizabeth never gave the slightest evidence of 
grasping even the elementary principles of na- 
val warfare, and what England had achieved 
had been in spite of her. Of Drake Mr. Cor- 
bett has something to say in palliation, for, 
with the knowledge at his command, the project 
was sound. The trouble was that he had been 
kept out of touch with the enemy for five years, 
and, moreover, naturally expected to repeat his 
former triumphs. He could only judge by the 
experience of his first great expedition. Mis- 
fortune attended the entire voyage, - at Las 
Palmas, at Guadeloupe, at Porto Rico. From 
present evidence Spannish gunnery has wof ully 
declined since those days, for as the fleet made 
the harbor at Porto Rico, 

" The batteries opened so hot a fire that the surprise 
was on the part of the English, and as the Spanish 
gunners got the range the fire grew deadly. A shot 
got home in the Defiance's mizzen, another crashed 
through her main cabin where Drake and his officers 
were sitting at supper, and with disastrous effect. The 
Admiral had his seat shot from under him ; Sir Nicho- 
las Clifford and Brute Brown, a great favorite of Drake, 
were mortally wounded, and several others more or less 
hurt." 

Worst of all, Drake, in his own words, had 
" hardly any time left to serve God." He was 
ill to death of dysentery, but the brave spirit 
in him would not yet down. Nombre de Dios, 
the scene of his earliest exploits, La Hacha, 
and Santa Marta were successfully attacked, 
as if in amends for earlier disaster. But the 
heaviness increased upon him, and on January

27, 1597, Francis Drake died and was buried 
at sea off the coast of Honduras. 

Yet his work died not with him. Drake 
was more than a daring navigator and a 
prince of corsairs of whom England is half 
ashamed to be proud." It was he whose pre- 
science saw the importance sea-power was to 
have upon his country's history. He was a 
statesman whose thought and achievement has 
made him one of the conscious creators of 
Greater Britain. The British Empire is his 
monument, as it is Olive's and Nelson's and 
Canning's. 

In praising the Admiral, a word in praise 
of his historian must not be withheld. Mr. 
Corbett has done his work so well that it would 
seem no manuscript has been left untouched. 
Black-letter tomes from the Records and Rolls 
Office, the treasures of the British Museum, 
state documents, Spanish, Dutch, and French 
archives, and family papers, all have been 
searched and compared by a practised student. 
The specialist will rejoice in the technical ac- 
count of the development of naval art in the 
sixteenth century, and the initiated will find 
in these two volumes a mass of supplemental 
information upon the politics of the time, its 
statecraft and diplomacy.

A GREAT AMERICAN LAWYER.* 

Circumstances sometimes make men : some- 
times men make circumstances. The man with 
an idea fulfils this latter principle. He sees its 
efficacy, and allows nothing to hinder him. 
Toil and sacrifice, even contempt and antago- 
nism, have no weight. He pushes on to suc- 
cess. He leads human thought, and leaves his 
impress upon human life. 

To say that these words describe the career 
of David Dudley Field would be much easier 
than to give an exact picture of his life's pur- 
pose and achievement. But it was the desire 
to give just such a picture that prompted Mr. 
Field's brother, Dr. Henry M. Field, to write 
the noble biography now presented to us. No 
one could be better fitted for this work, for 
perhaps no one else knew his brother so well ; 
and although the editor speaks of himself as 
" a layman," his lack of technical legal knowl- 
edge is more than compensated by the acquired 
literary skill of many years. His mastery of

the many questions involved, and his under- 
standing of the great lawyer's purpose, indicate 
frequent conferences between the men, and a 
close bond of confidence and affection. 

Before Mr. Field's death in 1894, at the age 
of almost ninety years, he had long been recog- 
nized as one of the greatest men in his profes- 
He loved the law. He had mastered its 



sion. 



principles. He had been eminently successful. 
His practice was large and lucrative. But he 
saw its faults both in expression and practice. 
During the best years of his life he wrought 
for the reformation of the law itself. He be- 
lieved that it should be administered with less 
of process, in order that men might have its 
help with less of delay and at a minimum cost. 

Mr. Field was led to this great object of his 
life by seeing the possible injustice of legal 
proceedings. Even to those outside the profes- 
sion the words ** law and equity " are perfectly 
familiar. We would suppose that the terms 
refer to such laws as shall secure what every- 
one sees to be equitable. But not so. Equity 
may manifestly point one way, while the law 
may be directly opposed to this. Lord Chan- 
cellor Westbury, speaking before the English 
Law Amendment Society, revealed the condi- 
tions when he said that it was " a shame that 
a party could recover a judgment on one side 
of Westminster Hall, and on the other be 
branded as a rogue for having recovered it." 

The more thoroughly he considered " the 
body of common law," and its methods of pro- 
cedure, the more of injustice he beheld. Com- 
mon law ! What is it ? Not, as some suppose, 
those rules founded on the great basal princi- 
ples of justice, commonly held among men as 
universally right. These would certainly win 
and retain our regard. But no, not this. Com- 
mon law is only common usage. It is not a 
compilation of the laws enacted by legislatures, 
but consists of precedents, the decisions of 
judges, some of them wise, some otherwise ; 
some weak, some wicked. Is it any wonder 
that a lover of justice should be dissatisfied 
with such a system? Mr. Field would not 
destroy law because he did not like it, but would 
improve it because he so loved it. And so, 
from 1839, for fifty-five years he devoted him- 
self to this great task. Through his efforts 
the legislature in New York, in 1847, appointed 
a commission, of which he became chairman, to 
present codes of civil and criminal procedure. 
These were completed in 1850, and covered the 
whole ground of remedial law. The work had 
fallen almost entirely on Mr. Field, but such

was his eagerness for the cause that he cheer- 
fully assumed the burdens. 

The successful working of the reform meth- 
ods in New York led other States to adopt 
Mr. Field's codes. And the influence was not 
confined to this continent. English statesmen 
saw the benefits, and immediately sought to 
profit from Mr. Field's work. Then he deter- 
mined to go still farther, even to the reforma- 
tion and codification of the whole body of com- 
mon law ; to throw out what was needless and 
manifestly unjust ; to put desirable decisions 
into simplest and best possible language, and 
to " reduce into a written and systematic code 
the whole body of the law." The New York 
Legislature, in 1857, appointed commissioners 
to perform this work, but allowed no compen- 
sation in any way. "The law was to be made 
so plain that every man could understand it, 
and so obviously just that all should approve 
it." In this work Mr. Field had the partial 
assistance of the other commissioners, but the 
greater part of the work and the expense de- 
volved upon him. Day and night he worked 
with a persistence almost incredible, until, in 
1865, on his sixtieth birthday, the last report 
was made to the legislature. The codes for 
New York had been written. The civil code, 
the penal code, and the political code give the 
substantive law. Two others, the codes of civil 
and of criminal procedure, prescribe the prac- 
tice of the courts and define their jurisdiction. 
Thus, for nearly eighteen years had Mr. Field 
labored, and at last the great work was ready 
for use. 

One would suppose that common sense would 
dictate an immediate adoption of such an im- 
proved formulation of laws and methods. But 
to-day, after thirty-three years, New York State 
has only partially adopted them, not because 
of imperfections, but because there are men 
small enough, and yet with enough of influence, 
to hinder the adoption of codes which would 
simplify the processes of law, and make less 
work for lawyers. 

The task, however, was not in vain. Other 
States have seen the advantages which Mr. 
Field's own State has neglected ; so that, at the 
present time, it is estimated that forty millions 
of American citizens are enjoying the help 
which Mr. Field's work made possible. En- 
gland also has been helped. English colonies 
the world over have incorporated these reforms. 
While travelling in India he was surprised to 
find courts of law working under rules which 
he had written, word for word, in his library 



in New York City. And even in Singapore 
and Hongkong he saw justice administered 
according to statutes which he had worded. 

A still larger conception presented itself to 
him. It was nothing less than the codification 
of international laws. His interests were 
world-wide. In his travels in every land he had 
become intimately acquainted with the states- 
men of the world. In this new undertaking he 
found an interest already existing, but no one 
ready to assume the task. He had already 
reached an age when most men plan to make 
their work easier ; but with a great thought 
before him, and with the encouragement of the 
world's legal thinkers, he began a work so vast 
that even with skilled assistance it required 
seven years of unremitting toil before he could 
produce his " Draft of Outlines of International 
Law." It was not a final statement, for he felt 
that International Law was progressive ; but it 
was a good foundation, and strengthened an 
international sentiment. 

Mr. Field was interested in all public mat- 
ters, wherever men live. The previously un- 
written history of Lincoln's first nomination 
shows Mr. Field as a power among ambitious 
and contending forces, and tells us who really 
gave us our great War President. His partici- 
pation and leadership in the peace parliaments 
in different lands reveal his influence and his 
purpose. Only once did Mr. Field hold public 
office, and then for only two months, to fill an 
unexpired term in Congress, while the Electoral 
Commission was at work in 1876. At no time 
did he occupy the Judge's bench ; such honors 
he left for others, while he devoted himself to 
his chosen task of the revision and classification 
of the laws. 

This is but a part of the record which Dr. 
Field has given of his distinguished brother's 
career. Such a life-story, told in such a way, 
should be of interest, not only to members of 
the bar, but to thinking men and women in 
every walk of life. HARRY W. REED. 



THE following extract is from a letter recently written 
by Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz to Mr. Curtin, his English 
translator : " I receive a multitude of letters from 
America. In a few weeks upward of two hundred and 
seventy have come to me, and eight or ten new ones 
arrive every day. These letters are so many in num- 
ber that in view of my work and family afflictions I 
have been unable to answer them. I shall send replies 
to all those letters, but not till I have finished ' The 
Knights of the Cross.' That work done, I shall take up 
at once the letters sent me from America, for that coun- 
try and the people who are masters of it are to me truly 
and profoundly sympathetic."

LESSONS IN THE ART OF WAK.* 

" Letters on Strategy," by Prince Kraft zu 
Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, is published in the En- 
glish " Wolseley Series " of military books. The 
work is translated into straightforward, idio- 
matic, military English ; the editor is Captain 
Walter H. James of the English army. It is 
in two volumes which are excellently printed, 
and the elaborate maps and plans are carefully 
drawn. 

The letters do not treat of abstract rules of 
strategy, but deduce their lessons from actual 
campaigns. The campaigns considered are the 
Napoleonic campaign of 1806 against the Prus- 
sians, which ended in the battle of Jena ; the 
campaign of 1859 in Italy, in which the last 
Napoleon fought the Austrians under Gyulai ; 
and the campaigns of the Franco-Prussian War 
in 1870. 

As the reader interested in military studies 
knows, the late Prince Kraft was the author of 
several highly valued works on military sub- 
jects. Among our own army men his Con- 
versations on Cavalry " is held in high esteem. 
Captain James says of Prince Kraft : 

" He was not only known as one of Prussia's ablest 
soldiers, but also as one of the best of German military 
authors. During the wars of 1866 and 1870 he com- 
manded the artillery of the Guard (an army corps of 
three divisions), and in the latter part of the Franco- 
Prussian war he directed the artillery operations against 
Paris." 

So much for an introduction to a work which 
needs nothing more than an introduction. The 
present reviewer has given these " Letters on 
Strategy " great attention, and it seems to him 
that there is no other work with which he is 
acquainted, however great the military genius 
of its author, that will set the student better in 
the way of learning the art of strategy. Prince 
Kraft studied the art of war under the old 
masters ; he lived his life in the army ; he had 
vast experience in war ; evidently his mind was 
absorbed in his profession, and certainly he 
was a gallant soldier. He knew the dangers of 
war, and liked them for the honor there was in 
braving them. Fortunately, so good a soldier 
possessed also the rare art of the teacher. No 
technical book could be more pleasantly written. 

In the first place, Prince Kraft does away 
with abstractions, and with the numbered rules 
and their unnumbered exceptions which, he 
says, used to put him to sleep when he was a

student. He does not believe in learning the 
dry formulas and rules of the books which, 
after all, teach one very little about war and 
only give him a distaste for the subject. But 
having discarded the learning of the books, he 
does not delight the student by saying that 
there is little left to learn : on the contrary, he 
says that only the study and the experience of 
years will make a fair general officer, or an 
efficient staff officer. Prince Kraft shows that 
the knowledge which largely goes to make the 
strategist is the knowledge of almost countless 
details. Napoleon excelled in this sort of knowl- 
edge. Genius without the knowledge of these 
details would be helpless. 

Certainly Germany, which called itself " The 
Nation in Arms," has gone a long way towards 
discovering what are the secrets of military 
success. The best energies of its best men have 
been given to the study of this question. In 
this important time in our own country, when 
every day witnesses the appointment of civil- 
ians and other inexperienced men to staff posi- 
tions in our army, I cannot forbear quoting 
what one of the best of these German authori- 
ties says as to the necessary technical knowl- 
edge of the staff officer : 

* A good strategist requires a vast amount of knowl- 
edge. Not only must he be acquainted with the organ- 
ization of his own and foreign armies, he must be 
thoroughly up in the proper mode of issuing orders, 
instructions, and march tables: he must know all about 
marches, camping, cantonments and bivouacs, lines of 
communication and supplies, besides what is wanted 
with regard to weapons, ammunition, and clothing. He 
must be able to make military sketches and to recon- 
noitre, be well posted in all matters concerning fortifi- 
cations and fighting, understand the management of 
telegraphs and railways, and the transport of the 
wounded. He must be well acquainted with statistics, 
so as to know the capabilities of a country, and the num- 
ber of troops it can maintain, and should be sufficiently 
well up in civil administration to be able to rule a con- 
quered country until the regular civil officials can take 
over this duty. He must be able to judge the carrying 
capacity of a railroad and appraise the power of resist- 
ance of a fortress, having regard to its position, con- 
struction, and garrison." 

In the present war our national existence is 
not at stake, to be sure, and we shall be vic- 
torious whoever are our staff officers ; but if 
our country is not at stake, the lives of our 
countrymen are, and certainly when our coun- 
trymen go out to fight and risk their lives for 
us we should not, by the appointment of ineffi- 
cient staff officers, make their fight any harder 
or their risk any greater. On every page of 
these two volumes by Prince Kraft he shows 
how good or evil came from the work of the

staff. Anyone reading these volumes will hope 
that before another war, before another cam- 
paign in this war, army appointments may be 
forever cut loose from politics and favoritism, 
and that the appointing power may appreciate 
its serious duty its duty as serious as life 
and death, its duty which is bound up with its 
honor to appoint over our brave soldiers the 
best military men that the country affords. 

A very instructive matter that Prince Kraft 
notices in every war he writes of is the influence 
of politics. In each war, politics was, on one 
side or the other, a cause of disaster. It is only 
by sheer luck that popular demand as to mili- 
tary movements is not wrong. In 1870 Mc- 
Mahon was driven by the Paris newspapers and 
the Chamber of Deputies to take a step contrary 
to military reason. It was a step bound to fail. 
It ended in the battle of Sedan. 

Prince Kraft was a firm disbeliever in coun- 
cils of war. He believed that these councils were 
bad in every way. In the campaign of 1806, 
the combined plan of all the generals was worse 
than the poorest plan proposed by any of them. 

To show the perfection to which the German 
commissary department attained, the author 
states that during the great war he recalls only 
two days when the men did not have proper 
rations. Those were the days of the battles of 
St. Privat and Sedan. There is no reason why 
we cannot do as well. 

If these books could be widely read they 
would do much towards teaching what are the 
duties of soldiers, officers, generals, legislatures, 
newspapers, and cabinets in war, and in pre- 
paring for war. ^^ _,

MEDIAEVAL, LAW AND POLITICS.* 

A more inclusive title than that Mr. Jenks 
has chosen for his " Law and Politics in the 
Middle Ages " would be difficult to find. Yet 
such a careful study of the book as its merit 
warrants will prove the exactitude of the title. 
The work is not, however, a complete history 
of mediaeval times, which is fairly implied in 
words so comprehensive as law and politics 
this would be to assign to them a quantitative, 
when they are to be taken in a qualitative 
sense ; but rather an inquiry into the origins 
and natures of the laws and politics of Western 
Europe between the break-up of Roman and

the establishment of modern methods of legis- 
lation and government. 

In the late Professor von Ihering's " The 
Evolution of the Aryan," an admirable exam- 
ple of close argument from historic law to pre- 
historic custom is to be had, wherein seemingly 
inexplicable matters in the lex scripta are at 
last compelled to unfold themselves in a pan- 
orama, dimly lighted but not indistinct, of 
national happenings in the days of demigods. 
This monumental work is the evolution of the 
Aryan in a double sense : it is the latest pro- 
duct in the process of evolution of the methods 
made most familiar to us through the writings 
of Sir Henry Maine. Mr. Jenks has not pro- 
gressed so far, nor are his pretensions so great. 
There is nothing in his ratiocination which 
makes us involuntarily exclaim in admiration, 
as in the elder work. He is more cautious, and 
does not find it needful to pass some of his 
topics on the run, as it were, in his haste to 
illumine a vast area with facts which at best 
are dim. If he is less clever, he is still original ; 
though his work is only one of many, filling a 
necessary place with credit if not with distinc- 
tion a step towards the goal, if not the goal 
itself. It may be that no one will ever do more 
than round out von Ihering's work where his 
lamented death left it confessedly incomplete ; 
it is a certainty that Mr. Jenks's study will find 
some of its conclusions embodied in some mas- 
terly consideration of the question of the ob- 
scuration of his own place as an investigator. 
" It aims to deal only with conduct, not with 
speculation ; with action, not with thought," he 
says of his work. " It should be further con- 
fessed that the book makes no pretence of 
severe scholarship," he adds. We hasten to 
supplement these explanations with comment of 
our own : it leaves established in a manner both 
clear and comprehensive the simple thesis which 
he sets out to demonstrate, " that law, at any 
rate in the Middle Ages, is not the arbitrary 
command of authority, but something entirely 
different." 

Palpably, this is a flight in the face of Aus- 
tinian dogma. In Germany, where the multi- 
plicity of special students in all fields of thought 
leave conflicting theories in nearly all of them, 
a clash of authorities from which the final 
spark of truth is to leap, it is a comparatively 
light matter to dispute the conclusions of any 
thinker, however profound sometimes it is a 
mere question of marshalling the appropriate 
monographs on the subject in opposition. In 
England, where the national love for precedent 



72

and authority is frequently overwhelming, the 
skilful limitation of Professor Austin's famous 
definition is to be imputed to Mr. Jenks both 
for courage and zeal for truth. Yet his rea- 
soning, always cogent, is by no means startling 
in either premises or conclusion. The Austin ian 
theory, that " law is a command of the State," 
is found to fit affairs very well indeed when in 
that condition we call final " because our own 
notions have not advanced beyond it. But it 
fails us when we inquire into the beginnings of 
things. Something even more remote than 
Blaokstone's definition of custom is implied, 
and here is to be sought the seed of the lex non 
scripta. Mr. Jenks brings this out clearly. 
The law, national, and the politics, interna- 
tional, are shown by him to be matters not of 
command but of determination. Given a state- 
ment of facts, and there was always a condition 
of law to meet it, crude and plastic it may be, 
but still enough to limit the labors of courts, 
councillors, and kings to ascertaining and re- 
cording it they do nothing more than mint 
the gold they mine, leaving its value unchanged 
though more readily ascertainable. 

To follow Mr. Jenks into details, especially 
in his vivid presentment of the contractual idea 
hi its later developments, is to fail to interest 
the general reader, though his conclusions are 
important to the special student. To the latter 
it may indeed be highly commended, not least 
because it serves to show how assured a place 
is held by the administration of justice in 
English-speaking lands, its roots being deeply 
planted in the very genius of the people evolved 
by long habitudes, its trunk being an orderly 
and regular progression, free during many cen- 
turies from arbitrary disturbance, its branches 
flourishing in an atmosphere of slow but effi- 
cient adaptability. That the ripened product 
of such a growth should be rather the holy 
fear of injustice than a desire to measure out 
exact retribution, is the crowning glory of it 
all though Mr. Jenks does not say so.

GUESSES AT THE RIDDLES OF SOCIETY.* 

Mr. J. H. W. Stnckenberg, the author of an In- 
troduction to the Study of Sociology," declares bis 
purpose to be " to lay tbe basis for sociological study, 
to designate the problems involved, and to aid the 
beginner in tbe solution of these problems." His 
book is designed for use among professional men, 
private students, and classes in educational institu- 
tions. The first chapter is devoted to the " genesis 
of the idea of society," the various attempts to found 
a science of sociology. After Comte, only a few 
works are mentioned, and these very briefly. Then 
follows a discussion of the definition and scope of 
sociology. The subject-matter of sociology is every 
kind of human association, tbe association energies, 
what associates men, what creates society, and the 
results of association. Excluded from sociological 
study are metaphysical problems, as materialism and 
spiritualism ; biology ; the theory of evolution ; psy- 
chology, save as an instrument of research ; theology. 
A protest is entered against attempting to expand 
economics or politics over the field of sociology : 
" in one case society is reduced to industrialism ; and 
in tbe other, to a political institution." Theoretically 
and practically, both tendencies are pernicious, and 
lead to intellectual bias and to actual injury. " By 
grouping the various disciplines which pertain to 
humanity, we at best get only separate sciences of 
certain human factors, as economics and politics ; 
but this leaves society itself without a science." 

In the " Principles of Society " we are asked to 
consider " all that must be in order that society may 
be." The author declares that " every effort to 
interpret society as composed of individuals has 
proved a signal failure. Yet that is the universal 
conception of society. . . . Strictly speaking, indi- 
viduals are aggregated, never associated." He ad- 
mits that this is a private and original judgment, 
and that the dictionaries are against him. Perhaps 
bondage to traditional and customary modes of think- 
ing of society as composed of real people, makes one 
obtuse ; but the sentence quoted will be a hard say- 
ing to many, and the author struggles all through 
the book to explain and enforce his idea. Society 
is said, further, not to consist of individuals in their 
totality, but only so much of each individual as 
actually enters society (pages 118, 119 ). What tbe 
members of a society have in common, the purpose 
of the association, what they share, constitutes the 
association. This conception of a part of a person 
joining a club and leaving the major part of his

substance elsewhere, or locked in the secret abysses 
of his inner consciousness, will stagger some begin- 
ners. The proper materials of sociology are not 
men, but "social energies." Money (p. 124) is 
called a social force. 

The author introduces the word " Sociation " to 
designate those personal forces which interact be- 
tween men, what men share, what associates. He 
claims that all men have reserves which are never 
drawn into this union, never form a part of the 
essence of society. " The beginner may find it dif- 
ficult to treat society as a system of forces ; but 
practice will overcome the difficulty, and he will 
soon wonder how he could ever imagine that society 
consisted of individuals as totalities, instead of the 
social energies of individuals " (p. 136). The author 
himself seems to find it difficult to do what he pre- 
scribes for beginners, for he says (p. 245) : " Hit- 
man beings really associated, whether consciously 
or not, that is th* fundamental concept of society." 
And again (p. 247) : " Men with their attachments 
are the social factors in which the social energies 
inhere." Under the title " Historical Evolution " 
the various social forces are enumerated and their 
functions defined, but there is very scant unfolding 
of the laws of the process. There is a long criticism 
of Mr. Spencer's formulas. " Sociological Ethics " 
deals with the ends of society and the means of 
realizing them. " Social ethics purposes to give a 
system of social morality ; in sociological ethics we 
aim to give the principles of social progress " 
(p. 208) . Very brief treatment is given to the social 
ideal, and to the means of progress. 

The teacher will be interested in the author's 
method in the study of sociology. This method con- 
sists in the discovery of the principles, of the evolu- 
tion of social energies, and of the ideals and means 
of progress. A brief bibliography is supplied, and 
at the close a plan for the study of a community is 
furnished. The author has read widely, travelled 
far, lived long in Europe, and gives to his readers 
many suggestions drawn from reflection and obser- 
vation. The trained student may read the book with 
real hope of stimulation and of gaining new points 
of view. The vision of life is lofty, ethical, and 
spiritual. But the book is not for beginners, and 
the contributions offered to the discussion are open 
to severe criticism. There is no attempt to throw 
light on current and concrete problems, or to attain 
general laws. The recommendations of books heap 
titles together without clear discrimination, the 
powerful masterpieces being classed with very infer- 
ior works, with no hint of the vast difference between 
them. It is questionable whether the pedagogic 
method is at all suitable for young students ; and in 
this respect most teachers will feel that the last 
chapter should be first and much enlarged. The 
teacher should be familiar with the subjects of the 
earlier chapters, but the pupil should start with the 
last subject mentioned, with the plan of a commu- 
nity or with definite problems or situations which 
will at once engage his voluntary attention. 



Clearness, downright honesty, and straightfor- 
ward purpose to report the mind of the writer, char- 
acterize the " Outlines of Sociology," by Dr. Lester 
F. Ward. The discussion is not adapted to juvenile 
minds, but it should be clear to any mature student 
who has had a good college course and some first- 
hand acquaintance with scientific modes of thought. 
The classification of the sciences offered by Comte 
is accepted, with explanations, as substantially valid, 
astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and soci- 
ology. A distinct place should be given to psychol- 
ogy immediately next to sociology. A place is given 
to political economy as a branch of sociology, sub- 
stantially as defined by John Stuart Mill, one of the 
greatest economists, who said of his special subject : 
" It does not treat of the whole of man's nature as 
modified by the social state, nor of the whole conduct 
of man in society. It is concerned with him solely as 
a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is ca- 
pable of judging of the comparative efficacy of 
means of obtaining that end." Mill formulated 
the essential problems of sociology before Comte 
invented the now accepted title of the discipline. 
Sociology does not rest directly, but only indirectly, 
on biology. The analogies of Mr. Spencer are crit- 
icized, and a true " homology " is found by compar- 
ing the nervous system with the central organi- 
zation of society. Anthropology has for its task the 
study of the concrete facts of human nature and 
man's works ; it is a branch of zoology in which 
man is the subject studied. Sociology employs the 
data furnished by anthropology in its investigation 
of the laws of association. Man was not at first a 
social being, and is not entirely socialized yet. So- 
ciety is an artificial acquisition, while animal asso- 
ciation is instinctive and natural. 

The relation of sociology to psychology is most 
important to study. Psychology embraces the en- 
tire field of psychic phenomena, which are divided 
by the author into sense and intellect, the word 
sense being synonymous with feeling in general. 
The will is the active expression of the feelings. 
Intellect is simply a means to the end ; the end is 
the good ; and the good " is nothing else than agree- 
able sensation." The ethical end is " to secure the 
maximum of absolute enjoyment." The problem of 
ethics is " to secure the greatest pleasure. . . . The 
relative worthiness of pleasure is, therefore, ulti- 
mately based on the quantity of pleasure yielded. 
It is this and nothing else that is meant when virtue 
is enjoined and vice condemned" (pp. 100101). 
The author is frankly a Hedonist. Not only T. H. 
Green and all the Kantians and idealists, but even 
Shelley, are set down as victims of mere mysticism. 
These lines of Shelley would be repudiated : 

" Were it virtue's only need to dwell 
In a celestial palace, all resigned 
To pleasurable impulses, immured 
Within the prison of itself, the will 
Of changeless Nature would be unfulfilled. 
Learn to make others happy. Spirit, come ! 
This is thine high reward." 

The author places intellectual pleasures above 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



those of altruism (p. 104). The object of Nature 
is function ; the object of man is happiness ; the 
object of society is effort. The result of all is evo- 
lution. The data of sociology are the principles 
of the subordinate sciences, "the broad princi- 
ples that underlie and govern all departments of 
natural phenomena." Sociology is the synthesis of 
the other sciences, and is a university study for ad- 
vanced students. The social forces are the desire* 
which lead to acts of reproduction, self-preservation, 
and satisfaction of the esthetic and intellectual 
nature. The social mechanism means the social 
order, and social statics is its science. Progress im- 
plies the modification of structure and of environ- 
ment. It is genetic or telic ; that is, natural" and 
without purpose, or artificial and the result of a con- 
scions plan. Intentional modifications are individ- 
ual or collective ; and this last mode of progress is 
a late arrival, as yet only in its beginnings. The 
future form of society promises to be not individ- 
ualism nor socialism, but " sociocracy." Sociocracy 
recognizes natural inequalities, and aims to abolish 
artificial inequalities ; it seeks to substitute the inter- 
est of all for the dominance of a few ; it would con- 
fer benefits in strict proportion to merit, but insists 
upon equality of opportunity. Natural selection 
does not secure the survival of the fittest, as is pop- 
ularly supposed, but only of those who are adapted 
to an inferior environment. Sociocracy will improve 
the environment, and so produce better natures. 

Mr. Mallock is a smart writer. In " Aristocracy 
and Evolution " he appears at his best in full 
dress. It is charming to see him writing down the 
socialists, while he holds up to scorn their arch 
enemy, Mr. Herbert Spencer. Mr. Mallock has 
made a wonderful discovery in sociology : he has 
found out that brains and blood will tell, and that 
the most rapid runners get first to the goal. The 
socialists are stupid fellows for denying this epoch- 
making truth, and no sociologist has ever recognized 
it. We have, to quote Mr. L. F. Ward, been tread- 
ing on the keys of the universe without knowing it. 
The great man " is the world's creditor ; let us 
take off our hats to him as he drives by or over us ! 
To be sure, this " great man " may be neither un- 
usually intelligent nor good ; greatness " need not 
necessarily imply any moral, nor indeed any intel- 
lectual, superiority " (p. 336). After pruning away 
several other desirable qualities, the title " Magnus " 
seems of doubtful propriety. Carlyle did not say 
" general " but only " captain " of industry. The 
Business Manager, albeit he is represented as a crea- 
ture who will serve the world only for plenty of hard 
cash, is glorified as the leader of progress. Incur- 
able Philistinism is deified. Plutocracy is crowned. 

To be sure, the essential idea, that the inventor is 
an exceptional man and the social leader, had been 
worked out by Tarde, Guyau, Giddings, and other 
sociologists ; but Mr. Mallock is innocent of knowl- 
edge of these thinkers ; at least he does not mention 
them. He is well acquainted with some striking 



j>:i.s:it,'et< in Mr. Benjamin Kidd. but SrliiilHe. whone 
44 authorities " resemble Mr. Mallock's 44 great men," 
is not on the list. This childlike displacement of 
M. Tarde by Mr. Kidd is quite interesting to stu- 
dents of sociology. It is this ignorance of the lit- 
erature of sociology which permits the author to 
say that the whole school of contemporary soci- 
ologists, with Mr. Spencer as their head, absolutely 
refuse to take any account whatever of the congen- 
ital inequalities by which individuals within the 
same aggregate are differentiated." 

Mr. Mallock is a bright man and a delightful 
essayist, even when he is largely ignorant of his 
subject. I have said " ignorant " because it would 
be unpleasant to suggest the alternative. If he really 
is acquainted with M. Tarde or Professor Giddings, 
and their recognition of invention in relation to so- 
cial progress, we should have to charge him with 
moral obliquity or misrepresentation ; and we prefer 
not to choose that form of statement. Mr. Mallock 
has presented, in vigorous, clear English, one of the 
keenest and most incisive attacks on communistic 
theories yet published. The notion that animal 
labor is the sole source of wealth, which is not at 
all complimentary to wage-workers, is shown to be 
essentially false, and that is a good service to all 
classes of producers. 

The conservative and individualist speaks in Mr. 
Mackay's book on " The State and Charity." There 
is rather too much unconscious assumption of pre- 
mises, as in the assertion so quietly introduced 
(p. 6) that under a system of entire freedom labor 
would find a ready market Unquestionably the 
writer has found the weak places in the administra- 
tion of public relief, and the criticisms fall even 
more heavily on American methods than on those 
of England. Some parts of the book contribute 
important and suggestive interpretations of the ten- 
dencies of thought in relation to endowed charities. 
The reader should compare this with another book 
in the same series u The Poor Law," by T. W. 
Fowle in order to appreciate the particular phase 
of the subject here discussed, and to give a more 
complete view of the field of public relief. This 
work will belong in the library of every student of 
charity. 

" The Twentieth Century City " is a title which 
suggests the prophet ; and it is with earnest, solemn, 
insistent speech that the devoted author urges the 
need for religious patriotism. He dwells upon the 
materialism of modern civilization, and illustrates 
the idea that the city reveals the character of the 
age in its most pronounced form. He repeats the 
story of the tendency of population to urban life, 
and shows that the causes of this tendency are last- 
ing. Moral growth, be believes, has not kept pace 
with the commercial and industrial advance, and 
the city has become a menace to itself, and to the 
state and nation. The remedy lies in religious pa- 
triotism, in the diffusion of higher social ideals, in 
a new form of church activity. The churches must

save society, or must themselves perish. The par- 
ticular measures which the author urges are a sort 
of referendum backed by an organized movement 
of young people's societies to distribute patriotic and 
instructive tracts. While there is large room for 
doubt as to whether or not the means proposed 
would be at all adequate, there can be no question 
that there is a neglected duty to be taken up, and 
the author has given an eloquent voice to the call 
of the nation for the highest form of educational 
work in the obligations of citizenship.

nothing more than a novelette of the sketchiest sort, 
and leaves us at the end in doubt concerning the 
outcome. It is the story of the exiled king of an 
imaginary realm of Messina, who trades upon the 
loyalty of his following to plan an expedition for 
the recovery of his throne, and who secretly betrays 
his own cause for a subsidy. The action takes place 
at Tangier, and the motley types of adventurers 
who are grouped about the king are sketched in an 
incisive way, but not characterized in any real sense. 
The story is clever and entertaining, but the author 
himself could not expect us to take it very seriously. 

The matter-of-fact and the whimsical are the 
distinctive elements in Mr. Stockton's writing 
except when he is unhappily tempted to mix him- 
self up with sea-fights and pirate treasures, and 
both are evident enough in " The Girl at Cobhurst." 
If we may venture upon so fine a distinction, it is 
proper to say that matter-of-fact gets the better of 
whimsy in this story, and becomes deliciously droll 
by virtue of its very bareness. The book also pre- 
sents us with some quite tolerable charactered rawing, 
subject to the limitations of the author's method, 
and possesses considerable interest as a quiet narra- 
tive of life in a country town. 

" She wanted her Individuality back ; that was 
the long and the short of it." In this brief quota- 
tion from Mrs. Atherton's new novel the work is 
neatly epitomized in more ways than one. For we 
find in these few words not only a statement of the 
theme, but also, in the capitalization of the principal 
noun, the false placing of emphasis that character- 
izes the entire work, and in the unlucky choice of 
phrase, the essential commonness of the style in 
which the book is written. The latter criticism, 
indeed, might safely be made from the title alone. 
" American Wives and English Husbands " would 
do for a sociological treatise, or for an essay in 
" The Spectator "; as the name of a novel it is sim- 
ply impossible. The story deals, moreover, almost 
wholly with one English husband and his American 
wife, while the latter is not a wife at all until we 
are midway in the narrative. Possibly, however, 
there are more Anglo-American couples to follow in 
later volumes, for, although no promises are made, 
the story is by no means cleared up, and we cannot 
think it Mrs. Atherton's intention to leave us in the 
dark concerning the manner in which the heroine 
gets " her Individuality back." In this restless 
chafing for freedom, she reminds us of the heroine 
of Mr. Herrick's recent novel, and a superficial 
view might discover several points of similarity be- 
tween the books which these two women respec- 
tively dominate. But a closer view would disclose 
contrasts much more marked than these resem- 
blances, for the ideals of " American Wives and 
English Husbands " are as low as those of " The 
Gospel of Freedom " are high, and while Mr. 
Herrick's heroine is moulded of such fine clay that 
she is attractive even when at fault, Mrs. Atherton's 
heroine is so badly spoiled by her training and en- 
vironment that she commands little sympathy in the

crisis of her fortunes. The book is in some respects 
brilliant, and displays much shrewd first-hand ob- 
servation, but there is a streak of vulgarity running 
through it. and it moves upon a low moral plane. 

" In Kings' Houses," Mrs. Dorr's story of the 
days of Queen Anne, is a pretty story of the senti- 
mental sort, extremely mild in interest, but display- 
ing a close and even affectionate familiarity with 
the history and customs of its period. The Queen 
becomes a more gracious figure in Mrs. Dorr's pages 
than she appears in most books, and is the only 
historical personage whom the author attempts to 
characterize seriously. Others flit across the scene, 
but make no impression, unless we call a historical 
personage the young Duke of Gloster, her son, 
whose early death destroyed the last real hope of 
the Stuarts. Rather more than half of the book, in 
fact, is given to the boyhood of this interesting lad, 
and the last years of the great King and statesman 
who made secure for all time the liberties of the 
English people. 

Mr. Clinton Ross has sought pastures new for 
his latest excursions in romance. A Trooper of 
the Empress " is a tale of South Africa, and tells 
how a great territory was saved for England by the 
energetic daring of a more fortunate Dr. Jameson. 
Bobbie McDuff " is a tale of gypsies and Russian 
princes and medieval strongholds, and tells us how 
the son of a great house learned of his origin, and 
came to his own after the most surprising and peri- 
lous adventures. Both of these books are interest- 
ing, in spite of their jerkiness of manner, and their 
trick of reducing a scene to its bare elements, leav- 
ing the reader's imagination to supply all the needed 
details. 

When a sequel to some successful work of fiction 
is promised, it is customary for sapient people to 
shake their heads, make irrelevant remarks about 
" Don Quijote" and " Wilhelm Meister " and " Tar- 
tarin," and prophesy a more or less dismal failure. 
These famous books illustrate, no doubt, the truth 
that genius rarely reproduces or revivifies its hap- 
piest inspirations, but to argue from this that the 
popular novelist may not transfer his characters from 
one book to another, and still another if he wish, 
with effect as pleasing as when they were first intro- 
duced to the public, is to employ a mistaken analogy. 
To make " The Prisoner of Zenda," for example, 
the text of such an argument, is to take that enter- 
taining book much too seriously. For our part, we 
have no doubt that " Anthony Hope " could write 
" Zenda " stories by the dozen, without any weak- 
ening of interest, for the charm of these stories is 
in their invention alone, and invention has little or 
nothing to do with works of genius. Our chief regret, 
then, in reading Rupert of Hentzau," is that the 
principal characters are all killed, thus making fur- 
ther volumes in the series at least improbable. The 
new romance is quite as good as its predecessor, filled 
quite as full of ingeniously planned situations and 
dramatic effects. We are bound to say, however, 
that the wanton slaying of the hero strikes a dis- 



cordant note. He was doubtless in a fix, and the 
author was in an equally obvious one. But the note 
of comedy is the fundamental note of the whole 
performance, and its abrupt displacement by the 
note of tragedy produces a shock. If the writer 
had been wholly consistent, he would have made the 
hero take his own life in satisfaction of his some- 
what strained ideal of honorable conduct, instead of 
having him taken off by what is hardly more than 
an accident. This would have been tragic also, but 
not so perverse as the solution actually devised. And 
few readers would have felt any real scruples in 
accepting him henceforth as the husband of Flavia 
and the King of Ruritania. As for his pretty epi- 
taph, we need not have lost even that, for it would 
have served quite as well after ten or twenty years 
of beneficent rule and conjugal happiness. The 
populace deserved the one, and Flavia was entitled 
to the other. 

Kronstadt " is a sufficiently thrilling tale to war- 
rant our approval, although the approval must be 
somewhat closely qualified. As a serious social 
study, it is naught ; as an entertaining narrative of 
adventure, with the guardian fortress of the Russian 
Empire for a stage-setting, and for a background the 
vast and mysterious despotism of the Tsar, it is dis- 
tinctly successful. How an Englishwoman spied 
upon the fortifications and sold their secrets to the 
English government, how she won the love of a 
Russian officer, and made him forget his duty in 
fleeing with her after the discovery of her treachery, 
and how all their troubles came to a happy ending, 
is what Mr. Pemberton has told us in this charming 
story, and his art is most apparent in the fact that 
both the man and the woman keep their hold upon 
our sympathies in spite of conduct which, calmly 
considered, is reprehensible. The escape from 
Kronstadt in a small boat is particularly well man- 
aged, and although agony is piled upon agony, the 
line of sensationalism does not seem to be overpassed. 
There are also some capital pages of descriptive 
writing in the book, description that is forcible, 
vivid, and yet restrained. 

The wars of the sixteenth century in the Nether- 
lands, and, more specifically, the siege of Leyden, 
constitute the theme of Sons of Adversity," a new 
romance by Mr. L. Cope Cornford, whose " Master- 
Beggars" we had the pleasure of commending a 
year or more ago. We now have another story of 
much the same sort, a story of political intrigue, 
hazardous adventure, and successful love. It does 
not speak well for the author's accuracy to find, on 
the first page, such a phrase as " the year of our 
Lord 1574. being the fifteenth year of the glorious 
reign of Elizabeth," but the story is none the less 
interesting for a few such slips. 

Novels in which music is the element of chief 
interest are apt to overflow into sentimentality, and 
" The Duenna of a Genius " is no exception to the 
rule. The chapters of Mrs. Blundell's story are all 
provided with phrases borrowed from the Italianate 
vocabulary of the art musical, and the changes are 



1898.]

rung by means of such terms as " staccato," " con 
tristezza," " appassionato subito," and " sempre 
crescendo." The " finale con molto sentimento " not 
only describes the closing chapter, but the greater 
number of the others as well. Still, the story is 
pretty enough, although its characterization is ex- 
tremely superficial, and its dramatic substance of 
the thinnest possible consistency. 

There is something less of the sentimental strain 
in " The Concert- Director," and something more of 
successful representation of character. The story 
is ingeniously planned, and tells how an unscrupu- 
lous adventurer sought the love of a famous singer 
to secure for himself the rank and emoluments of 
a concert-manager. He is more successful than he 
expected to be, and finds that he really loves her 
into the bargain. She, for her part, tires of him 
when she learns of his insincerity, and seeks for 
happiness elsewhere. The story deals with musi- 
cians and musical commercialism throughout, and 
shows close acquaintance with the types of character 
that are developed by the concert-hall and the oper- 
atic stage. 

The third musical novel on our list is much better 
than the other two ; first, because it is not so effu- 
sively sentimental, and second, because it has a well- 
constructed and almost original plot. Here, the 
chief character is a man of fine temper who marries 
a singer of shallow nature, because he has given a 
promise to his friend, her brother, who exacted it 
upon his death-bed. Granting this somewhat ques- 
tionable point of honor, the after-events follow as 
natural consequences ; for to keep his promise the 
hero sacrifices the woman whom he loves, and makes 
her life as well as his own one great renunciation. 
The wife proves unworthy of him, although she 
stops short of actually sinning against him, and 
makes an escapade which comes near to resulting 
seriously, and which supplies material for the sub- 
stance of the plot. The haunting strain of one of the 
immortal melodies of the world " Che faro senza 
Eurydice " runs through the novel, and acquires 
a symbolical significance from the relations into 
which the characters fall. It is even introduced in 
musical notation over and over again, and provides a 
leit-motiv for the action. The book is nowise strong, 
but it is distinctly readable and interesting. 

The fourth of our musical novels, and the last to 
be considered, has nothing in common with the other 
three, being the work of a master and not of an 
amateur. Mr. George Moore has had a somewhat 
chequered career as a novelist, and his books have 
deeply stirred the waters of discussion upon more 
than one occasion. Their power has always been 
undeniable, and they have shown a fine instinct for 
the best models of style and composition, but their 
subjects and manner of treatment have at times 
displayed a questionable morality and a conspicuous 
lack of delicacy. The tradition which for so long 
kept English fiction from sounding the deeps of life 
in its passionate aspects affected Mr. Moore like a 
red rag, and his reaction against the convention- 



alities more than once resulted in sending him to 
the extreme of boldness and outspoken utterance. 
In " Evelyn Innes " he has produced a work that 
must be taken seriously, whatever one may think of 
its purport. It is a strong and penetrating portrayal 
of modern life, written with both mastery and knowl- 
edge. We always hesitate to pronounce a book im- 
moral in tendency simply because some of its char- 
acters lead immoral lives. So superficial a view as 
that has no place in serious criticism, because the 
real problem is so much deeper. We do not need 
to approve of Evelyn's conduct in calling her history 
an essentially moral one. She is simply a woman 
of weak will, in whose temperament the artistic ele- 
ment outweighs for a time the sense for conduct, 
and leads her into a course that is no doubt shock- 
ing, but that is at the same time inevitable, given 
her character to begin with. It is equally inevit- 
able that her conscience should become awakened 
in the end, and by precisely the means that are here 
employed, and the renunciation of her sinful rela- 
tions with the two men who love her, and the sin- 
cerity of her atonement, seem to adjust the ethical 
balance of the work. The end of it all is not made 
quite clear, but Evelyn is left in the path of spiritual 
purification, and it seems that the author would have 
us believe that her steps are not to be retraced, but 
are to carry her, however painfully, along the nar- 
rower and better way that she has chosen. We have 
said nothing as yet of the musical part of the story. 
In brief, Evelyn is the daughter of a man whose 
whole life is devoted to a restoration of church 
music to the austere simplicity and beauty of the 
early centuries. The cult of Palestrina fills all her 
early life, yet she herself becomes a great dramatic 
singer and an interpreter of the characters created 
by the genius of Wagner. The story of her career 
introduces much musical criticism, and the author's 
analysis of the great Wagnerian dramas is extra- 
ordinarily acute and subtle. Yet, with his evident 
appreciation of these works, there flows along an 
undercurrent of the thought embodied in Count 
Tolstoi's '' Kreutzer Sonata," the thought that this 
great art is in the deepest sense immoral, full of 
sinful promptings, and dangerous to the soul's wel- 
fare. We feel bound to repudiate this conception 
as vehemently as we may, and to assert instead 
that the mind in which it can arise is morbidly 
affected, and incapable of the purest vision of beauty 
and truth. If we were to style " Evelyn Innes " an 
immoral book, it would be upon this ground rather 
than that of the life led by the heroine. 

Mr. Crockett seems to have written himself 
nearly out. It is undeniable that his stories of the 
struggle for the Covenant display both knowledge 
and vigor, and, if he has diluted the vigor with 
overmuch of modern sentimentalism, the product 
still has power to stir the blood, and help us to a 
vivid conception of the old rough life of seventeenth 
century Scotland. But he has told his tale as best 
he knows how, and there is no reason why he should 
continue to tell it with slight variations. " The

Standard Bearer " would interest us deeply were it 
not the latest of a long line of romantic fictions ; 
being such, and the product of a narrowly limited 
imagination, we know just what is coming, and can 
find no great zest in the reading. 

" The Lake of Wine " is an exciting story of 
England a hundred years ago, written in a most 
pernicious style of the would-be Meredithian sort. 
The search for a great ruby ( for the fanciful title 
means just that) in an out-of-the-way country house, 
the crimes of the cutthroat who first stole it, and of 
the scoundrel who sought to regain it after he had 
met his deserts on the gallows, provide the story 
with its substance, and set in motion an ingeniously- 
contrived plot. The story is interesting in spite of 
the perverse language in which it is written, and has 
the happy ending which readers of such stories 
rightfully expect. 

The very title of Mr. Gissing's new novel strikes 
the note of restlessness and dull cynicism by which 
it is pervaded. " The Whirlpool " is, of course, 
modern society as it exists in London, or, for that 
matter, any other great city. More, perhaps, than 
the author's earlier books, this one seeks to produce 
the impression that civilization is about played out. 
The programme is not inspiring, to say the least, 
and there is a petulant quality to Mr. Gissing's 
cynicism which makes its sincerity seem doubtful. 
Imagine a Thackeray without humor, without ten- 
derness, and without much real insight into human 
nature, and you have the author of " The Whirl- 
pool " and its fellows. The effect is dismal enough, 
when it is added that the author is committed to 
the austere theory of fiction that does not permit a 
story to get anywhere in particular, or to offer any- 
thing more than a random chapter from the annals 
of everyday life. 

Why should story-tellers be at the pains to invent 
plots when history offers them ready-made? Such 
seems to have been the attitude of Messrs. Louis 
Becke and Walter Jeffery when, casting about in 
search of material for a new story of the southern 
seas, they hit upon the tragical history of the Bounty 
and its mutineers. While heightening the dramatic 
effect of the story here and there, and giving it an 
artistic veneer of minor incident, the authors have 
kept close to the main lines of the actual occurrences, 
and shown that the history of the famous mutineer 
colony of Pitcairn Island makes as thrilling a ro- 
mance as any that was ever imagined. These events 
took place a full hundred years ago, but they seem 
only of yesterday when we read about them in these 
pages. The details are all provided the brutality 
of Captain Bligh, the revolt of the men, the expul- 
sion of the captain and those who remained loyal 
to him, the long voyage in search of a safe refuge, 
the final settlement upon Pitcairn Island, and the 
bloody feuds that wiped out the greater number of 
the colonists. It is all truth, yet certainly stranger 
than most of what we call fiction. The authors are 
to be congratulated upon the skill with which they 
have worked this material into romantic form. 



"The Nigger of the Narcissus," by Mr. Joseph 
Conrad, has been one of the most successful books 
of the year in England. For some utterly unac- 
countable reason, its American publishers have seen 
fit to rechristen it with the commonplace title The 
Children of the Sea," a piece of foolishness matched 
only by the substitution of " Transformation " for 
"The Marble Faun." It is not a story in the ordi- 
nary sense, for it has no plot, no interplay of motive, 
no mystery deftly concealed until the proper mo- 
ment for disclosure. It is simply the account of 
one voyage of a trading vessel from India to En- 
gland, told by an inhabitant of the forecastle, and 
made stirring by nothing more dramatic than a 
storm encountered in rounding the Cape, and an 
abortive mutiny near the close of the voyage. Its 
power lies in its exposition of the psychology of the 
mutiny, of the storm (if this metonymy be allowed), 
and of certain typical characters among officers and 
crew. In addition to power, it has style, a thing 
not adequately to be illustrated within this narrow 
space, but for which one brief passage, suggested by 
the sight of an unlettered seaman reading one of 
the garish early novels of Bulwer/ may be allowed 
to stand. " Are those beings who exist beyond the 
pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical 
disclosure of a resplendent world that exists within 
the frontier of infamy and filth, within that border 
of dirt and hunger, of misery and dissipation, that 
comes down on all sides to the water's edge of the 
incorruptible ocean, and is the only thing they know 
of life, the only thing they see of surrounding land, 
those lifelong prisoners of the sea? " The book 
contains many such things as this, passages of terse 
and superb poetic vigor, passages that suggest the 
magical utterance of a " Charles Egbert Craddock " 
or a Pierre Lot i." As for the psychological aspect 
of it, we doubt if a more searching study of seafar- 
ing life has ever been worked out. 

Mr. Conrad has been a fairly prolific writer since 
he made his first appearance, two or three years 
ago, with "Almayer's Folly," and we now have from 
him, at the same time with the longer work above 
described, a collection of five Tales of Unrest." 
Three of them are sketches of the Dutch and Span- 
ish Indies, a region which Mr. Conrad's imagination 
has annexed to English literature almost as com- 
pletely as British India has been annexed by the 
imagination of Mr. Kipling, or the South Sea Islands 
by Stevenson and Mr. Stoddard. " Karain : a 
Memory " and " An Outpost of Progress " are mas- 
terly studies of the contact of civilization with the 
alien races of the East Indies. The product of a 
sombre temperament, which absorbs the prismatic 
colors of oriental life, reflecting the duller hues 
alone, it is clear that they show forth but one phase 
of an existence that must have many others ; but 
this truth is so convincing that we are made to for- 
get, while under their spell, that the world may be 
fair, and the skies blue, even to an English trader 
among the Malays.

ers of the Ghetto " will find themselves compelled 
to revise their earlier estimate of the writer's abili- 
ties. Heretofore, he has stood as the embodiment 
of a sort of commonplace cleverness, and most of 
his work has been so ill-planned and diffuse as to 
be impossible from any artistic point of view. Even 
when he has dealt with the customs and character 
of his own race, his view has seemed superficial, his 
method to single out the grotesque and the acci- 
dental rather than the essential and permanent as- 
pects of Jewish life and tradition. Occasional 
flashes of insight have not, indeed, been wanting, 
but the most generous criticism could hardly have 
found in them the promise of such a book as the 
one now before us. In this series of sketches 
half story and half philosophical disquisition we 
have the very soul of the Jewry, the vital expression 
of its thought, its poetry, and its ideal aspirations. 
We have also a vast display of the lore that clusters 
about the Talmud and the Cabalah, and many epi- 
sodes from the dusty annals of the author's race 
spring from the domain of chronicle into that of 
life at his command. Some of the characters chosen 
for study by Mr. Zangwill are familiar to the gen- 
eral reader Spinoza, Heine, Maimon, Lassalle, 
Uriel Acosta, others are absolutely unknown to 
the everyday public. A few, again, are creations 
of his own, and here we must mention the exquisite 
story of " A Child of the Ghetto," with which the 
collection opens, and the marvellous fantasy, " Chad 
Gadya," with which it closes. The book is deeply 
significant, both as a richly sympathetic and imag- 
inative interpretation of the Jewish ideal, and as an 
altogether unexpected revelation of the powers hith- 
erto latent in its author. From now on, Mr. Zang- 
will must be taken seriously. 

Mr. Bret Harte's " Tales of Trail and Town " is 
shown by the publishers' list prefixed to the book to 
be the thirty-fourth volume of " novels and stories " 
by this perennial writer. Incidentally, it makes 
one wonder, thinking also of Mr. Henry James and 
a host of others, whether London is not, after all, 
the chief of the American literary centres about 
which Mr. Howells has recently discoursed so 
charmingly. There are seven stories in the new 
volume, five of them wholly American, the other 
two of international flavor. The author gratifies 
his taste for sharp contrasts in the story of " The 
Strange Experience of Alkali Dick," a " Booflobil " 
weary of the ways of civilization, who has a sur- 
prising adventure in a French chateau on his way 
to the seaport of Le Havre. " The Judgment of 
Bolinas Plain " will be recognized by many as the 
original from which the play called " Sue " has been 
dramatized. The longest and most serious of these 
stories is " The Ancestors of Peter Atherley," a 
really remarkable study of the influence of heredity. 

Our fiction offers few examples of an evolution 
so remarkable as that illustrated by Mr. Henry 
Harland. From " As It Was Written " and " Mrs. 
Peixada " to the " Comedies and Errors " of his 
latest volume is a progress indeed, and in the fine 



artistic feeling of Mr. Harland's recent work we find 
it almost impossible to recognize the pen that offered 
us those crude efforts of melodramatic sensational- 
ism. For these " Comedies and Errors " reveal the 
instinct of the true artist, the sense of form, the 
compression and restraint, the lightness of touch 
and the deft handling of incident that characterize 
the short stories of the most famous practitioners. 
Mr. Harland has not gone to the school of the best 
Frenchmen in vain, and has at last shown himself 
capable of workmanship so delicate that we have 
not the heart to say aught but praise concerning it. 

Mr. Henry Fuller is another of our younger story- 
writers whose artistic development has been steady 
and sure, although in his case the contrast is not so 
marked between his first book and his last. He 
may well be proud of the achievement represented 
by the four stories entitled " From the Other Side." 
Some if not all of them have previously appeared in 
the magazines, but they deserve a reperusal. " The 
Pilgrim Sons " is perhaps the happiest of the four, 
as embodying the most definite idea, although 
" What Youth Can Do " stands as a close second. 
Mr. Fuller has the gift of style, which is much, and 
the gift of restraint, which is more. 

Last of all upon our list comes the collection of 
stories by Mr. T. R. Sullivan, properly enough en- 
titled " Ars et Vita," although the part of " Ara " 
in them is small. They are bright sketches of 
European life, some of them grouped about the 
year 1870-71 and the happenings of the war period. 
Their interest is rather sentimental than dramatic, 
and they do not strike deep enough into life to leave 
any very definite impression. They are, in a word, 
the sort of thing whose production is fostered by the 
popular magazine, and they fulfil their function of 
passing entertainment in a satisfactory fashion.

A figure for 
the novelist. 



Those who have learned their Scotch 
history entirely from Scott may not 
remember Kirkaldy of Grange. We 
do not recollect that he is more than mentioned in 
the Waverley Novels, although two of them are de- 
voted to the time in which he played his part. In 
the " Abbot " he helps to rout the too-impetuous 
attack of the enthusiastic followers of Mary Queen 
of Scots at Langside. There he is called " cele- 
brated " and " the first soldier of Europe," though 
he was contemporary with Don John of Austria 
and Admiral Coligny. Sir William Kirkaldy was 
a distinctly romantic figure in a romantic period, 
and it is a little singular that Scott should not have 
found his career attractive. He was one of that 
band which assassinated Cardinal Beaton, and stood 
siege in the castle of St. Andrews until driven out 
by the French cannon. With John Knox and others 
he was carried prisoner to France ; and while Knox

WM sent to the galleys, he was confined in Mont 
St. Michel, whence he managed to escape. Return- 
ing to Scotland, he took part with those who thought 
to punish the murderers of Darnley ; and to that 
end, after the fiasco of Carberry Hill, he pursued 
Bothwell up to his earldom of Orkney and compelled 
him to seek ref oge in Norway. After the battle of 
Langside, he held Edinburgh Castle against the 
Regent Lenox, and against his successor, the Earl 
of Mar, but was brought to terms by the English 
bombardment, taken, and finally executed. Here 
is certainly material for the romancer. Scott did 
not deal with it, nor did Stevenson. Of the two, 
we should say it would have been more to the mind 
of the latter. The cannon on the steeple of St. 
Andrews' Church, the escape from Mont St. Michel 
over the waste of sand at low tide, the wild chase of 
the Earl of Bothwell among the Northern Inlands, 
and the wreck of the Unicorn " in the rock-sin- wn 
channel, these seem rather incidents in a novel of 
Stevenson's than in one of Scott's. But even more 
like Stevenson's material was the character of Kirk- 
aldy himself. Stevenson would have been at home 
in the portrayal of that " honorable man and brave 
patriot " who seemed in turn traitor to all. Mr. 
L. A. Barbe, who writes the life of Kirkaldy in the 
" Famous Scots " series (imported by Scribner), has 
for an aim rather to show the honesty of purpose 
of the man than to exhibit the romantic elements 
in his career. We hope that his view is as well- 
founded as he makes appear, although that question 
would seem to be beyond all who are not especially 
versed in Scottish history. At any rate, the book 
is an interesting record of a striking figure, and may 
be read with pleasure even by those who never 
heard of its subject.

lightness that has no savor of levity, and who en- 
deavor to make of it a calling and a mission rather 
than a trade. For durable literary work Mr. Mac- 
donell had no time, his life being occupied as a 
writer of " leaders." His popularity with the pro- 
fession was great, and it was said when he died that 
had the train which carried his friends from London 
to Beckenham, where his funeral was held, been 
wrecked, Liberal journalism in London would mo- 
mentarily have stopped. Mr. Macdonell worked at 
his profession successively at Aberdeen (he was by 



birth a Scotchman), Edinburgh, Newcastle, and 
London. He was on the staff of the " Times " when 
he died ; and it was said of him by a well-known 
writer that " he was probably the most brilliant and 
accomplished of all the men of genius who, by their 
modest but not unfruitful labors, have given the 
4 Times ' the great place it now holds among the 
newspapers of the world." Mr. Macdonell had a 
distinguished circle of friends (with him an acquaint- 
ance usually meant a friend), and Dr. Nicoll has 
judiciously leavened his text with glimpses of and 
chat about people of whom the world still w lubes to 
know more. The letters, both of Mr. Macdonell 
and his accomplished wife, written many of them 
during holiday jaunts to the Continent, are pleasant 
reading, and of these there is good store. In short, 
Dr. Nicoll has produced one of the best and most 
graceful biographical sketches (it is not too big) we 
have seen in a long while one that we heartily 
recommend as a model for writers with a similar 
work on their hands. American journalists will 
find the book a profitable study of the career of a 
distinguished English member of their calling. 
There is a good portrait of Mr. Macdonell. 

The latest addition to The Ethical 
Library " ( Macmillan ) is Professor 
Henry Sidgwick's volume called 
" Practical Ethics." It is a collection of serious 
and discriminating essays on matters of everyday 
life and conduct. Of special interest at the present 
moment is the chapter on " The Morality of Strife," 
showing that, from an ethical point of view, war is 
not to be regarded as an unmixed evil, that it is 
not a mere collision of passions and cupidities, but 
a conflict in which usually each side conceives itself 
to be contending on behalf of legitimate interests, 
and is due, as a rule, to conflicting views of rights. 
Chapters on Luxury " and " The Pursuit of Cul- 
ture " are full of suggestive thought on these living 
subjects, while the ones on " The Ethics of Religious 
Conformity " and on " Clerical Veracity," may be 
heartily commended to the consideration of unor- 
thodox persons in orthodox churches and pulpits. 



"Practical

A memorial of 

a man 



" In a sketchy sort of way," wrote 
Judge Rearden of his discussion of 
Ballads and Lyrics, and of his essay 
on Petrarch, not more than a sketchy review, the 
materials for which might be examined by anyone 
in an hour's time spent in an ordinary public library." 
Essays which can be so characterized depend much 
for interest upon charm of style and breadth of 
culture on the part of their author. Judge Rearden, 
who died some years ago, was for many years one 
of the foremost men of letters in San Francisco. 
He did not write much, although some of his work 
appeared in the early numbers, we believe, of The 
Overland Magazine." These essays (" Petrarch 
and Other Essays," Doxey) are pleasant wander- 
ings over familiar fields at least some of them 
are and are full of a polished scholarship and a 



1898.]

genial temper. The essays on Klaus Groth and 
Fritz Renter offer something more and something 
less, more, in that they will introduce most read- 
ers to new ground, and less in that there is little of 
that observation and familiar comment that makes 
the others agreeable. These essays are not definite 
treatises on their subjects ; they are rather desul- 
tory, except where biographical. But in such diva- 
gations one is always likely to find something to his 
mind ; almost everybody will pick out something 
new and interesting. This volume seems to be a 
second edition, although the fact is not noted, nor 
is any editor named. It is a pity that there was no 
competent editor. Judge Rearden would have been 
vexed at being made to mention among Tennyson's 
poems, " Brackett," " Nemuc," " Aenone." Of such 
slips, however, there are not very many, so that on 
the whole the volume is a fit memorial of a culti- 
vated man. 

With the seventh volume of Profes- 
The founding of the sor yon Sybel's "Founding of the 

German Empire. _^ ^_ . TTTH. T 

German Empire by William I. 
(Crowell) this valuable work is completed. This 
volume gives the history not only of Germany, but 
of France, and in a measure of Spain, Italy, and 
Austria, from the spring of 1868 to the outbreak 
of the great war in 1870. It is in part a continu- 
ation of the topics treated in the preceding volume ; 
but it brings them to a most dramatic conclusion. 
The oft-told story is given clearly and interestingly, 
of course from the German point of view, but fairly, 
and, as seems likely, largely as it will finally stand 
in history. Of timely interest is the description of 
unhappy Spain and her efforts to secure a king after 
her revolution. One prince after another put aside 
the proffered crown with disdain, and Leopold only 
accepted it after thrice rejecting it, and then de- 
clined it again when France became so astonishingly 
excited. But the great topic is the steady progress 
of Germany under Bismarck's rule toward the uni- 
fication that had been the dream of her poets and 
patriots, and had seemed, until he appeared, so im- 
possible of attainment. Along with this went the 
desperate effort of France to maintain her old lead- 
ership in Europe, the failure of her policy in one 
attempt after another, the discrediting of the Em- 
pire, and the popular desire for a war that should 
reduce the presumptuous Prussian to the position 
he had occupied after Jena and restore the glory of 
France. The author seems to be successful in prov- 
ing that the war was not a diabolical scheme of 
Bismarck to ruin France, but that France brought 
her ruin upon her own head. 

The grammar Professor John Earle's "Simple 
of English. Grammar of English Now in Use" 

now m use. (Putnam) is as interesting as a gram- 

mar can be, and, since it has to do with the language 
as written and spoken in England to-day, is prob- 
ably more interesting to an American than to the 
author's own countrymen. Though a professor in 



Anglo-Saxon in Oxford, his knowledge is used to 
illuminate, not to dazzle, the treatment of the sub- 
ject. But why should Numerals be erected into a 
tenth Part of Speech? And, after writing in one 
place that " our language, which is more advanced 
toward simplicity and truth than any other language, 
has discarded this unmeaning Gender of Nouns," 
and in another, " Gender cannot be said to survive 
anywhere in the English language except in the 
Personal Pronoun of the Third Person Singular," 
does Professor Earle give his nouns not merely a 
possessive, but a dative, an accusative, and a voca- 
tive case ? Surely, though logical cases, like logical 
gender, remain, grammatical cases have gone the 
way of the others in English, and " cannot be said 
to survive anywhere in the English language except 
in the . . . pronoun." It is noteworthy that British 
use holds to forms like " one and twenty," " one and 
twentieth," while ranking " bidden," " drunken," 
" stricken," and " gotten," with " foughten," " shot- 
ten," and the like ; does away with the differences 
of person in the subjunctive use of " would " and 
" should," and permits shade of Richard Grant 
White ! such a tense as the " Continuous Present 
Passive ": " I am being taken, thou art being 
taken," etc. 

American The second volume of Professor 

history told by Hart's series of " American History 
contemporaries. Told by Contemporaries " (Macmil- 
lan) is, in its essential features, a reproduction of 
the first volume, and fairly sustains the reputation 
which that publication created. Perhaps some read- 
ers will think the matter, on the whole, less valu- 
able ; but such judgment, if given, will, not unlikely, 
be influenced by the critic's greater interest in the 
one period than in the other. Certainly some of the 
matter hardly seems worth reproducing. Chapter 
XIV. on " Intellectual Life," for example, strikes us 
as nothing less than poor. We do not see, either, 
that the editor's notes are more abundant than in 
the former volume, which was criticized on this 
score. Professor Hart is one of the best of the 
large number of men who are now cultivating Amer- 
ican history ; he is rendering the cause good service 
in this series, but he distinctly impresses us as being 
a man who has too many irons in the fire. 



Studies in 
American 
literature. 



Professor Charles Noble's " Studies 
in American Literature " ( Macmil- 
lan) is a well-arranged text-book for 
academies and high schools. Books on this subject 
have been numerous of late ; the special aim of this 
one is to treat especially of form in its relation to 
literary expression, to furnish a method of analysis 
which shall combine the study of an author's man- 
ner and method along with the interpretation of his 
content. Not the least of the merits of the volume 
is its up-to-date character, dealing with the last 
twenty years and with living writers. The portraits 
of American writers are numerous and, for the most 
part, excellent.

[Aug. 1, 



Under * UUe "Various Frag- 
mentB " (Appleton), Mr. Herbert 
Spencer publishes a collection of 
seventeen articles on topics more or less related to 
his usual themes. All of them have been previously 
published, either in magazines, pamphlets, or as 
chapters in early editions of his books. Some date 
back nearly half a century, and relate to dead issues ; 
some are " rejoinders " to his critics. Each has ita 
special significance and value, and taken together 
they strikingly illustrate the varied interests of one 
of the leading thinkers of our century. The book 
is uniform in style and binding with the volumes of 
the Synthetic Philosophy," and hence forms a part 
of the complete edition of this epoch-making series. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor William Macdonald of Bowdoin College 
has edited a series of " Select Documents Illustrative 
of the History of the United States, 1776-1861 " (Mac- 
mil Ian). It is a work of the utmost value to teachers 
and students of American history, for it brings them 
into close contact with the sources, a condition " now 
rightly insisted upon as the basis of all sound historical 
knowledge." The documents given number nearly a 
hundred, from the Declaration of Independence to the 
Constitution of the Confederate States of America. 
Some have been condensed, and many others " are in 
the form of significant extracts only," thus bringing the 
entire series within the compass of less than five hundred 
pages. Each document is supplied with a brief intro- 
duction and select bibliography." 

The " Globe " edition of " The Works of Geoffrey 
Chaucer " (Macmillan) is a welcome publication, albeit 
the one- volume edition of the " Oxford " Chaucer some- 
what forestalled the welcome that has long awaited the 
later volume. Projected over thirty years ago, the 
work has at last been completed under the editorial 
supervision of Mr. Alfred W. Pollard, assisted by 
Messrs. H. Frank Heath, Mark H. Liddell, and W. S. 
McCormick. The volume extends to between eight and 
nine hundred double-columned pages. 

The following are publications of the American Book 
Co., in their series of "Eclectic English Classics": 
Pope's "Rape of the Lock," and "Essay on Man," 
edited by Mr. A. M. Van Dyke; " Selections from the 
Poems of Robert Burns," edited by Mr. W. H. Venable; 
similar " Selections " from Wordsworth and Byron, also 
edited by Mr. Venable; " Selections " from Gray, edited 
by Mr. Van Dyke, and Dryden's " Palamon and Arcite," 
not edited by anyone, as far as we can ascertain. 

The following are the latest text-books for teachers 
of English: Dryden's " Palamon and Arcite " (Heath), 
edited by Mr. W. H. Crayshaw; another edition of the 
same (Maynard), unacknowledged ; Macaulay's " Essay 
on Addison" (Ginn), edited by Dr. Herbert A. Smith; 
De Quincey's " Confessions of an English Opium Eater " 
(Heath), edited by Dr. George A. Waucbope; "The 
Story-Teller's Art " (Ginn), a guide to the elementary 
study of fiction, by Miss Charity Dye; "Some Common 
Errors of Speech " (Putnam), by Mr. Alfred G. Comp- 
ton ; and " The Principles of Grammar " (Macmillan), by 
Mr. Herbert J. Davenport and Miss Anna M. Emerson. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

" Poems Here at Home " is the title of Volume VIII. 
in the new edition of Mr. J. W. Kiley's writings, now 
in course of publication by the Messrs. Scribner. 

" The Planter's Plea," printed by William Jones, 
London, 1630, is the latest issue in Mr. George P. 
Humphrey's series of American Colonial Tracts." 

The Dibdin Club will soon publish, in a small limited 
edition, a work on " Booktrade Bibliography in the 
United States in the Nineteenth Century," by Mr. A. 
Growoll, of " The Publishers' Weekly." 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have just sent us 
Volume VII. of " Frederick the Great," in their " Cen- 
tenary " Carlyle, and " Rboda Fleming " and " The 
Egoist," in their new library edition of Mr. George 
Meredith's novels. 

Messrs. William B. Hadley, of the New Amsterdam 
Book Co., and Mr. E. Roscoe Matbews, recently con- 
nected with Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, have formed 
a partnership for tbe publication of new books and the 
importation of English editions. 

Tbe Shakespeare Press, Westfield, Union County, 
N. J., announces a limited edition of the " Four-Text 
Hamlet," as heretofore projected by tbe New York 
Shakespeare Society. Tbe work will be a folio, in 
twelve parts, at two dollars a part. Advanced subscrip- 
tions of twenty dollars will secure the entire work. 

Professor William Knight has recently presented to 
tbe trustees of Dove Cottage his important collection of 
Wordsworthiana, including editions, manuscripts, let- 
ters, portraits, and miscellaneous relics. The Rev. 
Stopford Brooke, acknowledging this gift on behalf of 
the trustees, speaks in fitting terms of the donor's " frank 
and magnificent generosity," and refers to Dove Cottage 
as now " a goal of pilgrimage second only to Stratford- 
on-Avon " in tbe minds of lovers of literature. 

John Moses, who died in Chicago early last month 
was the author of " Illinois, Historical and Statistical," 
and was for many years librarian of the Chicago His- 
torical Society. He also collaborated with tbe late 
Joseph Kirkland in writing a " History of Chicago." 
Born in Canada in 1825, he came to Illinois when a 
boy, became private Secretary to Governor Yates, and 
served on tbe bench of his adopted State. He was a 
man of quiet intellectual tastes and marked ability as 
both scholar and writer. 

II err G. Hedeler, of Leipzig, has just sent us Part III. 
of his useful " Verzeichniss von I rivat-Bibliothekeu." 
This volume is devoted to private libraries in Germany, 
of which 817 are briefly described, alphabetically listed, 
and indexed as to their principal subjects. The de- 
scriptions are in English, German, and French. Amer- 
ican owners of libraries not represented in earlier parts 
of this publication are requested to communicate par- 
ticulars of their collections to the publisher, who makes 
no charge for insertion in his lists. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole has printed, in a private 
limited edition, a bilingual " Omar Khayyam," the text 
of Fit/. Gerald's final revision occupying the right-band 
pages, while facing them are tbe quatrains of an elegiac 
Latin version by Mr. Herbert Wilson Greene, of Ox- 
ford. Mr. Greene's tour de force was completed five 
years ago, and printed in an edition of a hundred copies, 
which are now almost impossible to get. Fitz Gerald 
himself experimented a little in Latin versions of the 
Rubaiyat, writing once to Professor Cowell: " You will

think me a perfectly Aristophanic Old Man, when I tell 
you how many of Omar I could not help running into 
such bad Latin." Mr. Dole's edition is published with 
the consent of both Mr. Greene and Fitz Gerald's lit- 
erary executor, and makes the prettiest of vest-pocket 
volumes, bound in flexible green leather a delicate 
tribute to the translator. 

The " Complete Prose Works " of Walt Whitman, 
just published by Messrs. Small, Maynard, & Co., is a 
companion to the " Leaves of Grass," and thus makes it 
possible to possess, in two handsome volumes, the en- 
tire mass of Whitman's work, excepting only the letters 
styled " The Wound Dresser," which appear in a sup- 
plementary collection. We have here the " Specimen 
Days and Collect," " November Boughs," and " Good 
Bye, My Fancy," filling over five hundred pages alto- 
gether, beautifully printed and bound. There are six 
full-page illustrations. 

Mrs. Elizabeth Lynn Linton, who died in London on 
the fourteenth of July, was the widow of the famous 
wood-engraver, William J. Linton, and was herself a 
writer of long established reputation. She was born at 
Keswick in 1822, and married Mr. Linton in 1858. 
Although they separated soon after, he coming to Amer- 
ica to live, the relations between them remained ami- 
cable. Mrs. Linton wrote innumerable magazine articles 
and short stories, besides a considerable number of 
longer works of fiction. " The True History of Joshua 
Davidson " is probably her most important and charac- 
teristic work. 

The " Municipal History and Present Organization 
of the City of Chicago " is a doctoral thesis presented 
to the University of Wisconsin by Mr. Samuel Edwin 
Sparling, and published as a Bulletin of that institution. 
In preparing the monograph, Mr. Sparling has not only 
served himself, but has also rendered an important ser- 
vice to the city with which the work is concerned, for 
such a conspectus of the history of Chicago in its legal 
and administrative aspects has not before been published, 
and has long been a desideratum. The work is brought 
up to date by a description of the new laws respecting 
taxation and primary elections. 

The prevailing war spirit moved Mr. Edmund Gosse 
lately to write a poem called " A Night in Time of 
War " for the London " Saturday Review." But when 
the poem appeared in print the author was amazed to 
read 

"Faint, faint, these mildewed chords that twang 
So feebly, where the music rang 
Deep organ-notes when omer sang I " 

Whether the Greek or the Persian poet was meant was 
evidently what troubled the conscientious compositor 
who made this ingenious compromise. 

The final retirement of Mr. Horace E. Scudder from 
the editorship of " The Atlantic Monthly," although not 
from his connection with the publishing business of 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., is only the fulfilment of 
a step anticipated by the public ever since Mr. Walter H. 
Page became associated with the magazine three years 
ago. That this change has not resulted in losing for the 
" Atlantic " its old-time supremacy over our other mag- 
azines is evident enough from a glance at the bound 
volume for the half-year just ended, a volume which 
for dignity, discrimination in the editing, agreeable 
variety of contents, and unfailing literary excellence, 
may easily challenge comparison with any of the eighty 
that have preceded it.

Studies in American Literature. 

By CHARLES NOBLE. 

12mo, Cloth, $1.OO net. 

THIS book is intended as an introduction to the study of 
Literature. Its plan rests upon the belief that the forms 
of Composition, in prose and verse, should be taught early in 
the course of education, and can best be taught by the study 
of the Literature in which they are embodied. 

In the Introduction the elements of form are given, as sim- 
ply as possible, with examples from American authors. The 
following chapters contain a historical survey of our Litera- 
ture. In each period the works are classified according to the 
accepted divisions of Epic, Lyric, and Dramatic verse ; and 
Narrative, Expository, and Oratorical prose. Under each 
division, characteristic selections are studied with reference 
to form and content. The effort is to make these studios 
suggestive to the teacher, and to prepare the student for more 
thorough analytical study in more advanced courses.

A TEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

n. 

In Germany at present the drama dominates 
all the other literary forms, and to it three- 
fifths of the year's summary is devoted. The 
names of Herr Sudermann and Herr Haupt- 
mann stand foremost among the dramatists, 
and, since the latter has produced no new play 
of late, the "Johannes" of the former is un- 
questionably the book of the twelvemonth. Of 
the circumstances attending the stage-produc- 
tion of this work, we are informed as follows : 

" A Christian state, such as Prussia still is officially, 
even though it does not use the term, cannot be blamed 
for objecting to see personages hallowed by tradition 



and religious veneration made the subject of dramatic 
liberties and too vivid actual presentation. On this ac- 
count the performance of this tragedy in Berlin was 
postponed until January 14th, 1898, although it had 
been ready some time previously, and then it was not 
the Court stage of the royal Schauspielhaus, but the 
private stage of the Deutsches Theatre, that witnessed 
the performance." 

Historical dramas in a stricter sense are still 
written in Germany in considerable numbers, 
although the public interest in them seems to 
be on the wane. " Alarich, Koenig der West- 
gothen," by Herr Verdy du Vernois, and Herr 
Domanig's Tyrolese trilogy of Andreas Hofer, 
are the most remarkable examples of this spe- 
cies. In general, we are told that "at the 
present time the stage is held by coarse popular 
plays, farces, bourgeois drama, dramatized 
stories, and of late fairy tales, with all the cus- 
tomary musical and optical effects." The plays 
discussed most fully in the present article are 
" Neigung," by Herr J. J. David ; " Agnes 
Jordan," by Herr Georg Hirschfeld ; " Mutter 
Erde," by Herr Max Halbe, and an unnamed 
love drama by Herr Heyse, with Vanina Vanini, 
for a heroine, and based upon the Italian con- 
spiracies of the early part of this century. 
Herr Heyse has also published a collection of 
"Neue Gedichte und Jugendlieder," and re- 
mains Germany's most brilliant poet in the 
classical manner. The modern German short 
story, which derives also from Herr Heyse, is 
illustrated this year by the volumes " Aus Alter 
Schule," by Frau von Ebner - Eschenbach ; 
" Tiefe Wasser," by Herr von Wildenbruch ; 
and " Novellen aus Oesterreich," by Herr von 
Saar. "Amid the deluge of novels, 'Arachne,' by 
Dr. Georg Ebers, and * Ebroin,' by Herr Felix 
Dahn, are remarkable rather for the names of 
their authors than the novelty of their contents. 
We have a sort of impression of having read 
them both before, although we know well enough 
that this can only have been among the works 
of the same authors." The former takes us 
back to the Alexandrian epoch and the latter 
to the period of the Volkerwanderung. Other 
works of fiction are Herr Guido List's " Car- 
nuntum " and " Ossip Schubin's " " Wenn's 
Nur Schon Winter War ! " both Austrian ro- 
mances, the one of ancient, the other of modern 
times. Works of serious scholarship include 
the following : " Bismarck und der Bundes-

Konigslientenant," by Herr Schubart ; " Neue

mann Grimm ; " Geschichte des Untergangs

Baumgiirtner ; " Dante and Dessen Verhiiltniss 
zu Kunst and Politik," by Herr Franz Xaver 
Kraus ; and " Erinnerunger au Brahms," by 
Herr J. Victor Widmann. 

We are told of Denmark : 

"The literary movement which commenced some 
twenty-five yean ago with the lectures of Dr. Georg 
Brandes is now ebbing fast By some it was styled 
realism, by others Brandesianism. Dr. Brandes him- 
self called it naturalism. . . . What he meant by nat- 
uralism was a theory strictly opposed to clericalism or 
any form of clericalism, a culture of nature in the widest 
sense of the word, it being strictly understood that 
there is no room for elements of orthodox and revealed 
religion or morals in this system. He was not an inno- 
vator in the same sense as Grundtvig, the author of 
novel ideas which would never have appeared if he had 
not given them life; but he was the spokesman of new 
thoughts and feelings which were just then in vogue in 
the great centres of civilization, but had not as yet 
reached us. Our literary criticisms were still abstract 
and rested on the terminology of Hegel. Brandes intro- 
duced the realistic methods of Taine and Sainte-Beuve, 
based on the philosophy of Comte and others. But at 
the same time it must be acknowledged that he was 
something more than a literary critic in the general sense 
of the word: he was an enthusiastic and sympathetic 
interpreter of the great poets of all times and countries, 
a man who knew the charm of his own language, and 
mastered it as an artist, a fervent and fertile genius. 
... A literary movement which commenced its career 
as a hymn to the beauty and glory of natural life when 
liberated from Christianity and other moral and polit- 
ical restrictions has already changed into its own oppo- 
site, and confesses the inevitable and irredeemable mis- 
ery of human life, not on account of social prejudices 
and encumbrances, but on account of the conditions of 
life in themselves." 

Herr Edvard Brandes, a brother of the critic, 
illustrates this transformation in his " Lykkens 
Blaendvaerk " (The Delusion of Happiness), as 
pessimistic a book as is often seen. " En Kri- 
tisk Tid " (A Critical Time), by Herr Jacob 
Hansen, " deals with the striking problem how 
theoretical rejection of the freedom of the will 
may be realized in practice. The hero of this 
book (improperly termed so) is an interesting 
example of a human being in whom there is no 
feeling, no will, no conscience, only a series of 
reflections, almost mechanical. Yet there lies 
behind them a world of subdued feelings 
subdued because they would kill the person 
with remorse if they were set free." Herr 
Johannes Jorgensen, " who from an advanced 
standpoint went back to the Roman Church, 
which is here in Denmark a retrogression of 



more than three centuries and a half, has lately 
published a book called 'Helvedesf jender' (The 
Enemies of Hell) to demonstrate that those 
who now so passionately attack the dogma of 
hell use this pretence only as a mask for their 
hostility to Christianity itself. It is the sharp- 
est weapon that has been used against the ene- 
mies of the Church, and as a general defence 
of religious feeling it is eloquent and convinc- 
ing." Herr Einar Christiansen " has written 
a great drama called 'Cosmus,' in which he 
treats of modern social questions from a new 
standpoint. Each man, he says, has his place 
and his duties in his generation through his 
family. In fidelity towards his own kin and 
the duties it lays upon him he fulfils his duties 
towards humanity in general. In other words, 
we cannot all have the same social aims, but 
each of us must find his duties for himself in 
connection with his special position in life." 
Herr Drachmann " published last year no fewer 
than three dramas or melodramas, a form he 
has introduced in our literature. But brilliant 
and powerful as he is when he is at his best, he 
is empty and vaporous when he is at his worst ; 
and his Brav Karl ' (Good Fellow) is indeed 
one of his unsuccessful efforts. Even the songs 
introduced are not of his best. Dramatic he, 
on the whole, is not, and in this field he has not 
produced anything of more than ephemeral 
interest ; only the lyrics occurring in some of 
his dramas retain a certain value." Other books 
worth mentioning are Herr Nyrop's ** Kysset 
og ets Historic " (The Kiss and Its Story), a 
beautiful and most learned piece of pleasantry 
which really ought to be adapted and laid be- 
fore English readers," a second part of Herr 
Schandorph's "Memoirs," Herr C. Ewald's 
" James Singleton's Store Udenlands Kejse " 
(James Singleton's Great Journey Abroad), 
and the monograph on "Henrik Ibsen," pub- 
lished by Dr. Brandes on the occasion of the 
seventieth birthday of the great Norwegian 
poet and dramatist. 

" In Norway, the past twelve months have 
not produced any book of special importance," 
but they have witnessed the celebration of Dr. 
Ibsen's seventieth birthday, which calls for 
mention. The dramatist even made a brief 
speech now and then, upon banquets and other 
festive occasions. 

"The chief information he vouchsafed was that this 
Christmas the usual new play by him must not be looked 
for, though hitherto every other year such has been the 
case. It would seem that for the present Ibsen is occu- 
pied with compiling his memoirs, a work which is nat- 
turally looked forward to with the greatest interest He 



1898.]

is also seeing through the press a fresh edition of his 
collected works in the original as well as in a German 
translation. It caused no little sensation when, at a 
festive meeting of an Advanced Woman's Club, he dis- 
tinctly disclaimed that from his creation of ' Nora ' any 
inference should be drawn of his having headed the 
ranks of the supporters of women's emancipation. On 
the contrary, he asserted woman's true place in the 
social scale to be as wife and mother, to lay the founda- 
tion of morality and culture for the next generation." 

The drama is at present the most vital form of 
literature in Norway, and, although its two 
great exponents have produced no play during 
the year, no less than seven dramatic works of 
unusual merit are described by the writer. 
They are " Lindelin," by Herr Jonas Lie ; 
" The National Assembly," by Herr Gunnar 
Heiberg; " Johanne," by Herr Bjornson^/s/ 
"Godfather's Gift," by Herr Peter Egge; 
" Evening Red," by Herr Knut Harnsun ; 
" Drops of Red," by Herr Sigbjbrn Obstfelder ; 
and " Between the Processions," by Herr Hans 
Kinck. Under the heads of poetry and fiction 
we find nothing of any significance chronicled. 
Works of scholarship are " Our Younger Con- 
temporary Poets," by Herr Carl Naerup ; a study 
of Welhaven, by Dr. Arne Lochen ; " Keiser 
Hadrian," by Dr. A. Raeder ; and two supple- 
mentary accounts of Dr. Nansen's expedition, 
by Herr Nordahl and Lieutenant Johansen. 

In Sweden, " the past year has been remark- 
able for the revival of the national feeling in 
every department of literature. Even belles- 
lettres have been influenced by this national 
movement. Whereas formerly the romance 
mainly looked to everyday life for its subjects, 
striving after a photographic reproduction of 
facts, authors nowadays prefer to return to the 
past history of the Swedish people, and paint 
pictures of the life and culture of bygone times. 
. . . The historical story and romance have 
revived in a much improved form, inasmuch as 
they are founded upon more serious and thor- 
ough researches into the history of the times 
they delineate, and therefore, as a rule, present 
truer and more impressive pictures." The chief 
illustrations of this thesis are " Pictures of 
Sweden from the Sixteenth Century," by Herr 
Elof Tegner ; The Days of Gustaf III.," by 
Herr O. Levertin ; " A Knight of Fortune," 
by Herr H. Molander ; and stories from the 
time of Charles XII., by Herr Verner von 
Heidenstamm. 

" Miss Selma Lagerlof, who a few years ago excited 
considerable and well-merited attention by her romantic 
' Gosta Berlings Saga,' written in a strongly individual 
style, has this year published ' Antikrists Mirakler,' 
where, in the most charming manner, she relates the 



myths and legends of Sicily. This book has placed her 
at a bound in the front rank of Sweden's female authors. 
Another book by a woman, but in quite a different style, 
is ' Den Nya Verlden,' by Miss Hilma Angerod Strand- 
berg, which gives us an impressive and gloomy picture 
of the sufferings which a family of emigrants to America 
has to endure in the cruel struggle for existence." 

In poetry, there are new volumes by Herr 
Snoilsky and Herr C. D. af Wirsen. The fol- 
lowing interesting note concerns one of the 
most notorious, if not one of the greatest, of 
living Swedish writers : 

" Herr August Strindberg, the realist and Nihilist, 
has undergone a peculiar, if not altogether unexpected 
metamorphosis, inasmuch as he has stuck fast in an 
almost crazy mysticism and self-introspection. His 
' Inferno ' and ' Legender ' are the diaries of a sick soul, 
in which a sick man's thoughts and visions are treated 
as the most important events in the universe, and in 
which he alternately calls down the anathemas of heaven 
upon wasted lives and elevates his own particular ego 
into a centre around which everything is to revolve and 
to which everything is to be referred. But such books 
scarce belong to literature at all, though they may inter- 
est hospital physicians." 

A comment upon Nobel's "magnificent donation 
to humanity " closes the summary of Swedish 
literary activities. 

Contemporary Russian literature, we are told, 
"is in a condition of decay and stagnation. Having 
produced some great names which have gained a world- 
wide celebrity, Russian genius has for a time as it were 
exhausted itself. The heroic period of artistic produc- 
tion is ended, and the literary activity of contemporary 
Russia produces on the observer the same impression as 
is produced by dull, everyday life after a brilliant and 
noisy festival. Out of the number of books which have 
appeared during the past twelve months, only two or 
three are worthy of attention, to wit, the ' Tales ' of Mr. 
Anton Chekhov ; ' The Mirrors,' a collection of stories and 
poems by Mrs. Zenaida Gippius; ' Shadows,' a collection 
of tales and poems by Mr. Th. Sologub; and the second 
volume of the poems of Mrs. Lokhvitskaya, a young 
writer whose verses are always harmonious and devoted 
almost exclusively to the two eternal subjects, love and 
death. In them we feel the inexhaustible efflorescence 
of youth, the splendid luxury of a spring morning with 
its abundance of sound, colour, and fragrance." 

A good deal of attention has been given of late 
to translations from other modern literatures, 
and a new version of our own Poe has increased 
the circle of his friends in Russia. 

" During the past year in St. Petersburg there ap- 
peared a collection of the works of Dr. Henrik Ibsen in 
a Russian translation. The works of Byron, Shelley, 
Tennyson, and Burns have been translated afresh, and 
again find readers. It is by familiarizing itself with the 
great models of European poetry, and the careful study 
of them, that Russian literature will escape its contem- 
porary barrenness, and take to itself original forms." 

Two items of scholarly interest are the work on 
" Russian Poetry," by Mr. S. Vengerow, and 
the continuation of the same author's " Critico-

tic dimensions." 

" The Polish nation celebrates this jear the centenary 
of the greatest poet that she in particular, and the whole 
race of Slavs in general, has seen, Adam Mickiewicz. 
In all parts of old Poland this unusual occasion for fes- 
tival is being watched with a wide and deep interest, 
which must, however, in the different provinces take 
the form that local political conditions impose. The 
books and pamphlets suitable to the occasion pop- 
ular biographies, papers on the meaning of the poet and 
his works, historical memoirs, cantatas, pictures, etc. 
have already appeared or will do so in great numbers. 
National collections will also provide for two great 
monuments of Mickiewicz in Cracow and Warsaw, to 
be unveiled this year; the town of Lemberg is planning 
in the immediate future a third. Poland honours in 
Mickiewicz not only the first of her poets, but also a 
great patriot and spiritual leader." 

Among the publications of the year, the fol- 
lowing are the most important : " The Way to 
Luck," a story by Mr. T. T. Jez ; " The Angel 
of Death," by Mr. K. Tetmajer ; " Rust," by 
Mr. A. Krechowiecki ; " The Leader of the 
Dance," by Mrs. G. Zapolska ; " Baczmaha," 
by Mr. M. Pawlikowski ; and " The Life and 
Thoughts of Sigismund Podfilipski," by Mr. 
J. Weyssenhoff. These are all works of fiction. 
A number of successful plays are also men- 
tioned, including " Malka Schwarzenkopf " 
and "Hi*," both by Mrs. Zapolska. The 
" Dramas and Comedies " of Mr. Adam Belci- 
kowski, the writer of the article, have been 
published in five volumes. Three important 
publications in literary history are the " Adam 
Mickiewicz " of Mr. J. Kallenbach, the two- 
volume work " Our Dramatic Literature," of 
Mr. P. Chmielowski, and the first volume of 
Mr. H. Biegeleiseu's " Illustrated History of 
Polish Literature." " A few months since 
Polish literature sustained a loss that can never 
be repaired, in the death of two of her most 
important poets in modern times, Kornel 
Ujrjski and Adam Asnyk." Mr. Sienkiewiez 
has published nothing during the year, but we 
learn from other sources that he is engaged 
upon a historical romance to be entitled " The 
Knights of the Cross." 

The most important fact in the literary ac- 
tivity of Bohemia appears to be 
44 the approaching hundredth anniversary of the birth of 
Bohemia's most celebrated historian, whose fame, even 
in his lifetime, spread far beyond the boundaries of bis 
native land Francis Palacky. His genius placed him 
above all his contemporaries; his researches into the 
annals of his country were profound, systematic, and 
impartial; and the outcome of his life's labour, the vol- 
uminous ' History of the Bohemian Nation,' gained for 
him a position among the most celebrated of European 



historians. Of the numerous publications which are to 
appear on this occasion, the most valuable for the knowl- 
edge of this best of Bohemia's sons will be several vol- 
umes of his correspondence, which are to appear at the 
expense of the Academy of Science, and an essay which 
is being based on new matter due to the original re- 
search of Professor Goll." 

In belles-lettres, mention is made of an edition 
of Havlicek's poetical works, of Yrchlicky's 
new narrative poem " Bar-Kochba," of two 
other volumes of poems by the same author, 
and of Rohac na Sione," a historical poem by 
Svatopluk Cech. In fiction, there are Jirasek's 
U U Nas," Zeyer's " In the Dawn of the Gods " 
and " The House of the Drowning Star," and 
Kosmak's posthumous tale, " A Poisoned 
Rose." The drama has received a new impulse 
this year, " in consequence, perhaps, of the 
lively interest awakened by the attempt to es- 
tablish a second Bohemian theatre in Prague." 
The chief plays mentioned are Hilbert's pro- 
hibited " For God," Zeyer's fairy-piece " Raduz 
a Mahulena," Vrchlicky's comedy from King 
Arthur's times, " King and Fowler," and 
Kapil's " Princess Dandelion." 



COMMUNICA TION. 

WHERE ARE THE POETS OF THE CUBAN WAR? 

(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Will some reader of THE DIAL kindly essay an ex- 
planation of the curious and rather mortifying fact that 
the war now waging is evoking no poetry worth men- 
tioning ? America is prolific of poets to say nothing 
of poetasters; but as yet no TyrUean strain born of the 
occasion has fired the heart of the American soldier, and 
the heroic deeds of Manila and Santiago remain unsung. 
Not even a half-way respectable war-song " of the 
44 Marching Through Georgia " type has appeared. 
What has become of all the ladies and gentlemen who, 
in the piping times of peace, marvellously produce such 
floods of pretty magazine verse, albeit driven to themes 
as hackneyed as the Advent of Spring and as slight M 
the Death of a Canary Bird ? Why are they so strangely 
mute, now that the air is charged with the most potent 
forces of poetic inspiration, and while topics as tempt- 
ing as ever fired a patriotic pen are going a-begging ? 
Is the valor of American soldiers and sailors to miss the 
meed of song ? Think how eagerly Mr. Alfred Austin 
(who found it in him to celebrate even the abortive 
44 ride " and summary thrashing of " Doctor Jim ") 
would have improved the occasion had it been " Tommy 
Atkins" who won El Caney and stormed the heights of 
San Juanl Perhaps our poets are incubating things 
poetic that will appear and dazzle us in the fulness of 
time. But to your correspondent the dearth of spon- 
taneous verse of the kind indicated verse with a true 
native ring and breath of militant patriotism in it, such 
as our Civil War called forth in plenty, seems as dis- 
appointing as remarkable. \\ R. K.

THE CENTURY ATLAS.* 

The great "Century Atlas," uniform in size 
and shape with " The Century Dictionary " and 
" Cyclopedia of Names," is a completing and a 
companion volume to those important works. 
It contains no less than 117 double-page mod- 
ern maps, together with a still larger number 
of " corner or inset " maps. There are, more- 
over, two charts of the Heavens, a dozen or 
more pages of historical maps, and an ingen- 
ious " Index Chart " showing the number and 
extent of every map. Extensive indexes 
containing, it is said, the enormous number of 
170,000 names serve as keys to the exact 
location of every place upon the maps, and also, 
in some sort, as a gazetteer, inasmuch as the 
population of every land, district, and town is 
given, wherever ascertain able. These indexes 
are one of the most valuable features of the 
work. Especial features of the maps are the 
contour-lines (lines of equal elevation above the 
sea), which are printed in olive or brown ; and 
the admirable device of printing the lines of 
railroad in red, so as to distinguish them at a 
glance from the numerous lines traced in black. 
These maps do not exhibit topographical details 
so minutely as the carefully engraved and ar- 
tistic maps of Stieler's celebrated Hand- Atlas ; 
but they appear on the whole, at least to the 
American eye, somewhat clearer and easier of 
reference than the maps in Stieler. The editor 
states that all the maps " have been based upon 
the latest and best official information, with a 
comparison of the results of recent explora- 
tions." Such tests as I have been able to make 
have tended to confirm this statement. 

In attempting to form an opinion of the accu- 
racy and completeness of this Atlas, one natu- 
rally turns to the maps of those states with 
which one chances to be especially familiar. In 
the maps of the smaller states, which can be 
figured on these quarto pages on relatively large 
scales, there is little to complain of as regards 
detail. Thus, Vermont and New Hampshire 
are shown together transversely across the 
double page (i. e., so that the book must be 
turned), on the scale of thirteen miles to the 
inch ; New Jersey (also transversely) on the

scale of eleven miles to the inch ; Connecticut 
and Rhode Island on the scale of nine miles to 
the inch ; while the excellent map of Eastern 
Massachusetts (also transversely) is drawn to 
the scale of six and one-half miles to the inch. 
There are numerous inset maps on an even 
larger scale ; of these, the maps of Greater 
New York, Jersey City and Vicinity, Buffalo 
and the Niagara Frontier, Boston, Baltimore, 
Washington, Pittsburg, Savannah, and their 
respective vicinities, all on the scale of four 
miles to the inch, are handsome examples. 
Charleston and its vicinity is finely exhibited 
on a considerably larger scale ; the more com- 
prehensive map of San Francisco and her Bay 
is drawn to the scale of seven miles to the inch ; 
those of Richmond and Norfolk, and their vicin- 
ities, to the scale of eight miles ; that of Gal- 
veston and Houston to the scale of ten miles ; 
and the scales of the maps of New Orleans and 
Chattanooga are not given. The little map of 
Minneapolis and St. Paul, on the petty scale of 
eight miles to the inch, is scarcely calculated to 
satisfy either the pride of their citizens or the 
curiosity of others. It is a pity that the capital 
plan of showing the vicinities of large towns on 
a uniform scale of four miles to the inch was 
departed from in this case. In this way the 
greater compactness of European cities, and the 
enormous superficial areas covered by the newer 
cities of the Mississippi Valley are shown at a 
glance. Vienna, with its million and a third 
of inhabitants, appears to cover, on the scale of 
four miles to the inch, barely as much ground 
as is covered by Minneapolis on the scale of 
eight miles. Liverpool would go twice into 
Cleveland ; Brussels and Amsterdam are of 
contemptible size in comparison with Omaha ; 
Hamburg and Altona, as figured here on the 
scale of two miles to the inch, bulk scarcely 
bigger than the two Kansas Cities on the scale 
of four miles ; while circular London might, by 
a process of violent distortion, be packed into 
the North and South Sides of Chicago, leaving 
plenty of room on the West Side to slip Paris in 
without disturbing its oval symmetry. As fig- 
ured here on the scale of four miles to the inch, 
Paris is about the size and shape of a walnut, 
London of an enormous peach, Boston proper of 
a small strawberry, New York proper of a large 
peapod, Chicago of no known vegetable product, 
unless it be a generous slice of bread, irregu- 
larly cut and inequitably buttered, and appar- 
ently nibbled away on one side. 

By the scales permitted by the size of this 
Atlas, the great states of the Middle West, the

topography of which is for the most part so 
monotonous, can be shown with some detail. 
Thus, Indiana, with its area of 36,350 square 
miles (somewhat larger than Ireland) can be 
shown on a single map at a scale of nineteen 
miles to the inch. The state of New York (47,- 
620 square miles, somewhat smaller than 
England) is shown on the scale of sixteen miles 
to the inch, three maps being necessary, 
giving room, however, for the large inset maps 
of New York, Buffalo, etc. It is convenient, 
by the way, to bear in mind that the combined 
areas of New York and Indiana are but a little 
greater than the combined areas of England 
and Ireland, so that for purposes of comparison 
they can be regarded as the same. 

The still larger state of Illinois (56,650 
square miles) is exhibited on two of these sheets 
at a scale of eighteen miles to the inch. Inas- 
much as little is to be shown ou the map of 
Illinois save the position and names of the 
towns, the names and boundaries of the coun- 
ties, the frequent railways, and the infrequent 
streams, the scale adopted is quite unnecessar- 
ily large ; an even smaller scale would, indeed, 
have permitted the insertion of interesting fea- 
tures of the landscape, such, for example, as 
Starved Rock and Deer Park. On the map of 
Northern Illinois I discover but two contour 
lines ; one running down both sides of the 
Mississippi from Keokuk, the other running 
down both sides of the Illinois from Seneca, 
the rest of the country, including the Lake, 
being at an elevation of more than five hundred 
feet above the sea. 

The great state of California, on the other 
hand, presenting, as it does, every topograph- 
ical feature that can be shown upon a map, 
would require for even tolerable representation 
at least as large a scale as that here adopted 
for Illinois. And California is as eminently 
worthy of detailed treatment in an American 
Atlas as any state. California is said to have 
an area of 158,360 square miles, so that it 
would cut up into three and a half states of the 
size of New York, leaving a remnant more than 
large enough to form Rhode Island. It is 
about equal in extent to the four kingdoms of 
Italy, Greece, Belgium, and the Netherlands. 
The map of California must exhibit a state of 
far more diversified topographical configura- 
tion than any other. It must show intricate 
mountain-systems, with lofty, snow-clad sum- 
mits and ridges, giving rise to important streams 
which, in cutting their way to the Pacific Ocean, 
have formed a number of canons and gorges 



comparable to the well-known Yosemite Valley. 
These mountains are doubtless still rich in con- 
cealed mineral resources ; they are already 
traversed by wagon-roads and stage-routes in 
many places, and are even penetrated by more 
than one railway. In the not distant future 
they are destined to serve for Americans as a 
summer playground quite equal in all kinds of 
opportunities for seekers of health or healthful 
pleasure to the distant, tourist-haunted Alps. 
Taking account of her mountains, California 
can boast of a greater variety of climates and 
products than can be found along the Atlantic 
coast from Maine to Florida. In every respect 
save that of great population, California is 
second in interest and importance (from the 
standpoint, at least, of the student of geog- 
raphy) to no state in the Union. Yet the ed- 
itor of this Atlas has crowded her eight hun- 
dred miles of length and two hundred miles of 
breadth into a portion of two of these small 
sheets, and has adopted the scale of thirty-six 
miles to the inch, just half that adopted for 
Illinois. On this relatively minute scale it has 
been impossible for the map-maker to do jus- 
tice to this vast region of configuration so 
varied. The map lacks the clearness which is, 
in general, characteristic of this Atlas, and 
leaves much to be desired in point of detail. 
The multitudinous contour-lines are extremely 
confused, it is difficult to follow them even 
with a magnifying glass. One would gladly 
sacrifice all these puzzling lines for indica- 
tions of the principal stage-routes and other 
wagon-roads. Important post-routes in the 
United States are indicated, I believe, only on 
the maps of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, 
Utah, and Western Texas. Why not also in 
California, where the wagon-routes are so nu- 
merous, economically so important, and scen- 
ically so interesting? 

In general throughout the Atlas the plan 
seems to be to indicate wagon-roads chiefly in 
regions where there are no railroads. As has 
been already shown, this plan is not consistently 
carried out. On the map of Scotland, where 
the highways are perhaps more systematically 
shown than in the case of any other European 
country, they generally disappear before the 
railway, but in two or three instances the high- 
way is shown running amicably alongside the 
railway. In England, Wales, and Ireland, there 
are, to judge from these maps, no wagon-roads 
at all. Even in the case of the otherwise so 
satisfactory map of Central England, on the 
scale of nine miles to the inch, not a highway 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

is shown. Still worse, in the cases of several 
of the special inset maps on larger scales than 
the accompanying main maps, there are no 
highways. Examples are the maps of San 
Francisco and vicinity, of the Hudson River 
country from Kingston to Yonkers, of the 
French Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to 
Mentone. On the map of Southern France 
but one highway through the Pyrenees is shown ; 
on that of Spain, although on a much minuter 
scale, four or five are shown ; but on neither is 
there a road to the Republic of Andorra. In 
Iceland, as in Ireland, the chapter on roads 
would be like the famous chapter on snakes ; 
and the same would apply to the whole vast 
Dominion of Canada, with the sole exception, 
if I mistake not, of the Yukon and the Eraser 
River regions. On the map of Switzerland 
(drawn to the scale of fourteen miles to the 
inch) the great stage routes are indicated with 
some approach to system, although even here 
one misses, among others, the important roads 
from the Spliigen Pass and the Engadine Val- 
ley to Lake Como. On the maps of Africa 
and South America important roads or caravan 
routes are shown more clearly than in any other 
parts of the world, being printed in red, and yet 
plainly distinguishable from the railways by 
the double lines. This is so excellent a device 
that one is puzzled by its non-adoption else- 
where, especially for the Russian and the Chi- 
nese Empires. It is adopted just once, appar- 
ently by accident, on one of the American maps 
(leaving inset maps out of account), to show 
one of the roads running into the Yellowstone 
National Park. It is also adopted for the Rus- 
sian caravan routes on the map of the Chinese 
Empire. 

On the whole, this Atlas might fairly and 
without satirical intention be called a railway 
atlas of the world. Its indications of railways 
seem to be, for the most part, full, accurate, 
and " up-to-date." To this statement there are 
some noteworthy exceptions. On the map of 
the Chinese Empire a great portion of the 
Trans-Siberian Railway is indicated by a red 
dotted line as " under construction "; on the 
map of Asia the same portion (Lake Baikal 
east for hundreds of miles to Stryetensk) is 
indicated by a continuous black line, as if com- 
pleted. On Map 103 the Trans-Caspian Rail- 
way is made to run beyond Samarkand to the 
limit of the map ; it would be interesting to 
know how much farther it is completed in that 
direction. The last volume of " The States- 
man's Year-Book" (1897) mentions Samar- 



kand as the terminus, but announces the begin- 
ning of a continuation. On the map of Asia 
which, we are kindly informed, has " special 
reference to Siberia and Central Asia " (i. e., 
to Russia in Asia) this important railway is 
not given. On the map of Russia in Europe 
the branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway from 
Cheliabinsk to Ekaterinburg (150 miles), said 
in the " Statesman's Year-Book " to have been 
opened in 1896, is figured as merely "pro- 
posed "; while the proposed railroad of more 
than 600 miles from Perm to Vyatka and thence 
northward to the junction of the Dvina and the 
Vichegda the purpose of which is to give 
Western Siberia a seaport at Archangel is 
not figured at all. Considering the vast scope 
and untold significance of Russian railway un- 
dertakings, these seem grave shortcomings in 
an Atlas of such pretensions. 

As concerns the United States, the foreign 
student of this American Atlas might fairly 
draw from it the inference that we have sur- 
rendered unconditionally to the railroad. In 
these days when the universal use of the bicycle 
is making the importance of good highways so 
strongly felt, the system here adopted of ignor- 
ing their existence seems a reactionary proceed- 
ing. After all, when in search of accurate 
information touching railway lines, it is not to 
an atlas that we look, but to the railway guides 
which are distributed gratuitously at every sta- 
tion and hotel in the land. There is in this 
Atlas a convenient " Travel-Map " of Central 
Europe. Why not give us a similar travel-map 
of the United States, and on other maps replace 
the railway by the highway ? Why not pursue 
this plan universally for railway-ridden lands ? 
But this would not be a necessary condition of 
the restoration of the highway. On such maps 
as those of the New England States, for exam- 
ple, and of France, there is ample room for 
the insertion of the most important highways 
without displacing a single present feature of 
those maps. 

However, I venture to think that the Atlas 
of the Future will relegate the railway to a 
special map, will restore the slow and dignified 
highway to something of its ancient importance, 
and will lay down mountain roads and trails 
distinguished mainly for their scenical interest. 
In this way a map gets charged with appeals to 
the imagination, and allures the student to much 
fascinating fireside travel. Few things are more 
poetic than a wagon-road can be at its best, just 
as few things are more prosaic than a railroad. 
There is one map in this Atlas which is charm-

ing, ami, but for the red spider-web of railways 
that overlays it, would be poetical. I refer to 
the fine map of the Vicinity of London, really 
a map of Central England as far west as Salis- 
bury and Warwick. It is upon the generous 
scale of nine miles to the inch, showing all the 
parks in green and all the county and munici- 
pal boroughs in brown. I need not say what a 
boon such a map is to the student of history 
and the reader of literature. The Philistine 
who made this beautiful map just missed being 
a poet. Had he only been moved to leave out 
his beloved, but in this case useless and mean- 
ingless, railways, and to put in the roads and 
lanes ! For what have railways to do with 
green English parks? 

Several of the maps are of especial present 
interest. That of South Africa shows railways 
running from half a dozen points on the coast 
to the gold-fields of the Transvaal, as well as 
the long railway line of more than 1500 miles 
from Cape Town to Bulawayo. A number of 
battlefields are marked, the latest being that of 
Krngersdorp. The map of Central Africa, 
although on a much smaller scale, is not less 
interesting. It presents an almost startling 
picture of the march of colonization and of the 
international race for territory in the heart of 
the Dark Continent. The map of the Greater 
Antilles is on the scale of forty-eight miles to 
the inch, too small to show in detail the daily 
movements of the opposing forces in Cuba. 
Australia is too meagerly treated on a scale of 
two hundred miles to the inch ; and the map of 
the East Indian Islands, including the Philip- 
pines, on the same scale, is rather tantalizing 
to the student of the present war. Of especial 
historical interest are the more comprehensive 
maps, e. gr., those of Africa, of the West 
Indies, and of the Region around the North 
Pole, by means of which the routes of dis- 
coverers can be traced from the time of Co- 
lumbus to the time of Nansen. The historical 
maps proper are good as far as they go, but 
no claim for completeness can be made for 
them. Aside from the map of Britain and the 
two maps of Saxon England, there is no map 
exhibiting the political condition of the world 
during the six centuries and a half from the 
beginning of the reign of Hadrian to the begin- 
ning of the reign of Charlemagne. Aside from 
the map of England and the maps of France, 
there is no map illustrating the state of Europe 
at any time during the seven centuries between 
Charlemagne and the Reformation. Nothing 
is given in illustration of the rise and spread 



of Christianity, nor of Mohammedanism and 
the Saracen Empire, nor of the Crusades. 
Quite disproportionate attention is given to 
Poland, as much as to England or to France, 
the whole of one of these thirteen precious 
pages being devoted to her provincial history. 
It is generally supposed by historical students 
that the French Revolution and the Napoleonic 
wars, or the Rise of Prussia, or the Formation 
of the German Empire, or the Unification of 
Italy, to mention no other great movement 
left unnoticed here, is of more worldwide 
significance than the lamentable story of the 
partition of Poland. 

I have dwelt upon what seem to me the short- 
comings of this Atlas, because it is worthy of 
serious criticism. Its genuine value will com- 
mend it to so many buyers that its energetic 
publishers will be moved to revise it. The 
faults I have indicated are none of them vital. 
A considerable number of additional maps could 
be added without rendering the bulk of the 
volume either excessive or out of proportion 
with the other volumes of the great work which 
it worthily completes. Possessors of those vol- 
umes should make haste to add this one to the 
set ; they will not find it the least useful.

NATURE FOR NATURE'S SAKE.* 

When life is cheapened, as it is in these days, 
to the standards of a narrowly conceived utility, 
impressions of beauty are not easily received. 
Yet all around us, every day and hour, it waits 
in all the loveliness of perfection, urgent to 
come in. Life, by reason of our wilful ways 
and the restraints we have put upon it, has 
found itself nowhere free to work out its own 
design. It thus shows everywhere incomplete, 
blurred and weakened in outline and in form. 
Thus, that aureole of beauty which rests upon 
all perfection hovers nowhere about it, and 
only as art has reconstructed its types in their 
ideal forms does it show glorious. With na- 
ture it is not so. No wilfulness has blurred the 
lines here ; nowhere have its forms been con- 
strained to feebleness, or left unfinished. Its 
face, whether it smiles or frowns, is sad or gay, 
is always perfect in its own way. It would 
seem, then, that we could not miss this beauty 
so constant in its expression, even when lack-

ing its ministry of art ; yet somehow we do, 
perhaps because it is so constant, and so freely 
ours. Hence, it is well that someone should 
point out to us the value of this our " untaxed 
heritage," and show us how rich we are. 

In " Nature for Its Own Sake," Prof. John 
C. Van Dyke has accomplished such a task. 
The purpose suggested in the title of his book 
is more explicitly stated as follows : 

" In treating of this nature I have not considered it 
as the classic or romantic background of human story, 
nor regarded man as an essential factor in it. ... 
Nature is considered as sufficient unto itself. The forms 
and colors of this earth need no association with man- 
kind to make them beautiful." 

Beauty in its last analysis is, of course, a thing 
of the mind, a certain kind of delightful impres- 
sion left upon it, and not something to be arbi- 
trarily affirmed of that which leaves this impres- 
sion ; nor is there any implication in Mr. Van 
Dyke's book that this is not so. His object is 
simply to show how much of such delight that 
beauty gives, and may be ours if we will only 
look about us. 

Could we compare them, we should find that 
the impressions we now receive from earth and 
sky are very different from our childish ones. 
Yet it is the child who really sees nature as it 
is, and the mind, when present with its expe- 
rience and its reasons, only darkens perception. 
But this self-forgetfulness upon which all the 
truth of objective impressions depends is no 
condition of any constructive work by which we 
seek to impart them to others. In doing this, 
we must remember what we had forgotten ; we 
must use our knowledge of our subject, and 
exercise our maturer right to ask the reason 
why. Mr. Van Dyke has thus found it neces- 
sary to include in his treatment of nature's 
effects some of that science which accounts for 
them to the mind. In a word-picture of nature, 
there are two special limitations : it can give us 
only the idea of a scene, whereas a painting or 
the scene itself gives us a sensation of it ; and 
it must present the scene in a succession of 
images. We shall thus miss all of that great 
charm derived from the instant impression of 
its ensemble of color and form. Other terms 
than their own are incompetent to convey effects 
of color, for the reason that these, unlike the 
forms that mediate them, have no existence at 
all except for the eye ; and even could words 
be found to define the exact tints upon which 
the impression of harmony in nature depends, 
they would still be found a very poor substitute 
for the tints themselves. 

With this suggestion of the indescribable in 



it which is especially the painter's reason, it 
may be said that Mr. Van Dyke has seen nature 
" as it is and without prejudice," and that his 
book shows throughout a rare justness of ob- 
servation, and a mind open to all impressions 
of natural beauty. He gives us a series of pic- 
tures of earth and sky that, both in detail and 
mass, are vividly impressive and true. First he 
shows us the beauty and significance of light, 
discriminating finely the effects produced by 
its different degrees and kinds, whether broken 
or shaded, pure or reflected. He then shows 
us the sky, as we knew it of old, when it touched 
our horizon, and we had no more thoughts about 
it than had the rivers and the seas and the grass 
blades and the flower petals, and answered to 
it as obediently as they. Clouds and cloud- 
forms are next treated, and though here, as in 
the following chapter on rain and snow, consid- 
erable attention is given to the causes of the 
various appearances and effects described, the 
impression is always more of what things seem 
than of what they are, and we are constantly 
persuaded that it is better to look at them than 
to know about them. And this is always felt 
to be so ; for, although there is considerable 
analysis of the scientific kind in all of the chap- 
ters, it is the perception of beauty, and never 
the spirit of inquiry, that is quickened in us. 

For purposes of orderly arrangement, the 
earth and its appearances and effects, as dis- 
tinguished from the sky and its phases, make 
up the subject-matter of the remaining chapters. 
We are never, however, permitted to lose sight 
of what is above, nor do we ever fail to realize 
that the pitch and key of the whole harmony 
is given there. The sea illustrates this best of 
all. Some accident, as of depth or density, or 
character of its shore, are seen to enter into the 
impression of color it gives, but this impression 
is found to be mainly determined by the color 
and light of the sky. Mr. Van Dyke gives us 
a beautiful series of sea effects, closely and 
lovingly observed. He then takes us to still 
lakes bosoming their shores, and down rivers 
that sweep in long curves of beauty to the ocean. 
We see streams and rivulets and brooklets rip- 
pling to the breeze and dancing to the sunlight. 
Then he shows us the mountains and the hills, 
the plains and the lowlands, and finally their 
covering of grass and bush and tree, all with 
fine analysis, and a never-failing sense of the 
essential beauty in the effect or scene described. 

But why, it may be asked, is such a book writ- 
ten ? Why draw up such an extended category 
of colors and effects which we may all see for our-

selves ? It is because we do not see them, be- 
cause " we have fallen upon days of reflection," 
and " instead of looking without, our eyes are 
turned within while walking the new Garden 
of Hesperides." It must be remembered, fur- 
thermore, that the book is offered as an outline 
of something to be filled out later on, and does 
not purport to be in any respect a full treatment 
of its subject ; it must also be remembered that 
instruction, more than entertainment or literary 
effect, is the aim of the work. Mr. Van Dyke 
has the gift of imparting his ideas pleasantly, 
and we may go to school to him without fear 
that our interest will be overtaxed. We shall 
welcome that fuller treatment of his subject 
which is promised for the future.

"BATTLES LONG AGO."* 

If timeliness which is said to be the chief 
merit of good newspaper articles, and has been 
the only merit of many a poor one may do as 
much for a book, then Mr. Oman's bulky vol- 
ume on " The Art of War," in spite of its 
667 pages, ought to find many readers in 
America outside of the professional students of 
the art of war : for just now there are some 
fifty million amateurs among us pursuing this 
branch of study. 

The author has long been known as an inde- 
fatigable and successful worker in mediaeval 
history, as his standard history of the Byzantine 
Empire abundantly proved him to be ; but in 
the present undertaking he has begun what is 
evidently intended to be his magnum opus. If 
the other promised volumes take as much time 
and toil as have gone to the making of this, we 
can only admire the serene courage of a scholar 
who toils at the foundation of a monument 
whose cap-stone he may reasonably doubt of 
ever seeing. For our own sake, we will wish 
for Mr. Oman the fortune of a Ranke rather 
than of a Buckle. 

His field is nothing less than the history of 
the art of war, from Greek and Roman times 
down to the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
The work is planned as follows : Volume I., 
classical antiquity ; Volume II. (the one before 
us), from the downfall of the Roman Empire 
to the fourteenth century ; Volume III., the 

A HUTTOBT OF THE ART or WAR. The Middle Ages,

fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries ; 
Volume IV., the eighteenth century, including 
the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars down 
to Waterloo. From 500 B. C. to 1815 A. D. 
is a wide sweep ; and as man may be defined as 
a fighting animal, the mass of available mate- 
rial might well threaten to overwhelm both the 
historian and his bravest readers. But the 
author carefully explains in his preface that the 
history of the art of war " does not purport to 
give the complete military annals of the civil- 
ized world. Each section deals with the char- 
acteristic tactics, strategy, and military organ- 
ization of a period, and illustrates them by 
detailed accounts of typical campaigns and 
battles. There are also chapters dealing with 
the siegecraft and fortification, the arms and 
the armor, of each age." Thus defined, the 
subject assumes proportion and becomes attrac- 
tive. 

It will be observed that the present volume 
is the second in the series as planned ; and it 
may safely be assumed that Mr. Oman wrote 
it first as covering the fields with which he has 
been especially familiar. Beginning with the 
last days of the legion, he describes the reor- 
ganization of the Roman army by Diocletian 
and Constantine, and traces the growing im- 
portance of cavalry. The end of this transi- 
tional period, after which the supremacy of 
cavalry was not questioned, he fixes at the year 
378, and that bloody day on the plains of 
Adrianople when the Roman army met its most 
crushing defeat since Cannae, and a Roman 
emperor, with forty thousand of his legionaries, 
lay dead upon the field of battle. " The mili- 
tary importance of Adrianople," says Mr. 
Oman, " was unmistakable ; it was a victory of 
cavalry over infantry. The imperial army had 
developed its attack on the great laager in 
which the Goths lay encamped, arrayed in the 
time-honored formation of Roman hosts with 
the legions and cohorts in the centre, and the 
squadrons on the wings. The fight was raging 
hotly all along the barricade of wagons, when 
suddenly a great body of horsemen charged in 
upon the Roman left. It was the main strength 
of the Gothic cavalry, which had been foraging 
at a distance ; receiving news of the fight, it 
had ridden straight for the field of battle, and 
fell upon the exposed flank of the imperial 
host." The tremendous impact wedged legions 
and cohorts into one indistinguishable mass : 
they could neither fight nor fly, and were cut 
down where they stood. * Probably to his own 
surprise, the Goth found that his stout lance

and good steed would carry him through the 
serried ranks of the imperial infantry. He had 
become the arbiter of war, the lineal ancestor 
of all the knights of the Middle Ages, the 
inaugurator of that ascendancy of the horseman 
which was to endure for a thousand years." 

The early Middle Ages are then examined, 
a chapter being devoted to the arms and tactics 
of the Franks, Visigoths, and Lombards, and 
another to those of the Anglo-Saxons. Book 
III., in seven chapters, covers the period be- 
tween 768 and 1066 dates which readers will 
recognize as standing for Charles the Great and 
William the Conqueror. Book IV. traces the 
development of the Byzantine army. Book V. 
is a deeply interesting discussion of the strat- 
egy, both grand and special, of the Crusades. 
The remaining three books treat of the art of 
war in Western Europe in the days when the 
long-bow was so effective in attack, and the 
castle so supreme in defense. Then came gun- 
powder and exploded, among other things, 
the whole fabric of military science and tactics. 
But that is another story. 

All these changes are fully set forth in de- 
tailed accounts of battles, not necessarily the 
politically " decisive " ones, but those which are 
regarded as typical by the military historian ; 
though some, like Hastings and Crecy, are of 
both kinds. In most cases, the author describes 
and criticizes the strategy of both armies. His 
descriptions are graphic and almost always 
clear ; his style is never monotonous, though 
the subject lies dangerously that way. Though 
a scientific treatise, his work never would find 
place in Lamb's catalogue of biblia a-biblia : 
it is, throughout, for the reader as well as the 
student. The book is well supplied with care- 
fully prepared maps and plans, which leave the 
reader in no doubt as to the topography or ar- 
rangement. It is printed on paper which is 
provokingly thin ; and appropriately bound in 
the flaming British scarlet of her Majesty's 
uniform. JOSIAH RENICK SMITH.

and would yield many nuggets had we room for them. 
One must suffice from a letter by FitzGerald. " My

your ' Yellowplush ' the other day, not knowing who

with an air of indifference, that I knew the author well. 
They are also not quite certain but that I wrote it my- 
self, so that I gain every way." 



A NEW VIEW OF "BLOODY" JEFFREYS.* 

We commonly conceive of Judge Jeffreys as 
the monster of bloodthirsty cruelty, blasphe- 
mous rage, and brutish intemperance, which 
Macaulay represents him to have been. The 
popular historian's persuasive rhetoric easily 
carries the willing reader with him in his de- 
scription of the man whose depravity has passed 
into a proverb. Even to-day the assertion of 
Macaulay's contemporary is not without a 
measure of truth, that one has to agree with 
Tom Macaulay in the end, and it is easier to do 
so at once. Yet it must be borne in mind that 
his picture of Jeffreys's personality, graphic and 
masterly though it is, draws its colors chiefly 
from two prejudiced sources. Further char- 
acteristic of the uncritical nature of his work 
is his commendation of Campbell's " Lives of 
the Chief Justices." " I scarcely need," he 
says, " advise every reader to consult Lord 
Campbell's excellent book." 

It is interesting to conjecture in what light 
Jeffreys's character and career would have been 
handed down to us had the Tories instead of 
the Whigs prevailed in 1688. The maledic- 
tions of exultant foes might not indeed, could 
not have been displaced by the eulogies of 
friends, for warm friends he had none ; but at 
least a more accurate estimate of such abilities 
as he must have possessed would have found 
record. 

Mr. Irving's " Life of Judge Jeffreys " is a 
creditable attempt to attain historical accuracy 
in tracing the life of a most remarkable and, 
despite his infamy, most interesting man. 
Hardly a single source of information, however 
unimportant, seems to have been overlooked in 
this exhaustive study of nearly four hundred 
pages in length ; and the writer has treated his 
sources with that cautious discrimination, the 
importance of which has been so well empha- 
sized by Freeman. The official reports of state 
trials are given the prominence which their 
authenticity as contemporary evidence merits. 

The successive stages in the evolution of 
Jeffreys's peculiar genius of turpitude are care- 
fully traced. His early domestic life seems to 
have been not discreditable, to say the least, 
and we are told that in return for that impul- 
sive act of generosity which led him, at nineteen 
years, into a matrimonial alliance with a poor 
clergyman's daughter, the latter " proved a good

wife, and repaid her husband's generous act by 
constant affection and six children." The intox- 
ication of early success and popularity, and the 
insidious influences brought to bear on one who 
easily made himself a favorite at court, could not 
fail to act injuriously upon the young Welsh- 
man, possessing as he did all the excitability 
and instability of the true Celt that he was. 

Jeffreys's character has been judged by suc- 
ceeding generations without due reference to 
the corruption of the age in which he lived, the 
profligacy of the court which he served, and 
the faulty and, to us, iniquitous, judicial sys- 
tem which he was called upon to administer. 
Even Jeffreys himself and it is a circum- 
stance worth noting in his favor, though Mr. 
Irving makes no mention of it exclaimed, at 
the trial of the Rev. Thomas Rosewell, a dis- 
senting minister, that it was " a hard case that 
a man should have a counsel to defend him for 
a twopenny trespass, and his witnesses exam- 
ined upon oath ; but if he steal, commit murder 
or felony, nay, high treason, where life, estate, 
honour, and all are concerned, he shall neither 
have counsel nor his witnesses examined upon 
oath." To be sure, the abuse and insults heaped 
upon helpless prisoners by Judge Jeffreys, 
from his seat on the bench, pass all limits of 
moderation and decency ; but he was only 
adopting the usage of his times. Even Sir 
Matthew Hale, self-contained and dignified 
though he was, " thought nothing of calling a 
man, whose perjuries had excited his indigna- 
tion, a * devil.' " Moreover, it is probable that 
Jeffreys, in his character of Lord Chief Justice, 
has been handled with somewhat excessive se- 
verity by historians. Lord Campbell's frequent 
recourse to what Mr. Irving calls " historical 
inspiration " is properly censured by him. He 
farther says : 

" It is, of course, striking from the point of view of 
the popular historian to represent Jeffreys as a youthful 
Mephistopheles urging poor mortals to damnation by 
insidious counsels and lying hopes. But so much has 
been done in this way with Jeffreys that it may be 
equally interesting to reduce him to his natural propor- 
tions again. And these, physically and morally, are 
more comely than has been popularly supposed. The 
quotations so far given from his public utterances are 
quite undeserving of the heated language that has been 
bestowed indiscriminately on all portions of his career, 
and hardly justify the historical misrepresentations it 
has been his privilege to enjoy from the lavish hands of 
a successor, whose historical injustice has not even that 
sense of humour which lightens the darkest passages of 
his predecessor's misdoing." 

Despite a few exhibitions of something ap- 
proaching to warmth, as in the above, the writer 



has given us a work moderate in tone and care- 
fully considered in its views ; and while it can 
hardly be expected to modify greatly the ac- 
cepted estimate of Judge Jeffreys's character, 
yet it deserves a thoughtful perusal and cannot 
fail to meet with favor from students of English 
history. It certainly strikes a new note in the 
treatment of its theme, where others have been 
content to ring the familiar changes on the sub- 
ject of Jeffreys's iniquities. Even Mr. Gar- 
diner, probably the foremost English historian 
of the present day, appears not to question the 
correctness of the accepted opinion in the mat- 
ter. " It is true," he says, " that the law which 
he had to administer was cruel, but Jeffreys 
gained peculiar obloquy by delighting in its 
cruelty, and by sneering at its unhappy vic- 
tims." Mr. Leslie Stephen, in writing of the 
State Trials, says of Jeffreys, " He was, I dare 
say, as bad as he is painted." It is this unan- 
imity, on the part of writers treating of that 
period of English history, in accepting without 
question the popular estimate of Jeffreys's de- 
gree of turpitude for base he certainly was 
that makes the present study of his career by 
Mr. Irving a valuable contribution to history. 
The three portraits in the volume, after Knel- 
ler's paintings, show, if at all true to life, that 
Jeffreys was, to our surprise, a man of singu- 
larly handsome and prepossessing appearance.

students. And such an inference might be regarded 
as strengthened by observing that the Christian 
Literature Company exists for the purpose of sup- 
plying a popular demand for reading of this class. 
How this phase of the popular literary taste is to be 
accounted for, or how it is to be reconciled with 
seemingly contrary signs of the times, we shall not 
at present stop to consider. 

The books before us illustrate what seems even 
more remarkable, namely, the diversity of treat- 
ment of which ecclesiastical history is capable. This 
is nowhere more apparent than by a comparison of 
" The Growth of Christianity " by Mr. Crooker 
with " The Story of the Christian Church " by the 
late Dr. Crooks. It might be supposed from these 
titles that the two authors were attempting to cover 
the same historical ground. But to Mr. Crooker, 
Christianity is merely one of the great religions of 
the world, perhaps superior in many ways to the 
others, yet growing out of the historic conditions 
and unfolding by the same general laws and forces 
which had operated in the production of Judaism, 
Islam, and Buddhism. It was evolved from the 
teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Tbat teaching has 
never been understood and has been but partially 
applied. The teacher's resurrection from the dead 
is by implication, and his claim to Divinity is ex- 
pressly denied. Hence, Christianity has grown up 
upon mistakes which were made or deceptions which 
were practiced in the early ages regarding these two 
fundamental points. But why call it Christianity? 

To the mind of Dr. Crooks, on the other hand, 
Christianity was organized in the world, and its 
organization is the Church. The Church is an ex- 
ternal, visible body ; a Divine institution, having a 
Divine Founder, Jesus Christ ; a Divine life, derived 
from the Holy Spirit ; a Divine body of truth, the 
Gospel. The events related by Dr. Crooks as per- 
taining to such an organization are set forth as tend- 
ing generally to advance the determinate destiny 
thereof, which is to overspread the world. 

In the period covered by the second volume of 
Dr. Dryer's " History of the Christian Church," the 
difference between his work and that of Dr. Crooks 
is chiefly one of style. Dr. Crooks is by no means 
deficient in that regard, though his book is the re- 
vision and enlargement of lectures delivered by him 
at Drew Theological Seminary, and it is hardly to 
be expected that a book could be prepared upon the 
basis of theological lectures that would justify the 
use of the title " Story," with its popular meaning. 
Dr. Dryer, however, treats the period he has under 
review with full regard to its picturesqueness and 
wealth of dramatic action. In this respect his sec- 
ond volume excels his first, which was reviewed 
some time ago in these columns. The period is one 
in which the growth of the Papacy is the centre of 
action, and this delicate subject is treated with great 
fairness. The breadth of the author's reading is 
shown by the breadth of his treatment ; and his 
portrayal of the ages of preparation for the modern 
era is such as to awaken an interest in this subject 



in a class of readers for whom he writes. For this 
class of readers he has prepared a bibliography of 
the period that is complete. 

Of an effort to cover the field of ecclesiastical 
history in monographs upon its chief epochs, we 
have before us three of ten resulting volumes. 
Others have been already noticed in these columns. 
They all exhibit difficulties in the way of such a 
treatment of Church history. To tell what was 
required of them, Dr. Wells and Dr. Clark have 
each taken a hundred pages more than any of the 
earlier writers in the series, and two hundred more 
than some of them. The development of the Papacy 
was the chief characteristic of the Age of Charle- 
magne. It is treated by Dr. Wells less dramatically 
than by Dr. Dryer, but with greater attention to 
detail ; and as a consequence we have a more spe- 
cific account of the famous forged documents than 
is to be found elsewhere in books intended for gen- 
eral reading. To the history of the Renascence by 
Mr. Paul Van Dyke, the Rev. Henry Van Dyke adds 
an introduction, explaining why the woik was passed 
over to another after having been assigned to him. 
Had another hundred pages been added to this vol- 
ume, the reader might have been supplied with more 
facts regarding the development of University life 
and some references to the artistic revival which 
was one of the chief features of that period. As it 
is, the book furnishes an outline sketch of the His- 
tory of the Papacy from the return from Avignon to 
the Sack of Rome (1377-1527). Mr. Van Dyke's 
treatment of this period is naturally brought into 
comparison with that of Dr. Dryer. It has all the 
dramatic movement of the latter, but Mr. Van Dyke 
appears to have derived his style and choice of terms 
partly from the journalistic literature of the day, 
which is not a style suitable for historical literature. 
In the " Anglican Reformation," we find the pur- 
poses of the entire series of Epoch Histories revealed. 
Wise choice was made of Dr. Clark for this work. 
His sympathies are well known and are by no means 
disguised. It was necessary, in order to write intel- 
ligibly of the English Reformation, for him to re- 
view the entire religious history of England ; but he 
has done this so concisely as to retard but little the 
progress of the work. The Anglican Reformation 
was, on the part of those who participated in the work 
of bringing it about, the realization of an idea which 
had always, either explicitly or implicitly, been oper- 
ative in the history of the English Church and peo- 
ple. For England never recognized the right of the 
Pope to interfere in the government of her National 
Church. It was only conditionally and within cer- 
tain restrictions that she had even allowed the mem- 
bers of the Cnurch to carry any appeal to Rome. 
The claims of the Rome See were hardly heard of 
anywhere before the fourth century. Hence, the 
state of the British Church that is, the Church 
established in the British Isles probably in the sec- 
ond or even in the first century, and which had 
three Bishops at the Council of Aries A. D. 314 
has no relation to the controversies of the Ref orma-

tion. It was with the introduction of Christianity 
among the Anglo-Saxons that the influence of the 
Roman See in England began, and that influence 
increased, hut without at any time absolutely de- 
priving the Church of England of its independent 
existence. Naturally one purpose of an Anglican 
Churchman in writing of the Anglican Reforma- 
tion is to place Henry VIII. in his proper relation 
thereto. The character of Henry is such as to re- 
quire an impartial historian to deal with it. This 
Dr. Clark proves to be. " It is utterly absurd," he 
says, "to suppose that Henry's character reflects 
any disgrace or discredit upon the principles of the 
Reformation. He had no sympathy whatever with 
the reformation of doctrine, and though strongly 
anti-papal from self-interest, in his religious convic- 
tions (and we must credit him with having such in 
accord with the spirit of the age in which he lived) 
he was mediaeval and Roman." But the book sets 
forth much that is not new by any means, but apt 
to be overlooked by superficial readers who would 
dispose of the Anglican Reformation in a sentence 
or a paragraph, much that is essential to a right 
understanding of that which is to the Anglo-Saxon 
race the crowning epoch of the Church's history. 

In the History of the American Episcopal 
Church," we find an old friend in a new dress. The 
popularity which this work won for itself when it 
first appeared eight years ago, and which it never 
lost, is evidenced by the fact that it went through 
six editions before it yielded to a demand for a revi- 
sion and an extension in order that it might include 
events subsequent to the Civil War. This popu- 
larity has been due to the captivating style of Dr. 
McConnell. It has given to this book the advan- 
tage over two other histories of the American Epis- 
copal Church which have appeared since his. To be 
hypercritical, the use of a wrong name in the added 
chapters of this book may be pointed out, which 
makes a noted minister of the Episcopal Church 
Bishop of the Mexican Church, with which he prob- 
ably has but little sympathy. 

Dr. McConnell's contribution to our American 
religious historical literature is the outgrowth of a 
desire to write a history of American Christianity. 
Although there is a book before us bearing that 
title, it is but a preparatory and suggestive sketch 
of that subject, and but partially fulfils Dr. McCon- 
nell's purpose. Mr. Bacon was evidently working 
upon an assignment and under the limitations of a 
" space-filler." To reduce to a volume of 420 octavo 
pages the history of all the influences of the Chris- 
tian religion in its many and varied forms in Amer- 
ica, is no mean achievement The author pricks an 
occasional historical bubble, and puts his finger upon 
some weak spots in our religious systems ; but he is 
generally free from the expression of prejudices, 
and of all the books before us this is the one that 
breaks up ground wholly new. It is a useful and 
suggestive book, deserving of wide reading.

I! KIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Lord Charles Beresford and Mr. 
H. W. Wilson, both authorities on 
naval topics, have jointly written a 
spirited popular account of " Nelson and his Times " 
(E. & J. B. Young & Co.), that forms, all in 
all, the best and freshest as well as the most out- 
wardly attractive contribution to the literature of 
the Nelson revival, now ebbing, that has come to our 
notice. The volume is a spacious quarto, of lavish 
pictorial attractions, including a highly colored 
frontispiece showing, according to the artist's fancy, 
the great admiral landing at Copenhagen. The 
plates, we are glad to say, serve for the most part 
the end of instruction rather than mere embellish- 
ment. They have been selected and annotated by 
Mr. Edward H. Fitchew, and form a useful and 
suggestive pictorial commentary on the text. The 
caricaturists, among them Gillray and Rowlandson, 
have been freely drawn on, and the profusion of 
portraits and cuts of Nelsonian relics serve to lend 
the work the character of a memorial volume. The 
cover design, exhibiting a female figure with wings 
and a halo, and apparently pitching a laurel wreath 
like a quoit at the head of the unconscious admiral 
below, is scarcely happy ; but the material ensemble 
is pleasing on the whole, and the pictures are hand- 
somely reproduced. As to the raison d'etre of the 
work, the authors disclaim any intention of compet- 
ing with the masterly and philosophical volumes of 
Captain Mahan recently published. They have 
written for the masses of their countrymen, to whom 
those volumes are largely inaccessible, " for the 
millions of the great British democracy for whose 
prosperity and freedom, as for that of generations 
yet unborn, Nelson fought and died." The book 
has by no means, however, the flimsy and superfi- 
cial character which too often impairs or even de- 
stroys the usefulness of designedly popular histor- 
ical biographies. It is critical in spirit where 
criticism is called for ; and the writers, while paint- 
ing their hero in the glowing colors of patriotism 
and British pride in British achievement, have not 
failed to point out wherein and in what degree he 
showed himself fallible, nay, frail. The Lady 
Hamilton episode is treated tactfully yet candidly, 
and the reader is finally adjured to forget the mis- 
takes and follies of the great seaman's career, " in 
the unbounded admiration, respect, and affection 
which are due to his glorious deeds." But the inci- 
dent nevertheless lends its inevitable touch of bathos 
to every frankly-told tale of Nelson's life. Poster- 
ity, glorying in Nelson's priceless services and 
almost peerless valor, must be made to marvel at the 
sailor-like facility with which he walked into the 
net so openly spread for him by this coarse Delilah, 
who, whatever she may have been in her youth 
when Romney painted her, was grown latterly, when 
Nelson met her at Naples, a somewhat gross and 
bovine creature with " charms " suggestive of the 



1898.]

sirens of Portsmouth or Wapping. But how great 
Nelson was, in plan as in action, professionally 
viewed! Perhaps his distinguishing trait as a sea- 
man was the swift judgment or prescience which 
enabled him on occasion when a subordinate to break 
or reverse the letter of a command in order to carry 
out more surely and fully its spirit conduct bril- 
liantly justified at St. Vincent and Copenhagen, but 
certainly not to be recommended to the service as 
a precedent. Nelson fought for victory and not for 
prize-money. Sir Charles Beresford remarks: "If 
he had devoted the same energy and forethought to 
acquiring prize-money as he did to destroying his 
country's enemies, he would have become a million- 
aire." For popular reading there is no better book 
on Nelson than this. 



From 
" middy " 
to admiral. 



Rear-Admiral Sir Victor A. Mon- 
tague, a fine old sea-dog of a breed 
now vanishing, who retired from the 
Royal Navy in 1886, has written from a rather 
retentive memory a lively account of his career 
as a " midshipmite," entitled " A Middy's Recollec- 
tions " (Macmillan). Sir Victor joined the navy in 
1853, and his narrative takes us down to 1860. 
His first ship ( not technically ) was the " Princess 
Royal "; and his trials aboard this fine 91-gunner 
recall Smollett. The fare was execrable, and one 
wonders how anybody could be expected to do any 
fighting on it. A day's rations comprised " a pound 
of very bad salt junk (beef), or of pork as salt as 
Mrs. Lot, detestable tea, sugar to match, and a bis- 
cuit that was generally full of weevils, or well over- 
run by rats, or (in the hot climates) a choice retreat 
for the detestable cockroach." Thus did thrifty old 
England feed the chosen heroes of her national song 
and story the " Hearts of Oak " who manned her 
" Wooden Walls " ! No wonder that " Jack " ran 
a-muck of the proprieties when he got ashore with 
money in his pocket. On the " Princess Royal " Sir 
Victor was of course dreadfully hoaxed and bullied 
by his salter messmates. But your young Briton, 
" middy " or public-school boy, submits to bullying 
as naturally as he resorts to it when his own turn 
comes. It is part of a system supposed to foster the 
sterner virtues ; and the old adage (pleasantly con- 
troverted by Lamb) that "A bully is always a 
coward " does not apply to Young England. Of 
actual sea-fighting there is not much recorded in 
Admiral Montague's book, which is mainly a personal 
record, off-hand in style, though graphic and well- 
written. We should very much like to see a similar 
record from the hand, say, of our own Captain " Bob" 
Evans, who has recently shown, to the admiration 
of the English press, that he can write almost as 
well as he can fight. Admiral Montague saw some 
pretty exciting brushes, however, in the Crimea, in 
China, and during the Mutiny. But his naval pas- 
sages seem mere pop-gun work beside the recent 
terrible and dramatic doings at Manila and off 
Santiago. The book is neatly made and contains 
several plates, among them a brace of portraits of 



the author, the one showing him as a trim midship- 
man of fifteen, the other as an admiral of fifty or 
thereabouts, looking as taut as a backstay and as 
" salt " as Captain Cuttle. 

Biography of The biography of a modern play- 
a playwright wright " W. G. Wills, Dramatist 
andpamter. and p a } nter (Longmans) pre- 

sents the pathetic figure of a man who succeeded in 
a secondary field, and failed in the work of his 
choice. Though eminently fortunate in his dramas, 
Mr. Wills, it is said, would have given all his dra- 
matic laurels for one success in painting or in that 
form of it which he elected. As an artist in pastel, 
he was successful, to the point of popularity and 
even to that of royal favor; but in oil-painting, 
which he believed to be his gift and his ultimate 
career, he achieved nothing. " I am," he said once, 
" a poor painter who writes plays for bread "; yet 
it was by his plays alone that he attained distinction, 
though this will hardly reach the point of justify- 
ing the claim made for him by his biographer, Mr. 
Freeman Wills, of the place of " poetic dramatist of 
the Victorian era." He was the first among modern 
English playwrights to make familiar and popular 
such poetic work as his " Charles I." and " Olivia"; 
and it was because of his genius for such work that 
he was commissioned by Mr. Irving to write the 
memorable " Lyceum ' Faust '" an adaptation 
which was awaited with much eagerness, received 
much praise and blame, and has been acted, we are 
told, a greater number of times than any modern 
drama. Here and there in the book is given 
without especial awkwardness some noteworthy 
opinion of his plays, the most interesting being a 
criticism, by George Henry Lewes, upon " The Man 
i' Airlie " " a tragedy," the critic said, " of which 
a great poet might be proud." The biographer, 
though admirably candid, is at times diffuse and 
at times sentimental ; however, he has written a 
readable book, dealing with subjects unhackneyed 
in the literary world, and showing the dramatist 
and painter as a very fine and lovable personality. 



A pudding 
ttuffed with 

plums. 



Mr. Squeers's rapturous ejaculation, 
" Here 's richness ! " aptly applies to 
the volume of " Collections and Rec- 
ollections " (Harper), by an unnamed diarist and 
raconteur said by the reviewers who have been 
making free with his plums to be none other than 
Mr. G. W. E. Russell. The book is a delightful 
one as good as Greville or Lenox ; and if there be 
a dull page we have certainly failed to hit it. Its 
contents are as multifarious as rich. The author's 
jottings range over a space of seventy-five years, 
and consist partly of traditions and anecdotes gath- 
ered from people and books, partly of matter of 
personal recollection. There is a pleasant leaven 
throughout of the shrewd, gently cynical philosophy 
of a good-tempered and still nnjaded man of the 
world. That the writer is a neat hand at a pen- 
portrait or a character study, the chapters on Lords

RoMell, Houghton, and Shaf tesbui y. and on Cardi- 
nal Manning, especially attest. The slightly mali- 
cious note on Mr. Lowell will interest the American 
reader. It was in 1872, before Mr. Lowell began 
his diplomatic career, that the author met him, in a 
company of tourists " doing " Durham Castle, as it 
chanced. " Though I was a devotee of the ' Biglow 
Papers,' I did not know their distinguished author 
even by sight ; and I was intensely amused by the 
air of easy mastery, the calm and almost fatherly 
patronage, with which this cultivated American 
overrode the indignant show-woman; pointed out 
for the general benefit of the admiring tourists the 
gaps and lapses in her artistic, architectural, and 
archaeological knowledge ; and made mnllion and 
portcullis and armor and tapestry the pegs for a 
series of neat discourses on mediaeval history, do- 
mestic decoration, and the science of fortification." 
The writer goes on to say that in later years he 
found that his oppressively well-informed volunteer 
cicerone of Durham Castle, " though an accom- 
plished politician, a brilliant writer, and an admir- 
able after-dinner speaker, was, conversationally 
considered, an inaccurate man with an accurate 
manner " which is a rather neat characterization, 
whatever one may think of its accuracy in the par- 
ticular case. A good thing is recorded of Welling- 
ton. Mrs. Norton once requested permission to 
dedicate a song to him, whereupon the alarmed war- 
rior refused, pleading that he had been obliged to 
make it a rule to decline all dedications, " because, 
in his situation as Chancellor of Oxford University, 
he had been much exposed to authors" Mr. Rus- 
sell's book (if his it be) is one of the freshest and 
raciest of its kind. 



tm Arktauaw The latest example of the current 
u the Rockut vogue of Western history is furnished 
by the new series of " American Ex- 
plorers," edited by Dr. Elliott Coues and published 
by Mr. Francis P. Harper, of which No. 1 is entitled, 
for short, " The Journal of Jacob Fowler." It nar- 
rates an adventure, in 1821-22, from Arkansaw 
through the Indian Territory, Oklahoma, Kansas, 
Colorado, and New Mexico, to the sources of Rio 
Grande del Norte. The editor, in his too short 
introduction, tells us who Major Fowler was, and 
recites the history of his manuscript, which he 
entitled " Merorandom of the Voige by land from 
fort Smith to the Rockey Mountains." On this point 
it suffices to say that it belongs to the rich store 
of Americana collected by Col. II. T. Durrett of 
Louisville, Kentucky, the accomplished president of 
the Filson Club. Major Fowler, born in New York 
in 1765, came to Kentucky in early life to carry on 
the profession of a surveyor, and made his home in 
the neighborhood of Covington. His reputation 
was that of an accomplished surveyor, and he did 
much work in this line for the national government. 
" His surveying," says Colonel Durrett, " extended 
to the great plains and mountains of the far west, 
before civilization had reached those distant wilds. 



He was there when wild animals and wilder sav- 
ages were the only tenants of the wilderness." The 
editor points out the Major's place in the history of 
the exploration of the vast region extending from 
the Missouri to the Rio Grande. Wherever other 
American trappers and traders may have gone on 
the Arkansas, or even the Rio Grande, in those 
days, Fowler was the first to forge another sound 
link in the chain which already reached from Pike 
to Long." This he did just before the Sante FY 
Trail became plainly marked, both on the face of 
the country and in Southwestern history. The book 
has a certain pedagogical value, as it shows that a 
man grossly ignorant of the language-arts can be a 
man of sound faculties and great practical talents. 
The poor character of Fowler's literary education is 
shown by every sentence in the book. If Dr. Coues 
had added to his introduction two or three pages 
more, stating what was Fowler's equipment for his 
" voige," and what was his object in making it, he 
would have done the reader a service, not leaving 
him to infer those things from the narrative itself. 
The editing and the mechanical execution of the 
volume are those with which the reader of the ex- 
cellent " Lewis and Clark," " Pike," and Henry 
and Thompson " volumes is already familiar. 

Tto legendary " Hamlet in Iceland " is the attrac- 
n.imiet of tive title of a work prepared by the 

the Noremm. ,, industrious scholarship of Mr. Israel 
Gollancz, and published by Mr. David Nutt as 
Volume III. of the " Northern Library." The two 
preceding volumes of the series are Mr. Sephton's 
translation of " The Saga of King Olaf Tryggwa*en" 
and Professor York Powell's translation of " The 
Tale of Thrond of Gate." All Shakespearian stu- 
dents know that the Hamlet story is to be found in 
the twelfth-century chronicle of the Danish his- 
torian Saxo Grammaticus, but few are aware that 
even in Saxo's time Hamlet had for centuries been a 
legendary hero of the Norsemen. The first trace of 
the name that we have come upon is preserved in 
a fragment of verse quoted by Snorri, and attributed 
to one Snaebjflrn, who lived in the tenth century. 
Even in Saxo's time, a considerable mans of legend 
had grown up about the name of Hamlet, although 
nothing of this intervening literature has been pre- 
served. Saxo took up this material, and embodied 
it, with accretions from his readings in Livy, in the 
story with which all students of Shakespeare's 
" Hamlet " are familiar. But in some lens sophis- 
ticated form the legend probably survived in the 
Icelandic consciousness down through the Middle 
Ages, for the seventeenth -century historian Tor- 
faeus, in his " Series Regum Danisa," wrote of it as 
follows : " As regards Sazos Amlethun, as a boy at 
home in Iceland I frequently heard the story of 
Amlode told by wretched old crones, but I regarded 
it as merely an old wives' tale ; later on, however, 
when I came across Saxo's noble account of the 
hero, I abandoned my boyish notion, and thence- 
forth left my friends no peace, but worried them to

find out for me the old story I had once heard, yet 
without success. At last, a few years ago, they sent 
me a story of Aralode, but no sooner had I perused 
it than I cast it aside, as altogether worthless and 
quite modern. It actually makes Hamlet not a Dane 
but a Spaniard ! It must have been composed after 
the time of the Scythian Tamberlaine, for some of 
the details are certainly derived from this history." 
The manuscript of which Torfaeus thus slightingly 
speaks is preserved in Copenhagen, and is substan- 
tially identical with the " Ambales Saga " of which 
text and translation form the principal contents of 
the volume now before us. This work, dated circa 
1600 is of great interest, and we are glad to have 
it printed, as it now is, together with extracts from 
a number of ballad-cycles and rhyming versions 
obviously based upon it. Mr. Gollancz has done his 
editorial work very thoroughly, providing not only a 
lengthy and learned introduction, but also a mass 
of illustrative matter, such as the rhymed passages 
already mentioned, selections from several allied 
sagas, from Saxo in both Latin and Low German, 
and from the modern Icelandic translation of the 
Hamlet " according to Shakespeare. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In " The Evolution of the College Student " (Cro- 
well), a booklet by President William DeWitt Hyde, 
we have " no dry essay or discussion of abstract princi- 
ples, but a study in the form of imaginative letters pass- 
ing between a living college student and his family and 
friends. The hero, Clarence Mansfield, opens his heart 
to his father and mother, and his friend and sweetheart 
Helen, at Willoughby College. Religious life at college, 
literary studies, thoughtless pranks, athletics, philos- 
ophy, college settlements, choice of a profession, the 
relations of labor and capital, are the topics that the 
young man discusses from the varying standpoint of his 
onward growth." 

The following classical text-books are published by the 
American Book Co.: " Latin Prose Composition," based 
on Caesar, Nepos, and Cicero, by Messrs. Charles C. 
Dodge and Hiram A. Tuttle, Jr.; M. Tullii Ciceronis 
La-dins de Amicitia," edited by Professor John K. Lord; 
" Greek Prose Composition," by Mr. Henry C. Pearson; 
and " Plato's Apology of Socrates and Crito, and a part 
of the Pbaedo," edited by the Rev. C. L. Kitchel. 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish " The Republic 
of Plato with Studies for Teachers," by Dr. William 
Lowe Bryan and Miss Charlotte Lowe Bryan. 

Mr. Calvin S. Brown, of the University of Tennessee, 
has done a useful piece of work in editing, with suitable 
annotations, a volume of "The Later English Drama" 
(A. S. Barnes & Co.). It has been his object " to pre- 
sent in convenient and accessible form what has been 
done best in the English drama from the time of Gold- 
smith to the present." Six plays are included in his 
plan, Sheridan's two comedies and Goldsmith's one, the 
" Virginius " of Sheridan Knowles, and the two peren- 
nial plays of Lord Lytton. We are particularly glad 
to have the text of " Richelieu " thus presented, for it 
is better literature to read than most people suppose. 



IjITERART NOTES. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons send us " The Mon- 
astery," forming two volumes in the " Temple " edition 
of Scott's novels. 

" St. Luke and St. Paul," in two volumes, are issued 
by the Macmillan Co. in The Modern Reader's Bible," 
edited by Mr. R. G. Moulton. 

The State," an address by Mr. L. T. Chamberlain 
before the Patria Club of New York, is published in 
booklet form by the Baker & Taylor Co. 

Volume VII. of " The Spectator," in the pretty new 
edition of Mr. G. Gregory Smith, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Mrs. Margaret Collier Graham, whose stories of Cali- 
fornia life are of the best that have been produced, has 
become associate editor of the " Land of Sunshine," at 
Los Angeles. 

It is announced by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
that the authorized " Life and Letters of Eugene Field " 
will be prepared by Mr. Slason Thompson, of Chicago, 
and published by that house. 

Miss Mary Wright Plummer's " Hints to Small Libra- 
ries " is published in a revised edition by Messrs. Trus- 
love & Comba, New York. It is an excellent and useful 
book, even if it does slip now and then, as in calling 
THE DIAL a weekly publication. 

The Werner Co. publish a new and enlarged edition 
of Professor James A. Harrison's " Spain in History," a 
work that is historically valuable and written in the 
most attractive style. The closing chapter comes down 
to the confinement of Admiral Cervera's fleet in the 
harbor of Santiago de Cuba. 

" The Critic " makes a good start in its new career 
as a monthly magazine, with its issue for August. Pic- 
tures are evidently to be a chief feature ; the " Lounger " 
department of literary chit-chat is extended, and put at 
the front; and a good variety of other timely matter 
makes up an attractive literary melange. 

George Eliot's " " Silas Marner," edited by Miss 
R. Adelaide Witham; Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner," 
edited by Mr. Lincoln R. Gibbs; and Milton's "Para- 
dise Lost," Books I. and II., edited by Dr. Homer B. 
Sprague, are the latest volumes in the " Standard En- 
glish Classics," published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

We regret exceedingly the demise, or at least the 
suspension, of that admirable paper " The Citizen," 
which has been published in Philadelphia for several 
years past. Its aims were high, and it pursued them 
with unfailing dignity and sobriety during the term of 
its existence. It was a civilizing agency in the best 
sense, and we trust that its resuscitation may yet prove 
possible. 

The American School of Classical Studies in Rome will 
award three fellowships (of five hundred and six hundred 
dollars each) for the year 1899-1900. These fellow- 
ships, and all the privileges of the School, are open to 
women as well as to men. The examinations will be 
held next March, and copies of the circular of informa- 
tion may be had from Professor Minton Warren, of the 
Johns Hopkins University. 

The report that Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, in col- 
laboration with Mr. Paul Lawrence Dunbar, is engaged 
in writing a comic opera is entirely without foundation. 
The " Homestead " edition of Mr. Riley 's works, in ten 
volumes, which Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish 



110 



among their subscription sett, will be complete with the 
volume issued in September. The Boweo-Merrill Com- 
pany, his regular publishers, will issue this fall The 
Golden Tear," a volume of Riley selections, compiled 
bj Miss Clara . Laughlin. 

A new edition, revised and enlarged, of Mr. Edgar 
Stanton Maclay's History of the United State* Nary," 
in two volumes, has just been published by M easts. 1). 
Apple ton & Co. Our extended review of this work at 
the time of its first appearance makes unnecessary any 
farther comment, beyond mention of the fact that the 
history has been supplemented by several new chapters, 
and brought strictly down to date. 

Mr. Austin F. Apgar's " Birds of the United States 
East of the Rocky Mountains," just published by the 
American Book Co., is " a manual for the identification 
of species in hand or in the bush," and, in spite of the 
many excellent bird-books published during the past 
few years, still finds a place waiting for it. The work 
is abundantly illustrated, and supplied with all the need- 
ful keys, indexes, and description of ornithological terms. 

Messrs. Doubleday & McClure expect to have ready 
September 1, General Miles 's book on " Military Eu- 
rope," the result of his official visit abroad at the time 
of the late Greek War. Books on war subjects and 
characters are likely to be a feature of the fall publica- 
tions, the same firm announcing, in addition to the above, 
" Our Nary in the Philippines," by Mr. John T. Mc- 
Cutcheon, with illustrations by the author; " A Gunner 
Aboard the Yankee," a boy's book about our late war; 
and Mr. Hamlin Garland's Life of General Grant. 
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. announce Mr. Dana's " Rec- 
ollections of the Civil War," and a Life of Admiral 
Porter, by Mr. James R. Soley; while Messrs. H. S. 
Stone & Co. have nearly ready The Spanish-American 
War as Seen by Eye-witnesses." 

Gorg Moritz Ebers, Egyptologist and writer of his- 
torical romance, died at his home near Munich on the 
eighth of this month, at the age of sixty-one. Born at 
Berlin, March 1, 1837, the son of a banker, who died 
before the child saw the light, he was educated at first 
by his mother, and afterwards studied at Gottingen. 
He at first took up jurisprudence, but oriental studies 
soon claimed his attention, and, following Lepsins and 
Brngsch, he devoted himself to the history of ancient 
Egypt In 1865 he became a decent at Jena, and in 
1870 was called to a professorship at Leipzig, a post 
which he held until 1889. A paralytic stroke in 1876 
turned him from the more strenuous work of scholar- 
ship into the path of a writer of historical fiction, in 
which he had won fame as early as 1864 with " Eine 
Aegyptische Koenigstochter," which remains almost, if 
not quite, the best of his many novels. Other works of 
this class were " Uarda," " Homo Sum," Die Schwes- 
tern," Der Kaiser," Serapis," Kleopatra," Die 
Xilbraut," Per Aspera," " Die Gred: Roman aus dem 
Alten Nurnberg," " Die Frau Bnrgermeisterin," " Im 
Blauen Hecht," and Arachne," published a few weeks 
ago. His works of scholarship include the discovery 
and editing of the " Papyrus E," Aegypten in Wort 
und Bild," Durch Gosen und Sinai," and " Palastina 
in Wort und Bild." His historical novels have been 
very popular, although they never succeeded in produc- 
ing a really vital reconstruction of the life and civiliza- 
tion with which they were concerned. The author's 
powers of characterization were defective, and his ro- 
mances were unduly weighed down by their wealth of 
historical and archological detail.

Old South Leaflets on Indian History. 

"THERE are three leaflets in the series relating to this 
* period of our history, the first part of John Eliot's 
Indian Grammar, Eliot's "Brief Narrative of the Prog- 
ress of the Gospel among the Indians," 1670, and Whee- 
lock's " Narrative of the Design and Progress of the 
Indian School in Lebanon, Connecticut " (the school 
which was finally merged in Dartmouth College), 1762. 
To these are now added two more Nos. 87 and 88 of 
this series, the first giving the chapters upon the Man- 
ners and Customs of the Indians, from Morton's famous 
New England Canaan, 1637, the other the account of 
the Beginning and the End of King Philip's War, pub- 
lished at the close of the war, in 1677.

DOUBLEDAY & McCLURE CO.'S BOOKS 



A NEW FALL CATALOGUE. 
We have prepared between fifty and sixty 
new books for Fall publication. It is impos- 
sible to describe them in an advertisement, 
and our purpose is to get these catalogues into 
the hands of all readers of THE DIAL. Send 
us your name and one will be forwarded. 

BOOKS ON APPEOVAL. 
We have made a success of the plan of 
sending our publications on approval to be 
paid for if satisfactory, or returned and no 
offense. Our wish is to give to the " mail 
order reader," who lives far from a book 
store, the same or better opportunity to exam- 
ine our books than the dweller in New York. 
Send for any book that interests you : remit 
after examination. 

THE NEW DOLLAR NOVEL SERIES. 
In this series we have undertaken the task 
of publishing, at the rate of one or more a 
month, a novel "good to read," a book of 
plot and incident, indeed the sort of story 
one lays down unwillingly and returns to with 
eagerness. The first volume of the series is 
"The Lady of Castle March," by OWEN 
RHOSCOMYL, author of " Battlement and 
Tower," " The Jewel of Ynys Galon." It is 
a book which will not be left half read. 

BIRD NEIGHBORS " AGAIN. 

Among the reports of the best selling books 
throughout the summer was " Bird Neigh- 
bors," by Neltje Blanchan, introduced by John 
Burroughs. The fifty-two colored plates are 
the most beautiful bird pictures ever printed 
color photography perfected at last. None 
of the popular novels sold faster. The fourth 
edition (15th thousand) is going off rapidly 
now. 

"HOW TO BUILD A HOME." 
Many people are building now. They need 
this practical book. It will be sent on ap- 
proval. 11.00. 



CONAN DOYLE'S " SONGS OF 
ACTION." 

These poems have the true swing and rush, 
and deal with war and adventure. The Lon- 
don Times in an advance notice says : " These 
songs ought rapidly to become popular. Read- 
ers of ' The White Company ' and some other 
books of his are well aware that he can write 
songs, and the present volume will pleasantly 
remind them of the happy hours which they 
spent over that thrilling romance." 

SPECIFICATIONS: Size, 5x7; Pages, 162; Bind- 
ing, silk basket-cloth, gold stamping; Type, 12-point; 
Price, $1.25. 

GENERAL NELSON A. MILES'S NEW 

BOOK, "MILITARY EUROPE." 
It is by good fortune that the last pages 
of this book were finished just as General 
Miles left for the front. In every way the 
book is timely and important as the result of 
the General's studies in Europe last year. 
The volume is beautifully illustrated, and ap- 
peals to that great audience now more inter- 
ested in military matters than ever before. 

SPECIFICATIONS: Size, 8 x 10 ; Pages, 150; Bind- 
ing, decorated cloth; 50 illustrations; Type, 12-point; 
Price, $1.50. 

A KLONDIKE BOOK BY EDWARD 

S. ELLIS. 

The author of so many famous boys' books 
(the Deerfoot Series and the Log Cajbin Series 
among others) has written a book entitled 
" Klondike Nuggets, and How Two Boys 
Secured Them." Orson Lowell has made the 
pictures.

This volume completes Mr. Taylor's treatise, which 
is the only work written on this entire subject. It is of

The plot is ingenious but probable, the characters inter-

CO UNT TOLSTO Y. 

We shall come, early in the present month, 
to the seventieth birthday of the great Kassiau 
whose name stands at the head of this article, 
and whose preeminence among the writers of 
his country now living is indisputable. More 
than this, we may say that his name could not 
fairly be omitted from a list of the half dozen 
greatest writers now living anywhere in the 
world. The other names in such a list would 
perhaps be those of Ruskin, Swinburne, Bjorn- 
son, Ibsen, and Carducci. Other names might 
possibly be substituted, with good reason, for 
one or two of these ; but, however such a list 
were constituted, it would illustrate in a strik- 
ing manner the shifting of the centre of intel- 
lectual gravity from the South to the North, 
from the Latin races to those of Teutonic and 
Slavonic origin. When Hugo and Renan were 
living, to name no others, the balance was more 
evenly held ; but now the great Italian poet 
alone stands in anything like the first rank, 
having for his peer no other Italian, no Span- 
iard, and even no Frenchman. 

Returning, after this brief digression, to our 
main subject, we feel bound to emphasize the 
opinion, often expressed in these pages, that 
Russian literature is adorned by one artistic 
personality even more important than that of 
Count Tolstoy. In the work of Tourguenieff 
the art of fiction seems to have made its longest 
reach towards absolute supremacy of achieve- 
ment. There is something almost despairing 
in the perfection, the finality, the triumph of 
the man who created * Spring Floods " and 
" On the Eve." From the structural point of 
view, the best work of Count Tolstoy, rich as 
it is in experience, in sympathy, in psycholog- 
ical truth and noble idealism, seems rude in 
comparison with those masterpieces. The gen- 
erous dying message of the elder novelist, en- 
joining the " great writer of our Russian land " 
to return to his literary labors, must not blind us 
to the fact that an even greater writer sent the 
message as he neared the close of his own career. 
As all the world knows, the plea was unheeded 
by its recipient ; for the same year (1877) had 
marked the completion of both Tourguenieff's 
" Virgin Soil " and Count Tolstoy's " Anna 
Karenina," that is, of the last significant 



122 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



artistic production of each of the two great 
writers concerned. The younger man refused 
to carry on the torch that was offered to his 
hand, seeking instead lights that seemed to him 
more trustworthy, but that were destined to 
lead his steps far astray into the morasses of 
mysticism. We trust that this expression may 
not seem too harsh to those of his disciples 
whose lives have been lifted to a higher ethical 
plane by the example of his great renunciation ; 
but we believe that art, with its implicit teach- 
ing, acts more effectively upon conduct, in the 
long run, than do any of the devices of formal 
didacticism. 

Discerning readers of "Anna Kaienina" 
could hardly escape the signs of a crisis in the 
life of its author. While a very deep sort of 
penetrative insight was displayed in the delin- 
eation of most of the characters of the novel, 
that of Levine the most important ethically, 
although not the most brilliant seemed to 
exhibit a more complete sincerity than the 
others ; and it was evident that the story of his 
restlessness, his perplexity, and his provisional 
solution of the difficult problem of existence, 
must be taken in some sense as the author's 
own spiritual autobiography. Levine's last 
words are extremely significant. 

" I shall probably continue to get out of temper with 
my coachman, to go into useless arguments, to air my 
ideas unseasonably. I shall always feel a barrier be- 
tween the sanctuary of my soul and the soul of other 
people, even that of my wife; I shall always be holding 
her responsible for my annoyances, and feeling sorry 
for it directly afterwards. I shall continue to pray 
without being able to explain to myself why I pray ; but 
my inner life has won its liberty; it will no longer be at 
the mercy of events, and every minute of my existence 
will have a meaning sure and profound which it will be 
in my power to impress on every single one of my ac- 
tions, that of being good." 

In giving these words to the character whose 
inner life most clearly reflected his own, the 
author made only too evident the preoccupations 
that were even then absorbing the greater share 
of his intellectual energies, and it was as a 
natural consequence of this state of mind that 
he set about the production of that remarkable 
series of religious writings studies in applied 
socialism and simplified Christianity that 
have been put forth during the past score of 
years, and have attracted a wider, if less dis- 
criminating, attention than was ever at the 
command of his books that really belonged to 
literature. 

It was at the same age, and under similar 
conditions of mental and emotional stress, that 
the greatest of living Englishmen turned his 



back upon a brilliant past, and determined 
henceforth to devote himself to the preaching 
of ethical truth, and the betterment, by effective 
practical example, of his fellow-men. In the 
case of Mr. Ruskin, as in that of Count Tolstoy, 
there was the same fervor of conviction, the 
same prophetic fire, the same iconoclastic zeal, 
and, we are regretfully constrained to add, the 
same essential futility of the means by which 
the regeneration of society was to be accom- 
plished. Neither the road-making of the one 
nor the shoe-cobbling of the other could cause 
more than a ripple upon the social waters that 
needed to be so deeply stirred, and in both 
cases there was inculcated the false notion that 
because the simplest things are worth doing 
well the rarest powers of genius are best em- 
ployed in showing how these simple things 
should be done. It is the earlier and not the 
later work of both men that will have the saner 
and more enduring influence, because, while no 
less fine in spirit than the later work, it is also 
done upon the terms of art and is allied with 
the everlasting power of beauty. There is, 
indeed, something almost blasphemous in the 
words with which both these men speak of the 
great work of their earlier life, in the lan- 
guage with which Mr. Ruskin scornfully char- 
acterizes as " fine writing " those pages of his 
own that first gave to so many readers the vis- 
ion of the world of natural beauty, in the vehe- 
mence with which Count Tolstoy, in the very 
latest of his books, rejects the ministry of the 
divinest forms of art that the ages have be- 
queathed to us. 

But, in spite of himself, and in spite of his 
own condemnation of the work done by him in 
the days that he now looks back upon as mi re- 
generate, Count Tolstoy has won a high place 
among the great writers of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, and won it by that work which now, en- 
gaged as he is in a futile religious and social 
propaganda, seems to his perverted vision so 
comparatively unimportant. When his living 
personality shall have passed from the view of 
men, when his tracts and his parables and his 
religious polemics shall have taken their place 
in the intellectual lumber-room which contains 
the vagaries of great souls gone astray, when 
his autobiographical writings shall be valued 
only as curious revelations of a mind out of 
joint, he will be remembered and admired and 
extolled as the author of " War and Peace,** 
that epic of the Russian people in the most 
tragic hour of its consciousness ; of " Anna 
Kardnina," that sincere and poignant portrayal 



1898.] 



THE DIAL,

of a group of intensely human souls ; by the 
slighter and earlier sketches of the Crimean 
War and the Cossacks and the Caucasus that 
exhibit in some respects a finer art than the 
two colossal productions by which he is best 
known. Recognition of the defects of these 
works will, in the long run, be fairly balanced 
by recognition of their power and their insight, 
and upon the world-wide fame that they have 
won during the last ten or twelve years will 
be set the seal of the approving judgment of 
posterity. Men will smile at the color-blindness 
of his sesthetic writings, and at the pathetic 
lack of the historical sense so characteristic of 
his social and religious philosophy, but they 
will have only respect and wonder for his 
achievements during the years before he set 
about the hopeless task of reforming the world. 
Even in the least permanently valuable work 
of so masterful a spirit there is, however, matter 
for reflection ; and a uniform English edition, 
by competent translators, of the entire writings 
of Count Tolstoy, would be a desirable under- 
taking for some enterprising publisher. Al- 
though most of his books have been put into 
English, the translations make a heterogeneous 
collection, both in appearance and efficiency ; 
their mechanical form at present too often 
arouses distaste, and their execution as trans- 
lations too often excites the suspicion that ideas 
have been inaccurately reproduced or omitted 
altogether. It would be very fortunate if the 
complete works of Count Tolstoy were made 
accessible in an English form above reproach 
as to their external parts, and deserving of full 
confidence as to their translation. 



TIME-GUAGE IN LETTERS. 



Homer's Chapman (to reverse the phrase of Keats) 
takes occasion, at the close of the Twelfth Book of 
the Odyssey, to remark, in the tongue most familiar 
to him, Opus novem dierum. This comment we are 
to understand as a mild and justifiable boast of good 
work done quickly. The Elizabethan period, to 
which the author just cited belonged, has long been 
accepted as the epoch of greatest mental activity 
known to English literature. Yet throughout that 
period, the affectation on the part of writers (if 
affectation there were) was that of inspiration rather 
than of plodding as though their motto had been 
Currente Calamo. 

Of course, to primitive people there is something 
fascinating in the very fact of improvisation ; to 
them, in every man of genius not only is there an 
eye in a fine frenzy rolling, but the genius, to be 



consistent, must be instantaneously, rather than 
laboriously, creative. Even in the early part of the 
present century, it was the effort of the approving 
biographer to maintain that what his subject did he 
not only did well but did rapidly. Bis dat qui cito 
dat was then a motto of universal acceptance. 
O'ConnelPs definition of oratory, as the faculty of 
thinking on one's legs, is in the same vein. This 
cultus of the off-hand and inspirational naturally 
had its dissenters ; hard-headed, practical observers, 
who with half-closed eyes would remind the tyro 
that there is " no excellence without great labor," 
or, more briefly still, that " easy writing is d d 
hard reading." Still, youthful enthusiasm, even in 
a biographer, was not to be denied ; and the minds 
of our ancestors were fed with tales of how Lope 
de Vega wrote one of his thousand plays in a single 
forenoon, and was found watering his flowers at 
midday, declaring that this last exertion had tired 
him considerably ! (This on the word of Prescott.) 

In earlier days, swift workmanship was part and 
parcel of the poet's equipment. Hence we are 
gravely told, on the highest authority, that Byron 
wrote " The Corsair " at ten sittings, the entire time 
scarce occupying three weeks. Of like marvellous 
celerity was the writing of " The Siege of Corinth," 
achieved while dressing for a ball. Of " The Bride 
of Abydos," disinterested biographers declared that 
the poet wrote it in a single night, without once 
mending his pen ; and, in proof thereof, that same 
un-mended pen was placed on exhibition in a glass 
case, among other curios ! Macaulay, to whom we 
are indebted for these instances, goes on to remark 
that swiftness of execution, while it by no means 
furnishes an excuse for that which is done badly, 
does certainly give an added interest to a master- 
piece. 

When men attain notoriety, the public rushes to 
confirm that notoriety. Tales of the marvellous in 
illustration of the favorite's prowess pour in from 
every source ; some from pure love of the subject, 
but most from absolute love of the marvellous for its 
own sake. Byron is only one of numerous instances 
in which the assumption of a miraculous gift of 
speed was used to quicken interest in an author's 
work. In France the same influence was at work 
at the same period, and it probably reached its acme 
in the stories of the wonderful fecundity of Alex- 
ander Dumas. Not until suit was brought against 
the author of u Monte Cristo " by various real or 
pretended collaborators, did the public awake to 
the fact of Dumas's composite authorship. It then 
became notorious that he kept a corps of authors to 
work out his ideas. Thus, the author gained in rep- 
utation for astuteness, for business sagacity but 
the marvel was no more. 

This fad of superhuman velocity has had its reac- 
tion. Now-a-days, almost all interviews with cele- 
brated authors chronicle the fact that their subjects 
are hard-working men ! In dealing with the latest 
production of that most sensational and voluminous 
of our authors, Mr. Hall Caine, publishers and 



124 



THE DIAL, 



[Sept. 1, 



reviewers proclaimed not only the years of labor 
which the work had consumed, bat the fact that 
before being committed to the press the author had 
wholly rewritten the book, with painstaking correc- 
tions and amendments. Had the fashion of Byron's 
day still prevailed, Mr. Hall Caine is just the man 
to have written the whole of it, under oath, in forty- 
eight hoars ! 

The prefaces of works published half a century 
ago almost always referred to the difficulties en- 
countered in their production by the author. Other 
avocations, political necessity, and even bereave- 
ment, were frequently cited as compelling a brief 
desultory period of industry, as when Arthur 
apologizes for his " Successful Merchant," its short- 
comings, even its etiology, by affirming a season of 
" long involuntary leisure." When Thomas Moore, 
in his preface to " Lalla Rookh," observed that in 
justice to his own industry he felt obliged to men- 
tion the long and laborious reading he undertook to 
secure the necessary local color, the critics con- 
temptuously remarked that the poet had better keep 
such details to himself ! Nowadays, the author's 
preface will usually give assurance of conscientious 
toil in which no pains have been neglected to achieve 
the requisite accuracy and finish. The minutiae of 
the workshop are unflinchingly set forth in maga- 
zines, of ton accompanied by pictures wherein the au- 
thors are represented as hard at work : Mr. Howells 
glued to a desk driving his pen with great redund- 
ancy of cuff; Mr. Barry, in brown study, stands 
with his hands in his pockets ; while Mr. Kipling 
stares superciliously at us through the largest spec- 
tacles that ever ornamented presbyopic genius. 

The author of former days said, in effect : " Look 
at me. I pour forth my rhapsodies, from pure 
inspiration. And this is genius." The author of 
the present day seems to say (with an eye on the 
other) : " Look at me. I pretend to no unusual 
powers. To me, as to Lord Bacon, Genius is pa- 
tience ; or, as another has put it, the art of taking 
pains." Of these two extreme methods as regulated 
by the time-gauge, one is the affectation of aristoc- 
racy in letters ; the other is the claim of affiliation 
with the proletarian order. Fortunately, we are not 
compelled to the adoption of either method ; but if 
we were, our choice would light upon the man who 
trusts to results, does not make us partners of his 
toil by a wearisome recital of past labors. The 
" get-there stroke " of a winning though much de- 
rided crew suffices, be the time long or short. 

A student displayed a thesis he had just finished, 
observing, " That ought to be good, for it cost me 
trouble enough ! " Does not the remark embody the 
sentiment of those who would apotheosize literary 
toil for its own sake? A further instance : An emi- 
nent scientific man, Marshall Hall, who enriched 
the world of physics by the notable discovery of 
reflex action, did what he could to destroy some of 
the fine dramatic effect of his work ; for when he 
fell beneath the blandishments of the interviewer, 
at last, he stated numerically the exact number of 



hours consumed in this discovery. Captain Barclay, 
who walked one thousand miles in one thousand 
hours, thereby striding into immortality, did a less 
ignominious thing than did our scientist, when he 
invented against time. 

The powers that come direct from Heaven, and 
cost us nothing, are alluded to as "gifts." The 
word is a favorite one with Natty Bumpo, and (to 
bring together extremes) we may also recall that 
the great British orator, Edmund Burke, when he 
wishes to offer the highest praise of chivalry, speaks 
of its possession as the " nnbonght grace of life." 

Is it from a commercial sense of equivalents that 
our eulogists of labor value a work for what it has 
cost in effort ? But why should we rate the gifts of 
the gods as negotiable treasure? 

S. E. ELLIOTT. 



CAPRICE OF THE MUSES. 



Of old the Muses sat on high, 

And beard and judged the songs of men; 
On one they smiled, who loitered by: 

Of toiling ten, they slighted ten. 

" They lightly serve who serve us best, 

Nor know they how the task was done; 
We Muses love a soul at rest, 
But violence and toil we shun." 

If men say true, the Muses now 

Have changed their ancient habitude, 

And would be served with knitted brow, 
And stress and toil each day renewed. 

So each one with the other vies, 

Of those who weave romance or song: 
" On us, O Muse, bestow the prize, 

For we have striven well and long! " 

And yet methinks I hear the best 

Come murmuring down from Helicon: 
" They lightly serve who serve us best, 

Nor know they how the task was done! "

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE POETRY OF THE CUBAN WAR. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt, through your 
kindness, of the new battle-song by Mr. . S. Willcoz, 
entitled " I Hear Afar the Rolling Drum," sent pre- 
sumably by its author or publisher as a courteous but 
crushing rejoinder to my complaint (THE DIAL, Aug. 16) 
of the lack of good Cuban- War poetry. Mr. Willcox's 
production, though not perhaps of a sort to greatly up- 
lift the soul, or to send a man rejoicing to the cannon's 
mouth, is still fairly well rhymed and tuneful; and I 
shall certainly sing it myself and recommend it to my 
friends. But I do not think it forms in itself a suffi- 
cient answer to the charge that the pott* of America did 
not rise to the occasion furnished by the late war. Some 
sparks of true lyric fire struck from the soul, say, of 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



125 



Mr. Stedman or Mr. Gilder, or even Mr. " Ironquill," 
might reasonably have been expected. Certainly had 
Mr. Whittier been with us such deeds as Hobson's would 
not have gone unsung. It is argued that the war with 
Spain was not, like our Civil War, one sanctified by 
principle, but that it was a mere fight (dare I say 
" scrap " ?) forced on the government by a morbid pop- 
ular craving for excitement ; and that therefore our 
poets were not likely to find much inspiration in it. 
But the plea is hardly a valid one. Whatever one may 
think of the war with Spain in its origin, or as a whole, 
it undeniably had its episodes of heroism as fine as ever 
fired the soul of bard. Even Professor Norton must 
have felt at times like " dropping into poetry." Then 
turn to the Crimean War one which few humane and 
intelligent Englishmen favored at the time, and which 
no Englishman not a Jingo and a rabid Russophobe pre- 
tends to justify now. It was certainly not a war " sanc- 
tified by principle"; but it evoked the "Charge of 
the Light Brigade." In reply to the statement in the 
press cutting you send me, that I either do not " read the 
newspapers " or else have " set my poetry-gauge too 
high," permit me to say that I do, of sad necessity, read 
(or skim) the newspapers regularly cords of them ; 
and it was in the course of this pursuit that I was struck 
by the fact deplored in my first letter. As to " setting 
my poetry-gauge too high " for the occasion, I may 
safely leave that question to readers of THE DIAL. At 
all events, if the late war evoked one poem as good, or 
half as good, as " Barbara Frietche," even, or one song as 
stirring as " Marching Through Georgia," I have cer- 
tainly failed to see the one and to hear the other.

AN AFFRONT TO AMERICAN POETS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It was with surprise as well as indignation that I read 
in your valued journal of last issue the querulous com- 
plaint of a correspondent who signs himself " W. R. K.," 
that the recent war has " evoked no poetry worth men- 
tioning." " W. R. K." appears to be one of those book- 
ish and supercilious persons who wilfully ignore or 
belittle (for reasons best known to themselves) the sur- 
prising amount of really good poetical work done in our 
daily papers. Now I am glad to say I have seen some 
splendid and stirring poems on Cuban War subjects in 
the papers during the summer, and I have carefully 
preserved them. Two stanzas from one of these (enti- 
tled " Maine To Her Sons ") I subjoin, hoping they may 
meet the eye, and perhaps the approval, of " W. R. K.": 

" Hark ! o'er Katahdin's craggy head 
Columbia's eagle fiercely screams, 
And swift athwart the darkling sky 
( Like tail of comet hurtling by ) 
His plumage proudly streams 
Aux Armes ! 

" Arise ! Arise ! ye sons of sires 

Who distaff left to him who runs : 
None but the dastard stops to choose, 
So, heroes, stiffen up your thews, 
And limber up your guns 

Aux Armes ! " 

I shall not say here who wrote the above verses; but 
they appeared in a well-known Maine journal, a copy of 
which is at your service, should you care to print the 
poem entire nine stanzas. Perhaps this " war poem " 
may not come up to " W. R. K.'s" exalted standards; 



but it seems to me to have a rude thrill in it, which is 
the great test of merit in productions of its class. The 
first stanza has in it a ring of Thomas Gray (vide " The 

Bard ") ' JOSEPH P. PERKINS. 

Penobscott, Me., Aug. 21, 1898. 

[Without disparaging the poetic quality of our 
correspondent's sample stanzas, we may say that the 
strain is not just the one we would choose to march 
to death to, and something more will be needed to 
close the case in favor of the war-poets. Editor

THE FOREIGN-LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have already referred in your columns to the estab- 
lishment of a Foreign Language School in Tokyo for 
the purpose of advancing post-graduate study in certain 
foreign languages. The first year's work of this insti- 
tution has been very successful; and the prospects for 
its second year are most encouraging. Instruction has 
been given in seven foreign languages English, French, 
German, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. Each of 
these languages has not only a capable Japanese teacher 
of translation and grammar, but also a native teacher of 
conversation and composition. The director of this 
school is Naibu Kanda, a graduate of Amherst College 
in the class of '78 and now a prominent educator of this 
Empire. The principal Japanese teacher of English is 
Eiji Asada, who is a graduate of the Northwestern Uni- 
versity ('91), and also has the honor of having received 
the first degree (Ph.D.) granted by the (new) University 
of Chicago. If the other Japanese teachers are as well 
qualified as these two, the school is well equipped. 

I am informed that the faculty meetings of this school 
are very interesting, not only because they are cosmo- 
politan but also because they are rather Babel-like. The 
German understands no language except his own; the 
Korean is in the same condition; the Chinese under- 
stands only English, and the Frenchman only German; 
the Englishman understands French and a little German ; 
the Spaniard understands French and English; while 
the Russian, the best scholar of all, understands French, 
German, and a little English. Each Japanese teacher 
generally understands only the one language which he 
is teaching. Hence, there is no common language, 
although French is said to be the most widely under- 
stood, with English and German next. 

An interesting story is told of the call which the 
director of this school made upon the German imme- 
diately after the arrival of the latter in Tokyo. Mr. 
Kanda could not use German, and tried both English 
and French in vain, but finally managed to make some 
communication by writing Latin! 

This foreign Language School is organically con- 
nected with the Higher Commercial School, which also 
boasts a very flourishing English-speaking Society. The 
annual exhibition of this society has just been held, and 
passed off very successfully. The native pupils ren- 
dered popular English songs, even negro melodies; gave 
recitations from Shakespeare, Dickens, Hood, Long- 
fellow, Webater, and Mark Twain; with an original 
debate in English, which was especially good. These 
things serve to illustrate the remarkable progress that 
has been made in a nation which fifty years ago was 
closed to the rest of the world.

GENERAL, MILES ix EUROPE.* 

In the summer of 1897, as will be remem- 
bered, General Nelson A. Miles, the Alcibiades 
and Cominander-in-Chief of our now victorious 
army, went abroad in a semi-official way mainly 
with the purpose of observing the Greco- 
Turkish war then in progress. The war ending 
shortly, he was called to London to represent 
us at the Queen's Jubilee, whence he crossed 
over again to the Continent to attend the autumn 
military mano3vres. We were all pleased at the 
time over General M lies' s appointments, for we 
felt that he was precisely the man who would 
appear well where appearances count for so 
much, and we reflected with secret satisfaction 
that no matter how gorgeous the " function " 
or how fine the assemblage at which he might 
be officially called upon to assist, his figure and 
equipment could not fail to win the approval of 
the critical. It is gratifying to learn now, from 
his lively and entertaining book, " Military 
Europe," that the General not only had a pleas- 
ant and profitable time while abroad, but also 
that he was received in high places everywhere 
with the consideration due to his exterior and 
credentials. 

The question, however, here naturally arises 
whether, in case General Miles should revisit 
Europe officially in the near future, the " con- 
sideration " with which he was received last 
summer would not ripen into something a good 
deal more effusive, now that this country has 
shown that it can fight as well as trade, and has 
thereby signally upset a once current theory 
that, in the kind words of Mr. Kipling, America 
was a mere " big, fat republic " wallowing in 
dollars, and as easy a prey as China to the first 
European power (Spain not excepted) that 
might see fit to attack it. To the friend of true 
progress it is saddening to note the signs (man- 
ifest, for instance, in the changed status of 
Japan, in the rehabilitation of Turkey, and in 
the new regard, since Majuba Hill and the de- 
feat of Jameson, for the rights of the little Boer 
republic) that, after all, Ability to Fight is the 
one virtue that commands substantial and un- 
equivocal respect in Europe. Our own present 
case seems to be also one in point. We have 
unexpectedly beaten Spain with an ease and 
swiftness that would be comic were it not for the 
tragic plight and the bravery of the vanquished ;

and lo ! of a sudden the name of our friends 
oversea is legion. Foreign powers that, so long 
as the issue of our quarrel with Spain was com- 
paratively doubtful, were cool toward us and 
even hostile, now tender us the hand of amity, 
and are not above assuring us confidentially 
that, though appearances were to the contrary, 
it was all along " Codlin that was the friend, 
not Short." 

But we are forgetting General Miles. Leav- 
ing Washington on May 4, 1897, he visited in 
turn Constantinople, Athens, Lamia, where the 
contending armies were then facing each other, 
London, St. Petersburg, Peterhof, where he 
conversed with the Czar, Krasnoe-Selo for the 
Russian manoeuvres, Berlin, Essen at Krupp's 
invitation, Homburg for the German, and St. 
Quentin for the French, manoeuvres. General 
Miles was highly impressed with the good 
qualities of the Turkish soldiers, finding them 
" among the most effective in the world," a fact 
for which there are several reasons. First, the 
Turks are a strong race, used to hard labor, 
and hence are good raw material physically ; 
secondly, their religion inculcates obedience, 
enforces simple and temperate habits, and guar- 
antees immediate entry into the joys of a very 
conceivable paradise to the believer who dies in 
battle. The term of service, too, required in 
Turkey is long (twenty years), and a great 
deal of that service during the past century has 
been active. In fact, the Turk is now seen to 
be, in respect of his army at any rate, by no 
means the Sick Man of Europe about to take 
leave of his neighbors and his estate. General 
Miles formed a high opinion of the Turkish 
commanders, notably of Osman Pasha, who 
reminded him strongly of Grant : 

" He is a man about sixty-six years old, well built, of 
medium height, strong in physique, and intellectually 
the peer of any of the field- marshals I subsequently met 
in Europe. ... In referring to the success of the army, 
the rapidity with which it had been mobilized, and the 
universal success in the series of battles just ended be- 
tween the Turks and Greeks, he made a significant 
remark. ' Persistency,' he said, ' is the great secret of 
success in war. If an army is not successful one day, 
tenacity of purpose and persistency will in the end bring 
victory.' This was very characteristic of the man who 
commanded the government forces in the latter part of 
our great civil war." 

General Miles had an audience of the Sultan 
in the Imperial Palace, where he was cordially 
received by the Great Assassin, who led the 
conversation at once toward military topics : 

" He manifested great interest in military matters, 
and was thoroughly posted on the equipment of armies, 
the use and effect of modern appliances of war, the use 
of heavy machinery in the movements of the heaviest

high-power guns, as well as the most intricate mechan- 
ism of small arms, and the use and effect of smokeless 
powder and high explosives. His small stature, sharp, 
dark eyes, prominent nose, of the Roman type, full 
beard, were not unlike the marked characteristics that 
I have noticed in some men of our country." 

Arrived at Athens, General Miles found a 
very different state of affairs from that prevail- 
ing at the capital of the victorious Turks : 

" I came to a city exposed on every hand, deficient in 
military resources, its government dejected by defeat, 
its people dissatisfied with their rulers and divided in 
their opinion of what had been done, or what course 
should be pursued in the future. . . . Many were defi- 
ant, and loudly argued for fighting to the bitter end; 
others were hoping for an interposition of the powers, 
which, if it left their country humbled, still would pre- 
vent the Turks from appropriating it altogether." 

The officers of the Greek army seemed to 
General Miles to be an intelligent, patriotic 
body of men, though then naturally much de- 
pressed at the result of the campaign. The 
soldiers had endured hardship and disaster with 
fortitude, but were greatly disheartened, their 
only hope being that something might occur to 
end hostilities. There was a great want of 
proper equipment and supplies, and the army 
was badly demoralized, both by the lack of food 
and shelter, and by the presence of a multitude 
of refugees, numbering 50,000 perhaps, who 
had abandoned their homes carrying with them 
what little of their scant belongings they could 
transport upon their backs, in carts, and upon 
a few pack-animals. Clearly, the Greek army 
was doomed to certain disaster in the event of 
further fighting ; and the Turk, reeking from 
his Armenian exploits, had won a new lease of 
political life in Christian Europe. 

The author's account of the Jubilee is graphic, 
but he tells us little that is new now in the his- 
tory of that splendid pageant which lent so 
powerful an impulse to the growing spirit of 
" Imperialism " in Europe. Not since the days 
of Rome had the beck of a single sceptre 
brought together figuratively at an Imperial 
capital so imposing and motley an array of trib- 
utary peoples. The spectacle was not lost on 
Russia, Germany, and France. General Miles 
attended the great naval review off Spithead, 
where, he notes, " In the line of foreign vessels 
was a single warship of the United States, the 
' Brooklyn.' She was the only vessel in the 
line painted white, and the irreverent tars called 
her the ' cement factory.' " Spain, we remem- 
ber, was represented by the " Vizcaya," a for- 
midable looking craft that easily outranked in 
foreign eyes the untried representative of our 
" brand new dollar navy." But times change. 



General Miles's account of the military man- 
oeuvres is interesting, and carries the weight of 
expert opinion. He tactfully steers clear of 
odious comparisons of armies that, rivals in 
point of efficiency and preparedness to-day, 
may possibly be rivals on the battle-field to- 
morrow. The Russian review at Krasnoe-Selo 
he considers one of the finest military displays 
he ever witnessed. Russian officers are " skilled 
and accomplished," and their men are " well 
disciplined and well-armed ": 

" The Russian army is, I think, capable of greater 
endurance in the field than any other in Europe. The 
infantry and artillery are composed of strong, hardy 
men, and the cavalry are unexcelled. The Cossacks 
constitute perhaps the best of the mounted troops." 

The author was much interested, while watch- 
ing the combats at the German manoeuvres, in 
the effect of the smokeless powder : 

" One heard the sound of cannon and the rattle of 
musketry, but saw nothing until the troops advanced or 
retreated across the country within his line of vision. 
Thus one formerly valuable means of judging of the 
whereabouts of an enemy and of the progress of a battle 
is taken from a commanding officer by the use of smoke- 
less powder." 

General Miles, as we all know, was to have 
a better opportunity of judging of the value of 
smokeless powder later on ; and he now doubt- 
less coincides fully with Colonel Roosevelt's 
opinion in that matter as well as in certain 
other views of the plain-spoken Rough Rider's 
of a like general tenor and bearing. Black 
powder and Springfield rifles are now, we trust, 
rated with " Brown Bess " muskets and flint 
locks, so far as our troops are concerned. 

General Miles was favorably impressed, as 
may be supposed, by both the German and 
French troops ; but his cautious estimates afford 
little clew as to which of the two armies he 
would pick for the winner should hostilities 
again break out. To the Italian army he pays 
the compliment of saying that it is more serv- 
iceably and tastefully uniformed than most 
troops, and that, although it has seen some re- 
verses of late, it is now " in a very high order 
of discipline, instruction, and equipment, and 
makes a creditable showing." 

" During iny stay in Rome there was a review by the 
King of Italy, accompanied by the King of Siam, of 
some 12,000 of the best Italian troops. It would be 
hard to excel this body in uniform, military appearance, 
and general excellence of condition." 

General Miles's book, while its magazine 
origin is evident throughout, is informing on 
military matters, and will prove pleasant and 
profitable reading. There are a number of 
good illustrations. E. G. j.

CHIPS FBOM A CRITIC'S SHOULDER.* 

A distinguished writer for " Literature," not 
long ago, endeavored, in his own charming way, 
to conceal from his readers the idea that there 
was at present an opportunity in American let- 
ters for a critic. I do not know just how I 
managed to catch his idea myself ; possibly I 
jumped at it because something of the sort had 
crossed my own mind. What Mr. James 
thinks of the already established authors of the 
dozen or two volumes of essays on literary sub- 
jects which have appeared in the last twelve 
months or so, he does not say. It does not 
seem to me that they occupy, certainly they do 
not fill up, that " room at the top " in which 
the critic mentioned shall sit and consider the 
works of the world beneath. I have wondered 
why so few of them really fired the mind. 

For these reasons, I turned to Mr. Chapman's 
volume of essays with a feeling that here, per- 
haps, might be found the man who was sought. 
Mr. James suggested the question, but left it 
open. Certainly we have in these essays more 
serious work than usually appears in such collec- 
tions, serious, not thereby dull and tedious, but 
worth considering. I should like to consider 
them all if there were space. But the essays on 
Emerson and Whitman had already been more 
or less discussed before the book was published ; 
so that there will be reason enough for speaking 
only of the essays on Browning and Stevenson. 

Of these, the first seems to me admirable. 
It takes rather a simple but a perfectly main- 
tainable view, and keeps it before the reader 
clearly and well. It is a view which will open 
Browning up to a good many people. To 
Browningites it may not bring much, not 
even pleasure. But not everybody has read 
Browning yet ; there are a good many who are 
only now beginning the experience. Mr. Chap- 
man says that the great mass of Browning will 
in future be rediscovered by " belated sufferers 
from the philosophy of the nineteenth century." 
I imagine that there are large numbers of these 
belated sufferers now-a-days, there are always 
many such, people in this case who are just 
awakening to the dangerous opinions of Kenan 
and Strauss, are just becoming conscious of the 
hypotheses of Darwin and Spencer, who have 
lately been introduced to the paintings of 
Hume-Jones, and the music of Wagner, and 
the writings of Ruskin. These people have to 
accommodate Browning somehow, and they are

apt to find it difficult. Mr. Chapman's essay 
ought to put them in the right way ; and this 
is proof of its excellence in another direction, 
a direction in which Mr. Chapman was prob- 
ably aiming, unconscious of the particular use 
which I have suggested. Mr. Chapman's idea 
was to show what had actually been the rela- 
tion of Browning to the middle of the nineteenth 
century. He is a critic who studies the fact 
with disinterestedness, not a diff user of popular 
culture. Still, if Mr. Chapman has arranged 
the standpoint so that approachers of Browning 
see everything in right perspective, it is prob- 
able that he has clearly in mind the way the 
thing really was to contemporaries. So I ad- 
mire the essay on Browning, although it does 
not .say much of one element in Browning's 
work which interests some people, namely, 
the " literary side." Mr. Chapman considers 
the philosophical and historical aspects, and 
also the diction and metre ; and as these are 
the things which are of interest to most people, 
he does well. I have an interest in the fact 
that we have in Browning, as in any author, 
life, emotion, passion, taking literary forms, 
and in the circumstances attending metamor- 
phoses. But these things do not occupy Mr. 
Chapman's attention very much : I imagine he 
thinks them rather trivial. 

The essay on Stevenson, like that on Brown- 
ing, is an explanation of the nature of the man 
and of his "relation to his time," or, practically, 
what he really has in him that is worth while. 
Here I cannot feel that Mr. Chapman repeats 
his success. It seems to me that he offers a 
facile explanation born rather from his own 
mind than from any especial knowledge of 
Stevenson's work. He thinks that Stevenson 
was devoted to Art, that he thought that the 
way to write with art was to write as other 
great men had written, that he therefore imi- 
tated all sorts of people, and that the things 
written in this way looked so much like real 
literary things that people who did not know 
any better were quite taken in by them. He 
thinks that Americans were well pleased with 
Stevenson's stories and things, and were fas- 
cinated to see that what they liked had the 
characteristics which reminded them of stand- 
ard authors, and therefore seemed literary. 
Hence America urged Stevenson to write 
twenty thousand dollars' worth a year, and 
praised him to the skies. This process Mr. 
Chapman sums up under the genial epigram, 
It is Chicago making culture hum." 

It must be said at once that there may have 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



129 



been something of this, though I cannot say 
that I think there was much. But, further, I 
suppose it must occur to most people that it is 
rather a curious assumption that what the 
American people as a whole recognized and 
liked in Stevenson was style, and also that 
there could not have been anything else in his 
work which the American people as a whole 
(those crude, half-baked, distressing y earners 
for culture) really did like, and perhaps with- 
out recognizing it. Of course there were and 
are those who are always talking of style and 
Stevenson, but I would bet a large apple that 
about nine-tenths of those who delight in Stev- 
enson have no suspicion that he " has style," 
and would regard it as a blemish if the notion 
occurred to them. And on the other hand, 
where there is a perfectly obvious characteristic 
of Stevenson, a thing peculiarly delightful to 
the present time and peculiarly adapted to gain 
affection and popularity, it seems curious not 
to mention it. 

As to the matter of style, I cannot say enough 
just here to present all the difficulties that I 
seem to see in Mr. Chapman's work. I must 
content myself with noting that I think he does 
not at all understand the attitude of a writer 
to what he writes, nor the attitude of Stevenson 
to what he wrote ; and also I cannot feel that 
he has any particular acquaintance with the 
way Stevenson did write. I mean he does not 
seem to have read his books carefully with a 
view to style a matter which is of slight 
interest to him. 

If I am right here, it is necessary that Mr. 
Chapman should be wrong ; and he does not 
get on better by misrepresenting various things, 
through negligence or what not. It would be 
uninteresting to go over minor errors, but of 
course a number of confident assertions of 
things that are not so, even if they be not im- 
portant, does much to weaken one's confidence 
in the foundation of a critic's views. 

But not only is Mr. Chapman often wrong 
as to what he regards as the fact, but also he 
neglects what seems to me the real reason why 
people did like Stevenson, the real thing 
characteristic of the man and the time, which 
in the case of Browning Mr. Chapman did get. 
If this were an essay on Stevenson, I would go 
into this matter in detail ; but as it is really 
about Mr. Chapman I must be content to say 
that in this essay he has seized, distorted, and 
exaggerated a detail, and not mentioned the 
main point at all. He has not shown any espe- 
cial reason why people who really know what 



is good should find in Stevenson anything worth 
while. 

The things that I have said about these two 
essays might also be said of the essays on 
Emerson and Whitman. That on Emerson is 
as good as the Browning essay, or even better, 
and in the same way, with the addition that 
Emerson really was primarily a social force as 
Mr. Chapman considers him, whereas Brown- 
ing was primarily a poet. The essay on Whit- 
man, however, is as wrong as the essay on 
Stevenson, and in just the same way, too ; it 
does not mention the main point, but devotes 
itself to exaggeration of minor matters. The 
reason for this rather peculiar matter is inter- 
esting. It lies partly in a circumstance and 
partly in a characteristic of Mr. Chapman. 
The Emerson and Browning cults are now 
accepted : they are no longer annoying. It is 
a matter of course that people will read Emer- 
son and Browning if they want : nobody is sur- 
prised any more than they are nowadays at 
people smoking, or eating tomatoes. But the 
Whitman cult and the Stevenson cult are not 
accepted ; they are still on the offensive, so far 
as they are cults at all. The great bulk of 
the reading public, which is satisfied to have 
Emerson and Browning classics, is also sat- 
isfied to leave Whitman unread and to regard 
Stevenson as a pleasant story-teller. So those 
devoted to these writers must speak up. This 
they occasionally do in public or in private, 
but not very much, to tell the truth, and 
certainly not enough to annoy seriously a nor- 
mal temper. 

One of Mr. Chapman's characteristics, how- 
ever, seems to be that he is annoyed at such 
things. He hates to have people blundering 
round and saying foolish things about literature, 
even in an unobtrusive manner ; and so he be- 
comes enraged with the Whitmaniacs and the 
Stevensonians. These two essays are really a 
little behind the times : as controversial docu- 
ments they are good ; as critical judgments, 
failures. Mr. Chapman is like Mr. Saunders 
in "The New Republic," who was crazy to 
shatter a faith no longer held by the company 
in which he found himself. 

This may seem a trivial thing to mention. 
It is really the most important thing to note 
about Mr. Chapman as a critic. Mr. Chapman 
is too apt to be irritated at current popular 
opinion and feeling, contemptuous of it, unsym- 
pathetic, uncomprehending. He is quite willing 
to utter the truth, and to have people take it or 
leave it. But as for any real human interest 



130 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



in the people he U writing for, he has not a 
cent's worth. He cannot think of the Amer- 
ican literary public with interest, or even with 
equanimity ; he cannot speak of it without 
cold sarcasm. 

Now all this is probably well enough. The 
American people Chicago making culture 
hum, magazine editors ordering new Pulvis et 
Umbras, mill-hands and so on reading Long- 
fellow, the general reading public which kills 
Foe and creates Bryant (to use Mr. Chapman's 
epigrams) is rarely much in flue need by such 
attitudes ; it is too apt to go on its way, often 
without knowing that it is scorned. Mr. Chap- 
man's way is probably not a good way to influ- 
ence America ; nor for himself, in the long run 
at least, is the result likely to be good. In the 
first place, with his lack of feeling for his coun- 
trymen he will probably fail ever to say much 
that is important to them ; and in the second, 
with his own disposition he will often be irri- 
tated by harmless fallacies or fancies into 
ebullitions which will send him a long distance 
from the right road. 

Still, it will be thought by no one that such 
an element in a man's work is ineradicable. 
It may be or may not be a permanent factor. 
Mr. Chapman, as everyone is aware by this 
time, has enough power to carry a good deal 
of weight. As has been often enough said, he 
is delicate, keen, strong, clever, and full of 
courage. The disposition which I have noted 
may render a good deal of his work of slight 
effect ; on the other hand, he may find out how 
to use it to good purpose, to make it telling. 
Certainly for the time being, it makes his essays 
rather more amusing to people who do not get 
vexed at them.

THREE CHARACTERS FROM FRENCH 
HISTORY.* 

Mr. H. C. MacDowall's volume of biograph- 
ical essays presents portrait-studies of the great 
Duke of Guise, Agrippa d'Aubigne*, and Cath- 
erine of Navarre. The first of the three studies 
is the most elaborate, occupying more than half 
of the volume ; the last is little more than an 
episode. 

The dark and troublous centuries of French 
history after St. Louis reached their romantic, 
if not their political, climax in the days when

Huguenot and Catholic fought and plotted for 
the supremacy ; when Terror was already, as in 
1793, "the order of the day"; and when, if 
ever, a man's foes were they of his own house- 
hold. It was this sixteenth century, with its 
Charles IX. and its Henri IV., its St. Bartholo- 
mew and its Edict of Nantes, that produced the 
three characters whom Mr. MacDowall has so 
brightly and so darkly set before us. 

His account of the Guise family, their tra- 
ditions, ambitions, and achievements, follows 
well-known historical lines, and is generally 
free from prepossessions and polemics. He 
recognizes in Henry of Guise a master-spirit of 
his time, noble with its nobleness of soul, cruel 
with its cruelty, superior in strength of char- 
acter to all his friends and most of his foes. 
The murder of Coligny is described at some 
length, as befits that bloody prelude to the 
St. Bartholomew. We hear Guise's impatient 
question to the assassin, " Is it done ? " and 
when, sixteen years later, Guise met from a 
faithless king the same fate he had prepared 
for the great Admiral, we are ready, with Mr. 
MacDowall, to recognize that poetic justice was 
wrought. " The King, hearing the sound of the 
fall, came fearfully to the door of the cabinet 
and looked out from under the curtain. ' Is it 
done ? ' he asked ; and if the Duke's fine ear 
were not yet deaf to every mortal sound, he 
surely must have caught that faint, awful echo 
of his own voice, floating to him across the 
space of sixteen troubled years." 

On the vexed question whether the St. Bar- 
tholomew was a crime of impulse or premedi- 
tation, Mr. MacDowall briefly states, without 
arguing, his own view, namely, that the mas- 
sacre was a desperate and sudden resolve of 
Catherine de' Medici, occasioned by the failure 
of the first attempt to kill Coligny. Guise's 
unexpected holding aloof from the massacre 
and his rescue of many Huguenots are attrib- 
uted by his biographer to primary motives of 
humanity. "Henry of Guise was naturally 
as kindly as his father, and in a cruel age no 
act of cold-blooded cruelty is proved against 
him, either before or after the St. Barthol- 
omew. In any case, the fact remains that when 
every way of escape was closed to the Hugue- 
nots, the doors of Guise's house stood open to 
them." 

To Agrippa d'Aubigne*, the soldier-poet, the 
devoted adherent of Henry of Navarre, the 
grandfather of Mme. de Maintenon, are given 
about a hundred pages of graphic narrative, in 
which, as was inevitable, the complex character 



1898.]

of the King of Navarre receives about as much 
attention as is bestowed upon the titular subject 
of the essay. In Henry's fascinating person- 
ality the chief defect was careless ingratitude 
toward the men who had given their lives and 
fortunes to his cause ; his motto, " Je veux tout 
pardonner, tout oublier" was bitterly inter- 
preted to mean that he forgave his enemies and 
forgot his friends. In this unkind fate d'Au- 
bigne had full share ; he had loved much, and 
he was assuredly much forgotten. 

As an historian d'Aubigne is best remem- 
bered by his Histoire Universelle. Mr. Mac- 
Dowall emphasizes his cool and impartial atti- 
tude toward the burning issues of the times. 
" He refuses to speak of the crimes committed 
by the Spaniards in America ' because I cannot 
enter upon this discourse in a spirit of modera- 
tion ' "; a statement which may find modern 
application to the flaming indictments drawn 
against the Spaniards of 1898. 

D'Aubigne takes his place among the poets 
as the author of the epic Les Tragiques. Begun 
when he was twenty-five, continued through 
many years of blood and fire, the poem de- 
scribes the miseries of the civil wars, and traces 
their origin to the vices and follies of those in 
authority. The apostrophe of Catherine de' 
Medici is worth quoting, even in translation, if 
only for one impaling epithet. The poet imag- 
ines her a witch, performing her hideous incan- 
tations and brewing her potions ; and he bids 
her not to waste her strength in these painful, 
unnecessary rites. 

" Toil not to win the aid thou canst compel ; 
What need hast thou of charms ? Within thy hand 
Thou holdst a spell more potent and more swift 
Than all the drugs they bring thee from afar. 
Oft have the demons triumphed by thy means, 
Now is thine hour, triumph thon over them ; 
Vivandiere of Hell, put forth thy power I 
Recount what thou hast done, say what thou seest, 
The victories of thy dark Florentine wiles ; 
Point to thy handiwork ; show France in ruins ; 
Show all the souls, depraved, despairing, damned, 
Who curse their God and thee, say 't was thy craft 
Which sent these legions marching down to Hell ; 
It will suffice ; at that imperious word 
The infernal host shall move to do thy will." 

The third of these essays is a sketch of the 
unhappy Catherine of Navarre, whose life was 
spent in trying to avoid marriages arranged 
for her by her brother ; a life which finally 
" beat its music out," after she had been forced 
into a union with the Duke of Bar, in steadfast 
refusal to be coerced from her faith for the sake 
of her husband and his family.

AN AUTHORITATIVE BOOK ON MEXICO.* 

Senor Matias Romero, the author of " Notes 
on Mexico," is the Minister from Mexico to the 
United States. Twice a cabinet member in his 
own country, he is thoroughly informed in re- 
gard to Mexican affairs. The first part of the 
book grew out of a talk given, by invitation, to 
a " travel club " in the city of Washington ; 
later, this talk was expanded into a paper read 
before the American Geographical Society of 
New York and published in its Bulletin ; this 
in turn has been considerably increased for 
publication in its present form. It is a plain, 
straightforward statement of things Mexican 
Physical Features, Geology, Climate, Flora, 
Population, Condition. Everyone but the spe- 
cialist will be likely to find here just about what 
he wants to know regarding our sister republic. 
Part II. consists of Statistical Tables. It is very 
difficult to secure reliable Mexican statistics 
extending over a long period. At many times 
in Mexico's national history, careful collec- 
tion and recording of facts has been impossible. 
What can be done Senor Romero has done ; the 
data he presents are the best that can be secured. 
The financial statistics for the last few years 
are reliable, but the fluctuation in the value of 
the currency makes comparison difficult. The 
statistics given cover a wide range : revenues 
and expenses, state and municipal finances, 
foreign trade, trade between Mexico and the 
United States, coinage, gold exports, railways, 
public debt, postoffice and telegraph service, 
banks, public lands, education, manufacturing 
interests, navigation, agricultural products, 
are all discussed. In an appendix, besides some 
geographical notes, are presented tables of alti- 
tudes and a capital description of the great 
engineering feat just completed in the works 
for draining the Valley of Mexico. 

Such is a brief outline of the work. One 
thought instantly strikes the mind of the reader 
at all acquainted with Mexico : here is a book 
in capital English written for English readers 
by a Mexican foreign Minister. How many for- 
eign Ministers has the United States ever sent 
to Mexico who could talk good Spanish, let 
alone write books in that language ? Have we 
ever had one who could add a volume worth 
reading to Mexican-Spanish literature? We 
have had some men in our diplomatic service 
in Mexico who could write books, e. g., Poinsett, 
Waddy Thompson, and Brantz Mayer, but

none who ever wrote what would greatly profit 
Mexican readers. 

Sefior Romero's book is crowded with valu- 
able information. Very interesting are his con- 
cise notes regarding products of the country. 
Mexico can produce the plants of almost any 
land. Wheat, maize, coffee, india-rubber, 
sugar cane, ginger, and tobacco are among the 
most notable at present. The brief statements 
as to needs, opportunities, and methods of cul- 
tivation are practically important. One notices 
with a smile that the United States takes the 
bulk of the chicle crop. Our importation rose 
from the value of $156,402 to $1,527,838 be- 
tween the years 1885-1895. And what is 
chicle f The gum of a tree used for the making 
of chewing-gum. Sefior Romero pleads for the 
planting of the mulberry and the raising of 
silk in Mexico, as if such culture were an expe- 
riment. It is not, however, so. At times in 
the past silk culture was an important industry ; 
and in one of his charming essays, the eminent 
Mexican historian, Sefior Icazbalceta, fully dis- 
cusses it. Mexican resources are great ; knowl- 
edge of them is still but meagre ; important 
discoveries are being constantly made. Thus, 
recent as is Romero's book, and up-to-date, it 
does not mention one of the greatest copper 
mining interests of America located in the state 
of Guerrero and operated by a recently organ- 
ized French syndicate with an enormous capital. 
No writer can produce a book on Mexican 
progress which will be complete at the time it 
appears from the press. 

Sefior Romero fully realizes the opportunities 
presented by his country to foreign settlers and 
foreign capital. His book itself is calculated 
to lure Americans to Mexico. There are many 
opportunities for making wealth there, cer- 
tainly ; but there are few Americans so consti- 
tuted as to happily and profitably use them. 
Of all foreigners in Mexico, in Central Amer- 
ica, and in South America to-day, the German 
is the most successful, the most influential, and 
the most at home. It is because he takes things 
as he finds them and does not try to make over 
the conditions around him. The English and 
American must always do business in their own 
way, and insist upon others doing as they do. 
They do not adjust themselves. Sefior Romero 
says: 

"It will be very difficult for the fun-loving, self- 
indulgent, Anglo-Saxon Englishman of America to com- 
pete with these self-denying Spaniards, capable of living 
with the nose to the grindstone twenty, twenty-five, or 
thirty years, eating always sparingly, drinking wine, 
but in moderation, spending no money, dressing poorly, 



and ever with a fortune accumulating. The American 
wants to cut a dash and so does the Englishman, else 
the English would have maintained their commercial 
supremacy in Mexico. They lost it to the more frugal 
and economical Germans."

RECENT AMERICAN POETRY.* 

More than a score of volumes of American verse 
received during the past few months show that we 
have as many poets as ever, if moat of them are minor. 
We have selected for brief comment about a dozen 
of these thin volumes, and have sought, as usual, to 
represent each writer by at least one example of his 
best work. The most conspicuous place on the list 
clearly belongs to the two Canadians whom contin- 
ued residence in the United States permits us to 
claim as at least half our own. Mr. Charles G. D. 
Roberts, whose pure lyric note was first welcomed 
by THE DIAL many years ago, has just published a 
collection of "New York Nocturnes, and Other 
Poems," which is distinguished by both delicacy of 
sentiment and unusual perfection of form. We think 
that Mr. Roberts is more poetical when he has Tan- 
traraar for his theme rather than Manhattan, but 
his nocturnes of the great city have little of what is 
called local color, and are really outpourings of a 
spirit oblivious to its surroundings except in their 
larger and more obvious aspects. There is a sug- 
gestion of New York, but no more, in such verses 
as these : 

" The street is a grim caflon carved 

In the eternal stone, 
That knows no more the rushing stream 

It anciently has known.

" The emptying tide of life has drained 

The iron channel dry. 
Strange winds from the forgotten day 
Draw down, and dream, and sigh. 

" The narrow heaven, the desolate moon 

Made wan with endless years, 
Seem less immeasurably remote 
Than laughter, love, or tears." 

Mr. Roberts is not completely himself until he gets 
into full communion with nature, and then he strikes 
the full chord of beauty, at once sensuous and spir- 
itual, as in this all but perfect poem, " The Falling 
Leaves ": 

" Lightly He blows, and at His breath they fall, 

The perishing kindreds of the leaves ; they drift, 
Spent flames of scarlet, gold aerial, 

Across the hollow year, noiseless and swift. 
Lightly He blows, and countless as the falling 

Of snow by night upon a solemn sea, 
The ages circle down beyond recalling, 

To strew the hollows of Eternity. 
He sees them drifting through the spaces dim, 
And leaves and ages are as one to Him." 

The thin volumes of verse occasionally put forth 
by Mr. Bliss Carman have a unity not often found 
in such collections. Each volume is a careful selec- 
tion from a considerable mass of material, and 
brings together pieces of the same general class. 
Thus, " By the Aurelian Wall " is a book of elegies, 
all in the same minor mood, and all filled with the 
sense of man's kinship with nature, with the feeling 
that to die is simply to be merged once more into 
the being of the Great Mother from whom we 
draw the fleeting breath of individual life. These 
elegies are wind-blown songs rather than reflective 
and reminiscent utterances, and the vivid imagina- 
tion which fills and thrills them atones in large 
measure for the defect of a lack of polish in the 
technical sense. Among their subjects are Keats, 
Shelley, Blake, Stevenson, Lovelace, and Phillips 
Brooks. We quote two stanzas from the song 
inscribed to Shelley's memory. 

" Thou heart of all the hearts of men, 
Tameless and free, 

And vague as that marsh-wandering fire, 
Leading the world's out-worn desire 
A night march down this ghostly fen 
From sea to sea ! 

" Through this divided camp of dream 
Thy feet have passed, 
As one who should set hand to rouse 
His comrades from their heavy drowse ; 
For only their own deeds redeem 
God's sons at last." 

We cannot help wondering why Mr. Carman should 
have failed to include in this elegiac sheaf the poem 
which seems to us, on the whole, the finest that he 
has ever written that " Death in April " which 
commemorates the passing of Matthew Arnold. It 
has not, we believe, been included in any of his 
previously published volumes, and must still be 
hunted out in the pages of " The Atlantic Monthly " 
where it first appeared. 

Mr. Madison Cawein's " Shapes and Shadows " 
are lyrics of the sort with which his several preced- 



ing volumes have made us familiar, lyrics of nature 
and love a nature tropical rather than polar, a love 
sensuous rather than spiritual. Their lilt and their 
passion often carry the reader away, and yet there 
is a false note in many of them that mars the effect. 
The sonnet " Can I Forget ? " is one of the most 
nearly faultless of these pieces. 

" Can I forget how Love once led the ways 
Of our two lives together, joining them ; 
How every hour was his anadem, 
And every day a tablet in his praise ! 
Can I forget how, in his garden place 
Among the purple roses, stem to stem, 
We heard the rumour of his robe's bright hem, 
And saw the aureate radiance of his face ! 
Though I behold my soul's high dreams down-hurled. 
And Falsehood sit where Truth once towered white, 
And in Love's place, usurping lust and shame . . . 
Though flowers be dead within the winter world, 
Are flowers not there ? and starless though the night, 
Are stars not there, eternal and the same ? " 

There is nothing distinctive about the " Poems " 
of Mr. Philip Becker Goetz, nothing to set their 
writer apart from a hundred of his fellow devotees 
of the minor muses. A favorable example is the 
poem called " Religion." 

" If you have built your soul upon a God 

Whose being starts to shade at skeptic breath 
No halo of all saints who there have trod 
Shall raise you higher than your body's clod. 

" Some day, as hot your ardor leaps to song 

Upon your choir chill Truth will stretch a hand, 
And riotous will burst a million strong 
Through empty aisles and chancels Ruin's throng. 

" Be then your God no god of yesterday, 
And be your temple open to the air, 
Fear not dark conflict, greet the doubtful fray ; 
Not one sun but a host will light your way." 

The chief faults of Mr. Goetz are unmelodionsness 
and the sort of semi-obscurity that comes from the 
failure to embody concepts in a logical framework 
before adorning them with the embroidery of verse. 

Mr. Henry Johnson's pieces, collectively styled 
" Where Beauty Is," run the familiar gamut of Art, 
Nature, and Love. Since Art appears to be the 
tonic of this chord, we will make our selection from 
" The Prayer of Pericles " upon the dedication of 
the Parthenon to Athene. 

"We bring thee but ourselves ; our mother's breast, 
Our own Pentelicus, we wrought to enshroud 
Thy majesty, nor deemed our eager crowd 
Unwelcome to the council of the blest. 

" No longer our defiant citadel, 

This hill be sacred to thine ordered peace, 
Throne of thy spirit where all murmurs cease, 
And beauty mirroring thy thought shall dwell." 

Mr. Johnson aims only at simple effects that are 
well within his powers, and thus achieves a measure 
of relative success. The lesson is one that minor 
bards might well take to heart. 

In commenting upon Mr. C. F. Johnson's volume, 
strangely entitled " What Can I Do for Brady, and 
Other Verse," we fear that we can say nothing more 
encouraging than to repeat the criticism of the 



134 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



writer's youthful son, who is quoted aa having said 
that " papa's poetry was dethidedly amateurish." 
Brady is a labor agitator and fanatic, his discourse 
being after the following fashion : 

" Again I 'm forced to disagree- I 're been on strike 
Fire time* as man, and twice M manager. 
First let me My, we do not loae more than 
We gain by strike*, whichever way it ends." 

Such glaring absurdities (from the standpoint of 
poetry) as these lines exhibit occur throughout Mr. 
Johnson's pages. Still, lest we do the author injus- 
tice, we are bound to represent him by his best as 
well as his worst, and such a sonnet as " History 
and Poetry " is at least sober, thoughtful, and reg- 
ular in form. 

" Three men seem real aa living men we know : 
The Florentine, whoee face, careworn and dark, 
Ronetti drew ; the Norman dnke, ' so stark 

Of arm that none bnt him might bend his bow '; 

And ' gentle Shakespeare,' though enshrouded so 
In his own thought, that some men cannot mark 
The soul his book reveals, as when a lark 

Sings from a cloud, unseen by all below. 

" Bnt still more real than these seem other three 
Who never walked on earth : ' Hamlet the Dane,' 
The ' noble Moor,' the cruel Scottish thane 

Ambition's thrall. How strange that they should be, 
Though naught bnt figments of the poet's brain, 

Instinct with life, and yet more real than he." 

" Morrow-Songs " is numbered three among the 
volumes of Mr. Koopman's verse, published and 
unpublished. Mr. Koopman is best when he is 
briefest, a remark which we make without satirical 
intention, and illustrate by " Appreciation." 

" We crowned with thorns the living hero's brow ; 
Bnt see, we deck his grave with roses now. 

" Now, while the very stones from which he bled 
Climb to a monument above his head." 

"Two Poets," affords another illustration of the 
author's compact way of saying things. 

" He had a straight Greek brow, which sculptors loved, 

And clear and pure his classic measures rang. 

Men hailed him bard by all the gods approved, 

And snowy maids his star-cold numbers sang. 

" Look now on this face. Mark the bulging brow, 
The shapeless mouth, the torn and twisted ear, 
The seams of riot. Nay, who marks them now ? 
He fired men's hearts to win our Golden Year." 

" Love's Shrine," by Mr. L. V. Rule, is a sonnet- 
sequence that might be styled the sentimental auto- 
biography of a prig. In wooden and commonplace 
measures we read the outpourings of one who loved 
not wisely bnt too well for his happiness, until a 
worthier idol took the place of the faithless one. 
The former maiden mnsfe have been much edified by 
the upbraidings of her whilom thrall, who addresses 
her through many pages in such scornful strains as 
these: 

" Thou hast no heart ; 

So centred in thy petty self thon art, 

That 't is delight to thee to cast a slur 

At humbler ones whom thou shouldst bow before. 

Blue-blooded 1 Ah, the billows on the shore 

Are not more empty than thy boast." 



We should say that the bard had done better to 
suffer in silence. Mr. Rule's other poems are lyrics 
of love," and sonnets on current politics Armenia, 
Crete, Cuba, and the like. We have come across 
many luckless misprints in our time, but none, we 
think, quite so unhappy as the following : 

" At last the lands have wakened ; freedom's cause 
Which seemed abandoned, cries aloud no more ; 
And sweet the strains that from the classic snore (tic) 
Of Hellas come." 

A note of indignant passion, a note almost of re- 
volt at the conditions of a life that our own supine 
acquiescence leaves as petty and sordid as we find 
it, thrills through the poems in Mrs. Stetson's vol- 
ume. " In This Our World " there is, indeed, much 
that might be bettered had men only the will to 
overcome their moral inertia, and realize the higher 
life of which most of them are content idly to dream. 
The expression is somewhat rough, but the energy 
is unmistakable, in such lines as these : 

" Why friends ! God is not through ! 
The universe is not complete in yon. 
Yon 're just as bound to follow out his plan 
And sink yourself in ever-growing Man 
As ever were the earliest crudest eggs 
To grow to vertebrates with arms and legs. 
Society holds not its present height 
Merely that you may bring a child to light ; 
Bnt yon and yours live only in the plan 
That 's working out a higher kind of man ; 
A higher kind of life, that shall let grow 
New powers and nobler duties than you know." 

Much better in form, and none the less energetic 
for that, are the lines called " A Man Must Live." 

" A man must live. We justify 
Low shift and trick to treason high, 
A little vote for a little gold 
To a whole senate bought and sold, 
By that self-evident reply. 

" Bnt is it so ? Pray tell me why 
Life at such cost you have to buy ? 
In what religion were you told 
A man must live ? 

"There are times when a man must die. 
Imagine, for a battle-cry, 
From soldiers, with a sword to hold, 
From soldiers, with the flag unrolled, 
This coward's whine, this liar's lie, 
A man most live ! " 

We wish that the large and scornful utterance of 
such a piece as this might be wedded to more me- 
lodious verse, and that it did not so often as it 
does when the gospels of socialism and the rights of 
women possess the consciousness of the speaker 
turn shrill and into mere scolding. Mrs. Stetson 
comes nearest to writing poetry when she turns from 
man to nature, and writes of the West that she 
knows so well. Here, for example, is an etching 
that could not well be improved upon. It is called 
" A Nevada Desert." 

"An aching, blinding, barren, endless plain ; 

Corpse-colored with white mould of alkali, 
Hairy with sage-brash, shiny after rain. 
Burnt with the sky's hot scorn, and still again 

Sullenly burning back against the sky.

" Dull green, dull brown, dull purple, and dull gray, 

The hard earth white with ages of despair, 
Slow-crawling, turhid streams where dead reeds sway, 
Low wall of sombre mountains far away, 
And sickly steam of geysers on the air." 

It is not cheerful, certainly, but it has the visible 
impress of truth. 

The " Poems " of Miss Florence Earle Coates are 
reasonably correct in form and pleasing in expres- 
sion. Many of them deal with the abstractions of 
thought that young poets so dearly love ; others 
embody aspirations of the soul or simple experiences 
of contact with nature and the works of man. The 
sonnet " India " is one of the best examples. 

" Silent amidst unbroken silence deep 

Of dateless years, in loneliness supreme, 
She pondered patiently one mighty theme, 
And let the hours, uncounted, by her creep. 
The motionless Himalayas, the broad sweep 
Of glacial cataracts, great Ganges' stream 
All these to her were but as things that seem, 
Doomed all to pass, like phantoms viewed in sleep. 
Her history ? She has none scarce a name. 
The life she lived is lost in the profound 

Of time, which she despised ; but nothing mars 
The memory that, single, gives her fame 
She dreamed eternal dreams, and from the ground 
Still raised her yearning vision to the stars." 

Dr. Charles Woodruff Shields, of Princeton Uni- 
versity, has discerned in the history of Calvin and 
Servetus the elements of a historical drama, and has 
shaped the tragedy into a five-act play in blank 
verse, entitled " The Reformer of Geneva." The 
constructive skill displayed by the work is consid- 
erable, and in its strictly historical aspect minute 
accuracy has been observed. Of its diction, the best 
example is found in the last words spoken by Calvin 
after Servetus has been disposed of, and the triumph 
of the Reformation in Geneva is complete. 
" Mingle no praise of man with this high work 
Of God. Even Israel's law-giver, 
Because he smote the rock of Meriba 
In sinful anger, could not enter Canaan, 
But only viewed it from far Pisgah's top 
And died nnhonored in its sepulchre. 
So have ye seen like vehemence untam'd 
In him ye call the leader of your cause. 
For this he craves forgiveness of you all, 
In sight of God, of angels, and of men. 
Millions for this may call him tyrant, who 
Shall owe to him their liberty ; and though 
All Christian lands should be his monument, 
Let no man know his grave. 

The glory is 

Not ours. We are but shadows that o'ercloud it 
This living scene, and all that it portends, 
The earth and sky around us, and the pomps 
Of rising morn and sinking eve, are but 
The pageantry of one Creative Mind, 
Upheld and moved by one Eternal Will 
The glory give to One alone ! " 

If the work were kept at this elevation of expression 
throughout, it might pass muster as poetry ; unfor- 
tunately, it is for the most part mere prose, cut up 
into convenient lengths, and not even preserving 
mechanical regularity of form. 

In writing his " Trialogues " of the four seasons, 
Mr. William Griffith has evidently been inspired by 



the " Fleet Street Eclogues " of Mr. John Davidson, 
although both may doubtless point to an Elizabethan 
model. This is the sort of thing Mr. Griffith does, 
although not often as neatly as in the quoted passage.

"Nay ; come, pour out the ruddy ale,

" A moment near, a moment gone. 
Beneath ten thousand watching eyes, 
One thunderous rush rings out and dies 
And still the world moves on and on ; 

11 While sweeping down each azure road 
With banners fading one by one, 
The cohorts pass and here alone, 
I dream the solitude of God." 

The writer has also read Mr. William Watson's later 
poems, a little too attentively, it would seem, when 
we come upon such phrases as " those simple warrior 
lords" and "the ruined dream of Fontainebleau." 

Mention of two volumes of trifles may close this 
review of recent American verse. Mr. Tom Hall's 
" When Love Laughs " is made up of such things 
as " Going with Jack " a typical product of comic 
journalism. 

" The dressmaker 's late 

And she 's going with Jack I 
Ah me ! Such is Fate I 
The dressmaker 's late 
There 's the gown at the gate ! 

The smile has come back 

Though the dressmaker 's late 

She is going with Jack." 

Of " Summer " Mr. Hall tella us, 
" It is the season, filled with joy, 

When office boys' relations die ; 
While he who doth his kind employ 
Spends sleepless nights awondering why." 

If these are trifles light as air, those contained in 
" La Santa Yerba," by Mr. W. L. Shoemaker, are 
even lighter, for their substance is of the smoke of 
the " Great Plant." For example : 

" In Shakespeare's plays I think you '11 search in vain 
For any notice of tobacco ta'en, 
When in the theatres 'twas smoked, and when 
It had been praised by many learned men, 
And love of poets had begun to gain. 

" Did he the inspiring Indian weed disdain 
As impotent to aid his mighty brain ? 
Lo ! all things else are spread before our ken 
In Shakespeare's plays.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Professor Salisbury's " little book," 
as he calls it, on Walter Scott, in the 
" Famous Scots " series (imported by 
Scribners), is not different from what one would 
expect It must have been rather a task to compress 
that very full life into 150 fair-sized pages, but 
Professor Saintsbury is a veteran, and he has done 
his work with ease and even with a bit of room here 
or there to turn himself about a little. Of course 
it is the estimate of Scott's genius, or rather of his 
especial power, that is chiefly interesting. There 
is no denying that Scott has not of late quite held 
his literary position. Not that he is not read, that 
he has not been popular, that there have not been 
countless editions of the poems and the novels. But 
in the hundred years, almost, between Scott and 
ourselves there has come a change in poetry and in 
novel writing, so that what we think of as the highest 
poems and the greatest novels are very different 
from Scott's poems and novels. The work of the 
great men, of the Scotts and the Byrons of our own 
day, is very different, and hence many have felt 
that Scott's work was not great work. Professor 
Saintsbury recalls to mind many things that we shall 
remember, and suggests their importance. He is 
right in pointing out Scott's chief power : a large 
and sane knowledge of people and of life, a wonder- 
ful feeling for character, for nature, a thorough 
appreciation of humor and romance. In Scott's 
poems and in his novels we are struck by the same 
things : brilliant descriptions of scenery, remarkable 
fulness and exuberance of character, hurrying ac- 
tion and incident, romantic episodes ; if we turn to 
the poems or the novels, we shall always find these 
things in any one of them. Professor Saintsbury, 
however, does not especially mention some of the 
characteristics which Scott did not have, and one 
of these, it seems to us, was a thing which we have 
of late got to value a good deal : we mean the real- 
ization of the human soul in a tragic or pathetic 
situation. That was something that Scott rarely 
attempted. He often created the situations, but he 
rarely realized his character in them. Take Con- 
stance de Beverley : the situation would give a won- 
derful chance to a modern, but Scott does not realize 
the character at all. Then, as it may not be fair 
to take an example from a poem, take Lucie Ashton. 
Again we have a powerful situation ( in this case 
not invented by Scott), but here again Scott does 



not bring us to a realization of her tumult of heart. 
He tells us how Constance and Lucie looked and 
dressed, what they said and did, and so he does 
of Effie Deans, and Madge Wildfire, Clara Mow- 
bray, Amy Robsart, Hugh Redgauntlet, Roland 
Graeme at Loch Leven Castle, and many, many 
others who, either tragic figures or merely human 
beings in situations of keen human interest, rarely 
do more than look and dress and say and do. They 
rarely feel, or at least if they do we do not feel 
with them. Scott was great in his pictures of things 
that happen and places that we see, he had a won- 
derful power of appreciation and sympathy with 
humorous character, and sometimes even of the 
pathetic. But although he often conceived situations 
in which human nature must have been stirred to 
its depths, he rarely makes us realize the passion of 
which he speaks. Now this realization of intensity of 
life or of passion we have come to value greatly in 
the years between the " Waverleys " and ourselves. 
We have in many cases placed a value on absurd 
or grotesque manifestations of it. But at any rate 
we have valued it, and have accustomed ourselves 
to it. It may not be the greatest thing in the world, 
but we like it ; and when we read Scott we do not 
get it. It is perhaps too much to say that one is the 
looking at people from the outside, and the other is 
feeling with them as they are within. No one 
would entirely deny to Scott the power of sympathy 
with his creations ; but certainly he did not enter 
into their being at the moments of the crises of their 
fate, or at least he does not make us feel them 
thoroughly. We make a mistake if we allow this 
lack to discourage us in the presence of the other 
wealth which Scott has, of incident, character, de- 
scription, humor, romance. These things are cer- 
tainly the positive things about him, and Professor 
Saintsbury is not wrong in his very limited space in 
confining himself to them. 

" French Literature of To - day " 
. (Houghton) was apparently designed 

by the author, Madame Yetta Blaze 
de Bury, for persons not already much acquainted 
with the subject matter. This was wise on the 
whole. Others would find in the book a lack of 
several things that they might expect We will 
note a few points on the essay on Pierre Loti 
(chosen because it comes first in the book). His 
name is not Pierre Viaud ; his first book was not 
" Manage de Loti "; " Les Pecheurs d'Islande " is 
not the correct name of the novel discussed ; he was 
not elected to the Academy " in the full powers of 
youth," but at the age of forty-one ; " Fleurs 
d'Ennui " is not one of his last (sic) books, it is one 
of the earlier ones. These are not important mat- 
ters, but they are sufficient to put Madame Blaze de 
Bury out of the category of those who are thoroughly 
acquainted with the subjects on which they write, or 
who at least desire to present the matter as it really 
is rather than as it may well enough be. Such slips 
prepare one for looseness, such as the description of 



1898.]

Fatou-gaye's costume and coiffure, which, in spite 
of the " writes Loti," is not accurate ; for the fancy 
that Loti hears of Rarahu's death on returning to 
Papeete ; for the views ascribed to Gaud in thinking 
of Yann which, in spite of the quotation-marks, 
are very free recollections of the original. And this 
general mental attitude prepares one also to find at 
the end of the essay, " We pointed out . . . resem- 
blance between certain characteristics of his style 
and that of The'ophile Gautier," where what was 
said at the beginning was, " The analogy between 
Gautier and Loti, however, lies in the sestlietical 
temperament of both ; in their common worship of 
the sun," which is not a characteristic of style. 
These trivial matters would amount to nothing in 
work of real power and critical insight, but of such 
qualities we must confess we find here little trace. 
There are plenty of " modern ideas," but all hazy, 
vague, jumbled, and much as they might exist in 
the mind of one who had heard of them but had 
never thought them. The other essays seem like 
this on Pierre Loti, and the book therefore comes 
down to being the easy prattle of a lady who has 
read some of the French authors of the present day, 
who has heard a great deal of talk about " modern 
ideas," and who, somehow, has had opportunity to 
publish what she was inspired to write for some 
at least of these papers appeared in the English 
reviews. The book is interesting, but sadly unsound. 
The authors themselves are not accurately presented ; 
the ideas which furnish the standpoint from which 
they are viewed are not clearly conceived. We have 
no doubt that many may like to read these essays, 
for they are written in a rather sprightly mood ; 
but we doubt seriously if those who know the writ- 
ers discussed will find their ideas at all modified, or 
if those will come to know them who are not at 
present acquainted with them. 

Each summer has its pet golf-book. 
First, it was the Badminton ; last 
summer, Willy Park's book ; and this 
summer we think Mr. Whigham's " How to Play 
Golf " (H. S. Stone & Co.) has supplied the vade 
mecitm, the book that lies on every golf- club table 
and in the study of every enthusiast. It is true that 
this summer, just as laws become silent in the midst 
of arms, so also has the golfer retired from the 
front of public interest in favor of the soldier. Even 
Mr. Whigham himself, we have heard, put away 
his clubs and went to see the fighting. But now 
that the war is over, the turn of the golfer will 
come again. The papers, no longer full of exciting 
war-news, will be more carefully searched for news 
of the links. And as autumn comes on the real 
golfing season with us there will be more and 
more persons who want a golf-book. To them Mr. 
Whigham's treatise may be commended, for it is as 
good as another, and in some respects it is rather 
better. We do not think that anyone will be able 
to " learn the game " out of it much more easily 
than out of any other book. But the average man

who already plays a little will find a great deal that 
will be useful to him. There are photographs of 
players in action, for one thing, a dozen pictures 
each of the ways half-a-dozen champions drive, 
instead of one picture of the way you ought to drive 
yourself. The teaching of the game is on the whole 
made simpler and more practical, and is better and 
more fully illustrated in this book than in any other 
we know. The history of the game in this country 
and the sketch of amateur players abroad make 
good chapters. Golfers, perhaps more than most 
other kinds of " old gamesters," are much given to 
the gossip and the history of the game ; there are 
few sports so provocative of talk as golf. The chap- 
ter on laying out a course will be most easily made 
available by any club which means to spend a million 
dollars a hole. Others will have to do a good deal 
of contriving to make both ends meet. Still, there 
is really nothing recommended that is not good, 
though the book has perhaps a slightly discouraging 
effect on those who regard golf as a recreation 
rather than a highest duty. In fact, though it may 
seem a work of impertinence to commend a work by 
the amateur champion, we shall presume to say that 
golfers will here find the most useful book of the 
summer. 



Gladstone, " When a great man dies the nation 

the Man and mourns "; and that section of it which 

the Publicist. writes and makes books for the rest 
thriftily turns the occasion of mourning into one of 
profit. What we may term, we trust without dis- 
respect, the " Gladstone boom " is now on with a 
vengeance ; and among the more ephemeral and 
catch-penny manifestations of it is Mr. David Will- 
iamson's " Gladstone the Man " (New York : M. F. 
Mansfield). For the reader, if such there be, who 
knows nothing or next to nothing of Mr. Gladstone, 
Mr. Williamson's book may be said to contain a 
fair amount of information of the superficial and 
personal order which is, it is fair to add, all that 
its author proposes to furnish. " While other pens," 
he says, " have been busy recording and criticising 
the political acts of Mr. Gladstone, mine will be the 
more grateful task of portraying him ... as the 
man whose personal character is esteemed by polit- 
ical friend and foe alike." But the book, however 
looked at, is a slight thing at best, bearing the ear- 
marks of hurry and scant preparation. There are 
a few illustrations, mainly from photographs that 
have already done service in the pictorial journals. 
A solider book than Mr. Williamson's, though 
still a biography of the merely descriptive and laud- 
atory sort, is the new edition, revised and brought 
to date, of Mr. Walter Jerrold's " W. E. Gladstone, 
England's Great Commoner" (Revell). Unlike 
Mr. Williamson, Mr. Jerrold deals for the most part 
with Gladstone's public career which is, of course, 
the side of his life we are most concerned to know 
about. Mr. Jerrold is extremely chary of venturing 
an opinion of his own as to anything his hero did or 
wrote so chary, indeed, that he may seem to the

reader to stick to mere recital from prudential mo- 
tives. We are likely, however, to have enough 
criticism and even depreciation of Mr. Gladstone 
ere long, when the inevitable reaction against the 
current flood of overcharged laudation and lamenta- 
tion seta in. Fortunately, we shall always have 
Mr. Bryce's fine study (already noticed in our col- 
umns) to appeal to as a standard of appreciation. 
Mr. Jerrold's book contains a liberal sprinkling of 
wood-cuts, and it may be read with profit and en- 
joyment by those in need of an elementary sketch 
of " England's Great Commoner." 

It is much to be hoped, from the pop- 
ular as well as the professional point 
of view, that some such works on the 
various campaigns undertaken by the American 
forces in the Spanish war shall be published as Mr. 
Lionel James's " The Indian Frontier War, 1897 " 
(Scribner), and Mr. Winston L. Spencer Churchill's 
"Malakand Field Force, 1897" (Longmans). 
These books are to be taken together as furnishing 
a complete and minutely detailed account of the 
operations of the British armies last year in India, 
against the hill tribes, Pathans and others, during 
their turbulence as a result of Moslem fanaticism. 
The fact that the heathen were armed with modern 
rifles, in some respects inferior to those of their 
more civilized foe, is in striking contradiction 
to the relative positions of the Spanish and the 
American volunteers ; but some exceedingly inter- 
esting parallels are to be drawn between such a 
charge as that of the " Gay Gordons " at Dargai 
last October, and the storming and capture of El 
Caney and San Juan last July by the American 
regulars, black and white, and the " rough riders." 
Both must serve to assure Mr. H. W. Wilson that 
his fears lest the fighting qualities of the race have 
deteriorated are unfounded. Now that the fighting 
is fairly over, it will be worth while to study the 
means by which Englishmen on the extreme frontier 
of the Empire are provided for under the super- 
vision of trained officers and men, it may keep 
the United States from sending their men out with 
some expectation that the deficiency in rations is to 
be made up by a superfluity in clothing. In any 
event, the frankness of Messrs. James and Churchill 
in disclosing all the weaknesses developed during 
the campaign, and the means taken to remedy them, 
is worthy our emulation, not less than the clearness 
of the narratives. 

In The Cheverels of Cheverel 
Manor " ( Longmans ), we have a 
d manner*. | )u jg e j ; o f eighteenth-century letters, 
written, for the most part, by Hester, Lady Newdi- 
gate, and addressed to Sir Roger Newdigate, of 
Arbury in Warwickshire. The volume is so named 
from the fact that in Arbury we may find the original 
of George Eliot's Cheverel Manor, Sir Roger and 
his wife being the models for Sir Christopher and 
Lady Cheverel, while their protfyS, Sally Shilton, 



was the Caterina of " Mr. GilfiTs Love-Story." The 
Arbury history was well-known in the Evans family, 
for Robert Evans, the father of the novelist, was 
bailiff on the estate, and his first wife not George 
Eliot's mother had been a u friend and servant " 
of the household. The bailiff's little daughter, accom- 
panying him on his business errands, had constant 
glimpses of the great house, and heard, doubtless, 
much gossip of the great people ; what with recol- 
lection and with tradition, therefore, she possessed 
ample material, in later years, for her charming and 
pathetic story. The interest of the letters, however, 
lies not at all in their testimony to the novelist's 
truth, but in the details which they give of eighteenth- 
century life and manners, and in their portrayal of 
that sprightly and sensible woman, the writer. One 
may read here of London, Buxton, and Brighton, 
as they existed a hundred years ago ; of English 
lodging-houses and inns and country roads of the 
same period ; of long journeys by coach and of short 
ones by chair ; and of some characteristic dinners 
and suppers, described in all leisure and simplicity. 
One may read also of a lady of quality, who takes 
the world with much wisdom and no little wit, who 
manages her affairs with a firm hand, and who 
makes to Sir Roger a very tactful and comfortable 
wife. The book is edited by Lady Newdigate- 
Newdegate, and the illustrations are from family 
portraits, which number among them two Romneys 
and a Reynolds. For frontispiece there is the 
fine figure of the old baronet an English gentle- 
man and scholar, to whom, we may suppose, the 
publication of these letters was an unimagined 
indignity. 

It is in complete accord with history 
as we are accustomed to read it, that 
Miss Katharine Prescott Wormeley 
should have republished her letters from the head- 
quarters of the United States Sanitary Commission 
during the peninsular campaign in Virginia in 1862, 
should have prefaced the work with a somewhat 
detailed account of the beginnings of the Sanitary 
Commission and the good it did, and have placed 
the whole at the disposal of her countrymen in time 
to be useful in the recent war with Spain, only to 
have the mistakes she would have taught them to 
avoid repeated with such additions as incompetence 
could invent. It is this, and not the human charity 
and wholesome lack of morbidness in the book 
('< The Cruel Side of War," Roberts) that makes 
it such sorrowful reading. True, the fevers and 
wounds of the War of the Rebellion were not the 
fevers and wounds of the war with Spain ; but the 
means provided for the care of the sick and wounded 
in the former case would have saved many lives and 
infinite suffering had there been the same awaken- 
ing to the needs of the gallant men who have with- 
held nothing from their duty to the country during 
these last few months. Apparently, it is becoming 
the settled policy of the nation to prepare those 
entering its service for the reception of pensions.

The first volume of a new series of 
biographies entitled American Men 
of Energy " (Putnam) is the life of 
Benjamin Franklin, from the pen of Mr. Edward 
Robins. Excellent judgment is shown in the space 
allotment for the different portions of Franklin's 
diversified career, and the treatment is both fair and 
accurate. Although designedly a " popular " biog- 
raphy, it has decidedly more merit than such books 
commonly possess. The author knows his Franklin, 
and he tells the facts forcefully, although at times 
in language a little frothy. The lessons to be derived 
from the Autobiography, the only case in which 
a self-made man has left us the recipe of his mak- 
ing, are not overlooked in the summary of his 
character. Franklin was an ideal " man of energy," 
and it is to be hoped his successors in the series may 
be as wisely chosen and as well handled. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Chautauqua books for the coming year, five in 
number as usual, have just been sent out by Messrs. 
Flood & Vincent, of Meadville. Two of them are new 
books, the other three are revised editions of earlier 
publications. In the latter category come Alexander 
WinchelPs " Walks and Talks in the Geological Field," 
revised by Professor Frederick Starr; "Europe in the 
Nineteenth Century," by Professor Harry Pratt Judson; 
and " From Chaucer to Tennyson," by Professor Henry 
A. Beers. The new books are " Men and Manners of 
the Eighteenth Century," by Miss Susan Hale, and 
" Twenty Centuries of English History," by Mr. James 
Richard Joy. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " First Lessons in 
German," by Mr. Sigmon M. Stern; "First Lessons in 
French," by Messrs. Baptiste Me'ras and S. M. Stern; 
Schiller's " Wilhelm Tell," edited by Professor Arthur 
H. Palmer; and Musset's " Histoire d'un Merle Blanc," 
edited by Misses Agues Cointat and H. Isabelle Will- 
iams. Other modern language text-books are About's 
" Roi des Montagues," edited by Dr. Thomas Logie 
(Heath) ; Taine's " Introduction k 1'Histoire de la Lit- 
te"rature Anglaise," edited by Mr. Irving Babbitt 
(Heath); and " Un Peu de Tout" (Jenkins), a sort of 
phrase-book edited by M. F. Julien. 

" Romance and Realism of the Southern Gulf Coast," 
by Miss Minnie Walter Myers, is a very brief and pop- 
ular history and description, published by Messrs. Robert 
Clarke & Co. It contains much more romance than 
realism in its sketches and stories of the Indians, the 
explorers, the Creoles, the Acadians, of New Orleans 
and Beauvoir. Though scrappy and amateurish, the 
book will probably interest many, especially those famil- 
iar with the scenes and characters described. 

" Applied Physiology," by Dr. Frank Overton (Amer- 
ican Book Co.), is published in two parts, respectively 
intended for primary and intermediate grades. As is 
usual in books of this sort, an obtrusive amount of atten- 
tion is devoted to the effects of alcohol upon the human 
system. As an example of the writer's style we make 
one quotation : " While alcohol is harming a man, it 
makes him feel good." 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" A Brief Course in Qualitative Analysis," by Professor 
Ernest A. Congdon, is published by Messrs. Holt & Co. 

" The Story of the Mind," by Professor James Mark 
Baldwin, is an acceptable addition to the " Library of 
Useful Stories " published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

Burke's " Letter to a Noble Lord," edited for school 
use by Professor Albert H. Smyth, is published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. in their series of " Standard En- 
glish Classics." 

A volume of " Selections from the Prose and Poetry 
of Walt Whitman " has been edited by Dr. Oscar L. 
Triggs, and published in very attractive style by Messrs. 
Small, Maynard, & Co. 

The " Life and Administration of Sir Robert Eden," 
governor of Maryland from 1768 to 1776, by Dr. 
Bernard C. Steiner, is published as a " University 
Study " by the Johns Hopkins Press. 

" Armazindy," with other and shorter poems, may be 
found in Volume IX., just issued, of the uniform edi- 
tion of Mr. J. W. Riley's writings, now nearly com- 
pleted by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" A Book of Verses for Children," compiled by Mr. 
Edward Verrall Lucas, is a happy selection of classified 
poems and fragments, from a great variety of good au- 
thors, published in exceedingly tasteful form by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. 

"Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie," by Mr. Timothy 
Holmes, and "William Stokes: His Life and Work," 
by Mr. William Stokes, his son, are two additions to the 
" Masters of Medicine " series, published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" A Mechanico-Physiological Theory of Organic Evo- 
lution " translated from the German of Herr Carl von 
Nageli by Messrs. V. A. Clark and F. A. Waugh, is 
issued by the Open Court Publishing Co. in their " Re- 
ligion of Science Library." 

The Macmillan Co. have bought the old established 
publishing business of Messrs. Richard Bentley & Son, 
of London. All Messrs. Bentley's present publications, 
and those heretofore issued, will hereafter be published 
by the Macmillan Co., in London and New York. 

Messrs. Luzac & Co. send us a translation of the 
Singalese " Ummagger Jataka " (The Story of the 
Tunnel), made by Mr. T. B. Yatawara, a native Indian 
official. It is a fourteenth century work, rich in human 
interest, and presenting a vivid picture of the customs, 
manners, and institutions of a bygone age in India. 

" Cuba at a Glance " (R. H. Russell) is a pamphlet 
compilation, historical and descriptive, by Miss Emma 
Kautt'man and Miss Anne O'Hagan, issued under the 
auspices of the Cuban Junta. It is a vehement and now 
somewhat futile attack on Spanish rule. As appendix it 
has war maps of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. 

Portraits of Turgue'nieff and Herr Bjornson appear 
as the respective frontispieces of two new volumes, 
Scandinavian and Russian in contents, of the series en- 
titled " Stories by Foreign Authors," published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Eight volumes of this 
attractive series have now been published, and two more 
will bring it to completion. 

" A Library Dictionary of the French and English 
Languages," by Mr. Ferdinand E. A. Gasc, is published 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. in a volume of nearly a 
thousand three-columned pages. It is the result of over

Under the general title of " The Churchman's 
Library," the Macmillan Co. will publish a series of 
volumes, designed rather for the laity thau for clerical 
readers, upon subjects " occupying the attention of 
church people at the present time." Over twenty vol- 
umes have already been arranged for, of which four are 
now almost ready for publication. 

" Appletons' Dictionary of Greater New York " comes 
to us for 1898 with the revisions made necessary by the 
enlargement of the city with which it deals. The " dic- 
tionary " plan is probably better than any other for such 
a guide-book, and we wish that every large city in the 
country might be provided with so useful and conven- 
ient a book for the information of visitors.

PRESS COMMENTS ON THE PASSING OF 
- THE "CHAP=BOOK." 



From the Instead of the number of the " Chap- 

CHICAQO Book " which in ordinary course would 

TIMES- have been current yesterday, announce- 

HERALD, ment is made that THE DIAL, the other 

July 17. literary semi-monthly of Chicago, will 

hereafter appear for both periodicals. 
The " Chap-Book," which recently com- 
pleted its fifth year, is thus merged in 
THE DIAL, now in its nineteenth year. 
. . . THE DIAL is accorded the highest 
place among American literary and 
critical magazines. 

From the Good-bye to the "Chap-Book"! The 

BOSTON little deciduous periodical is no more, 

TRANSCRIPT, absorbed in the steady-going, responsi- 
July 18. ble, and reliable DIAL. It is the fate of 

all lively young periodicals established 
on lines which are not parallel with 
those of old established favorites either 
to die or to become affiliated with those 
which are. . . . THE DIAL is certainly 
a well-poised, unprejudiced, and schol- 
arly journal, readable and guiltless of 
twaddle. 

From the The passing of the " Chap-Book " is 

INDEPEND- announced. THE DIAL has bought the 

ENT, N. Y., publication, and now that the " Critic " 

July 21. has changed from the form of a weekly 

paper to that of a monthly magazine 

THE DIAL practically is in possession of 

its own field of literary journalism. 

From the The " Chap-Book," which seemed to 

INDIANAP- have reached the very summit of pros- 

OL1S NEWS, perity, has published its own obituary 

July 27. notice. The sprightly publication has 

been sold to THE DIAL, which will fill 

out all the " Chap-Book's " unexpired 

subscriptions. 

From the The " Chap-Book " has been pur- 

ADVANCE, chased by THE DIAL, . . . which will 
Chicago, g a i n by the consolidation a new and 

July 28. important constituency. The change of 

the " Critic " from a weekly to a monthly 
leaves THE DIAL in practical possession 
of the field of distinctively literary jour- 
nalism in this country. 

From the THE DIAL has absorbed all that the 

TOPEKA Chap-Book " once was without in any 

ADVOCATE way losing the worth and dignity which 
AND NEWS, has made it so truly deserving of the 
August 10. kind words that eminent literary men 

have said of it. 

From the The passing of the " Chap-Book " has 

STANDARD, aroused much comment in journalistic 
Chicago, circles. Ever since the unique sheet 

July 30. first appeared ... it has contributed 

to the enlivenment of literary America. 

. . . Now it has been merged with THE 

DIAL, and is no more. 



From the The "Chap-Book" has become 

NORTH- merged in THE DIAL, which is one of 

WESTERN the best purely critical papers in the 
CHRISTIAN United States. . . . The change should 
ADVOCATE, not prove unsatisfactory to subscribers, 
Augusts. w ho will find THE DIAL catholic in 

taste, unbiased in criticism, and inter- 
esting in matter. 

From the The " Chap-Book " has been trans- 

OUTLOOK, ferred to THE DIAL, which has long 
New York, been one of the most scholarly and 

August 13. dignified of American literary journals. 

The influence of THE DIAL in the Cen- 
tral West has been steadily in the direc- 
tion of the most thorough scholarship 
and the best literature. . . . THE DIAL 
represents a very influential body of 
Ik people in the city of Chicago, and a 

growing constituency throughout the 
West, and its success is an indication of 
the spread of genuine culture. 

From the Word comes from Chicago that the 

NEW YORK Chap-Book " has been absorbed by 
TIMES, THE DIAL. This is a curious combina- 

July 23. tion, and many puzzling conjectures will 

arise from it. ... Some will regard 
the transaction as a surrender of the 
claims of " decadent " literature to the 
more robust and healthful spirit of lit- 
erary journalism. Others will expect 
to see THE DIAL clothe itself in dilet- 
tanteism and bloom forth in paroxysms 
of rainbow literature. We feel quite 
sure, however, that this last will not 
happen. The editor of THE DIAL prob- 
ably knows what his readers will toler- 
ate. People are obviously tired of quaint 
conceits in critical writing; they desire 
to have their news and criticism of books 
presented in as simple and conscientious 
a form as ... the news of the stock 
market. Reviews of books should be as 
timely as are editorial comments on cur- 
rent events, and they should be written 
from the same elevated and responsible 
standpoint. 

From the Instead of the " Chap-Book " for 

SPRINGFIELD July 15, comes the announcement that 
UNION, that semi-monthly has been merged into 

July 31. THE DIAL, which publication subscrib- 

ers to the " Chap-Book " will receive 
hereafter. . . . Subscribers for the lit- 
tle Western magazine that is now of the 
past will find themselves in harmony 
with its successor. 

From the The " Chap-Book " has passed into 

CONQREGA- the hands of THE DIAL, which will be 
TIONALIST, continued as a literary and critical pa- 
Boston, p er> with the wider constituency which 
July 28. the consolidation gives.

WAR MEMORIES OF AN ARMY CHAPLAIN. By Henry Clay Trumbull, D.D. 

With 14 full-page illustrations by Gilbert Gaul, Carlton T. Chapman, R. F. Zogbaum, T. de Thulstrup, 

I. W. Taber, Alice Barber Stephens, A. C. Redwood, and C. D. Weldon. Crown 8vo, 82.00. 

CONTENTS : Place and Work of a Regimental Chaplain. Army Chapel* and Religion* Service*. Disclosures of the 
Soldier Heart. A Chaplain's Sermons. Pastoral Work. Influence of the Home Mail. Devotion to the Flag. Deserters. 
Soldier Grave* and Burials. Under a Flag of Trace. Prison Experiences. Glimpse* of General Grant. Linking* with 
the Navy. Seeing Slavery and Emancipation. 

As the author says in his Preface, there have been many volumes written about the movements of the armies 
and about the principal commanders in our Civil War, but the thoughts and feelings of the private soldier in 
active service are almost unknown ground to the average civilian. It is this individual, human side of the army, 
from a standpoint of peculiar acquaintance and sympathy, with which Dr. Trumbull's vivid reminiscences deal. 

THE DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY IN GASES. ByJ. J.Thomson, M. A., 

F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Physics in the University of Cambridge. 12mo, 81.00 net. 

Professor Thomson is well known both here and in England through his writings on various matters of 
abstruse physical science. In this volume, containing four lectures delivered at the Princeton Sesquicentennial 
Celebration, he has made a very acute and suggestive contribution to current scientific thought. 

READY SEPTEMBER 4: 

THE GOEDE VROUW OF MANA-HA-TA. By Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer. 

At Home and in Society. 1609-1760. Small 8vo, 82.00. 

CONTENTS: Two Dutch Colonies in America. Women of the 17th Century. Prominent Pioneer Women. First 
Settlement. Homes of the Settlers. Habits, Amusements, and Law*. Rensselaers of the Manor. Der Colonie Nieu 
Nederlands. New York vs. New Amsterdam. Passing of the Pioneen. The Dutch and their Neighbors. New York in 
Infancy. The Pirate and his Escapades. Society under the English Rule. Wedding-bells and Candle-cup*. Jame* 
Alexander. My Lady of "Petticoat Lane." Petticoats and Politics. New York in 1732. Matches, Batches, and 
Despatches. New York "in the Forties." The Last of the Dutch Matrons. 

It is somewhat extraordinary that, with all the literature on the people of Old New York, we have so little of 
these pioneers' household affairs, of tibe women's influence, social customs and manners. Mrs. Van Rensselaer's 
book presents an animated and exhaustive history, in a consecutive narrative, of the intimate side of that life, 
from the first settlement down to the death of the last Dutch Matron. Her facts have been gleaned from hitherto 
inaccessible family papers and from many rare and curious volumes, giving the work a special personal interest 
to the descendants of these families as well as to the historical student. 

ANTIGONE, and Other Portraits of Women ("Voyageiues" ). By Paul Bourget. 

Translated from the French by WILLIAM MARCH ANT. 12mo, 81.50. 

According to the ingenious idea which binds these stories together, they contain portraits of various women 
encountered in the journeys of which the author is so fond. Each is the centre of a dramatic narrative, and each 
is drawn with the charming and sympathetic insight that M. Bourget alone brings to the study of feminine psychology.

CONTENTS : The Non-Combatant. The Way of an Election. The Moment of Clear Vision. The Conscience of a 
Business Man. Johnny's Job. The Scab. 

Miss French is not only one of the most popular of American story-writers, but one of the most thoroughly 
American in spirit. She has done for the Middle West what Miss Jewett and Miss Wilkins have done for New 
England in faithful characterization. The stories in this volume all turn to some extent on the relation of 
employers and employed. They are, however, stories of men in the widest sense, and leave a cheery, wholesome, 
and optimistic impression of the men who really do American work the backbone of the Western community.

WORLDLY WAYS AND BY-WAYS. By Eliot Gregory ( An Idler"). 

The " Idler's " papers on the philosophy of fashion, folly, and foibles, as exhibited in American society at home 
and abroad, have already attracted wide-spread attention in the columns of the Evening Post. They are now 
revised and united in book form, and make a volume of unique kind and flavor one that the sociologist as well 
as the society devotee may read with profit and pleasure for its shrewdness, its point, its sympathetic quality and 
the fundamental seriousness underlying its sprightly treatment.

SCRIBNER'S NEWEST BOOKS. 



JUST PUBLISHED: 



ENCYCLOP/EDIA OF SACRED 
THEOLOGY. 

By Abraham Kuy per, D.D., Free University, Amster- 
dam. Translated from the Dutch by Rev. J. HEND- 
RICK DE VRIES, M.A. With an introduction by Pro- 
fessor BENJAMIN B. WARFIELD, D.D., LL.D. 8vo, $4. 
This work, admirably translated by M. de Vries, dis- 
cusses all those questions which concern the place of 
theology among the sciences and the nature of theology 
as a science with a " principium " of its own. Dr. Kuyper 
is probably to-day the most considerable figure in both 
political and ecclesiastical Holland, and this work shows 
" the depth of his insight, the breadth of his outlook, 
the thoroughness of his method, the comprehensiveness 
of his survey, the intensity of his conviction, the elo- 
quence of his language, the directness of his style, the 
pith and wealth of his illustrations, the force, complete- 
ness, convincingness, of his presentation." 

CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES. 

By John Jay Chapman, author of " Emerson, and 
Other Essays." 12mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Chapman's new book is a social and political essay of 
great penetration and is written with much pungency. It 
consists of an elaborate presentation, from various points of 
view, of the idea that man is fundamentally unselfish its 
deductions being thoroughly practical. The volume contains 
five chapters: "Politics," "Society," "Education," "De- 
mocracy," and " Government." 

Already published : EMERSON, AND OTHER ESSAYS. 
12mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Henry James speaks of the title essay in this volume a second 
time in Literature as follows : "This essay is the most effective critical 
attempt made in the United States, or, I should sappose, anywhere, 
really to get near the philosopher of Concord."

THE DEATH AND RESURREC- 
TION OF JESUS CHRIST. 

By Edmund Stapfer, Professor in the Faculty of 
Protestant Theology at Paris. Third volume com- 
pleting the series. Translated by LOUISE SEYMOUR 
HOUGHTON. 12 mo, $1.25. 

This concludes the series which the author has devoted to 
the person, authority, and work of Jesus. His aim is, as in 
the former volumes, not so much to relate the external life of 
Jesus as to discern his thought, to grasp and reverently study 
what went on in his soul amid the events crowded into that 
last week, concerning the outward aspects of which whole 
libraries have already been written. 

Already published, by the same author each translated by 
LOUISE SEYMOUR HOUGHTON. 12mo, $1.25. 

JESUS CHRIST BEFORE HIS MINISTRY. 

JESUS CHRIST DURING HIS MINISTRY. 

" So lucid, so learned a study that it is distinctly a valuable addition 
to the already priceless literature that clusters around the name of the 
world's Saviour." Christian Advocate. 

"It seeks to concentrate all rays into one light, and that light it 
presents most wonderfully, most truly, as the Light of the World." 
The Churchman. 

THEORIES OF THE WILL. 

By Archibald Alexander, author of "A Theory of 
Conduct," " Some Problems of Philosophy," etc. 
12mo, $1.50. 

CONTENTS : Theories of the Will in the Socratic Period. 
Stoic and Epicurean Theories. In Christian Theology. 
In British Philosophy from Bacon to Reid. From Descartes 
to Leibnitz. In German Philosophy from Kant to Leutze. 

Mr. Alexander's new volume gives a concise account of the 
development of this conception from the earliest days of 
Greek thought to the middle of the present century. The 
author's purpose is to introduce in this way a constructive 
explanation of voluntary action. 

THE PROBLEMS OF 
PHILOSOPHY. 

By John Qrier Hibben, Ph.D., Professor of Logic in 
Princeton University, author of " Inductive Logic." 
An Introduction to the Study of Philosophy. 12mo,

Historic Towns of New England. 

Edited by LYMAN P. POWELL. With over 150 illustrations. 8vo. 

CONTENTS : Portland, Rutland, Salem, Boston, Cambridge, Concord, 
Plymouth, Cape Cod Towns, Deerfield, Newport, Providence, Hartford, 
New Haven. 

These papers, while written in popular style, are in each case the 
work of a writer having authoritative knowledge of the historic details 
and incidents considered, and the book will form a contribution of dis- 
tinct and permanent value to the history of New England and of the 
country. 

The Romance of the House

By ALETHEA WEIL, author of " The Story of Venice," " Vit- 
toria Colonna," " Two Doges of Venice," etc. With illus- 
trations reproduced chiefly from contemporary sources. Two 
volumes. 12mo. 

The history of the present royal house of Italy is full of romantic inci- 
dents, but, as far at least as English-speaking readers are concerned, it 
is thus far but little known. Mme. Weil has had at her command in the 
preparation of these volumes a large mass of original information, partly 
in the shape of manuscripts and archives that have not heretofore been 
brought into print. The sketches that have been based upon her re- 
searches, while gracefully written and popular in style, are, therefore, 
the result of careful historic investigation.

The clever author of "Colonial Homesteads " has utilized her expe- 
riences in Europe and her literary training for the preparation of a series 
of papers devoted to certain historic places with which are to be con- 
nected the names of characters familiar in history and literature. Mrs. 
Terhune's descriptions are in each case the result of personal observation. 

Alfred Tennyson. 

His Homes, his Friends, and his Work. By ELISABETH 
LUTHER GARY. With illustrations in photogravure. Large

SPANISH LITERATURE. 

By JAMES FITZ MAURICE-KELLY, Member of the Spanish 
Academy. A new volume in THE LITERATURES or THE 
WORLD SERIES, edited by EDMUND GOSSE. Uniform with 
" Ancient Greek Literature," " French Literature," " Mod- 
ern English Literature," and " Italian Literature." 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

" The introductory chapter has been written to remind readers that 
the great figures of the silver age Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Quintilian 
were Spanish as well as Romans. It further aims at tracing The 
stream of literature from its Roman fount to the channels of the Gothic 
period ; at defining the limits of Arabic and Hebrew influence on Spanish 
letters ; at refuting the theory which assumes the existence of immemo- 
rial romances, and at explaining the interaction between Spanish on 
the one side, and Provencal and French on the other. Spain's litera- 
ture extends over some hundred and fifty years, from the accession of 
Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV. This period has been treated 
as it deserves, at greater length than any other." From the Preface. 

THE SCIENTIFIC MEMOIRS OF THOMAS 
HENRY HUXLEY. 

Edited by Prof. MICHAEL FOSTER, M.A., M.D., LL.D., 
F.R.S., and by Prof. E. RAT LANKESTER, M.A., LL.D., 
F.R.S. In four volumes. Volume I., with thirty-two plates 
and a photogravure portrait. 8vo, cloth, $7.50. (Edition 
limited to one hundred sets.) 

" It was a true insight which led Professors Foster and Ray Lankester, 
the editors of these memoirs, to undertake the work which, begun in 
this large volume of over six hundred pages, is expected to extend to 
four volumes in all. No fitter memorial to Huxley could be imagined, 
no more appropriate attempt to uncover to general view the broad 
foundations upon which his claim to fame and reputation must rest in 
the future could be conceived, than to publish in collective form the 
papers which, for well-nigh half a century of scientific activity, he con- 
tributed to scientific societies and scientific periodicals. . . . These 
memoirs have left us with a very decided impression : we have been 
introduced, as it were, afresh to Huxley the specialist, Fellow of the 
Royal Society at twenty-six, its Royal Medallist at twenty-seven, a 
mind-producing work of the first order, a figure which looms large and 
impressive on the imagination." London Spectator. 

THE EARTH AND SKY. 

By EDWARD S. HOLDEN. APPLETONS' HOME -READING 

BOOKS. 12mo, boards, 25 cts. net. 

This book is the first of a series of three volumes treating of the 
leading phases of astronomical knowledge, and designed for use as a 
reading book in the school as well as in the home. It is written in a 
simple, conversational style to show first that the earth is not flat, but 
that it is an immense globe, and next its situation in space. The sun 
and moon are next treated, and finally the stars in their courses. The 
young child is shown how he can learn things for himself, and nothing 
is presented too difficult for him to comprehend.

THE HOUSE OF HIDDEN TREASURE. 

A Novel. By MAXWELL GRAY, author of " The Silence of 

Dean Maitland," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This novel is regarded by the author as her most important and sig- 
nificant work since " The Silence of Dean Maitland." The scene is laid 
for the most part in England, and the story opens in the sixties. " There 
is a strong and pervading charm in this new novel," says the London 
Chronicle in the course of a long and enthusiastic review of the book, 
which is characterized as a picture of " a woman's ideal," and free from 
morbid thoughts and theories. The London Spectator gays: "'The 
Silence of Dean Maitland ' was a very popular novel, and we cannot see 
why ' The House of the Hidden Treasure ' should not rival the success 
of its forerunner." 

DAVID HARUM. 

A Story of American Life. By EDWARD N. WESTCOTT. 12mo, 

cloth, $1.50. 

It has been often pointed out that the most successful American 
novels have been local studies, genre pictures of particular types and 
places, like those of New Orleans by Mr. Cable, of New England by 
Miss Wilkins and Miss Jewett, of the Northwest by Mr. Hamlin Oar- 
land, and the Southwest by Mr. Owen Wister. Now and then it has 
happened that a new writer has appeared and has gained general recog- 
nition by the vividness and force of one local study, like Mr. Howe with 
"The Story of a Country Town." In the case of "David Harum" the 
conditions have been similar. The author has saturated himself with 
local atmosphere, and he has observed the quaint and delightful type 
presented in his book until he has been able to offer a picture so vivid, 
true, and irresistibly humorous that we recognize at once the addition 
of a new figure to the permanent genre studies in American fiction. 

A REMARKABLE SUCCESS. 

EVELYN 1NNES. 
A Story. By GEORGE MOORE, author of " Esther Waters," 

etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" The book is, indeed, most conscientiously constructed. There is 
no hasty work to be detected in it. It is the fruit of three long years 
of unremitting work. There are passages in it of remarkable power, 
and its author's touch is everywhere both firm and sure. ... It shows 
no traces of the grossness of phrase and brutality of thought that have 
so often jarred upon us." New York Bookman. 

THE TERROR. 

A Romance of the French Revolution. By FELIX GRAB, 
author of " The Reds of the Midi." Translated by Mrs. 
CATHARINE A. JANVIER. 16mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" If Felix Gras had never done any other work than this novel it 
would at once give him a place in the front rank of the writers of to-day. 
. . . ' The Terror ' is a story that deserves to be widely read, for, while 
it is of thrilling interest, holding the reader's attention closely, there is 
about it a literary quality that makes it worthy of something more than 
a careless perusal. " Brooklyn Eagle.

LITERARY NOTES . 185 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

A few months ago, there was widespread dis- 
cussion concerning the probable effects of the 
then impending war with Spain upon the produc- 
tion of books in the United States. Arguments 
were adduced in plenty upon both sides of the 
question, and it was stoutly maintained, on the 
one hand, that bookmaking would receive a new 
stimulus from the clash of arms, and, on the 
other, that the energies of the public would 
be diverted from the reading of books, that the 
activities of authors and publishers would be to 
a considerable extent paralyzed by the moral and 
economic shock of the conflict. The question 
thus warmly debated is now by way of getting 
answered, and the list of forthcoming books, 
compiled from the announcements of American 
publishing houses, and printed in the present 
issue of THE DIAL, settles the debate most 
emphatically in favor of the contention that 
book production would be increased rather than 
lessened by reason of the newly awakened self- 
consciousness of the American people. Had the 
outcome of the war been less favorable to our 
arms, or had the strife been unduly prolonged, 
a different answer might have been given to the 
question, but the answer which we actually have 
to record is in the highest degree satisfactory, 
and it is evident that a season of almost unpre- 
cedented activity in book-publishing awaits us, 
and is, indeed, close at hand. The list that we 
published in our announcement number of a year 
ago was the most extensive that we had ever 
brought together, comprising, as it did, well 
over a thousand titles ; but even that list is this 
year exceeded to the extent of two or three hun- 
dred additional titles. We are justified in con- 
gratulating all concerned authors, publishers, 
and readers upon this showing, and in pre- 
dicting that culture as far as it is affected 
by the statistics of book-production is about 
to " hum " as it never did before in what Whitman 
called " these States." 

With so rapidly growing a list to choose from, 
it becomes every year increasingly difficult, in 
such a prospectus as this, to single out the few 
works of greater importance to mention of which 
we are necessarily restricted. The invidiousness 
of such a selection becomes more and more 



160 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 t 



evident, and every reader of this brief forecast 
will doubtless find in the full list as it appears 
further on in our pages some titles more inter- 
esting to him personally than those that are 
mentioned just here ; while the coming year, 
no less than the years past, will be sure to have 
its surprises in the shape of the important books 
that will appear almost unheralded. For one 
thing, we may say that no one book in prospect 
is entitled to be styled " the book of the year," 
in the sense in which that name has been 
deserved, in past years, by such works as the 
Life of Tennyson, and the Letters of Lowell 
or Matthew Arnold. Yet, in spite of this state- 
ment, there are doubtless many individual read- 
ers who will find in this list the titles of books 
which to them personally are of the first im- 
portance. 

Having said this much in the way of general 
observation, it remains for us to pick out a few 
titles that seem particularly deserving of special 
mention . In the department of biography, there 
is probably no more important work announced 
than Professor Knapp's long-heralded " Life 
of George Borrow." The authorized life of 
Alphonse Daudet, by his son ; the study of Count 
Tolstoy's life, by Mr. G. H. Ferris ; the " Life 
and Character of General Grant," by Mr. Ham- 
lin Garland ; and Dr. Hale's rambling remin- 
iscences of "James Russell Lowell and his 
Friends," are surely among the books that 
will be awaited with the greatest interest. In his- 
tory, Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge's " Story of the 
Revolution " will command a wide audience, 
as will also the late C. A. Dana's " Recollec- 
tions of the Civil War." An announcement 
of peculiar interest is "The Underground Rail- 
road from Slavery to Freedom," by Mr. W. H. 
Siebert, which will be the first exhaustive 
account of that movement. As for books about 
the recent war, about the new territories over 
which the United States is to assume control, 
and about the achievements of the American 
navy they are almost legion, and it would be 
invidious to a few to the exclusion of the rest. 

In the more serious walks of literature, we 
have, furthermore, many other titles of great 
attractiveness. Prof essorGoldwin Smith's" The 
United Kingdom," Mr. Benjamin Kidd's (< The 
Control of the Tropics," Mr. H. J. Ford's 
44 The Rise and Growth of American Politics," 
and a translation of Gneist's " History of the 
English Constitution," are a few titles in one 
department. Mr. A. H. Savage Landor's 4< Our 
Expedition to Tibet " will probably take the 
lead among works of travel and exploration, 



followed closely by Mr. Sven Hedin's " A Jour- 
ney across Asia," Mr. Edward Fitzgerald's 
" In the Highest Andes," Mr. Eivind Astrup's 
44 With Peary near the Pole," and, with a flavor 
more of literature than of learning, A Cruise 
under the Crescent," by Mr. Charles Warren 
Stoddard, who at last breaks a too prolonged 
silence. In philosophy, there will be a four- 
volume work upon "The Metaphysics of Expe- 
rience," by Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson, and 
a translation of Professor Paulsen's " Ethics." 
In theology, two new series, 4t The Churchman's 
Library " and New Testament Handbooks " 
occupy the forefront of the field, to say nothing 
of Dr. Cheyne's great 4t Dictionary of the Bible," 
in four volumes. In music, an announcement 
of marked interest is the series to be called 
44 The Music Lovers' Library," to include vol- 
umes by Messrs. Henderson, Krehbiel, Finck, 
Apthorp, and others. 

The category of literary history and criticism 
offers a bewildering array of promising titles. 
There are volumes of essays by Mr. Austin 
Dobson, Mr. H. W. Mabie, Professor Kuno 
Francke, M. Maeterlinck, Mrs. Meynell, Sidney 
Lanier,and many others. A few titles of unusual 
interest are these : Lamb, Coleridge, and the 
Lloyds," a volume of Lamb's unpublished cor- 
respondence ; M. Rostand's 44 Cyrano de Ber- 
gerac," in two translations ; a " Manual of the 
History of French Literature," by M. Brune- 
tiere ; and " Petrarch, First Modern Scholar 
and Man of Letters," edited by Messrs. J. H. 
Robinson and H. W. Rolfe. The important 
series of 4t Periods of European Literature" will 
be carried rapidly on, no less than seven new 
volumes being announced. 

Turning now to literature in the stricter sense, 
a word may first be said of Mr. Mosher's reprints, 
which will be as interesting as in past years, 
or even more so, since they will include so not- 
able a production as 44 The Germ," the four parts 
reproduced from the rare originals of 1850. 
In new poetry, there is nothing as yet promised 
that is noteworthy, an opinion which hope- 
less Meredithians will probably think heretical, 
since the Odes in Contribution to the Song 
of French History " is marked for early appear- 
ance. Mr. Davidson, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, 
Mrs. Perry, and Miss Guiney, are among 
the verse-writers included in the list. When 
it comes to naming works of fiction, we are 
tempted to throw up our hands in despair. 
A few titles, selected almost at random, are 
44 The Day's Work," by Mr. Rudyard Kipling, 
44 Wild Eelin," by Mr. William Black; Sie-

lanka," by Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz ; " The 
Battle of the Strong," by Mr. Gilbert Parker ; 
" Her Memory," by " Maarten Maartens "; 
" Gloria Mundi," by Mr. Harold Frederic ; 
and " The Castle Inn," by Mr. Stanley Wey- 
man. The announcement that " Alwyn, a Poetic 
Romance, "written many years ago by Mr. Theo- 
dore Watts-Dunton, is at last to be published, 
will probably arouse in a few persons a more 
intense interest than is caused by any other 
book in the long list of works of fiction. 

But we must bring this summary to a close, 
conscious of the fact that entire departments 
have been ignored, and the others most inade- 
quately discussed. We say nothing at all of the 
books in sumptuous garb promised for the holi- 
day season, partly because the announcements 
are far from complete, and partly because 
a mere enumeration of titles is even less 
fitted to do justice to works of this class than 
to others. For such further information as 
has thus far been collected, we must refer our 
readers to the ten or more compactly-printed 
pages to be found later on in this issue, and trust 
that they will find many things to their taste 
beyond what it has been possible to mention 
in the present rapid survey. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, Sept. 3, 1898. 

Since I last wrote to you many things have happened 
here which seem to me to be fraught with large poten- 
tialities of change for the future. In the first place, 
the Committee of the House of Lords, sitting on the 
question of Copyright, has gathered together a mass of 
expert evidence which is likely to alter materially com- 
ing legislation. I should not be at all surprised, if we 
established here a complete bureau for the registration 
and regulation of all matters relating to copyright with 
regard to books, prints, photographs, newspapers, criti- 
cisms, and the rest. It has been suggested that regis- 
tration should be compulsory, and that non-registra- 
tion shall carry with it the penalty of loss of copyright. 
The manager of the " Times," in his evidence, gave 
strong expression to his opinion that copyright in news 
should hold for twenty- four hours; while a music 
publisher complained of damage due to piracies from 
the street piano-organs ! However, all these matters 
are, no doubt, to be made plain in the new Copy- 
right Bill. 

In the second place, we have had launched at us the 
new three-penny illustrated magazine, from the house 
of Messrs. Harmsworth & Co. Following on this, 
came a truly lively controversy between these pub- 
lishers and our largest distributors, Messrs. W. H. 
Smith & Co. The latter complained that the terms 
at which the magazine was supplied did not admit of a 
profit, if sold at threepence. Messrs. Harmsworth re- 
torted that they did, and said a few words which hurt. 



The result, however, bears out Messrs. Smith's conten- 
tion, for the magazine is now published at threepence 
halfpenny. Even the ordinary bookseller found that 
the difference between the cost price and selling price 
barely covered his working expenses. That a three- 
penny magazine, well produced, is appreciated, may be 
gathered from the fact that of the first number of 
Harmsworth's venture, over 800,000 copies were sold. 
But the new " monthly " is not to have the field all to 
itself Messrs. Pearson & Co. announce the "Royal 
Magazine " for October. I understand it is to out- 
shine its rival, and will be a genuine threepenny maga- 
zine; that is to say, it will be retailed at threepence. 
What to us, here, is the startling part of the announce- 
ment, is the information that the issue is to be of one 
million copies. 

In the third place, we have lost one of our oldest 
publishing houses. Messrs. Bentley & Sons have 
vanished in the larger maw of Messrs. Macmillan, 
who have bought up the older house plant, stock, and 
staff. All kinds of speculations have been discussed 
for the cause of this disappearance, but none seem to 
me to have hit upon the right one. Without a doubt, 
the Bentley house disappeared naturally, for the firm 
was never one to change with the changing condition 
of things; and it speaks for the wisdom of its head, in 
that he saw his own limitations, and recognized that the 
times were touching him ungently. Not that the busi- 
ness was not a very excellent one. On the contrary, 
it must have realized large profits, right up to the date 
of the transfer. No, it was simply the fact that it 
lived and had its being in traditions long out of date. 
You, on your side of the water, cannot altogether ap- 
preciate what an old English publishing house is; but 
if you can imagine a man-of-war of the old three- 
decker type of Nelson's day, fighting one of our 
modern ironclads, you will get some idea of what com- 
petition has done for the English publishing business. 
I may say that there are further rumors of other 
amalgamations even more startling, if true, than this 
of the Macmillan -Bentley settlement. 

It all comes to this, that the magazine has almost 
ousted from the attention of the reading public all 
books, other than those which the public acknowledge 
of first importance. I am of opinion, that the future 
of publishing, in this country at any rate, will be 
widely different from what it is now. It seems to me 
that it will be in the hands of a very few larger syndi- 
cates, and the small publisher, like the small trades- 
man, will be compelled to go to the wall. And this 
applies, also, to our second and third-rate writers, 
particularly novelists. So long as the libraries recog- 
nized the three-volume novel, so long was the small 
publisher assured of a definite, if not princely, income; 
and so long did the second-rate writer find a market 
for his wares. But the disappearance of the "three 
decker " has resulted in disastrous effects. Six shillings 
is too much to pay for ephemeral reading, and the 
libraries have not increased their orders proportionately 
to the decrease in price. Moreover, the magazine 
gives all the reading that is wanted, and there are 
enough of them, in all conscience. The small pub- 
lisher must give up publishing, and the second-rate 
author must take to journalism. 

So much for history and speculation thereon. What- 
ever they may not do in the future, it is very certain 
publishers are not idle in the present. Already, our 
journals devoted to literary matters are crowded with 



162 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



" gossip " and announcements. But such news may be 
stale to you; and I will, therefore, confine myself to 
telling yon what you may not have heard. 

Neither Mr. Hall Caine nor Dr. Conan Doyle will 
publish any book this autumn. The former has almost 
finished a story dealing with Rome, but this will not 
be issued until next autumn. You may have beard 
that his next book is to be called "The Drunkard," 
and to be published in monthly shilling parts. Neither 
of these statements is true. Dr. Doyle will have ready 
a volume of short stories, probably early next year. 
Mr. Grant Allen's new novel, to be called "The 
Linnet," and of whieh he thinks very highly himself, 
will be issued this season by Mr. Grant Richards. Mr. 
H. G. Wells, who is much improved in health, has set 
to work finishing a story on which he was engaged 
before he became so ill. Mr. Andrew Lang will issue 
through Messrs. Longmans, a companion volume to 
" Pickle the Spy," to be called " The Companions of 
Pickle." Mr. Kipling's volume of short stories will 
come to us this year through Messrs. Macmillan. 
Messrs. Pearson & Co. will have ready very shortly 
Mr. Max Pemberton's " The Phantom Army," and the 
same firm are on the eve of publishing Mr. Cutcliffe 
Hyne's "The Adventures of Captain Kettle," Mr. 
David Christie Murray's "Despair's Last Journey," 
and new volumes by Bret Harte and Mrs. L. B. Wai- 
ford. For Miss Marie Corelli's new story no pub- 
lisher has, as yet, been found. It will probably not see 
the light this year. 

So much for fiction. In biography, we are prom- 
ised, "Life of Prince Charles Edward," by Andrew 
Lang; Life of William Morris," by J. W. Mackail; 
Reminiscences," by Robert Buchanan ; " Memoirs of 
the Life of Henry Reeve," by J. K. Laugh ton, and Lord 
Ashbourne's account of William Pitt. There are, of 
coarse, others; but I will inform you of these in my next. 

Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole has finished his " History of 
India under the Mogul Dynasty," and Professor Camp- 
bell his " Religion in Greek Literature." I notice that 
Pollock's monograph on " Spinoza " is to be repub- 
lished, as well as a cheaper edition of Lady Burton's 
biography of her husband. 

Of the few art books which are to be published this 
season, the first to mention is Mr. Walter Armstrong's 
"Gainsborough." Then come an illustrated sketch of 
" The Pre-Raphaelite School," and cheaper editions of 
Mr. Malcolm Bell's " Sir Edward Hume-Jones," and 
Mr. Ernest Rhys's book on " Lord Leighton." Both 
these last works will be published by Messrs. George 
Bell & Sons. Mr. Whitman, of the Department of 
Prints, in the British Museum, has finished an excellent 
study of " The Masters of Mezzotint," which Messrs. 
Bell will also issue. It is to be illustrated by about 
sixty examples, reproduced in collotype. 

Of collected editions we are to have in addition to 
the handsome series of the novels of Jane Austen, 
the " Works of the Sisters Bronte*" (Downey &Co.); 
the novels of Henry Fielding (Constable & Co.), and 
a new issue of the complete stories of Charles Dickens 
(Dent & Co.) This last is to be in forty small vol- 
umes, uniform with the same firm's "The Temple 
Scott." The biographical edition of Thackeray is still 
running, as is also the Albany edition of Macaulay. 

An entirely new edition of Shakespeare's works is 
announced by Messrs. Bell. It is to be in small pott size, 
with illustrations by Byam Shaw, Anning Bell, and other 
artists. The text used is that of the Cambridge edition. 



Just at present, it is difficult to give you a good idea 
of what is to come. Publishers seem unprepared with 
information. I may, however, give you more detailed 
information later. At present, it is more than one's head 
is worth to worry busy managers, who have returned from 
holiday-making, only to find themselves plunged in a ver- 
itable sea of arrears of work. 

I am glad to say that Mr. James Garner's version 
of Omar Khayyam's " Rubalyat," is to have an English 
publisher. I think, when yon see the little book in its 
English dress, you will feel that we have done it justice. 
I am even gladder to find that Mr. Nathan Haskell 
Dole's variorum edition of Omar is to be issued here 
also. I can assure yon that the few copies which have 
reached us, have proved of inestimable value. During 
the present stir about FitzGerald and his translation, 
I do not know what three-fourths of our critics and 
writers on the subject would have done without it. 
Mr. Dole's "breviary" edition, when I have shown it 
to any publisher, has turned him green with envy. 

The Author's Society, the Publishers' Association, and 
the Booksellers' Association have had some more con- 
fabulations. They tell us now that they have arrived 
at a modus oivendi. I don't believe it. They none 
of them know what they want, or how to get it, if they 
did. Probably, before they meet again, they will have 
found out some flaw in their arrangements, and the whole 
scheme, so elaborately prepared, will vanish into thin air. 
The three bodies could, if they were permitted, each bite 
the heads off the others; for assuredly, judged by the 
twaddle, they must have maws big enough. How is it 
possible to discuss to advantage if they do not meet on 
a common ground of mutual trust ? I think it is about 
time we took them all with a grain or two of humour. 
They M be much more profitable to us thus taken. 
At any rate, we should have a hearty laugh. Some day, 
there '11 be a terrible rumbns, and authors, publishers, 
and booksellers will then find that they have been beating 
air all this time. As a matter of fact, the right end of the 
stick is still waiting to be seized. TEMPLE SCOTT. 



THE LAST DANCE OF THE LEAVES. 

I. 

Still playing, playing, faithful Pleasure 
Keeps a blithe, beguiling measure; 
The flowers fallen, the thrushes gone, 
Pleasure still is playing on, 
Softly calling back the day 
Glory by glory slipt away. 
The shed leaves, with the rabbits' feet, 
Move to the music; light and fleet, 
They hold once more the happy air, 
With memory hold pale revel there. 

1L 

The wind of Autumn wakes and blows, 
It whistles in the withered close; 
Now it laughs, and now it grieves; 
Weird the measure that it weaves 
For the dances of the yellow leaves. 

The sad grass pale and paler grows, 
Gray Death, from vale to hill he goes; 
Still the wind, it half deceives; 
Weird the measure that it weaves 
For the dances of the dying leaves.

CHINA IN TRANSFORMATION.* 

Readers in search of a comparatively short 
cut to a fair general comprehension of the Far 
Eastern question in its present aspects will find 
in Mr. Archibald R. Colquhoun's " China in 
Transformation " a book well suited to their 
needs. The author has, it must be premised, 
very pronounced and definite views of his own 
on that " question," and he has made up his 
mind thoroughly as to the course England ought 
to pursue in regard to it. The " Russian Bogy " 
haunts Mr. Colquhoun's fancy to a degree that 
makes him something of an alarmist ; and his 
book, when we regard it on its doctrinal or theo- 
retical side, may be fairly described as a tract 
(and a very plausible one it is, if we admit the 
author's premises) in support of the view which 
has gained ground somewhat rapidly of late that 
Russia's impending advance from the north 
toward the cynosural Yang-tsze region must 
be anticipated and countervailed by a corres- 
ponding move on England's part from the south, 
if Asia and eventually the whole world are to be 
saved from the ultimate dominion of the Slav. 
In other words, Mr. Colquhoun is a stalwart 
advocate of the " forward policy," at least so 
far as England's Burman-Chinese frontier is 
concerned. Palmerstonian methods are what 
he sighs for to safeguard Britain's markets in 
the East. How far his views may be modified 
now that the Czar of all the Russias would seem 
to have thrown up the role of Genghiz Khan 
(which Mr. Colquhoun in so many words im- 
putes to him) for that of Anacharsis Clootz, 
it would be interesting to know ; but we venture 
to say he will view the disarmament manifesto 
as only another instance of Muscovite cunning, 
compared with which the slyness of Major Bag- 
stock were candor itself. Russia, he will proba- 
bly argue, comes forward with a proposal to the 
Powers for a scaling down of military budgets 
all round at a time when she is rather " hard up " 
herself, and needs a breathing-space to recruit 
her credit, to push her strategical railways to 
completion, and to settle and strengthen her- 
self in the territory she has already wrested 
from China. Russia, he may point out, is ex- 
plicitly anxious that everybody should stop 
building warships for a while, just after her 
great rival has out- trumped her by voting thirty

millions for naval purposes. In fine, as it will 
be easy for him to show, a season of assured 
peace will redound just now especially to Rus- 
sia's advantage ; therefore she proffers the olive 
branch. But Mr. Colquhoun will undoubtedly 
dread the Russians, et dona ferentes ; and 
while he may possibly (as we trust he will) 
recognize the personal sincerity of the Czar in 
proposing to relieve the peoples of the burdens 
of militarism, he will nevertheless see behind 
that humane and benignant yet pathetically 
isolated figure the Ignatieffs, Pavloffs, Mura- 
vieffs the true exponents of those fundamen- 
tally fixed quantities, Russian statesmanship 
and ambition. As he says : 

"Russian ambition is a permanent plant, with its 
roots struck in the sentiments of over one hundred 
millions of people. It requires no originality in states- 
manship, but proceeds like a cosmic movement, by its 
own laws working automatically, the particular men 
who seem from time to time to be guiding it being but 
the accidents of the movement. . . To parley with such 
a force is like parleying with the tidal wave. Only a sea- 
wall of solid construction can set bounds to its inflow." 

It is time now to say that our author's inten- 
sity of conviction as to what ought to be done 
in the East does not materially affect his clear 
and concise picture of what is. He naturally 
tends to dwell most on and perhaps slightly 
overcolor such facts as make for his own views ; 
but his book is a fair one in the main, presenting 
just such an account of the actual China as will 
interest the general reader, and be helpful to 
men of business, politicians, and travellers. 
Mr. Colquhoun brings to his task exceptional 
qualifications for it. Many years of service in 
Burma, first as an engineer, and later as Deputy- 
Commissioner ; repeated visits to Siam, in an 
official as well as a private capacity ; prolonged 
stays in China as explorer, special correspond- 
ent of the " Times," and, recently, in connec- 
tion with important negotiations concerning 
railway questions such experiences certainly 
warrant his claim to speak with some authority. 

The volume opens with two preparative chap- 
ters, the first one setting forth what is necessary 
for the reader to know of the geography of China 
of to-day, the second outlining the history of 
China's foreign relations. Thence Mr. Colqu- 
houn passes on to consider in separate chapters 
the Economic Question, the Question of Com- 
munications, England's Objective in China, 
Commercial Development, Diplomatic Inter- 
course, the Native Press, the Chinese People, 
Chinese Democracy, the Political Question, etc. 

It is important for the general reader of 
Mr. Colquhoun's book to grasp at the outset 



164 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



the perhaps imperfectly realized fact that the 
once colossal Chinese Empire, which not long 
ago covered an area of some four and a half 
million square miles, is now virtually shrunk 
to the eighteen provinces of China Proper 
a populous region measuring about one and 
a half million square miles, and being thus 
about half the size of Europe, or seven times 
that of France. The vast tracts lying outside 
this region are still almost terrce incognita, and 
are (except Manchuria) beyond the radius of 
profitable trade for England though still of 
strategical importance. Tibet, for instance, 
will eventually be occupied by the Russians 
unless England takes steps betimes to prevent 
it. Manchuria is already practically Russian ; 
Mongolia, Hi, and Kashgaria are the Czar's 
whenever it pleases him to occupy them ; Corea 
no longer belongs to China, and her ultimate fate 
still hangs in the balance. When we discuss 
China of to-day, then, we mean the eighteen 
provinces of China Proper which, speaking 
roughly, is bounded on the east by the Yellow 
and China seas, reaching from Corea to the 
Tongking Gulf ; on the west by Kokonor and 
Tibet ; on the south by Tongking and the Shan 
States ; on the north by Mongolia and Russia. 
Mr. Colquhoun reckons the inhabitants of this 
country at 350,000,000, a population by no 
means excessive, being only twelve times that 
of England, while the area which subsists it 
is thirty times greater. It is in its distribution, 
then, rather than its numbers, that the popula- 
tion of China is remarkable, the pressure on the 
eastern seaboard and the great water-ways being 
unparalleled elsewhere, while away from these 
centres it decreases rapidly. About half the 
area of the eighteen provinces, an acreage 
of 400,000,000, is good cultivable land. Owing 
mainly to the infiltration from Turkestan, the 
Mohammedan element in the population is large, 
even Peking containing some twenty thousand 
Mohammedan families. Altogether the Moslem 
population numbers about thirty millions ; and 
this class, from its numbers and character, must 
be accounted an important factor as regards the 
future of China. Mr. Colqnhoun observes 
that " while Christianity, an exotic, seems to be 
waning in China, the change of religion gives 
to the Chinese convert of Islam the qualities he 
lacks namely, independence, courage, and 
devotion." 

Passing to the economic question, the author 
agrees with Richthofen that " the slumbering 
factors of an immense industrial production 
all exist in China." The soil is eminently rich 



in the raw material of wealth ; while the do- 
cile, frugal, incredibly industrious, and supple- 
fingered Chinaman meets in the highest degree 
the ideal of an intelligent human machine. 
What is lacking to transform Cathay into a 
vast hive of the most multifarious industry is 
primarily the magic impulse of improved com- 
munications. Penetrate to the heart of China 
by rail and water; force the products of the 
west into the marts of the interior, so that the 
Chinaman may see, and covet, and be impelled 
to work and save in order that he may buy, 
and the era of a new and awakened China is 
begun. 

In his interesting chapter on Chinese De- 
mocracy the author touches on the question of 
the causes of the nation's longevity. Why is 
China an apparent exception to the law that 
nations, like individuals, must run their allot- 
ted cycle of youth, maturity, and decay ? Mr. 
Colquhoun does not venture on a full explana- 
tion of this national vitality that has vanquished 
all conquerors, but he assigns as a contribu- 
tory cause of it "the faculty of local self- 
government which runs in the Chinese blood." 
The Chinese polity is, like our own, broadly 
and perhaps roughly speaking, a dual one; but 
the dualism is with them, in fact if not in 
theory, far more pronounced than with us. 
The Imperial government plays a small part 
in the domestic affairs of China at large. The 
average Chinaman knows little of it and cares 
little about it. He is conscious of it mainly 
when it annoys him or fleeces him fiscally; but 
he is conversant with his local affairs and 
knows how to manage them. He is mildly 
interested in the politics of his province, and 
an active participant in those of his village. 
Thus, amid all their dynastic convulsions the 
people of China have remained unchanged, 
mainly because they are, in spite of their in- 
stinct of self-government, a non-political peo- 
ple, indifferent to affairs of state, and intent 
on their home concerns and their own business. 

Theoretically, England, in shaping her course 
in China, has her choice of these alternatives : 
either the " open door " policy, which means the 
upholding by her at all hazards of the integrity 
of the Chinese Empire against the aggressions 
of the protectionist powers ; or the " spheres of 
influence " policy, which means that she must 
tacitly acquiesce in the looming partition of 
China into " spheres of influence " and " Hin- 
terlands," by joining in the race herself and 
seeing to it betimes that her own u sphere " 
shall be as large and as rich as possible, and also

that it shall be so situated as to be of strategical 
advantage to her Indian Empire. But, practi- 
cally, of these alternatives the "open door" 
policy now seems to be illusory. England can- 
not single-handed hold China open to the trade 
of the world and, indeed, the door of Man- 
churia has already been shut " with a slam," 
as someone indignantly says in reply to Lord 
Salisbury. Mr. Colquhoun does not distinctly 
state that the " open door " theory must be aban- 
doned ; but the drift of his argument seems to 
be that if England cannot keep open the whole, 
she must strive to keep open as much as she can ; 
and that her paramountcy in the rich and popu- 
lous regions watered by the Yangtsze-Kiang is 
absolutely essential to the maintenance of her 
Eastern interests. This end, which is a matter 
of life and death for England, can only be 
attained by an effective occupation of the Upper 
Yangtsze, and by developing communications, 
along that main artery, and by the West River, 
from Hongkong, and by railway connection 
between Upper Burma, and through that pro- 
vince between India and central China. The 
Burman Irawaddy may be thus joined by rail 
with the navigable headwaters of the splendid 
Yangtsze, and continuity of British territory and 
influence be established from Cape Comorin 
through Hindostan, Burma, and south-western 
China, up to the future Russian line. There will 
be established the " solid barrier " to Russia's 
advance Indiawards through China Proper. Nor 
will the " resolute forward policy " here outlined 
redound, Mr. Colquhoun urges, to England's 
advantage alone. It is high time, he thinks, 
and rightly, that the United States, Germany, 
and Australasia set themselves diligently to 
study these Far Eastern movements. 

Mr. Colquhoun does not suggest directly 
how the tremendous railway and kindred opera- 
tions he advocates are to be financed; but we 
may assume that he means that the British 
government must take the initiative, and thus 
embark upon the, for it, novel function of as 
Lord Salisbury recently expressed it " trac- 
ing out plans for railways in foreign countries, 
constructing railways in all directions, finding 
capital and capitalists, and so forth." Mr. 
Colquhoun's book tells the reader concisely 
what is most necessary to be known of the 
present situation in China, and it tells him ex- 
plicitly how the best informed of the "for- 
ward" school would like to deal with it 
indeed we may say, now that Mr. Curzon has 
gone out to India as viceroy, how it is not 
unlikely to be dealt wifh. E. G. J. 



A NEW BOOK ON AN OL.D THEME.* 

There are two ways of writing history, as 
there are two ways of telling a story. The 
first way is for the historian to write what he 
has to say just as though it had never been 
written before. It may, indeed, have been 
written before ; but if so he does not know the 
fact, or at least does not appear to know it. 
His air is that of a man who is making an 
important communication that is wholly new 
and original to his readers. The other way 
assumes that the history has been actually writ- 
ten but not correctly written, that the reader is 
familiar with this earlier form and has been 
influenced by it, and that it is the business of 
the writer not merely to tell him the truth, but 
so to tell it as to displace the false history that 
is in the reader's mind. The writer is thor- 
oughly conscious of the fact that he is not 
making a new or original contribution to the 
knowledge of his readers ; on the other hand, 
he is conscious of the contrary at every step. 
Again, he may show this consciousness in two 
different ways. He may go on with his narra- 
tive without formal criticism of the history that 
he is all the time seeking to destroy, but still 
keep this history all the time in mind ; or he may 
engage in such criticism, and so become a con- 
troversialist. These are all legitimate methods 
of writing history under certain conditions, and 
we have no right, prima facie, to find fault 
with a writer because he uses any one, or 
indeed all, of them. He must adapt his method 
to his work. These two ways of writing his- 
tory may be called the narrative method and 
the critical method. 

Mr. Alexander Brown's " First Republic in 
America " falls under the controversial form of 
the critical method. He all the time has an 
antagonist in mind. We do not say that he 
holds a brief, but we do say that he writes to 
maintain a thesis, or rather two theses, a major 
and a minor. The major thesis touches the 
character of the government of Virginia pre- 
vious to the quo warranto of 1624 ; the minor 
affects the character and the services in Vir- 
ginia of Captain John Smith. The first thesis 
is suggested by the title of the book : Virginia 
was the first republic in America, or, more 
definitely, the London Company was a semi- 
nary, not of " sedition," as the Spanish minis-

ter said, but of popular rights. In the author's 
own words : The London Company of 
1609-24 . . . had been a cradle of civil and 
religious liberty ; in it were fostered the ideas 
which were the germ of the Commonwealth of 
England and the genesis of the United States." 
As respects John Smith, the contention is 
not that the Pocohontas tale is a myth ; on this 
point little is said but that Smith was a fac- 
tious, vainglorious adventurer, the apologist 
and eulogist of James I., and corrupter of the 
very sources of our national history. Mr. Brown 
does not doubt that Smith was a brave man, 
or deny that he is deserving of some praise for 
gome things which he did in Virginia ; but 

"He was not a hero nor a saint; he was not the 
founder of Virginia, nor the father of New England. 
Inspired by his controlling trait, vanity, he provided for 
his present and future fame by catering to the ideas of 
the king; by furnishing his own eulogy in the various 
tracts and books published by himself, and in the notes, 
etc., supplied by him to others; and by leaving (in his 
will) 20 (more than twice as much as his contribution 
9 to Virginia), to be disbursed in his own funeral 
expenses. Ue would really have been more deserving 
of our respect if he had been guiltless of doing some of 
these things; yet he has been regarded as ' the only man 
in Virginia ' because he was the only man who did these 
things. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.' Very many 
more modest and more worthy men lie unhonored and 
unknown beneath the sacred soil of the Old Dominion. 
. . . Our first history, founded on the vanity of King 
James and Captain John Smith, is a shame, and we can- 
not mend the matter by canonizing its author, or by 
defending its errors. We must correct its wrongs and 
render justice to our real founders." 

This is Mr. Brown's task : he undertakes to 
write our early history as it should be written, 
and so to write it as to displace the false his- 
tory that has so long found acceptance. Merely 
to pronounce upon the important questions that 
he raises, would be stale and unprofitable ; and 
to traverse the ground with him, would take us 
too far afield. So we must be content with 
offering some remarks on two or three of the 
more interesting features of the book. 

As to John Smith, it is the same with him 
dead that it was with him living : he still sets 
men by the ears. He was a prisoner in irons 
when he reached Virginia, was engaged in 
quarrels nearly all the time that he was there, 
and while at the head of the government insisted 
on governing alone. Smith may have been 
right in all these transactions, and everybody 
else wrong ; but it must be said of this hypoth- 
esis, as of so much else in his career, possi- 
ble but not probable. We see no prospect of 
men ever agreeing about Smith. Mr. John 
Fiske, for example, differs from Mr. Alexander 



Brown respecting him toto celo. Smith's writ- 
ings remind Mr. Fiske of General Grant's 
" Memoirs " by their stamp of honesty upon 
every page, and he considers him one of the 
noblest and most lovable characters in Ameri- 
can history. 

Mr. Brown's theory of Smith is really a part 
of his theory of Virginia and the London Com- 
pany. Virginia was the first republic in Amer- 
ica, and if it has not so appeared to men it is 
because Smith falsified the early history. But 
how could he do this ? The great promoters 
of the colony were men of grand ideas and 
noble spirit ; they sought, while keeping the 
institutions of Virginia in conformity with the 
laws of England, to advance civil and religious 
liberty in the plantation, and they were finally 
balked, in so far as they were balked, by the 
mean, narrow, and oppressive policy of James I. 
No one familiar with the facts is likely to ques- 
tion this view of the matter. In particular, no 
one who reads Mr. Brown's pages is likely to 
question the high character and noble ideals of 
Sir Edwin Sandys. The facts, too, seem to 
show that Smith was ranged on the King's side 
rather than the founders' side. The great ques- 
tion is simply whether the government under 
the Company was so bad, and the history of the 
colony so disastrous, that the King was justified 
in forcing Virginia, by means of the quo war- 
ranto, out of their hands. Mr. Brown's theory 
is that Smith and the King were virtually in 
collusion ; that his accounts of things in Vir- 
ginia forwarded the royal purpose ; while the 
destruction of one part of the Company's record 
and the long concealment of another part left 
Smith's accounts mainly unchallenged. On this 
point we are bound to think the author has been 
somewhat carried away by his enthusiasm for 
the Company and his detestation of Smith. 

Some of the most interesting passages in the 
volume relate to the origin and propagation of 
the ideas that Sandys and his associates sought 
to plant in Virginia. Mr. Brown is a Church- 
man, but over and over again he points to Gen- 
eva as theybns et origo of the republican move- 
ment. Still Mr. Brown appears anxious that 
the Church of England shall have due meed 
of praise for the good work done in America. 

" Although civil and religious liberty was planted in 
America under the inspiration of the liberal ideas then 
budding in England, which were largely derived from 
an admiration impressed on the minds of English stu- 
dents for the form of government established for Geneva 
by Calvin and the Reformers, the accomplishment of 
these ' popular ' ideas was due to the popular charters 
of the Virginia Company of London drafted by Sir

Edwin Sandys, ' a Church of England man ' and a son 
of one of the heads of that Church. For it was under 
these charters that the seed was planted both in South 
and in North Virginia. Sufficient honor rightly belongs 
to the Pilgrim Fathers to make it unnecessary to take 
for them any honor which rightly belongs to others; 
and, after giving all due credit to others, it must be 
confessed that civil and religious liberty in the new 
world owe their first debt to broadminded Churchmen, 
and to the liberality of the Church of England, which 
was also the great factor in holding America for the 
Anglo-Saxon against the Church of Rome." 

Here is matter for a dissertation, but we have 
space only for the reflection that in distributing 
the honors of the period of 1606-1624, it is 
easy to make quite too much of such words as 
" pilgrim," " puritan," and " churchman." 
Puritanism was not separated from Anglican- 
ism by a flash of lightning, while there was 
sometimes little difference between the Pilgrim 
and the Churchman except the external fact 
that one was out of and the other in the Estab- 
lishment. 

We have barely space left to speak of the 
valuable service that Mr. Brown rendered his- 
torical scholarship by his " Genesis of the 
United States." The present work is an out- 
growth of that one. The earlier work was a 
compilation of historical documents, with pref- 
ace, introduction, and annotation ; the later one 
purports to be history itself. It is not an easy 
book to read. Mr. Brown's style tends to heavi- 
ness, while the great number of quotations that 
he introduces, sometimes whole documents, re- 
inforces the tendency. He has prepared a val- 
uable book for his purpose, the more valuable 
because it is heavy ; but his most ardent ad- 
mirer need not hesitate to admit that he will 
hold his place in literature as a purveyor of 
historical material rather than as an historian. 
His patience in search of documents seems to 
be tireless, and his judgment as to their value 
is commonly sound ; but the historian's art he 

has not B. A. HINSDALE. 



AN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF MORALS.* 

To naturalistic and evolutionary theories of 
morals, which have been so current of late 
years, Mr. Alexander Sutherland makes a 
painstaking and elaborate contribution in " The 
Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct." 
Mr. Sutherland founds himself upon Adam 
Smith's doctrine of sympathy as the essence of 

* THE ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE MORAL INSTINCT. By 
Alexander Sutherland, M. A. In two volumes. New York : 
Longmans, Qreen, & Co. 



morality, and especially upon Darwin's evolu- 
tionary scheme as sketched in his " Descent of 
Man." The author describes " full half " of 
his book as being " a detailed expansion of the 
fourth and fifth chapters of the ' Descent of 
Man.' " Mr. Sutherland maintains that the 
moral instinct originates and grows with sym- 
pathy, and that sympathy is implied in the pa- 
rental care which springs up quite early in the 
evolution of life as a more advantageous method 
than careless fertility. He shows clearly how 
from fish, which without parental care require 
a million eggs a year to keep up the species, 
the number of offspring is steadily diminished 
in succeeding types till in apes and man one in 
two years is the average. 

" The connection between this decline in the numbers 
of offspring and the general rise of intelligence is very 
clear, when we reflect that in the stupendous engulf- 
ment of life which the world's daily history presents, 
only the development of remarkable faculties could save 
a race from destruction if a single young one each year 
from each female was its sole reliance. And there is 
no sort of progress more essential in this regard than 
that advance of parental care which serves to carry the 
feeble young ones over their initial dangers." 

A large part of the first volume is taken up 
with a careful and interesting study of the 
progress of parental care in fishes, amphibians, 
reptiles, birds, mammals, and mankind ; and a 
like study is made of conjugal and general so- 
cial sympathy. Both conjugal and social sym- 
pathy awaken and are developed in connection 
with parental sympathy, and perform the great- 
est service in the advancement of the species. 

u The quality of sympathy whose origin was so hum- 
ble that in fish and reptile its function was merely to 
facilitate the hatching of the better type in a world of 
ceaseless struggle and destruction, has risen by perfect 
continuity to form the basis of the most beautiful of all 
things that earth contains: a moral nature swayed by 
impulses of pure and tender sympathy." 

The second volume discusses the four forms 
of morality to which sympathy gives rise. First 
of all, primitive simple sympathy is itself a 
natural morality. 

" The man who never fails of kindliness in his rela- 
tions as father, husband, brother, friend, or citizen, is a 
good man. There are three higher stages he may yet 
attain. There is the morality of duty, the morality of 
self-respect, and there is the morality which springs 
from an ideal of the beauty of goodness. But these by 
themselves are weak and pretentious things when they 
want their natural basis, a true and warm-hearted sym- 
pathy. Sympathy, or, as it is there called, love, is the 
basis of morality; indeed, is morality in the religions of 
Jesus and Buddha." 

The feeling of duty Mr. Sutherland derives 
from the social pressure on the individual of 
the average sympathy of the race. Men every-

where are restrained and impelled by the stand- 
ard of their community and nation. 

"Morality assumes a very noble aspect when, to 
sympathy and a cheerful compliance with duty whose 
auction is external, there is added a complete surrender 
to that sense of self-respect which is only duty with an 
internal sanction. . . . Morality appears in all its noblest 
guise, when upon these three there is superimposed an 
u-sthetic glow; when the sense of right conduct awakens 
all the enthusiasm that kindles within us at the aspect 
of aught that is beautiful." 

Later in his work, Mr. Sutherland takes up 
the subjects of responsibility, right and wrong, 
and the psychology of sympathy. In ignorance 
of the James-Lange theory, he elaborates for 
himself a thoroughgoing physiological theory of 
emotion, that all emotions are due to " changes 
of vascular tone." So " maternal affection is 
connected fundamentally with a change of vas- 
cular tone which causes the yearning tender- 
ness experienced by the mother at sight of her 
babe." The whole process is physiological from 
the very beginning. 

" But suppose that in the slow succession of monot- 
onous ages a slight advance in nerve organization should 
happen to synchronize with a small tendency on the 
part of parents to guard their eggs or their offspring, 
the higher type might, and probably would, thereby 
escape the effects of its prolonged immaturity. And if 
so, it is very plain that when, under this sheltering con- 
dition, it did in fact attain its adult state, then would 
its quicker sense, its subtler brain, its more deftly co- 
ordinated powers, give it ascendancy over all its fellows." 

The main criticism we have to offer on this 
book is a psychological one. The author takes 
too readily for granted that parental care always 
implies sympathy, and he nowhere closely de- 
fines and analyzes sympathy. He describes sym- 
pathy as " only a general term we give to that 
subtle susceptibility of nerve which renders one 
individual ready to catch the contagion of the 
emotions of another individual." But surely the 
mere catching of an emotion from another does 
not of itself constitute sympathy. For instance, 
panic is contagious fear, but sympathy is usually 
absent. Sympathy is not a mere partaking of 
the emotions of others, but is a particular kind 
of an emotion at the emotion or experience of 
the others, a feeling of pity and a desire to aid. 
Sympathy is, then, a rather advanced and com- 
plex emotion, and so unlikely to be found in 
animals unless in slight measure in highest 
types. Offspring are primarily a part of one's 
self, or are one's possession, the primitive prop- 
erty, and thus parental care in earlier stages 
may imply only the simple self-conservative 
emotions, like anger and fear. The male stickle- 
back shows great activity in protecting his 
young, great rage against their enemies, not 



necessarily out of sympathy for the young, but 
because they are of him and his. He shows 
the same spirit as when he defends his captured 
food against invaders. Of course only thor- 
ough scientific psychological investigation can 
decide the matter, but the presumption is 
against sympathy. Parental care even in man- 
kind is largely based on selfish emotion. Thus, 
strike a child and the father's anger blazes 
against you for injuring his child ; the pure 
sympathy comes in if a stranger standing by 
interferes on the child's behalf. 

On the whole, while we think this work a con- 
siderable contribution to the biology of the sub- 
ject, in its psychology it has effected but little. 
Just what sympathy is, and where it begins in 
animal life, and how it progresses, cannot be 
solved in any off-hand manner, but only by par- 
ticular scientific psychological observations and 
experimentation which have yet to be made. In 
psychology the author shows little aptitude, 
training, or information. While this book dis- 
plays considerable merit and ability, it exploits 
a system too dogmatically without consideration 
of difficulties to be thoroughly convincing ; and 
its vast range makes it in some respects, despite 
the author's industry, rather superficial and 
cursory. HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



A SCHOLARS' HISTORY OF GREECE.*

English version of Holm's History of Greece 
has finally been issued, and this important work 
is now as a whole in the hands of English and 
American readers for examination and use. 
That it will take high and permanent place 
as an authority is not to be questioned ; though 
this has for some years been true of the Ger- 
man original, which scholars have of course 
consulted. But it is doubtful whether Holm's 
history will be widely read or intelligently esti- 
mated by many outside of professional students. 
In no sense can it be expected to be " popular "; 
the narrative lacks charm, and the inevitable 
condensation in treatment makes hard reading 
in these days of episodical surveys, " stories of 
the nations," and war sketches. Holm has 
something of the caustic humor and homely 
telling phraseology of Mommsen ; but his book 
will remain a brilliant piece of laboratory work 
rather than literature.

already been noticed at some length in these 
columns ; the fourth, now before us, must be 
briefly considered. Its range is " the Graeco- 
Macedonian age, the period of the Kings and 
the Leagues, from the death of Alexander 
(B. C. 323) to the incorporation of the last 
Macedonian monarchy in the Roman empire," 
which took place in the year B. C. 30. This 
pushes far past the limit (Alexander's death) 
set by Grote, and even beyond the usual 
146 B. C., the terminus of most histories of 
Greece. Holm's reasons for this extension of 
dates are tersely stated in the preface : 

" My decision not to end with the year 146, as I orig- 
inally intended, will be justified by the narrative. It is 
precisely the larger compass, both in point of time and 
space, thus given to my history which has enabled me, 
as I believe, to approximate more closely to an import- 
ant result, viz., a proper estimate of the character of 
the Greek world in this period and in particular of the 
civic life of the independent cities. The relations be- 
tween Rome and the Greeks also seemed to me not to 
have been always correctly appreciated . . . finally, I 
may point out that the self-government of the Greeks 
under the supremacy of the Kings and the Romans, on 
which I have laid stress, is a historical fact of some 
importance; and that consequently the study of this 
section of ancient history may be more profitable than 
some authorities of our day seem to think." 

It is precisely the novelty of these varied 
chapters on the civilization of the kingdoms set 
going by the Diadochi that will compensate the 
thoughtful student for the apparently scattered 
effect of the volume as a whole. When a world- 
empire like that of Alexander breaks to pieces, 
the task of its historian, hitherto simple, be- 
comes distracting ; and a dozen scholars may 
more profitably produce monographs than any 
one of them may attempt to cover the ground. 
Holm has coordinated, digested, and sometimes 
opposed the conclusions of his predecessors ; he 
has read to confute, in many instances ; but his 
views will command the respect, if not the ac- 
ceptance, of all scholars. At any rate, here is 
a clear and well-balanced summing-up of one of 
the most perplexing portions of ancient history. 

The fourth volume continues the excellent 
features of the other three ; and adds the long- 
awaited index, which might be somewhat more 
minute. We learn, also, the name of the trans- 
lator : it is Frederick Clarke, formerly Tay- 
lorian scholar in the University of Oxford. 
The full and accurate lists of authorities ap- 
pended to each chapter are as valuable as ever ; 
and the references to revisions of great stand- 
ard works, such as the Pauly-Wissowa Real- 
encyclop'ddie, are quite up to date. We may 
note the frequent mention of an American 



scholar, Professor Sterrett of Amherst as an ac- 
cepted guide in the archaeology of Asia Minor. 
The translation seems more carefully done 
than in the preceding volumes : the English 
style is well considered ; and there are very few 
slips in grammar or proof-reading to offend the 
eye. " Memmon " (p. 94) for Memnon, the 
omission of the historian Freeman's first initial 
(p. 269), " North America " (p. 270) for the 
United States, and an inexcusable " was de- 
feated like Dionysius had been at Gela," nearly 
complete the tale ; and there are a few minor 
inconsistencies in spelling. On the whole, 
Holm's History of Greece will be immensely 
prized by the world of scholars for whom it was 
written. JOSIAH RENICK SMITH;. 



PAPERS FROM THE 
WORLD'S FAIR FOLK-I^ORE CONGRESS.* 

Long delayed, but none the less welcome, 
is the Report of the International Folk-Lore 
Congress held in Chicago in 1893 one of the 
most successful of the long series of Congresses 
held at the time of the Exposition. The papers 
read were of more than usual popular as well 
as scientific interest. This success was in large 
part due to the energy and able management of 
Lieut. F. S. Bassett, who was chief interpreter 
and translator of the Exposition and at the 
same time chairman of the Folk-Lore Con- 
gress. Mr. Bassett died in October of 1893. 
Very fittingly, a notice of his life and work 
appears in this volume. 

Mythical and traditional beliefs, native 
songs, peculiar customs and institutions which 
have survived from the past that is, folk- 
lore are to be found in every land. As wide 
in range as the subject itself were the papers 
read at the Congress and now published in the 
first volume of the archives of the Association. 
Fifty-six papers were presented by students of 
folk-lore from all parts of the world. Some of 
them, as now printed, are very brief, or are 
merely collections of folk-tales or accounts of 
popular practices ; while others are careful 
interpretations and studies of myths and tales. 

Detailed reference to them all is of course 
impossible. One or two which seem of especial 
interest and importance may be noticed. Mr. 
David MacRitchie, in a paper of fourteen

[Sept. 16, 



pages, discusses " The Northern Trolls." Scan- 
dinavia is a country rich in mythical lore. These 
trolls, or dwarfs, have been looked upon in re- 
cent times as mythical beings existing only in 
the stories of the people. There seems, how- 
ever, good reason to believe that there did live 
in Northern Europe at one time a people small 
in stature, dwarfs or pigmies, smaller than the 
Lapps and occupying the country before them. 
Scandinavian traditions describe these dwarfs 
in considerable detail. Mr. MacRitchie, fol- 
lowing Professor Nilsson, draws an interesting 
parallel between these people and the Lapps 
a parallel so striking that there seems little dif- 
ficulty in identifying them, at least in part, and 
so making the dwarfs a real people. Mr. Mac- 
Ritchie goes further, and shows that the Norse- 
men for several centuries " applied the three 
terms, Lapp, troll, and pigmy, to one people on 
the western shores of the Atlantic." Here in 
America, then, it appears a small people was 
living when the Norsemen landed. They may 
have been the Eskimo ; or, since there are tra- 
ditions among the Eskimo, as among the Lapps, 
of a still smaller folk who lived in caves under 
ground, it may be that the Eskimo were pre- 
ceded on the American coast by a race of 
dwarfs. The trolls of Northern Europe and 
the dwarfs of America, Mr. MacRitchie sug- 
gests, were the ancestors of the Ainu of Eastern 
Asia. Several characters, notably the shaggy 
skins, point to a connection between them. 
While this does not seem to be proved, few will 
hesitate to accept the pigmies of Scandinavia 
as a reality, and no one will fail to see the value 
in ethnological study of attention to mythical 
and traditional lore. As Mr. W. E. Griffis 
points out in his discussion of the folk-lore of 
Japan, "The folk-lore is often a distorted 
shadow of real history, while also it is true that 
the events of prehistoric times are brought 
before us by means of the folk-tales handed 
down to us from ages older than writing in 
Japan." 

Somewhat incidentally, one gains from these 
papers a considerable knowledge of various 
peoples, aside from their folk-lore. In Western 
Russia, on the shores of the Baltic, live the 
Lithuano-Latavian people, numbering a little 
less than five millions. They are very interest- 
ing in themselves, and especially in that it has 
been claimed for them, with much reason, that 
they are the nearest representatives, in their 
speech, of the original Aryans. The Latavian 
branch of this once important people, better 
known as Lettonian or Lettish, numbers to-day 



about a million and a half. A lover of the 
Latavians Dr. Henry Wissendorff has 
written a brief sketch of them, their history, 
industry, intelligence, and progress. As might 
be expected in a people as old as they, there is 
to be found among them an abundance of tales, 
traditions, and peculiar customs, which, when 
carefully studied, are certain to yield much of 
value to European history and ethnology. 

From the two papers discussed, some idea 
will be gained of the contents of this volume. 
While the papers are valuable in themselves, 
a still greater value it is believed will be found 
in the lines of study indicated and in the incen- 
tive to further investigation which they will 
prove. The book contains illustrations of ob- 
jects of ethnologic interest, and portraits of 
some members of the Congress whose papers 
are here published. MERTON L. MILLER. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

The fame of Herr Sudermann has been fairly 
well bruited abroad during the past few years, but 
we have come to think of him as essentially a dra- 
matist, hearing little of the remarkable novels to 
which his first reputation in his own country was 
due. It is true that we had an English version of 
" Fran Sorge " several years ago, but the far more 
powerful novel of " Die Katzensteg " has remained 
untranslated until now, when Miss Beatrice Mar- 
shall has done the work so acceptably as to deserve 
the warmest gratitude. " Regina ; or, The Sins of 
the Fathers," the novel is now entitled, although the 
expression, " The Cat's Bridge " occurs frequently

enough in the narrative to have warranted its use 
upon the title-page. It is a powerful work of fiction, 
imbued with the Nietzschean scorn of conventional 
morality that sweeps like a wind-storm through so 
much of recent German literature. Stagnant waters 
need to be stirred at times, in literature as else- 
where, but whether the philosophy of the Ueber- 
mensch and the Umwerthung oiler Werthe is likely 
to stir them to healing effect is at least doubtful. 
Its sweep has a bracing effect, at any rate, and its 
strength is undeniable, whether associated with poe- 
try, as in " Die Versunkene Glocke," or relying 
upon no such ally, as in the uncompromising and 
almost brutal novel now under consideration. The 
period is that of the War of Liberation, but the 
problem is rather of the present era than of the year 
that witnessed the last gigantic struggle against the 
Corsican brigand. The hero is an East Prussian 
Junker who has sought to wipe out, by fighting for 
the Fatherland, the stain left upon his name by the 
treachery of his father. He finds all society leagued 
against him, in spite of his own heroic deeds, and 
is thrown back upon the sole companionship of the 
woman who had been his father's associate in more 
kinds of sinful conduct than one. Abhorring her at 
first, he comes in time to tolerate, recognizing that 
she, at least, had sinned through ignorance, and 
believing a dangerous sophistry that she had 
remained pure in soul. Finally, when she has died 
to save his life, his volte-face is completed, and one 
cannot easily forget the scene in which he buries 
her with his own hands, and sets a broken statue of 
Diana above her grave as a tombstone. The pastor 
appears and offers Christian burial for the deceased. 
" Many thanks, your reverence, but I have already 
buried her with Pagan rites." This is the note of 
final revolt, and clearly what the author would have 
us take as the essential moral of the whole action. 
It is an ideal that will never win permanent accept- 
ance, but its influence will be hard to combat, and 
the strife will be sharp. 

Dr. Ebers, in the romance completed shortly be- 
fore his death, has left the mediaeval Germans of 
Nuremberg and returned to the Greeks in Egypt. 
The hero of "Arachne" is the sculptor Hermon 
whose descendants made Pergamon famous in the 
history of art, and wrought the gigantic works that 
are the wonder of the Berlin museum. All this, 
however, is merely suggested at the close of the 
romance, just as the career of Erasmus is suggested 
at the close of " The Cloister and the Hearth." The 
substance of " Arachne " is a tale of jealous passion, 
ending in a tragedy for the heroine, and all but wreck- 
ing the life of the hero. It is stiff and wooden in con- 
ception, although rather less so than the later works 
of this writer have been wont to be, and the interest, 
both romantic and archaeological, is considerable. 

Readers of " The Keds of the Midi," as trans- 
lated from the Provencal of M. Felix Gras by Mrs. 
Janvier, will welcome a continuation of the narrative 
done into English by the same skilful hands. The 
vividly picturesque story of the march to Paris 



of the famous Marseillaise batallion offers one of 
the most truthful pictures in romantic fiction of the 
stirring scenes of the early revolutionary days, when 
mankind seemed to have recovered a long lost birth- 
right, and when the deepest and most generous 
instincts of the human soul were endowed with 
a new life. Those days of fine enthusiasm were, 
as history sadly relates, followed by days so dark that 
it seemed for a time as if the Revolution had set back 
the hand upon the dial of human progress instead of 
moving it forward, and in " The Terror " M. Gras 
depicts for us the horrors of the Year One of the 
Republic. Pascalet does not figure in this sequel, 
but the winsome Comtessine Adeline whom he loved, 
and who remained through all vicissitudes true to his 
memory, is ever present as the centre of interest, and 
her pursuit by, and final escape from, the scoundrels 
who were seeking her life forms the substance of the 
tale. It is essentially an intimate and even homely 
view of the Terror that we get from these pages, not 
the unmixed sensationalism of most works of the sort, 
although lurid scenes are not lacking, and although 
blood flows profusely upon many occasions. But 
peace follows the storm at last, and sunset light falls 
upon the closing scenes in Avignon. 

There is no excuse for such a publication as " The 
Red Lily." It pretends to be a translation of " Le 
Lys Rouge," by M. Anatole France, and, as trans- 
lations go, it is no worse or more reckless than hun- 
dreds of others. But it is almost sacrilege to treat 
M. France in this brutal fashion, and the book 
clearly appeals to the sensuality rather than to the 
artistic interest of its readers. The wonderful style 
that makes its original so beautiful that we half 
excuse its unashamed utterance has disappeared 
utterly in the present version, and little is left us 
save a vulgar tale of passion. No wonder that the 
translator is ashamed to set his name to the thing. 

"The Fire of Life," by Mr. Charles Kennett 
Burrow, is a remarkably well-written and pleasing 
work of fiction, compounded of the elements that are 
most familiar to novel-readers, yet made fresh and 
charming by skilful treatment. It is true that 
" the fire of life," as it appears to the author, 
is a sentimental glow rather than a volcanic outburst 
of passion, and the book might safely be admitted 
to a Sunday School collection. But it deserves 
a wider audience than it could secure in that way, 
for, within its limitations, it is a successful produc- 
tion, sweet, wholesome, and almost strong. 

" The Millionaires " is a story of English society 
by Mr. F. Frankfort Moore, who has done work so 
much better in the past that we hardly recognize 
his hand in the present case. In his effort to show 
how appallingly clever he can be he makes all of 
his characters speak a language as unlike that of 
rational human beings as could easily be imagined. 
If the novel were frankly put forward as a burlesque 
like " The Londoners " of Mr. Hichens it 
might pass muster ; but there is unfortunately only 
too much evidence that the author expects to be 
taken seriously, which it is quite impossible to do.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



John of Strathbourne " is an unusually satis- 
factory romance of adventure in France and Italy 
during the stirring days of the early sixteenth cen- 
tury. It is the kind of story that Mr. Weyman and 
others have told so many times, hut no hotter, to 
our thinking, than the comparatively unknown pres- 
ent writer. There are perils and escapes without 
end, and the usual haughty and high-born maiden 
who scorns the hero at first, and throws herself into 
his arms at the close. We can heartily commend 
it for entertainment with a modicum of instruction. 

Mr. Frank Savile, who by way of childish mysti- 
fication spells his name backward, is the author 
of "John Ship, Mariner," a reasonably stirring 
tale of the Spanish Armada. The hero is an English 
youth who runs away from home, sails to Guinea with 
Hawkins, is captured by Spaniards and falls a vic- 
tim to the Inquisition. Forced to sail as a pilot with 
the Armada, he escapes in the storm and lands upon 
the Faroe Islands, where he wins both love and 
fortune, the latter in the shape of the treasure 
contained in a sunken Spanish galleon. The story 
is like a hundred others of the sort, told in the first 
person for the sake of the hero's children, and well 
managed as to its episodes and its outcome. 

In " The Making of a Saint " we have a story 
of fifteenth-century Italian life intrigue, amorous 
adventure, and assassination being its chief elements. 
The scene is Forli, and the action relates to the con- 
spiracy against a tyrant, who is murdered, and the 
revenge taken upon the murderers by his vindictive 
widow. Somewhat abruptly, we learn at the close 
that the narrator and principal figure became a monk, 
but this is not enough to account for such a title as is 
given to the romance. There is nothing to indi- 
cate the " making," in any psychological sense, 
of " a saint " out of the swaggering adventurer who 
tells the story, nothing, in fact, anywhere in the book, 
to make it more than an artificial surface chronicle 
of such incidents as made up the substance of aristo- 
cratic life in every Italian state during the age of the 
despots. 

" When Knighthood Was in Flower " is a histor- 
ical romance of England in the sixteenth century, 
having for its theme the love of Charles Brandon, 
later Duke of Suffolk, and the Princess Mary Tudor, 
sister of King Hal. It is written in the familiar 
manner of affected archaism, and makes, as most 
such productions do, the impression of a group of 
moderns in historical masquerade. But the heroine 
is delineated in a very winsome way, and both plot 
and incident are skilfully managed. Read without 
too exacting a mind, there is much entertainment to 
be got from this story. 

One of the characters in " The Moral Imbeciles " 
is an admitted lunatic, and most of the others would 
seem to be promising candidates for an asylum. 
Things are all topsy-turvy in this farcical perform- 
ance. The hero is a reformed forger who becomes 
a street-car conductor, and makes desperate love 
to the ugly heroine a woman with an aggressive 
sense of duty who is yet morally as imbecile as any 



of the queer people with whom she is associated. 
There is another heroine, described as beautiful, 
who always contrives to have her own way, and ends 
by marrying a country bumpkin. The most amusing 
figure in this gallery is that of the lunatic, and he 
at least does not keep us puzzled in the attempt 
to fit his words and acts into any kind of rational 
scheme. 

Miss Ellen Glasgow, whose strong novel, " The 
Descendant," attracted much attention a year or 
so ago, has published a second story with the strange 
title, " Phases of an Inferior Planet." What this 
means we hardly venture to say. Mercury and 
Venus are the only inferior planets known to astron- 
omy, and Miss Glasgow's story is distinctly one of this 
mundane sphere. Probably the title aims to suggest 
the faultiness of earthly existence, an impression 
fortified by perusal of the novel, which tells us 
of human lives turned awry in the most perverse 
fashion. We can hardly wax sympathetic over a 
hero who learns nothing more from suffering than 
to make his career a living lie, and the heroine, 
winsome as she is in the earlier chapters, loses hold 
upon our interest when she deserts her husband for 
a life of ease such as he is unable to secure for her. 
The book has alternations of vivacity and sombre 
strength that make it undeniably interesting, but 
seems to be based upon no controlling idea except 
that of two mismated people, and the wretchedness 
that invades the life of husband and wife when 
neither of them can possibly understand the tem- 
perament of the other.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

That sane and practical thinker on 
literary affairs, called Max Beer- 
bohm, recently announced that it is 
one of the grievous signs of the times that there 
is at present no campaign of satire and ridicule 
of youthful genius. Everybody is praised and en- 
couraged and helped. The only ebullition he finds 
to jeer at is the Celtic Renascence ; and his own 
modest fling at this movement seems to him one of 
the most hopeful indications on the literary horizon. 
We have often agreed with Mr. Max Beerbohm, 
but we cannot agree with him here. We persist in 
taking the Celtic Renascence seriously, and we lose 
no opportunity to inform the public that its message 
is unsound. America shall not follow the will-o'-the- 
wisp of Neo-Celtic doctrine if we can help it. Still, 
we must confess that " The Shadow of Arvor " by 
Miss Edith Wingate Rinder (Patrick Geddes, Edin- 
burgh) though not a new gospel, is rather a nice 
book. We like it. on the whole, better than the 
recondite labors of Mr. Yeats or Miss Fiona Mac- 
leod. It rings truer, and for this there is a rea- 
son, namely, that, so far as we can see, it is truer.

writings of the following Breton folk-lorists and 
romancers " and then follow the names of a num- 
ber of French writers, most of whom are not easily 
accessible to the general reader. The precise rela- 
tion to their originals of the several stories of which 
the book is made up does not wholly appear, but 
the book has as a whole a good deal of the charm 
of the true peasant legend of France. For now 
neo-Celticism, having struck the lyre of Taliesin of 
Wales, of Garselit " the Irishman whom it is safe to 
follow," of de-Macphersonized Ossian, proceeds as 
it were to strike hands across the sea and arouses 
the legendary romance of Brittany ; nor is the re- 
sult unworthy. These tales are some ancient, some 
modern, but all worth reading, for each one has 
written in it much of charming old-time fancy or 
thought suffused in something of the old-time atmos- 
phere. There may also be some mystic message, as 
is common in Neo-Celticism ; but if there is, we 
content ourselves with Mr. Gleeson White's remark 
on the same element as possibly existing in Mr. 
Herbert McNair's Celtic designs for furniture : " If 
it be present there," said he, " it is too subtly indi- 
cated to be apparent to a mere matter-of-fact South- 
erner." This is as it should be : so long as there is 
no danger of their being infected with Neo-Celtic 
doctrine, we are glad that our readers should have 
the pleasure they may get from this very attractive 
book. 

" Essays, Mock-Essays, and Charac- 
ter Sketches " ( Macmillan ) is the 
title of a volume of reprints from the 
"Journal of Education," that needs no apology. 
With a few exceptions, the papers are worth pre- 
serving. They are mainly of an educational cast, 
but they are untechnical and appeal to lay as well 
as professional readers. The group of " Mock- 
Essays " seems to call for special comment. It con- 
sists of a group of six brief papers selected from a 
mass of compositions sent in to the publishers in 
response to an offer of prizes for the best imitations 
of the standard essayists. Of the specimens given 
in the volume one is after Dr. Holmes, one after 
Lamb, and four are after Bacon a long way after 
him, we must say, though the Baconian sententious- 
ness is cleverly parodied in some cases. Mr. C. Law- 
rence Ford's " On the Shaking of Hands " (after 
Lamb) strikes us as rather the best paper of the 
lot, considered as an imitation ; while Mrs. Tolle- 
mache's " The Sparrow Colonel " (after Dr. Holmes) 
is a pretty thing in itself, delicate and pathetic, 
though it savors, to our thinking, but faintly of the 
" Autocrat." Other notable essays in the volume 
are " Mental Culture," by Prof. James Ward ; "Art 
in Schools," by Dean Farrar ; "What is a Col- 
lege ? " by Mark Pattison ; " Jowett and his Per- 
sonal Influence," by the Hon. L. A. Tollemache ; 
" Head-Masters I have Known," by C. S. Calverley. 
All in all, the papers in point of pith and sound 
intention worthily represent the useful publication 
they were written for. 



Completion of B 7 the publication of a third volume, 
a masterpiece one of the most important works of 
of science. science ever undertaken in this coun- 

try is now completed. " An Illustrated Flora of the 
Northern United States, Canada, and the British 
Possessions" (Scribner), by Dr. Nathaniel Lord 
Britton and the Hon. Addison Brown, is the only 
work of its kind that provides illustrations, drawn 
carefully to scale, of every species of flowering plant 
known to exist in the vast territory included be- 
tween Newfoundland and the southern boundary of 
Virginia, between the Atlantic Ocean and the 102d 
meridian. The concluding volume, now before us, 
is devoted entirely to the Gamopetalae not brought 
within the scope of the preceding volume, and nearly 
one-half of its contents are taken up by the Com- 
positse alone. The number of species figured in the 
whole work is 4162, comprising 177 families and 
1103 genera. Of these species, eighty-one are either 
new discoveries or new determinations, and are given 
in an appendix. Two elaborate indexes, of Latin 
and English names respectively, fill the closing 
pages of the volume. The latter of these indexes is 
the most thoroughgoing catalogue of popular plant- 
names in English that has ever been made, and is 
invaluable for purposes of identification by those 
who do not know how to use the analytical keys also 
provided. It is difficult to find words of praise high 
enough for the three volumes of this magnificent 
work, which is commended alike by its scientific 
thoroughness, the speed with which it has been 
pushed to completion, and the moderate price at 
which it is offered to the public.

explorations in New Guinea, and for works upon 
craniology and New Guinean arts. He is also a 
popular lecturer and teacher. He is well qualified 
to write a little book for popular reading in order 
to show the methods pursued in " The Study of 
Man," and to exhibit some of the results of such 
study. In the book before us (Vol. I. of " The 
Science Series," Putnam) he first discusses work 
in Physical Anthropology. A general statement is 
given concerning measurements and their import- 
ance. " Hair and Eye-color," " Value of Head- 
form in Anthropology," and " The Nose " are 
discussed and examples are given of their practical 
value. In the chapter on " Ethnography of the 
Dordogne District," an illustration is given of the 
way in which such physical data, when carefully 
gathered and properly handled analytically and 
synthetically throw light on the movements and 
ethnic elements of populations. Two chapters then 
are devoted to the evolution of the cart and the 
origin of the Irish jaunting-car, in order to show 
the character of the data used in culture-history 
and the mode of dealing with them. In a con-

[Sept. 16, 



nected series of eight chapters, Mr. Haddon next 
studies the toys and games of children. That these 
are material for study is vaguely admitted by 
many persons who cannot at all see just how or 
why they are important. Mr. Haddon tries to 
show this. In his concluding chapter the author 
brings together a considerable mass of practical 
suggestions for conducting ethnographical investi- 
gations in the British Islands. These are largely 
taken from the various circulars sent out by the 
Ethnographical Survey of the United Kingdom. 
They are of course of value outside of Great Britain. 
One point greatly emphasized in Mr. H addon's 
book is that every one can find work in the anthro- 
pological field. 

So exceptional a career as that of the 
late Rev. diaries Haddon Spurgeon 
must needs find an exceptional chron- 
icling. Accordingly it is with little surprise that 
we pick up the first of four formidable volumes 
containing his "autobiography as compiled from 
his papers by his wife and private secretary." The 
size of the undertaking is nothing short of appalling ; 
yet it must have been no slight task to reduce it to 
its present dimensions. Spurgeon himself says that 
his life was so replete that he could have constructed 
a three-volume novel from the doings of any single 
day within its compass making him a potential 
and ecclesiastical Crawford, so to speak. This pre- 
cise literary feat remained unaccomplished, but he 
came perilously near to it, as the labors of the edi- 
tors here indicate. It must be confessed that there 
is nothing in this first volume, which carries the 
story on through thirty-three chapters to the chol- 
era years (1866) in London, to remove the im- 
pression of Spurgeon which prevails generally. 
Just as his methods lacked fineness, but not results, 
just so the character he discloses through the writ- 
ings which he designed to serve as his memorial 
before the world shows force, not culture, persist- 
ency, not subtlety, aggressiveness, not suppression. 
A man of many graces in the theological sense 
of the word, he lacked the grace that makes for 
literary ease, bearing out the frequently repeated 
phrase that speeches and sermons which sound well 
seldom read well. The book is published by the 
Fleming H. Revell Co. in a form that must make 
a popular appeal. 

<^^ta Whether speculation is a good or an 
of ipc*iatio*. ev 'l thing on the whole, has been a 
difficult question for the economists, 
perhaps because there is so much to be said on either 
side. Dr. Henry Crosby Emery has certainly found 
a great deal to say in favor of purely speculative 
transactions in his essay entitled " Speculation on 
the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United 
States" (Columbia University Studies). After de- 
scribing the organization and business methods of 
the exchanges, discussing the economic difference 
between speculation and gambling, and briefly 
sketching the historical development of trade, the 



writer explains how speculation performs an im- 
portant economic function by regulating prices and 
shifting the burden of risk from producers and 
dealers proper to a distinct speculative class. It 
appears that this shifting of risks is accomplished 
by means of a systematic practice of hedging," 
now indulged in so generally by those who handle 
the actual grain and cotton that the large dealer 
who does not buy and sell at the same time has 
come to be considered a reckless speculator. There 
is a chapter on " Some Evils of Speculation," de- 
voted mainly to manipulations of the stock market ; 
" corners " are regarded as of little importance be- 
cause of their temporary character. The author 
apologizes for devoting so little space to this side of 
the question, but says that while the evils of specu- 
lation are more widely appreciated than the advant- 
ages, they are really not so simple of comprehension 
or so easily described. In the Exchange be finds 
the essence of both the good and the evil of the 
modern commercial system. 



Early partiet 
and politic* in 
the Nort/ncett. 



Volume VI. of the " Harvard His- 
torical Studies" (Longmans) con- 
tains a history of the Liberty and 
Free Soil parties in the Northwest, written by Mr. 
Theodore Clarke Smith, Instructor in the University 
of Michigan. The paper gained the Tappan prize 
for 1896. The period considered begins with the 
anti-slavery struggles in 1830 and extends to the 
organization of the Republican party in 1854, cov- 
ering the rise and fall of the semi-parties known as 
Liberty, Free Soil, and Free Democratic. These 
organizations " stirred up the Western conscience, 
kept the subject of slavery constantly before the 
public, powerfully affected the policy and public 
expressions of the old parties, and by their spokes- 
men in Congress played an influential part in 
national politics." They further trained men in 
political methods, hardened young men to self- 
abnegation, and accustomed voters to a steady ad- 
herence to a great principle in the face of opposition, 
contempt, and abuse, to do right for right's sake. 
The investigation in local sources has been most 
exhaustive and painstaking, and forms a complete 
r6sum of political life within the period and the 
region under consideration. Appendices of biblio- 
graphy, tables, and charts of votes, etc., complete a 
very scholarly volume in a very scholarly series. 



An etiay 
oneriticim. 



" The Principles of Criticism," fur- 
ther described as " an introduction 
to the study of literature," is an essay 
by Mr. W. Basil Worsfold, recently published in 
London by Mr. George Allen. Its purpose " is to 
present an account of the main principles of literary 
criticism and to illustrate these principles by passages 
from great writers." It may be said at the outset 
that, while Mr. Worsfold's discussion of his subject 
is sober and scholarly, being at all points both read- 
able and interesting, it breaks no new ground, and 
is content with an exposition of the orthodox prin-

ciples of criticism as they have been received from 
the past and amplified by a few distinguished writers 
of our own time. The author does not for a moment 
doubt that there are such things as principles in this 
matter, and does not seem to think the opinion 
of the subjective and impressionist critics deserv- 
ing of refutation or even of consideration. In this, 
it need hardly be said, we are in agreement with 
Mr. Worsfold, and his discussion seems to us emi- 
nently sound and well arranged. His chief service 
is perhaps in the bringing together of what he lightly 
calls " a collection of noteworthy critical utterances." 
This marshalling, with appropriate comment, of sig- 
nificant passages from the writings of Plato, Aris- 
totle, Addison, Lessing, Cousin, and Arnold, to 
name the six critics chiefly singled out for treat- 
ment, is a performance for which the author has 
our warmest thanks, although the attention given 
to Addison and Cousin is possibly disproportional, 
and although we would gladly have seen the list less 
restricted. Special chapters upon poetry, the drama, 
and the novel, follow this general setting forth of criti- 
cal principles, and a chapter upon "Authority in Liter- 
ature and Art" closes the essay. 

Judged by such books as Mr. Spencer 
Cask's "Bowling Green" (Put- 
nam), Americans are still a long 
way off from taking their newly discovered ances- 
tors as a matter of course. It is an interesting and 
skilfully put together little volume about an essential 
feature in old New York life, historically faithful 
so far as it goes, and of a certain consequence to all 
who look upon that sort of thing as consequential. 
It is a remarkable thing to notice how much the 
early days improve with age ; all the disagreeable 
features of life, unless they can be charged to Great 
Britain during the two wars, disappear. It was no 
unusual thing for convicts and other undesirable 
persons to be sent to America by the ship-load ; yet 
the only descendants they appear to have left be- 
hind them are those " poor whites " in the South 
who have no spokesman before the world to deny 
it. Still, the book serves a useful if a limited pur- 
pose. But what does Mr. Trask mean by calling 
Broadway " the longest street in the world " ? This 
western country is full of highways that run from the 
great lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, and bid fair to be 
continued on to Terra del Fuego with the national 

expansion. 

Animal Psychology is just now a 
much cultivated department, and 
Mrs. E. L. Baldwin's translation of 
the pioneer monograph of Professor Groos, " The 
Play of Animals " (Appleton), is very timely. The 
work opens with a criticism of Mr. Spencer's theory 
of play ; in the second chapter it discusses play and 
instinct ; and following chapters treat particular 
plays under a classification into " experimentation, 
movement plays, hunting plays, fighting plays, con- 
structive arts, nursing plays, imitative play, curi- 
osity, love plays." The concluding chapter deals 



with the psychology of play. Professor Groos holds 
that play has been evolved as instinct acting in a 
manner to prepare for the work of mature life ; in 
short, that play is nature's school. The pappy play- 
ing with his brother, chasing and biting not seri- 
ously, thereby practises for the mature life when he 
must chase and bite in earnest. This theory is en- 
forced by many stories of animals, as reported by 
travellers, naturalists, and others. The psychic basis 
of play the author finds in make-believe as implying 
the joy of power and freedom. While the work is 
not always clear in its construction, and is greatly 
overcharged with quotations and foot-notes, yet it is 
a useful and suggestive volume. The editor, Pro- 
fessor J. M. Baldwin, contributes a preface, and 
also an appendix on Organic Selection. The trans- 
lation is in good readable English. 



A handbook 
of practical 
taxidermy. 



For a number of years the exhibits 
of the taxidermist's art in the Amer- 
ican Museum of Natural History in 
New York City have excited the admiration of vis- 
iting naturalists. Representations of animals, not 
only in their natural attitudes but also in their nat- 
ural surroundings, have been successfully made by 
Mr. John Rowley, the chief of the department of 
taxidermy in the above-mentioned institution. He 
has put into print an excellent handbook of his art 
(Appleton) which will be welcomed by everyone 
interested in the artistic development of public mu- 
seums. The book is not an elaborate treatise upon 
the abstract principles which lie at the foundation 
of artistic taxidermy, but is rather a compendium 
full of practical hints and suggestions, recipes, and 
formulas for the working taxidermist. The outfit 
necessary for a collecting trip and the routine of 
field work are discussed in the opening chapter, 
while succeeding ones deal with tools and material ; 
casting in wax, papier-mache, clay, and plaster ; the 
mounting of birds and mammals ; of fishes, reptiles, 
and crustaceans ; the preparations of skeletons ; and 
the reproduction of foliage. A valuable appendix 
gives the sources from which the various materials 
may be obtained. The abundant illustrations en- 
hance the utility of the work, and render it a most 
complete and reliable handbook of the subject. 

The voluminous work on " The Cross 

^ ^^ ^ ^ 

in Tradition, History, and Art 
and history. (Putnam), from the pen of the late 

Rev. William Wood Seymour, is confined chiefly to 
the Christian uses and significance of this important 
symbol. It has not been noted that one reason why 
the cross is so widely diffused, in its uses as a symbol 
and an ornament over the face of the earth, is be- 
cause of the great ease with which it is arrived at. 
Wherever a man has been able to make marks the 
cross is found for precisely the reason that it is still 
used by the illiterate instead of a signature because 
any two lines in the same plane must, if they are 
not parallel, form a cross either actually by contact 
or potentially by extension. The claim of phallicism

to be heard in the matter is dismissed in this ex- 
ceedingly ponderous work with a single contemptu- 
ous sentence. The author practically suppresses all 
attempt to deal with what is certainly a much vexed 
subject, apparently oblivious to the fact that in this 
year of grace 1898 there are probably more human 
beings who attach a phallic significance to the cross 
than there are members of any other religion who 
hold it as a sacred symbol. Only less conspicuous 
is the failure of the book to recognize the enormous 
growth of superstition, in all religions, about this as 
other ancient symbols. There is a lack of ability 
to discriminate between authorities of the most 
various weight, and a fatal facility for taking up 
obsolete views for discussion, which prevent the book 
from attaining any considerable importance as a 
philosophical or historical treatise, notwithstanding 
that its size and manner are scarcely less than 
encyclopedic. 

The early life of Orestes A. Brown- 
8on tnat extraordinary American 
who was in turn Congregationalist, 
Universalist, Unitarian, Nothing-in-particular, and 
Roman Catholic, and in this last capacity succeeded 
in making permanent contributions to the philosophy 
of a Church which has always owed much to her 
adopted children, has been set forth with loving 
care and all reasonable inclusiveness by his son, Mr. 
Henry F. Brownson, who publishes the volume pri- 
vately in Detroit. So long a distance is it from 
Brook Farm to Mother Church, that many must lag 
by the way it would really seem as if none could 
follow to the goal without an understanding of and 
sympathy with the Church which has not often been 
given to the American of ancient descent There 
is no doubt of the accuracy of Channing's charitable 
statement that Brownson's many changes were in 
the nature of an orderly and logical progression ; 
like Professor Silliman, he tired of the burden of his 
own individuality, so strongly was it marked, and 
gladly reposed it upon shoulders which deem them- 
selves broad enough for an entire world. Many 
another of his countrymen has trod the same path 
for the same reason, and it is to them that " Brown- 
son's Early Life " will make its chief appeal. 

TV/nnfnfcii Richard Grant White long ago called

women possess for felicitous letter- 
writing, which was, indeed, an accepted literary 
fact from an early day, for all Richardson tried to 
spoil it The Letters of Mary Sibylla Holland " 
( Edward Arnold ), edited by her son, Mr. Bernard 
Holland, serve further to remind the reader that 
there is coming to be no end of book-making as a 
result of this feminine facility. Mrs. Holland's 
husband was the Rev. Francis James Holland, 
chaplain-in-ordinary to the Queen and for many 
years a canon of Canterbury. To Mrs. Holland it 
was therefore given to meet many persons notable 
in diverse walks of life. Such sketches as are inev-

itable, when a bright woman so placed has a number 
of correspondents, follow, as the night the day ; and 
this inevitability lasts quite up to the point of pub-

tiously discharged, and in that view not amenable 
to criticism either respecting manner or matter. 

' ' u ' excellent example of combining 
the charm of literary workmanship 
w ; th the eg8e ntial8 of a guide book, 
which may possibly be traced to Sir John Maunde- 
ville and certainly to Mr. Augustus J. C. Hare, has 
been satisfactorily followed by Miss Margaret Sy- 
monds, whose collaboratorship with her distinguished 
father, the late John Addington Symonds, has here 
been transferred to Miss Lina Duff Gordon. Jointly 
these two capable women have woven " The Story 
of Perugia " into a volume for the " Mediaeval 
Towns " series, which is published by J. M. Dent 
& Co. with all the care that marks their little 
books generally, and imported by the Macmillan Co. 
Judiciously intermingling the historical past with 
the existing present, and holding a great deal of 
antiquarian knowledge back with great good sense, 
a really valuable as well as entertaining book re- 
sults, profitable to the reader and creditable to the 
writers and publisher. 



BRIEFER MEN TION. 

In commenting upon the 1898 volume of " The Ref- 
erence Catalogue of Current Literature," we are com- 
pelled to resort to the first principles of reviewing, and 
describe the work as being twelve inches in thickness 
and weighing about the same number of pounds. This 
year it is for the first time divided into two volumes. As 
all booksellers know, it consists of the catalogues of 
about a hundred and fifty English publishing houses, 
alphabetically bound together, and provided with an 
index classified according to subjects, titles, and authors. 
This index fills between five and six hundred pages, and 
contains nearly one hundred thousand entries. The 
work is issued by Messrs J. Whitaker & Sons, London, 
and supplied in this country through the agency of " The 
Publisher's Weekly." 

Under the editorship of Professor Shailer Mathews, 
a series of " New Testament Handbooks " has been 
planned by the Macmillan Co. They will be small 
volumes, not too technical for the general reader, and 
will enlist the services of such careful scholars as the 
editor himself, and Professors Marvin R. Vincent, 
Henry S. Nash, George B. Stevens, and Francis 6. Pea- 
body. Particulars of ten volumes are comprised in the 
preliminary announcement, and others will be announced 
later. 

The Jewish Publication Society, having its headquar- 
ters in Philadelphia, issues a report for the tenth year 
of its existence, and shows an admirable amount of work 
done in the way of stimulating intellectual effort and 
the publication of important Jewish works. The Society 
numbers nearly five thousand members, and has a num- 
ber of valuable books on its list, the most noteworthy 
being the six-volume " History of the Jews," by Pro- 
fessor Graetz.

ANNOUNCEMENTS or FAL.I/ BOOKS. 

THE DIAL'S list of books announced for Fall issue by 
American publishers, which has become an important 
annual bibliographical feature of the paper, contains 
this year 1350 titles, very much the largest list THE 
DIAL has ever before given its readers, being nearly 
twenty-five per cent, ahead of that given a year ago. 
Seventy-one publishers are represented, the average thus 
being nearly twenty books to a firm. Book readers are 
certainly to be congratulated on this liberal provision for 
their entertainment, and the showing is one that reflects 
great credit on the energy of the American publishers 
in being amply prepared for the opening of what 
promises to be the greatest period of prosperity ever 
known in this country. 

The List has been prepared in all cases from advance 
information procured especially for the purpose. The 
department of Juveniles is deferred until our next 
number. All the books here given are presumably 
new books new editions not being included unless 
having new form or matter; and the List does not 
include Fall books already issued and entered in our 
regular List of New Books.

LITERARY 



A Child- World," by Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, 
forms Volume X. of the uniform library edition of that 
writer's works, published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. 

Mr. Rudyard Kipling's " Barrack Room Ballads," 
together with the " Recessional " and some miscellan- 
eous poems, is issued by Mr. William Doxey in his neat 
little series of " Lark Classics." 

Messrs. Way & Williams of Chicago announce the 
transfer of their publishing business to Messrs. H. S. 
Stone & Co. of the same city. 

Volume VIII. of the "Cornell Studies in Classical 
Philology " is devoted to a monograph, by Dr. Fred 
Orlando Bates, upon " The Five Post-Kleisthenean 
Tribes." It is published by the Macmillan Co. 

"Stories of Ohio," by Mr. W. D. Howells, and 
" Stories of Indiana," by Mr. Maurice Thompson, are 
just published by the American Book Co. in their 
admirable series of reading-books for the schools of 
the several States. 

Beginning with the September issue, " Self-Culture " 
announces a considerable increase in size and scope, and 
a reduction in price to one dollar per year. The maga- 
zine is now under the business management of Mr. C. W. 
Chase, formerly connected with " The Forum." 

Six " Old South Leaflets," recently added to this 
valuable series, are the following : " The Founding of 
St. Augustine," " Amerigo Vespucci's Account of His 
Third Voyage," "The Founding of Quebec," "The 
First Voyage to Roanoke," " The Settlement of Lon- 
donderry, N. H.," and " Pastorius's Description of 
Pennsylvania." 

A volume of selections from Walter Savage Landor, 
edited by Mr. W. B. S. Clymer, is published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. in their " Athenaeum Press Series." The aim 
of the editor has been to give the best things in the selec- 
tions made by Mr. Hillard and Mr. Sidney Colvin, 
together with some extracts not included by either 
of these editors. 

"Plant Life, Considered with Special Reference to 
Form and Function " (Holt) is a new text-book of bot- 
any by Professor Charles Reid Barnes. It is designed 
for secondary schools, and is a work of the most ap- 
proved modern type, taking the laboratory method of 
instruction for granted, and as different as can be from 
the old-fashioned botanical manuals of twenty years 
ago. 

Perhaps more than the usual number of distinguished 
foreign authors expect to visit the United States dur- 
ing the coming months. Mr. Zangwill and Mr. 
Benjamin Kidd are already here, and there are reports, 
more or less authentic, of the coming of Mr. Henryk 
Senkiewicz, Mr. Hall Caine, Mr. Alfred Austin, Mr. 
Justin H. McCarthy, " John Oliver Hobbes," and, 
possibly, M. Zola. 

The "What is Worth While" series of booklets, 
published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., has just 
received the following accessions: "The Best Life," 
by Dr. C. F. Thwing; " Blessed Are the Cross-Bearers," 
by Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll; The Christian Ideal," by 
the Rev. J. Guinness Rogers; "The Culture of Man- 
hood," by Mr. Silas K. Hocking; "The Everlasting 
Arms," by Dr. Francis E. Clark; Ideal Motherhood," 
by Miss Minnie S. Davis; " The Marriage Altar," by the

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



Rev. J. R. Miller; " The Fruit of the Vine," by the Rev. 
Andrew Murray; and " What a Carpenter Did with his 
Bible," by Professor John H. Genung. These booklets 
are very daintily bound in flowered white cloth, and are 
to be recommended for gifts of the inexpensive sort. 

The little books published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell 
in their Faience " edition, are favorably known for 
their neatness and modest charm of execution. The 
additions to the series for this year include " Hia- 
watha," ' The House of Seven Gables," Poe's " Poems " 
and " Tales," ' The Complete Angler," Shakespeare's 
" Songs and Sonnets," and the ever-charming "Collette" 
of Mile. Jeanne Schultz. Each volume has a photo- 
gravure frontispiece, and a tastefully-decorated cover. 

Two English translations of Count Tolstoy's " What 
is Art ? " have reached us almost simultaneously, the 
one, made by Mr. Aylmer Maude, and published by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., the other made by Mr. 
Charles Johnston, and published by Mr. Henry Alte- 
mus. The former includes an " Author's Preface " not 
found in the latter, and thus seems to be the authorized 
edition. The work was reviewed by us from the Rus- 
sian original, some months ago, as our readers will 
doubtless remember. 

Mr. Stan. V. Henkels will sell, late in October, at the 
Philadelphia auction rooms of Messrs. Davis & Harvey, 
the valuable private library of a well-known Philadel- 
phia collector. The collection comprises rare Ameri- 
cana, Frankliniana, early American Bibles and prayer- 
books, first American editions of English classics, a 
large array of Junius literature, and several important 
historical manuscripts. An illustrated catalogue is 
being prepared by Mr. Henkels, and may be had by 
addressing him at 1112 Walnut St., Philadelphia. 

Theron S. E. Dixon, of Chicago, whom readers of 
THE DIAL will remember as a contributor to its pages, 
was drowned Sept. 14 at Virginia Beach, Va., while 
endeavoring to save the life of a friend. Mr. Dixon 
was a prominent patent lawyer, and was connected with 
many important cases, notably the suit testing the valid- 
ity of the Bell Telephone patents, which was carried 
before the Supreme Court of the United States. He 
was an earnest literary worker, and devoted much time 
to the Baconian theory of Shakespeare, being the author 
of an original work on the subject, " Francis Bacon and 
his Shakespeare," published in 1895. Mr. Dixon was 
fifty-three years of age. 

Judge Thomas M. Cooley, the distinguished jurist and 
constitutional lawyer, died Sept. 12 at his home in Ann 
Arbor, Mich., at the age of seventy-four. Judge Cooley 
was born in Attica, N. Y., and went to Michigan in 1843. 
In 1857 be made a compilation of the Michigan statutes. 
In 1858 he was appointed reporter of the Supreme 
Court, a position which he retained until 1865, issuing 
eight volumes of reports. In the meantime,' in 1865, 
he had been made a professor in the University of 
Michigan, and in 1864 he was elected to fill a vacancy 
on the Supreme bench of the state. Five years later 
he was reflected for the full term of eight years. In 
1868-9 he was chief justice, and in 1885 he retired per- 
manently from the bench. In 1881 he became professor 
of constitutional and administrative law in the Univers- 
ity of Michigan. He passed from that to the chair of 
American history in the same institution, retaining a 
lectureship in constitutional law and acting as dean of 
the school of political science. In late years he has 
been granted leave of absence, giving a brief course of 



lectures each year on questions of interstate law. In 
1887 Judge Cooley was appointed by the President a 
member of the first commission serving under the Inter- 
state Commerce Act, acting as chairman of the com- 
mission. He is the author of a number of legal works 
that are accounted authorities, and was a frequent con- 
tributor to the pages of THE DIAL.

QUALITY RATHER THAN QUANTITY. 

Professor Eliot, of Harvard, says : 

" The International is a wonderfully compact storehouse of accurate information." 



The International is Scientific and 
Practical. 

Words are easily found. Pronunciation 
is easily ascertained. Meanings are easily 
learned. The growth of words is easily 
traced, and excellence of quality rather 
than superfluity of quantity characterizes 
its every department.

which follow in their arrangement no systematic order, except as they 
all relate to the one topic of spiritual life in Christ. They make the 
impression of selections from the diary of the exalted saint, rapt in the 
experiences of a holy life. They are mediaeval, as a matter of course ; 
but they also appeal to the reader with the power which belongs to 
rapturous devotion." The Independent (New York).

HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & COMPANY'S 

NEW BOOKS FOR EARLY AUTUMN. 



Poetical Works of Alfred, Lord 
Tennyson. 

Cambridge Edition, uniform with the Cambridge Long- 
fellow, Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, Browning and Burns. 
With a Biographical Sketch and Notes, by WILLIAM 
J. ROLFE, Indexes to Titles and First Lines, a portrait, 
and an engraved title-page with a vignette. Large 
crown 8vo, $2.00. 

The distinctive features of this edition are (1) accu- 
racy of text, (2) ample equipment of notes, (3) num- 
bering of the lines, (4) thin opaque paper, making a 
convenient volume, and (5) type of good size. 

The Puritans. 
By ARLO BATES, author of " The Pagans," The 
Philistines," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

Mr. Bates reaches a higher level in this novel than 
in any he has before written. The three stories, " The 
Pagans," " The Philistines," and " The Puritans," are 
parts of a study of the effects of Puritanism upon the 
character of those who have nominally outgrown it. 
Two young High Churchmen are brought into contact 
with worldliness, the semi-serious who devise ethical 
amusements, the ultra-fashionable who take great inter- 
est in the campaign for the election of a bishop, and 
love enters into the drama. It is a thoughtful story, 
and can hardly fail to attract much attention. 

A Century of Indian Epigrams. 
Chiefly from the Sanskrit of Bhartrihari. By 
PAUL E. MORE, author of "The Great Refusal." 
16mo, $1.00. 

A tasteful book containing lyrical translations of a 
hundred epigrams, meditations, and precepts ascribed 
to Bhartrihari, a Hindu king and sage, who lived in the 
early part of the Christian era. They treat of love, 
worldly wisdom, and the Hindu religion and philosophy. 
Mr. More prefixes an interesting introduction to his 
skilful translation. 

The Bibliotaph and Other People. 
By LEON H. VINCEXT. 12mo, $1.50. 
This thoughtful book contains papers on an eccentric 
book-collector, Thomas Hardy, the Letters of Keats, An 
Elizabethan Novelist (John Lyly), Priestley's Autobi- 
ography, and Gautier. It ranks among the better and 
more judicious of recent volumes of essays. 



A 



Lover of Truth. 



By ELIZA ORNE WHITE, author of " Winter- 
borough," " A Browning Courtship," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
The scenes and characters of this novel belong to New 
England, which Miss White knows and describes so well. 
The story is named for a young man who insists on speak- 
ing the truth always, everywhere, in season and out of sea- 
son. The story is told with much brightness and humor. 



Looking Backward. 
By EDWARD BELLAMY. New Edition. With 
a portrait of Mr. Bellamy and a Biographical Sketch 
by SYLVESTER BAXTER. 12mo, $1.00; paper, 50 cts. 
The recent death of Mr. Bellamy calls attention anew 
to this remarkable story, which has had a wider reading 
than almost any other American book of this generation. 
This new edition will be valued for its good portrait, and 
for the sympathetic sketch by Mr. Baxter. 

The Blind Man's World, 
And Other Stories. By EDWARD BELLAMY. With 
Introductory Chapter by Mr. HOWELLS. 12mo, $1.50. 
Not only the multitude which has read with uncom- 
mon interest and sympathy Mr. Bellamy's phenomenal 
" Looking Backward," but all who enjoy good stories 
well told, will welcome this new book containing fifteen 
stories, now first gathered in a volume. They are 
thoroughly interesting, and have the humane imagina- 
tion and the eager purpose of improving social conditions 
which distinguishes all of Mr. Bellamy's writings. 

Prisoners of Hope. 
A Novel. By MARY JOHNSTON. With a Front- 
ispiece Illustration. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

A capital story of Virginia in 1663, when Berkeley 
was governor. A Puritan condemned for a crime of 
which he was innocent, was transported from England 
to Virginia. He became leader of tho famous Oliverian 
conspiracy, and had thrilling adventures by flood and 
field with ruffians, gentlemen, and Indians who stole 
the young woman whom he loved. The book gives an 
excellent picture of Colonial Virginia, and is a story of 
quite absorbing interest. 

Stories of the Cherokee Hills. 
By MAURICE THOMPSON, author of " A Talla- 
hassee Girl," etc. With eight full-page illustrations by 
E. W. KEMBLE. 12mo, $1.50. 

These stories belong to the same general place and 
time with Mr. Joel Chandler Harris's " Home Tales." 
They illustrate the simple primitive life of Northern 
Georgia, where Mr. Thompson spent his boyhood. 
They are mostly stories of masters and slaves, whose 
relations are usually friendly, with some fantastic or 
humorous element; and the stories with Mr. Kemble's 
illustrations make a very attractive book. 

The Story of Little Jane and Me. 
By M. E. Square 12mo, $1.00. 
A charming book for young girls. It is a story of 
actual childhood in New York city a half century ago. 
It gives an uncommonly truthful and humorous remin- 
iscence of child life, aud, like Miss White's " A Little 
Girl of Long Ago," will charm lovers of children and 
of quaint reminiscence no less than younger readers.

COMEDIES AND ERRORS. By Henry Harland. $1.50. 

The Pall Mall Gazelle (London) says : " Mr. Harland is a writer with a style and charm all his 
own. ' The House of Eulalie ' touches his high-water mark. There is a terrible pathos in this little 
sketch of the old peasant and his dead child which is unique." 

REGINA; or, THE SINS OF THE FATHERS. By Hermann Suder- 

mann. Translated by BEATRICE MARSHALL. Second Edition. $1.50. 

The New York Times says : " Regina is a notable piece of character drawing. She is a sort of 
German Tess of the d'Urbervilles. She is worth knowing. A creature of circumstances, with a wealth 
of high impulses, she is a veritable heroine of tragedy, foredoomed from the beginning. The story 
of her life is one of the most vivid pieces of fiction that have come into English in these days. It is 
worth reading by those who are not afraid of naked humanity." 

The. Chicago Evening Post says : " It is a masterly piece of work, and one of the most absorb- 
ingly interesting novels written in the last ten years."

The Brooklyn Eagle says : " Merits an unusual degree of approval, for the reason that it is a well 
written story, full of adventure, and breathing a more delicate spirit than some of Mr. Crockett's 
strenuous fiction. One of the cleverest stories having the unquiet times of the Stuarts for a back- 
ground that has recently been published. 

SOME NOTES OF A STRUGGLING GENIUS. By G. S. Street. 

Bodiey Booklets. 35 cents. 

The Bookman says : " Nearly as amusing as ' The Autobiography of a Boy.' ' The Genius ' takes 
you into his confidence in the most fascinating way." 

POEMS. By Stephen Phillips. Crown 8vo. Fourth Edition. Boards, $1.50. 

The London Times says : " Mr. Phillips is a poet, one of the half-dozen men of the younger 
generation whose writings contain the indefinable quality which makes for permanence." 

ADMIRALS ALL, AND OTHER POEMS. By Henry Newbolt. Wrap- 

pers. Fcap 8vo. 35 cents. 

The Pitttburg Leader says : " Mr. Newbolt's volume is made up of stirring sea verses which will 
find an echo in many American hearts just now. Henry Newbolt strikes the chord of British prowess 
until it thrills and sings again . . . the chord that Tennyson struck so superbly in the account of 
Sir Richard Grenville and the ' Revenge.' "

44 In the Cage/' a novel by HENRY JAMES, author of "What Maiaie Knew." 12mo. Cloth, 

uniform with What Maisie Knew," $1.25. 

" We could not wish for a better representation of the art of Mr. Henry James. ID appearance it is only a 
sketch of a girl who works the telegraph in an office that is part of a grocer's shop in the West End, but as 
background there is the extravagant world of fashion throwing out disjointed hints of vice and intrigue in mes- 
sages handed in as indifferently as if the operator were only part of the machine. Nevertheless, she is a woman 
too, and feminine interest and curiosity so quicken her wits that she is able to piece together ' the high encounter 
with life, the large and complicated game ' of her customers. This, in fact, is the romance in her life, the awak- 
ening touch to her imagination, and it is brought into skilful contrast with the passionless commonplace of her 
own love." Academy. 

* A Golden Sorrow," by MARIA LOUISE POOL. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

This novel was running serially in Godey's Magazine at the time of Miss Pool's death. It will not, however, 
be completed in that periodical, but will be issued at once in book form. It is a story of love and adventure in 
St. Augustine, much more exciting than Miss Pool's stories usually are, but with all her delightful sense of humor. 

44 The Money Captain," a novel by WILL PAYNE. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

With " Jerry the Dreamer" Mr. Payne was first brought before the public. His present book treats, in fiction 
form, of the government of our cities by large private corporations and the difficulties a man with wide business 
interests has to conduct his affairs honestly. It does not aim to show any new solution of municipal problems, but, 
in a dispassionate way, points out how materially the average community is affected. 

44 A Slave to Duty, and Other Women," by OCTAVE THANET. 16mo. Cloth, illus- 
trated, $1.25. 
Miss French has such a thoroughly established reputation among the present reading public that no further 

introduction to this collection of short stories will be necessary than to Eay that it is on a par with her previous 

books. 

44 Chap- Book Stories," Second Series. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

This is the second collection of the best short stories from the Chap-Book. Many well-known names are 
included in the table of contents, and the volume will undoubtedly meet with the success which was accorded to 
the first volume of the series on its appearance two years ago. 

44 Etiquette for Americans." I6mo. cioth, $1.25. 

It is probable that no woman thoroughly qualified to write upon this subject would be willing to sign her name 
to such a book. It is written by a person who is regarded all over the country as an authority upon the subject. 
Matters of good form are so constantly changing that there is at present a great need for a new book. 

44 The New Economy," a peaceful solution of the social problem, by LAURENCE GRONLUND, 
A.M., author of " The Cooperative Commonwealth," etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 
In his previous books the author has been criticised for his great dependence on theory, and not enough on 

fact. In his present work he proves how by simple and practical methods society can be materially changed within 

a short space of time. He advocates many new methods which will be found interesting and instructive, not only 

to students of sociology, but to the average reader as well. 



THE VICTORIAN ERA SERIES. 

The series is designed to form a record of the great movements and developments of the age, in politics, 
economics, religion, industry, literature, science and art, and of the life work of its typical and influential men. 

Under the general editorship of Mr. J. Holland Rose, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, Eng., 
the individual volumes will be contributed by leading specialists in the various branches of knowledge which fall 
to be treated in the series. 

The volumes will be issued at the rate of one a month. They will be handsomely bound in cloth, with good 
paper and large type, suitable for the library. Per volume, $1.25. 

The following volumes are now ready : 

" The Rise of Democracy," by J. HOLLAND ROSE, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge (Editor 
of the Series).

FIFTH THOUSAND OF 

FREE TO SERVE: A Tale of Colonial New York. 

By E. RAYNER. Price, $1.50. 

CLINTON Ross says in The Chap-Book : " The proof of a long book is in the reading of it. ... The author, 
an artist, never once obtrudes her personality. The life of the actors is cleverly real, but the high distinction of 
' Free to Serve ' is its realization of humanity. It is a notable book so much better than Hugh Wynne ' that 
if the publishers' claim for that book be true this novel is greater it is certainly one of the American novels 
of the year. And Dutch America has no better presentation than E. Rayner's in Free to Serve.' " 

The Boston Transcript says: " The book is not the work of a novice; it is fascinating, strong, and of the highest 
moral tone. . . . The characters are finely delineated, the varied and rapidly shifting scenes are pictured with 
the skill of an artist, and the pure moral tone is carried through the whole like a golden thread. We advise all 
to read the book." 

The Philadelphia Call says: "It does for the life and fashions of Old New York what Weir Mitchell's Hugh 
Wynne ' did for Philadelphia. . . . There is plenty of action in the transition from chapter to chapter, some 
strong-drawn character etching, and an intense vein of human interest. Few will pick up this tale without feeling 
the charm of its style and the subtle fascination of its subject-matter." 

SECOND EDITION OF 

HARVARD EPISODES. 

By CHARLES MACOMB FLANDRAU, '95. Crimson cloth, octavo. Price, $1.25. 

In this book Mr. Flandrau has departed widely from the usual college story. He has, in a series of short, 
vivid sketches, drawn the modern " Harvard man " as he ts, not as he has been, or as he ought to be, but truthfully 
as he is. The book does not, naturally, detail all sides of the present complex Harvard life, but for the side which 
it does treat, the typical, prosperous, happy side, it does the best thing tells the truth, and tells it in a most 
delightful fashion. We feel sure that so accurate a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn, and 
that all college men will appreciate this and heartily welcome the book.

THE NEW SABBATH LIBRARY. 

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION. 

To meet the growing demand for pure literature at popular prices, we began in April, 1898, the issue of a monthly publication entitled the 
NEW SABBATH LIBRARY. The success of these issues has proved to be unprecedented. Although appealing particularly to young people, 
they will interest all lovers of good and wholesome literature, whether young or old. 

The books are of uniform style and size (6 1-2x8 1-2), each containing 96 large pages in double column. They are handsomely printed on 
good paper, and fully illustrated. The covers are of heavy enameled paper, with beautifully engraved designs. 

Those who wish to procure this Library regularly may remit 60 cents for a year's subscription, being particular to state with which issue the 
subscription is to commence. Copies may be ordered of any of the books at the rate of 5 cents each. We prepay postage. 

CLOTH EDITIONS. We have also prepared special editions of all these books, printed on heavy paper, beautifully bound in heavy covers, 
cloth backs and corners, ornamented sides. Sent postpaid to any address on receipt of price, 25 cents per copy.

A Hero of Ticonderoga. 

By ROWLAND E. ROBINSON. 

There was an event in Vermont history in American 
history on Lake Champlain a hundred and twenty- 
three years ago that helped to shape the future of the 
new world, and will live as long as brave deeds are 
sung or told. 

That brave deed has been the subject of song, of 
history, and of romance, but it was never told in a more 
interesting way than in Rowland E. Robinson's new 
romance, " A Hero of Ticonderoga." 

The Rutland (Vt.) Herald says: 

" The little volume makes by far the best contribution yet published 
in a rich field which has been sadly neglected. Of course Mr. Robinson 
could hardly write without introducing some matter in the world of 
sport and giving some exquisite descriptions of natural sights and sounds. 
His admirers will be in no way disappointed by this volume, although 
it is in many respects a departure from anything he had before done." 

A HERO OF TICONDEROGA is a book for a 
Holiday, for the Home, and for the Library. With por- 
trait of the author, and cover designed by his daughter. 
Cloth, 16mo, 75 cents.

IMPORTANT BOOKS OF TRAVEL. ; 

THROUGH ASIA. 

By SVEN HEDIN. With Two Maps and Two Plates Printed in Colors, and about 280 Illustrations by the 
Author and from Photographs. About 1300 pages. Two Volumes. Large 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, 
Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops, (In press.) 

Dr. Sven Hedin's account of his extraordinary journey across the continent of Asia is one of the most thrilling narra- 
tives of endeavor, in the face of wellnigh overwhelming odds, which has ever been written. 

IN THE FORBIDDEN LAND. 

By A. H. SAVAGE LANDOR. Two Volumes. Copiously Illustrated. 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt 

Tops. (In press.) 

The purpose of Mr. Landor to explore southern Tibet and the course of the upper Brahmaputra caused him to suffer 
terrible hardships. When within a short distance of the mysterious city of Thasa he was seized and subjected to the 
cruelest tortures, his body was racked, his eyesight nearly extinguished, his face roasted, and finally he was placed upon 
a pony bearing a spiked saddle and so escorted out of the country. It is needless to say how interesting is this story of 
heroic endeavor and accomplishment. 

A THOUSAND DAYS IN THE ARCTIC. 

By F. G. JACKSON. Copiously Illustrated from Photographs. 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt Top. 
(In press.) 

With singular modesty and simplicity Mr. Jackson has told the story of his remarkable expedition into Franz-Josef 
land, and of the three years spent by his party in the midst of perpetual exposure and almost perpetual darkness.

to Bering Straits. By HARRY DE WINDT, F.R.G.S., Author of " A Ride to India," etc. With a Map and 
Illustrations. 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, $2.50. 

" Mr. de Windt describes this book as the record of a failure. ... So interesting a record is it that not many recent 
successes in the way of adventurous travel equal it in grim human interest." London Daily Chronicle. 

FARTHEST NORTH. 

By Dr. FRIDTJOF NANSEN. Being the Record of a Voyage of Exploration of the Ship Fram (1893-1896),

" Mr. Colquhoun possesses excellent qualifications, and is in every respect well equipped for the task he has undertaken.

A History of the Presidency. 

** By EDWABD STAKWOOD, LittD. i 



Crown 
8vo, $2.50. 

This work is based on Mr. Stanwood's " History 
of Presidential Elections," which has been regarded 
as a standard authority. Mr. Stan wood has rewrit- 
ten the portion relating to elections prior to 1856, 
greatly modified later chapters, and brought the 
narrative down to and including the election of 
1896. He devotes new chapters to the electoral 
system and the development of the National Con- 
vention ; and his is the only book which narrates 
the inception of all national parties and records 
their authoritative platforms. The work is virtually 
indispensable to colleges, libraries, and all students 
of American political history. 

Human Immortality: 
Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine. 
By WILLIAM JAMES, Professor of Philosophy at 
Harvard University, and author of " Psychology," 
" The Will to Believe," etc. 16mo, $1.00. 

Dr. James considers here two points supposed by 
some persons to militate against the doctrine of 
human immortality, physical death, and the innu- 
merable host of human beings. His treatment of the 
subject is original and of profound interest, and at 
times is not only convincing but nobly eloquent. 

The Starlight Calendar. 

* Compiled by KATE SANBORN, who compiled 
" A Tear of Sunshine " and " The Rainbow Calen- 
dar." 16mo, $1.25. 

To her previous admirable calendars Miss San- 
born adds " The Starlight Calendar," crowning the 
earthly series with a heavenly conclusion. 



The Black Curtain. 

* A Novel. By FLORA HA INKS LOUQHKAD, 
author of "The Man Who Was Guilty," "The 
Abandoned Claim," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

Among the foot-hills not far from San Francisco 
the hero and the heroine, unknown to each other, 
simultaneously take possession of the same section 
of government land. The friendly contest for pos- 
session is admirably described, and the mystery of 
a black curtain in the hero's cottage adds to the zest 
of an uncommonly interesting story. 

The Boys of Old Monmouth. 

* A Story of the American Revolution. By 
EVERETT T. TOMLINSON, author of " Guarding the 
Border," " Washington's Young Aides," etc. With 
illustrations. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

This is another of Mr. Tomlinson's stirring stories 
of Revolutionary days. Two boys have part in 
important scenes, one acting the hero in the battle 
of Monmouth ; and Washington and other famous 
persons figure in the interesting story. 

Tn the Brave Days of Old. 

* A Story of Adventure in the time of King 
James the First. By RUTH HALL. With a front- 
ispiece illustration. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

A book of stirring adventures, for boys. Giles 
Valentine, an English boy, and Jan Verrooy, a 
Dutch boy, together have a hand in many historical 
events in England, Holland, France, and America, 
such as warning of the Gunpowder Plot, sailing with 
Henry Hudson in the Half Moon, etc. The story 
has good historic background, and is told with great 
spirit.

COMMENTS. 



A LITERARY 
ACHIEVEMENT 

OF 
HIGH RANK. 



" In Husch's pages the figure of the famous Chancellor 
rises with lifelike vigor and color and the surroundings 
and historical background are skilfully drawn. Consid- 
ered merely as a biography, the 
specific aim of which is to impress 
indelibly the traits of the subject's 
personality, this diary would con- 
stitute a literary achievement of 
high rank, even if its hero were a purely fictitious char- 
acter, and not the most powerful individuality among the 
great politicians of our century. . . . 
Whether the great German Chan- 
cellor left memoirs is uncertain; he 
began them, but whether he com- 
pleted them is unknown; even if 
such documents exist in manuscript, 
it is extremely doubtful whether 
they will see the light, at least for 
some years to come. Meanwhile we 
have a substitute for them in the 
two capacious volumes published by 
the Macmillan Company. . . . The 
Prince, indeed, may be said to have 
been a collaborateur with Dr. Busch 
in the preparation of the earliest 
manuscript forthe press." TheSun. 

" Dr. Busch is an admirable raconteur, and you get 
from his notes a vivid impression of Bismarck, who was 
the really great man of the last half 
of the present century. That Dr. 
Busch is absolutely fearless and 
writes what he believes to be true relative to Bismarck 
is apparent. It is absolute accuracy Dr. Busch strives 
for." New York Times. 



EMINENTLY 

WORTH 
READING. 



' Altogether, these excep- 
tionally delightful memoirs 
afford a picture of Bismarck 
that can never be rivalled. 
. . . It is not too much to 
say that the political history 
of Germany during this cen- 
tury, and probably also that 
of Europe, cannot now be 
written without it." The 
Herald (Boston). 



ABSOLUTELY 
FEARLESS. 



" We must accept these Memoirs," says the New York 
Tribune, " as at any rate authoritative. In everything 
that relates to the personality of Bismarck he is emi- 
nently worth reading; when he speaks 
only the words that the Chancellor 
pats into his mouth we must give his 
pages high rank. If his Boswellian 
adoration were less in evidence, he would be invaluable. 
As it is, the gigantic figure of Bismarck imposed itself 
upon him with such force that we gain, in spite of the 
indefatigible reporter, a powerful 
impression. . . . He writes like one 
accustomed to deal with political 
events in a vein of free, forcible, and 
popular exposition. He is skilful 
and clever, a great special pleader. 
He is a German, and hence he is 
fond of details, setting them all 
forth with admirable patience. . . . 
He was in the fullest possible sym- 
pathy with the Chancellor." 

" By far the most important con- 
tribution yet made to Bismarck's 
life during this period, and to his 
character, both as a man, as a states- 
man, and as a diplomat. Bismarck 
knew that the author had prepared this diary, and gave 
him full permission to publish it the 
minute he (Bismarck) should be un- 
der ground. It will probably never 
be surpassed as a revelation of the 
character of Prince Bismarck, and 
this makes it especially interesting at the present time."

SPANISH LITERATURE. 

By JAMES Frrz MAURICE-KELLY, Member of the Spanish 
Academy. A new volume in THE LITERATURES OP THE 
WORLD SERIES, edited by EDMUND GOBSE. Uniform with 
" Ancient Greek Literature," " French Literature," "Mod- 
ern English Literature," and " Italian Literature." 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

" The introductory chapter has been written to remind readers that 
the great figures of the silver age Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Qnlntilian 
were Spanish as well as Romans. It further aims at tracing the 
stream of literature from its Roman fount to the channels of the Gothic 
period ; at defining the limits of Arabic and Hebrew influence on BpanUh 
letters ; at refuting the theory which assumes the exUtence of Immemo- 
rial romances, ana at explaining the interaction between Bpaalsh on 
the Me side, and Provencal and French on the other. Spain's litera- 
ture extends over some hundred and fifty years, from the accession of 
Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV. This period has been treated 
as It deserves, at greater length than any other." From the Preface.

F.R.S. In four volumes. Volume I., with thirty-two plates 
and a photogravure portrait. 8vo, cloth, $7.50. (Edition 
limited to one hundred tett.) 

" It was a true insight which led Professors Foster and Ray Lankester, 
the editors of these memoirs, to undertake the work which, begun in 
this large volume of over six hundred pages, is expected to extend to 
four volumes in all. No fitter memorial to Huxley could be imagined, 
no more appropriate attempt to uncover to general view the tread 
foundations upon which hi* claim to fame and reputation must rest in 
the future could be conceived, than to publish in collective form the 
papers which, for wellnigh half a century of scientific activity, he con- 
tributed to scientific societies and scientific periodicals. . . . These 
memoirs have left us with a very decided impression : we have been 
introduced, as It were, afresh to Huxley the specialist, Fellow of the 
Royal Society at twenty-six, its Royal Medallist at twenty-seven, a 
mind-producing work of the first order, a figure which looms large and 
Impressive on the Imagination." London Spectator.

DAVID HARUM. 

A Story of American Life. By EDWARD NOTES WBUTCOTT. 

12mo, oloth, $1.50. 

The author has saturated himself with local atmosphere, and he ha* 
observed the quaint and delightful type presented in his book until he 
ha* been able to offer a picture so vivid, true, and irresistibly humorous 
that we recognise at once the addition of a new figure to the permanent 
gonn studies In American fiction. 

" A novel which promises to attract special attention, not alone for 
its Intrinsic merit, but also on account of the exceptional circumstances 
under which it was written. . . . The central figure, David Harum, is 
an old country banker, dry, quaint, and somewhat illiterate. Some of 
hi* naying> will undoubtedly challenge comparison with those of Mark 
Twain'* ' Pudd'nbead Wilson,' although the resemblance between the 
two books ends there. Take, for Instance, such sayings as this : ' A 
reasonable amount of fleas is good for a dog they keep him f 'm broodin' 
on bein' a dog '; or again, * Do unto the other feller the way he 'd like 
to do unto you an' do it fust. ' We predict an unusual success for this 
volume." New York Commercial Advertiser.

A Romance of 1812. By J. A. ALTSIIKLKK, author of "A

The author's brilliant success in this country and in England as a 
writer of American historical romances will direct especial ttention 
to his new book, which embodies hi* most ambitious work. He open* 
with some most interesting pictures of sodal life and political condition* 
in Washington just before the War of 18TJ, and later the reader gain* 
an Insight into the contemporary life of Philadelphia, New York, and

RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON. 

In a contribution to one of the late issues of 
" Literature," Mr. W. D. Howells discusses the 
Southern literary product of the United States, 
saying of Mr. Harris and Mr. Cable that they 
are " certainly the best known " of our recent 
Southern writers, and supposing " there can be 
no question but they are the first." The task 
of arranging writers according to their rank is 
always invidious and usually unprofitable, but 
in this case the death, a few days ago, of 
Colonel Richard Malcolm Johnston, makes it 
necessary to question the dicta of Mr. Howells, 
and to assert that no list, however narrowly 
restricted, of our foremost Southern writers can 
be accepted if it does not include the name of 
the novelist, scholar, and gentleman, whose 
grievous loss we now mourn. The omission by 
our eccentric critic of Mr. Johnston's name 
may, however, be attributed to a strange mis- 
conception. In the same article, Mr. Howells 
speaks of " a school of Southern humorists be- 
fore the war," and, after describing their work 
as " atrocious," says that he wishes " distinctly 
to except from this censure the ' Dukesborough 
Tales ' and the other sketches by the same au- 
thor, which have a whimsical grace and are 
simple and often sweet, with a satisfying air of 
truth." We infer from this that Mr. Johnston 
is reckoned among the antebellum writers, 
whereas the "Dukesborough Tales" made their 
first collected appearance in 1883, and their 
author had done nothing at all in the way of 
literary production until four or five years pre- 
viously, when the publication of a few tales and 
sketches in the magazines first directed atten- 
tion to his name. 

Mr. Johnston is given a unique position in 
our literature by the fact that he was nearly 
sixty years old before he began to be a writer, 
and that back of his literary period there lies 
nearly a lifetime of activity as a lawyer and a 
professor of literature. He was, then, an ante- 
bellum writer only in the sense that his fiction 
dealt almost exclusively with a period long 
ante-dating the Civil War, and restored for a 
new generation a past that had vanished from 
the memory of most living men. The period 
was that of the thirties and forties, and the 



214 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1. 



place Middle Georgia, a time and a region of 
which the " form and pressure " are preserved 
to us in Mr. Johnston's books with a faith- 
fulness of delineation and a geniality of con- 
ception barely equalled and certainly unsur- 
passed by the best of the younger school of 
" local " writers whose work forms so import- 
ant a part of recent imaginative literature in 
this count ry.' 

The Middle Georgia of the novelist's youth 
and early manhood is made so interesting a 
subject for our contemplation that a few quo- 
tations from him, in his character as historian 
of his native section rather than as story-teller, 
may fittingly be reproduced upon this occasion. 
In a paper written only three years ago to be 
read before the Twentieth Century Club of 
Chicago, Mr. Johnston said : 

" If ever there was a man who felt himself to be ab- 
solutely a freeman, it was the rustic of Middle Georgia. 
. . . The poorest white man had no apprehension of 
falling into the lower scale, and so his ambitions were 
the freer and the more cheerful to lift himself higher. 
... In my own immediate neighborhood, some seventy- 
five miles west, not one grown man in five had ever 
been to Augusta, then a town of some six thousand. 
. . . Sometimes in an argument between two rural per- 
sons one, who might be on the verge of defeat, if by 
some sort of chance, not enjoyed by his adversary, he 
had been to Augusta, might look upon him with such con- 
tempt as was possible to feel, and say: ' Now look here, 
John, has yon ever been to Augusty? ' On the sad ac- 
knowledgement in the negative, he might add : * Well, 
then, do n't try to talk to me about sech matters, because 
they is matters as can 't be complete understood except by 
them as has been to Augusty.' ... To one who remem- 
bers the conditions and incidents of such a society it seems 
difficult to overpraise its neighborliness, the healthful- 
ness, the confidence, the warm affectionateness which 
except among mean people, and mean people are in every 
community generally obtained. None were very rich 
and none very poor, but rich and poor, especially among 
men, intermingled with the freedom of intercourse that 
was productive of results most beneficial to all. . . . 
Aristotle taught that leaders in societies should think 
like wise men, but talk like the common people. That 
was just what was done by leading citizens of Georgia 
three-quarters of a century ago. . . . The noble Georgia 
dialect savored in much affectionate sweetness. Much 
of it, as I have been told in letters from eminent phil- 
ologists, is a relic of English as spoken three and four 
centuries ago. . . . The greatest lawyers and politicians 
and even divines loved it to the degree that they habit- 
ually spoke it, if not at home before their wives and 
children, at least in social intercourse among their 
neighbors." 

Such was the almost idyllic social life, and 
such the dialect, of the people who live for us 
in Mr. Johnston's fiction. No phase of local 
American society has received more faithful 
and loving depiction anywhere in our literature, 
and the peculiar value of Mr. Johnston's stories 



is in their application to a comparatively early 
period of the realistic methods of recent liter- 
ary art. The older writers neglected their 
opportunity, or did not know how to make 
effective use of it, but the facts were recorded 
upon the sensitive plate of Mr. Johnston's 
memory and given fresh vitality in the alembic 
of his genius. There is dialect in profusion in 
his books, but it gives no offence, for we easily 
distinguish it from the spurious effusions of 
dialect that have caused an eruption in our fic- 
tion of recent years. It is the genuine thing, 
the inevitable garment of the thought which it 
clothes ; it is not adventitious, written for a 
wanton satisfaction in the misspelling of words. 
It is, moreover, carefully studied and conscien- 
tiously reproduced, combining the scholar's 
instinct for exact truth with the artist's instinct 
for effective expression. 

The following list includes the more import- 
ant of Mr. Johnston's works of fiction : " Dukes- 
borough Tales," " Old Mark Langston," " Two 
Gray Tourists," " Mr. Absalom Billingslea," 
" Ogeechee Cross-Firings," " Widow Guthrie," 
" Old Times in Middle Georgia," " The Primes 
and Their Neighbors," " Mr. Billy Downs and 
His Likes," and "Pearce Amerson's Will." 
Of these works, " Widow Guthrie " is the long- 
est and the most serious, but the peculiar gifts 
of the author appear to better advantage when 
he works within narrower limits, and one is 
apt to recall most vividly some of the " Dukes- 
borough Tales " or some of the sketches con- 
tained in " Old Times in Middle Georgia." In 
addition to his fiction, he published a life of 
Alexander H. Stevens (in collaboration with 
Mr. W. H. Browne), and two volumes of 
"Studies, Literary and Social." The latter 
volumes are excellent reading, and deserve a 
high rank among books of essays, although it 
takes some effort so to readjust the mental 
focus as to think of the author's discoursing 
seriously upon such subjects as " Belisarius," 
or " American Philosophy," or " The Minne- 
singer and Meistersinger," or " Shakespeare's 
Tragic Lovers." 

Richard Malcolm Johnston was born in 
1822, on a plantation in Middle Georgia. 
When a boy he removed with his family to 
Powell ton (the Dukesborough of the tales). 
He studied at Mercer University, Macon, and 
fitted for the bar. A law partnership with 
Ltnton Stephens, a younger brother of Alex- 
ander H. Stephens, lasted for about ten years, 
when he became a professor in the University 
of Georgia, at Athens. From this time on, his

occupations were teaching, lecturing, and writ- 
ing. In middle life he became a member of 
the Koman Catholic Church. Married at an 
early age, his domestic life was singularly 
happy, and the death, a little over a year ago, 
of the woman who had been the devoted part- 
ner of his joys and sorrows for over fifty years 
left him, to take his own pathetic words from 
a letter to a friend " poor indeed and lowly 
prostrate." But he added: "Yet I feel no 
diminution of willingness to do the work of the 
remainder of my time, and hope for continuance 
of the strength necessary for it." A year after 
these words were written he lay dying in the 
hospital at Baltimore, the city with which he 
had been identified during the latter period of 
his life. On the 23d of September he breathed 
his last, bequeathing to American literature a 
body of work that will not soon be forgotten, 
and to those who enjoyed the privilege of his 
friendship the memory of a fine spirit, gentle in 
the truest sense of the term, the soul of cor- 
diality, courtliness, and chivalry. He was dear 
to all who knew him, and will be remembered 
as we remember only those for whom our affec- 
tion is the deepest. 



INSPIRATION. 

Mrs. Browning wrote a sonnet on " The Inex- 
pressible," and was fond of intimating that she had 
something to say that could not be put into words. 
I do not believe " insufficient utterance " is charac- 
teristic of any good writer. On the contrary, words 
very often mean more than their author intended. 
I can imagine Shakespeare reading something he 
had written over-night and wondering how in the 
world he came to do anything so good. George 
Eliot says somewhere that a young girl's beauty has 
a meaning and significance of which the young girl 
herself is not aware. Similarly, combinations of 
felicitous words and rhythms have implications and 
perspectives and pregnancies which could not all 
have occurred to their writer during the brief mo- 
ment of composition. The mortal has brought forth 
immortality, has given birth to something which is 
approximately perfect and imperishable. Whence 
comes this gift, this lucky inheritance of an estate 
outside the blood ? I know not what to attribute it 
to but inspiration. 

There are writers who go about to reduce expres- 
sion to an exact science, who believe we can arrive 
at verbal perfection by laborious toil. They hunt 
through dictionaries and obsolete books, and track 
the shy, wild animal, the mot propre, to its secret 
lair. And some of them, Flaubert and Stevenson 
for instance, spend half their days in confiding to 



their friends the horrors and dangers of the chase 

the difficulties incurred in acquiring a good prose 
style. The older writers who used words reason- 
ably well Pascal or Swift or Goldsmith, for ex- 
ample never seem to have had so hard a time. 
There is a fashion in these things. In Sheridan's 
days it was the proper pose for an author to dash 
off the brilliant act of a comedy in one night over 
a bottle of claret. Now the genesis of every word 
must he established, and the public made a witness 
of the parturition of every sentence. The facts were 
probably always the same. Skill and labor were 
required to cut and pile the faggots for literary bon- 
fires, hut the sparks which lit them had to fall from 
above. Lacking any magnetic connection with the 
source of fire, the beacons would fail to burn. 

As for the mot propre, it is surely as fabulous a 
wild fowl as the phoanix or the roc. With the ex- 
ception of a few words which accommodate the 
sound to the sense, there is no natural or logical 
connection between language and life. The former 
is purely arbitrary, and to suppose that for every 
fact of nature or experience there stands ready a 
sole and unique verbal mate like the ticket num- 
ber, and the prize in a lottery drawing is a wild 
fancy. Besides, the facts of existence are, after all, 
limited in number; while the combinations and 
views and opinions of them in the minds of men are 
inexhaustible. One cause of style is individuality 

the affixing of a different label to a fact from that 
which any other human being would attach to it. 
No two writers make the same report of a subject. 
The songs of Burns and Shelley have largely the 
same theme; but in rhythm, vocabulary, quality, 
timbre, they are as the antipodes. Like the monads 
of Leibnitz, poets are sent into the world with vary- 
ing velocities, and each one attracts words to him- 
self in a different fashion from his fellows. 

Eight virgins were used as models by an ancient 
sculptor for a single statue. This fact seems de- 
rogatory to the charms of the young women. But 
where did the sculptor get the standard which au- 
thorized him to reject their parts of being ? Where 
did Pheidias get his conception of the Olympian 
Zeus ? What is the reason that the Parthenon or 
the Taj Mahal are superior to the ordinary City 
Hall or Post Office Building ? Why are the great 
figures of fiction so universal that living men and 
women seem merely bad imitations of such crea- 
tions so that we speak of people whom we know as 
Quixotic or Pecksniffian ? There is something more 
than a mere imitation of life implied in arts that 
can give laws to life. But this ideal element, where 
does it come from? The modern theory would be 
that it is merely a selection of the best of the real. 
But leaving out of question how we are to recognize 
the best, the fact remains that this ideal element is 
strongest in the infancy of art, before the races 
amid which it rises have developed their character 
or worked out their destiny. Homer was the school- 
master of Greece ; and we probably cannot measure 
how much Shakespeare has affected English char-

acter. There seems to be a matter of " pare antici- 
pated cognition " in the case. The artist does some- 
thing, unknowing how, which can stand up against 
the world and draw the world to it. 

We are driven to the Platonic Ideas for an ex- 
planation. It would really appear as if the arch y- 
typal forms, of which the images and appearances 
of the world are merely mutilated copies, do appear 
to the artist in certain heated conditions of his mind, 
and translate themselves through him into adequate 
language or other art media. And not only the 
beautiful and good, but the evil as well. Plato 
himself, in one of his dialogues, comes to this point, 
and, with that urbane open-mindedness which is his 
great charm, seems to think it a check to his theory. 
The ideal bad smell, for instance, which must be 
accepted if his theory is carried out in full, is some- 
thing he cannot stomach. But if the created figures 
of the artist which make for good are superior to 
ordinary men and women, so are his projections of 
evil more portentous than anything in real life. 
People of opprobrious repute cluster about him to 
have their portraits painted or their figure sculp- 
tured ; but the artist looks them over and says, " My 
dear fellows, you are well enough as far as you go. 
But you are not the best expression of your own 
tendencies. You are minor. The dross of little- 
ness and incompetency encumbers you." And then 
he turns to the vision of the proper Platonic Idea, 
and forges out the pure gold of an lago or a Mephis- 
topheles. 

The work of the poet is always, therefore, a 
revelation, and each poet brings anew one. Noth- 
ing is more remarkable than the way the presum- 
ably fixed facts of human nature shift and alter 
under the various colored lights poured upon them 
by the poets. Chaucer will give us mankind rosy 
and solid, shaking the earth with its tread, robust 
in vice and virtue. Shakespeare will transmute 
the same people to beings of air and fire, irradiate 
as a sunset dream. Dickens will give them to us 
as a grimy, grotesque, touchingly human mob 
the procession of Shakespeare after having gone 
through a coal-hole. Yet each aspect will be true. 
The highest revelation which the poet can give is 
probably concerned with the goodness of beauty, 
whereas the highest revelation of the prophet is in 
regard to the beauty of goodness. The two roles, 
however, are hardly distinguishable, and to forbid 
the poet the use of ethical motives is simply to cut 
off one of his wings. True, the province of litera- 
ture is to delight But to delight whom ? To the 
Covenanter, sleeping in caves and meeting, at the 
risk of his life, to worship the ideas of duty and 
God were the most delightful imaginable. Indeed, 
beauty, grace, and charm the qualities usually 
appropriated to poetry are in a measure luxuries. 
We can hustle through life without them. But 
duties and morals are necessities, the plain bread of 
everyday life. And they are the main stuff out of 
which literature is built 

Matthew Arnold was the rare instance of a great 



critic and admirable poet who was incapable of 
philosophy. Speaking of Wordsworth's " Intima- 
tions of Immortality from the Recollections of 
Childhood," he says that the central idea is a pleas- 
ing play of fancy of no solid value. To dismiss as 
valueless an idea which is seriously mooted in more 
than one great system of philosophy, and which, in 
the form of reincarnation, is the basic principle of 
Hindoo thought, is, to say the least, confident dog- 
matism. It is a fact that children do exhibit some- 
thing like inspiration. The awakening of the intel- 
lect in childhood is in itself one of the great miracles 
of life, and at no other stage of existence is the pure 
play of thought so vivid or the happiness which 
comes from knowing and imagining so great. Every- 
one has noted the genius-like characteristics of child- 
hood, and, conversely, the child-like nature of the 
mature genius. The latter, like the child, concen- 
trates himself on his game of imagination, and is 
more or less irresponsible in the outward relations 
of life. The child is protected in his beautiful 
dreams until they naturally fade from him ; but the 
world is at war with the genius, because it does not 
like to have its wretched result of failure brought in 
comparison with his easily perfect work of imagina- 
tion. Why do we teach children absolute truthful- 
ness, high-mindedness, and unselfishness, when we 
know that such qualities are the worst possible ones 
to fit them for the struggle of life? 

The intuitional and inspirational character of 
woman relates her even more closely with the pure 
world of ideas than childhood. Woman's character 
is more intense and simple in both extremes than 
man's. So far as we have got in the history of the 
world, her share of genius itself has not amounted to 
anything very great. But man has always seemed 
to regard her as an intermediary between the world 
of pure ideas and himself, if she be not those 
pure ideas in proper person. He has always evinced 
a touching willingness to be inspired or damned by 
her. Certainly in literature she has been the one 
inspirational force, beating Nature or Patriotism, 
or even Religion, outright 

There remains to touch on the subject of frenzy 
as connected with inspiration. The Indians think 
a madman inspired ; but it does not follow that 
genius is mad. Mankind is always in danger of 
falling into a lumpish, inanimate, indistinguishable 
mass. Genius has the office which the repulsive 
force in Nature electricity, magnetic ether, what- 
ever it may be has in its struggle with gravita- 
tion. The poor, lumpish human atoms hate to be 
hounded to their task kept in tune, kept drilled 
and serviceable, and they think it madness that 
genius should take upon itself such employment 
It would be interesting to have those people who 
are clamoring about the madness of genius define 
and draw us a type of what they consider a sane 
and normal human being. It would neceiwarily be 
a thing of negations a thing cold, selfish, and 
dull ; for the least touch of enthusiasm, the least 
lift of spirit, the least devotion to an idea, the least

heroism or unselfishness, must at once raise the sus- 
picion of abnormality, of madness, of genius. What 
Lincoln said of Grant's drunkenness is applicable in 
the case. If genius is mad, it would be well if we 
were all innoculated with a little of the virus. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, Sept. 18, 1898. 

There has just been published, in three volumes, the 
great work by Dr. Moritz Busch on " Bismarck " and 
the secret history which his career furnishes. No doubt 
you will hear plenty of it on your side of the water, so 
that I need not trouble you with any remarks. We are, 
however, very anxious to learn what it is that Dr. Busch 
has to say which has already not been known. " Once 
I am dead," said the late Chancellor to his biographer, 
"you can tell absolutely everything you know about 
me." It is for this " absolutely everything " that we are 
waiting. 

I am much concerned about a branch of the publish- 
ing business with which few people seem ever to have 
troubled themselves. I mean the publication of " art 
books," so called. Has it ever struck you that the mod- 
ern English art-book is a terrible falling-off from those 
we associate with the names of Ackermann, Boydell, 
Major, Virtue, and the rest? And yet our facilities for 
making beautiful books are far more ready and numer- 
ous than those at the service of our grandfathers. If 
one asks a publisher now-a-days why he does n't produce 
a really fine book, he tells one that the expense is too 
great. And yet the expense of such books as Rogers's 
"Italy," the "Stafford Gallery," the "Boydell Shake- 
speare," the great tomes on Oxford and Cambridge which 
Ackermann issued with colored lithographs, the string 
of books by " Froggy " Dibdin, the famous " Walton " 
of Pickering, the expense on these, I say, must have 
been enormous, far greater than the cost of any of our 
modern works, excepting, perhaps, such a catalogue as 
that of the Spitzer Collection. There must have been 
buyers for such books in the "twenties," "thirties," 
"forties," and "fifties": surely there would be found 
buyers for the excellent productions of the " nineties " ! 
But where are they ? I am afraid they are not even with 
Hans Breitmann's "barty," in "de lofely clouds"; for 
they never had an existence. For these fine old illustrated 
books there are, to-day, hundreds of eager collectors. 
Who ever dreams now of treasuring bound pages of 
half-tone blocks or dirty reproductions of wash draw- 
ings ? And rightly, too, say I. The modern art-book, 
where it is found, proves to be nothing more nor less 
than a fattened and extended sixpenny magazine. All 
that a publisher who seeks distinction in this branch of 
his business needs to do is simply to get a wretched 
hack to scrawl off some wretcheder text on any special 
subject, and print this stuff on fine thick paper. With 
this for an excuse, he pads the rest with sheets of pro- 
cess reproductions, flashes a gilt binding with a deco- 
rative ( !) design, forsooth, and your " art-book " is made. 
A fig, say I, for such " art-books." A year or two ago 
there was issued a great work on Velasquez, or Van- 
dyke, I forget which; but compare it with what was once 
done for Gainsborough, Morland, Constable, and others. 
The modern book is not a patch on the older ones. We 
confess this when we pay as much for one print torn 



out of a collection of the engravings of Reynolds's pic- 
tures as we do for a dozen complete copies of examples 
from Leighton or Burne-Jones. The truth is that mod- 
ern process work does not make for art as did the old 
process. I had rather even have a collection of repro- 
ductions of line drawings than I would a whole gallery 
choked with the photographer-tampered work of " toned" 
and " gravured " stuff called " art." In the line draw- 
ing, I do at least get the artist's work. The deuce alone 
knows what the " process " maker does to get his effects 
in the other work. And yet good " art-books " may be 
made as well to-day as ever they were. But I am not 
writing to give advice to publishers. I simply record 
a fact worth making a note of. It is possible that what 
I have said may be especially timely for Mr. Harry 
Quilter, who, I hear, is about to turn publisher in the 
art line. He may know a great deal about art, but un- 
less he knows how to publish it, it will go hard with his 
business. I wish him every success, he may turn out 
to be the right man. 

Publishers, it seems to me, take about as much time 
to find their particular metier as do other mortals. Car- 
lyle, I think it was, said that a man spends forty years 
of his life trying to find out the work for which he was 
best fitted. Publishers, on the other hand, spend forty 
thousand pounds doing the same thing, and fail in the 
end. Now, if I wished to turn publisher, which the 
Fates forfend, and I had the money wherewithal to 
indulge my whim, I 'd cultivate my whim, and run it 
for all it was worth. At any rate, I 'd have a run for 
my money. The professional publisher, however, does 
nothing of the kind. He runs other people's whims, 
not knowing what the deuce will come of it; and winds 
up surprised to find that they swallowed up all his capital 
without giving him any return. If he can 't find any 
whims, he steals other publishers' clients, pays more 
money to them, and balances on the wrong side of 
his ledger. Hence, ruinous competition, and the many 
Jeremiahs filling our ears with noisome waitings of bad 
times. 

I have hardly left myself any space to tell you of 
news. Not that there is much; still, I must not omit to 
inform you of the forthcoming publication of Mr. Rus- 
kin's letters to Rossetti, between the years 1852 and 
1862. The book which will contain them will be pub- 
lished here by Mr. George Allen, and is to be a sort of 
history of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Mr. J. M. 
Barrie and the Rev. " Ian Maclaren " have each a novel 
nearly ready; they will be issued late in the autumn or 
early in the spring. A very important work on the 
Post Office is being prepared by Mr. Henniker Heaton, 
M.P., but this will not be ready for some months to 
come. Our bards are also busy, and we are to have 
volumes of poems from Mr. William Watson, Mr. John 
Davidson, and one or two others. Just now books of 
travel are having a vogue, and attention is divided be- 
tween Lhassa and Chitral. When Sir Martin Conway 
returns from his South American climbings, we are to 
have an account of his successful ascents of Ylliuiani 
and Ylliampa. Mr. George Moore is passing through 
the press his sequel to " Evelyn Innes," and Mr. Robert 
Buchanan his volume of " Reminiscences." Mr. Bu- 
chanan also has a work " on the stocks " dealing with 
Christianity and the trend of modern religious move- 
ments. Mr. Herbert Spencer is quietly revising old 
editions of his " Synthetic Philosophy," and he has almost 
finished the " Principles of Biology."

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

CONCERNING VERSE OF THE LATE WAR. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL, i 

When an anthology of the verse of the late war comes 
to be prepared, it will be found that it is also an anthol- 
ogy of international love, BO far as Great Britain and 
the United States are concerned. And it will not con- 
tain many examples of verse of any kind, if its purpose 
be a literary one; if, on the other band, the work be 
intended for popular use, it will have thousands. I have 
in my possession some hundreds of newspaper clippings, 
each holding a " poem " related with more or less inti- 
macy to the Hispano- American conflict. Many of them 
fall under the distinctly American class of " funny," 
which almost invariably means a source of real grief to 
the judicious. The most famous of these is probably 
Mr. John Kendrick Bangs's amusing " Change of Am- 
bitions," ending: 

" The grammar ' bad ; but oh, my son, 
I wiah I M did what Dewey done t " 

Of the more serious, many are in dialect, notably the 
" Together " of Mr. Frank Stanton, which has had the 
greatest newspaper vogue, and rightly, since he sings of 
the real union which this war has effected between the 
North and South. 

Before the outbreak of hostilities there was little to 
be found in English or American verse respecting Cuba. 
Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, Mr. Frank Putnam, and 
Mr. Charles H. Crandall had published books, that of the 
first-named having also a glowing poem on Anglo-Saxon 
union which did not gain the attention it deserved ; while 
Miss Caroline Duer, Miss Edith M. Thomas, and, later, 
Mr. Lucien V. Rule, have sent out booklets celebrating 
England as well as America. Many more will follow, 
probably of a more popular and less literary type, like 
the " Songs of War and Peace " from the facile pen of 
Mr. Sam Walter Foss. 

But the actual poetry of the day, the verse contained 
in these clippings of mine, to be taken as typical of the 
whole, is at two extremes. There is simply nothing 
whatever to combine literary quality with proper popu- 
larity in the manner of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe's " Bat- 
tle Hymn of the Republic." There is nothing by way 
of narrative to rank with Henry Howard Brownell's 
River Fight " or " Bay Fight " of our Civil War, 
though the victories of Dewey and Schley need cele- 
bration. There is no single poet who comes from the 
war period with a reputation greatly enhanced, as Mr. 
Edmund Clarence Stedman's was enhanced in the 'six- 
ties. But there is some really admirable workmanship, 
technically very high, as in the two poems published by 
Mr. Clinton Scollard, and two, an ode and a qnatorzain, 
by Mr. Richard Hovey, equal to anything from the 
Civil War in manner, with two by Mr. Thomas Nelson 
Page and one by Miss Thomas. Mr. Joaquin Miller 
has also been heard from. There are some others, 
chiefly women, Miss Madeline S. Bridges and Mrs. 
Margaret E. Sangster among them, who have succeeded 
in giving their product something more than catchiness 
and sentimentality; but they are few. Mr. Alfred 
Austin heard "A Voice from the West," and Mr. Richard 
Mansfield answered it most successfully, making the 
punishment really fit the crime. Mr. Rudyard Kipling 
kept still, as he always does when given his choice be- 
tween silence and saying something pleasant about the 
United States. But Mr. James Barnes has caught the 



Kipling manner quite as successfully as Mr. Owen Sea- 
man; though Mr. Seaman published his " Rhyme of the 
Kipperling " as parody, and Mr. Barnes takes his " Songs 
of the Ships of Steel " very seriously indeed. 

Now these, either through merit or pretence, are at 
one end of the literary ladder. All the rest, the " real 
thing," the " hot stuff," whether it has to do with glo- 
rious victory or the horrors of war, is generally to be 
included in what Mr. Arlo Bates so happily termed 
the chewing-gum school of verse " though, to do him 
justice, he apologized for the phrase, however vulgarly 
necessary. England and Canada had a multitude of 
examples of the same genre in their papers, but they 
were of better design and much better execution, even 
to the verses in cockney dialect in the " London Chron- 
icle," which suggested that evil communications might 
there have broken through. 

The songs that celebrate the rapprochement of Brit- 
annia and Columbia are better than those which have to 
do with America alone, by a great deal. Mr. Edward 
McQueen Gray's " Vision of Reconcilement," Mr. Wal- 
ter Malone's sonnet to this end in " Leslie's Weekly," 
and the poem of Mr. Barrett Eastman which was praised 
in a recent number of THE DIAL, together with many 
another which space does not permit to mention, .-ill 
show qualities of which we may very well be proud. 
Contrasted with those called out by purely national 
circumstances, and intended solely for domestic con- 
sumption, there is a whole heaven of differences. The 
inference is inevitable: England and Canada will not 
print rubbish, even if it is written for their periodicals ; 
but America wants it bad, very bad, and plenty of it, 
it is unnecessary to add that wanting it stands in an 
adverse ratio to needing it.

THE WOMAN FACTOR IN CHINESE 

GOVERNMENT. 
(To the Editor of THB Dm*) 

Now that speculation is rife as to the cause and prob- 
able consequences of the recent stepping aside of the 
Emperor of China in favor of the Empress-Dowager, 
the following characterization of the lady in Mr. Colqu- 
houn's " China in Transformation " (reviewed in THE 
DIAL of Sept. 16) is of peculiar interest. Mr. Colqu- 
houn is the best English authority on the points in ques- 
tion. He says (p. 191): 

"The woman factor is a potent one in Chinese government, 
but never in a worthy sense. . . . How much the present 
collapse of China may be due to the personal qualities of the 
real but illegitimate ruler, the Empress- Dowager, may not be 
known ; but there seems to be no doubt that every surrender 
made to foreigner* since she held the reins was dictated by 
her and her personal convenience. ... A threat of the inva- 
sion of Peking if believed in has always been sufficient to 
bring her to terms. When the present Emperor waa prepared 
to abandon the capital during the Japanese War and resist to 
the bitter end, it waa that imperious lady who insisted on 
peace at any price ; and it is chiefly on her sensitive feelings 
that Russian threats take effect, and deprive the Sovereign of 
the will and the power to resist their demands." 

If such be the case, it seems clear that the statements 
of the Chinese representative at Washington, to the 
effect that the Empress-Dowager's accession to power 
means a general bracing-up of China as against foreign 
encroachments, must be taken cum grano. ,

MR. FORBES'S NAPOLEOX THE THIRD.* 

Mr. Archibald Forbes's new Life of Na- 
poleon the Third is a popularly written book, 
well adapted to the wants and tastes of the 
average reader. The chequered career of Hor- 
tense's scheming son is told in a plain way ; 
without parade of sentiment or show of pro- 
fundity. The author takes a sensible view of 
his rather tawdry hero, and his estimate of him, 
while we think it in general too lenient, is 
impartial and rational in the main. The mis- 
fortunes of the man of Sedan have naturally 
made the world disposed to condone or pass 
over lightly the iniquities of the man of the 
Coup cVEtat ; and much has been written of 
late tending to show Louis Napoleon in a favor- 
able light. It has been pointed out, with truth, 
that he was an amiable and a passably respect- 
able man in private life ; that he was a fairly 
faithful husband, as French husbands of his 
rank and opportunities go ; that he did won- 
ders in the way of renovating and beautifying 
Paris ; that he evinced, in the intervals between 
his chronic enterprises for shoring up his pre- 
cious " dynasty," a decent (and politic) regard 
for the higher welfare of the nation. But when, 
that is said, the truth remains that impartial 
history shows Louis Napoleon to have been 
essentially a plotting, restless, mystifying self- 
seeker, who, to gain his personal ends, did not 
scruple to trample the rights of humanity under 
foot and shed its blood like ditch-water. When 
he destroyed the Second Republic he was asked 
if he should not find it difficult to rule France : 
" Oh, no ! " he replied, " nothing is easier. H 
leurfaut une guerre tons les quatre a/is." That 
was his theory of governing France, and he acted 
up to the spirit of it. Thousands of lives were 
taken and tens of thousands of lives made deso- 
late during the Imperial regime in order that 
this paltry adventurer might keep the throne he 
had stolen. He was only dwarfed by the great 
name he bore. He was as wax in the hands 
of men like Cavour and Bismarck, who quickly 
saw through the flimsy veil of his Delphic 
affectations. There was always a touch of 
the impostor about him, and the bitter gibes of 
Rochefort in " Figaro " and the " Lanterne " 
provoked inextinguishable laughter because 
they hit a palpable mark. His early gipsying

left a taint of low Bohemianism in his ways 
and tastes, which the fastidious Prince Consort 
of England did not fail to note during the 
imperial visit at Windsor. There was, Prince 
Albert thought, a certain " flavor of the canteen 
and the barrack hanging about the Emperor 
and his suit." 

Louis Napoleon was a morbidly selfish man 
who would sacrifice anything or anyone to gain 
a political end : witness his base desertion of 
Maximilian. He could hazard the life of his 
own flesh and blood to win some paltry scrap 
of political eclat. When he left Paris in 1870, 
to join his army on the frontier, he took with 
him the young Prince Imperial in order that 
the ill-starred lad might undergo his " baptism 
of fire," or, in plain terms, might be shot at by 
the Germans, a cheap and cruel piece of 
theatricality in which the Empress joined. 

Napoleon the Little was a mean and crafty 
fisher in troubled waters. He exploited his 
neighbors' necessities through arts worthy of 
Chatham Street. When they were at war he 
went between them, plying " his policy oipour- 
boires, as Bismarck called it, and seeking to 
extort from the embarrassments of one or other 
of them a scrap of territory or other douceur in 
return for his favor or neutrality,. At this 
small diplomatic game he was easily beaten by 
the big Prussian, who, in 1866, did not hesi- 
tate to cajole him with the prospect of a hand- 
some " tip " which he had no intention of 
bestowing in the end. In sum, the most re- 
spectable thing about Louis Napoleon was, to 
our thinking, his dignified bearing in the hour 
of misfortune, when all was irretrievably lost 
and the shadow of death was upon him. A 
Prince, says Machiavelli, should combine the 
qualities of the lion and the fox. The vulpine 
qualities Louis Napoleon certainly possessed in 
no small measure ; but there was nothing at all 
about him of the lion save (in his palmy 
days) the skin. 

Mr. Forbes's estimate of Napoleon III. is 
somewhat higher than ours, and may very pos- 
sibly be truer. It is, at all events, not an ex- 
alted one. Mr. Forbes, it must be added, con- 
fines himself mainly to direct narration of 
events, the passages wherefrom his own opin- 
ions of his hero's character and methods are to 
be gathered being in the main impliedly ap- 
proved quotations from Jerrold, Kinglake, 
Fraser, Louis Blanc, etc. In fact, this lack of 
critical venturesomeness may prove a little 
disappointing to the class of readers who like 
to get their opinions no less than their facts

from their author. Bat Mr. Forbes's book is 
by no means superficial. While its style is rapid 
its touch is sure, and it evinces a clear insight 
into the intricate politics of the period. The 
accounts of the Coup cTEtat, of the Crimean 
War, of the wretched Mexican business, and of 
the preliminaries of the German-French War, 
while they are very concise, are pithy and to 
the point. Mr. Forbes's explanation of Napo- 
leon's fatal delay in 1870 in perfecting the 
treaty with Austria and Italy, the preliminaries 
of which, as is now known, had been arranged 
just before Bismarck gave a timely fillip to 
hostilities he saw were inevitable, is interest- 
ing. General Lebrun's Memoirs prove con- 
clusively that a coalition against Germany had 
actually been formed, and that in case of its 
success Italy was to get Rome, Austria was to 
have restored to her Silesia, while France was 
to receive Belgium and the left bank of the 
Rhine. The treaty was drawn up, and awaited 
only the signatures of the Three Powers ; but 
it was not signed when the war broke out in 
July. Prince Jerome has told us that the chief 
cause of Napoleon's hesitation in the matter 
was the intense feeling manifested by the Cler- 
ical Party in France against handing over 
Rome to the lay power in Italy. Prince Jerome's 
explanation is the commonly accepted one. 
Mr. Forbes offers another theory. The diffi- 
culty about Rome was not, he thinks, the chief 
reason why the treaty that might have saved 
Napoleon his throne was not ratified. 

41 The Emperor Napoleon had calculated he was no 
strategist that by rapidity of concentration he might 
gain some advantage over Germany and perhaps even 
win an important battle. If so, he would offer peace to 
the King of Prussia on terms of alliance against En- 
gland, assistance for the conquest of Belgium, and the 
cession to France of the left bank of the Rhine; Prussia 
in return to receive a perfectly free hand in Germany. 
The governing idea of the Emperor was the formation 
of a strong alliance against England. This is proved in 
actual documents; and the diary of the Emperor Fred- 
erick II. shows that Napoleon did not abandon it even 
after Sedan. One might commiserate his downfall even 
if he had been an unscrupulous man ; but to be plotting 
coolly against the nation in which he had found cordial 
sympathy, friendship, and a free asylum, was a baseness 
from which the most cynical of men might recoil." 

Mr. Forbes's style is easy and animated, if 
a little slipshod at times. His book is by all 
odds the best popular life of Napoleon III., in 
that it is the most solidly instructive one on its 
historical side and the least misleading one on 
its biographical. The volume is a comely one, 
containing many portraits. Unfortunately, it 
lacks an index.

THE L.AW8 AND THE LIFE OP A PEOPLE.* 

The influence of the comparatively recent 
interest in the study of political science, as dif- 
ferentiated from that of history, is illustrated 
by the two handsomely printed volumes, en- 
titled A Constitutional History of the Amer- 
ican People," which have just appeared from 
the work-room of Mr. Francis Newton Thorpe. 
An examination of a vast amount of material 
in the form of state constitutions, legislative 
enactments, and treaties and conventions, has 
been made to show the truth of a suggestion of 
Emerson in his " Essay on Politics ": 

" The form of government which prevails is the ex- 
pression of what cultivation exists in the population 
which permits it. ... The history of the State sketches 
in coarse outline the progress of thought and follows at 
a distance the delicacy of culture and aspiration." 

In the constitution of Massachusetts of 1780, 
the state is declared to be a contract, that the 
government " may be a government of laws, 
and not of men." William Penn conceived of 
the state as a compact, but the government was 
to be " a government of men, and not of laws." 
The evolution of these two ideas is taken as the 
history of American politics, and the history of 
Democracy in America is the record of the 
contest between laws a conventional system 
of politics and men struggling for industrial 
freedom. The conditions prevailing in 1776 
are essentially different from those of 1850. 
Environment, racial and social relations, the 
expansion of territory, the movements of pop- 
ulation, all have important bearing upon the 
development of ideas of government, as the 
problems connected with the closely intertwined 
and often opposing interests of state and na- 
tional sovereignty are worked out in America. 
The expressions of the popular mind are the 
state constitutions and legislative enactments ; 
in careful examination and comparison of these 
expressions one is enabled to trace the efforts 
of the people to secure desired ends ; and it is 
these efforts which make up constitutional his- 
tory, because a constitutional history deals pri- 
marily with persons and not with documents. 

This seems to be the thesis which is expanded 
by Mr. Thorpe. The study divides itself into 
several pretty clearly defined parts. One con- 
sists of lectures of a more or less philosophical 
nature, which treat abstract propositions about 
government. Another is a comparative study 
of state constitutions at various periods down

to 1850. A third comprises an examination 
of selected typical constituencies, found in 
Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Califor- 
nia, which constituencies are believed to illus- 
trate the phases of civil evolution in the North, 
in the South, in the Border States, and in the 
Far West. Certain essays on special themes, 
which, while interesting, do not seem to fit into 
the general scheme, are interpolated, and the 
result is "A Constitutional History of the 
American People." 

There must be decided difference of opinion 
as to the title. Is this a constitutional history 
of the "American people " ? Somewhere the 
author uses the words " States-united " in con- 
tradistinction to " United States," and the ex- 
amination and comparison of state constitutions 
and legislative enactments which he has made 
suggests " A Constitutional History of States- 
United " as a preferable title instead of the 
ambitious one used by him. 

Those portions of the work which compare 
and contrast state constitutions are both inter- 
esting and valuable. Popular ideas are shown 
as reflected in the state papers prepared by 
constitutional conventions, and the growth of 
Democracy is well indicated by the same doc- 
uments. The various tables which show the 
changing qualifications of governor, senator, 
representative, elector, make a suggestive study. 
A large mass of material was sifted in the pre- 
paration of these chapters, and the results seem 
satisfactory. A just criticism could not be made 
except by one who had had the same advan- 
tages of material and had given the same pains- 
taking care to the investigation. 

Specific criticism can be made, however, of 
the other parts of the history. The arguments 
of a philosophical nature make difficult reading. 
The sentences are labored, and are too concise 
to be easily followed. There are frequent allu- 
sions to " now," the " present time," the " fu- 
ture," which detract from the value of what is 
labelled history. In a transition period, such 
as that through which we are passing, what 
may be true in 1898 may be radically false in 
1905. The style is argumentative, as though 
the writer had certain propositions to prove. 
Two sentences will illustrate : 

" It is doubtful whether a convention called at the 
present time to make a national Constitution would pro- 
vide for annual sessions of Congress." 

" The fate of the State Senate is a problem for the 
future." 

The value of the history is still further re- 
duced by expressions of opinion, which suggest 



the tricks of the platform and the bracketed 
newspaper comment, or else, being unsupported 
by evidence, carry no particular weight in oppo- 
sition to long-standing notions. Three or four 
such opinions are selected : 

" The Revolution bred innumerable lawsuits and an 
army of lawyers ranging in ability from John Marshall 
to Andrew Jackson." 

" John Adams was the father of the public school, 
the State University, the State College, and the normal 
school." 

" Clergymen were disqualified from civil office, not 
so much to separate Church and State as to improve the 
profession." 

The latter statement is clearly discredited in 
other chapters where the privileges of the clergy 
under new constitutions are fully discussed. 

The opinion expressed in connection with 
the discovery of the Columbia River by Robert 
Gray, that it established our claim to Oregon, 
and that " the law of discovery gave the Ore- 
gon country to the United States," can have 
little weight when it is recalled that Robert 
Gray was not an authorized representative of 
the United States, and that only after many 
years of joint occupation and after long nego- 
tiation did the United States and Great Brit- 
ain reach an agreement which recognized the 
Oregon country as part of the territory of the 
former. 

The governor, who is now an executive instead 
of a military character, is described in the words, 
" In popular fancy he was the man on horse- 
back ; to-day he is the man with the quill," a 
rather strange way to put a contrast between 
former days and the present, and this infelicity 
of language is accompanied by a declaration, 
which is not generally true, that whereas in 
other times the governor's message was a docu- 
ment which commanded respect, now it is " con- 
signed to a committee and forgotten." 

The chapters which are devoted to a study 
of the special constituencies mentioned have 
much of interest in them, and, despite the ad- 
verse criticisms which may be made, the history 
is a suggestive one, many problems of our social 
development being comprehensively treated in 
it, as nowhere else in convenient form. The 
widening of the suffrage, the disturbing influ- 
ence of the " free negro," the development of 
the frontier, the modification of ideas of gov- 
ernment brought about by the conditions in 
" the West," and similar subjects, furnish food 
for much thought. In some respects the work 
is a real contribution to the literature of Amer- 
ican social and political life, although the faults 
indicated and the apparently unfortunate title

A GREAT HISTORIAN'S TREATMENT 
OP CROMWELL,.* 



The promptness with which Mr. Gardiner's 
second volume on " The Commonwealth and 
Protectorate " the sixteenth upon the Stuart 
period makes its appearance is a striking 
evidence of the systematic and business-like 
methods of the author. The volume opens with 
an account of the new opinions that were get- 
ting hold of the popular mind in the last days of 
the Parliamentary government. In the general 
unrest, bred of reaction from the religious- 
ness of the Puritan, together with the awaken- 
ing of materialistic motives in the nation, Mr. 
Gardiner sees the seeds of the Restoration 
already bursting into life. This prepares for 
the consideration of the various projects of re- 
form which early thrust themselves upon the 
attention of the Long Parliament, and the 
increasing evidence of the inability of that body 
to acquit itself of the new and vast responsi- 
bilities of its position. 

In the account of the completion of the re- 
duction of Ireland, there is little to interest the 
reader. Police court records are always tame 
reading, after the war correspondents have had 
their say. In passing, however, it is to be no- 
ticed that Mr. Gardiner does not favor the 
Irish policy of the Commonwealth, though he 
stops to say a good word for Ireton. The plan 
of union with Scotland hardly meets with more 
favor. Yet it is difficult to see what other 
policy could have been adopted. Both countries 
were hotbeds of royal ism ; they had been re- 
duced by the sword, and only by the sword 
could they be held, and the possibility of future 
insurrection, or actual invasion of English soil, 
be forestalled. As it was, it must be admitted 
that, for the times, the concessions of Parlia- 
ment, and later of the Protector, were remark- 
ably liberal. Stern necessity forced the policy 
of Imperialism upon Parliament ; and if Impe- 
rial at all, its authority must be supported by 
a strong hand. Self-preservation demanded the 
subordination of both countries to the Comraon-

wealth, and the denial of rights within the em- 
pire equal to those of England. Here was both 
the strength and the weakness of the Common- 
wealth. 

With the outbreak of the Dutch War and 
the consequent breaking down of what little 
prestige there still remained to the Long Par- 
liament, the interest of the reader is thoroughly 
awakened. The cause of the war, as presented 
by Mr. Gardiner, is not to be found in the 
Navigation Act, but in a far more serious griev- 
ance. The English insisted upon the right of 
searching Dutch vessels for the goods of an 
enemy. They also insisted that all foreign ves- 
sels, when within the narrow seas, should strike 
their colors in recognition of the authority of 
the English flag over these waters. The effort 
to enforce these obnoxious measures upon the 
high-spirited Dutchmen brought on the first 
clash of arms. Other causes more remote had 
irritated either country and prepared it for re- 
sistance : particularly the ambition of certain of 
the English leaders for the absorption of the 
Protestant Netherlands in the new English 
Imperial system, together with no slight fear 
of the return of the House of Orange to power, 
thus threatening to give an additional support 
to the Stuart influence on the continent. This 
is somewhat different from the commonly ac- 
cepted view, which perhaps has given overmuch 
weight to the Navigation Act of 1651, a very 
mild and inoffensive measure compared with the 
later act of Charles II. The chapters following 
give a detailed account of the events of the war, 
and are the first attempt to treat of this subject 
with any fulness or completeness. It is inter- 
esting to notice that Mr. Gardiner agrees with 
Professor Laughton in rejecting the fable of 
Admiral Tromp's famous broom. 

The dissipation of the lingering respect of 
the nation for the Long Parliament is closely 
associated with this Dutch War. The leaders 
of Parliament were apparently dazed by the 
new responsibilities which the success of En- 
glish arms had thrust upon them, and were 
rendered nerveless by their knowledge of the 
corruption of the members and the growing 
contempt of the army. The war was the doing 
of neither Cromwell nor the army, and from 
the first had been unpopular with the people. 
It was contrary to all the traditions born of the 
bitter struggles of the past century that two 
Protestant nations, especially two so closely 
allied as the English and the Dutch, should 
seek to destroy each other. So, when at last 
the bankruptcy of the government compelled 



1898.] 



THE DIAL,

the Parliament to turn again to confiscation 
for relief, its doom was sealed. 

The act of dissolution made Cromwell a 
military dictator. But for the moment he 
shrank from the logical consequences of his 
audacity. Englishmen were not used to the 
idea of a dictator. They were familiar with a 
dictating Parliament. So at least the shadow 
of a Parliament Cromwell must have, in order 
to give the appearance of legality to the new 
government. But how should the new Parlia- 
ment be brought into being ? A new election by 
the people would naturally suggest itself to 
every Englishman. But Cromwell dared not 
trust the people. The reaction against Puri- 
tanism was already too strong. So, soldier-like, 
he went straight at his mark, and named his 
own Parliament. Of course, such a body could 
not be called a Parliament in any legal sense ; 
and the members, when they came together, 
seem to have been fully conscious of their am- 
biguous position. Mr. Gardiner attempts to 
impart some dignity to the body by calling it 
the " Nominated Parliament." The name is 
apt enough, but we confess to a liking for the 
old familiar " Barebones " a name which 
lacks dignity ; but then, that is what the " Bare- 
bones Parliament " lacked first and last. For 
a time, Cromwell let them have the leash. But 
when a real party of progress began to show 
itself, for all Englishmen were not as dead as 
Charles I., and some dared to have an opinion 
different from that of the Lord General, in a 
word, proposed to abolish state support of 
clergy and do away with the Court of Chan- 
cery, Cromwell saw that it was time to lay 
the spirit which he had called up. 

When the abdication of his spurious Parlia- 
ment was announced, with a fine show of sur- 
prise, hard to explain by his admirers who be- 
lieve always in the honest simplicity of their 
hero, he told the messengers that it was " a 
heavy responsibility " they were laying on his 
shoulders. Then followed the Instrument of 
Government and the appointment of the Lord 
General as Protector of the Realm. This docu- 
ment, for once a written constitution for En- 
gland, and upon which Cromwell held his brief, 
Mr. Gardiner has analyzed, and shows that, 
contrary to the prevailing opinion, Cromwell 
was by no means absolute, but was compelled 
to share his authority with the Council of 
State ; and suggests that the inability of the 
Protector always to bring the Council to his 
way of thinking may account for some of the 
vacillation of the Protectoral government, so 



hard to tally with the view of Cromwell which 
presents him as " a man of supreme ability and 
iron resolution." 

This is the most unsatisfactory part of the 
volume. Mr. Gardiner has an ill-disguised 
fondness for the old hero, and cannot break 
entirely with the traditional English interpre- 
tation of the administration of the Protector. 
He still sees in him the founder of England's 
foreign policy, of her navy, and of her Ocean 
Empire. Whereas it may be questioned whether 
Cromwell ever caught more than the vaguest 
glimpses of any great foreign policy. He was 
surrounded by visionaries of the most radical 
type. In the popular mind, moreover, there had 
taken shape a very definite policy, inherited 
from the struggle of the generation past : that 
England should cast in the weight of her great 
military prestige with the Protestant nations 
against the Inquisition. Cromwell's training 
had prepared him for the adoption of such 
a policy. Hence he did not favor the Dutch 
war, but leaned rather toward a league with 
Sweden and the Dutch against Spain and the 
Empire. But Cromwell first and last was a 
practical man. There was little of the poet in 
his nature, and sentiment received little con- 
sideration in the making of his plans. From 
his loftier point of view he could see what few 
Englishmen of his day saw, that the issues of 
the Thirty Years War were dead, and that the 
new material interests of England were rapidly 
drawing her into currents where poor old Spain 
and her Inquisition would have no more influ- 
ence than the rotting hulks of her ancient Ar- 
mada. To Cromwell, the maintaining of the 
great military state, which he had done so much 
to build up, and of which he was the sole head, 
was of far more importance than any partition 
of the colonial world with Protestant power or 
the building up of an anti-papal league. His 
motives were undoubtedly pure. He honestly 
believed, simple-hearted old soldier, that he was 
necessary to England ; and only as existing 
conditions could be preserved could the rights 
of Englishmen be maintained, or the fruits of 
victory be saved against the plotting of exiled 
Stuarts, the smoldering hostility of Ireland and 
Scotland, or the numerous factions at home. 
Here, then, was Cromwell's policy ; very differ- 
ent from the vast combination, the far-reaching 
planning of colonial empire, which is ascribed 
to him. The Commonwealth had been estab- 
lished by the sword ; it could be maintained 
only by the sword. To that end England must 
keep up her present military establishment.

[Oct. 1, 



ii-. however, was not such an easy matter, 
now that the open foes of the Commonwealth 
had been crushed or driven over-seas, and the 
direct demand for an army was no longer felt. 
The people wanted peace, and were unwilling 
to go on contributing of their means for the 
support of the old war footing. In other words, 
like Napoleon under somewhat similar circum- 
stances, Cromwell could not afford to remain 
long without war. He was as hard put to it 
for money as any beggar of a Stuart. What 
he needed was a profitable, self-supporting war. 
So, with the shrewdness of the soldier rather 
than of the statesman, regarding his own im- 
mediate needs rather than any remote conse- 
quences, he proposed that France or Spain, one 
or both, should furnish the money, and he 
apparently did not really care which, though 
Englishmen generally would have preferred 
to fight Spain. 

The political conditions of Europe at this 
time were extremely favorable for the plans of 
Cromwell. The long duel of Spain and France 
had reached a most critical point. In 1653 
Mazarin had again returned to power, " as om- 
nipotent as God the Father at the beginning of 
the world." But the government was weak- 
ened by a powerful revolt of its nobles, and the 
field of battle was in the heart of France. Yet 
Spain also had her troubles. Her ocean empire 
was declining rapidly, and financially she had 
been long since exhausted. Both parties seemed 
to feel that with England lay the decision of 
the long quarrel. Cromwell was evidently will- 
ing to interfere, but the side which he should 
support must be determined by the price paid. 

Now to Mr. Gardiner the great Protector 
seems here " vacillating, weak, and fickle." It 
is because Cromwell's real policy was not the 
policy which Mr. Gardiner thinks he ought to 
have espoused. There is in reality no fickleness, 
no weakness, no vacillation. On the contrary, 
he goes straight at his mark with a directness 
and bluntness and consistency which is almost 
brutal. Hence ensues the long series of nego- 
tiations with the two Catholic courts of the 
west, which Mr. Gardiner follows through to 
the end with characteristic patience. The posi- 
tion of Cromwell is not one of dignity ; yet he 
has no doubt in his own mind concerning the 
object which he seeks to gain. He is like nothing 
so much as a camel-driver haggling for back- 
shish. Yet, like a camel-driver, he knows ex- 
actly what he wants : it is money. He doesn't 
care which party rides his poor beast ; he knows 
they can't both ride at once, so he proposes 



that the one who secures the prize shall pay him 
well. 

Spain raised her bid at last to fifty thousand 
crowns a month. Some members of the Spanish 
council urged that as the whole fortune of Spain 
was at stake, even a hundred thousand crowns 
would be no exorbitant subsidy. Mazarin 
offered four, then five hundred thousand crowns 
a year. He also dangles Dunkirk before the 
eyes of the Protector, and offers to give him a 
free opportunity in the Indies, where he may 
enrich himself further upon Spain's treasure 
fleets. Still Cromwell hesitated, that he might 
force a still higher bid from the one party or 
the other. 

Now, this may be statesmanship, but it looks 
too much like business, and business, too, of 
a low order : blackmail, in fact, for there was 
always the covert threat of punishment to the 
unsuccessful bidder. War at best is a bad 
business, and civilized nations are accustomed 
to regard war as justified only when great prin- 
ciples are at stake. But here is your great 
Oliver, " founder of British foreign policy," as 
cool as a huckster, offering the blood of En- 
glishmen in open market to the highest bidder : 
the one, the traditional foe of England, the 
harborer of the exiled Stuarts ; the other, the 
relentless foe of Protestantism and the land of 
the Inquisition. 

At last France would go no further, and 
Cromwell was forced to close with Spain. But 
when Spain urged him to fulfil his contract 
and declare war against France, he hedged and 
postponed action. Two days later it transpired 
that he was again bargaining with the emissa- 
ries of Mazarin and offering to betray Spain if 
France would raise her figure. It is said in 
justification of this double-dealing that Oliver 
wanted Dunkirk, and he didn't care how he 
got it. But in the partial agreement of June 
18, 1654, Cromwell expressly stipulated that 
Dunkirk was to be held only as a security for 
the payment of the annual subsidy which 
France was to give him for his support. Nor 
can it be said that Oliver, in thus seeking at 
the last moment to ally with France against a 
power to which he had just solemnly pledged 
himself, was making a last effort to shelter the 
Huguenots ; for, in his anxiety to secure better 
terms than Spain had offered, he had ceased 
altogether to ask for any formal guarantee for 
the toleration of the French Protestants. 

Mr. Gardiner, with characteristic candor, is 
at last compelled to throw up in despair his task 
of finding '* a policy " for the Protector. " Thus

far," he concludes, " a study of the foreign 
policy of the Protectorate reveals a distracting 
maze of fluctuations. Oliver is seen alternately 
courting France and Spain, constant only in 
inconstancy." " After all allowance . . . 
much remains only to be accounted for by 
Oliver's own changeableness," a conclusion 
of the whole matter unworthy of an author as 
astute and penetrating as Mr. Gardiner usually 
is, and entirely out of keeping with what else 
we know of the great Protector. 

BENJAMIN TERRY. 



AX EXCYCL-OP^DIC "WORK ON INDIA.* 

Abbe Dubois is among the most interesting 
characters in the history of Christian missions 
in India. Born in 1770, dying in 1848, he 
spent thirty-one years in India, chiefly in the 
Dekhan and Madras Presidency. While in 
India he adapted himself to the people among 
whom he lived, adopting the native dress, speak- 
ing a native tongue, eating the food of the 
country, respecting the recognized rules regard- 
ing ceremonial cleanness and caste. So intimate 
was his acquaintance with Hindu life and char- 
acter that his opinion and advice were often 
important to English officials. In fact, the 
earlier manuscript of the work before us the 
only one heretofore translated and printed in 
English was purchased by the East India 
Company and printed at their expense. After 
his long service in the mission field, the Abbe 
returned to France in 1823, and lived there 
quietly until his death twenty-five years later. 

Remembering the Abbe's exceptional oppor- 
tunities, it is interesting to notice some state- 
ments which he makes in a work (" Letters on 
the State of Christianity in India ") printed 
soon after his return to France. He says : 

" Let the Christian religion be presented to these 
people under every possible light, . . . the time of con- 
version has passed away, and under existing circum- 
stances there remains no human possibility of brinerinsr 
it back." 

Again, in speaking of his own work, so wisely 
conducted, he says : 

" During the long period I lived in India in the capa- 
city of a missionary, I have made, with the assistance 
of a native missionary, in all between two and three 
hundred converts of both sexes. Of this number, two- 
thirds were Pariahs or beggars ; and the rest were com- 
posed of Sudras, vagrants, and outcasts of several 
tribes, who, being without resource, turned Christians in

order to form connexions, chiefly for the purpose of 
marriage or with some other interested views." 

These details and quotations are taken from 
a biographical sketch prefacing the present 
work, and written by Henry K. Beauchamp, 
the translator. Mr. Beauchamp's biography is 
interesting, and probably as complete as can be 
made, the Abbe having been a modest and re- 
tiring man. Mr. Beauchamp also is supposed 
to have annotated the work ; but his annotation 
is worse than none. His notes are few in num- 
ber, trivial in importance, and captiously criti- 
cal ; they neither elucidate the author nor tend 
to increase the reader's respect for him or his 
work. Max Miiller's prefatory note is almost 
as bad : it damns by faint praise. 

Dubois's work, however, is most important. 
The fact that it was written so long ago but 
makes it the more valuable ; many things, then 
commonplace, have now passed away forever. 
The Abbe's mode of life and his simplicity of 
character gave him exceptional opportunity to 
see and know. It is true that much of his 
description of the life and practice of the Brah- 
min was drawn from ancient writings rather 
than from experience, and was probably no 
more actual usage in his time than it is now ; 
but he also did know much even of high-caste 
life from personal knowledge, and gives many 
data of great importance. As for his statements 
regarding other castes, they are almost entirely 
based upon careful personal observation. 

The work is divided into three parts 
" General View of Society in India and General 
Remarks on the Caste System," " The Four 
States of Brahminical Life," " Religion." The 
first two of these is discussed in the minutest 
detail ; the sketch of Hindu religion, while less 
detailed, is still a significant and fairly sym- 
metrical discussion. The work may be said 
to be almost encyclopaedic for its field. The 
older English edition has been, ever since its 
appearance, a veritable mine of material for 
students. The present translation, based upon 
a later, enlarged, corrected, and everyway much 
improved manuscript, should be even more use- 
ful to the students now entering the field.

tive volumes, with the old-style wood-cuts, by the Open 
Court Publishing Co. This work is still an authority on 
Thibetan Buddhism, and by its pleasant narration of 
varied adventures will always be readable.

SOME RECENT BOOKS OF TRAVEL. 41 

Dr. John Thomson, the author of "Through 
China with a Camera," describes the China of to- 
day in a capable, well-written account, embellished 
with many very superior photographic illustrations. 
He gives in entertaining fashion his impressions of 
Hong Kong, Canton, Macao, Shanghai, etc., and 
also tells of a trip amongst the aborigines of For- 
mosa and of an expedition to the upper Yangstze. 
His description of a cheap and curious method the 
natives about Yen-Ping had of warming themselves 
is worth quoting. 

" Many of the men hereabouts appeared deformed, 
but the deformity was due to the small charcoal fur- 
naces which they carried concealed beneath their dress, 
and used to keep their bodies warm. As there are no 
fireplaces in the houses, these portable furnaces prove 
very convenient substitutes. At first, when I saw so 
many humps about, I supposed that some special dis- 
ease must be common in the place, or else that the suf- 
ferers had gathered themselves together from different 
parts of the empire to test the efficacy of some curative 
spring, like the hot wells near Foochow, where I had 
seen crowds of feeble and infirm folk bathing in the 
healing vapours. But the little copper furnaces encased 
in basket-work supplied a less melancholy explanation 
of the mystery." 

This is a good popular descriptive hook, and is 
handsomely manufactured. It lacks a map, but has 
an appendix of Fonnosan words which may be of 
service to the philologist. 

To the numerous books on Thibet, Captain M. S. 
Welby makes a notable and interesting contribution 
in his "Through Unknown Thibet." Starting from 
Srinagar, he with a small party travelled due east 
across central and unexplored Thibet for 2000 miles 
to Tankar on the confines of China. For many hun- 
dreds of miles he traversed the dreary " Roof of the 
World," 16000 feet above sea-level, entirely unin- 
habited, hut near the occasional fresh-water lakes, 
abounding in wild yak, antelope, and other game. He 
tells of seeing marmots " as large as men." " The 
holes down which they must have hidden were so 
large that I could have crawled down them myself." 
Captain Welby 's journey was in the highest degree 
adventurous, and lovers of adventure will read his 
narrative with absorbing interest. We are carried

afar from our seething civilization into another 
world, an isolated and desolate region, which even 
in the author's plain prosaic account powerfully 
stirs the imagination. The meeting with the Thib- 
etan caravan and the subsequent adventures with 
nomad Mongols are graphically told. Though 
Captain Welby's record shows no special literary 
quality, nor such close observation of men and 
things as we should desire, yet we are thankful for 
the modest, simple narrative of a notable exploit. 
The work is provided with elaborate and valuable 
maps, and it contains many illustrations, some of 
which are very good. 

"Halcyon Days in Norway, France, and the 
Dolomites," by Mr. W. M. Lent, is a fairly well writ- 
ton account of commonplace experiences in common 
touring trips. The enthusiastic descriptions of scen- 
ery are too prolix and frequent. The sketches in 
the second part of the book are extremely brief, and 
too often the book has the air of an itinerary. The 
paragraphing and literary structure show little care. 
The portion on the Dolomites has some value and 
interest, hut as a whole the work has little ralson 
d'etre. The illustrations are hackneyed, but are 
clearly executed. 

"Canada and its Capital," by the Hon. J. D. 
Edgar, is a popular summary, historical and de- 
scriptive, designed primarily to enlighten Canadians 
in general " about Ottawa, and the doings of the 
people there." The writer, who is Speaker of the 
Canadian House of Commons, naturally enlarges on 
political history and life, but he also gives attention 
to Ottawan literature and sport. He regards the 
question of annexation to the United States as " not 
a live one in Canada." The book has a number of 
interesting illustrations. 

In The Rainbow's End : Alaska," Mrs. A. P. 
Henderson gives her impressions of a trip, in 1897, 
from Chicago to Dawson by way of the Yukon 
River route. The narrative is distinctly feminine 
in its point of view, and is written in pleasant en- 
tertaining style. The author has also gleaned infor- 
mation from miners and others, on the animals of 
Alaska, particularly reindeer and dogs, on the In- 
dians, on the resources of Alaska, on the miner's 
outfit, etc. While giving little that is exactly new, 
the book is an intelligent and readable account. 
The photographic illustrations are of much interest. 

Mr. G. W. Steevens, whose recent book on ' The 
Conquering Turk " was lately reviewed in these col- 
umns, has followed up that work by a summary 
on Egypt, entitled "Egypt in 1898." He deals 
capably with English rule and influence, though 
sometimes in an over-glorifying strain. He also 
describes in a breezy way a Nile trip and a visit to 
the Coptic monastery of St. Mark ; and in connec- 
tion therewith he gives a capital little chapter to 
Cook, the mighty tourist agent. The hook is bright 
and incisive, with occasional undue straining for 
effect The guests at Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, he 
characterizes as " the people who live in their boxes 
and grand hotels, who know all lands but no Ian-

guages, who have been everywhere and done noth- 
ing, looked at everything and seen nothing, read 
everything and know nothing, who spoil the 
globe by trotting on it." Again, remarking on an- 
cient Egyptian art, he says : " The civilized idea of 
producing fine art is to make it beautiful : the bar- 
barous idea is to make it large." Mere obiter dicta 
are these expressions, but striking and suggestive. 
The illustrations are, unfortunately, rather blurry. 

Mr. J. E. Stevens, as commercial resident at 
Manila for a Boston firm, in 189496, has written 
down his experiences and impressions in lively 
manner in a book entitled " Yesterdays in the Phil- 
ippines." The volume is particularly devoted to 
describing social life and to a record of holiday 
excursions. In the light of recent events, it is 
interesting to notice that in celebrating the King's 
birthday one of the set pieces of fireworks was " a 
royal representation of a full-rigged man-of-war 
carrying the Spanish flag, and she was shown in the 
act of utterly annihilating an iron-clad belonging to 
some indefinite enemy." Mr. Stevens does not favor 
the possession of the Phillippines by the United 
States. While this book has not the thoroughness 
or competence of Foreman's comprehensive work, 
it is much more entertaining and popular, although 
its vivacity sometimes comes a little too close to flip- 
pancy and vulgarity. It contains a map and some 
interesting illustrations. 

The Rev. Francis E. Clarke, well known as the 
founder and president of the Christian Endeavor 
Union, described his recent world-trip in the inter- 
ests of this organization in a series of articles to 
various periodicals, and these he has now collected 
in a volume entitled " Fellow Travellers." The 
book contains sketches of mission work and impres- 
sions of countries and peoples, and is written in a 
simple, direct, modern style, which will recommend 
it to many other than the constituency primarily 
addressed. There are a few serviceable illustrations.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Economic aspects Dr : Cunningham's Western Civili- 
ty 'ancient zation in its Economic Aspects " 
civilization,. (Macmillan) is an examination of 
the main economic features in the growth and dif- 
fusion of civilized life in Western Europe ; and is 
therefore part of that reform in the writing of his- 
tory which insists that the life of the people, in 
ancient and mediaeval times, is at least as well worth 
studying as the battles and deaths of kings. Pro- 
fessor Cunningham considers, in well-ordered suc- 
cession, the commercial and industrial conditions 
which made or marred the prosperity of Egypt, 
Judaea, Phoenicia, Greece, Rome, and Constanti- 
nople. The temptation to diverge into excursus 
on other attractive features of ancient life must 
have been great ; but the author has adhered stead- 



ily to the path marked out, and, for this time at 
least, archaeology, art, and military annals have re- 
mained ancillary to their sister of to-day political 
economy. What strikes us most in this instructive 
essay is the fact that it approaches each of these 
ancient civilizations at the epoch of its greatest 
industrial or commercial prosperity, so that its spe- 
cial contribution may be extracted under the most 
favorable conditions ; instead of the traditional trac- 
ing of growth, culmination, and decay. Thus, the 
Phoenicians are studied at the time when they sailed, 
colonized, and traded over the whole Mediterranean ; 
the bloom-time of Greek history the age of Peri- 
cles is selected ; and Rome's industrial conditions 
are described as they existed in the best days of the 
Republic and the Empire. Cause and effect are 
clearly discriminated ; and in general the conclu- 
sions reached commend themselves to students of 
political history. On economic grounds, the author 
condemns the magnificent art-structures reared by 
Pericles on the Acropolis ; and the verdict, as one 
not often heard, is worth producing here : " The 
treasure was exhausted once for all, and there was 
no means of replacing it, such as arises with capital 
employed in industry or trade ; it was locked up in 
forms that are artistically superb, but economically 
worthless. There may be sentimentalists who are 
shocked at any such philistine efforts to appraise 
the economic importance of the grandest works of 
architectural art. But after all, we may appreciate 
them better if we know what they cost ; we may 
still feel that they were well worth the cost, but at 
least let us recognize what it was. A heroic action 
may cost a man his life, and we may hold it was a 
deed that was well worth dying for. So, too, it 
may be that the buildings on the Acropolis were 
well worth the strain they caused ; it is none the 
less true that they helped to exhaust the energies of 
Athens. . . . They proved to be a mere drain on 
the accumulated wealth of the present, while they 
gave no help of any sort for producing more wealth 
in the future. The wealth of Miletus was continu- 
ally circulating, and gave the means for an indus- 
trial community to grow and flourish ; the wealth 
of Athens and her allies was sunk, once for all, in 
creations of marvellous beauty." 

The origin, " The Founders of Geology " (Mac- 

and founders in ill an) is the title of a volume con- 
of geology. taining a course of six lectures deliv- 

ered at Johns Hopkins University by Sir Archibald 
Geikie, Director-General of the Geological Survey 
of Great Britain and Ireland. The work presents 
a history of geology, which had its germs in the 
writings of the cosmogonists, Leibnitz and Buffon, 
and in the labors of Guettard, who studied miner- 
alogy, palaeontology, and physiography, from about 
the middle of the last century, but whose name, 
even, is nearly forgotten. A science of such intrin- 
sic interest soon aroused votaries. Desmarest

Werner, with his Neptunian theory, assuming that 
all rocks were deposited under water. The origin 
of basalt was the bone of contention in those days : 
was it born of water or fire? The Neptunists out- 
numbered the Vulcanists. After a time, Hutton 
entered the arena. He distinguished between sed- 
imentary and igneous rocks, holding that granite 
and basalt were erupted from the interior of 
the earth. The discussion was long and bitter. 
The disposition to generalize upon an inadequate 
knowledge of facts was unavoidable. Both parties 
knew a little truth and imagined a great deal of 
error. About the beginning of the present century 
appeared Cnvier and Brongniart, who laid the 
foundation of stratigraphic geology, illustrated by 
palaeontology, zoology, and comparative anatomy. 
William Smith, their contemporary, made the be- 
ginnings of a geological survey of England. The 
work, having now assumed the outlines of its true 
proportions, was further aided in England, Scot- 
land and Wales, by Sedgwick and Murchison, who 
developed the classification of the Devonian, Silu- 
rian, and Cambrian systems. William Allen Logan 
showed how the outlines of European geology were 
applicable to explain the geological conditions found 
in the United States and Canada. Adding a dis- 
cussion of glacial geology as studied in Switzer- 
land, the British Isles, and America by Agassiz, 
of petrography by Nicol, Bryson, and Sorby, the 
lecturer closes with a brief account of the labors of 
Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin. The interest 
and value of the course of lectures lies in the com- 
prehensive view given of the progress made by geol- 
ogy in the past century and a half to its present 
commanding position in the circle of the natural 
sciences. 



Tto lot** The volume entitled " Light, Visible 

jactt and iheoriet and Invisible " (Macmillan) is made 
about Ltgiu. U p Q f rgpQjtg o f B j x lectures delivered 

by Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, at the Royal 
Institution in London. Lectures presented, as were 
these, to large and popular audiences, must be cast 
in a style addressed to the intelligent layman ; must 
present the latest phases of discovery and of theory, 
abreast with the most advanced science ; and must 
be profusely and aptly illustrated. In each of these 
respects these lectures display the skill of one who 
is master both of his subject and of the methods of 
its presentation. The fertility of invention which 
has devised new forms of experiment, and the skill 
of manipulation in presenting illustrations new and 
old, show the same aptness which gave Tyndall his 
fame as an exponent as well as a discoverer of sci- 
ence. The lecturer has not attempted to cover the 
entire field. Geometrical optics is necessarily 
avoided . and with it the theory and construction of 
optical instruments, together with spectrum analysis 
and most of the subject of color vision. The theory 
of light-waves is plainly elucidated ; so are polari- 
zation, the spectrum visible and invisible, and the 
later discoveries as to the kathode or Rontgen rays. 



The method of producing pictures for commercial 
uses, in which every conceivable hue, tint, and tone 
may be reproduced by printing successively yellow, 
red, and blue pigments upon white paper, is simply 
and clearly explained. The crucial phase of the 
process is that before the light from a multi-colored 
object is allowed to fall upon a sensitized plate in a 
camera it has been made to pass through a filter 
that has arrested all rays but those of one potency, 
yellow, red, or blue. One negative is thus made 
with yellow rays only ; another with red only ; an- 
other with blue only, and from each a corresponding 
positive is made, or a half-tone plate is prepared. 
From the half-tone plate made by yellow light a 
print is made with yellow ink ; on this the plate 
from the red superposes a print made with red ink ; 
on this the plate from the blue adds its contribution 
printed with blue ink. The result is a picture of 
a perfection hitherto unknown. 

Another work on the American Navy 
serves to show the remarkable revival 
of interest felt by the people of the 
United States in that single institution of theirs 
which has always been both ornamental and useful. 
The Navy Department informs the public that the 
personnel of the men seeking to enlist for service on 
the sea has been changed very much for the better 
since the victory at Manila taught the infant Amer- 
ican mind that it, too, could learn to shoot ; and 
Mr. Charles Morris, with " The Nation's Navy " 
(Lippincott), emphasizes the fact that five years 
have hardly elapsed since Mr. Edgar Stanton 
Maclay gave Americans the first history they had 
ever had an opportunity to read for instruction in 
respect of their ships and sailors. Since then, 
Roosevelt, Barnes, Spears, and others, have pub- 
lished histories ; Captain Mahan has risen to the 
first eminence, at home and abroad ; two or three 
men and one woman have written cheerful historical 
novels, mostly for the young, in which the interest 
is both American and nautical ; several admirals in 
our service, notably Trenchard and Franklin, have 
added memoirs of much interest ; and a bushel or 
so of poets have celebrated the deeds of the sea- 
fighters of America, who in this respect had there- 
tofore been sadly neglected. Among all these there 
is still room for such a book as Mr. Morris has de- 
vised. He opens with a brief account of what has 
been done in the past to make the Stars and Stripes 
respected on the seas, and he concludes with the 
tale of the " New Navy." There are few omissions 
of consequence, the most serious of them being in 
respect of the recent rebuilding of certain ships; 
and an excellent handbook results. 



Hawaii 

ourf more. 



Numerous as have been the books 
about Hawaii of late, Miss Mary H. 
Krout's " Hawaii and a Revolution " 
(Dodd) offers much that is new and varied. As 
the title indicates, the book contains considerable 
descriptive matter, which, however, is not confined

to the theme, but includes a visit to Samoa (and 
Stevenson), Australia, and New Zealand. The 
author did not travel extensively through the 
Islands, hence her treatment of the unique natural 
phenomena there presented is not so complete as 
that of some of her predecessors. She is happy in 
describing people, places, and institutions which 
came to her notice, and her anecdotes and personal 
incidents give a strong local color to the book. Po- 
litically, the author is frankly on the side of the 
party which successfully carried through the revo- 
lution, though she acknowledges that she went to 
the Islands with strong sympathy for the natives as 
a people who had been unjustly defrauded of their 
rights. The dealings of the United States with the 
Provisional Government are treated at length, with 
outspoken criticism of the president, cabinet officer, 
commissioner, and minister who conducted them. 
At times her statements pass the point of guarded 
expression and become captious fault-finding. The 
author apologizes for the frequent recurrence of 
the personal pronoun. The brave spirit in which 
she did her work in the presence of much personal 
suffering deserves commendation, but undoubtedly 
the repeated reference to private inconvenience 
mars the result from a literary point of view. 



Wild life 
infield 
and wood. 



Very entertaining tales of the wild 
animals of the woods and meadows 
and brooks of New England are to be 
found in Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews's " Familiar Life 
in Field and Forest" (Appleton). A true student 
of nature, the author has succeeded in making the 
acquaintance of such uncanny folk as " our ancient 
enemy the ophidian," and of " that famous essence- 
peddler " and much slandered friend of the orchard 
and garden. Frequent references to the best Amer- 
ican authorities upon all points of scientific import- 
ance are supplemented by the writer's own obser- 
vations and abundant drawings ; while a series of pho- 
tographs of wild animals, by Mr. W. L. Underwood, 
add much to the interest in the book. A popular 
account is given of the common frogs, salamanders, 
snakes, a few of the birds, and most of the mammals, 
of the Eastern States, and the story is told in such a 
pleasing manner that every lover of Nature will be 
charmed with this new glimpse at these shy little 
people of the woods. The preface contains a plea 
for their preservation that every boy (and many 
would-be sportsmen) should read and heed. 



The story of 
the Franks. 



Mr. Lewis Sergeant's work on " The 
Franks, from their Origin as a Con- 
federacy to the Establishment of the 
Kingdom of France and the German Empire " is a 
compact volume of about 350 pages in the " Story of 
the Nations " series (Putnam). The limits of the nar- 
rative are dimly defined at the beginning, sharply at 
the end. The author recognizes the difficulty of sepa- 
rating what is historically authentic " from that which 
at best has but a dubious origin." That he has well 
discharged the task will be conceded by most read- 



ers. From the middle of the third century, when 
the Franks are first mentioned in history, down to 
987, when Hugh Capet was acknowledged King of 
France, is an ample space to cover ; but Mr. Ser- 
geant has gone patiently, even briskly, over it all. 
He has made good use of his authorities, from Tac- 
itus to Palgrave, and gives us results rather than 
citations. Legends are generally discarded, but the 
story is none the less attractive for that. Of helps 
to make the book useful as a manual of reference 
there is no lack, such as genealogical tables, terri- 
torial maps, and two indexes, one being of Roman 
names with their modern equivalents. The volume 
is handsomely illustrated, the frontispiece being an 
excellent wood-cut from Durer's famous painting of 
Charlemagne. In the matter of spelling, Mr. Ser- 
geant very sensibly adheres to the popular forms, 
and writes Clovis instead of Hlodowig or Chlodo- 
vech. But he would have done better to spell the 
name of the eastern kingdom Austrasia (with 
Kitchin and others) instead of Austria, if only to 
avoid confusion with the later great empire of the 
Hapsburgs. 

A Yankee There are two good reasons why 

Professor Prof . Moses Coit Tyler should repub- 

in England. jjg^ e8sav8 written during a sojourn 

in England, ending in 1866, at just this time : one is 
the unusual interest felt in British affairs since the 
two nations learned, a month or two ago, how to be 
reasonably polite to one another ; the second is the 
increased interest felt in anything Professor Tyler 
has written, by reason of his recent praiseworthy 
services in behalf of American letters. The little 
papers which make up the contents of " Glimpses of 
England" (Putnam) are popular in treatment, 
good-natured in manner, and interesting in sub- 
stance. The traditional attitude of America toward 
the English intellect is humorously upheld, and with 
it such a real appreciation of all that has made En- 
gland the envy of the European world as should be 
expected from such a writer. The period covered 
is the exceedingly interesting though provoking one 
of the Civil War and its close, and the veering senti- 
ment of the ruling classes abroad receives adequate 
attention. Some of the tales have been worn thread- 
bare by the lapsing years, but their repetition is the 
more readily pardoned since Professor Tyler was 
their original discoverer in most cases. 



A student's 
Motley. 



Any condensation of Motley's " Rise 
of the Dutch Republic " necessarily 
destroys much of the charming style 
and eloquent language of the original work, and 
Dr. William Elliot Griffis's attempt in this direction, 
in his " Student's Motley " (Harper), proves no 
exception to the rule. Persons who are inclined to 
historical reading, and presumably " students " also, 
will still prefer to read Motley himself ; while for 
those, if there are any such, who desire to avoid 
the philosophy of history, and to garner only a 
series of facts, the book is not suited, inasmuch as 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



the original matter in the work is reduced bat a 
little more than a third by this condensation. In 
Part VII., which continues the history of Holland 
from the death of William the Silent to the present 
time, Dr. Griffis has given us his own interpreta- 
tion of historical events, and his work is marked 
by scholarly care and excellent writing. The chap- 
ten devoted to Dutch history in the seventeenth 
century are especially valuable, and constitute in 
some respects a distinct contribution to historical 
writing, because of their clearness and accuracy of 
statement and fine characterization. In fact, one 
is led to regret that the author did not devote more 
time and space to a history of later Holland instead 
of attempting a condensation of Motley. The book 
is noteworthy for the numerous excellent portraits 
of the men and women of importance in the polit- 
ical and religions history of the nation. It contains 
a map of modern Holland and Belgium, and has 

a good index. 

TtoPUorimti* Another book by the same author 
their th%?hL*t. " Th Pilgrims in their Three 
Homes," issued in very attractive 
form by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Aside 
from the chapters on Bradford and firewater, which 
are interesting, and might be collected in entirety 
from scattered pages of the " Student's Motley," 
the book has little that is attractive save to the stu- 
dent of genealogies. While there are many evidences 
of the author's study and of his familiarity with the 
conditions which existed in the historic places he 
has undertaken to describe, the narration is so dis- 
connected, as where he jumps from the discussion 
of the constitution of the early English hundred in 
one paragraph, to an account, in the next, of the 
coal production in Nottinghamshire, that the 
reader receives no clear picture of the life or sur- 
roundings of the Pilgrims'in any one of their three 
homes. The impression received from the book is 
that it was written to utilize numerous odd ends of 
information gathered in preparation of other and 
more scholarly works. 

The fifth monthly volume in the new 
biographical edition " of Thack- 
eray (Harper) contains the " Sketch 
Book," Irish and Parisian, together with the " Jour- 
ney from Cornhill to Cairo." Mrs. Ritchie's intro- 
duction is extremely interesting for its intimate 
revelation of the novelist during the years of his 
early struggle for a fame just beginning to be 
achieved. Here is a bit of rollicking pessimism 
from a letter of 1841 : " Please when you write not 
to give me any account whatever of any gaieties in 
which you indulge, or any sort of happiness falling 
to the share of you or anybody else. But if any- 
body meets with an accident, is arrested, ruined, has 
a wife run away with, if C. falls ill and is marked 
with the smallpox, do be so kind as to write me off 
word immediately, and I will pay the post cheerfully. 
. . . Despair, madam, is the word. Byronish, I hate 
mankind, and wear my shirt-collar turned down."

BRIEFER MENTION. 



It is now nine years since the appearance of Professor 
Woodrow Wilson's " The State," and they have been 
years of increasing appreciation of the admirable quali- 
ties of that text-book of political science. It represented 
to a large extent a breaking of new ground in the field 
of college work, and won for itself from the start so 
firm a foothold that we wondered something of the sort 
had not been done before. But the political world 
moves not a little in a decade of these modern times, 
and a revision was needed. Such an improved edition 
has just been published (Heath), embodying the latest 
arrangements of the political kaleidoscope, both in this 
country and in Europe, and the stout volume of over 
six hundred pages is made more valuable than ever be- 
fore by the timely revision to which it has been subjected. 

Rear Admiral Franklin, in bis " Memories " (Harper), 
gives a running picture of his life in the U. S. Navy, 
from 1841 till his retirement from active service in 
1888. Many are the changes which he describes in the 
evolution of the " New Navy." His narrative is very 
informal, going into many personal details, giving im- 
pressions as made upon his mind, and describing places 
and persons with great interest. We confess that we 
sometimes feel a lack of dignity in the book; and yet 
perhaps this contributes in a way to the piquancy of the 
narrative. 

The Sixteenth Annual Report of the Dante Society, 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co., has for its chief fea- 
ture a discussion, by Mr. Paget Toynbee, of Professor 
Rajna's critical text of the " De Vulgari Eloquentia." 
Mr. T. W. Koch carries on, for the two years 1895-97, 
his list of additions to the Harvard Dante collection, 
which now numbers over two thousand volumes. New 
subjects for the Harvard Dante prize are announced, 
and an increase in the membership of the Society is re- 
ported by the secretary, Mr. Arthur Richmond Marsh. 
There are nearly a hundred living members, a number 
which should be at least doubled during the coming year. 

We might almost think that we know all that is nec- 
essary of the Sepoy Rebellion; but those most familiar 
with that event will most keenly enjoy the record of 
" Daily Life during the Indian Mutiny," by Mr. J. W. 
Sherer, who, in his civic relationship, was intimately 
associated with the English leaders. Mr. Sherer does 
not intend his work as an independent history, but as a 
supplement to other larger works, giving in familiar 
form many facts that the more pretentious historians 
would not include. (Macmillan.) 

That veteran and indefatigable bicyclist, Mrs. E. R. 
Pennell, tells in her bright way a pleasant story of a 
pleasant trip, in a brochure entitled " Over the Alps on 
a Bicycle" (Century Co.). The clever drawings by 
Mr. Pennell add to the enjoyment of the reader, and 
the appendix on the route will be useful to the intending 
traveller. 

To one who knows Princeton merely through its ex- 
ploits celebrated in the daily papers, such a book as 
Mr. James W. Alexander's " Princeton, Old and New** 
(Scribner) seems to supply a little touch of final beauty 
which the university itself appears to lack in a degree. 
The book U handsomely printed and bound, and the 
contents, though brief, are filled with just such gentle 
dignity at serves to tone down the crudity of under- 
graduate life. It is, in brief, a book for the Princeton 
man to live up to.

LITERARY :NOTES. 



" Beauchamp's Career " and " The Adventures of 
Harry Richmond " have just been added to the new edi- 
tion of Mr. George Meredith's novels. Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons are the publishers. 

The awakening of interest in the Navy has occasioned 
the bringing out of a new and cheap edition of Messrs. 
Scribner's series on " The Navy in the Civil War," the 
three volumes issued being by Professor Soley, Admiral 
Ammen, and Captain Mahan. 

"The Plan of an Ethical Sunday School," by Mr. 
W. L. Sheldon, describing the work done by the Ethical 
Society of St. Louis, is published in pamphlet form by 
Mr. S. Burns Weston, of Philadelphia. It is a sugges- 
tive little book, and offers a reasonable solution of an 
increasingly difficult religious problem. 

The series of " Stories by Foreign Authors," published 
by the Messrs. Scribner, is now complete in ten volumes, 
like the corresponding series of " Stories by English 
Authors " and " Stories by American Authors." The 
three series taken together, in thirty neat volumes, offer 
a liberal selection of the best modern fiction in minia- 
ture. The average is about six stories to the volume. 

"The Story of Gladstone's Life," by Mr. Justin 
McCarthy, is perhaps the best of the popular biographies 
of the great politician who died a few months ago, and 
in the new edition, just published by the Macmillan Co., 
the story is finished with chapters upon the last year of 
Gladstone's life. It now makes a handsome volume of 
more than five hundred pages, abundantly illustrated, 
and printed in large type upon heavily glazed paper. 

" Kant und Helmholtz," by Dr. Ludwig Goldschmidt, 
is the title of a study in popular science published by 
Herr Leopold Voss, of Leipzig. After an introductory 
chapter upon the general points of comparison between 
the two great thinkers, and a brief analysis of the Kant- 
ian doctrine, the treatise reaches the special subject of 
" Die Raumfrage," with which the work is chiefly con- 
cerned, and which carries on the discussion with special 
reference to the non-Euclidean forms of geometry. 

Dr. C. Alphonso Smith's "An Old English Grammar 
and Exercise Book " (Allyn & Bacon) has just been 
reissued in a new and enlarged edition. At the same 
time, we have from Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. an 
" Anglo-Saxon Prose Reader," prepared by Professors 
W. M. Baskervill and James A. Harrison. There are 
only about forty pages of selections, but a number of 
texts are included that have not generally been used in 
elementary books of this sort, thus giving the reader a 
certain degree of freshness. 

A journal that should have an extended circulation 
in this country is " The National Review " of London, 
both for the large space which it gives to American 
affairs, and for the tone and spirit friendly but not 
patronizing, frank but not fatuous in which they are 
treated. A nation, like an individual, likes to be under- 
stood; and the editor of "The National," and those of 
his contributors who are permitted to write on Amer- 
ican affairs, show in the main that they understand 
Americans better often than they understand them- 
selves. The comments of the editor, Mr. Maxse, in the 
admirable department of " Episodes of the Month," are 
forceful and informing; there is also a well-written 
regular department of " American Affairs," by Mr. A. 
Maurice Low; while the special articles on military and 
naval events, by such expert authorities as Mr. H. W. 



Wilson and Admiral Colomb, are not excelled in value 
by anything printed anywhere. " The National "'is de- 
voted largely to political affairs of universal interest, 
Lord Salisbury, Hon. George Curzon, Hon. A. J. Bal- 
four, among others, being contributors in this field; 
while literature proper is represented by Mr. Leslie 
Stephen, Mr. H. D. Traill, Sidney J. Low, and other 
names as well known in this country as in England. 
" The National " should have an American office and a 
substantial American constituency.

NEW BOOKS. 
Islands of the Southern Seas. 

By MICHARL MYERS SHOEMAKER, author of " East- 
ward," "The Kingdom of the White Woman," 
"Trans-Caspia,"etc. Second Edition. With 80 illus- 
trations. STO, gilt top, $2.25. 

An interesting record of a journey through far-off seas and 
among strange lands and peoples. The volume includes a 
description of "The Isle of the I>.-\il." the French conTict 
prison where Captain Dreyfus is con6ned. 

" The author has not only a cultured style and highly de- 
scriptive power, but a quiet, delightful humor. MoreoTer, he 
is always interesting. Simple and unaffected throughout, he 
writes occasionally with such deep feeling that he irresistibly 
recalls to us the gentle Nathaniel Hawthorne. The illustra- 
tions throughout are excellent and as fittingly clear and incis- 
ive as the author's style demands. A more readable book on 
the nowadays somewhat hackneyed subject of travel in the 
Southern Seas has never been printed, and we unhesitatingly 
commend it." London Chronicle. 

Matthew Arnold 

And the Spirit of the Age. Papers of the En- 
glish Club of Sewanee, for the Season of 1897. 
Edited, with an Introduction, by its President, the 
Reverend GREENOUOH WHITE, A.M., B.D., Professor 
of Ecclesiastical History in the University of the 
South; author -of " An Outline of the Philosophy of 
English Literature," "A Saint of the Southern 
Church," etc. 8vo, 01.26. 

" If a recent publication entitled ' Matthew Arnold and 
the Spirit of the Age' had fallen into the hands of Mr 
Howells previous to his recent discourse upon American liter- 
ary centres, he might haTe added Sewanee, Tenn., to his list. 
. . . The book of the Club makes an attractive showing, and 
sets an excellent example to other similar organizations." 
The Dial. 

Capriccios. 

Dramatic Sketches. By Louis J. BLOCK, author of 
" The New World," etc. 12mo, 81.25. 
" Five pieces in dramatic form make up ' Capriccios.' The 
first Heals, in verse and rhythmic prose, with the birth, life,

Maeterlinck and occasionally Whitman. The second attaches 
itself to the legend of Faust. Two others deal with ideals of 
art, and the last is a charming prose Prothalamion. Mr. Block

Beginning with the September (1898) issue, which was the first of Vol. 
VIII., SELF CULTURE was greatly enlarged in size and scope, its price 
reduced from 82.00 to 81.00 a year, and illustrations introduced. While 
the pictures are the best half-tone work, they are designed to really 
illustrate the text, and not for purposes of embellishment. The maga- 
zine also now appears in a new and attractive dress. Every number will 
contain 128 double-column pages of text, printed on fine paper, from 
clear type. It is intended to have from three to five articles every 
month of the same high character as the best discussions of The Forum, 
North American Review, and Atlantic Monthly, while the remaining 
articles will be of a more purely literary, historical, and instructive 
character. No effort will be spared to make SELF CULTURE an ideal 
periodical for the best homes, and it will be the constant study of its 
publishers to have each number so made up as to secure the attention 
of every member of the family old enough to take any interest in good 
literature. We pledge our best efforts to make the magazine always, 
and in every way, wholesome, stimulating, and helpful. 

Chillicothe, Ohio, Sept. 14, 1898. 

Editor of SELF CULTURE : When I read of your intended change of 
price and form, I was sorry ; but the September number assures me 
that SELF CULTURE is still to be worth six of those magazines which 
busy workers and students look over and lay down, finding life is too 
short for such diluted indulgence. SELF CULTURE has been a stimulus 
and a help to me in my work, and I wish it the highest success. 

MARGARET C. GILMORE. 
Columbus, Ohio, Sept. 21, 1898. 

Gentlemen : The change in your magazine is a great improvement, 
although it was good enough before, and will no doubt meet with a great 
success. I like it because its pages are not filled with the gaudy pictures 
of the goddesses of the stage, and there is no cheap fiction in it, nothing 
of a light and transient character, but everything that appears in it can 
be " pinned in the hat " and remembered. It is refreshing to read it 
after wading through the chaff of the " popular " magazine. So long 
as it sticks to the line it has been pursuing, it will certainly continue to 
grow. R. W. WALTON.

THE OMAHA EXPOSITION. 

When the World's Fair at Chicago ceased to exist, it 
was supposed we should ne'er look upon its like again. 
However, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha 
has effectively reproduced in similarity all of the build- 
ings which made the White City so attractive in 1893. 

It does not now take weeks to wander through grounds 
and structures and then be compelled to go away with 
a jumble of ideas, for the Omaha Exposition people have 
profited by past experience, and have so improved the 
arrangement of exhibits that no more than two or three 
days of time need be consumed in admiration and inspec- 
tion of the marvellous resources of the West, collected 
together in the chief city of Nebraska. 

Even the new Midway is a reproduction of the far- 
famed Street of All Nations of 1893, with many improve- 
ments upon the original. 

The electric lighting of the buildings, grounds, and 
lagoon at night makes a scene of enchanting beauty, alone 
worth traveling a thousand miles to see. The means of 
communication between the city and the grounds are 
ample, and the distance to be traversed is short. 

The ways of reaching Omaha are innumerable, but 
chief among them is the direct Chicago and Omaha 
short line of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Rail- 
way, with its electric-lighted, vestibuled trains, leaving 
Chicago every night at 6 :15 p. m., and arriving at Omaha 
at 8 :20 the next morning. Dining car service en route. 

Excursion tickets are on sale at every coupon ticket 
office in the United States over the Chicago, Milwaukee 
& St. Paul Railway through Northern Illinois and Cen- 
tral Iowa, as well as at 95 Adams St., and at the Union 
Passenger Station, Canal and Adams Sts., Chicago. 

The Colorado Midland Railway 

Is the best line to Colorado and the 

Klondike. 

It has the best through car service in 

the West. 

Four trains daily each way. 

Reaches the greatest mining and fruit 

country in the world.

This work aims at completeness and comprehensiveness, at the same time studying conciseness and condensation in detail by a thorough

experience in practical teaching. The period covered is from the first century to the Italian Renaissance in the 16th century. The maps are 
a striking feature, and add much to the usefulness of the book.

artistic, and literary excellence. It is practical in a way and to a degree that we do not remember to have found to be the case in any similar 
work. It does more than undertake to solve the mysterious problems of mental action. It gives not a little wholesome guidance to students 
who want to learn how to think."

" Psychology for Teachers " has already made a remarkable impression in England, and wherever known in this country has proved so

The Battle of the Strong. 

By GILBERT PARKER, author of The Seats of 
the Mighty," etc. 12mo, s 1 ..-><. 

Few novelists now writing in America or England 
reach a larger or more attentive audience than that which 
welcomes a new story by Gilbert Parker. The scenes 
of " The Battle of the Strong " are principally in the 
Isle of Jersey. The story opens early in 1781, when a 
company of French soldiers is sent to capture the island 
from the British. Without giving the plot, it may be 
said that the time is one of great historical significance; 
the French Revolution casts its strong, fierce light on 
the scene ; and war, loyalty, treason, love, and devotion 
lend a most truthful and often tragic variety to the tale. 
The story is of ingrossing interest, and is told with a 
power and mastery which will add even to Mr. Parker's 
already great reputation as a novelist.

Poems Old and New. By JULIA WARD HOWE. 
12mo, gilt top, $1.50. 

Mrs. Howe, who is almost world-famous for her 
" Battle-Hymn of the Republic," is one of the foremost 
of American poets in breadth and elevation of view. 
She has selected from her volumes previously published 
the poems which seem to her best, and has added many 
not before included in any book, forming a volume which 
will be highly valued by lovers of poetry and by those 
who hold Mrs. Howe in deep and tender regard. 

The Tides and Kindred Phenomena in 
the Solar System. 

By GEORGE HOWARD DARWIN, Plumium Professor 
and Fellow, Trinity College, University of Cambridge. 
12mo, 82.00. 

This book embodies the results of many years of 
observation and study, and is the most authoritative vol- 
ume yet written on the causes, origin, movements, and 
diversity of tides. Its interest is greatly increased by 
its treatment of similar phenomena in the vast system 
of which our earth is so small a part. 

The Leather-Stocking Tales. 

By JAMES FKXIMORK COOPER. New River tide 
Edition from new plates. With a new Frontispiece 
illustration to each volume. 5 vols. 12mo, handsomely 
bound, 96.25 a set. (Sold only in sets.) 

An entirely new and very desirable library edition of 
Cooper's famous Leather-Stocking Tales: The Doer- 
slayer, The Last of the Mohicans, The Pathfinder, The 
Pioneers, The Prairie. They have been carefully edited, 
are printed and bound in better style than heretofore, 
and merit a place in public and household libraries.

T ife and Letters of Paul the Apostle. 

By LYMAN ABBOTT, D.D., author of " The Evolu- 
tion of Christianity," "Christianity and Social Problems," 
and " The Theology of an Evolutionist" 12mo, $1.50. 
Dr. Abbott here fully and forcibly elucidates the 
theory that the history of organized Christianity through 
the ages is the history of the intermingling of the pagan 
conception of God, the Jewish conception, and the 
Christian conception of Him as a father who gives life 
freely to all who will accept the gift. This last, argued 
and affirmed in wonderful variety of form, Dr. Abbott 
regards as the special gospel of Paul. 

The Life of Our Lord in Art. 

With some Account of the Artistic Treatment of 
the Life of St. John the Baptist. By ESTELLK M. HURLL, 
editor of Mrs. Jameson's Art Works. With 16 full-page 
illustrations and over 80 text drawings. 8vo, $3.00. 

Miss Hurll, who is exceptionally qualified for this 
work, includes a descriptive history of the artistic treat- 
ment of every incident in the life of Christ which has 
been made the subject of art, and the account embraces 
not only the works of the old masters, but is brought 
down to the art of our day. The book is issued in the same 
style with Miss Hurll's edition of Mrs. Jameson's Art 
Works, and the illustrations are of the same character. 

Qorona and Coronet. 

^* By MABEL Looms TODD. With many illustra- 
tions. Crown 8vo, $2.50. 

This is a sprightly account of the Amherst Eclipse 
expedition to Japan in the yacht Coronet in 1896. The 
incidents of travel are brightly told, and the hairy Ainu* 
of northern Yezo are described, as well as the solar 
eclipse. Some chapters are devoted to the people, 
scenery, history, and volcanoes of Hawaii. The book 
is illustrated from numerous photographs taken by the 
expedition. 

X World of Green Hills.

Mr. Torrey here confines himself mostly to the 
mountain region of Virginia and North Carolina, where 
he finds many birds which are old New England ac- 
quaintances. His genius for observation and his art ia 
description are as fresh and delightful as ever.

The history of the present royal house of Italy is full of romantic 
incidents, but, as far at least as English-speaking readers are concerned, 
it is thus far little known. Mine. Weil has had at her command in the 
preparation of these volumes a large mass of original information, partly 
in the shape of manuscripts and archives that have not heretofore been 
brought into print. The sketches that have been based upon her re- 
searches, while gracefully written and popular in style, are, therefore, 
the result of careful historic investigation.

RUDYARD KIPLING'S NEW BOOK 



3d Edition Printed \ "THE DAY'S WORK." | Before 



I TNQUESTIONABLY the most noteworthy event of 1898 in the world of books is this new 
^ volume containing twelve stories by Mr. Kipling. Not only is it the product of his most 
mature genius thus far, but its range is extraordinary from the delicate dream quality of 
" The Brushwood Boy," for instance, to those stirring tales in which he voices the monstrous 
throbbings of the marine engine and the American locomotive. The volume has been making 
for three or four years, and is the best work of an author who stands easily at the head of 
contemporary writers. The extraordinary advance demand necessitated the printing of three 
large editions to supply the booksellers' first orders.

A COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 

The University of Chicago fills in the educa- 
tional firmament a place similar to that occu- 
pied in the actual heavens by those novce that 
flash out from time to time, perplexing the 
astronomer with the question as to the probable 
endurance of their brilliancy. No university 
has ever had more advertising, or kept itself 
more conspicuously in the public eye. The 
success in this case has been for the most part 
legitimate ; for the foundations of a solid insti- 
tution of learning have been laid, and the essen- 
tials have been well provided for. Nor is there 
any reason to anticipate for this university the 
fate that might be suggested by our introduc- 
tory trope, since the large endowments already 
in hand, and the further endowments almost 
sure to follow, insure for the institution a place 
among the fixed stars. But its most serious 
friends have more than once had occasion to 
question some of the extensions of its activity, 
and to feel that even its great store of reserve 
energy might be taxed too heavily ; that by 
reaching out in too many directions at once, by 
lending itself to educational experiments in 
such great variety, by seeking to exert its influ- 
ence in so many fields of intellectual activity, 
it might incur the danger to which the higher 
education in a democratic age and country is 
peculiarly exposed the danger of cheapening 
the ideals that should always be associated with 
the name of University, of stooping too low to 
conquer a kind of success that is not worth 
conquering at such a cost, and that may well be 
left to such popular agencies as " Chautauqua " 
assemblies and " Cosmopolitan " enterprises. 

An examination of the " Annual Register " 
of the University of Chicago reveals the exist- 
ence of a system of educational machinery so 
complex as to bewilder the reader, and fill him 
with a kind of awe at the spectacle of so varied 
an exhibition of miscellaneous activities. Be- 
sides the work proper to a university, there are 
such developments as extension lectures, and 
class - study exercises, and correspondence 
courses, and experimental schools, and affiliated 
schools, and cooperating schools not affiliated, 
and what not. All of these things demand 
much time and energy, and all, however useful 
they may be absolutely, do not seem to com- 



250

[Oct. 16, 



mend themselves as adjuncts of university work. 
Directly or indirectly leading up to degrees, as 
most of these ingenious devices do, one cannot 
escape the suspicion that they somehow lower 
the price that should be paid for university 
honors, and give encouragement to the notion 
that the higher education is not so serious a 
matter after all. There is no harm in sugar- 
coating the pill, but there is harm and grave 
harm in making its contents of homoeopathic 
weakness. We doubt very much if the uni- 
versity credit obtained by students in these col- 
lateral ways represents anything like the equiv- 
alent of the credit to be got by attendance upon 
regular university courses. 

Whether the newest experiment of the Uni- 
versity will prove an unmixed blessing to edu- 
cation in Chicago, is something that remains 
to be seen. But the originality of the plan 
justifies us in giving some account of it, and, 
pending the declaration of results, for which 
we must wait patiently for some years, in per- 
mitting ourselves a few a priori reflections. A 
private benefaction, coupled with an appropri- 
ation by the University itself, has made it pos- 
sible to establish in the heart of Chicago a 
college designed expressly for the education of 
such teachers in the public schools as may feel 
the need of carrying on their scholastic work 
without an interruption of their teaching. The 
faculty of this College for Teachers is selected 
from the faculty of the University proper, and 
includes a number of its ablest men. To meet 
the special needs of its clientele of public-school 
teachers, the hours of instruction are arranged 
for the whole of Saturday and the afternoons 
and evenings of the other week-days. The work 
of this College is planned to fill six months of 
the year, and leads to the baccalaureate degree 
of the University. The unit of work is what 
is technically known as a " major," and con- 
sists of four hours a week for three months. 
Thirty-six of these " majors " are taken as the 
equivalent of the four years of regular univer- 
sity work. Thus, two hours of work daily, 
continued for six years, will make the student 
a graduate of the University, and permit him 
to write after his name the magical letters that 
may mean so little or so much, according to 
the spirit in which his work has been performed. 
A slight reduction from the regular university 
fees is made to teachers who avail themselves 
of these new opportunities. 

The experiment thus outlined is one of great 
interest, and the underlying idea of the plan is 
wholly admirable. In the first place, it empha- 



sizes the fact that education of the academic 
type is the real preparation for successful teach- 
ing, and not the sort of training that is so sadly 
overdone, and so largely futile, in the so-called 
" normal " schools. In the second place, it 
brings instruction of the good type within reach 
of a host of young women comparatively few of 
whom have had any real education of the higher 
sort. There are something like five thousand 
women engaged as teachers in the public 
schools of Chicago, most of whom ended their 
own life as students when they left the high or 
normal school, and some of whom did not so 
much as complete a high-school course. Of 
this number, many, no doubt, have by their 
own efforts gained a discipline quite as good as 
that to be got from college work, and to them 
the cachet of a college degree would now be the 
most meaningless of honors. But there must 
remain many others to whom the new oppor- 
tunity will prove a real boon, and it cannot be 
doubted that this latest educational departure 
of the University was well worth the making. 

On the other hand, there are a few obtrusive 
considerations that cannot be ignored in the 
discussion of this subject, and that must serve 
to temper in some degree the outburst of en- 
thusiasm and sanguine forecast with which the 
new College was dedicated to the public on the 
first of this month. There are the fees, for one 
thing, which must be a serious matter for the 
teachers whom the work will most benefit. For 
it is the younger teachers, whose stipends are 
the smallest, that are chiefly in need of this 
supplementary education ; the older ones, for 
the most part, have either gained the offered 
discipline in other ways, or have lost the plas- 
ticity of mind which must be brought to the 
work of academic education to make it worth 
undertaking. We are inclined to think that it 
would be proper for the Board of Education to 
defray the tuition fees of such of the younger 
teachers as may wish to do this work of self- 
improvement, provided always that this might 
be done without prejudice to the interests of 
those who feel that they have got, or are get- 
ting, in other ways the same sort of educational 
development. This is a delicate question, for 
there are many paths to culture and mental 
discipline, and the one that leads through the 
college may be more direct, but it is no more 
certain of its goal, than the others. What we 
may call the arrogance of the degree is one of 
the worst forms of intellectual snobbery. 

The consideration which does the most, how- 
ever, to make us discount the promise of this 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



251 



experiment, is based upon the fact that neither 
faculty nor students can be expected to do their 
best work under such conditions as are alone 
possible in the new College for Teachers. Col- 
lege work of the best type requires freshness of 
mind on the part of instructor and instructed : 
and this is just what it is impossible to secure 
under the proposed conditions. The teachers 
will be men who are already doing full work in 
the University, and their energies cannot fail 
to flag when it comes to supplementing that 
work by the peculiarly exigent task of con- 
ducting extended class-exercises in the after- 
noon and evening. To say this is merely to 
recognize the essential limitations of human 
strength. Still more must this consideration 
be taken into account with the students, who 
will come to their studies jaded with five hours 
of the most exacting brain labor, labor that 
makes such a demand upon the mental energies 
that it leaves a man and much more a woman 
completely fagged out, and incapable of the 
sort of alert attention and reaction to intellec- 
tual stimulus that is required for college work 
of anything but an inferior type. This rule 
is bound to obtain in the majority of cases, 
although there will doubtless be some excep- 
tions. Bearing these things in mind, then, it 
is useless to hope that the work done by teacher- 
students in the new College will be the real 
equivalent of work done under the proper 
academic conditions. No amount of earnest- 
ness and good-will can make the sluggish mind 
respond as it should to the efforts of the 
instructor, and even these efforts must be made 
sluggish by a similar cause. We believe, in 
short, that the type of education represented by 
the average university extension entertainment 
will tend to be approached in the new institu- 
tion ; and this, useful as it may be, is not the 
sort of thing aimed at, and not the sort of thing 
that the too sanguine forecast of the University 
authorities appears to expect. We do not wish 
to be thought of as throwing any colder water 
than is necessary upon an enterprise planned 
with so admirable a purpose ; but the funda- 
mental facts of human nature have to be faced, 
and they seem to have been at least partly 
ignored in the optimistic deliverances with 
which the work of the new College has just been 
inaugurated. The experiment is, nevertheless, 
of the greatest interest ; and if its promise has 
been somewhat magnified, we still hope for it 
a considerable measure of success, and shall be 
happily disappointed if the results exceed our 
anticipation. 



CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 

This heading may be understood in two ways. 
It may mean the organization of studies, books, 
teaching, and discipline found in one of our cities, 
or the organization of political functions and agents 
that stand behind these educational powers and make 
them possible. The one view brings before us the 
superintendent and his teachers, the other the board 
of education and its administrative organs. The 
first view will find no recognition in this article, 
except that we shall not lose sight of the fact that the 
system in the educational sense is the end for which 
the system in the political or institutional sense ex- 
ists. We might at once say city boards of educa- 
tion, only that we wish to take a broader view of 
the subject than this language would suggest. 

It will be admitted that our subject is now prom- 
inently before the public. The constant criticism 
of existing systems that one hears, and the many 
changes that are made or proposed, point unmistak- 
ably to the strong unrest of the public mind. Crit- 
icisms and plans may differ, but they all lead up to 
the same fact. 

No deep insight is required to enable one to per- 
ceive that these critics and reformers do not always, 
if indeed generally, see their way clearly. They 
wish to improve the schools, and they see clearly 
enough that to accomplish this end the business 
organization must be reformed. So they resort, 
or propose to resort, to the legislature to get the 
system changed, assuming that the evil to be rem- 
edied will be removed by substituting a new board 
of education for the old one. But what is the use 
of taking trouble to get rid of the present board, if 
things are left in such shape that in a few years, if 
not indeed at once, the new board will turn out to 
be as bad as the old one ? It cannot be too strongly 
asserted that the immediate trouble, where there is 
trouble, is with the men who constitute the board. 
If the board consists of good men, you are pretty 
sure in the long run of good administration, regard- 
less of the system. Not that one system is as good 
as another, or that the organization is unimportant. 
This rather is the idea : a system is practically good 
or bad according as it tends to bring the right kind 
of men into the public service and keep them there. 
There may be an exception now and then, here or 
there, but in general this is a safe rule to follow. 
Accordingly, the first question for the reformer to 
ask, as he scans a reform scheme, is not whether 
it is theoretically perfect, or logically consistent 
throughout, but whether, under the conditions ex- 
isting, the scheme will probably accomplish the end 
just stated. Will it bring to the service of the 
schools competent men? 

Having emphasized this point sufficiently, we 
shall next consider the business involved in carrying 
on a system of schools in an American city. Ob- 
viously, there are three functions to be performed, 
one legislative, one executive, and one judicial. 
It would be hard to say whether the legislative 



252 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



function or the executive function is the more im- 
portant of the two ; bat experience shows conclu- 
sively that more evil originates in the organization 
and relations of these two powers than in all other 
parts of the educational machinery put together. 
Let us look into the nature of the mechanism. 

The germ of the American city school board is 
found in the Massachusetts town or township board 
called the Selectmen, which is as old as the Com- 
monwealth. This board originally carried on the 
town schools just as it carried on the other parts of 
the town government, subject, of course, to the ac- 
tion of the General Court and the Town Meeting. 
This board built the schoolhouses, examined and 
employed the teachers, and, together with the min- 
ister of the parish, supervised the schools. In the 
course of time there appeared in the board a com- 
mittee on schools, as there appeared committees on 
other subjects ; and this committee, still further on, 
became detached from the board and assumed a 
separate place in the government of the town. 
Sometimes the members were appointed by the 
Selectmen, and sometimes elected by the Town 
Meeting. Sometimes the committee was dependent 
upon the Selectmen for funds, and sometimes 
directly upon the freemen. But the main fact is 
this : This committee now carried on the schools, 
just as the selectmen has been in the habit of doing. 
It was at once a legislative, executive, and judicial 
body. Such, in substance, is the local school sys- 
tem to-day in the towns and townships where the 
town system of school organization prevails. 

The Massachusetts town school committee, in its 
essential features, became the city school board, or 
board of education, and is still generally found in 
cities without material modification. This committee 
was well enough in the town, and with little change 
it answered the purposes of the city while the city 
remained small ; but when the city became large 
some changes in the organization were found to be 
absolutely necessary. One change was the employ- 
ment of a professional superintendent of the city 
schools, to relieve the board of that responsible 
duty. This proved to be such a decided advantage 
that the small cities and the villages soon followed 
the example. Another change, and this one on the 
business side, was the employment of a salaried 
clerk or secretary, who was not a member of the 
board, to keep the records of the board and to per- 
form other similar business. Sometimes other minor 
changes have been made, but in general the essen- 
tial features of the old organization still remain in 
most of our cities. The board of education is a 
legislative, executive, and judicial body, all in one. 
First, subject to the State law, the board legislates 
on a variety of subjects, as courses of study, rules 
for governing the schools, revenues and appropria- 
tions. Secondly, its field of administration is equally 
large. It appoints teachers, its own clerk and other 
employees, chooses books, provides supplies, builds 
and repairs schoolhouses, and the like. Thirdly, it 
exercises disciplinary powers over pupils, teachers, 



and employees ; but, generally speaking, this latter 
function cuts no great figure. 

The first vice of this scheme is the vesting of the 
legislative and administrative functions in the same 
hands. To be sure, in large cities the board has 
been compelled to divest itself in a considerable 
degree of the administrative work. This it has done, 
rather reluctantly, by creating executive depart- 
ments or offices, as those of finance, instruction, and 
supplies. Now let it be noted, first, that these de- 
partments or offices are the sole creation of the 
board ; and, secondly, that the incumbents are ap- 
pointed by the board and are wholly dependent upon 
it The board can abolish or change departments 
and remove officers at any time. The same may be 
said, for the most part, of the superintendent of 
instruction. Save in a few cities, he has no status 
in the school law ; his office exists at the pleasure 
of the board, and he is elected by the board. The 
only advantage that the superintendent enjoys is that 
he is commonly elected for the term of a year, some- 
times for a longer period, and so cannot be turned 
out of office over-night This is bad enough, but it 
is not the worst Not only has the board imme- 
diate oversight of the executive department, but it 
continues to retain a large body of administrative 
powers in its own hands. These powers it exercises 
directly through its committees. How numerous 
these committees are, a glance into the common 
board manual will show. Generally, there are at 
least enough committees to give every member of 
the board a chairmanship, no matter whether there 
is anything for the committees to do or not 

This system is open to two or three serious ob- 
jections. One is, that the board of education, by 
its very nature and organization, is about as fit to 
do the administrative business of a large system of 
schools as the State legislature or city council is to 
do the executive work of the State or the city. A 
second objection is that the blending of the legisla- 
tive and executive duties opens the door to numer- 
ous abuses. Practiced observers of such matters 
know that this is the source of much of the corrup- 
tion found in school boards. Such observers know 
how eagerly the memberships, and especially the 
chairmanships, of certain committees are sought for 
by a certain class of board members ; for example, 
the committees on construction, repairs, books, and 
supplies. And finally, the system is not in accord 
with the American principle and usage, that large 
legislative and executive powers should not be thus 
mixed together. 

What shall be done to mend matters? The first 
thing to be done is to effect a much greater degree 
of separation than at present between the legislative 
and administrative powers of the system. The princi- 
pal function of the board should be to legislate, while 
administration should be confided, as far as possible, 
to independent administrative officers. The board's 
hands should be taken off from a multitude of things 
that they are now on. The executive officers should 
make reports to the board, furnishing it with infor-

niation and making recommendations ; they should 
be amenable to the board in some process equiva- 
lent to impeachment, but they should derive their 
powers from another source and be responsible in 
another quarter. These remarks of course have no 
reference to the clerk or secretary of the board. At 
the very least, the law should throw around all the 
executive officers of the school system, on both sides, 
safeguards that will protect them against the en- 
croachments of the board. This is the first step that 
needs to be taken in the direction of thoroughgoing 
reform. The new board will have committees, of 
course, but they will be legislative not executive 
committees. 

Nothing that has been said touches the question 
of method. How shall the step just described be 
taken ? This question is an important one, and by 
no means free from difficulty. It is not the purpose 
of this article, however, to enter into details, but to 
insist that school reform in the cities, to be worth 
much or to last long, must be much more thorough 
than simply to produce a new scheme for electing 
board members. Other questions that arise are, 
How large should the board be? How should the 
members be elected? How long should they hold 
their offices ? etc. We have not here space for their 
consideration. 

The question will be asked, How will the plan 
outlined work to bring better men to the service of 
the schools? The question is a fair one, and the 
answer obvious. 

In the first place, a rational business-like plan is 
far more attractive to business-like men than an 
irrational and absurd one. In the second place, if 
the work of the board were practically confined to 
legislation the meetings of the board might be much 
less frequent than they are now, and the amount of 
business to be done reduced in volume. As a result, 
the demands upon the members' time would be re- 
duced and the kind of work to be done be made 
more congenial. Nothing is more likely to disgust 
a real business man than an unbusiness-like pro- 
cedure; and if anything is unbusiness-like it is the 
setting of a city board of education to perform ad- 
ministrative duties, small in themselves but import- 
ant in the aggregate, that proper executive depart- 
ments can perform much better. 

Still, it must be said that no system of itself will 
bring good men into the service ; no matter how 
good the system may be, bad men will get hold of 
it if they are allowed to do so ; but one system ex- 
cels another in tending to produce good men and 
exclude bad ones. R A> HINSDALE.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, October 3, 1898. 

The autumn lists of the publishers are at last prac- 
tically completed. Of them all, that issued by Mr. 
Heinemann looks the most imposing; but whether he 
will publish all he announces this season, is a pertinent 
question. First in this list comes Mr. Savage Landor's 
much-discussed journey in Tibet, which is to be called 
now " In the Forbidden Land." It is to be ready by 
the time this letter reaches you, and will be handsomely 
produced, with all the necessary accessories of illustra- 
tions, maps, and plans. Its price, however, is to be 
pretty high, and this must be put down to the large 
amount paid to the author for his manuscript. A novel 
title for an old-fashioned series is that given by Mr. 
Heinemann, or its editor, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, to the 
twelve volumes which are to deal with the various im- 
portant divisions of the world. It is to be called " A 
View of the World in 1900," and will consist of the 
following works: " Britain and the North Atlantic," by 
the editor; "Scandinavia and the Arctic Ocean," by 
Sir C. R. Markham; " The Mediterranean and France," 
by M. Elise'e Reclus; " Central Europe," by Dr. Joseph 
Partsch; " Africa," by Dr. J. Scott Keltie; "The Near 
East," by D. G. Hogarth; "The Russian Empire," by 
Prince Kropotkin; "The Far East," by Mr. Archibald 
Little; "India," by Col. Sir Thomas Holdich; "Aus- 
tralasia and Antarctica," by Dr. H. O. Forbes; and 
" North and South America," by authorities from your 
side of the water. Of the " Literatures of the World" 
series you have already heard last season; and the same 
may be said for the " Great Educators." In fiction, 
we are promised "The Two Magics," by Mr. Henry 
James; "Tony Drum," by Mr. Edwin Pugh; "Gloria 
Mundi," by Mr. Harold Frederic; " Red Rock," by Mr. 
T. N. Page; "The Widower," by Mr. W. E. Norris; 
and new stories by Mr. Stephen Crane, Mrs. F. A. Steel, 
and Mr. Robert Hichens. An important announcement 
is the translations of all Gabriele d'Annunzio's novels. 
The series of articles which the editor of " The Satur- 
day Review " has, during the past few months, been 
writing for his journal, are to be included in a volume, 
and published with the title " The Man William Shake- 
speare." 

You may already have had almost enough of the 
newspaper talk of Captain Dreyfus and his "affaire" 
and the supposed part M. le Commandant Esterhazy 
has played in it. But all that you have heard is nothing 
to what you will read in Esterhazy's own account which 
Mr. Grant Richards will publish here on the first of Nov- 
ember. I need hardly tell you that what has already 
appeared in print is largely made up of conjecture ; and 
I speak from personal acquaintance with the syllabus of 
contents of the coming story, when I tell you that it will 
be well worth reading. An American publisher has 
already secured the copyright for the States, and the 
work will be published simultaneously here and on your 
side. 

A considerable number of the " announced " books 
have already appeared. Dr. Busch's ponderous tomes on 
Bismarck, which were ushered in with a mighty pother 
of advertisements and newspaper reviews, are settling 
themselves quietly on the shelves of our subscription 
libraries. Those who care for Bismarck and his doings 
will now look for his personal " Reflections and Recol- 
lections " which the Cotta publishing house of Stuttgart 



254 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



is preparing. The manuscript of this work, I under- 
stand, was corrected by Bismarck himself; but it is to 
be issued under the care of Dr. Uorst Khol, and the 
first part will be ready in November. In Germany, Dr. 
Busch's work has been condemned, not so much for any 
indiscreet revelations he made as for the actual histor- 
ical value of what he said. Mr. Merriman's " Roden's 
Corner " is another of the expected which has arrived. 
It is proving but a succe d'estime, and critics are agreed 
in considering it a falling-off from that writer's previous 
work. On the other hand, Mr. Neil Munro's " John 
Splendid " is likely to be the novel of the year. Another 
story which is attracting very much attention is " Phases 
of an Inferior Planet," by Ellen Glasgow; it is an exceed- 
ingly striking book. If you want to enjoy an excellent 
piece of biographical study, you should read Mr. 
Augustine Bin-ell's sketch of Sir Frank Lockwood. It 
is full of good things and most racily told. 

Before I forget it, let me mention that Mr. S. R. 
Crockett will be again to the fore, on October 17, with 
" The Red Axe " another of his regulation yarns. So 
will be Mr. Stanley Weyman with " The Castle Inn," a 
story which has been running its serial course in " The 
Cornhill Magazine." Mr. Weyman's book, however, 
will not be published until the first of November. Mr. 
Kipling's new volume of short stories will already be 
out by the time this letter reaches you; I understand that 
it will also form the thirteenth volume of the edition de 
luxe of his collected works. 

Shelleyites have for many years searched in vain for 
a volume of M Original Poetry, by Victor and Cazire." 
Since 1860, when Dr. Richard Garnett first informed 
the world that such a volume was once printed, collect- 
ors have searched high and low for it. Now, at last, a 
copy has turned up, and a facsimile reprint of it will 
be issued by Mr. John Lane. It was in last October 
that Mr. Lane received a letter from Mr. V. . G. 
Hussey, of Dorchester, asking him if he would be inclined 
to undertake " the republication of some early original 
poems by Shelley, of which my mother, Mrs. J. F. 
Hussey, is in possession. . . . The work in question is 
entitled 'Original Poetry, by Victor and Cazire,' the 
production of P. B. Shelley and an anonymous collab- 
orator. The book was published at Horsham in 1810, 
and consists of about sixty octavo pages." In Dr. Gar- 
nett's opinion the collaborator was Elizabeth, Shelley's 
sister. It is interesting to learn that Mrs. Hussey's 
father was the Rev. Charles Henry Grove, brother to 
Harriet Grove, Shelley's first sweetheart. Of the work 
itself, not much is expected; but everybody interested 
in English poetry will be curious to know its contents. 
It seems that Shelley, in order to extricate himself from 
the Horsham printer's debt, went to Stockdale, a dealer 
in " remainders," and arranged with him to take over the 
remaining copies, 1480 in number, in liquidation of the 
s 11 in owing. This was done, but Stockdale afterwards 
found a poem in the collection which he knew to be by 
" Monk " Lewis, and wrote to Shelley about it. Shelley, 
according to Stockdale's own account of the matter, ex- 
pressed the " warmest resentment at the imposition 
practiced upon him by his coadjutor, and entreated me 
to destroy all the copies, of which about one hundred 
had been put in circulation." This was in 1810, and 
now the only copy known is this of Mrs. Hussey's. 

I hear that Mr. William Watson is about to change 
bis publishers once again his collected works are to 
be issued in two volumes by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., 
and that for the present he is to devote himself to 



prose, to the writing of literary criticisms and critical 
essays. 

The new edition of " Pepys* Diary," upon which Mr. 
H. B. Wheatley has been engaged for so long a time, is 
to be finally completed in January next by the addition 
of a ninth volume of Index, and a tenth entitled " Pepys- 
iana." This last volume is to contain notes and illus- 
trations of Pepys' life and Diary, and various appendices 
explanatory of the man and his times. 

The new edition of Carlyle's " Sartor Resartus," with 
illustrations, to the number of over one hundred, by 
Mr. E. J. Sullivan, will, I am sure, prove a very agree- 
able surprise. The pictures are the cleverest things I 
have seen for many a day. The book will not be ready 
before the end of the month. TEMPLE SCOTT. 



OOMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE FOUNDING OF FREE GOVERNMENT 

IN AMERICA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Professor B. A. Hinsdale, in his very kind review of 
my work, " The First Republic in America," in THE 
DIAL, Sept. 16, 1898, says: 

" Mr. Brown's theory is that Smith and the King: were vir- 
tually in collusion ; that his accounts of things in Virginia 
forwarded the royal purpose ; while the destruction of one 
part of the Company's record and the long concealment of 
another part left Smith's accounts mainly unchallenged. On 
this point we are bound to think the author has been some- 
what carried away by his enthusiasm for the Company and 
his detestation of Smith." 

James I. allowed the royal portraits to be engraved 
on the title-page of Smith's history, and permitted the 
author to present him with a copy of his history through 
the hands of the Duchess of Richmond and Lenox, who 
was then aspiring to the hand of the King (pp. 635, 
636). I do not believe that such royal endorsements 
as these acts imply would have been made if the account 
as written had not forwarded the royal purpose; but, 
further than this, I have no theory of collusion between 
the King and Smith, and I am sorry to have produced 
such an impression. The matter is of too great historic 
importance to be misunderstood, and I wish to state the 
facts of the case more clearly. 

I. The press was under the control of the Crown. 
If any history had contained an account of anything in 
Virginia which did not forward the King's purpose, the 
item or items would have been censored and erased 
before the book could have been licensed. Smith's his- 
tory as licensed and published contains no such matter; 
it conforms in all important particulars to the royal pur- 
pose as outlined in the verdict of the royal commission- 
ers (pp. 541, 542). 

II. The Company records were taken possession of 
by order of the Crown, and were so completely concealed 
forever thereafter that, so far as I can learn, not a 
single one of them has ever been found. Save for the 
forethought of Arthur Wodenoth, John Ferrar, Nicholas 
Ferrer, Sir John Danvers, and a few other patriots 
(who feared that the records would be destroyed), and 
save for the providential preservation of sundry extras 
and copies of documents in Spain, France, the Neth- 
erlands, and in several private collections the truth 
as to the founding of a more free government in Amer- 
ica, the origin of this nation, would have been consigned 



1898.

by the advocates of a royal monarchy forever to oblivion. 
That James I. endeavored to suppress the true his- 
tory of the great popular movement which gave birth 
to this nation is as well established as such a fact could 
well be. That the Crown concealed the Company rec- 
ords, and had accounts published which conveyed false 
ideas, is certain ; and it is of the greatest historic import- 
ance that this fact should be well understood.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ORIENT. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The reviewer of Mr. Colquhoun's " China in Trans- 
formation," in your issue of Sept. 16, placidly assumes 
that to " transform Cathay into a vast hive of multifari- 
ous industry " through the process of making it " covet " 
a thousand things of which it now knows nothing, and 
which the few attain through the toil and enslavement of 
the many, is to bestow upon it an unmixed blessing. 
Permit me to say that we Orientals think otherwise. 
We dread the contagion of your unrest. We love that 
" Sleep of Centuries " from which you desire to awaken 
us, for its dreams are sweet and its pillow is content- 
ment. We abhor that idol of progress which you would 
roll through our ancient civilizations like a Juggernaut; 
for progress means change, and the parent of change is 
discontent, and discontent is the negation of happiness. 
Your view of the world as a mere workshop, and of the 
elements of the universe as primarily the raw material 
of the " wealth " of traffic, we do not understand. We 
reverence what you despise the old; and our ears are 
open to the oracles of sages who spoke in the dawn of 
days, and closed to the passing babble of venders of 
novelties. Your mania of " improvement " is a puzzle 
to us. How well and wisely, to our view, spoke that 
deputation of senators to the great Napoleon, after the 
fever of revolution had burned itself out in the veins of 
exhausted France: "Sire, the worst malady that can 
torment the human race is the desire of perfection." 
We are the East, you are the West. Our view is not 
your view, for our eyes are not your eyes. The life of 
the Orient, which to you seems a stagnant pool choked 
with weeds and foul with the rotting growth of centuries, 
seems to us a broad and tranquil river, starred with the 
lotos, and flowing into the slumbrous sea of eternity.

AFTER THE SONNETS OF SHAKESPEARE. 

Thus wrote the master, so prefiguring 

The constant service of one faithful heart: 

Her silent lay let lyric Shakespeare sing, 

Nor deem my love less tuneful than his art. 

Nay, think of him but as the interpreter 

Of the sacred hieroglyphics of the soul, 

Love's Druid, with his runic staves writ o'er 

With mystic legends that all hearts control. 

His songs are dateless, after as before: 

They register the passions that rejoice 

Or plague men ever; they are music's score, 

Waiting the player's hand, the singer's voice. 

Love's voice and hand, sweet Love, amend the song, 

Lest even his singing love's sweet music wrong.

BISMARCK AND HIS BOSWEI/L.* 



Bismarck probably had, as he often professed 
to have, a sovereign contempt for newspapers. 
In fact, there would seem to have been few things 
or men in the world he moved in for which or 
for whom he had not more or less contempt. 
But he was always cynically indifferent as to the 
general character of the tools he used, provided 
only they were useful ; and it is now clear that 
in point of fact no statesman of his time 
" worked the press " more assiduously or less 
scrupulously than did this professed despiser of 
journalism. When the full history of his great 
political achievement comes to be written it will 
be seen that a third ingredient, printers' ink, 
will have to be added to his celebrated formula 
of " Blood and Iron " in order to make it a 
true summary of the means employed in the 
carrying through of the Bismarckian policy in 
Germany. It is hardly too much to say, as a 
recent competent witness f has shown, that the 
great Chancellor was himself in effect a jour- 
nalist a virtual member of the fraternity he 
used to style in his pleasant way, " quill-cattle." 
He was a busy writer of political leaders long 
before he went prominently into administrative 
office. His journalistic career was in full swing 
in 1848, and it lasted with scarcely a break to 
the day of his death a half-century later. Dur- 
ing the twenty odd years of his chancellorship 
he virtually " ran " the influential press of Ger- 
many. His monopoly of official news, his com- 
mand of the " reptile fund," and his organized 
corps of press writers and " workers," enabled 
him to do this. His dismissal from office in 
1890 by no means checked his journalistic ac- 
tivity, though it materially narrowed its area. 
Of the five hundred " organs " which he con- 
trolled while in power, one only, the Ham- 
burger NachricJiten, stood by him after his 
fall ; and a great portion of his not very dig- 
nified retirement at Friedrichsruhe was spent in 
concocting well-spiced matter for this faithful 
sheet. Usually the Bismarckian articles in the 
Hamburg paper were of the " inspired " variety, 
discreetly softened and diluted to the degree 
dictated by editorial prudence. But sometimes

the angry old Junker seized the pen himself ; 
and then the soul of Editor Hofmann trembled. 

The Press Bureau in the Wilhelmstrasse is 
an important and recognized branch of the 
German Foreign Office, and under Bismarck 
especially it became a potent engine for manip- 
ulating public opinion. Of the well-organized 
corps of salaried scribes and emissaries em- 
ployed on the Bureau in Bismarck's time, there 
was no member who more fully enjoyed the 
confidence of his chief than Dr. Moritz Busch, 
the author of the two remarkable volumes now 
before us. Dr. Busch entered the Bureau in 
February, 1870, and he soon displayed such 
shining aptitude for its duties that his advance- 
ment in favor was rapid. He followed the 
Chancellor to the war in August, and was with 
him at Metz, Sedan, and Versailles. After 
peace was concluded he returned with him to 
Berlin, and resumed his round of journalistic 
duties, acting as the Chancellor's special liter- 
ary henchman and man-of-all-work up to the 
date of his patron's dismissal from office in 
1890. After that date his intercourse with 
Bismarck was more desultory ; but he was up 
to the last a frequent and favored visitor at 
Friedrichsruhe, and his really Boswellian ac- 
count of these visits and of his confidential 
chats with the deposed statesman, whose natural 
venom towards the objects of his dislike or 
jealousy increased with ripening years, forms 
not the least racy and interesting portion of his 
book. 

Of Dr. Busch's unsparing, let us add fatal, 
veracity there can be no question. That is his 
crowning, and, under the circumstances, singu- 
lar merit. " Once I am dead," Bismarck said 
to him in 1879, " you can tell everything you 
like, absolutely everything you know "; and the 
Doctor took him at his word in a way that 
must have made even the Iron Chancellor 
wince, could he have seen the result. As we 
have already shown, Dr. Busch's official rela- 
tions with Bismarck were such as to enable him 
to unveil completely the least creditable phase 
of his patron's statecraft his dealings with 
the press. His was usually the hand employed 
to let fly the poisoned shaft shot in the dark- 
ness ; he was the trusted go-between who se- 
cured for an occasion the venal columns of the 
influential but unofficial journal ; or who, when 
the work in hand was too dirty or dangerous 
for a decent paper to touch, hired the services 
of " some obscure, disreputable sheet" ("irgend 
ein entfemtes Schandblatt"). " Morality," Bis- 
marck used to say, "has absolutely nothing 



to do with the business of politics "; and that 
this axiom was with him no mere hardy flour- 
ish of cynical paradox, the tale of his relations 
with journalism, as told by his literary facto- 
tum, amply shows. We cannot enter into the 
tortuous details of this story here. The nar- 
rator tells it apparently with the most naive 
unconsciousness that he is degrading for all 
time the memory of the man he worshipped. 
In this regard Dr. Busch is unique among 
biographers. His blindness to the ludicrous dis- 
crepancy between his idolatrous attitude toward 
his hero, and the squalid truths he tells of him, 
is not the least remarkable thing about his 
book. He is like the lover who mingled rap- 
turous apostrophes to his mistress with a start- 
ling catalogue of her personal defects. Perhaps 
Dr. Busch means to prove the depth and sin- 
cerity of his devotion by showing us the obsta- 
cles it could overcome ; but at all events, his 
readers cannot fail to wonder at him as he goes 
on placidly enumerating instance after instance 
of his hero's duplicity and brutality, and then 
unctuously tells how he used to address him to 
his face as " Mein Heiland " (my Savior) and 
My Messiah." Once he is not ashamed to 
compare the unscrupulous old minister, looking 
back on his political achievements, to " God 
the Father on the seventh day regarding the 
world he had made " ! 

Naturally, the course of Dr. Busch's devo- 
tion to Bismarck did not always run smoothly. 
Sometimes he was roughly snubbed by the big 
man for instance, at the battle of Sedan, 
when, a movement of the troops being under 
discussion, he rashly ventured a mild strate- 
gical suggestion of his own. But in general 
he was decently and even civilly treated ; and 
to his credit be it said that he clung to the 
heels of his imperious master with dog-like 
fidelity, through sunshine and shade, till the 
end. Occasional scraps of gruff praise that were 
tossed to him he received with joy and records 
with pride. "Bilschlein" (little Busch) was the 
friendly diminutive the Chancellor latterly 
came to call him by. When the big man was 
angry, "Buschlein's " attitude was humble and 
conciliatory as we judge, like that of Sterne's 
donkey, whose look seemed to say, " Do n't beat 
me, but if you will you may." That this meek- 
ness of bearing toward his Chief was not due 
to a lack of spirit, or of personal courage in 
general, is plain. Dr. Busch shows himself in 
his book the fearless and outspoken partisan 
of Bismarck ; and if we are not much mistaken 
there is more than one passage in the closing 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

chapters, wherein he grows warm over the griev- 
ances of the exile of Friedrichsruhe, that may 
yet cost him dear say a twelvemonth in jail 
for Majestatsbeleidigung. Once, in a transport 
of nettled partisanship, he does not scruple to 
sneer pointedly and on his own account at the 
" narrow and mediocre mind " of the Conse- 
crated One himself ! We tremble for Dr. 
Busch. 

As was to be expected, the book abounds in 
quotable passages is made up of them, one 
may almost say. To convey here by examples 
anything like a fair notion of its richness in 
this regard is out of the question. A good story 
illustrative of the Chancellor's rather malicious 
humor, and of his habit of poking fun at qual- 
ities he was pleased to term " professorial," is 
that told by him of Humboldt. Bismarck said : 

" Under the late King I was the sole victim when 
Humboldt chose to entertain the company in his own 
style. He usually read, often for hours at a time, the 
biography of some French savant or architect in whom 
nobody in the world but himself took the slightest inter- 
est. He stood by the lamp holding the paper close to 
the light, and occasionally paused to make some learned 
observation. Although nobody listened to him, he had 
the ear of the house. The Queen was all the time at 
work on a piece of tapestry, and certainly did not under- 
stand a word of what he said. The King looked through 
his portfolio of engravings, turning them over as noisily 
as possible, evidently with the intention of not hearing 
him. The young people in the background enjoyed 
themselves without the least restraint, so that their 
cackling and giggling actually drowned his reading, 
which, however, rippled on without break or stop, like 
a brook. Gerlach, who was usually present, sat on his 
small round chair, which could barely accommodate his 
voluminous person, and slept so soundly that he snored. 
The King was once obliged to wake him, and said, ' Pray, 
Gerlach, do n't snore so loud ! ' I was Humboldt's only 
listener, that is to say, I sat still and pretended to listen, 
at the same time following my own thoughts, until at 
length cold cake and white wine were served. It put 
the old gentleman in very bad humor not to have all the 
talk to himself. I remember once there was somebody 
there who managed to monopolize the conversation 
quite naturally, it is true, as he was a clever raconteur 
and spoke about things that interested everybody. Hum- 
boldt was beside himself. In a peevish, surly temper, 
he piled his plate so high [pointing with his hand] with 
pate de foie gras, fat eels, lobsters' tails, and other indi- 
gestible stuff a real mountain it was astounding 
that an old man could put it all away. At last his pa- 
tience was exhausted, and he could not stand it any 
longer. So he tried to interrupt the speaker. ' On the 
peak of Popocatapetl,' he began, but the other went 
on with his story. ' On the peak of Popocatapetl, seven 
thousand fathoms above,' but he again failed to make 
any impression and the narrative of the other maintained 
its easy flow. On the peak of Popocatapetl, seven thou- 
sand fathoms above the level of the sea,' he exclaimed 
in a loud and excited tone, but with as little success 
as before. The talker talked on, and the company had 
no ears for anybody else. That was something unheard 



of, outrageous ! Humboldt threw himself back in morose 
meditation over the ingratitude of mankind, and shortly 
afterwards left." 

Dr. Busch records many uncomplimentary 
things said by Bismarck of foreigners, espe- 
cially the French and the English. To Amer- 
icans he was partial thanks, perhaps, to his 
intimacy with Motley. Bancroft, too, he par- 
ticularly esteemed, pronouncing him a model 
diplomat. Napoleon III. he flatly styled " a 
muddle-headed fellow," and he had a poor 
opinion of Gladstone "Professor Gladstone," 
he ironically styled him. France, he observed 
in 1870, " is a nation of ciphers a mere herd." 

" The French are wealthy and elegant, but they have 
no individuality, no consciousness as individuals, but 
only as a mass. They are like thirty million obedient 
Kaffirs, each one of whom is in himself featureless and 
worthless, not fit to be compared with Russians and 
Italians, to say nothing of ourselves. You can give a 
Frenchman twenty-five lashes, and if you only make a 
fair speech to him about the freedom and dignity of 
man of which those lashes are the expression, and at the 
same time strike a fitting attitude, he will persuade 
himself that he is not being thrashed. ... If you peel 
the white hide off a Gaul you will find a Turco under it." 

Comparing the Latin with the Germanic 
races, in 1871, Bismarck was drawn into some 
interesting general observations. 

" The Germanic race is, so to speak, the male prin- 
ciple throughout Europe the fructifying principle. 
The Celtic and Slav peoples represent the female sex. 
That principle extends as far as the North Sea and then 
across to England.' I ventured to add [says Dr. Busch], 
and also as far as America and the Western States of 
the Union, where some of our people form the best part 
of the population and influence the manners of the rest. 
Yes,' he replied, 'those are their children, the fruit 
they bear. That was to be seen in France while the 
Franks still had the upper hand. The Revolution of 
1789 was the overthrow of the Germanic element by the 
Celtic. And what have we seen since then ? And this 
held good in Spain so long as the Gothic blood pre- 
dominated. And also in Italy, when in the north the 
Germans also played a leading part. When that ele- 
ment exhausted itself, there was nothing decent left." 

Dr. Busch's pages are well salted with pithy 
and characteristic Bismarckiana. " I am of 
opinion," he once said, "that to prevent mis- 
chief the Jews will have to be rendered innoc- 
uous by cross-breeding." Discussing projects 
for State aid to the poor, he asked : " Why 
should those who have in battle become inca- 
pable of earning a livelihood be entitled to a 
pension, and not also the rank and file of the 
army of labor ?" " The kindlier affections," 
he averred, " have as little place in the calcu- 
lations of politics as in those of trade." 

But we must take leave of Dr. Busch's ex- 
tremely interesting memoir. Its basis, it should 
be added, is a diary ranging over the twenty

odd years of the author's intercourse with Bis- 
marck, the conversational portions of which 
were in most cases jotted down within an hour 
after the words recorded were spoken. That 
Bismarck was aware of his Boswell, and ap- 
proved of his proceedings, is clear. " Biisch- 
l>ln," he remarked in 1891, " will one day long 
after my death write the secret history of our 
time from the best sources of information." 
Dr. Busch's " secret history," as we now have 
it, does not tend to enhance our admiration, 
still less our liking, for the puissant Chancellor. 
But its author has rendered a great service to 
the cause of impartial truth. His book is, in 
its class, of the very first importance the one 
book of the season that the student of our cen- 
tury's political history should read, whatever 
else be neglected. The volumes are handsomely 
made and they contain some striking and well 
executed portraits ; but we must complain of 
the very insufficient index.

FIRST OF THK WAR HISTORIES.* 

The first of the war histories, the leaves of 
which are soon to be as those of Vallambrosa 
for multitude, is upon us in the form of advance 
sheets of " The Fall of Santiago." This record 
flows from the facile pen of Mr. Thomas J. 
Vivian, whom his title-page announces as the 
author of " With Dewey at Manilla." It pays 
the penalty of its timeliness by cumulative evi- 
dences of haste in letter-press, illustrations, and 
proof-reading. It also appears to be rather the 
raw material of history than history itself. 

Possibly the first thought which the book 
induces is one of satiety. We are desperately 
tired of the war and its malarial atmosphere ; 
and, after all the praise poured upon us by 
critics of more or less competence for our fight- 
ing, and the dispraise we seem to be heaping 
upon ourselves for nearly everything else, it 
requires something strong, either by way of 
flattery or objurgation, to rouse our jaded intel- 
lects. Such being the fact, the faults of this 
book are doubtless more prominent than they 
will appear to be in the ensuing years. A style 
which is as of that of the newspapers, though 
without the advantage these possess of careful 
copy-reading before publication, is the most 
apparent of these. Next come the pictures, 
some of them the ordinary process cuts of mod- 
ern journals, others half-tone reproductions of

York : R. F. Fenno & Co. 



the admirable photographs done for Mr. W. R. 
Hearst, but neither of them quite suited for 
serious history. So much for manner. 

A digression may be pardoned in respect of 
the original sources of information which have 
been at the historian's disposal here. Aside 
from the official reports, many of them avail- 
able through the daily press, the war corre- 
spondents themselves seem to speak with the 
highest authority, due to their having been eye- 
witnesses of nearly all the facts to be chronicled. 
And for this we are largely indebted to the so- 
called " yellow journals." Whatever else these 
deleterious adjuncts of our civilization may be, 
they are not parsimonious in their expenditures 
for news. When their arrangements for giving 
the people of the United States the last infor- 
mation from the seat of hostilities had been 
completed, it was found that they had sent to 
the front men of approved skill as writers and 
pictorial artists in such profusion that all the 
papers, whether daily or weekly and whatever 
their color, must engage themselves in similar 
extravagance or be hopelessly behind in the 
purveying of news. This has made the war one 
of correspondents in good part ; and there is 
no doubt that there were so many of them that 
they would have become an insufferable nui- 
sance had they not developed the most versatile 
talents as warriors, scouts, nurses, and every- 
thing else that brave men can be. What news- 
paper men have long known has now been 
demonstrated to the world at large : that the 
papers are able to command a service which for 
absolute devotion to the duty before them ranks 
next to that called forth by patriotism. 

But, owing to the censorship, this service was 
uneven. Up to the fall of Santiago, which covers 
the entire time allotted to the book in hand, the 
telegraphed reports were not particularly full 
or satisfactory in any respect, while all their 
deficiencies were more than made up, except in 
point of mere timeliness, by long and well- 
written letters transmitted through the mails 
for the purpose of avoiding the censorship. 
After the fall of Santiago, especially during the 
operations in Puerto Rico (the official spelling, 
and a deplorable one), the censor was dismissed, 
and in consequence the telegraphic reports were 
much more detailed and were not supplemented 
by the still better letters of the weeks before. 

Another source, which could have been de- 
pended upon in former wars to a much greater 
extent, is found in private letters written by 
the soldiers and sailors. These overflowed the 
papers, and have proved to be curiously un- 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

trustworthy in many instances. One of these 
may be cited from the book before us, where 
the credit of being first to descry the approach 
of Cervera's squadron when opening the battle 
of July the third off Santiago is awarded to a 
young man whose chief claim to the honor lies 
in the fact that he wrote home and told them 
there that he did it : at least, a letter addressed 
to his captain, Evans, of the Iowa, elicited the 
reply that neither he nor anyone else on board 
the battleship had been awarded the prize men- 
tioned for his alleged vigilance, that no such 
prize had been offered, and that the article of 
discovery was in any event rather joint than 
several. A number of similar incidents might 
be given here if they were of any applicability. 

It will be observed that all these sources are 
exclusively American, and that history, like so 
many other things, has two sides to it. In the 
book now written by Mr. Vivian this lack is 
quite apparent. Some of the messages of the 
Spanish generals appear in the wonderful trans- 
lations that lead a reader to infer that the 
United States had no Spanish scholars in all 
their broad domain. The log-book of the 
" Colon " has been drawn upon, with excellent 
results. But, generally speaking, the Spanish 
are not given the credit they deserve for their 
courage in the fighting about Santiago, though 
it is to be feared it was the miserable slanders 
respecting American cruelty rather than char- 
acter which sustained them. Other defects 
follow from lack of information from the ene- 
my's camp. 

There is a commendable frankness in Mr. 
Vivian 's account of the taking of Santiago which 
we trust will prevent the annals of the Hispano- 
American war being disfigured with the gross 
inaccuracies that characterize the histories of 
the land operations during the War of 1812. 
The larger it is writ that politics is not suited 
to field operations, and that, however necessary 
trained soldiers may be found in times of peace, 
they are still more essential in periods of war, 
the surer the nation will be enabled to avoid 
the drubbing otherwise in store for it at the 
hands of some enemy in future. However 
mortifying to our sense of pride, the truth will 
make us free : an observation which makes an 
appeal to statesmen, and none whatever to mere 
politicians. 

Among minor defects in Mr. Vivian's work, 
the use of types which lack the Spanish diacrit- 
ical marks is most annoying. The Spanish 
spelling is more nearly orthoepic than any other 
in Europe. Any deviations from the two sim- 



ple rules of accent are indicated. " N " with 
and " n " without the circumflex are different 
letters. Here, not even the cedilla is used for 
the " c " soft before " a," o," and " u." Surely 
it is not asking too much of the linotype to have 
these additional types provided. What is chiefly 
commendable in the book is a certain pictur- 
esqueness and vehemence that carry the narra- 
tive over many discouragements ; while the 
facts are in the main closely adhered to, as we 
understand them. WALLACE RICE. 



ORIENTALIST, TRAVELLER, AND 
DIPLOMAT.* 

Besides the interest which every scholar must 
feel in Sir Henry Rawlinson as the Champol- 
lion of cuneiform decipherment, the general 
reader cannot fail to find entertainment as well 
as instruction in Canon Rawlinson's account of 
his brother's long life covering the years 
from 1810 to 1895 which was devoted as 
much to travel, adventure, and military and 
diplomatic service, as to philological and geo- 
graphical research. 

He seems to have been a second, or rather 
an earlier, Sir Richard Burton, in his love of 
adventure spiced with danger, and in the facil- 
ity with which he acquired the languages of 
the East. The sacred city of Kutn and the 
renowned shrine of Fatima, said never to have 
been entered by a European, possessed attrac- 
tions for him, when he was serving as a young 
lieutenant in Persia, too great to be resisted. 
Instant death menaced the audacious infidel 
who should be discovered intruding upon the 
holy precincts, and it was only by assuming 
the disguise of a Persian Pilgrim that the young 
Englishman gained admission to the temple. 

" The guardian gave him the customary form of words, 
and he repeated them; but shortly afterwards his eye 
was attracted by some magnificent suits of steel armour 
which hung upon the walls, and be found with a thrill 
of alarm, that while curiously contemplating them and 
speculating upon their age and origin, he had almost 
turned his back upon the sacred spot where the saint 
lay the cynosure of all the eyes of 'true believers.' 
Fortunately for him, his lapse was not remarked it 
had been little more than momentary otherwise, in 
all probability, a promising career would then and there 
have been cut short, and a light lost to philological, 
geographical, and diplomatic science with which they 
could ill have afforded to dispense."

a novel road race ridden by him in India in 
1832 shows still farther the spirit and nerve 
of the young man. He rode, with an occasional 
change of mounts, from Poonah to Panwell, 
seventy-two miles, for a stake of one hundred 
pounds. The wager required him, in order to 
w \n, to cover the distance in four hours one 
hundred rupees to be forfeited by him for every 
minute over that time, and the same amount to 
be paid to him for every minute saved. After 
several mishaps and hairbreadth escapes, the 
rider reached his goal, fifty-three minutes ahead 
of time ! In this connection two other instances 
of narrow escape from death may be noted. On 
one occasion he was descending the Tigris on a 
raft, when he and his attendants were attacked 
by a band of Arabs, who opened fire on them 
from the bank. Rawlinson chanced to be writ- 
ing at the time, and was holding the ink-bottle 
in his left hand, when a bullet struck it from 
between his fingers. One of his escort was 
killed, and he only prevented farther loss by 
landing with a few men and driving off the 
assailants. Some years later, during his resi- 
dence at Candahar as political agent, at the 
time of the great Affghan War, he barely es- 
caped assassination by a lucky accident. For 
three successive days he was detained in the 
courthouse dispensing justice to all complain- 
ants, much beyond his usual hour of leaving, 
and was thus prevented from taking his cus- 
tomary evening ride. A fanatic one of a 
band of forty who had sworn on the Koran to 
accomplish the assassination of the Great Fer- 
inghee, as Rawlinson was called lay in wait 
for him for three evenings where he was wont to 
mount his horse, having pledged himself neither 
to eat nor drink until he had done the deed. 
On the third evening, as the Great Feringhee 
still failed to appear and the would-be murderer 
was nearly crazed with thirst, he was forced to 
content himself with stabbing the secretary of 
his intended victim, whereupon he was imme- 
diately arrested and taken before the latter to 
receive sentence of death. 

Such indications of a hardy and daring tem- 
perament gain an added significance when we 
turn to consider Rawlinson's achievements as 
a geographical explorer and a discoverer of 
cuneiform inscriptions. The trilingual inscrip- 
tion on the great rock of Behistun the 
Rosetta Stone of cuneiform decipherment 
would never have yielded up its secret to a man 
of less physical activity and persistency of pur- 
pose. Nor could the geography of certain dis- 
tricts of interior Asia, over which he travelled, 



have been mastered by one of a less adventur- 
ous and daring nature. The Journals of the 
Royal Asiatic Society and of the Royal Geo- 
graphical Society, of fifty and sixty years ago, 
bear record of the young explorer's achieve- 
ments. 

The zenith of Rawlinson's career as a dip- 
lomat was reached in 1859, when he was ap- 
pointed Ambassador to the Persian court. His 
long residence in Persia, his personal friend- 
ship with the Shah, and his familiarity with 
the language and customs of the country, made 
his nomination a happy one, although events 
beyond his control caused him to resign his 
office only six months after entering upon it. 

The remainder of his life was passed in En- 
gland, as a member of Parliament, a student 
of and writer on cuneiform inscriptions and 
oriental antiquities, a trustee of the British 
Museum, a life member of the India Council, 
member and president of the Royal Geograph- 
ical Society, and contributor of scientific and 
political articles to various publications. It is 
interesting to learn that his favorite poem, and 
one which he often repeated in later life, was 
Longfellow's " The Day is Done "; and also 
that as early as 1857 he was given the degree 
of LL.D. by Dartmouth College. 

The life of this distinguished Orientalist, as 
told by his younger brother and ardent admirer, 
certainly loses nothing in the telling. It is 
sympathetic, and inspires the reader with some- 
thing of its author's love of his theme. But 
why must the Canon drag his favorite Hero- 
dotus into the body of his text, untranslated at 
that however brief the quotation ? And is 
it not a bit of unnecessary pedantry to use the 
verb desiderate instead of desire or want ? The 
chapter on personal characteristics, by the 
present Sir Henry Rawlinson, adds much to 
the warm human interest of the book, but con- 
tains one note jarring to American ears. In 
referring to his father's scrupulous care, as a 
public servant of her Majesty, to avoid en- 
gaging in any commercial enterprise or even 
lending his name to the promotion of such enter- 
prise, the writer says : " We have been drifting 
lately nearer, perhaps too near, to the system of 
financial morality prevalent on the other side 
of the Atlantic." However, we may be allowed 
to take our revenge in a harmless smile at Sir 
Henry's mixing of metaphors when he adds : 
Let us hope that our drifting . . . may ere 
long be turned into the straight and upright 
channel."

RECENT PEDAGOGICAL. LITERATURE.* 



For a third of a century Dr. W. T. Harris has 
been contributing generously to the growing educa- 
tional literature of the country addresses, articles, 
papers, lectures, prefaces, introductions, reports, 
" discussions," etc., contributions rich in the fruits 
of reading, thought, and experience. Still, until 
now there has been no one work that could be said 
to present in one view the essential features of his 
system of educational thought. To arrive at such 
a view, the student must consult many scattered 
publications and make a synthesis of his own. This 
situation was the more remarkable because Dr. 
Harris has stood for years, by common consent, as 
the foremost pedagogical thinker and the highest 
educational authority of the country. The " Psy- 
chologic Foundations of Education " at once puts an 
end to this state of things, and meets the desire, 
often expressed and still oftener felt by the fore- 
most teachers, educators, and thinkers of the coun- 
try, that Dr. Harris should embody his system in a 
single treatise. It would be only belittling the work

to apply to it the stock expression, that its appear- 
ance is the " event of the year." 

The space at our disposal forbids the more 
lengthy notice that the book deserves and that we 
should be glad to give. There are plenty of points 
that attract the reviewer's attention. The scheme 
adopted, going over the principal matters consid- 
ered twice once unsystematically in the chapters 
bearing the general title " Psychologic Method," 
and then systematically in another series entitled 
" Psychologic System " has its points of both ad- 
vantage and disadvantage. The book is not one for 
novices and amateurs ; even trained pedagogists will 
not always find it easy reading. Dr. Harris is so 
completely at home in the pale land of philosophical 
abstractions, that he does not always make sufficient 
allowance for the infirmity of the ordinary reader ; 
we mean the ordinary reader of solid pedagogical 
works. We are well aware that such a mind as his 
cannot pour out all its riches in a duodecimo vol- 
ume of four hundred pages, but there are some 
points that we think he should have treated more 
fully. Such a page as the following one, however, 
leaves nothing to be desired on the score of clearness. 

" We have omitted any notice of the fields of labour 
now diligently worked in the psycho-physiological labora- 
tories of America and Europe namely, the ascertain- 
ment of exact quantitative experiments of the velocity 
and intensity of nerve-currents to the brain from vari- 
ous organs, or outwardly from the. former to the latter. 
All quantitative measurement is useful in the process of 
inventorying Nature, and there is no doubt that the 
devotees of ' psycho-physics ' will discover much that is 
valuable on their road. De Soto and others went in 
search of the ' Fountain of Youth ' and discovered vast 
rivers and the details of the continent, though the ob- 
ject of their expeditions was a figment of the imagina- 
tion. Saul, the son of Kish, went out to find his father's 
asses, but found a kingdom.' Many people have done 
the reverse of this, and meu of average capacity are 
usually well satisfied if in their search for kingdoms they 
are rewarded by finding useful beasts of burden. In the 
laboratories of the students of psychology no metaphys- 
ical results, nor results in pure psychology of a positive 
character, will be arrived at, it is safe enough to say. 
But it is equally safe to expect very useful discoveries 
relating to the proper care and nurture of our nervous 
system in short, a stock of pathological and educa- 
tional knowledge and scientific insight into the relation 
of man to other animals, and to his own historic evo- 
lution." 

Perhaps no writer has subjected the educational 
system of Rousseau to a more searching examination 
than has Mr. Davidson in his work on " Rousseau 
and Education According to Nature." Beginning 
with the ideas and aspirations current in Rousseau's 
time, and that filled his atmosphere, the author pro- 
ceeds to relate the material facts of Rousseau's life, 
to expound his educational theories, and sum up his 
influence, in a volume that, for its size, leaves noth- 
ing to be desired in respect to fulness, clearness, or 
general correctness. As he suggests in his preface, 
the " Rousseau" stands at the opposite pole of thought 
to his " Aristotle "; that work gave an account of 



262

[Oct. 16, 



ancient, classical, and social education, while the 
present one deals with modern, romantic, and un- 
social education. The chapter on Rousseau's influ- 
ence gives a brief but comprehensive and firm view 
of the extent and nature of the effects that he pro- 
duced on politics, religion, literature, art, and edu- 
cation. Under the last head, Mr. Davidson finds 
that most of the good work which he did was merely 
negative. He says : 

" In so far as Rousseau laid bare the defects and abuses 
of the society and education of his time, and demanded 
reforms in the direction of truth and simplicity, he did 
excellent work; but when be came to tell how such re- 
forms were to be accomplished, be propounded a system 
which, from a social and moral point of view, has hardly 
one redeeming feature, and which is frequently in glar- 
ing contradiction with itself." 

Still, he says Rousseau's influence has been power- 
ful beyond measure, and calls him the father of 
modern pedagogy, even despite the fact that most 
of his positive teachings had to be rejected. He 
calls him, too, the father of democracy, which sug- 
gests to us the principal criticism that we have to 
make on the book. We do not find in it an ade- 
quate recognition of the prodigious influence that 
modern democracy has had on modern education. 
The author's final estimate of his subject appears to 
be a late one ; at least, he says in his preface : " If my 
estimate of Rousseau's value as an educator proves 
disappointing to those who believe in his doctrines, 
I can only say, in excuse, that I am more disap- 
pointed than they are." 

It is not always, or perhaps often, that a definite 
centre of unity and interest can be discovered in a 
book which is made up of the author's miscellaneous 
addresses and essays covering a period of fifteen 
years, even when they relate to the same general 
subject. This may, however, be fairly claimed for 
Dr. Butler's new volume, " The Meaning of Educa- 
tion," the reason being that his thinking on educa- 
tion is controlled by a consistent general view of 
the whole field ; a view formed, he expressly tells 
us, from the evolutionary standpoint His utter- 
ances on educational subjects, he also assures us, 
have been controlled by the following convictions : 

" First, that education, in the broad sense in which I 
use the term, is the most important of human interests, 
since it deals with the preservation of the culture and 
efficiency that we have inherited and with their exten- 
sion and development; second, that this common interest 
can and should be studied in a scientific spirit and by a 
scientific method; and, third, that in a democracy at 
least an education is a failure that does not relate itself 
to the duties and opportunities of citizenship." 

The book is not a treatise, and does not profess to 
be ; still, questions that are raised in one address 
or essay are sometimes answered in another. Thus, 
the author's statement at the close of the second 
address, that " that knowledge is of most worth 
which stands in closest relation to the highest forms 
of the activity of that spirit which is created in the 
image of Him who holds nature and man alike in 



the hollow of His hand," leaves us inquiring what 
this knowledge is ; but by turning back to the pre- 
ceding address we find at least the practical answer. 
There is no part of the book that college and uni- 
versity men can read to more advantage than the 
third one : " Is there a New Education ? " Dr. 
Butler here declares that as respects the application 
of psychological knowledge to teaching, the ele- 
mentary teacher, especially in the Western States, 
is far in advance of all other teachers. And he sets 
forth in strong language the ignorance of the prin- 
ciples of pedagogy and of education shown by a 
large number of teachers in the higher schools. 
" Here and there a secondary school master, and 
here and there a college president or professor, takes 
a genuine and intelligent interest in education for 
its own sake ; but the vast majority know nothing 
of it and are but little affected by it." He might 
have added that, as a rule, the farther these teach- 
ers have followed their own lines of specialized 
study, the more thoroughly Germanized they have 
become, the less they know and the less they care 
about education as such. 

The Countess of Warwick thus explains, in her 
brief preface, the genesis of the book on Women's 
Education in Great Britain, for which she stands 
sponsor : 

" Amongst the multifarious sights of the Jubilee 
year of our Gracious Queen's reign, perhaps none gave 
greater occasion for thoughtful interest than the ' Wo- 
men's Work Section ' of the Victorian Era Exhibition 
at Earl's Court; and of these the sub-section Education ' 
was a striking object lesson of a movement essentially 
belonging to the past sixty years. In addition to the 
permanent exhibit in the Education Section, a series of 
Saturday Conferences and a three days' Education Con- 
gress were arranged. The Conferences dealt with vari- 
ous sides of women's work, professional and educational; 
the Congress with what might be called the Imperial 
aspect of Education." 

The volume contains the addresses, papers, and dis- 
cussions that were offered in these Saturday Con- 
ferences, together with some prefatory and introduc- 
tory matter. It is a book of facts rather than of 
ideas, an attempt to show what, in the Jubilee 
Year, the British Empire was doing for the educa- 
tion of women. Those who are seeking information 
concerning this many-sided subject will find it here. 
If we could have a volume giving a similar view of 
women's education in the year that the Gracious 
Queen ascended the throne, the two books would 
offer about as striking an educational contrast, con- 
sidering the interval of time, as could well be shown. 
Port-Poyal Education " will be a welcome addi- 
tion to pedagogical libraries in the United States. 
The group of great teachers, able teachers and writ- 
ers, and noble men and women for whom the name 
stands is not as well known among us as it should 
be. The book is mainly composed of extracts, but 
the editor has supplied an historical and critical 
introduction of sixty-seven pages. For this country 
this introduction, while a good one in itself, might

have been better ; a more detailed and elementary 
account of Port Royal and of what the name signi- 
fies, would have added interest to the book. The 
extracts are the best of the Port Royal pedagogy, 
and they show the depth, weight, and seriousness of 
all that the famous solitaires wrote and did. It is 
well to read such classics, if for no other purpose than 
to show how much that is now thought new is really 
old. Might we not now accept Nicole's definition 
of the most essential quality in the preceptor of a 
prince as a good definition of the essential quality 
in the teacher? 

" It cannot be better explained than by saying that it 
is that quality which makes a man always blame what is 
blameworthy, praise what is praiseworthy, disparage 
what is low, impress with a sense of what is great, judge 
everything wisely and equitably, and express his judg- 
ments in an agreeable manner, suitable to those to whom 
he speaks, and, in fine, makes him direct the mind of 
his pupils to the truth in everything." 

And then, how modern are these paragraphs from 
the same writer : 

" The aim of instruction is to carry our minds to the 
highest point they are capable of attaining." 

" It does not give memory, imagination, nor intelli- 
gence, but it cultivates them all. By strengthening 
them one by another, the judgment is aided by the 
memory, and the memory is assisted by the imagination 
and the judgment." 

" When some of these parts are absent they should be 
supplied by others. Thus, the tact of a master is shown 
in setting his scholars to things for which they have a 
natural liking. Some children should be instructed 
almost solely with what depends on memory, because 
their memories are strong, but their judgment weak ; and 
others should at first be set to things regarding judg- 
ment, because they have more judgment than memory." 

" It is not properly the teachers nor extraneous 
instruction that cause things to be understood; at most 
they only expose them to the interior light of the mind, 
by which alone they are accompanied; so that when this 
light is not found, instruction is as useless as wishing to 
show pictures during the night." 

No matter whether they agree or not with the 
opinion expressed not long ago that President Eliot 
is the greatest constructive force that has acted upon 
American education in recent years, the better teach- 
ers and educators of the country will heartily wel- 
come the volume of essays and addresses to which 
he has given the name of " Educational Reform." 
He explains, in his preface, that the papers con- 
tained in the volume have been selected from a much 
larger number, on the ground that they set forth 
with clearness and sufficient amplitude the various 
educational reforms that he has been trying to pro- 
mote during the last thirty years. The title well 
expresses the character of the work, as " educational 
reformer " would well express the character of its 
author. We notice the absence from the collection 
of the articles on " The New Education " published 
in " The Atlantic Monthly," which first drew gen- 
eral attention to Dr. Eliot, and had much to do, as 
was then understood, with making him President 
of Harvard University. The arrangement is chrono- 



logical, and the first paper is the inaugural address, 
delivered in October, 1869. The author says that 
almost all the reforms advocated in the later papers 
are distinctly, though slightly, outlined in this ad- 
dress ; possibly, however, some of his readers will 
not be able to see them all there as distinctly as he 
sees them. The papers are marked by that breadth 
of view, virility of thought and expression, and 
courage which have contributed so much to the suc- 
cess of President Eliot's administration at Harvard, 
and without which it would have been impossible. 
We find him saying in the inaugural : " In spite of 
the familiar picture of the moral dangers which en- 
viron the student, there is no place so safe as a good 
college during the critical passage from boyhood to 
manhood." If he can persuade the public of this 
truth, he will at once assuage the anxieties of some 
breasts that are now troubled, and stimulate attend- 
ance upon colleges. The papers are eighteen in 
number, and they touch the whole range of educa- 
tion, from lowest to highest, professional schools 
included. 

Herbart's "Application of Psychology to the 
Science of Education " is, so far as we are aware, 
the fourth of this writer's educational works to be 
presented in an English dress. Translations of 
the " Text-book in Psychology," the " Science of 
Education," and the " ^Esthetic Revelation of the 
World," the two last in one volume, came out some 
years ago. The " Application " was a late pro- 
duct of Herbart's pen ; it appeared in the form of 
short letters, was meant to be supplementary to the 
" Science of Education," and was never completed. 
Miss Millner has rendered students of pedagogy, 
and especially Herbartians, a service by her trans- 
lation and her " Introduction to the Study of Her- 
bart." The frequent translation of Herbart's books, 
to say nothing of the large secondary literature, 
shows how much interest the Herbartian pedagogy 
has awakened. This interest cannot be indefinitely 
maintained, relatively speaking, and it is not desir- 
able that it should be ; but it will not ebb until the 
more valuable Herbartian ideas have become incor- 
porated into our general stock of pedagogical 
thought, such as the ethical ideal, apperception, and 
interest. We do not remember a better brief char- 
acterization of Herbart than the one that Mr. David- 
son gives in the work noticed above : 

"Ideas are treated as forces which may be com- 
pounded, and whose mechanical relations and resultants 
may be stated in mathematical formulas. With such 
notions he could, of course, arrive at no conception of a 
free will or any true morality. To have will Is nothing 
more than the mechanical resultant of his idea-forces. 
But in spite of these serious drawbacks, which tend to 
make education a mere mechanical matter, Herbart's 
contributions to the science of pedagogy were most val- 
uable and lasting." 

President Taylor's " Study of the Child " is some- 
thing quite different from the conventional book on 
child-study. It is not an inventory of child-actions, 
child-words, and child-ideas and feelings, nicely ex-

pressed in tobies and summaries and left with little 
attempt at interpretation or synthesis a monument 
to their author's interest in facto, but it is just 
what the secondary title expresses, a brief treatise on 
the psychology of the child. It is strongly marked 
by the method and spirit of the objective psychology, 
and could not have been written without the new 
insight from that quarter, but it also recognizes the 
fact that, at bottom, psychology is an introspective 
science. The matter of the book is well chosen, the 
plan easy and natural, and the style clear, while the 
more abstract parts are well set off by concrete 
examples. 

Professor and Mrs. Bryan's " Republic of Plato " 
has been prepared with a view of bringing the ideas, 
methods, and spirit of that great master to bear 
more directly upon the teaching and education of 
the country. The object is a commendable one. 
The " Studies for Teachers " consist of careful 
analyses of the several books of the " Republic " 
what it was once the fashion to call " arguments." 
These studies those who use the book will find very 
helpful. Following them is a general introduction, 
historical and critical in character. The editors 
have taken a hint from the current Sunday School 
Lesson Leaf : " In the Studies some golden sayings 
have been quoted in full, in the hope of making them 
current coin among us." 

Dr. Oppenheim's " Development of the Child " is 
made up of a series of well-considered studies, writ- 
ten solely from the modern objective or strictly sci- 
entific point of view. We interpret the book to 
mean that the author took up for discussion a class 
of subjects that he thought very important and also 
very much neglected, and not that it expresses 
the full range of his pedagogical thought. His 
method and spirit are well shown by the chapter 
devoted to the value of the child as a witness in 
suits at law. After showing that the old writers on 
evidence placed the stress on the religious element 
involved in the sanctity of an oath, he proceeds to 
show that it should rather be placed on the child's 
ability to understand the facts involved in his testi- 
mony and correctly to report them. His argument 
is perfectly conclusive, but we fear that a majority 
of jurists and lawyers have not the scientific train- 
ing to appreciate its force. The subject has obvious 
practical difficulties, and we are by no means sure 
that the dictum, " The only safeguard that can 
effectually preserve the common interest is the with- 
drawal of such child-evidence from courts of law as 
a well-informed man must, a priori, doubt," would 
remove them. Dr. Oppenheim finds in the profes- 
sion of maternity the highest activity of woman, but 
he does not find that the new education provided 
for women in any way fits them the better for the 
performance of this activity. But this opinion is 
less discouraging than the old one, which was that 
it tended directly to unfit them. He holds that a 
careful and exact preparation for the work in hand 
has to a certain extent received recognition, that it 



is one step of immense importance, one stride in the 
right direction ; still, he contends that the young 
man enters much more fully into the enjoyment of 
the new education than the young woman, even if 
her education is described as higher." " A young 
man's training," he tells us, is designed to further 
his ability to accomplish definite work in the world ; 
his sister's is still arranged on the plan of making 
her appear better cared for, more advantageously 
placed, better apparelled in mental garments than 
her neighbors." It is quite safe to say that a ma- 
jority of the young women now in colleges and uni- 
versities will not take kindly to this view of the 
matter. 

In her attractive volume, " Child Culture in the 
Home," Mrs. Mosher addresses to mothers, in a 
pleasant style, much sound instruction that they need 
to know and lay to heart. There are sixteen chap- 
ters, all bearing such practical titles as " The Emo- 
tions," " The Moral Sense," " The Training of the 
Will," " Manners," " Domestic Economy," and 
" Civic Duties." We have not discovered fresh or 
novel ideas in the book, but its old lessons, shaped 
anew and fitted to new conditions, will never go out 
of fashion, because they are essential to sound child- 
culture, and, in great degree, to the best interests of 
human life. 

The motif in the preparation of " A Study of a 
Child," as stated by the author, " is the interest 
awakened in America and Europe by the child-study 
movement, the fascination that lies in the sayings 
and the doings of children, and especially the ex- 
pressed desire of psychologists, physicians, and 
teachers for opportunity to study individual child 
records, both normal and abnormal." The book 
opens with an argumentative chapter, " Reasons for 
Child-Study in the Home," and then proceeds with 
the " record " which " is given exactly as it was 
originally written, with a few additional explanatory 
remarks concerning the course taken to produce the 
results recorded." These " results " are a large 
collection of facts observed by an intelligent observer 
in the first eight years of the development of an 
individual child, that is endorsed as healthy, happy, 
and intelligent, care being taken to interfere as little 
as possible with his spontaneity. They have slight 
connection, or rather none except what is furnished 
by chronological sequence. The large number of 
original drawings add to the value of the book. 

The foregoing list of books suggest two or three 
things that are worth noting. One is the activity 
of the pedagogical mind of the country. These 
works all bear the date 1898, and are the accumu- 
lation of three or four months. It is not so very 
long ago that, to make up an equal list, one would 
have been compelled to run over a series of years, 
and then the books would have been only relatively 
as good. It is only within a few years that books 
of as high a character as several of these began to 
be written in the country. Again, the list shows, 
very happily, the range that our pedagogical litera-

tare is taking. The three great fields are all covered 
more or less fully the science, the art, and the 
history of education. Unless all signs fail, the ed- 
ucation of the country must be steadily improving.

text-book. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Professor Shorey's edition of the 
Odes and Epodes of Horace, recently 
published in " The Students' Series 
of Latin Classics " ( Benj. H. Sanborn & Co.), is a 
text-book of such unusual value that it must be given 
more than the perfunctory mention usually accorded 
to publications of this description. There are an- 
notated editions of Horace without number for col- 
lege use, and it would seem at first thought that to 
add another to the number was about as unnecessary 
a task as a scholar could attempt. But an examina- 
tion of this new edition not only justifies its exist- 
ence, but sets a new standard of excellence for works 
of the class to which it belongs. To put the matter 
briefly, we doubt if there has ever before been 
brought to the preparation of a classical text for 
school use so complete a knowledge of the literature 
of all ages and so great a wealth of illustrative ma- 
terial as are condensed into the four hundred pages 
of Dr. Shorey's introduction and notes. There is 
such a thing, no doubt, as over-annotation, but this 
criticism does not apply to the apparatus with which 
the present volume is provided, and an examination 
of these notes, extensive as they are, reveals the 
fact that, so far from being padded, or eked out by 
the admission of pedantic trivialities, they illustrate 
the extreme of compactness, and that they contain 
nothing the scholar would willingly miss. The 
average college student, of course, could get along 
with much less help than is here offered, but for 
him the remedy is obvious enough, and the book 
has the great merit of providing the student (in or 
out of college) who is not of the average type with 
a richer treasury of comment, parallel passages, and 
Horatian echoes in modern poetry, than has pre- 
viously been brought within the covers of one vol- 
ume. Let us quote one note, taken almost at ran- 
dom, by way of illustration. The subject is from 
Ode IV., XIV., 31. 

" Metendo : c/. on 4, 11, 30. For image, cf. II., 11, 67, 19, 
223; Catull., 64, 353-355; Verg., Ma., 10, 513; JEschyl., 
Suppl., 637 ; Gray, The Bard, ' And thro' the kindred squad- 
rons mow their way'; Macaulay, Regillus, 23, 'Like corn 
before the sickle | The stout Lavinians fell'; Swinburne, 
Erechtheus, ' Sickles of man-slaughtering edge | Ground for 
no hopeful harvest of ripe grain '; Shaks., Tro. and Cress., 5, 5, 
' And there the strawy Greeks ripe for his edge | Fall down 
before him like the mower's swath.' " 

When one has hundreds of pages of this sort of 
thing, it becomes impressive. We may add that 
the quotations given in the notes are taken not only 
from Greek, Latin, and English literature, but also, 
although somewhat more sparingly, from the clas- 
sical writers of France, Germany, and Italy. Yet, 



in the face of all that has been given, the editor 
remarks, truthfully enough: "It would not have 
been difficult to add indefinitely to the quotations 
from English poetry, and the task of selection was 

not easy." 

Mr. Remington Home-keeping folks of steady habits 
as artist may find Mr. Frederic Remington's 

bouquet of wild-life sketches, entitled 
" Crooked Trails " (Harper), rather dangerous read- 
ing. Mr. Remington's enthusiasm for the scenes he 
paints is infectious enough to tempt a sedentary 
man into exchanging the trusty arm-chair for the 
plunging bronco or the fickle canoe as did the 
misguided attorney who figures as a sort of Tartarin 
in one of the present sketches. With the work of 
Mr. Remington the artist we are all more or less 
familiar. He is the delineator par excellence of 
the Indian, the cavalryman, the cowboy, and the 
" greaser," and the sharp realism of his pictures will 
make them of positive historical value to future 
generations, when the types and phases of Amer- 
ican character he chooses to portray have disap- 
peared from the shifting stage of our national life. 
With Mr. Remington the author we are not so 
familiar ; but the present volume shows that Mr. 
Remington can write if not nearly so well as he 
can draw still fairly well. His book is not free 
from expressions of (to put it mildly ) questionable 
taste, such as " Nature had slobbered all over Car- 
ter Johnson," and the like. These outbreaks are 
clearly efforts on Mr. Remington's part to seem 
" breezy " and off-hand ; but they are clumsy and evi- 
dently forced. How well he can write when he is con- 
tent to be himself, the following pretty bit of word- 
painting shows : " The colors play upon the senses 
the reddish-yellow of the birch-barks, the blue of 
the water, and the silver sheen as it parts at the 
bows of the canoes ; the dark evergreens, the steely 
rocks with their lichens, the white trunks of the 
birches, their fluffy tops so greeny green, and over 
all the gold of a summer day." All in all, Mr. 
Remington's book is a delightful one. Of course 
the pictures are the best part of it. There are forty- 
nine of them in all, and they are to the text what 
the gem is to the setting. The volume is a comely 
one, and it will make a tempting gift-book when the 
Holiday season comes again. 

Miss Harriett Wright Smith's " His- 
tory of the Lowell Institute " (Lam- 
son, Wolffe, & Co.) describes an edu- 
cational endowment, simply planned and effectively 
administered, which stands almost without a parallel. 
John Lowell, third of the name, was the son of 
Francis Cabot Lowell, who introduced cotton spin- 
ning into New England and for whom the city of 
Lowell was named, and was cousin to James Rus- 
sell Lowell, the poet-professor. Dying in Bombay 
in 1836, while yet a young man, he left $250,000, 
the half of his fortune, to the care of a single trustee 
who should have power to name his successor, always 
to be a member of the Lowell family, if one worthy

of the trust could be found. The income of the 
fund thus provided, except one-tenth which should 
be regularly added to the principal, should be ex- 
pended in providing free public lectures to be given 
in the city of Boston by distinguished scholars of 
the highest attainments. The first lecture was de- 
livered on December 31, 1839, by Edward Everett. 
Since then, more than fifty-four hundred lectures 
have been given by three hundred and fifty-two 
lecturers. The list of subjects includes the most 
important topics known to human philosophy, dis- 
cussed by the moat advanced thinkers of the age, of 
whom Agassiz, Guyot, Tyndall, Drummond, Rogers, 
Eliot, and Walker are worthy examples. The bene- 
ficial results of this endowment in the development 
of the culture of Boston cannot be estimated. Many 
epoch-marking books have been first presented to 
the public as Lowell Lectures. While the honora- 
riums paid to the lecturers have been generously 
adequate to the service, the finances have been so 
skilfully administered that the original endowment 
has been about doubled.

A well-balanced history of Martin 
Luther is certainly one of the most 
an<i MOM. difficult things in the world to write. 

Himself a man of intense personality, a sort of 
theological Bismarck, his memory rejoices itself 
with devoted friends and laughs at impotent ene- 
mies ; the calm dispassion which should characterize 
the biographer being a world's length from both. 
Dr. Henry Eyster Jacobs, author of the life of 
Luther, which makes the first volume of a series to 
be known as " Heroes of the Reformation " (Put- 
nam), is Dean of the Evangelical Lutheran Semi- 
nary in Philadelphia and Professor of Systematic 
Theology therein matters which array him among 
the great innovator's followers and admirers. Tet 
it is surely more humane to let the friends rather 
than the adversaries of any given person set forth 
his qualities, appreciatively and not without rev- 
erence, as in the case before us. Dr. Jacobs has 
been careful to keep on solid ground. The myths 
which have done much to obscure the real entity 
behind them are cleared away, and the triumphs 
and trials of a very human personality disclosed. 
Some of the more important documents on the 
other side are given in full, a welcome concession 
to impartiality. Nor is the book too voluminous, 
while its interest is heightened by many illustrations. 
What it has done for its famous subject may be 
summarized thus: Leaving him still the hero, it 
affords us a portrait of the man. 

Complaint has been rightly made by 
those best entitled to be heard in the 
premises, that modern fiction in gen- 
eral deals with the art of music as if it were some- 
thing to be learned without painstaking not an 
art with a science and history and literature of its 
own, but something of which it can be affirmed, 
" This is good that is bad," empirically, by rule 



of thumb, and without reference to any ascertain- 
able canon of taste. Complaint has also been made 
by many and many a critic recently, that a book 
showing some real knowledge of the technique and 
history of the musical art, " Evelyn Innes " for ex- 
ample, is quite beyond the reach of readers (mean- 
ing the critics), and should be reconstructed on more 
popular grounds. Now comes Miss Hannah Smith 
to the rescue with "Music, How it Came to Be 
What It Is" (Scribner), which is a simple, attrac- 
tive, and wholly comprehensible presentation of 
precisely what it is that every person of culture 
should know regarding the fundamental facts of 
music, serving also to point out to them the Cim- 
merian darkness of their ignorance in a startling 
number of cases. Almost everyone sets himself up 
as a literary or dramatic critic with at least some 
notion of the laws of construction in literature and 
the drama ; this book will prove that critic upon 
critic of music assumes for himself a knowledge of 
musical construction by mere instinct. Miss Smith's 
work is commendable in every respect save one : 
she should have gone to anthropology instead of 
literary tradition for her account of the beginnings 
of the art she does so much to make comprehensible 
in its later developments. 

siudietof Professor Wesley Mills, of McGill 

animal University, has collected, in a volume 

entitled ' The Nature and Develop- 
ment of Animal Intelligence " (Macmillan), sundry 
memoirs, addresses, and discussions on animal psy- 
chology. After some general remarks he treats of 
feigning among squirrels, of hibernation among 
various animals, of psychic development of young 
animals, and closes with a discussion on instinct. 
The most valuable part of the book is the diaries 
showing the growth, physical and psychical, of dogs, 
cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, pigeons, and chickens. 
While this work cannot be accounted a thorough- 
going connected monograph, it contains much good 
and suggestive observation, and opens up a fascin- 
ating field of study. The candid, cautious, thought- 
ful spirit of the author is to be greatly commended 
in this age of rash generalization. Like all who 
seriously study animals, Professor Mills finds in 
them an unsuspected mental complexity, a force and 
amount of psychic life, which is far beyond what the 
public grant them. He confirms the common belief 
that the woodchuck is a predictor of storms. 

The effect of food, both in its nature 
and quantity, upon the determination 
of the sex of developing organisms 
has often been the subject of experiment by the 
biologist, though not always with accordant results. 
Dr. Schenk, director of the Embryological Institute 
of the University of Vienna, has propounded a 
theory which has been much exploited of late in the 
daily press ; this has now been given to the expec- 
tant public in an " authorized translation " (Schenk's 
Theory, the Determination of Sex; Werner). Fol-

lowing the suggestions of previous theories and ex- 
periments, the author finds a partial solution of the 
problem in a regulated diet. The experimental 
and statistical data given in support of his views, 
though interesting and perhaps suggestive to the 
physiologist, do not advance the theory beyond the 
experimental stage, nor are they adequate to com- 
mand its wide acceptance in scientific circles, and 
are quite insufficient, in the present state of the 
question, to justify a popular faith in its efficacy. 
The greater part of the book is made up of an un- 
organized repetition and confused jumble of the 
various crude and conflicting theories advanced 
upon this subject since the days of Aristotle. There 
is neither a table of contents nor an index to guide 
the reader through this maze of rubbish. The trans- 
lation is none too well done, and, as in the case of 
the original, no semblance of a bibliography of the 
subject appears. 

The " Early Letters of George Will- 

iam Curtis to John S ' & wight" 
( Harper ), edited by Mr. George 
Willis Cooke, have all the elusive charm one of 
many which attaches to an overheard telephonic 
conversation. The references to what the other 
fellow says are not eliminated, and a delightful 
opportunity to guess what the missing links might 
be ensues, most gratifying to Yankee inquisitiveness. 
Curtis was a boy in the Brook Farm School, sent 
there because it was probably the best secondary 
school in the country at that time. Curtis and the 
Farm being what they were, the resulting tale is 
not only a literary treat which, considering the 
lapse of years, it very well might not have been 
but a charming picture, replete with good humor, 
of departed ambrosial days. This latter aspect the 
editor has judiciously preserved by rescuing to 
be chromatic a daguerreotype or two of the time, 
as when he quotes from Mrs. Kirby to show us the 
youthful Curtis " as Fanny Ellsler, in a low-necked, 
short-sleeved, book-muslin dress, and a tiny ruffled 
apron, making courtesies and pirouetting down the 
path." There are, besides, a number of later letters 
" from the same to the same," which round out the 
value and worth of a very pleasant little book to 
read and to own.

" Book-Trade Bibliography in the United States in 
the XlXth Century." It contains full accounts of 
early booksellers' associations, of the conditions sur- 
rounding the book-trade in its beginnings in Amer- 
ica, of the first " helps " which became catalogues 
and journals in later years, of the succeeding bib- 
liographies which makes the book something very 
near that long sought for thing, a bibliography of 
bibliographies ; and, in addition, it holds excellent 
biographies of the men who attained fame in the 



bibliographic field, taking in the interesting careers 
of men as widely known as Charles B. Norton, 
Henry Stevens, Nicolas Trubner, Joseph Sabin, and 
Frederick Leypoldt. Then, by way of climax to 
this list of treasures, there is appended the full text 
of the ' Catalogue of all the Books Printed in the 
United States. . . . Published by the Booksellers 
in Boston, January, 1804." The whole has been 
prepared by Mr. A. Grow-all, the managing editor 
of the " Publishers' Weekly," and is in excellent 
taste throughout, both in matter and manner. All 
this information has its value heightened, charac- 
teristically, by the announcement that a hundred 
copies and no more are printed for the non-members 
of the Dibdin Club in America. Possibly the weight- 
iest thing in a book which contains nothing unim- 
portant is the story of the life of the late Henry 
Stevens. This really eminent American was forced, 
against his will and strong desire, to purvey to the 
libraries of Europe, that of the British Museum in 
particular, numbers of works pertaining to America 
which are not to be found in this country at all. 
The persons responsible for this apathy, which has 
placed the finest existing collection of Americana 
in London rather than Washington, are, of course, 
the members of past American Congresses. 

A curious discrepancy between aim 
Homer'* women and execut i on keeps The Women 

misplaced, *j 

of Homer (Dodd), prepared by 
Mr. Walter Copland Perry, from being a work of 
real delight. His subject and the age are alike 
auspiciously chosen something like Mr. George 
P. Upton's " Woman in Music " should result : old 
facts made new by artistic juxtaposition and an illu- 
minating intelligence. The intention is, of course, 
to wrest Homer's women from one literary setting 
and place them in another ; the fact stands before 
us in a scrappy, almost hasty, book, without an index, 
inconsecutive and illogical. Search may be made 
in vain for the first of the Homeric women, that 
dainty, fleeting impression of the pretty maiden re- 
turned to her old father's arms, 

" Many another bard some maiden sings 
Dearer to me Chry seis on the sands 



and the insistent dwelling upon the goddesses rather 
than the flesh-and-blood personages of the two epics 
is, after all, disappointing. So the work stands : 
too replete with Greek quotations and specialized 
Homeric knowledge for enjoyment by the many, 
too insistently written down to the many in other 
respects to make an appeal to the few.

various excellences, personal and otherwise, and 
"The Eugene Field I Knew " (Scribner) is a very 
attractive person indeed. What the little book con- 
tains, however, is rather the raw material of the 
biographer than the finished product. We are some- 
what at a loss to understand the reasons for includ- 
ing the facetious epitaph in the closing pages of the 
book. As a rale, Field's friends have been careful 
to keep all the work he did of this sort from the 
ears of the public, though not a few competent 
judges have held that it is here that his fame 
such as it may turn out to be is most secure. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The Roycroft Press, situate in the little town of 
East Aurora, N. Y., is turning out from time to time 
some choicely-printed volumes which lovers of artistic 
bookmaking should not overlook. Their latest product 
is a comely volume, bound in gray boards with back of 
rough green leather, entitled " Hand and Brain." It is 
made up of six essays on socialism, written by William 
Morris, Grant Allen, George Bernard Shaw, Henry S. 
Salt, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Edward Carpenter. 
The names of these writers alone are a sufficient indica- 
tion of the literary quality of the essays, and they are 
given a mechanical setting which is fully up to the pre- 
vious high standards of the Royorofters. 

The sixth volume in the new biographical edition of 
Thackeray (Harper) contain the " Contributions to 
Punch,'" which include "The Book of Snobs," the 
" Novels by Eminent Hands," the " History of the Next 
French Revolution," and many other matters. The 
connection with " Punch " lasted for about ten years, 
and was discontinued because Thackeray could not 
agree with the position taken by the paper toward Prince 
Albert, Lord Palmerston, and Louis Napoleon. It is 
interesting to read that it was Thackeray's intention to 
include the " Novels by Eminent Hands " with parodies 
of Dickens and himself, but that the publishers were 
not willing to have Dickens thus caricatured. Mrs. 
Ritchie says: " We read the ' Prize Novelists ' for real 
stories, and longed for them to be finished, instead of 
always breaking off at the most interesting point" 

Preceded by a careful essay upon the various versions 
of the Rev. S. R. Driver's psalms of David which have 
appeared in English from the time of Wycliffe, " Par- 
allel Psalter " (Oxford Press) is a conscientious attempt 
to bring new readings to the better comprehension of 
these ancient songs. The work does not seem to be one 
tbat is destined for popularity, though this is unques- 
tionably its intention. The Prayer-Book version of the 
Psalter stands on one page, with Dr. Driver's version 
over against it, this latter showing every proof of a 
ripe and thoughtful scholarship, which has refused to 
sacrifice accuracy to literary attractiveness. 

The " European History Studies," edited by Dr. F. M. 
Fling, which have been coming periodically to our table 
during the past year, are now sent out in a small vol- 
ume by Mr. J. H. Miller, Lincoln, Nebraska. The 
studies are ten in number, deal with Greek and Roman 
history, and are to be warmly commended to teachers 
who understand the value of getting at tbe sources, even 
for the purposes of elementary work. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

The Macmillan Co. have added " Doctor Pascal," in 
Mrs. Serrano's translation, to their growing edition of 
M. Zola's novels. 

An edition of the " Alcestis " of Euripides, prepared 
by Dr. Herman W. Hayley, has just been published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish a pretty school 
edition of " The Vicar of Wakefield," edited by Pro- 
fessor William Henry Hudson. 

The forthcoming life of the Rev. Dr. Newman Hall 
of London will be published in an American edition by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

The Century Co. have just published a new edition of 
Dr. Weir Mitchell's " Far in tbe Forest," an admirable 
story first issued nearly ten years ago. 

" The Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation of St. John," 
edited by Professor R. G. Monlton for the Modern 
Reader's Bible," is published by tbe Macmillan Co. 

The next publication of the " Brothers of the Book," 
of Gouverneur, N. Y., will be a volume of verse by 
Mr. Claude Fayette Bragdon entitled "The Golden 
Person in the Heart." 

Dr. Ferdinand Schwill, of the University of Chicago, 
has written a text-book of the " History of Modern 
Europe," which work has just been published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" Wireless Telegraphy Popularly Explained," by Mr. 
Richard Kerr, is a very small volume just imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, and provided with a 
preface by Mr. W. H. Preece. 

Selections from Macaulay, Carlyle, and Mr. Rnskin 
make up the respective contents of three small books in 
the series of " Little Masterpieces," now published by 
the Doubleday & McClure Co. 

Two important books of travel to be issued shortly by 
Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. are " A Cruise under the 
Crescent " by Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard, and "Along 
the Bospborns " by Mrs. Lew Wallace. 

Tbe G. W. Dillingham Co. have just put forth a 
revised edition of " The Complete Works of Artemus 
Ward," in a single handsome volume, with a portrait, 
numerous illustrations, and an introductory sketch. 

" The Classics for the Million," being " an epitome in 
English of the works of the principal Greek and Latin 
authors," by Mr. Henry Grey, is a book that describes 
itself. It is an English production, and Messrs. Put- 
nam's Sons publish it in this country. 

" The Individual in Relation to Law and Institutions," 
being Part I. of a monograph on " The Individual and 
his Relation to Society as Reflected in British Ethics," 
by Professor J. H. Tufts and Miss Helen B. Thompson, 
has just been issued in pamphlet form by tbe University 
of Chicago Press. 

"Great Words from Great Americans," edited by 
Mr. Paul Leicester Ford, is a pretty volume containing 
tbe fundamental documents of our constitutional history, 
besides the most famous addresses of Washington and 
Lincoln. It is a well-illustrated volume published by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

The most remarkable of recent literary finds is one 
which we first saw mentioned a few days ago, although 
it is stated that the discovery itself was made in June. 
It is nothing less than a copy of the " Original Poetry 
by Victor and Cazire," of which every student of

Shelley has dreamed that he might be the possible dis- 
coverer, but which few have supposed would be brought 
to light in the waking world. The book is dated Hors- 
ham, 1810, contains sixty pages, and will be reprinted 
at once by Mr. John Lane. It has no absolute value as 
poetry, of course, but is historically of the same interest 
and importance as the equally famous " Poems by Two 
Brothers." 

A valuable little book for those intending to take the 
Civil Service or other competitive examinations is " The 
Automatic Instructor," published by the St. Paul Book 
& Stationery Co. It is the work of a United States 
army officer, who attributes his success in a difficult 
competitive examination to the use of the system out- 
lined in his book. 

We are glad to note that " The Artist " of London 
has begun the publication of an American edition with 
a special supplement devoted to American art affairs. 
" The Artist" is one of the best of the English art journals, 
and this new departure should prove a success. Messrs. 
Truslove & Comba of New York are the publishers of 
the American edition. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a revised edition of Pro- 
fessor James M. Taylor's " Elements of the Differential 
and Integral Calculus with Examples and Applications." 
The same firm has just issued a revised edition of Dr. 
A. P. Gage's "Elements of Physics," one of the best 
text-books of the subject that have ever been prepared 
for secondary schools. 

In an artistic booklet of twenty-five pages, the trus- 
tees of the Kelmscott Press have published, through 
Messrs. Longmans & Co., " An Address delivered by 
William Morris at the distribution of prizes to students 
of the Birmingham Municipal School of Art, on Feb- 
ruary 21, 1894." The lecture is printed in the Golden " 
type and will be followed by others in the same form. 

A "school edition" of the "Latin Grammar" of 
Professors Gildersleeve and Lodge has just been issued 
by the University Publishing Co. It has about three- 
fifths the volume of the work of 1894, a condensation 
made possible by omitting a certain amount of historical 
detail and grammatical exposition intended for advanced 
students, but without any sacrifice of scientific exactness. 

A beautiful edition of Mrs. Browning's " Sonnets from 
the Portuguese " is published by Messrs. George Bell & 
Sons of London, and imported by the Macmillan Co. 
In typography and decoration the volume is very similar 
to the edition recently issued by Messrs. Copeland & 
Day in their " English Love-Sonnet " series. Messrs. 
Bell's edition, however, is much smaller in form and 
sold at a cheaper price. 

An excellent summary, the more interesting as ema- 
nating from a Catholic source, is the " Jerome Savona- 
rola, a Sketch," prepared by the Rev. J. L. O'Neil, O.P., 
of New York. The writer is an enthusiastic supporter 
of the great preacher's orthodoxy, and makes out a 
very strong case against those who see in him a rebel 
against the authority of the Holy See. Fra Bartolom- 
meo's portrait is used by way of frontispiece, and the 
work, which has received the approval of Father 
O'Neil's ecclesiastical superiors, is given an excellent 
presentation by Marlier, Callauan & Co. 

The death of Mrs. Blanche Willis Howard von Teuffel 
is reported as having taken place in Munich on the 
seventh of this month. She was born in 1847, in Maine. 
Her first success was obtained with the bright novel, 
" One Summer," which was followed by " Aulnay 



Tower," " Guenn," Aunt Serena," " The Open Door," 
and several other volumes of fiction. For the last twenty 
years or more she has lived in Germany, where she was 
married to Dr. von Teuffel in 1890. His subsequent 
insanity brought a tragedy into her life, and she wrote 
little during the last few years of her life. Her novels 
have an unfailing charm, and some of the elements of 
enduring value.

RARE ENGLISH BOOKS 

MESSRS. A. C. McCLURG & CO. announce that their repre- 
sentative has just returned from Europe, where he has been 
purchasing Fine English Books. The books secured form an unex- 
celled collection, embracing many of the choicest that could be 
obtained in the great book markets of England. A large number 
have been expressly re-bound to our order by Zaehnsdorf, Riviere, 
and other celebrated binders. 

These books are now arriving, and boxes of them will be opened 
almost daily during the next few weeks. Those desiring the earliest 
selection are advised and invited to call before the best are gone.

THE OMAHA EXPOSITION. 

When the World's Fair at Chicago ceased to exist, it 
was supposed we should ne'er look upon its like again. 
However, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha 
has effectively reproduced in similarity all of the build- 
ings which made the White City so attractive in 1893. 

It does not now take weeks to wander through grounds 
and structures and then be compelled to go away with 
a jumble of ideas, for the Omaha Exposition people have 
profited by past experience, and have so improved the 
arrangement of exhibits that no more than two or three 
days of time need be consumed in admiration and inspec- 
tion of the marvellous resources of the West, collected 
together in the chief city of Nebraska. 

Even the new Midway is a reproduction of the far- 
famed Street of All Nations of 1893, with many improve- 
ments upon the original. 

The electric lighting of the buildings, grounds, and 
lagoon at night makes a scene of enchanting beauty, alone 
worth traveling a thousand miles to see. The means of 
communication between the city and the grounds are 
ample, and the distance to be traversed is short. 

The ways of reaching Omaha are innumerable, but 
chief among them is the direct Chicago and Omaha 
short line of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Rail- 
way, with its electric-lighted, vestibuled trains, leaving 
Chicago every night at 6 :15 p. m., and arriving at Omaha 
at 8 :20 the next morning. Dining car service en route. 

Excursion tickets are on sale at every coupon ticket 
office in the United States over the Chicago, Milwaukee 
& St. Paul Railway through Northern Illinois and Cen- 
tral Iowa, as well as at 95 Adams St., and at the Union 
Passenger Station, Canal and Adams Sts., Chicago.

Third : Because of the excellent Introductions and critical comment of the editors.

According to the author, " Li 
Hung Chang's fate hangs on the 
protection of her whom he served 
so long and faithfully. She is 
aging and exposed to accidents. 
Naturally an old campaigner like 
Li looks out for a second line of 
defence, and that is Russia. Is it 
not obvious, then, that we have 
here a shorter road to the key 
of recent important transactions 
than by attempting to balance 
ordinary reasons of state? " Such 
is the opinion of a man who has 
spent much time in China. His 
book is most valuable at this time.

By STANLEY WATERLOO, author of " Story of Ab," etc. A prophetic romance of war,

Here Is a novel presenting all the element* necessary to give it popular and enduring favor. Not content with being " up-to-date," Mr. 
Waterloo has now taken his place among the prophets. In bold and striking outlines coming events are graphically set forth, from the Anglo- 
American alliance, the rushing through of the Nicaraguan Canal, and the combining of Latin nations to resist the threatened Anglo-American 
supremacy, to the final great battle of Armageddon materials great enough for an epic by Homer, but effectively handled in worthy prose.

My Scrap Book of the French 
Revolution 

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. With numerous 
and carefully selected portraits of the principal personages 
of the time. 8vo, 442 pages, $2.50. 

Out of intimate and almost personal knowledge of the subject, the 
popular author of the Nineteenth Century Histories has written a 
graphic and thrilling account of some of the most exciting and interest- 
ing phases of the French Revolution. Much of the material is trans- 
lated direct from the original French sources, many of which are difficult 
of access to the ordinary student. The narratives of eye-witnesses and 
those of actors and sufferers in the great drama are frequently quoted 
in detail.

Personal Sketches of Recent 
Authors 

By HATTIE TYNG GRISWOLD. With a handsome and 
carefully selected portrait of each author. 12mo, 352 
pages, $1.50. 

The sketches are not long and wearisome, but are so sympathetic and 
appreciative that they impress the reader with a sense of thoroughness 
which long biographies often fail to give. The materials are taken from 
the most trustworthy and authentic sources, and the facts given in the 
" sketches " may be implicitly relied on. The authors treated are : 
Tennyson, Renan, Darwin, Matthew Arnold, Du Maurier, Mrs. Brown- 
ing, Ruskin, Huxley, Mrs. Stowe, Stevenson, Howells, Louisa M. Alcott, 
Tolstoi, Kipling, Christina Rossetti, Thoreau, Bayard Taylor, Barrio.

Revised and enlarged edition, $1.50. 

After twenty years of great success and popularity a revised and 
enlarged edition of this standard book has been prepared by the author. 
Many new selections have been inserted, and a series of discussions on 
the most important topics in elocution have been added. It is the best 
book of its kind in existence. 

General Nelson's Scout 

By BYRON A. DUNN. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 

A book of the Civil War for boys, straightforward, manly and inspir- 
ing. The tangled state of affairs in Kentucky during the early days of 
the Rebellion is faithfully depicted, most of the incidents and many of 
the characters being historically true. Both Southern and Northern 
readers must be delighted with it. 

The story is told by an old soldier familiar with the scenes he describes, 
and the whole narrative is vividly real. It is handsomely illustrated. 



A Yankee Volunteer 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR. 12mo, $1.25. 

The many readers of " On the Bed Staircase " and " An Imperial 
Lover " have long been impatient for another story from Miss Taylor's 
facile pen. In this one the scene is laid not in Russia, but in Massa- 
chusetts, and the time is the beginning of the Revolution. 

The tale is the tale of a soldier and a lover ; of the things he did and 
of the things he saw and heard ; of battles and marches and imprison- 
ments ; and of how his Tory sweetheart, Mistress Joyce Talbot, at last 
relented and became a true patriot and rebel.

A Kentucky Girl. By ELEANOR TALBOT KINKEAD. 

16mo, 276 pages, $1.00. 

A charming tale of the Sunny South, and of a brave, beautiful, and 
attractive girl a story of ideals, and yet a story of the real. It is 
written in exquisite English, and with a flavor of delicate humor. The 
book will not fail to prove delightful reading, and its careful descrip- 
tions of Southern places and people, and the beauty of its narrative style, 
must render it very attractive. Miss Einkead has written other tale* 
of the South, but never so good a one as this. 

Maria Felicia 

A Story of Bohemian Love. By CAROLINE SVETLA. 
Translated from the Bohemian by ANTONIE KREJSA. 
(" Tales from Foreign Lands " Series.) 16mo, $1.00. 
This latest addition to the " Tales from Foreign Lands " sustains the 
high and unique reputation of the series. 

Freedom of thought and action, high-mindedness, and courageous 
devotion to principle are the heroine's ideals, and to follow them un- 
swervingly she resigns all her ancestral estates and wealth and joins 
the man she loves. The author, Caroline Svetla, though regarded as the 
George Eliot of Bohemia, has thus far, we believe, remained unknown 
to English readers. 
Previous volumes of the " Tales from Foreign Lands " sent* an : 

Memories ; Oraziella ; Marie ; Madeleine ; 
Marianela ; Cousin Phillis ; and Karine. 

Three Freshmen 

By JESSIE ANDERSON CHASE. 12mo, $1.00. 
An odd title for a book that is written by a girl about girls and for 
girls, yet it is appropriate. The " three freshmen " are girl students at 
Smith College : one of them comes from Chicago, one from Boston, and 
one from the South. They lead a merry, studious, and happy life, full 
of fun, frolic, and womanly kind-heartedness.

By EFFIE W. MERRIMAN. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 
In many of the States the practice of " binding out " poor children 
to farmers in the country districts still prevails. This story relates in 
most interesting fashion the adventures of a brother and sister who 
suffered this experience after their parents died. Bad treatment made 
the boy run away to the city, where he fell in with the title character, 
a sort of juvenile Mark Tapley, who is entirely new to fiction. 

The Widow O'Callaghan's Boys 

By GULIELMA ZOLLINGKR. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 
Left with seven small boys ranging from three to fifteen years of 
age, the brave little Irish widow in this story is obliged to leave her 
husband's farm and occupy a rude shanty in a small country town. She 
takes in washing and sends her sons to school. Her management and 
encouragement of them, amid poverty and trouble, the characters of 
the boys themselves, their cheerfulness, courage, and patience, and the 
firm grip which they take of the lowest rounds of the ladder of success, 
are told simply, forcibly, interestingly, and altogether delightfully.

Important Books Just Published. 

THE JEW, THE GYPSY, AND EL ISLAM. 

By the late Sir RICHARD F. BURTON, K.C.M.G., F.R.6.S., etc. Edited with a Preface and Brief Notes, 
by W. H. WILKINS, author of "The Romance of Isabel Lady Burton." In large demy 8vo. Cloth 
gilt, and gilt top, with Photogravure Portrait of the Author from picture by the late Lord Leighton. 
$3.50 net. 

The above book, which is not a translation but an original work, is composed, as the title indicates, of three 
parts, each separate and complete in itself. Of these, the first two, " The Jew " and " The Gypsy," are deeply 
interesting ethnological studies, containing the fruits of much personal observation and original research. The 
third part, " 1 Islam," is a profound and sympathetic study of the Mnhammadan religion. Thus the volume is 
made up of some of the most valuable of the unpublished Burton MSS., to which so much interest is attached, 
and forms an admirable example of the work of the famous Oriental traveler in fields which he made his own." 

44 The New Economy," a peaceful solution of the social problem, by LAURENCE GBONLUND, 
A.M., author of " The Cooperative Commonwealth," etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 
In his previous books the author has been criticised for his great dependence on theory, and not enough on 

fact. In his present work he proves how by simple and practical methods society can be materially changed within 

a short space of time. He advocates many new methods which will be found interesting and instructive, not only 

to students of sociology, but to the average reader as well. 

44 In the Cage," a novel by HENRY JAMES, author of "What Maisie Knew." 12mo. Cloth, 

uniform with " What Maisie Knew," $1.25. 

" We could not wish for a better representation of the art of Mr. Henry James. In appearance it is only a 
sketch of a girl who works the telegraph in an office that is part of a grocer's shop in the West End, but as 
background there is the extravagant world of fashion throwing out disjointed hints of vice and intrigue in mes- 
sages handed in as indifferently as if the operator were only part of the machine. Nevertheless, she is a woman 
too, and feminine interest and curiosity so quicken her wits that she is able to piece together ' the high encounter 
with life, the large and complicated game ' of her customers. This, in fact, is the romance in her life, the awak- 
ening touch to her imagination, and it is brought into skilful contrast with the passionless commonplace of her 
own love." Academy. 

44 A Golden Sorrow," by MARIA LOUISE POOL. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

This novel was running serially in Godey's Magazine at the time of Miss Pool's death. It will not, however, 
be completed in that periodical, but will be issued at once in book form. It is a story of love and adventure in 
St. Augustine, much more exciting than Miss Pool's stories usually are, but with all her delightful sense of humor. 

44 The Money Captain," a novel by WILL PAYNE. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

With " Jerry the Dreamer" Mr. Payne was first brought before the public. His present book treats, in fiction 
form, of the government of our cities by large private corporations and the difficulties a man with wide business 
interests has to conduct his affairs honestly. It does not aim to show any new solution of municipal problems, but, 
in a dispassionate way, points out how materially the average community is affected. 

44 A Slave to Duty, and Other Women," by OCTAVE THANET. 16mo. Cloth, illus- 
trated, $1.25. 
Miss French has such a thoroughly established reputation among the present reading public that no further 

introduction to this collection of short stories will be necessary than to say that it is on a par with her previous 

books. 

44 Chap- Book Stories," Second Series. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

This is the second collection of the best short stories from the Chap-Book. Many well-known names are 
included in the table of contents, and the volume will undoubtedly meet with the success which was accorded to 
the first volume of the series on its appearance two years ago. 

44 Etiquette for Americans." I6mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

It is probable that no woman thoroughly qualified to write upon this subject would be willing to sign her name 
to such a book. It is written by a person who is regarded all over the country as an authority upon the subject. 
Matters of good form are so constantly changing that there is at present a great need for a new book.

HOLIDAYS 1898=1899. 



NELSON'S NEW SERIES OF 

TEACHERS' BIBLES. 

New Illustrations, New Concordance, 

New Helps, New Maps. 

These Teachers' Bibles contain " The Illus- 
trated Bible Treasury," written by leading 
scholars in America and Great Britain, a new 
Indexed Bible Atlas. 

Upwards of 350 Illustrations 

of Ancient Monuments, Scenes in Bible Lands, 
Animals, Plants, Antiquities, Coins, etc., are dis- 
tributed through the text of the Helps, and a New 
Concordance to the Authorized and Revised Ver- 
sions, combined with a Subject-Index and pro- 
nouncing Dictionary of S cripture Proper Names. 

The Dial says: "The wealth of illustra- 
tions of the best sort not old worn-out cuts 
adds greatly to the beauty and completeness 
of the articles. The natural-history sections 
are especially fine in matter and make-up. The 
Concordance is the most complete yet produced, 
being adapted both to the Authorized and to 
the Revised Versions, and containing also 
proper names. We also find incorporated in it 
several themes which, in other ' Helps,' are 
found merely in separate sections under the dry 
uninteresting form of tables. Some of these 
are Messianic Prophecy, Parables in the Old 
Testament, Quotations in the New Testament 
for the Old. This feature simplifies the Bible 
student's task. ... Is nearest the ideal Bible 
student's manual of any publication in its field." 

The Sunday School Times, Sept. 17, 
1898, says : " The Nelson Teachers' Bible is of 
high grade. The illustrated Bible Treasury is 
a collection of helps more full than most others, 
and showing great care in preparation. For 
example, anyone who will compare its treatment 
of the geography, the topography, the astron- 
omy, zoology, mineralogy, botany, or the an- 
tiquities of the Bible, with similar matter to 
be found anywhere else, will find the compari- 
son greatly to the credit of this Bible. Another 
special excellence is that its Concordance covers 
the Revised Version as well as the old Version."

HASSAN: A Romance of Palestine 

By HENRY GILLMAN 

Mr. Gillman's powerful romance of the Holy Land as it is to-day is universally praised. It 
is the result of careful observation of the Fellaheen of Palestine. The Hero of Hassan," 
says the New York Times, " will be a revelation even to those who carry their ethnological 
studies beyond the realm of fiction." 

A biblical, patriarchal, pastoral spirit pervades it. Indeed, the whole book is 

From saturated with the author's reverence for the Holy Land, its legends, traditions, glory, 

The Independent misery, its romance, in a word and its one supreme glory, the impress of the 

Chosen of God and of the Master who walked among them. 

Mr. Gillman has certainly opened up a new field of fiction. The book is a marvel 

From of power, acute insight, and clever manipulation of thoroughly grounded truths. 

The Boston Herald There it no question that it lives and breathes. The story i at much a giant in fiction 

as its hero is among men. 

One feels that he has gained a wide knowledge of the customs, life, and condition 

p rom of modern Palestine that could only be otherwise had by a long residence in the 

Tfc A rt orrh*n<rr> country. The book is one that seems destined to take hold of the popular heart ax strongly 
as did "Ben Hur "or "Quo Vadis," nor is it less worthy of such popularity than either 
of those named. 

P The impression made by reading the book is like that of witnessing a great play, 

, . its scenes are so vivid, its characters so real, its surrounding horizon so picturesque,

IMPORTANT NSW NOVELS. 

DAVID HARUM. 

A Story of American Life. By EDWARD NOTES WESTCOTT. 

12mo. cloth, $1.50. 

" Mr. Westoott has created a new and Interesting type. We are led 
into a bright and sunny, although quaint, atmosphere. ' David Harum ' 
is a character entirely unlike those we have had from Dickens, Thack- 
eray, Charles Reade, or any of the English school. He is distinctly 
American, and yet his portrayal has awaited the band of Mr. Westoott, 
in spite of the activity of Miss Wllkins, Miss Jewell, and other*. . . . 
The writer has large knowledge of men and things. It is only when 
they are presented in such a bright and original light that we realise 
some of the things which are passing around us. A pleasing portrait of 
Newport life is incidentally painted for us in words that flash back the 
color of the various parts, and Newport means more (or less) than it 
did before. . . . The character sketching and building, so far as ' Lurid 
Harnm' is concerned, is well-nigh perfect. . . . The book is wonderfully 
bright, readable, and graphic." New York Time*. 

A HERALD OF THE WEST. 

An American Story of 1811-1815. By J. A. ALTSHELER, 
author of "A Soldier of Manhattan" and "The Sun of 
Saratoga." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"Mr. Altaheler has suddenly leaped almost to first place among 
writers of American historical romance. . . . A Herald of the West 
is a romance of our history which has not been surpassed in dramatic 
force, vivid coloring, and historical Interest. ... In these days when 
the flush of war has only just passed, the book ought to find thousands 
of readers, for it teaches patriotism without Intolerance, and it shows, 
what the war with Spain has demonstrated anew, the power of the 
American people when they are deeply roused by some great wrong." 
San Francitco Chronicle. 

HER MEMORY. 

By MAARTEN MAARTENS, author of "God's Fool," ''The 

Greater Glory," " Joost Avelingh," etc. Uniform edition. 

With photogravure portrait. I'-'nio, cloth, $1.50. 

" Maarten Maartens took us all by storm some time ago with his fine 

story christened ' God's Fool.' He established himself at once in our 

affections as a unique creature who had something to say and knew how 

to say It in the most fascinating way. He Is a serious story writer, who 

sprang into prominence when he first put his pen to paper, and who has 

ever since kept his work up to the standard of excellence which he first 

raised in the beginning. " New York Herald. 

THE PHANTOM ARMY. 

By MAX PKMBBRTON. Uniform with " Kronstadt." Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Pemberton has written a romantic novel characterised by con- 
tinued and increasing interest and stirring adventures. His hero, an 
English soldier of fortune, is enrolled through a strange series of inci- 
dents, in the " Phantom Army," which has its stronghold In the moun- 
tains of Spain, like certain of the Carlist bands of a few years since. 
The picturesqueness and dramatic quality of the tale will find imme- 
diate favor with readers.

1 Concerning Isabel Carnaby ' Is beyond doubt a book to be read. It 



is a book with a great deal of fresh and interesting observation in it ; the 
leading characters are really studied, and the detail Is obviously from

HAR OLD FREDERIC. 

American fiction could ill afford to lose so 
good a writer as Harold Frederic, who died at 
Henley, England, on the nineteenth of October. 
His reputation as a novelist was hardly more 
than ten years old, but it was firmly fixed, and 
we had come to think of him as one of our 
foremost story-tellers, as one to the growth of 
whose powers there was no readily assignable 
limit. That he should have been taken away 
in the very prime of life for he had only com- 
pleted his forty-second year is of itself a 
happening sufficiently tragic, and the tragedy 
becomes heightened by what is reported of the 
circumstances under which he died, for the 
despatches state that he had fallen into the 
hands of those fanatics who deny the efficacy 
of the scientific treatment of disease, and that 
he was refused the medical attendance which 
might, it is claimed, have averted the disaster 
of his early death. If this be true, a heavy 
indictment lies against those who were respon- 
sible for the neglect, and they stand condemned 
morally even if they are beyond the reach of 
the civil law. 

Harold Frederic was born on a farm in cen- 
tral New York, August 19, 1856, of an ancestry 
in which English, French, and Dutch elements 
were commingled. His childhood was familiar 
with poverty, and his schooling ended with his 
fourteenth year. Forced thus to become a self- 
educated man, his subsequent career gave evi- 
dence once more of the truth which some 
seek to minimise or even to deny that educa- 
tion is none the less education because a man 
gets it by his own unaided efforts that the 
education gained in this strenuous way may be 
of a more solid kind than that attested by a 
parchment certificate. After a few years of 
employment, first as office-boy, then as draughts- 
man, then as retoucher of photographic nega- 
tives, Frederic found himself landed in journal- 
ism, and speedily made his way to the front. 
At twenty- four, he was one of the editors of the 
Utica " Observer," at twenty-six, he became 
editor of the Albany " Evening Journal," at 
twenty-eight, he was engaged by the New York 
" Times," and sent to London, as correspond- 
ent for that newspaper. Since 1884, then, his 



290 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



career has been public property, and we are 
now left sadly wondering at the position he 
created for himself during the last fourteen 
years of his life, and at the amount of serious 
work that he had accomplished before he died. 

It was, we believe, in this first year of his 
English life, that we first saw the name Harold 
Frederic in print. It was signed to a short 
paper in the "Pall Mall Gazette," written 
by an American in London," and devoted to 
an account of the condition of literary affairs 
in the United States. We well remember ask- 
ing ourselves who this man could be, whose 
name was wholly unfamiliar, yet who wrote with 
so much assurance and intelligent grasp of his 
subject. It was not until some three years later 
that the name again attracted our attention, 
when it was attached to a striking story called 
" Seth's Brother's Wife," which began to appear 
serially in one of the magazines. From this time 
on which amounts to saying for the past ten 
years the name has been well known to all 
American readers, and has come to stand for 
good literary work, conscientiously performed, 
in whatever field of activity its owner might 
choose to engage. 

As a correspondent, Mr. Frederic's work has 
become very widely known indeed during recent 
years. His London letters, printed in a number 
of our leading newspapers, have been the most 
interesting of their kind, full of energy and ideas, 
bringing a trained mind to bear upon cur- 
rent questions of politics, society, and art, and 
embodying as much of style as could reasonably 
be expected of a writer who used the Atlantic 
cable for his instrument. Moreover, on at least 
two notable occasions, Mr. Frederic was not con- 
tent with providing for his American public the 
news supplied to his hand in London, but set out 
to obtain news of his own by direct investigation. 
It was in 1884, at the outset of his career as 
a newspaper correspondent, that he made a per- 
sonal inspection of the cholera-infected districts 
of Southern France and Italy. He visited Mar- 
seilles and Toulon in the days when the popu- 
lation of those cities was panic-stricken, and his 
letters upon the subject were an important con- 
tribution to our knowledge of the epidemic at 
a time when it was feared that even our own 
country was threatened with invasion by the 
dreaded plague. The second of the occasions 
referred to was in 1891, when the recrudescence 
of Jew-baiting in Russia was made the subject 
of a personal investigation by Mr. Frederic, the 
result of his observations being published the 
following year in a graphic and impressive work 



entitled " The New Exodus : A Study of Israel 
in Russia." 

This work, and the newspaper correspondence 
which he carried on for fourteen years, gave Mr. 
Frederic considerable prominence as a student 
of public affairs, and his firm grasp of political 
problems made him something of an authority 
upon contemporary history. All this work, 
however, is of a sort soon to be inevitably for- 
gotten because essentially ephemeral. But Mr. 
Frederic's fiction is not ephemeral, and has won 
for him a high place among American novelists. 
Eight volumes of that fiction have already been 
published, and two more will make the list com- 
plete. Ten volumes in ten years is not a bad 
record, when we consider that their author was 
by vocation a journalist, and a man of letters only 
by avocation, especially when we consider that 
the ten volumes are of a far higher character 
than the work of most journalists, that they are 
reasonably free from those touches of crudeness 
and vulgarity that few journalists are able to 
exclude from their attempts to produce literature 
of the serious sort. 

The ten volumes are these : " Seth's Broth- 
er's Wife" (1887), "The Lawton Girl" (1890), 
"In the Valley" (1890), "The Return of 
the O'Mahony" (1892), "The Copperhead" 
(1894), " Marsena, and Other Stories of the 
War" (1895), "The Damnation of Theron 
Ware" (1896), "March Hares" (1896), 
" Gloria Mundi " (1898), and " The Market 
Place," promised for publication next year. 
Of the eight volumes that are already contained 
between covers, " March Hares " and " The 
Return of the O'Mahony " are extravaganzas, 
and stand apart from the rest. Neither of them 
would we willingly miss, for they display a richly 
humorous side of the author's fancy, the exist- 
ence of which would hardly be suspected by read- 
ers of his other novels. The second of the two 
just named, in particular, has never enjoyed half 
the popularity it deserves ; for exuberant vital- 
ity it outranks the others, although this char- 
acter is doubtless gained at the expense of more 
artistic qualities. From the other six novels 
that stand on the shelf, " In the Valley" stands 
apart as a work of historical fiction, in the sense 
that it deals with a bygone period. We make 
this distinction because all of the six are histori- 
cal in a wide but very genuine sense of the term. 
Of " In the Valley," which deals with the Revo- 
lutionary period of our history, and with the 
events that prepared the way for an American 
victory at Saratoga, we do not hesitate to say 
that it is one of the best historical novels that

THE DIAL

we have, a strong and vivid portrayal of one 
of the most stirring and pregnant periods in our 
national annals. 

Five books remain for a few words of char- 
acterization. They all deal with the region and 
the period that the author knew so well, the 
central New York of the sixties, seventies, and 
eighties. They accomplish for that region and 
that period the work of analysis and portraiture 
that so many of our writers are doing for other 
regions and contemporary periods. Two of them 
reproduce for us the feeling with which the old 
North viewed the Civil War, and show us the 
cross-currents of sentiment and the conflicting 
passions that divided non-combatants as well 
as combatants. Two others are more strictly 
domestic in their interest. The fifth, by com- 
mon consent Mr. Frederic's most successful 
novel, has for its theme the warfare waged by 
two religious ideals in the battle-field of a man's 
soul ; but even this powerful work is at the same 
time a richly observant study of provincial 
American society. We may perhaps be per- 
mitted to quote, in closing, a few words that we 
wrote of this powerful fiction at the time of its 
appearance two years ago : " Mr. Frederic has 
aimed to produce a great and typical picture 
of American life, and an unerring instinct has 
taught him that such a picture must be con- 
cerned with the life of a small community rather 
than with the more attractive but also more 
sophisticated civilization of the great cities. 
It is in the small community that the main- 
springs of a nation's strength are to be felt most 
distinctly and the elements of its weakness most 
clearly discerned ; it is here that its fundamen- 
tal ideals are most naively offered to the view." 
These words were written of " The Damnation 
of Theron Ware," but their application extends 
to the greater number of Mr. Frederic's novels, 
and for this reason they are here reproduced. 



THE B TGONE L TCE UM. 

When, in the early thirties, Emerson, cut adrift 
from his church and his livelihood, began his forty 
years of platform work, the American lecturing sys- 
tem may be said to have its most definite beginnings. 
It is the old story of the mustard seed : there has 
sprung up a great tree, and the European celebrities 
come and lodge in the branches. Its like has existed 
nowhere else in quite such luxuriance. When 
Archibald Forbes thought of a lecturing tour in 
England, after the Russo-Turkish war, he had no 
precedents, and was forced to barnstorm the country 
under the guidance of a theatrical manager. Jona- 



than's lecturing machinery was still a " foreign 
devil " to John Bull, for America, which led the way 
in establishing an organized system, has all along 
retained pretty much what a furnisher would call an 
exclusive design. 

The unit of the system in its completeness was 
the Lyceum, the idea of which is now concrete only 
to the old and middle-aged, and whose rise, decline, 
and fall have yet to find their historian. In a gen- 
eral way, the term denotes the various organizations 
which, flourishing or languishing as the local ther- 
mometers of " culture " registered high or low, once 
existed in city and village alike throughout the North- 
ern States, with the improvement of the community 
as their especial aim, and the delectable exhibition, in 
courses of lectures covering the winter months, of the 
intellectual lions of the day as a corollary. It is 
difficult for the present generation to realize the im- 
portance of this institution ; the weekly lecture was 
the social event before which all other engagements 
must needs give way, and it often stood in lieu of the 
inaccessible theatre or the forbidden dance. 

The history of popular lecturing in this country 
would seem to fall into three periods: the first, 
roughly bounded, ends with the Civil War ; the 
second, some twelve years ago ; while the third is 
still with us. Of the early days, and Emerson's 
first Boston lectures, we have a sympathetic picture. 
" Who that saw the audience," says Lowell, " will 
ever forget it, where everyone still capable of fire, 
or longing to renew in himself the half-forgotten 
sense of it, was gathered ? Those faces, young and 
old, agleam with pale intellectual light, eager with 
pleased attention, flash upon me once more from 
the deep recesses of the years with an exquisite 
pathos. ... I hear again that rustle of sensation, 
as they turned to exchange glances over some pithier 
thought, some keener flash of that humor which 
always played about the horizon of his mind like 
heat-lightning, and it seems now like the sad whisper 
of the autumn leaves that are whirling around me." 

Other men of letters followed Emerson, and lec- 
turing began to grow in favor. It paid but meagrely 
at first. Holmes tells a story of " Emerson's coming 
to my house to know if I could fill his place at a cer- 
tain Lyceum so that he might accept a very advan- 
tageous invitation in another direction. I told him 
that I was engaged for the evening mentioned. He 
smiled serenely, saying that then he supposed he 
must give up the new stove for that season." By 
the time of the war, the lecturing field was crowded 
and the Lyceum system widespread. There is in 
the possession of the writer a bundle of old letters to 
whose yellowed paper and faded ink the signatures 
of men famous in literature and public affairs lend 
a revitalizing touch. They all pertain to lecturing, 
and were written during the Civil War to the sec- 
retary of a Lyceum in a town of western New York. 
Here are letters from statesmen, judges, bishops, 
war correspondents, editors, men of letters, mer- 
chants, lawyers, philanthropists, orators, and trav- 
ellers ; from politicians who were too busy to lee- 



292 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



tare and politicians who had little else to do, poet* open 
to persuasion and a poet who could not be lured, 
a man who had been president and men who were 
ambitions to be president ; and, not the least interest- 
ing, letters from the Lyceum secretaries who talked 
of the great ones for whom they were angling as 
though they were commodities to be bought and sold. 

Those were the days of the giants, but the giants 
had their host of pygmy imitators, and in perusing 
these old letters no point is more striking than the 
present comparative nnfamiliarity of the names of 
most of their authors. What, for example, do the 
names of MacGowan, Edwin James, Murdoch, or 
even the once celebrated E. H. Chapin, now mean 
to us? What legacy has been left us by Richards, 
who used to sugar-coat science for the crowd, and 
whose popularity permitted matinees for children? 
Where, outside the annals of journalism, do we 
meet with the names of W. C. Prime, Manton 
Marble, or Benjamin F. Taylor? Yet all had their 
vogue, and this one sentence of Taylor's, " My pro- 
tracted absence with the Army of the Cumberland 
has served to confuse my lecturing arrangements," 
is indicative that there were those among them who 
stood near the pulse of the stirring life of the time. 
Bishops Clark and Simpson, good men both, the 
latter the man whom Lincoln regarded as the great- 
est orator he had heard, are shadowy figures ; and 
to how many to-day comes as a familiar sound the 
name of " Edmund Kirke," the pen-name of J. R. 
Gilmore, who was at one time entrusted with what 
proved a bootless mission to the Confederacy ? 
What memories of defunct issues that once were 
live are stirred by this voice from the past : " My 
subject," he writes, " will be ' The Southern Whites : 
their characteristics, and their relation to the future 
of the Union.' It will, naturally, be largely de- 
scriptive and humorous, but while it will contain 
nothing to offend the abolitionist or anti-abolitionist, 
it will give the Vallandigham school of Copperheads 
4 Hail Columbia.' I wish this distinctly understood 
and assented to by you, as, like a certain old lady of 
everybody's acquaintance, I like to have ' my say.' " 

This was the season of 1863-4, and the men of 
affairs found other wine-presses to tread. Thus, 
Seward, writing from Washington, pleads in ex- 
cuse that " my engagements obliged so early a re- 
turn to this place." " I shall be required at Wash- 
ington," writes Fernando Wood ; and Washington 
again claims the presence of Holt, the Judge- 
Advocate General. Henry Winter Davis's duties 
" are too engrossing." " With my present engage- 
ments," says Charles Sumner, " I dare not promise 
myself." Reverdy Johnson's outlook is certain to 
keep me in work "; Edward Everett has " not ac- 
cepted any invitations to speak the ensuing season "; 
ex-President Franklin Pierce declines without ex- 
planations ; and Wendell Phillips, in a scrawl that 
speaks of haste more than his assertion of the fact 
at the close, with a half promise, thrusts the whole 
consideration of the matter months forward into 
the uncertain future. 



These men, however, with the exception of 
Phillips, were hardly " regulars " in the lecturing 
phalanx which Emerson indisputably led. Among 
the professional lecturers, few were more sought 
after than John B. Gough and Henry Ward 
Beecher. Gough's agent announces by circular that 
he is booked for months to come ; and one of the 
Lyceum secretaries states on the eve of Beecher's 
return from his memorable trip to England : " There 
is a pile of letters a foot high waiting his arrival, 
all of which relate to lectures." 

Another favorite was the comedian James H. 
Hackett, the Falstaff of his generation, who found 
time outside his theatrical work for occasional read- 
ings. He was much in demand, but difficult to pin 
down to a definite date, and there are in my pile 
several letters in his nervous, old-fashioned hand, 
anent one of the attempts to secure him. He makes 
an interesting confession as to his professional re- 
wards. He had received an offer of $100 from 
Albany, a compensation which, he asserts, " ap- 
proached nearer to such as I can obtain by four 
nights acting upon the stage." 

Naturally, in a collection like this there are letters 
from such platform celebrities as Curtis, Holmes, 
Holland, Bayard Taylor, and Anna Dickinson ; but 
their correspondence contains but little of general 
interest. Curtis was then in the thick of that strug- 
gle to liquidate a publishing-house debt which he 
might have legally avoided, but which, like Scott, 
he chose to shoulder. The five letters in his hand, 
trifling though they are, reflect everywhere the 
" heart of courtesy " which this first gentleman of 
America so markedly possessed. Holmes's letters, 
like everything he touched, bear the imprint of his 
personality. This is rather a model declination : 
" I have got tripped up at starting," he says, in 
breaking an engagement by reason of sickness. " I 
hate to disappoint an audience as much as any lec- 
turer can. I have strong personal motives for car- 
rying out my plan for that lecturing trip during that 
vacation. Nothing but necessity would have forced 
me to relinquish it, and that I am sure will prove a 
sufficient apology." This same Lyceum also made 
an attempt to entice Longfellow. In a dainty mon- 
ogrammed note from Nahant the poet replied : It 
would give me great pleasure to accept your invita- 
tion if I ever appeared in the character of lecturer. 
As I do not, I must decline." 

The drama of the present was at that period too 
absorbing for interest in things literary or philo- 
sophic, and the subjects proposed in these letters 
are, with rare exceptions, pertinent to the struggle 
then in progress. Thus, we have " The Southern 
Whites," " The State of the Country," " The Prob- 
able Issues of the War," "The Way of Peace," 
"The National Heart," and "The Crisis of the 
Nation." Politics, hitherto tabooed from the Ly- 
ceum, began to overshadow all else. 

From the point of view of our day, when the best- 
known lecturers receive from three to five hundred 
dollars a night, and Stanley toured the country at 



1898.]

the rate of a hundred and ten thousand dollars for 
a hundred and ten lectures, the prices paid these 
men seem paltry. A hundred dollars was then con- 
sidered munificent hire for a Lyceum lecture, and 
equally so, it is likely, in many instances by the 
lecturers themselves. Both Gough and Beecher 
could ask and easily get a hundred and fifty dollars ; 
Holmes, Agassiz, Phillips, Butler, and Everett 
valued their services at one hundred dollars ; Bayard 
Taylor was satisfied with sixty ; and George William 
Curtis, with a modesty that is characteristic, rated 
himself in the fifty-dollar category with Manton 
Marble, Benjamin F. Taylor, Bishop Clark, and 
Charles Carleton Coffin. 

After the war, conditions changed. Up to this 
time the lecturers had been largely their own busi- 
ness managers, and dependent upon the invitations 
they might receive. A tendency toward centraliza- 
tion of management now set in. The Lyceums of 
the West pooled their interests in the securing of 
prominent lecturers from the East, and suggested, 
it is likely, by this came the establishment of bu- 
reaus for the supply of the Lyceums and the intro- 
duction of the methods which have been stigmatized 
as " lecture brokerage." Prices rose, and by the 
early seventies, and the coming of Major Pond 
the Warwick of the modern lecture-world, who 
infused a new spirit into the business the organ- 
ized machine got fairly under way. Illustrative of 
the change which came about, it may be said that 
Curtis latterly received from two hundred to three 
hundred and fifty dollars a lecture, and Gough's 
annual income from this source exceeded thirty 
thousand dollars. 

In the changed conditions, however, were the 
beginnings of the downfall of the Lyceum. The 
rise in prices brought a natural influx of mediocrity 
into the field, which cheapened the abler men and 
degraded the Lyceum system into what Dr. Holland 
characterized as " a string of entertainments that 
have no earnest purpose, and minister to no manly 
and womanly want." As early as 1868, Colonel 
Higginson noted a change of tone and the passing 
of the orthodox Lyceum lecture. " The scholar," 
he wrote, " recedes from sight, and the impassioned 
orator takes his place." By 1874 the decline of the 
Lyceum itself had obviously begun. The platform 
was losing its former leaders the men who bad 
given America a literature, who had made the Ly- 
ceum's existence possible, who had denounced slav- 
ery, and who had taught the liberty of conscience, 
and the public was offered the stimulus of music 
and operatic effects to relieve the tedium of its lec- 
tures. Popular interest flagged more and more, 
until now, although " there are more lectures given 
than ever before," as Major Pond said in a recent 
letter to the writer, " a regular Lyceum course is 
known only in the memory of the people past mid- 
dle life." 

There has succeeded the period of " stars." For- 
eign invaders, with high hopes of plunder, are ever 
among us with varying fortunes ; the Conan Doyles 



fail where the Ian MacLarens prosper; our own 
men of letters still lecture, but in the main before 
some convention, or at some civic, reform, or liberal 
club dinner. The old-time Lyceum audience whose 
average portrait the " Autocrat " has drawn so well 
no longer gathers. " Front seats : a few old folks, 
shiny-headed, slant up best ear towards the 
speaker, drop off asleep after awhile, when the air 
begins to get a little narcotic with carbonic acid. 
Bright women's faces, young and middle-aged, a 
little behind these, but toward the front, ( pick 
out the best and lecture mainly to that). Here and 
there a countenance sharp and scholarlike, and a. 
dozen pretty female ones sprinkled about. An 
indefinite number of pairs of young people, happy, 
but not always very attentive. Boys in the back- 
ground, more or less quiet. Dull faces, here, there, 
in how many places ! I do n't say dull people, 
but faces without a ray of sympathy or a movement 
of expression. They are what kill the lecturer. 
These negative faces, with their vacuous eyes and 
stony lineaments, pump and suck the warm soul out 
of him ; that is the chief reason why lecturers 
grow so pale before the season is over." 

The lapse of four decades precludes the gathering 
again of that audience. The fact that we are now 
intellectually almost one country, and not several 
differing provinces, has stripped the lecturer of 
something of the glamor attached to that which is 1 
foreign. His message has preceded him. " When 
all can read, and books are plentiful, lectures are 
unnecessary," is the dictum of Dr. Johnson, which ' 
Miss Repplier tellingly quotes in her "Gentle Warn- 
ing to Lecturers," and it perhaps best explains why 
the real Lyceum belongs to the past, and what 
makes improbable a true renaissance. For although 
the University Extension movement is a legitimate 
child of the Lyceum, the revival of lecture courses 
brought about by its influence is a thing apart. 

The good which the Lyceum wrought it is impos- 
sible to estimate. A " general toleration of all men 
and all opinions," " the education of the public taste 
in intellectual amusements," a higher " standard of 
excellence in English and its utterance," and the 
untiring championship of " universal liberty," 
these Dr. Holland regarded as foremost among the 
quickening influences of the popular lecture while 
the Lyceum was yet undegenerate.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"WOULD BETTER" FOR "HAD BETTER." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In this part of the English-speaking world there has 
sprung up of late years a form of expression that is 
becoming wide-spread, at least in colloquial, newspaper,, 
and schoolmaster English; it has not been used by any 
good writer that I know of. Attention has never been 
called to it, so far as I have observed, and I bring it up 
merely to find out to what extent the usage is becoming

general. I refer to the use of " would better " for the 
idiomatic "had better" in such sentences as these: 
" You would better see about it yourself." " The man 

who meditates throwing out of the convention 

would better put on asbestos gloves before trying it." 

The origin of such an unidiomatic, illogical locution 
may be due to the schoolmaster's diagram, which in 
general tends to level the idioms of our speech to the 
weak, insipid English more easily analysed by the 
diagram-formulfe, a passing fad in English instruc- 
tion, at least here in the West, that has done more harm 
than its advocates are aware of. I know nothing more 
destructive of idiomatic, and hence effective, English 
speech than the popular school methods of parsing and 
diagramming. 

Another explanation I offer is, that " would better " 
for " had better " may have arisen in the common speech 
by analogy with " would rather " for " had rather," both 
of which are in good use. It seems more likely, how- 
ever, to be a conscious effort on the part of the purist, 
regardless of idiom, to put his speech in accord with his 
notions of grammatical correctness. 

"You had better" is, in the process of evolution, 
from an earlier " You were better " (Anglo-Saxon Eoto 
waere betere), meaning " It were [would be] better for 
you." You, originally a dative, came, in time, to be 
mistaken, on account of its position, for a nominative, 
as in " If you please," and the usage then became ex- 
tended, as in Shakespeare's "She were better love a 
dream " (T. N., 2. 2), " I were better to be eaten to 
death" (2 Hen. IV., 1. 2), with which compare in Ba- 
con's Essays, " For certainly, you were better take for 
Businesse a Man somewhat Absurd than over Formall " 
(" Of Seeming Wise "), and " In a word, a Man were 
better relate himself to a Statua, or Picture, then to suffer 
his Thoughts to pass in smother" ("Of Friendship"). 

" You were better " became in time " you had better," 
probably by analogy with such forms as " had come," 
44 had gone," for earlier " were come," 4 were gone," 
according to the prevailing rule for the conjugation of 
intransitive verbs, as in modern German. 

But no man with Anglo-Saxon instincts, or with red 
blood in his veins, is going to use " would better " either 
in speaking or in writing. It is uuhistorical, unidio- 
matic, and defies all logical analysis.

THE MUSES AND THE CUBAN WAR. 

(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Students of early poetry have heard more or less of the 
theory of 4I communal authorship," according to which 
primitive poetry just grew, without having any author 
at all in the modern sense of the term. However much 
truth or falsehood there may be in this view, there is a 
sense in which certain kinds of verse have a communal 
genesis. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe was to all practical 
intents and purposes the author of that soul-stirring war 
lyric, 

" Mine eves have Mem the glory of the coming of the Lord, 
He is trampling out his vintage where the grapes of wrath 

are stored," 

but she was something more than its individual author; 
and that is, the point at which the electrical force of a 
Nation's deep and unified moral feeling was discharged. 
Granted the highest possible poetic genius, and yet she 
could never have produced that particular poem under 



any other condition than that of a great people swayed 
by the deep feeling which it expresses. And this gives 
us a key to the problem of Cuban War lyrics which 
some of your correspondents have recently raised. If 
the masses were pervaded by a deep, unified, and well- 
defined moral sentiment in the recent struggle, then the 
friends of the muses have reason for serious concern 
over the failure of that struggle to produce even one 
lyric which could be put by the side of such work as 
Mrs. Howe's " Battle-Hymn " without betraying at once 
its utter lack of the qualities necessary to really great 
war verse. We &&y failure without any hesitation; a 
war lyric of the higher type will sing itself into the 
hearts of the people at once, without waiting to be 
hunted up and introduced by the students of literature. 
If, then, this unified moral feeling was present and could 
not find utterance, poetical ability must be at a very 
low ebb among us. If, however, (we make the sugges- 
tion with fear and trembling) there was no unification 
of moral sentiment; if any chance group of citizens who 
met together took about as many different views of the 
war as there were individuals present; if the less intel- 
ligent classes were confessedly following the yellow 
journals; if the thinking classes were either wholly con- 
vinced, or even strongly suspicious, that there would 
have been no war except for these same journals and 
the baser element in Congress; if even those who were 
hearty believers in the war for it* declared purpose fore- 
saw the inevitable movement to carry it far beyond that 
purpose, and into regions of doubtful expediency and 
morality, then we may easily take the most hopeful 
view of current poetical ability in America, and still 
feel no surprise that the verse of the struggle rose no 
higher than strained rhetoric about the eagle and the 
flag, ingenious quips about bottling fleets, etc. These 
alternatives are sincerely believed by the writer to cover 
the entire ground : " The lady or the tiger 1 " Let each 
reader decide for himself. iff, jj. JOHNSON.

NATIONAL PRIDE AND HISTORICAL ACCURACY. 

(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Spanish historians may be trusted to give a good ac- 
count of themselves when the time comes for them to 
chronicle the naval events of the late war in a way as 
little mortifying as possible to the pride of posterity. 
Much ingenuity and perhaps some lying may be looked 
for. But in the art of extracting balm, and even mat- 
ter of gratification, from a tale of national disaster, the 
Spaniards can hardly hope to outdo the average British 
historian of the naval actions of the war of 1812. The 
latest considerable British writer to distinguish himself 
in this respect is Mr. Charles Oman. In his for the 
most part capital little " History of England," Mr. Oman, 
after cautiously admitting that "on three successive 
occasions " in 1812 the English frigates engaged had 
possibly a shade the worst of it, goes on cheerfully to 
say that " In course of time the American vessels were 
hunted down and destroyed by our squadrons " ! This 
belated bit of " war news " ought to prove as agreeable 
a surprise to most of Mr. Oman's countrymen as did 
Mr. Cunningham Grabame's discovery that Dewey's 
victory at Manila was won by British gunners. Seri- 
ously, it is a comfort to know that such preposterous 
slips as the one cited above are extremely rare in Mr. 
Oman's widely used histories. W. R. K.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY, NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL..* 

The essays gathered together by Professor 
Woolsey have already been separately given to 
the public in recent years as contributions to 
periodicals, and bear the marks of their original 
destination in an occasional sketchiness and 
some repetition. They deal with the Cuban 
Question, the future of Hawaii and the Philip- 
pines, the Interoceanic Canal, the Fisheries 
Question, the Arbitration Treaty of 1897, and 
" The President's Monroe Doctrine." Although 
a number of the questions here discussed have 
reached stages of development hardly to be fore- 
told when these essays were written, the book is 
to be welcomed by those who now seek the true 
solutions. The same deliberate and judicial 
mind that marked the elder Woolsey appears in 
all these pages, and they must appeal to a very 
large class of thoughtful men, not because they 
say anything unexpected, but because they ap- 
peal to and fortify a kindred habit of mind. 

Mr. Powers, on the other hand, in a most 
remarkable and able paper, goes deeper, and 
breaks new ground for thought. He asks the 
question, why it is that the American people, 
in the course of one brief year, seem to have 
changed so radically their attitude with refer- 
ence to foreign policy. Before this recent war 
came upon us, the great mass of Americans 
were content to say " America for the Ameri- 
cans," and to leave the Old World to its own 
areas and its own devices. To-day the same 
great majority contemplate with jocund serenity 
the annexation of Porto Rico perchance of 
Cuba and, going far overseas, of Hawaii and 
the Philippines. A second question follows : 
Does this change betoken a revolution in Amer- 
ican national purposes, or is it merely a revela- 
tion a revelation of a hitherto unrecognized 
stream of tendency ? Mr. Powers decides for 
the latter, and proceeds most forcibly to illus- 
trate his thesis. Washington's advice, in his 
farewell address, when he urged avoidance of 
political entanglements with the Old World, 
and pointed the gaze westward upon our great 
undeveloped continent, was a warning. Rec- 
ognizing already the rising tendencies of his

of Political and Social Science. 



indefatigable fellow-countrymen to " go in and 
possess the land," he anxiously directed their 
attention along the line of least resistance 
toward the interior of their own continent. But 
the bounds that Washington's dying gaze rested 
on were too strait ; and within four years, 
Jefferson, the strict constructionist, voicing the 
American mind, first tested the elasticity of the 
Constitution in the annexation of Louisiana 
a land of alien race and alien institutions, and 
as far away from the banks of the Potomac as 
are the Philippines to-day. Again in 1848, 
by force and the sword, we entered upon the 
possessions of another alien race possessions 
which were removed from our borders by sup- 
posed deserts, more difficult of passage than a 
Pacific Ocean. So too, in 1866, we bought 
an outlying domain, far from our centres df 
population, and not to be reached across Amer- 
ican soil. Thus a trend of national expansion, 
regardless of alien race and institutions, or of 
physical barriers, has been set up, which recent 
events, according to Mr. Powers, but further 
express, although he emphasizes the fact that 
now for the first time this trend brings us face to 
face with races beyond our powers of assimila- 
tion, with climates beyond our powers of adapta- 
tion, with neighbors fully as strong as ourselves. 
If to-day we ask for the reasons in favor of 
the forward policy which the Spanish War has 
made attractive to so many minds, we are fur- 
nished with a goodly number, each with its 
special group of advocates. We are told by 
some that the glorious Star-spangled Banner 
should never recede from any spot on which it 
has been planted, and this for mere sentiment's 
sake, regardless of the right or wrong that 
placed it there. Others speak of our " mis- 
as the most intelligent and most devel- 



son 



oped of the nations, to carry our civilization 
and our institutions into less favored lands, and 
thus to preach liberty, fraternity, equality. 
Many ambitious masters of industry see the 
commercial fields of the oldest East lying ripe 
for a grand harvest, and desire to take posses- 
sion of them for Yankee exploitation. From 
not a few of the religious newspapers and as- 
semblies comes a similar idea as regards the 
great field of heathenism, which offers them an 
adundant opportunity, once covered by our 
national flag. More thoughtful men than any 
of these tell us that in virtue of a situation 
which is new, yet into which we as a nation 
have drifted, a new responsibility now exists as 
a fact, whether we like it or not. Others, again, 
concede the strangeness and the risk of all that

now seems impending, but console themselves 
and us with the proposition that this coming 
touch with the larger world of international 
affairs will sober and steady us as a nation, 
banish shirt-sleeve diplomacy " from our ser- 
vice, and enable us to stand among the peoples 
of the earth respecting and respected. 

Those who think differently cannot afford to 
brush all these arguments aside with impatience, 
as they safely may do with the first. They must 
rather give reasons for the faith that is in them, 
and present their counter-plea. They ask, then, 
in the name of consistency, what was the pro- 
claimed purpose of this war, and how the Amer- 
ican people can stand before the gaze of the 
world, and especially of our neighbor republics 
to the southward, if a war of liberation and 
humanity is diverted into a land-grabbing ex- 
ploit. They emphasize with prolonged empha- 
sis the home needs of this nation, and ask if all 
its surplus energy is not demanded to solve the 
weighty problems political, financial, and 
social that to-day confront us. They point 
to " the machine," overshadowing and imper- 
illing all our free institutions ; they note the 
arrested development in the whole matter of 
currency reform, where the prospect seemed so 
bright less than a year ago ; they suggest that 
the claims of organized labor and the peril of 
organized capital need the full attention of all 
our minds, if catastrophe is to be averted from 
the republic. Again, they assure us that while 
it is true that the annexations of Louisiana, of 
Texas, of the farther West, of Alaska, mark a 
century's trend and were made through con- 
quest not only of alien institutions, but also of 
obstacles of remoteness and inaccessibility, the 
present situation lures us to a sphere of empire 
differing in kind from all that preceded it. 
They dwell with eloquent words on the barriers 
of race, of climate, of Old World cabals and 
armaments. But the argument culminates in 
the thesis that democratic government and 
colonial administration for inferior races are 
essentially antagonistic. Democracy in its very 
essentials offers to the world not only freedom 
but equality ; it knows no dependent classes, no 
clients ; it dare not withhold from anyone a 
share in the disposal of his own destiny. 
Colonial government, on the other hand, is the 
work of a benevolent despotism, and is best 
administered by an autocracy or an aristocracy 
witness the colonial history of Great Britain 
and of Holland. Moreover, it is the work, 
when not characterized by maladministration, 
of a trained civil service which has been spe- 



cialized and made efficient and expert by more 
than a century of experience with its warning 
failures and its stimulating successes. Such a 
system must grow on each soil ; it cannot be 
borrowed or imitated. 

The advocate of " the old ways " concedes 
and accepts Mr. Powers's fruitful thought 
that we stand but on the highest point of a ris- 
ing wave : that natural law has expressed itself 
in a century's trend. But he also suggests that 
the natural law in the social sphere is but the 
resultant of multitudinous forces, and of these 
every man's opinion is one. For thirty years, 
nearly, before the Civil War, the whole trend 
in the North seemed to be toward abstention 
from any meddling with the " peculiar institu- 
tion "; yet a few " inspired fools," from Garrison 
to Sumner and Mrs. Stowe, set up a small 
movement which finally mastered and changed 
the trend and made a stream as wide as the 
North, on which were borne the Emancipation 
Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment. 

To-day a class of thoughtful minds, scattered 
throughout the land, seek to sway and master 
the trend. They point the American people to 
their true mission, consecrated by a hundred 
years of historic existence. It is to present to 
the warring Old World a continent over which 
the Pax Americana holds sway ; throughout 
which a great people have come to realize that 
the arts of peace are nobler than those of war. 
It is to continue to hold ever before Old World 
faces the best model of a free government ; one 
which helped to make the Revolutions of 1789 
and 1848, and has brought every nation in 
Europe but Russia and Turkey to constitutional 
government. It is to find in the intense indi- 
vidualism of American life its greatest leverage 
on the world at large, rather than in any group 
action. They cite the experience of the past 
and of the ever-living present to assure the 
trader and the churchman that American goods 
and American apostles equally are in the fore 
front of every market and every mission, re- 
gardless of national boundaries, that indus- 
trial alertness and missionary ardor are more 
potent than even " old Glory." They ask a 
nation with such an historic mission and such 
national characteristics to set their faces calmly 
against the pleadings of the new imperialism ; to 
set their allies in Cuba and in the Philippines 
on their feet ; to give them the chance that our re- 
moteness fully as much as our prowess gave us in 
the days of our Revolution ; and to make them 
a part of these United States only when by their 
own act they seek it. JOHN J. HALSET.

A LATTER-DAY NOVELIST ON DlCKENS.* 

I have labored of late, but without striking 
success, to establish a parallel between the three 
chief novelists of fifty years ago and the three 
chief novelists of to-day, or, at least, English 
novelists. Of course there is no very good 
reason why eminent masters of fiction should 
appear by groups of three (nor, indeed, do 
they), nor why, when they do so appear, they 
should represent homologous tendencies. Still, 
Mr. Meredith and Thackeray are on the whole 
more alike in general spirit and intention than 
either is like Mr. George Moore. And Mr. 
George Moore and George Eliot are more alike, 
as concerns the topics that preoccupy them, than 
they are like Mr. Gissing. And Mr. Gissing 
is much like Dickens, of whom he has written 
a book which is naturally very interesting. 

I admit that there are differences between 
the author of " Middlemarch " and the author 
of " Evelyn Innes." Both are realists, it is 
true ; but then, so are many other people. The 
real point of contact is that both are absorbed 
in questions of conscience. Mr. George Moore's 
books are often thought to be immoral, and 
George Eliot's are, on the other hand, very 
improving. But both authors are chiefly inter- 
ested in the conscience as such ; they consider 
their characters chiefly as moral agents, and 
that is not a very usual point of interest. Few 
novelists are natural historians of the con- 
science : Hawthorne was, but there are not 
many others. George Eliot stood alone in that 
absorption in her time, just as Mr. George 
Moore does to-day. A case of conscience is 
enough to interest either of them, without any- 
thing else. Now this is not so with Thackeray, 
nor with Mr. Meredith. Neither of these fancy 
that the world is merely a moral opportunity. 
The world to them is more complex, has many 
other factors beside the moral factor, other fac- 
tors quite as interesting ; its people do things 
without knowing whether they are right or 
wrong, and without our knowing, either. Such 
as the world is, they intellectualize it ; they see 
it, or rather they make us see it, in a medium, 
their medium, of style and way of thought as 
well ; they exhibit it as indulgent critics or as 
friendly impresarios ; they stand by you as you 
are absorbed by the comedy, and sometimes 
whisper epigrammatic comment on the inside 
history of the green-room, or they explain why 
the scenery creaks. 

* CHARLES DICKENS : A Critical Study. By George Gissing. 
New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



This is not the case with Dickens or with 
Mr. Gissing. Each of these goes, or tries to go, 
flatfooted down into his world with his photo- 
graph and phonograph. It is true that they are 
men of very different gifts : Dickens's gift of 
humor alone is enough to separate him from Mr. 
Gissing in most minds, as well as from anybody 
else. But what is their aim ? Dickens's aim was 
certainly not merely to be funny : he had some 
other aim than that. If it turn out to be the 
same as Mr. Gissing's, there is good reason for 
hoping that the latter will see sympathetically 
the strong points of his great predecessor. This 
is what we want. Dickens's weak points we 
are painfully aware of. We are so aware of 
them that we can hardly read his books nowa- 
days on account of finding nothing to make up 
to us for the tediousness of his extravagances. 

Yet the average reader, perhaps, would say 
that no one could understand Dickens less than 
the sad-faced and sad-minded Mr. Gissing. I 
call him sad-faced, because all the pictures I 
have seen of him (mostly on the outside of 
paper editions of his novels) are sad-faced ; and 
I call him sad-minded because I have met many 
who thought his novels very sad. I think it 
was the " New York Times " which, in review- 
ing "The Whirlpool," could find no more 
cheerful expressions in which to characterize it 
than "dreary," " uncourageous pessimism," 
"pitifully shabby," "no attempt at humor," 
" sluggishness of circulation." " His mind," 
says this appreciation, " is possessed by images 
of hopeless misery." How very different from 
Dickens, who delighted to fill his mind with 
imaginations of the most sanguine cheerfulness. 

Yet no one regards Dickens as merely a cheer- 
ful humorist. He thought of himself certainly 
as much more, and so do we when we read his 
books. And as a novelist he certainly had dis- 
tinct aims. Nothing would have induced him 
to write like Disraeli. He could not have un- 
derstood the desire to write like Thackeray. He 
had his own field. 

" We must dig deeper, get to untouched 
social strata," says one of Mr. Gissing's char- 
acters in an early novel. " Dickens felt this, 
but he had not the courage to face his subjects ; 
his monthly numbers had to lie on the family 
tea-table." 

We shall probably have our doubts as to the 
latter part here : it was not so much that 
Dickens was afraid to present Nancy as she 
really was, as that he habitually thought of her 
as other than she was. But the first part seems

social strata ; he had love and sympathy for an 
immense world which had been conceived nn- 
literary save in ignorant caricatures. And 
herein he resembles Mr. Gissing, and this gives 
Mr. Gissing an advantage in thinking over 
Dickens's work. 

Of course, in another way Mr. Gissing stands 
quite apart from Dickens. He is an Artist in 
the current sense of the word ; and Dickens is 
not, precisely. Dickens wrote with much con- 
sideration, certainly, and remarkably well, too. 
But he, like Scott, regarded himself rather 
more as one whose office it was to entertain and 
amuse the public than as a servant of the rigor- 
ous mistress raised up by the poets and painters 
of our day. Dickens wrote his novels part by 
part : he kept his finger on the public pulse to 
see whether they were popular. If the public 
was dissatisfied, he made a change. There is 
a kind of novel that one meets with now and 
then (Mr. Gissing has written one or two) in 
which the first three hundred pages serve chiefly 
as an introduction to the last chapter. These 
pages are often not very interesting in them- 
selves, sometimes they are even rather dull. 
But they are necessary ; they make the effect 
of the last chapter tremendous ; you could n't 
get such an effect without. Of this kind, for 
instance, are apt to be the novels of Guy de 
Maupassant. This may be called an artistic 
form : such an effect is to be produced, and it 
must be produced in a certain way. But it is 
not a conciliatory form of fiction. Imagine 
such a novel coming out, as Dickens's novels 
did, in parts. The first nineteen parts would 
wear out the populace ; they never would get 
to the twentieth, for which all was preparatory. 

Such is rather an exaggerated example of 
the difference of feeling between the novelist of 
to-day and the novelist of fifty or sixty years 
ago. Dickens, like Scott twenty years before 
him, looked on the public from the standpoint 
of an * artificer of their pleasures," considered 
himself as one " catering for public amusement." 
Mr. Gissing would seem to have little regard 
for the pleasures of the public or their amuse- 
ment ; his books are to some tedious, to some 
painful, to others true, to others powerful. But 
Mr. Gissing, to judge from the general tone of 
his work, seems to have been influenced very 
little by public desire : he writes what he calls 
a good novel, and if the public does not like it, 
they can do the other thing. Mr. Gissing 
himself is " devoted to his art." 

With these considerations pro and con as to 
Mr. Gissing's especial qualifications for the 



understanding of Dickens, we come to his book. 
What will he have to say on one who was not 
so long ago " the most popular novelist of the 
century, one of the greatest humorists that 
England has produced " ? As might be imag- 
ined, he speaks chiefly of Dickens's characters. 

The reason for this is that Mr. Gissing is 
mightily interested in people and in the way to 
present them in novels. He is also interested 
in the construction of a story ; but he sees at a 
glance that Dickens's stories are not well con- 
structed. He is interested in social questions ; 
but he sees that Dickens's sociology was too 
conservative to be now illuminating. He is not 
much of a humorist himself, and he does not, 
therefore, have much to say of Dickens's hu- 
mor. He is not a great man for style, and he 
does not, therefore, have much to say of Dick- 
ens's style. These four matters he does deal 
with to some extent, but to them all together he 
gives rather less attention than to the study of 
character, and of Realism, which goes along 
with it. All that he says cannot be here re- 
viewed and estimated : one thing must be 
enough, the great question, indeed, as to 
Dickens, Did he approach Nature in his 
characterization ? Here Mr. Gissing's views 
are interesting. 

Mr. Gissing, whose own methods of charac- 
terization are very different, thinks that Dick- 
ens's figures are not caricatures but idealiza- 
tions ; and this idealization he approves. " In 
this idealized portraiture, we have essential 
truth," says he, speaking of Mr. Micawber, 
or, rather, of the pre-Australian Micawber. 
To one who recollects that this essential truth 
is commonly roseate, this view of the " pessi- 
mistic " Mr. Gissing should be a revelation. 
Dickens sometimes presents unfavorable ideal- 
izations like Mr. Pecksniff ; but commonly 
his idealizations are a compliment to the human 
race, or at least to the masculine half of it, 
from one of the keenest of observers. For 
Dickens was on the better side ; " he embodied 
the better dreams of ordinary men." And this, 
I suppose, was the reason why he needed the 
sympathy of his audience, so that he always 
kept them in mind and so often refined his 
ideas in order to humor them. It is a pleasant 
conception, and, I think, sound. 

Still, I do not think that people are very 
fond of this kind of idealization just at the 
present time. Neither does Mr. Gissing, I 
imagine, though he does not say so. What he 
does say is that " so great a change has come 
over the theory and practise of fiction . . .

that we must treat of Dickens as in many 
respects antiquated." This states boldly what 
many people will never have thought of. Yet 
I do not suppose that Dickens is very much 
read now ; most people have already read his 
novels, generally as children, but they do not 
read them now. ' Mr. Gissing, however, has 
evidently read Dickens thoroughly and often. 
This book shows a familiarity with Dickens's 
works which either indicates severe study or 
pretty constant re-reading. Mr. Gissing doubt- 
less has gained something from Dickens, 
although probably not in the way of technique. 
We cannot really comment on Mr. Gissing's 
criticisms ; it must be enough to indicate the 
general interest of his book. Personally, I 
think it more interesting for the light it throws 
on Mr. Gissing's own books than for that 
which it throws on its especial subject. But 
most people, I suppose, will be more interested 
on account of Dickens. And such will read 
the book with pleasure, and probably have a 
higher opinion of Dickens when they finish 
than they had when they began.

THE SUPREMACY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON.* 

The appendix to M. Edmond Demolins's 
" Anglo-Saxon Superiority " suffices to show 
the extent of the hubbub this sensational work 
created in Paris upon the occasion of its first 
appearance, in April, 1897. Having attained 
a tenth edition in France, it is now translated 
into English by M. Louis Bert. Lavigne. The 
work is a polemic, devoted to the maintenance 
of the thesis that individuality means success in 
temporal affairs, and collectivity failure, when 
viewed as national characteristics. France is 
a nation which teaches its people to be inde- 
pendent in nothing, but rather to look to the 
state for the most desirable because the most 
permanent of careers ; while England ehcour- 
ages its subjects to think and act for themselves, 
and America follows the same course, even to 
turning the management of its affairs over to 
foreigners, so averse is the Anglo-Saxon ele- 
ment in the nation to profiting by governmental 
opportunities. Then, France being a nation 
which is falling behind in the struggle for ex- 
istence, and the English-speaking nations those

which are occupying the earth to the exclusion 
of all others, it is an easy matter to prove that 
socialism is the easy descent to Avernus, and 
individualism a royal road to all manner of 
prosperity. Real prosperity, in the sense of 
high national character and righteousness, are 
not touched upon other than incidentally. 
Throughout the book, the welfare of the body 
is taken as the standard of success. Religious 
differences are rigidly excluded from the dis- 
cussion. It is a matter of sociology and the 
social instinct. 

To those sincere individualists among the 
Anglo-Saxons in England and America who 
really hold with the fundamental proposition 
advanced by M. Demolins, the work reads un- 
commonly like a satire. The French book was 
written and published before the Spanish war 
and the Dreyfus incident, both of them adding 
weight to its contentions, since one makes for 
Anglo-Saxon predominance and the other for 
Gallic decadence. But if it is true that the 
Anglo-Saxon stands higher in the world to-day 
than ever before, is it not also true that the 
principles of socialism have obtained a footing 
in the two great English-speaking nations un- 
known before ? M. Demolins takes no account 
of a host of facts. He estimates the growth of 
socialism in England by the success waiting 
upon the efforts of William Morris and his 
associates. But what of Lord Salisbury's dic- 
tum, " We are all Socialists now " ? which is 
something more than a generalization it is a 
confession. And what of the London County 
Council, and Glasgow, and this city and that, 
with board schools, labor legislation, and the 
like ? And why is the voice of Mr. Herbert 
Spencer raised in a protest against the bland- 
ishments of collectivism? Is it not because 
English contemporaneous history in lawmaking 
reads like a ballade with the refrain, 

" And where are the heroes of laissezfaire ? " 

This being the state of affairs in Britain, 
what of the United States ? From the begin- 
ning of the republic there had been a political 
party devoted to the principles of individualism 
as elementarily needful to the safety of the 
nation. What has become of that party? 
Opposed to it, under one name or another, was 
a combination of opportunists who held out 
more government and more as fundamental to 
permanence in American domestic affairs. So 
successful has this organization been in its 
propaganda of governmental aid, rather than 
self-help, that its tenets have been somewhat 
expanded and adopted by its former adversary.

Instead of a conservative party devoted to the 
Jeffersonian dictum that " that nation governs 
best which governs least," opposed by a liberal 
party which stood for Federal aggrandizement 
at the expense of the States, we have now a 
party devoted to such radical tenets as national 
expansion at the expense of other peoples on 
the globe, as taxation for taxation's sake in the 
matter of the tariff, as a permanent public debt, 
as an increased standing army and all the con- 
comitants of militarism, and pledged to a score 
of mentionable minor matters which would have 
appalled the Fathers of the Constitution ; while 
over against this body of radicals stands an- 
other who seek such a revision of the Federal 
Constitution as can be called nothing short of 
revolutionary, even though it be within the 
limits of the written law that it intends to make 
its efforts felt. The entire tendency of the 
Republican party since the death of Lincoln 
has been socialistic ; the sole purpose of the 
Democratic party since its capture by the Popu- 
lists the " Republicans gone to seed " of Mr. 
Bourke Cockran has been socialistic to a 
point almost ridiculous. And the only indi- 
vidualists left in the land, to all appearances, 
are comprised in a little band of " Jeffersonian 
anarchists," " voices howling in a wilderness," 
pastors without a flock, teachers without pupils, 
politicians without a party, almost patriots 
without a country. What, then, becomes of 
M. Edmond Demolins and his explanation that 
really explained ? We fear that Anglo-Saxons 
are successful in spite of socialism, and French- 
men are not : a reduction of his thesis to an 
absurdity, if ever there was one. 

WALLACE RICE. 



THE NEW SCIENCE OP ETHICS.* 

The study of ethics has been carried on very 
largely by men whose interest was in some 
form of social utility rather than in science ; 
hence, the influence of the modern spirit has 
transformed other humanistic studies before 
being felt in the sphere of distinctly ethical 
problems. The result is that many who are 
interested in carrying scientific methods into 
the study of humanity have been inclined to 
regard ethics as a mere pathological study. 

THK FACTS or Tin MORAL Lire. Bj Wilhelm Wundt, 
ProfeMor of Philosophy in the University of Leipzig. Trans- 
lated by Julia Gulliver and Edward Bradford Titchener. New 
York : The Maomillan Co. 

ETHICAL SYSTEMS. By Wilhelm Wundt. Translated by 
Marcaret Floy Waahbnrn. New York : The Maomillan Co. 



But the great importance of ethical problems 
makes such an attitude necessarily transient. 
Ethics regains something of the central import- 
ance which was given it in the Greek world, 
and various attempts are made to determine its 
sphere and function as a modern science. 

These attempts have been seriously ham- 
pered by the distorted perspective in which 
human problems are seen. The lower biological 
world has been widely and deeply studied, while 
the higher human life has received little scien- 
tific investigation. Thus we are inclined to 
view human problems largely from the stand- 
point of forces and tendencies whose main ex- 
pression is in lower forms of life. Yet the laws 
which are most important in any sphere of life 
are precisely those which are found only in that 
sphere. To attempt the explanation of biolog- 
ical problems by the application of the princi- 
ples of the inorganic world would be no more 
absurd than to try to interpret human life by 
applying the more universal biological laws. 
Carrying over generalizations from one field to 
another, without an independent study of the 
facts in the new sphere, is as remote from the 
true method of science as theological specula- 
tion is from the inductive study of nature. 
Nowhere is this distortion of view more pre- 
valent or more harmful than in ethics. The 
problems in this field are so peculiarly human 
that the first requisite to any understanding of 
them is an independent study of the facts in the 
history of the human spirit. 

Professor Wundt's work is not entirely free 
from this faulty perspective, though there is 
less of it here than in other recent attempts to 
make ethics scientific. The two volumes which 
are here admirably translated survey respect- 
ively the facts of the moral life, and the data 
of ethical reflection as represented in philosoph- 
ical systems of ethics. Such a descriptive sur- 
vey is certainly an indispensable preliminary to 
all theoretical discussion of ethical problems. 
Yet Professor Wundt begins his survey from 
the point of view that ethics is a " normative " 
science, and so entirely differentiated from 
positive sciences that limit themselves to the 
discovery of natural laws. He shows how the 
idea of a norm has passed from ethics over into 
other sciences and has modified them. At the 
same time he regards this transference as gen- 
erally questionable, and holds ethics to be the 
one truly normative science. Yet he realizes 
that ethics has its positive aspects ; and, indeed, 
he approaches its problems now from the one 
and now from the other point of view, without at

THE DIAL 



301 



any time integrating the two. The question 
suggested by this discussion is whether the nor- 
mative idea in ethics is not a mere inheritance 
from the speculative period, a tradition from 
which we find it hard to free ourselves precisely 
because ethics is the last of the sciences to feel 
the modern impetus. Ethics leads immediately 
to the art of living the most important of 
the fine arts ; but it is a question whether the 
pure science of ethics is concerned with a norm 
for conduct in any other sense than the pure 
science of physics is occupied with furnishing 
norms to the mechanical arts, or than the sci- 
ence of botany is concerned with giving laws to 
horticulture. 

The effect of the point of view which Pro- 
fessor Wundt assumes is less important in these 
two volumes than in the third portion of the 
German work in which the statement of his own 
view is given. Yet his fundamental attitude 
cannot fail to modify his account of the data 
of the moral life as well as his discussion of the 
history of ethical theory. On the other hand, 
he has the merit of uniting with severe scien- 
tific training the reflective insight that comes 
from a deep study of the history of philosophy 
and particularly from thorough familiarity with 
Kant. If this may partially account for the 
prejudicing of his point of view, it makes him 
more open to peculiarly human facts and prob- 
lems than is true of most efforts to make ethics 
scientific. Again, it enables him to see over 
the more superficial utilitarian views which 
have accompanied the modern development of 
English ethics. 

The chief value of the anthropological vol- 
ume is in the range of facts cited. There is 
but little effort or ability to focus the facts and 
indicate their significance. The main idea 
which prevails throughout is that of the early 
dependence of moral facts upon religion, and 
their slow differentiation from the latter. The 
wealth of anthropological illustration grows 
rather tiresome from the absence of artistic 
power in its presentation. 

The second volume furnishes a very readable 
review of the progress of ethical philosophy. 
The point of view, differing so substantially 
from that present in English books discussing 
the same material, gives a peculiar freshness 
and suggestiveness to the treatment. As the 
clue to the author's own view is given in the 
first volume through the introductory chapter, 
so in the second volume it is the concluding 
general criticism of ethical systems which has 
greatest interest. 



One closes the book with a very mingled 
feeling : the admiration for its suggestiveuess 
and occasional largeness of view is accompanied 
with regret that the author, having gone so far 
in emancipating himself from the traditional 
view of ethics and in lifting it to the plane of a 
science, should not have gone one step further.

matter for experimentation betrays no feeling in the 
presence of all these quivering nerves. The De- 
stroyer is Love, working upon a group of unbal- 
anced natures, and bringing one life after another 
to shipwreck. A book at once so unpleasant and so 
powerful is not often met with, although The Tor- 
mentor " in a measure prepared us for it. Mr. 
Swift's style is Meredithian in its turn of phrase, 
but less tortuously involved than that of his master. 
One would like to forget his books after reading 
them, but the thing is impossible. 

" Scribes and Pharisees " purports to be " a story 
of literary London," but the description is hardly 
justified. The hero, it is true, after a career in the 
Latin Quarter of Paris, returns home across the 
Channel, and works his way through provincial jour- 
nalism into some sort of repute as a man of letters, 
but the story is really that of the miserable failure 
of his own private life rather than of the typical 
conditions of the literary life, in London or else- 
where. Its text may be taken from the book itself. 
" To the pressman, as to many others, the life of 
the writer of fiction is believed to be an ideal exist- 
ence. In few cases, perhaps it is, but in the 
majority, even the popular novelist, whose name is 
on everyone's lips, and whose doings and sayings 
are chronicled in every newspaper up and down the 
Kingdom, has his skeleton in the cupboard." From 
this sentence it will be seen that Mr. Le Queux has 
no style worth mentioning ; it may also be inferred 
that he has become somewhat embittered by the 
accidents of his calling. There is not much of 
" literary London " in his book, but there is a good 
deal of life in its more clouded aspects, besides an 
infusion of melodrama. 

" By Order of the Magistrate " is the story of a 
girl called Mordemly. She is a product of the Lon- 
don slums, and the mystery of her name is not solved 
until we have given up puzzling over it. When 
we learn that it is merely a corruption of Maud 
Emily we rather resent the intrusion of the conven- 
tional cognomen, so accustomed have we grown to 
the phonetic spelling. As a rule, slum stories are 
depressing, if not flatly unreadable. This one is 
neither the one nor the other, because, in the first 
place, it does not single out sensational incidents 
for treatment, and, in the second, it tells a frank 
tale of the development of wholesome character 
under unfavorable circumstances. Mordemly is so 
vital a figure that she has our sympathetic interest 
from the start, and even her dialect is acceptable, 
since we feel that her story is not told for its sake, 
but that it is merely one of the conditions necessary 
for the delineation of her character. The book is a 
faithful study of a phase of low life ; the author's 
eye is constantly fixed upon his object, and the re- 
sult, while not in any way startling, has the effect 
of a piece of work carefully and faithfully done. 

In writing The Queen's Cup," Mr. 6. A. Henty 
has, for the moment, turned aside from his audience 
of boys to address their elders. He has produced 
an entertaining story of love and adventure in which 



those very qualities of simplicity and directness that 
have made him so successful a writer for the young 
appear to excellent advantage, and make us wish 
that others of our novelists might have the advant- 
age of a similar discipline. Perhaps the t's are 
crossed a trifle more carefully than they need be, 
but straightforwardness and lucidity are of the prime 
virtues of fiction, and we would rather have them 
in exaggerated form than miss them altogether. 

There is little to say of The Lust of Hate " be- 
yond mentioning the fact that our old friend Dr. 
Nikola figures once more, quite as mysterious a vil- 
lain as ever, and that the story begins in Australia, 
ends in South Africa, and has a shipwreck and 
desert island episode by way of interlude. It is 
ingeniously contrived, and quite as melodramatic 
as Mr. Boothby's earlier novels. 

In " The Iron Cross," by Mr. Robert H. Sherard, 
we have a story of considerable originality and suc- 
cess in the narrating. A young Englishman sojourn- 
ing in the Landes, comes upon the track of a kins- 
man who has fought in the Peninsular War, and 
into possession of a much-venerated relic which he 
had stolen from a Spanish church and concealed in 
the village where he had taken refuge and died. 
How the young Englishman falls in love with a fair 
Spanish maiden, how he obtains possession of the 
relic and learns of its value, and how, in restoring 
it to Cartnela, he restores her own happiness at the 
cost of his own all these things are set forth 
most attractively in this distinctly interesting story. 

The Romance of a Midshipman " is welcome to 
lovers of wholesome sea stories, as, indeed, are all 
the many books of Mr. W. Clark Russell. He does 
not seem to write himself out, in spite of his indus- 
try, and somehow finds fresh material, at least in 
part, for every new story. The material is far fetched 
at times, a fact witnessed by the story now before 
us, which, besides the familiar incidents of storm 
and shipwreck, desolate reef and providential rescue, 
provides us with at least two novelties a derelict 
ship with a cargo of wild beasts, and a floating island 
of driftwood in the midst of which is imbedded a 
yacht in prime condition, all supplied with fresh 
provisions. The " Romance " begins in France, on 
the coast betwixt Brest and placid old Calais," 
where the hero was born of English parents, where 
he goes to school, and whence he runs off to sea. 
This boyish part of his life is quite as interesting as 
what comes afterwards, and suggests a comparison 
with the school and the schoolboy of Du Maurier's 
" Martian." The hero is, however, hardly more 
than a boy when we take leave of him, romantically 
and happily married, and having wisely resolved to 
exchange the sailor's life for the landsman's. It is 
hinted by the publishers that Mr. Russell has put 
not a little autobiography into thin interesting book, 
which again suggests the comparison with " The 
Martian," as far as the early chapters are concerned. 

Mr. Owen Rhoscomyl, in " The Lady of Castell 
March," gives the following directions for under- 
standing the historical environment of the period 



1898.]

of which he writes: " Let [the reader] take all that 
he has read about the Highlands under the clan 
system, about the Scottish Borders in the old days 
of the Raiders, and about the Ireland of the Pale. 
To these add something which outdid them all as 
fostering turbulence ; namely, the Welsh ' Lordships 
Marcher ' which for centuries wielded the chief influ- 
ence over the English crown on the one hand and the 
fortunes of Ireland on the other; making always 
for the profit of the strong hand. Shake all these 
together into inextricable confusion and the result 
will give some idea of the Wales of Tudor times." 
There is no doubt about the " inextricable confusion," 
at least, and we must make complaint of this, as of Mr. 
Rhoscomyl's two earlier novels, that the confusion 
has passed over from the history, where it belongs, 
to the work of art based upon these materials, 
where it undoubtedly does not belong. We defy 
the most careful reader to get a clear notion of the 
complicated relationships of this romance, or to fix 
the scenes of its wild fighting and hairbreadth 
escapes in the mental vision. All that can be 
won by the most patient effort is the spectacle 
of a phantasmagoria of turbulence, from which 
shadowy figures emerge from time to time, but which 
is merely bewildering in general effect. The skele- 
ton of the romance is of a familiar sort. There 
is a stout and youthful hero, scorned by the high- 
born maiden whose knight he becomes, yet who per- 
sists in encountering great perils in her service. 
He is, of course, rewarded at last, and her maiden 
pride melts into submission when it is time for the 
story to end. But there is no psychological ground 
for her conduct, and she is even less of a rational 
being than is usual with heroines of her type. 
The story is exciting enough, even if it carries 
Celtic vagueness to an extreme, and its archaism 
of manner is skilfully consistent. 

" To Arms ! " by Mr. Andrew Balfour, is a semi- 
historical romance of the eighteenth century, having 
a young Scotch surgeon for hero, and Edinburgh 
and Paris for chief scenes of action. From the 
borderland farmstead where the boy is reared to the 
Bastille whither his strange adventures lead him 
is a far cry, and the way is filled with surprising 
adventures. John Law is the only historical char- 
acter of whom anything like a full-length portrait 
is attempted. The story is long drawn out, and 
almost wearisome in parts, so garrulous does the 
narrator grow, but the interest quickens every now 
and then, and helps the reader to persevere through 
the nearly six hundred pages. 

" John Burnet of Barns " is a story of romantic 
adventure in Scotland and Holland during the years 
just preceding the English Revolution. There is 
a moderate amount of Scots in the language em- 
ployed, but it is not broad enough to make reading 
difficult, and the narrative flows with even current 
to a satisfactory ending. There is a scholarly flavor 
about this book which sets it upon a higher plane than 
most of its kind. Yet there is also no lack of exciting 
incidents and bloody encounters. The story is told 



in the familiar reminiscent fashion, a harmless affect- 
ation, albeit one that has been employed quite 
enough. 

Mr. Victor Waite's "Cross Trails" is a story 
of adventure pure and simple, being quite inno- 
cent of style and devoid of literary architecture. 
Half of it is in South America, and the other 
half in New Zealand. The hero is a despicable 
creature, but his adventures are exciting enough, 
in all conscience, and they follow thick and fast 
one upon another. The mainspring of the action 
is the hackneyed device of an ancient manuscript 
giving indications of a hidden Spanish treasure, 
but we do not have even the mild satisfaction 
of unearthing the treasure at the end, which is a sad 
disappointment. The author seems to know the two 
countries of which he writes, and this is something 
to his credit. 

" The Adventures of Captain Kettle " are epis- 
odical stories united into a sort of novel by the 
personality of their hero, and by the occasional 
reappearance of a few other people. The doughty 
Captain of these adventures is a carefully studied 
type of the sea hero, most of the time " down on his 
luck " and consequently ready for all sorts of desper- 
ate ventures, bold and resourceful in emergencies, 
and given to writing poetry for a diversion, unscru- 
pulous at sea, and a model husband and chapel-goer 
at home. His adventures are in many parts of the 
world, from Cuba to Japan, and there is no reason 
why the writer should not have many more of them 
to tell, as we sincerely hope he has. 

" Prisoners of Hope " is an engaging title for 
a romance, and awakens a pleasurable anticipation 
in the approach. It does not take long for the 
reader to find his anticipations more than realized, 
for, as the story develops, it rises so far above its 
class as to occupy an almost unique position. We 
have had many romances of colonial Virginia, and 
the chief impression produced by them has been that 
of wonder at their inadequate use of the rich material 
available. It would seem that the example of Thack- 
eray should have established a standard toward 
which at least some approach might be made by 
those following in his footsteps. But " The Virgin- 
ians " has had no successor, until the story now before 
us, that has not seemed pitifully bare and inadequate. 
We have no intention of ranking the present pro- 
duction with " The Virginians," but we do not hesi- 
tate to assert that no previous romance of American 
origin dealing with the subject has equalled it in 
firmness of handling, in literary and constructive art, 
or in romantic interest of the finer sort. The 
" prisoners of hope " are the " redemptioners " of 
the Restoration, that strange commingling of felons 
with high-minded gentlemen sold into temporary 
slavery upon the Plantations. Jail-birds from New- 
gate were shipped to Virginia in company with 
austere and fanatical Cromwellians and victims 
of the Act of Uniformity, and all were subjected 
to the same harsh treatment at the hands of their 
masters. Miss Johnston has taken for her hero

a young soldier of the Commonwealth, condemned 
to servitude for a crime of which he is innocent, 
who becomes the leader in an uprising which has 
for its object the establishment of a new Common- 
wealth in the New World. The revolt is made 
futile through treachery, but the hero is placed 
in a position to perform striking acts of heroism 
for his master, and to win his respect and gratitude 
in the face of fearful adverse presumptions. More 
than this, he wins the love of his master's daughter, 
for he rescues her from deadly peril upon more 
than one occasion, and finally wrests her from Indian 
captivity under circumstances as thrilling as any that 
were imagined by Cooper. The story of the long 
search for the captive girl, and the still longer 
journey with her through the wilderness and back 
to civilization, is one of the most effective things 
of the sort with which we are acquainted, and the 
final tragic separation of the lovers, necessary though 
it be from the artistic standpoint, comes as near 
to being heart-breaking in its pathos as any thing 
that is often met with in romance. It is Cooper over 
again as to adventure, and has, besides, a literary 
grace that was beyond Cooper's reach. The minor 
characters are also admirably portrayed the Vir- 
ginian planter, the court gallant who wooes his daugh- 
ter and turns out a finer gentleman than his affected 
foppishness would seem to indicate, the stern Olive- 
nans and the Muggletonian fanatics all are deline- 
ated with a skill that comes near to being masterly, 
while the figure of Governor Berkeley is for the first 
time made actually to live in a work of fiction 
a feat often attempted, but never, to our recollection, 
before accomplished. Miss Johnston is, as far as we 
know, a new writer, and if this be indeed her first 
book, it is a performance that is remarkable in itself, 
and that promises much for the future of American 
historical fiction. 

" A Romance of Summer Seas," the second work 
of fiction published by Miss Varina Davis, is a dis- 
tinctly interesting and almost strong piece of work. 
The action occurs on a P. and O. steamer, and in 
Hong Kong and Yokohama. The heroine is a slip 
of a girl, the daughter of an Englishman living in 
Fenang, sent on a voyage in search of health under 
the protection of an old friend of the family. She 
is hardly more than a child, and both she and her 
protector are too innocent to imagine that anyone 
will think evil of their innocent relationship. But 
they reckon without the evil tongues of a scandal- 
loving ship's company, and before the voyage is 
many days old, they find themselves objects of sus- 
picion, and very ugly complications follow. Later 
on, there is a duel, and the story ends with the mar- 
riage of the girl and her guardian. So much for 
the story proper, but the book is more than a story. 
It is a delineation of life, made possible by a gen- 
uine gift for characterization and made vivid by 
many deft touches based upon actual experience of 
the scenes and situations described. There is no 
doubt of the individuality of each of the half dozen 
persons chiefly concerned, and the account of their 



relations with one another has both variety and 
animation. 

" Ye Ly tile Salem Maide " is a prettily artificial 
story of the witchcraft terror in Massachusetts. As 
a novel it has little to recommend it, for it is weak 
in both plot and characterization. But it is written 
so charmingly, and has so winsome a childish hero- 
ine, that its reading brings a certain pleasure, aside 
from the instruction afforded. While making no 
pretensions to historical scholarship, it does display 
a close study of Puritan manners and modes of liv- 
ing, and brings before us in a rather impressive way 
the figure of the young Cotton Mather, besides 
giving thumb-nail sketches of Judge Sewall and Sir 
William Phipps. 

Miss Marshall Sannders, in her Acadian story 
entitled " Rose a Charlitte," has chosen a track 
almost unbeaten by the novelist, and given us a 
faithfully-studied and charming picture of the Land 
of Evangeline and its people. She tells of a young 
Bostonian, who goes to Acadia in the hope of right- 
ing a wrong done by one of his forefathers to a 
victim of the expulsion, and who not only accom- 
plishes his purpose, as far as that is humanly possi- 
ble, but finds his own happiness, although long- 
delayed, as well. Rose a Cbarlitte is one of the 
most gracious women who are often met with in 
romance, a creature of ideal purity and charm, un- 
touched by the stain of the modern world, whose 
placid soul, made even more beautiful by the chast- 
ening of adversity, is sharply contrasted with the 
nervous and anaemic types of womanhood who figure 
as the heroines of most of our recent novels. The 
story exhibits but little constructive art, and its 
texture is almost as decoitsu as the speech of the 
simple Acadian folk who people its pages, but it 
pictures a race and a mode of life that are almost 
unknown to us, although so easy of access, and the 
final impression left by it is one of sweetness in the 
sentiment and conscientiousness in the portrayal. 

In naming her latest novel " Good Americans," 
Mrs. Burton Harrison doubtless wished to convey a 
mildly satirical suggestion, since only one of her 
characters can be taken as literally answering to 
that description. The others are of the useless and 
aimless class of those whose lives are a mockery of 
every worthy American ideal, the class that styles 
itself society " in our larger cities, and brings con- 
tempt upon the American character. But Mrs. 
Harrison is of too kindly a nature to be satirical 
otherwise than by suggestion, and it is to be feared 
that the doings of the fashionable world are taken 
by her rather too seriously, in spite of her sympathy 
for what is simple and good in human nature. Her 
book has the grace that comes from long practise in 
entertaining writing, and she moves easily about in 
the world of dining, and yachting, and foreign 
travelling, and pleasure-seeking which she knows so 
intimately. Now this world of petty ambitions and 
empty occupations cannot possibly have other than 
an artificial interest for any earnest person, and, 
consequently, such a novel as this cannot be any-

thing but trivial and superficial. It is the best 
tribute to Mrs. Harrison's skill to say that she does 
her work so well that fair entertainment is made 
out of these unpromising materials. 

"The Californians " is a book that attracts, 
although it is disfigured by cynicism, melodrama, 
and various vulgarities in both thought and expres- 
sion. Mrs. Atherton is not likely ever to acquire 
a refined style, and such phrases as " Helena was 
back " and " His soul grinned " will continue to set 
her readers' teeth on edge, no matter how many more 
books she may write. But she imparts to her narra- 
tive a sense of the exuberant spirit and crude civiliza- 
tion of the Pacific Coast, and her Californians are 
studied from the life. They are not a very agree- 
able lot, and the Spanish-American girl Magdalena 
is the only one that appears to be delineated with real 
insight. Still, such books are documents in the 
history of culture, and have the value of all writing 
that is done with the eye upon the object. 

We might make much the same sort of general 
comment upon " The Money Captain," only we 
should be constrained to add that the writer has a true 
sense of the demands of style, and, if he does not 
frequently achieve ease and grace, is evidently striv- 
ing after these qualities, and may discover their secret 
in time. This is but the second novel of an unques- 
tionably talented writer, and is, we think, an improve- 
ment upon his first, although he has not yet realized 
his artistic consciousness. It is a storyof a very sordid 
kind of life, the life that centres about stockbrokers 
and speculators and fortunes both made and used 
unscrupulously. The " money captain " so merci- 
lessly delineated in these pages is a figure only too 
familiar to our American life in its larger aggrega- 
tions, and readers in New York or Philadelphia will 
find it quite as easy as readers in Chicago ( where the 
scene is laid) find it to fit the description to some 
notorious corrupter of men and manipulator of com- 
mercial forces. Mr. Payne displays in his story the 
instinct of the practised journalist rather than that 
of the writer whose aim is above all else artistic ; 
this fact, taken together with his inherently disagree- 
able theme, prevents " The Money Captain " from 
being a pleasant story to read, in spite of its shrewd- 
ness of observation and skilfully-managed plot. 

The politics of an episcopal election, and the soul- 
stirrings of two young men who discover, after vow- 
ing themselves to the religious life, that the fluid in 
their veins is blood and not water, are the chief 
themes of Mr. Arlo Bates in his latest novel. The 
matter is not very exciting at best, and outsiders 
cannot be expected to take more than a languid inter- 
est in the factional differences to be found within the 
limits of one of the Christian sects, or even in the 
question of clerical celibacy, burning as that question 
becomes to the two young men here concerned. One 
of them breaks from the theological tangle altogether 
and becomes a natural man before it is too late ; 
the other perseveres in his mysticism and carries it 
to the only logical conclusion. Mr. Bates calls this 
book "The Puritans," because he finds in the puritan 



inheritance the secret of the spiritual stress that 
makes his young men take life so very hard, and 
even of the intellectual restlessness that drives his 
other Bostonians to such forms of debauchery as 
spiritualism, and " Christian science," and interest 
in Oriental cults. As a study of certain types of New 
England society, and even of certain undercurrents 
in New England thought, the book is a conscientiously 
put together piece of workmanship, but the breath 
of life is not in it, and the author's ambition has so 
clearly gone beyond his achievement that the final 
word of our criticism must be failure that is, the 
relative failure that does not preclude a considerable 
measure of thoughtful writing and literary skill. 

We shall be much surprised if Mr. Janvier's 
story, " In the Sargasso Sea," does not at once leap 
into boyish favor, and win a place among the books 
of adventure best beloved by the young. It seems 
to us almost as good as "Treasure Island," and 
good in the same way, for both old and young. It 
gives us adventure pure and simple, without admix- 
ture of love or other adventitious sentiment, and 
deals wholly with the strange experiences of the one 
character who tells the story. How he embarks for 
Africa upon a slaver, is thrown overboard because 
he knows too much, is picked up by an English 
steamer, is wrecked in the Sargasso Sea, finds refuge 
among the derelicts that cluster there, works his 
way from hulk to hulk until he finds a Spanish 
treasure-galleon, and then, laden with precious 
stones, makes his way back to civilization, all 
these things, and many more, are related in a way 
at once matter-of-fact and romantic, calculated to 
delight boys of all ages and win a host of devoted 
readers. The Sargasso Sea is almost a new field for 
the imagination of the story-writer, although some 
older readers will remember Mr. Theodore Tilton's 
" Tempest Tossed," published a quarter of a century 
ago, and embodying the same general situation. 

Another story of adventure in which boys will 
delight is called " Four for a Fortune," and tells of 
the discovery of a treasure-hoard upon the French 
island of St. Pierre. There is the usual chart, mys- 
teriously brought to light and deciphered with diffi- 
culty, there are the usual obstacles in the way of the 
search, and there is the usual villain who attempts 
to murder his companions and gain the booty all for 
himself. But we cannot become reconciled to the 
subsequent sinking of the boat that bears away the 
gold so hardly won, and the return of the finders 
empty-handed to New York. 

" The Grenadier " is a story of the Napoleonic 
wars from the Peninsula to Waterloo, and has for 
its hero a soldier of the Old Guard who typifies the 
old-fashioned sort of hero-worship of which the 
Corsican brigand was so long the object. This atti- 
tude toward the Emperor is a good deal belated, 
now that a rich collection of memoirs and other his- 
torical material is accessible to everybody, making 
clear enough to all but the wilfully blind how essen- 
tially despicable was the character of Napoleon and 
how unprincipled were his ambitions. For the rest,

Mr. Farmer's romance is interestingly written, 
although it is overloaded with a large amount of 
strategic military detail that might well be spared 
from a work designed for entertainment. 

The author of The Final War " and " An Amer- 
ican Emperor" has just made a third appearance in 
the field of anticipatory historical fiction with " The 
Lost Provinces," which is a sequel to the second of 
the books above named. France is again plunged 
into war by the provocation of the German Em- 
peror, and the puppet King Henry V. calls upon 
Vansittart for help. This resourceful American 
promptly responds to the appeal, takes command of 
the French armies, and, on the very ground of the 
battles of 1870, reverses the tragedy of Sedan, win- 
ning back for France both her prestige and her 
provinces. At the same time a new Commune arises 
and has to be suppressed, to which task also the ingen- 
ious Vansittart is easily equal. The story makes no 
pretensions to literary form, and is rather disjointed 
in structure, but of its absorbing interest there can 
be no doubt. In its way, it is almost brilliant at times, 
and one or two of its episodes are worthy of the arch- 
magician of historical romance who created Monte 
Cristo and Artagnan.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS.

Anything which naturally calls up 
general discussion is apt to lose a little 
in intrinsic interest. Such is the for- 
tune, with us, of Mr. Louis J. Block's " Capriccios " 
(Putnam). Mr. Block has here chosen dramatic form, 
has written prose dialogues imaginary conversa- 
tions we might call them, although the first is of con- 
siderable length and in several scenes. Now the 
dramatic form is apt to arouse the worst passions 
of some people, and even with ourselves it induces 
a disputatious mood foreign to the enjoyment of high 
poetry. We do not, it is true, think it a crime to use 
dramatic form for matters which can never see the 
stage. We think that Browning did well to write 
monologues, that Landor did well to write conver- 
sations, and that M. Maeterlinck, in writing plays 
that can never succeed on our stage, did as well as 
M. Rostand did in writing a play that can succeed. 
So we do not think that Mr. Block is blameworthy 
in seeking to convey his philosophy and his poetry 
in dramatic form, even though his scenes were never 
meant to be acted. No, we question the form for 
another reason. We have seen different opinions as 
to the meaning of the word " dramatic." We have 
ours, which need not be mentioned here ; in it, as in 
all other such opinions, there is recognition of the 
necessity of characters, actors, persons. Browning, 
in My Last Duchess," must have had an almost 
visual realization of the Duke ; Landor, in present- 
ing Dr. Johnson and Home Tooke, had the antago- 
nists in mind quite as much as the antique philological 



speculations. And M. Maeterlinck conceives his ideas 
in the form of people as obviously as M. Rostand con- 
ceives his people in idealistic form. Now we cannot 
think that Mr. Block does conceive his ideas in per- 
sonal form : we think he has the ideas himself first, 
and then thinks of people who are to have them. 
Take, for instance, the four well-distinguished types 
of thought in " Myriad-Minded Man." There are 
four philosophies, but no philosophers at all. Or take 
Faust between Raphael and Mephistopheles : one 
thinks, perhaps, of "Manfred," but if so, what 
a difference in character. In short, Mr. Block had 
here a fancy, a caprice ; he thought he would try his 
hand at a new form. This is the right of a man who 
has already won the consideration of his readers. 
But we rather regret the experiment, for we think 
that much high thought and feeling has here gone into 
an uncongenial form with an unsatisfactory result, 
which might have delighted us were it more naturally 
and therefore more harmoniously expressed. 

CuHotUiet of Replete with matters of the first liter-

incredible, are the " Passages from the Correspond- 
ence and other Papers of Ruf us W. Griswold," edited, 
annotated, and published by his son, Mr. William M. 
Griswold. From one cover to the other the work 
abounds in the most fascinating revelations of the per- 
sonalities which made up the American world of let- 
ters in the 'forties and 'fifties ; letters, notes, auto- 
biographies, confessions, self-laudations, wails of 
despairing and neglected geniuses now forgotten, 
in brief, all the curiosities of literature which the fore- 
most critical writer of an interesting period might be 
expected to accumulate during his life-time. Not let- 
ters alone but the early journalism is given us in what 
scientists call " preparations " innumerable, notes 
from Greeley and Raymond, and correspondence 
with half the magazine editors in the country, the 
whole forming a collection quite without parallel. 
There is, inevitably, a belated revival of the contro- 
versy over Poe which we hoped had been settled long 
ago. The younger Griswold is not satisfied with 
leaving his father in the right so far as truthfulness 
is concerned, but wishes the literary reputation of 
Poe revised to suit the life he lived without his art. 
Can it not be learned that the worse Poe is made to 
appear as a man the more he entitles himself to our 
charitable sympathy as an artist ? This is the worst 
blot on Mr. Griswold's work in matters of taste. But 
in matters of form the editor has adopted the exas- 
perating plan of commenting on the text of the let- 
ters preliminary to quoting from them, which keeps 
the reader somersaulting throughout the book, habit 
insisting upon connecting the comment with the let- 
ter preceding rather than following. And the dia- 
critical marks imposed upon the unfortunate letter 
o," with other typographical and orthographical 
vagaries, are maddening, nothing less. Mr. Griswold 
forgot, apparently, that the book was to be read by 
others.

Colonial 
expansion 
on English 
models. 



Thoughtful Americans, still halting 
between two opinions as to the great 
question of the hour touching our 
policy in regard to possible future transmarine 
possessions or dependencies, will find much to interest 
them in Mr. Benjamin Kidd's essay on " The Control 
of the Tropics " (Macmillan) . Besides the essay from 
which the little book takes its title, the tenth chapter 
of the author's widely read work on " Social Evolu- 
tion " is given, the whole forming a booklet of one 
hundred pages. Mr. Kidd's argument is somewhat 
elaborate, and justice cannot be done to it in our 
limited space. His main conclusion is that as it is 
the manifest destiny of the tropics to be eventually 
controlled and administered from the temperate 
regions, it is hence the manifest duty of the English- 
speaking peoples to so act now (" with clear purpose 
and with courage ") that this eventual control and 
administration shall conform to English rather than 
continental standards of colonial policy. Tropical 
countries, he argues, should be held in the future as 
a trust for civilization, and not, as they usually have 
been in the past, as estates or " plantations " to be 
worked for the exclusive profit of their custodians. 
England's administration of India and Egypt is 
plainly the model Mr. Kidd would hold up for gen- 
eral imitation. To American minds of the " expan- 
sive " type, Mr. Kidd's pamphlet will probably open 
out an alluring vision of the future paramountcy 
of this country in the tropical regions of Central and 
South America, which are now parcelled out into 
purely nominal " republics," and whose vast resour- 
ces are running to waste in hands incapable of develop- 
ing them. But will protectionist America, in that 
great day, suddenly awaken to the broader advan- 
tages of " the open door " ? 

In 1865, at a Newspaper Press Fund 



had left the reporter's gallery thirty 
years before, he had never " forgotten the fascina- 
tion of the old pursuit." That this should have been 
so was most natural ; in some important respects 
Dickens was essentially a journalist from the begin- 
ning of his life to the end of it. Not because his 
books were generally published periodically, nor 
because he spent much time in editing " Household 
Words " and " All The Year Round," nor because 
throughout his life he had some connection with the 
press. Rather because his literary disposition was 
that of the journalist. He felt the need of being 
close to his public, of keeping in touch with those 
for whom he wrote, of feeling their mood, their 
temper. This was one of the reasons why he liked 
to publish his novels in parts. He could see how they 
went. This was one of the reasons why he was so 
strongly and so fatally drawn to his Readings. This 
is the reason why, in his development of story and 
of character, he so constantly considers how it will 
seem to his readers. Most of Dickens's actual jour- 
nalism was the work of a shorthand reporter, and 
left nothing original as a result. But of his sub- 



sequent journalistic work the recently published 
"Old Lamps for New Ones" (New Amsterdam 
Book Co.), edited by Frederick G. Kitton, gives 
excellent example. It contains about half a hundred 
" essays, reviews, and other papers, here collected for 
the first time." These papers are from many sources, 
the " Examiner " and the " Daily News " and the 
" Morning Chronicle," the magazines that Dickens 
edited himself, and other places. We think it extra- 
ordinary that the editor did not note concerning each 
article the paper or magazine in which it appeared. 
But he did not do so, and the value of the book is 
thus very seriously impaired ; for it comes down to 
the intrinsic value of the productions in question, and 
the fact that they were written by Charles Dickens. 
Intrinsically some of these papers are extremely 
good, some not so valuable. But they are most 
significant as being by Dickens ; they are capital 
examples of Dickens's journalistic temper applied 
to the ordinary topics of journalism. Thus, the 
article which gives title to the collection, written at 
the acme of Dickens's power, holds the Preraphae- 
lites up to ridicule with the same sympathy with 
current feeling on the subject that the most ephem- 
eral penny-a-liner would have had. Not that Dickens 
slavishly followed popular taste (or that journalists 
do either, for that matter) ; he has the same percep- 
tion of popular feeling when he writes of something 
that is not popular, as, for instance, Capital Pun- 
ishment or Ragged Schools. We think that the book 
makes us understand Dickens better. From this 
point of view it is extremely interesting ; but how 
much more interesting it would have been (and use- 
ful to the student) if Mr. Kitton had assumed more 
of the duties of an editor. 

"Democracy < ^ ne nee< ^ ^ a new English edition 
in America" of De Tocqueville's "Democracy in 
in new S etimg. America " has been well supplied by 
the Century Co. Reeve's translation, as revised and 
annotated from the author's last edition, has been 
used, and President Daniel C. Oilman, of Johns 
Hopkins University, is the editor. De Tocqueville's 
speech foretelling the Revolution of 1848, his essay 
on Swiss Democracy, and Dr. Bowen's biographical 
sketch have been retained. There is a portrait of the 
author, a Bibliographical Note, and, we are glad to 
say, a good Index. The helpful Introduction by 
President Oilman lends the requisite element of com- 
pleteness to this well planned edition. Social and 
political conditions in this country have changed in 
some important respects since De Toequeville wrote ; 
but the value of his treatise is in the main unim- 
paired. It is, and will remain, one of the great 
classics of political philosophy, for it is philosophy 
rather than description that De Toequeville gives us. 
Herein he differs from Mr. Bryce, and hereby, 
we venture to say, his work is likely to outlive 
that excellent and as yet indispensable account of 
our existing institutions and current characteristics, 
" The American Commonwealth." De Tocqueville's 
book bears the impress of a mind of a peculiar

cast, of a unique talent, a rare individuality. In 
a word, it is a work of genius. The best that is in 
it is something other and rarer than the fruit of toil 
and scholarship, of close observation and temperate 
judgment, though in the marks of these useful 
qualities, too, it is eminently rich. Another Bryce, 
another Bodley, perhaps another Lecky, we can 
readily imagine coming on occasion to the aid of the 
student of political institutions. A second Montes- 
quieu, a second De Tocqueville, the world is not 
likely to see. Of De Tocqueville's "America" 
Professor Blackie said : " Next to Aristotle's Poli- 
tics, I account this the most valuable political book 
in my library "; and this judgment fairly indicates 
the rank of the book in literature. In reprinting 
it in the form needed by students of to-day, the pub- 
lishers have rendered a public service. No intelli- 
gent American can rise from its perusal without being 
a sounder patriot, a wiser citizen, and a firmer 
believer in the doctrine that government by the 
people for the people, under whatever outward form 
or manifestation, is the government of civilization 
that came in with civilization and will perish only 
with civilization. Dismal speculations now current 
as to the duration of popular government seem futile 
enough. It will endure, under one form or other, 
as long as Western civilization endures. It is not 
possible to seriously imagine a people of high aver- 
age intelligence living permanently under a polity 
which denied them the controlling voice in the 
conduct of their public as well as private affairs. 
Democracy is a phase of human development. 

Readers of THE DIAL are familiar 
w *tk tne critical writings of Mr. 
Hiram M. Stanley, and will wel- 
come the appearance of them in book form under the 
title of " Essays on Literary Art " (Swan Sonnen- 
schein & Co., London). The wide reading, the fine 
discernment, the accurate scholarship with which 
Mr. Stanley has successfully associated his name, 
may here be seen and enjoyed. Especially sugges- 
tive is the concluding paper on " The Secret of Style," 
which adds the weight of literary authority to the 
scientific analysis of Mr. Herbert Spencer, though we 
should have liked to see something specific of Robert 
Louis Stevenson's essay on style. We detect a nod 
of the critic in the " Thoughts on English Love- Song " 
where he says : " It is a long leap from the Eliza- 
bethans to Mrs. Browning, but the interim contains 
no love sonnet of any great merit, with the possi- 
ble exception of Hartley Coleridge's ' To a Lofty 
Beauty ' ". Surely we are, then, to read Jacobeans 
for Elizabethans, or disregard the beauties of Drum- 
mond of Hawthorden ; while Keats's "The day is 
gone, and all its sweets are gone," is but one of several 
which suggest themselves in preference to Hartley 
Coleridge's, which, after all, is chiefly suggestive of 
filial love. Notably neglected is " The Traveller 
and hi* Wife's Ringlet " of (Tennyson ) Turner, 
and the charming u Love's Anniversary " of Habing- 
ton as well, which our critic rates much too low ; 



while all the epithalamia are omitted from consider- 
ation, strangely enough. Nor does the statementthat 
" we look in vain for it [the true lyric love-note] in 
any measure in Robert Browning " seem well con- 
sidered in the face of " Summum Bonum," One 
Pearl, One Girl," and a number of longer songs of 
perfect charm. Still, these are minor matters. 



TheraMxne 
Uritieut. 



The Polychrome Bible (Dodd, Mead 
& Co.) is called to our attention again 
by the appearance of Leviticus, the 
fourth volume issued. This part is edited by Prof. 
S. R. Driver, of Oxford, assisted by the Rev. H. A. 
White. The general features are the same as of those 
volumes already noticed (THE DIAL, Feb. 16, '98). 
The employment of three colors marks the docu- 
ments as follows : (1) The Law of Holiness, occu- 
pying chapters 17-26, is distinguished by yellow ; 
(2 ) the main body of the priestly narrative and laws 
is marked by a white background; and (3) a few 
laws regarded as later than the priestly narrative 
are on a brown background. The analysis is very 
simple, and accords with the views of the school of 
Dr. Driver. The notes contain considerable mate- 
rial of real value. The illustrations are on a par with 
those of the earlier volumes. Scholars and Bible stu- 
dents will greet this part as another scale upon which 
to measure the present status of criticism in Leviticus. 

Another evidence of the research 
which is going to make Americans 
the most thoroughly ancestried people 
in the world appears in the private printing of 
" The Vestry Book and Register of Bristol Parish, 
Virginia, 1720-1789." This interesting manuscript 
has been recently brought to light in the library 
of a gentleman who had kept it immured there for 
a round half-century, and is now given to the world 
in print through the indefatigable labors of Mr. 
Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne (Richmond, Va M 
published by the editor). The book is brimful of 
quaint old facts, some of them of value to anyone, 
historian or novelist, seeking to recreate the atmos- 
phere of a departed and fascinating age. And it is 
also a record of importance to all who set the slightest 
value upon descent, and find the names of their for- 
bears recorded here in respect of the three great 
facts of life birth, marriage, and death.

literature. 



It was preordained that Mr. Saints- 
bury should write a complete history 
of English literature complete, that 
is, in the sense of summarizing the entire course of 
that literature from " Widsith " and Beowulf " 
down to the most recently departed poet Mr. Ruskin 
is the only living writer considered, an exception to 
the general rule that finds some justification. What- 
ever we may think of the eccentricities of the author's 
style or the vagaries of his judgment, he has never 
yet produced an uninteresting book, and his new 
Short History of English Literature " (Macmillan) 
is thoroughly readable from first to last, even the sec- 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

tions that are perforce closely packed with names, 
titles, and other bits of bare fact. And we always feel 
sure that the judgments expressed are Mr. Saints- 
bury's own, for his practice of reading any literature 
whereof he discourses is well known. Indeed, there 
are probably few men living who have read, with criti- 
cal eye, so much modern literature, in the English and 
other languages. This qualification, combined with 
unusual retentiveness of impressions, gives to Mr. 
Saintsbury's writing a solidity beyond that of most 
current criticism, and makes this latest book of his 
peculiarly welcome. The only novelty in its plan is 
provided by the series of ten brief " interchapters " 
that summarize in their more general aspects the 
periods just surveyed. The history is not so very 
" short," either, for it extends to some eight hundred 
pages of about five hundred words each. It takes 
a great deal of industry to prepare such a work, and 
we are not disposed to carp at its minor defects. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor W. J. Alexander has edited the " Select 
Poems of Shelley " for the " Athenaeum Press " series, 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The usual elaborate 
introductory essay is provided, an essay not as entirely 
in sympathy with its subject as we could have wished, 
but still interesting and concise. The longer poems 
included are " Alastor," " Adonai's," " Epipsychidion," 
and " Prometheus Unbound " ; the shorter ones embrace 
most of the best lyrics. The notes are carefully chosen 
and valuable, and the total impression made by the vol- 
ume is one of scholarly neatness and a conscientious 
endeavor to embody the heart of the poet's mystery 
in a series of suitable critical formulae. 

A melancholy interest attaches to the late Professor 
Lane's " Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges " 
(Harper). He had been engaged upon it for nearly 
thirty years, and brought it near completion, only to die 
before he could give it to the public. The task of finish- 
ing the work thus left was entrusted to Professors 
Morgan, Allen, and Smith, but again death intervened, 
and classical scholarship had to mourn the loss of Pro- 
fessor Allen. Then Professor Smith left America to 
take charge of the American School of Classical Studies 
in Rome, and Professor Morgan alone was left. Under 
his direction the work has been carried through the 
press, and is now issued in a volume of nearly six hun- 
dred pages a reference work for advanced scholars 
rather than a college text-book, and a monument to the 
minute and industrious scholarship of George Martin 
Lane. 

" From Chaucer to Arnold," edited by Mr. Andrew 
J. George, is a volume of " types of literary art in prose 
and verse," intended for use as a secondary school text- 
book in English literature. It is essentially a volume of 
texts, as there are more than six hundred pages of them, 
selected with the skill of an experienced teacher and 
critic. The use of such a book gives, at least, some 
sense of the development and continuity of our litera- 
ture, which is more than can be said of the method which 
restricts a year's reading to three or four random clas- 
sics. Mr. George's book is one of the best of its sort, 
and we are glad to commend it to teachers. (Macmillan.) 



I.ITERARY NOTES. 



The beautiful Dent-Scribner edition of Scott has just 
been extended by six volumes, two each of " Kenil worth," 
" The Abbot," and " The Pirate." 

" Evan Harrington " and " Short Stories " are the two 
newest volumes in the revised edition of Mr. George 
Meredith's novels. The Messrs. Scribner are the pub- 
lishers. 

"Maria Felicia," translated from the Bohemian of 
Carolina Svetla, is about to be added to the popular series 
of " Tales from Foreign Lands," published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. 

" Red and Black," just published by Brentano's, is an 
English translation, made by Mr. Charles Tergie, of that 
famous masterpiece of realistic fiction, " Le Rouge et le 
Noir," by Henri Beyle. 

Volume VIII. of " Frederick the Great," completing 
the work, and " Latter-Day Pamphlets " are the latest 
issues in the " Centenary " edition of Carlyle, imported 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The Century Co. have just issued a new illustrated 
edition of that ever-popular story, " The Casting Away 
of Mrs. Leeks and Mrs. Aleshine" (including "The 
Dusantes ") by Mr. Frank R. Stockton. 

"The Autobiography and Correspondence of Mrs. 
Delaney," as revised from Lady Llanover's edition, and 
edited by Miss Sarah Chauncey Woolsey, has just been 
reissued (two volumes bound in one) by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. 

President Schurman's address of last June, upon the 
occasion of the thirtieth annual Commencement of Cor- 
nell University, has just been published in pamphlet form 
by the Messrs. Putnam, and given " A Generation of Cor- 
nell " for a title. 

A second series of " Chap-Book Stories " has just been 
published by Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co., thus adding 
another volume to the several that have already been 
furnished forth by the files of the little magazine that 
won so many friends during its brief career. 

Mr. A. Flanagan, Chicago, publishes an arrangement 
of " Hiawatha," in twelve scenes, for reading-classes and 
school entertainments. The pamphlet is prepared by 
Miss Minnie M. George, and gives full directions con- 
cerning costumes, music, and other adjuncts of such an 
entertainment. 

Mr. Frederick W. Morton, whose compilations entitled 
" Woman in Epigram " and " Man in Epigram " have 
found much favor with a certain class of readers, has now 
prepared " Love in Epigram," a third collection of the 
same general character, published, like the others, by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have just published " A Con- 
cise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities," based 
on Smith's larger work, and edited by Vice-Provost 
F. Warre Cornish, of Eton College. There are over eight 
hundred pages and more than a thousand illustrations, 
all of which are provided at a moderate price. 

The charming reprint of " The Spectator," edited by 
Mr. G. Gregory Smith and published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons, to which we have referred from time 
to time, is now completed by the publication of the eighth 
volume, which has indexes to the entire work. A more 
presentable set of books has not often been devised. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons announce that they 
have purchased the publications of the Christian Liter- 



310 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



atnre Co. These include editions of the Ante-Nioene 
Christian Fathers, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 
the works of St. Augustine and St. Chrysostom, the 
"American Church History Series," and the "Ten 
Epochs of Church History." 

Messrs. Bell & Co., publishers of the " Bohn Library," 
have acquired the copy right of Burton's famous "Personal 
Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah," 
and have issued the work in a new two-volume edition, 
with an introduction by Mr. Stanley Laoe-Poole. There 
are many illustrations, and the edition is in every way 
an acceptable one. It is published in this country by 
the Macmillan Co. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons import for the Ameri- 
can market a new edition (the third) of " The Life of 
Michelangelo Buonarroti," by the late John Addington 
Symonds. Published as they are at a moderate price, 
the two volumes of this edition are brought within the 
reach of a new circle of purchasers, who will, we doubt 
not, heartily welcome the opportunity now offered to 
place them upon the shelf. 

As the end of the century comes nearer and nearer, 
we may expect a great production of works, singly and 
in series, which undertake to sum up the progress of the 
hundred years, or present a conspectus of human knowl- 
edge at the time when we pass into the twentieth century. 
Such books are not strictly due until 1901, but eagerness 
to be early in the field will anticipate that date in many 
cases, and announcements are already beginning to 
appear. An essentially geographical series, entitled 
"A View of the World in 1900," edited by Professor 
J. H. Mat-kinder, is already well under way in England, 
and will include twelve volumes, such, for example, 
as "Britain and the North Atlantic," by the editor; 
" Scandinavia and the Arctic Ocean," by Sir Clements 
Markham ; " France and the Mediterranean," by M. Elis^e 
Rlclus ; " Africa," by Dr. J. Scott Keltie ; and " The Rus- 
sian Empire," by Prince Kropotkin.

By PEARY. 

The most important Book of 1898. A complete authentic record of Lieutenant Peary' & 

Arctic work. H 'is first and only book. 

Lieutenant Peary's narrative abounds in infinite variety, dealing with land and sea, and including descrip- 
tions of the ARCTIC OASIS AND THE ARCTIC HIGHLANDERS, the latter being the most northerly beings 
in their habitat. The discovery and successful transportation here of THE GREATEST KNOWN METEORITE, 
weighing ninety tons, is another feature of great interest. 

14 Northward " is in two volumes of about 600 pages each, and contains over 800 half-tone engravings made from 
Peary's wonderful photographs, together with valuable maps, diagrams, etc., which make it a necessary addition to 
any course of general reading in connection with the study of geography, ethnology, or natural history. 

Northward " Appeals to the Young as well as to the old, and should be as great a favorite with 
the boys as Dr. Kane's delightful work has been for years.

SHIPS AND 5AILORS. 

By Rurus F. ZOGBAUM and JAMES BARNES. 

A beautiful and artistic work and very timely. 

The text consists of the words and music of the most 
famous sea songs in the English language, and Mr. 
Barnes, the author of " Naval Actions of 1812," has 
written also some original songs, with music by Roger 
Coverley, the composer. 

Popular favorites like " The Lass that Loved a Sailor," 
" The Midshipmite," etc., are included in the collection. 
The size of the page is so large that the music can 
readily be read at the piano. With preface and explan- 
atory notes by Mr. Barnes. 

The illustrations consist of 12 beautiful facsimiles of 
water-colors (size 11 J x!4J) and 26 black-and- whites 
by Mr. Zogbaum. 

The pictures are all of the highest order, and some 
of the scenes on the modern war-ships, as portrayed by 
Mr. Zogbaum, are by far the finest of the kind ever 
published. Send for illustrated circular.

rA NEW BOOK BY SYDNEY GEORGE FISHER 

The True Benjamin Franklin 

THE author has been able, by dint of long and patient labor, to make what is certainly one 
of the most complete, authoritative, and entertaining personal histories in existence. This 
work challenges attention for the really valuable light which it throws upon the character of 
Benjamin Franklin. The picture which Mr. Fisher here draws of him is careful, lifelike, and 
impressive in the extreme. While his exhaustive researches have resulted in humanizing 
Franklin, and " making him a man rather than a historical figure," a fair and intelligent 
reader, we submit, will arise from the chapters of Mr. Fisher's work with a larger conception 
of Franklin's character, endowments, and equipment. . . . The work embodies a surprising 
measure of fresh information on a most important as well as interesting subject. 

The True Benjamin Franklin. (Uniform with Ford's The True George Washington.")

" The Making of Pennsylvania," etc. With numerous illustrations, portraits, and facsimiles.

are made to reenact their Colonial parts, and the resulting drama is full of action, humor, wit, 
and pathos." Boston Globe.

SCRIBNER'S NEWEST BOOKS 



RED ROCK A Chronicle of Reconstruction 

By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. With Illustrations by B. WEST CLINEDINST. 12mo, $1.50. 
)\A R. PAGE'S new novel is a romantic love-story of the South just after the war a time when romance and pathos 
* ^ * combined in many picturesque developments, as Mr. Page's former writings have amply attested. " Red Rock " has 
much of the same note which made " Marse Chan " famous. 

" The interest never flags ; from the first page to the last the reader finds his attention absorbed. Mr. Page has written 
one of the strongest novels of the year ; he has proved that he is equally a master of fiction in the form of the novel as he 
unquestionably is of the short story. In plot and construction, in sustained interest, and in the dramatic unity of his tale 
he has displayed the consummate skill of an artist and of a master of technique. It is one of the most fascinating novels 
that have appeared in a long time." Brooklyn Eagle.

COURBIN. Royal 8vo, $15.00. 

ft I T is a chronicle of clothes, of course ; but it is very 
* much more than that ; it is a sketch of the social his- 
tory of Paris from the date of ' the whiff of grape-shot ' to 
that of the momentous first appearance in the Bois of femi- 
nine 'knickers' astride the wheel." London Chronicle. 



THE LOST WORD. By HENRY VAN DYKE 

A Christmas Legend of Long Ago. With illustrations by CORWIN KNAPP LINSON, in photogravure, and with decorative 
borders, illuminated title, and a striking cover design. Uniform with " The First Christmas Tree." 8vo, $1.50. 

P\R. VAN DYKE is particularly happy in his Christmas stories; nowhere else do the poetry, the deep religions feeling

WILD ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN 

By ERNEST SETON THOMPSON. With 200 illustrations from drawings by the author. Square 12mo, $2.00. 
C ACH one of the wild animals whose story is told by Mr. Thompson in this unusual book has been either a close acquaint- 
*-^ ance or so thoroughly studied that his characteristics appear markedly personal. Mr. Thompson's unconventional 
pictures strikingly reinforce the text and add to the attractiveness of a handsomely made and beautifully printed volume. 
"It is a collection of true stories, and in consequence is intensely interesting. . . . The whole volume is profusely 
illustrated, and altogether the book is one that ought to be in every library and home." Evening Telegram.

THE ELEMENTS OF SOCIOLOGY 

By FRANKLIN H. Q1DDINQS,

" The Elements of Sociology " is a text-book for use in high schools and colleges which are unable 
to devote as much time to sociology as is demanded by " The Theory of Socialization " and " The Prin- 
ciples of Sociology." " The Elements of Sociology" is arranged in accordance with the analysis presented 
in " The Theory of Socialization," and contains abundant descriptive and illustrative matter. In this 
book the elements of the subject are presented in the simplest and most straightforward manner, and 
brought within the comprehension of all students who are capable of pursuing any studies dealing with 
such subjects as Economics, Government, Morals, and Legislation. It directs attention to the chief prac- 
tical problems of morals and expediency that are arising from the growth of population and the compli- 
cations of modern social life.

Crown 8vo. Cloth. Price, $1.5O net. 
At the time u The Crowd " was published there was a 
great deal of discussion concerning the theories therein 
advanced. The present volume can hardly fail to awaken 
even greater discussion, for the author has entered upon a 
wider field, and states his conclusions in such a way as to 
leave no room for doubt concerning his meaning. The 
author has already won for himself a high place, but we 
are confident that he will now reach a larger public, and 
arouse new interest among those who make a specialty of 
psychology and sociology.

THE DRAMA AS ART. 

Every now and then, the consciousness of that 
section of the public which is provided with such 
uncomfortable things as ideals becomes stirred 
to the pitch of indignation in contemplation of 
the degradation to which some form of artistic 
endeavor is subjected by the hard conditions 
that a commercial age ever seeks to impose, and 
usually succeeds in imposing, upon the produc- 
tion of the art in question. At one time it is 
literature, at another music, at still another 
painting that comes up for discussion ; just now, 
thanks to the stimulus of a lecture by Mr. Israel 
Zangwill, it is dramatic art upon which the 
fierce light of criticism beats. That the art of 
the playwright will be bettered by this light 
or, to vary the metaphor, by the destructive dis- 
tillation of the accompanying heat is more 
than doubtful ; but it is well that some one 
should from time to time call public attention 
sharply to the low estate into which the stage 
has fallen, for if the ideal find no spokesman 
when hardest pressed, its condition is indeed 
hopeless. Mr. Zangwill, who has just thrown 
himself bravely into the breach, deserves warm 
gratitude for what he has been saying, and we 
trust will keep on saying, for the substance of 
his contention is of demonstrable nature, and 
the eternal years of God belong to the truths 
that are being given so pointed an expression. 

Like all speakers of the unvarnished truth, 
Mr. Zangwill finds that his message is anything 
but acceptable in many quarters. To say noth- 
ing of the wounded susceptibilities of dramatic 
managers, and of the men who fabricate the kind 
of play that the managers want, the journeymen 
who write " dramatic criticism " for the news- 
paper press are quite comically outraged by his 
outspoken remarks. Many of them have been 
saying much the same thing, in a more guarded 
way, all along ; but they profess themselves out- 
raged by the antics of this bull in the china- shop 
of modern vaudeville, and cheap farce, and 
tawdry melodrama. They would roar you as 
gently as any sucking-dove, but they would not 
for the world speak the plain truth in plain 
words ; and as for the scintillating words and 
keen thrusts that flash from Mr. Zangwill's 
armory, they are wholly incapable of forging 



384 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



and wielding the needed weapons. Indeed, the 
lot of these gentlemen who write about the 
nightly happenings of the stage is no pleasant 
one. They have to deaden whatever artistic con- 
science they may possess, to invent euphemistic 
phrases for the characterization of bad plays, 
to pretend that the contemporary English stage 
is interesting when they know in their heart 
of hearts that it is not, and, above all, to simu- 
late a virtuous and fiery indignation when some 
dramatist of genius traverses the petty conven- 
tions of an artificial seemliness and probes human 
life to its depths. The treatment accorded to Dr. 
Ibsen daring the past ten years by nearly all 
newspaper critics stands in everlasting and 
shameful evidence of their shallow incompetence 
as a tribe. 

We are glad, then, that Mr. Zangwill has 
stirred the waters in which these criticasters 
disport themselves, and has called widespread 
public attention to a few home truths concern- 
ing plays and playgoers. He has said nothing 
new about the subject there is nothing new 
to say but he has placed a pretty wit at the 
service of a few of the old ideas, and some of his 
observations are pointed enough to pierce the 
utmost thickness of the Philistine hide. There 
is penetrative energy in such phrases as the 
following : " The modern receipt for a success- 
ful play is a paying compound of snivel, drivel, 
and devil." "The old actors are dead and 
buried, but the plays are dead and printed. You 
can buy them at the price of eggs, twenty-five 
cents a dozen, and they are mostly bad." " The 
critic no more represents the simple and occa- 
sional playgoer than a congressman represents 
the baby he kisses." The taste of these sayings 
is dubious, but an exhibition of bad taste is no 
new thing to Mr. Zangwill's readers. Free 
from this reproach are such acute sayings as 
these : " Irving's respect for Tennyson is unique 
in the history of the stage and of Irving.'.' 
44 Ibsen's ink often runs in the veins of his char- 
acters." 4( The French stage has never lost its 
literary tradition. We have legitimatized its 
children, we have turned its intrigues into flir- 
tations ; but such virtue has its own reward." 
The lecture from which these excerpts are made 
is a sort of Gatling gun of epigrams, and its 
deadly fire is sustained for more than an hour 
with but brief pretermissions. 

The essential contention of this censor of a 
degraded art is that our playmongers are apt 
to forget that it is a form of art with which 
they are concerned. When we think what the 
drama has been as a factor in civilization, when 



we recall the noble uses to which the stage has 
been put in other times and lauds, when we 
reflect upon the possibilities, for instruction 
and edification, of the play which is conceived 
as something finer than a means of amusement, 
we cannot but view with contempt the English 
play which we get from the theatrical syndicate 
and the " bad shopkeepers " of Mr. Zangwill's 
invective. And when we realize that the drama 
is still treated as a fine art in France and Ger- 
many, in Spain and Italy, in Russia and Scan- 
dinavia, while in the English-speaking countries 
alone it has fallen to a level which makes mean- 
ingless any mention of art in its discussion, we 
may well bow our heads with shame. This is 
a general truth of which there is no effective 
denying, for the occasional manager of high 
ideals and the occasional play of literary qual- 
ity serve only to emphasize the pass to which 
the majority of plays and managers have come. 
It is no more than the simple truth to say that 
our audiences do not want ideas in their plays ; 
they want costumes, and tricks of stage-car- 
pentry, and farcical situations ; they are hugely 
delighted by a catchy song or an utterly irrel- 
evant dance ; they will tolerate sentiment if not 
too delicate, and even passion if its origin be 
not too deep within the soul ; but ideas they 
will not have on any terms. 

Is our popular artistic standard lower in 
matters pertaining to the stage than it is in 
matters that concern the other forms of art 
endeavor ? Mr. Zangwill thinks that it is ; but 
we are not so sure. It is popular taste in 44 lit- 
erature that makes possible the existence of the 
class of newspapers that so disgrace American 
civilization. Surely the stage, at its basest, 
can do no worse than that. If we seem to set 
up a higher standard for books than we do for 
plays, it must be remembered that the bad play 
forces itself more obtrusively upon public atten- 
tion than the bad book. People view the for- 
mer in public, as it were, and it is discussed in 
the public press ; whereas the latter is read in 
private, and the critic usually ignores it alto- 
gether. Beneath the lowest stratum of books 
that are thought deserving of mention by news- 
paper reviewers, there is a still lower stratum 
that makes up the chief reading of countless 
thousands of people, as far as they read books 
at all. But the theatres that provide the corre- 
sponding forms of cheap sentiment and vulgar- 
ity are conspicuous in the public eye, and have 
their place in the daily or weekly theatrical 
summaries. We doubt, then, very much if the 
taste of the real public be any better in its read-

ing than in its acting. When we consider music, 
painting, and sculpture, much the same prin- 
ciples hold true. As in literature, so in the case 
of these arts, we can never learn what the masses 
really like, because we cannot readily catch 
them (as we can at a theatre) in the act of what 
stands to them for aesthetic contemplation. But 
from the popularity of certain forms of music, 
and of certain forms of the graphic arts, 
forms in which imbecility and vulgarity seek to 
outrival each other we may at least shrewdly 
surmise that the taste of the dear public is here, 
as with books and plays, in almost equally evil 
case. 

Yet when all is said, one important consider- 
ation remains. In literature, the finest forms 
of art are accessible to everybody. This state- 
ment is also measurably true of music, and 
painting, and sculpture. One can to a con- 
siderable extent come to understand the ideals 
of these arts by the study of photographs and 
scores. At all events, the large cities afford 
actual examples of the highest achievements 
of these arts. But even the large cities rarely, 
if ever, afford to the spectator examples of what 
the art dramatic at its highest can do. They 
may show us marvellous stage- effects, but they 
do not show us sincerity of purpose and unity 
of artistic endeavor. In this respect, it is true 
that in England and America the drama stands 
upon a lower level than the other arts. We can 
all read the greatest literature at home ; we can 
often hear the greatest music perfectly per- 
formed ; we can view some of the greatest works 
of painting and sculpture in the originals and 
all of them in trustworthy reproduction ; but 
we cannot witness such productions of the great 
plays as are to be witnessed in the theatres of the 
European Continent. Our productions may 
cost a great deal more, and be more dazzling 
to most of the senses, but they do not make art 
their foremost consideration, and they justify 
the reproach that in our time has fallen upon the 
English-speaking stage. 



FREEING A DIRECTION. 

This phrase is Bacon's definition of his own 
philosophy. The direction he so successfully freed 
was, of course, towards the promised land of the 
practical and industrial arts, and away from the 
regions of myth and metaphysic. It has become 
more than a direction, it has become a current, 
irresistible and perhaps irreversible. Especially in 
America, where the genius of Franklin has stamped 



practicality on our national character, have we gone 
the whole Baconian way. Recent events are like 
to confirm us in the reasonableness of our ideals and 
methods. A South American traveller reports 
asking the Padre of a Jesuist Mission what it was 
he taught the Indians whom he caught young and 
innoculated with Spanish civilization. " Why," he 
said, " we teach them poetry and theology." Does 
not the difference between the Latin races and ours 
speak in that statement? But let us not be too 
proud. Poetry and theology are no bad aids to 
happiness in this life and security in the next. The 
charm of life is something ; the two immortalities 
of art and the soul are more. There have been 
civilizations which have risen and spread and dom- 
inated the world, and then vanished and left nothing 
behind in the mind of man but a nightmare and a 
headache. Despite our material prosperity, I be- 
lieve there would be a gain in the higher and intenser 
joys of living were some philosopher to look about 
him and free us a direction leading away from the 
long-travelled Baconian road. We have ceased to 
live in the imagination. Literature is degraded to 
about the position of the lapdog of an idle woman. 
Restore us our faiths and our fancies, O philosopher, 
and you may take away some of our comforts and 
conveniences. Perhaps the witch's broomstick was 
a better vehicle than the bicycle. 

But is it possible to establish a new direction ? Are 
we not in the iron grip of a movement which must go 
on until every atom of imagination, every spark of 
superiority, is extinguished? The theories of spon- 
taneous generation and development have disposed 
of First Causes and Efficient Causes, and the rest. 
Man is only a part of the machine of the world, and 
can no longer, as of old, front the huge beast and 
sport with him and turn him about. We are no longer 
images of Our Maker, but a conglomeration of cells 
and unconscious cerebration. We have lost initiative. 
We can no longer originate or control. Bacon 
expressly claimed for his philosophy that it did 
away with the necessity for superior talents that 
it tended to make all men equal. And genius itself 
is accepting this view to-day. Tolstoi in his " War 
and Peace " has a long polemic against the delusions 
of superiority and direction. Great warriors and 
generals, he explains, have nothing to do with gam- 
ing battles : " the man behind the gun " does it all. 
An event like the French Revolution, he says, surges 
up from below, to label it with the names of Vol- 
taire, Rousseau, and Diderot, is absurd. He does 
not go so far as to claim that without Christ 
Christianity could have existed, or Mohammedism 
without Mohammed, or that the radiant area of 
peopled creation which we know as the Shake- 
spearean world could have come into being want- 
ing Shakespeare, but the deductions are evident. 
Positively, it is a relief to turn from the worship of 
unguided force from the view of man as a product 
of climates, foods, inherited nerve-suggestion, and 
what not, to Nietszche's conception of the Over 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Man, who at least stand* on his own legs and plays 
docks and drakes with the universe. 

Waiting the philosopher to arise who is capable 
of changing oar coarse, I would offer a few sugges- 
tions which are particularly for the interests of lit- 
erature. It is wrong to suppose that literature in 
its normal state deals with or imitates all of life with 
equal pleasure. There are vast regions of human 
experience and exertion upon which it looks coldly. 
The scientific activities of man the accumulations 
of minute facts and the uses to which they are turned 
are indifferent if not repugnant to it Keats was 
perfectly right in drinking to the confusion of New- 
ton, who destroyed the rainbow. The vast daily 
commonplaces of life have hardly more place in real 
literature. They are not beautiful enough, or signifi- 
cant enough, or profound enough, for lasting record. 
Yet it is precisely in these fields that the tendency 
of modern thought has driven literature to reap its 
harvests. 

It is worth while to analyze a little the ordinary 
and the commonplace, to see why they fail to afford 
materials for great art. A human being is a human 
being, and per se one ought to be as interesting as 
another. But they are not. Circumstances alter 
cases. Pere Goriot suffers perhaps as intensely as 
King Lear, but he does not affect us as much or as 
permanently. In the first place, Balzac could not 
deal with him beautifully. To put into his month 
the magnificent language of King Lear would have 
been inappropriate even had it been at Balzac's 
command, and cloth of gold is more valuable 
than homespun. In the second place, to have given 
Pere Goriot the far-reaching and elemental thought 
of King Lear would have been equally absurd. The 
conditions of his life could not allow or evoke it. Yet 
great thought is a necessary requisite of great art. 
And, lastly, Pere Goriot is simply an unfortunate old 
man, like any other ; whereas King Lear is the sym- 
bol of old age itself, the old age not only of humanity 
but of nature. 

There is a tendency among recent writers to use 
scientific facts and appliances as materials for liter- 
ature. A certain hardness and hollowness in the 
results is discouraging. It is curious how little we 
really care for such things. A lucifer match or 
a telephone instrument is an article of comfort and 
convenience. We use the one or the other without 
emotion or gratitude. The slightest fact of experi- 
ence which touches our souls the sight of a sunset, 
the scent of a flower, the sound of a woman's voice 
is worth a thousand times more for delight and for 
literature than all the scientific facts and generali- 
zations in existence. The sciences are the helots 
of civilization the hewers of wood and drawers 
of water. We accept their services, but dismiss them 
from our company when we are bent on intellectual 
or social enjoyment They have always resented this 
exclusion, and of late, by dint of decrying the nobler 
and more delicate susceptibilities of human nature, 
they have crushed their way into recognition. But 



the moment man recovers the knowledge of himself 
as a being whose best prerogatives are to think and 
feel, the doom of their equality is sealed. 

If literature can get little aid from science or the 
commonplace, it may be urged that history can sup- 
ply all the materials it needs, and of the noblest and 
costliest kind. History is the school-girl's idea of 
serious literature. She would be shocked if told 
that she must go to poems and plays for profundity. 
But Aristotle said that history was less philosophical 
than poetry. Diderot said that history was a bad 
novel. Arnold said that history presented foam-bells 
of truth on a Mississippi of falsehood. History, 
in fact, lacks the metaphysic basis of great art. It 
relates men only to each other, seldom to their 
families, and never to Nature or God. It is always 
the same kaleidoscope, with the same bits of colored 
glass, in the same hard brilliancy and unmeaning 
complication. A great writer, a Shakespeare or 
a Scott, may humanize characters out of history, but 
as a rule they are only half successes, inferior to 
figures the same writers caught from common legend 
or projected from their own souls. Wagner hesitated 
in choosing for the trial of his greatest powers 
between the historical Barbarossa and the legend- 
ary Siegfried, and he finally rejected the first 
because he felt that the history had not the truth or 
significance of the myth. 

It is, indeed, in the direction of the myth that we 
must turn for the first hope of great literature. The 
myth-making instinct is its life-blood. To allegorize 
the facts of nature or humanity, to fasten upon and 
exalt certain elemental traits and types, is the primal 
instinct The conscience, the aspirations, the very 
essence of races, speak in their myths. Yet myths 
are always an individual product. People never 
assembled in convention to make one, as we do to 
nominate a President. Some sensitive poet soul first 
embodied in words an appearance of nature or 
a human experience. Another added to this, another 
interpreted it, another satirized it, until it became 
a possession of the tribe and the world. In this view 
the process is always going on. The great figures 
of history, as they are accepted by mankind, are in 
the main myths. The mere trivial truths of biogra- 
phy are overridden by the sum of impression. Here 
in America we are unfortunate in not having a back- 
ground deep enough for these ghosts and guides of life 
to gather in any number, yet we have done what 
we could. I cannot recall any other instance of 
a superior race accepting the legends of an inferior 
and savage one, and making literature out of them. 
Yet this is what Longfellow effected with Indian 
mythology in Hiawatha, and Cooper with Indian 
legends in the Pathfinder romances. Hawthorne waa 
driven to import into Puritan life old-world ideas, 
most assuredly foreign to such an environment, 
the search for the elixir of youth, for instance, the 
phantasies of ancestral curses, of a reincarnated faun, 
and many others. Poe's poetry and romance* belong 
to the region of abstraction, metaphysics, rather than 



1898.]

of myth. All these writers were conscious in their 
efforts after what must have seemed to their contem- 
poraries unreality. In the critical jargon of to-day, 
they were not sincere. Yet they achieved great 
successes the greatest our literature has known. 
There is no reason why their successors should not 
follow in their footsteps. Imagination lies dormant 
in the mind of man, and only needs a touch to 
evoke it. 

Myths are the metaphysics of the ignorant. But 
metaphysics themselves the imaginations and logi- 
cal deductions of abstract thought are and always 
must be the mental pabulum of the educated. There 
lies the theatre of the world's greatest poetry. It is 
folly to say that the problems of thought have all been 
threshed out that " fate, foreknowledge, free-will 
absolute," the finite and infinite, birth and decay, 
good and evil have all been so thoroughly debated 
that there is nothing more to say about them, or that 
Mr. Herbert Spencer's Pyrrhonistic dialectic has 
put them forever out of court. They are no more 
exhausted than the eternal 

"Amandus he" 
"Amanda she' 1 

which is the staple of fiction. Man must investigate 
the dark foundations of his estate. The main ten- 
dency of modern literature is akin to the impression- 
istic fallacy in painting, which strives to solve the 
problems of light, and forgets that nearly all signifi- 
cance comes through shadow. To go into a gallery 
of impressionistic pictures is like entering a spring 
opening of a millinery establishment. Everything 
is so gay, riant, and trivial. Put a Rembrandt or 
a Corot or a Millet among such pictures, and the 
grave deep note makes the triviality still more appar- 
ent. In the same way, bring the figures of an Elizabe- 
than tragedy into a crowd of characters from modern 
novels, and the latter will seem like chattering 
monkeys in a cage. 

Patriotism and Religion are matters of too mighty 
import to be made the tails of a literary kite. They 
are, indeed, too dominating and absorbing in their 
nature to have any direct or immediate effect on 
literature. They work for it, as they spiritualize 
man break up his selfishness and sordidness, and 
give play to the exalted enthusiasms of the soul. 
A wave of patriotism seems spreading over the world, 
and perhaps the opening century will see a reawaken- 
ing of the religious instinct. 

I have said enough to indicate the direction I 
believe literature should take. Of course, art of any 
kind can never give up its imitation of life, its repro- 
duction of reality. Myths and abstractions must be 
embodied in human form, must be translated into 
terms of human experience, before they can interest 
humanity. The dark monotony of thought must be 
infused with emotion, colored with imagery. But, 
for my part, I cannot conceive of anything more use- 
less than a literature which reproduces life without 
a background of thought and imagination.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

AS TO "HAD BETTER." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The reading of Professor Edward A. Allen's commu- 
nication in THE DIAL for November 1 might prompt the 
query, How far is grammatical construction to be sacri- 
ficed to a popular idiom ? It strikes one who reveres, 
without feeling himself worthy to be classed among the 
" purists," that while there are combinations preferable 
to " would better " the idiomatic " had better " is not 
among them. Let us make a few experiments with 
Professor Allen's first quoted sentence as a basis. By 
changing the auxiliary we have : 1. " You can better see 
about it yourself." 2. " You might better see about it 
yourself." 3. " You had better see about it yourself." 
Now suppose we remove the adverb " better " (which 
threatens to befog the view of everybody but the " pur- 
ists ") to a place almost equally advantageous for it, near 
the end of the sentence, and note the result: 1. "You 
can see about it better yourself." 2. "You might see 
about it better yourself." 3. " You had see about it bet- 
ter yourself." Which of these three is it that "defies 
all logical analysis " ? If the last one is anything but 
" insipid English," if it is not nearer an " idiotism " than 
an idiom, if nobody except a " purist " would dream of 
objecting to it, then may Heaven and the colleges send 
us more " purists " before our language becomes entirely 
corrupted! FRANK M. BICKNELL.

THE WHITE MAN AND THE TROPICS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your brief notice of Mr. Benjamin Kidd's remarkable 
little book on " The Control of the Tropics " (THE DIAL, 
Nov. 1) accurately states that somewhat dogmatic writ- 
er's main conclusion, but fails to point out a serious flaw 
in his argument. I allude to the sweeping assumption 
that the white races cannot permanently and successfully 
colonize the tropics. Mr. Kidd, soaring on the wings 
of theory, picturesquely says : " In the tropics the white 
man lives and works only as a diver lives and works under 
water" ! It is pretty evident that Mr. Kidd has never 
been south of the Tropic of Cancer. To his imagination 
(fed, one might suppose, by the reports of Sir John 
Maude ville) a tropical country apparently presents itself 
as an Inferno, the native races of which are a sort of 
human salamanders born to an environment in which the 
white man is either bound to be promptly grilled to death, 
or else to gradually perish, qua white man, through a pro- 
cess of mental and physical enfeeblement. The fact is, 
Mr. Kidd is so bent on working out his imperialistic thesis 
that he exaggerates, on the one hand, the climatic dan- 
gers and discomforts that beset the white settler in the 
tropics, and underrates, on the other hand, the degree to 
which those dangers and discomforts can be counteracted 
by modern hygienic science. Were tropical heat the real 
enemy, the case of the colonist might be considered hope- 
less. But the real enemy is the microbe. It has been 
pretty conclusively shown, as is stated in " The Brit- 
ish Medical Journal," that "disease, deterioration, and 
deaths in the tropics are due not so much to the influ- 
ence of climate as to pathogenic germs, which have their 
limited and peculiar geographical areas, and differ greatly 
in the various tropical regions." The inference is plain. 
As a matter of fact, owing to scientific sanitation, the 
death-rate of English troops in India, which used to be 
about 125 per thousand, is now as low as 12 per thou-

sand ; while in Trinidad and Barbadoes the sickness and 
mortality among the soldiers are actually less than at 
home. There are already over ten millions of white men 
Mid descendant* of white men settled in the tropics; 
and, in fine, as the distinguished authority quoted above

NOTES ON AN ENGLISH LETTER. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have been reading in THE DIAL of September 16 
last, a letter from your London correspondent, and I am 
constrained to write to your journal traversing certain 
statements and opinions which are there advanced. 

I. As to copyright. The Committee of the House of 
Lords on Copyright was appointed in order to seem to 
be doing something. The opinions and facts it has col- 
lected were known to everybody long ago. Nothing 
that was given in evidence is new. So far, the Lords' 
Committee has done nothing to justify its appointment. 
Of course its report may turn out to be valuable. 

II. As to a new Copyright Bill. (1) Nothing is known 
of the intentions of the Government. A bill is now 
being drafted by one of the oldest Parliamentary hands, 
but that does not mean that it will be brought forward. 
The great difficulty in the way is the necessary assertion 
of Imperial copyright. If Canada, for instance, should 
insist upon a copyright Law of her own to protect her 
small body of printers, the Bill will fall to the ground. 
I doubt if the Government means to bring it in, because 
they will not raise the point of Imperial authority if it 
can be avoided. 

(2) Tour correspondent thinks that " the magazine 
has almost ousted from the attention of the reading 
public all books other than those of the first import- 
ance." This opinion seems to me absolutely at variance 
with the facts, which are these: The high-class maga- 
zines, though two or three of them hold their own, do 
not increase greatly in circulation. The old shilling 
magazines seem to be decaying in circulation and in 
influence. More books are published than were ever 
known before; public libraries are springing up all over 
the country, and are crowded with readers of books. 
What, however, has happened is this: Harmsworth and 
Pearson and Newnes have discovered the new mass of 
readers created by the School Boards. They give these 
people what they want something light, amusing, and 
exciting; and their productions sell literally by the 
million. But to infer from this that magazines are 
taking readers from books is ridiculous. Those who 
buy these magazines have never bought books. 

(3) Tour correspondent thinks that publishing of 
the future will be in the hands of a few large syndicates. 
It hardly looks like it, so far. Longmans absorbed 
Rivington and a Rivington started afresh the next 
day. Bentley is absorbed by Macmillan, it is true. But 
in the last few years new publishers have started up 
by the dozen. For instance: Arnold, Percival, Methnen, 
Innes, Heinemann, Constable, Duckworth, Grant Rich- 
ards. And they all seem to be doing well: they have all 
got respectable lists. 

(4) I am sorry to traverse every opinion of Mr. 
Temple Scott. But the truth is that the abolition of 
the three- volume novel has not produced "disastrous 
effects," as he asserts, but the very reverse. Under the 
old system, nobody bought the three-volume novel ex- 



cept three or four circulating libraries; the cot>t of each 
to the library varied from 13s. 6rf. to 15*. Naturally 
the library took as few as possible: of a very popular 
work, perhaps about 1200 to 1800 copies in all. The 
great public, the Colonies, India, were kept from the 
book until a cheap ed itiou was issued t. ., for a twelve- 
month. When it did come out, the demand for the 
book was generally declining and the sale of the cheap 
edition was seldom more than a few thousands. At the 
present moment, when a demand arises for a new book 
it is met at once by the bookseller. A publisher showed 
me the other day the returns of a six-shilling novel by 
a popular author. It was not a " boom," but it was a 
great many thousand copies. By the one-volume novel 
this man must have made double what he could have 
made by the three-volume. A great many novels are 
published which bring in nothing; but they ought not to 
have been published at all. 

(5) Mr. Temple Scott finishes his letter with a fling 
at the Authors' Society, the Publishers' Association, 
and the Booksellers' Association, all three. He says: 
" They none of them know what they want, or how to 
get it if they did." This is the kind of language com- 
monly adopted about the first of these three societies. 
Of course it is rubbish, and, what is worse, it is mis- 
chievous rubbish. All three associations know perfectly 
well what they want: each association wants to get as 
large a share as it can of literary property. The Au- 
thors, however, demand that the division of literary 
property shall be conducted on principles of equity. 
These principles they have long since laid down, and 
repeated over and over again. The Publishers have 
lately shown what they want by issuing " Draft Agree- 
ments." They are very curious and even startling doc- 
uments. They demand in their drafts as a right the 
power of seizing any pay they please, or the whole of 
the profits of a book, however great. They have not 
yet established that right. The Booksellers, who are 
in the most wretched plight, owing to causes which it 
would take too long to explain, know only too well what 
they want, viz : better terms from the publishers. Else 

bankruptcy and ruin. That is quite certain. Bank- 
ruptcy and ruin. I congratulate Mr. Temple Scott on 
his fine sense of humor. He promises himself a hearty 
laugh." I suppose it will begin when the last bookseller, 
with his family, retires to the workhouse, and the last 
author discovers that it is useless to go on writing when 
the publisher allows him nothing. In other words, your 
correspondent looks on while the authors are fighting 
for the independence and the self-respect of literature, 

what they have effected I will ask you to let me tell 
you on another occasion, and while the booksellers, 
with sinking hearts, are struggling for a bare living: he 
proposes to laugh at both. He writes for a literary 
journal, and these are his views on the efforts of literary 
men to raise literature out of dependence !

"REALISM COMES TO STAY." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have by chance come into possession of the follow- 
ing fragmentary MS., purporting to be an eighteenth 
century production. While the formal character of the 
heroic verse in which the author's ideas are couched 
might suggest the epoch in question, there are many 
indications which lead me to think the MS. is of more 
recent origin, as, for instance, the italicized propo- 
sition " Realism comes to stay." It is a curious coinci-

dence, indeed, that those are the very words assigned 
to Mr. W. D. Howells in a newspaper interview appear- 
ing this very year. But, as I am aware, " History repeats 
itself," and the coincidence you may find but casual. 
Allow me to subscribe myself, TIMON OF GOTHAM. 



THE BANISHMENT OF ROMANCE. 

Methought in regions where the Florentine 
Once passed with groping feet, there wandered mine 
(With all humility I haste to say) ; 
And, while I mourned the vanished light of day, 
A star-bright Being towards me bent her way, 
Whose coming roused innumerous dim acclaim. 
' I am Romance (if thou dost seek my name), 
Your little world of letters banished thence ! 
And now it sets in sacred eminence 
An upstart whom it hails as Realism, 
But thou, perchance, art sworn unto that schism ! " 

An hundred quivering lights, as from a prism, 
Played on her starry brows and in her smile. 

' Not yet, Goddess, not yet I defile 
The ancient faith, the only and the true, 
With heresies the fathers never knew ! " 

Then spake the star-bright One : "She sits her throne, 

All pomp, all servitors, dimissed, alone. 

Nor Tyrian dyes, nor ermine, her adorn, 

Nor crown is set upon her locks close-shorn. 

There is no tribute that could please her best, 

And none is more exalt than are the rest ; 

The only peerage she creates by grace, 

The royal Order of The Commonplace ! 

The incense that she most delights to breathe 

It is the effluvium of crowds that seethe 

In proletarian turmoil, cheek by jole ! 

She hath no scrutiny of any soul 

(As was our wont), but of the fleshly case ; 

And there is neither glorious nor base, 

In her esteeming. Yet is Truth her boast, 

But Truth she seeks in regions nethermost. 

And, were a pearly treasure cast to swine, 

Think'st thou to find the pearls she would incline ? 

Nay, rather would the herd in Circe's pen 

Please her as swine than as enchanted men ! " 

Here paused the Presence, and the darkness trembled 
With sighs of those her plaint had there assembled, 
Spirits august, who, while on earth they dwelt, 
In hearts of men had made her empire felt. 

Recall ye, how the souls by us inspired 
Ever to nobler zeal and action fired 
The race they loved, by setting up on high 
Examples eminent that filled the eye, 
And quickened emulation in all breasts, 
That they, too, might be tried by sovran tests ! 
So, these my artists, on large canvas, threw 
Heroic shapes, in living line and hue, 
That all men might the Optimates view, 
And fashion their own lives and deeds thereto. 
What hath the Usurper brought them, of new truth ? 
She hath estranged them from the World's great Youth, 
And taught them downward to direct their gaze, 
To bound their life by breadth of sordid days. 
Now, evermore, meseems I hear them say, 
' With magnitudes and altitudes away ! ' 
The mountains tower above the plain for aye ; 
Yet not the mountains, nor the liquid light 
Poured round those summits, now engage their sight : 
But in some homely spot of spaded ground, 
In ant-reared tumuli, their heights are found I 
The day hath been (but far away it gleams) 
When man did wake, and tell his wondrous dreams ; 
And all that listened were like forest pine 
Long-swaying to the jEolian wave divine ! 
The dream passed on, yet never quite forsook 



The earth it gladdened so. Who now would brook 

To hear a dreamer tell his dream ah, who ? 

To Poesy the poet saith, ' Adieu ! 

Get back to Castaly, or Helicon ; 

Thy reign is past, thou proud, thou lovely one ! 

There is a damsel, of a Doric race ; 

Coarse are her hands, her speech, and blowzed her face. 

She hath constrained me to her heavy pace ; 

And her, perforce, I 've taken in thy place.' " 

Here suddenly broke off her words, amid 
Queries and sighs of those the darkness hid. 
" Epic ? Nay, Epic verse shall be no more. 
There is no heart now beating at the core, 
Nor life of faith, nor red blood in the vein, 
To wake again that old heroic strain. 
The Lyric ? Like a bird with crippled wing 
She soars not, where it was her wont to sing. 
Obscure her melancholy notes, how changed 
From the free songster that with Ariel ranged ! 

' As ill with prose it f areth as with verse ; 
The new Divinity hath laid a curse 
Upon the stylus, that it shall not move 
(Though freedom be its boast) beyond the groove 
Her tyranny prescribes. It is her pleasure 
To say of Human Life, " I take your measure 
By which, hereafter, ever stand confessed 
Plain mediocre, neither worst, nor best ! ' 
So, therefore, do her subjects, each one, strive 
How he may be the dullest scribe alive ! 
Great fiction once from wizard pens did flow ; 
They also spake of what themselves did know. 
They knew what now from casual vision hides - 
How the deep sea of being has its tides, 
When, all at once, some man of men transcends 
His fellows ay, himself, and therehy ends, 
With some great, ne'er-to-be-forgotten act, 
The dull tradition of diurnal fact. 
The last of these my brave artificers 
(Who on the earth leaves no inheritors) 
His birthsong and his cradle Scotia gave, 
The far sea isles a requiem and a grave ! 
Now, in his stead, beneath the anarch rule 
That has ordained the Realistic School, 
Is one all-hailed the foremost Son of Truth, 
Whose art exalts the ribald and uncouth. 
Do ears emasculate, for simple force, 
Mistake the simply ruffianly and coarse ? " 

' Goddess, his fame still runs its fervid course, 
As though they had some maddening brew been tippling. 
All praise him even tender maid and strippling ! 
Yet, sometimes, from his lip a song is blown, 
That thrills the world with its full Orthian tone ! " 

' That song, naught else, shall bid his memory live 
When Aftertimes the high award shall give." 

'* O Sovereign of my lasting fealty," 
I cried, "Shall Aftertimes, then, wiser be 
Than are the wisest of the current day, 
Who hold that Realism comes to stay ? " 

'' Fear not. I shall again resume my sway, 
And she new tribute in my hands shall lay ; 
For so, hath Science done, so all, who thought, 
Usurping, they could bring my power to naught ; 
Since of the oldest dynasty am I, 
Delight of life within my gift doth lie ; 
The heart of man, of woman, and of child, 
Without me were to Fate unreconciled. 
A space hath Human Fashion banished me ; 
But Human Fashion will soon wearied be ! 
I only wait the unfed heart's recall, 
To take my place my place supreme in all. 
Farewell till then." 

So ebbed the Voice away ; 
Darkness and starlight melted into gray, 
And I awakened to the garish day.

> T EO-IUKALI8M IN THE DRAMA.* 

Nothing reconciles me to the denseness with 
which the world is apt to harden itself against 
the lambent life of my ideas more readily than 
the denseness with which I myself occasionally 
exclude the ideas of others. It is partly that 
language alone is not the ideal means of com- 
munication. I am enough of a philologist of 
the school of Talleyrand and Maeterlinck to be 
assured that language is not the best means of 
getting one's ideas about. Anyway, I existed 
calmly for a long time after the production of 
" Cyrano de Bergerac " without even having 
heard that there was such a play. M. Rostand's 
earlier work had aroused a very gentle curiosity 
in my mind ; and as to Cyrano de Bergerac, I 
had never heard of him. When a friend lent 
me a copy of the play, I looked at it mildly, 
and let it lie around without reading it. Soon 
there was so much in the newspapers on the 
matter that I was annoyed, and avoided the 
sight of the book. Another friend then lent 
me another copy, and I let that lie around, too. 
Not even when four copies had come into the 
house was I stirred from my inertia, until a 
kindly fellow-critic, with a little more imagina- 
tion than I have, incited me to read some of 
them. 

After all this, no one will suppose that I 
mean to offer any critical opinions of my own 
on a subject already so publicly possessed. Fer- 
guson discovered many things already known, 
and Emerson approved, saying, " The better 
for him." It may be so ; and yet it would not 
have been the better for the world, had he pub- 
lished his discoveries. No ; there seems to be 
a very general understanding among the critics 
as to the excellence of " Cyrano de Bergerac," 
and I need not add my voice. I may, however, 
remark that the two translations that I have 
seen compare very unfavorably with the best 
translations of plays known to me, Coleridge's 
translations of Schiller for instance, or Fitz- 
Gerald's of Calderon. This is unfortunate, but 
probably unavoidable. Miss Hall's translation 
is chiefly prose, and that of Miss Thomas and 
Miss Guillemard is partly in verse. The ver-

sion used by Mr. Mansfield is said to be verse. 
I have not read it, but my impression from 
hearing it is that there is not much verse, either 
blank or rhymed, in it. But aside from this 
matter (which is an important one, as the play 
in French is in rhymed verse), both transla- 
tions give something of an idea of the original, 
and neither, I should say, would do much more. 
On the whole, I should sty that the translation 
of Miss Thomas and Miss Guillemard gives 
more of an idea of the play as one remembers it 
from the French. 

And this is a matter of appreciable impor- 
tance just here, for in some respects the writ- 
ten play gives one something the acted play 
can probably never give, just as the acted play 
gives something that the written play cannot 
give. But had I the forced choice, to see the 
play two or three times or to have the book, I 
should certainly choose the latter, although the 
play is remarkably put on the stage by Mr. 
Mansfield, and the part extremely well acted by 
him. I had rather have the book, for it con- 
tains things the stage can never give, things 
which I (who am rather an academic haunter 
of libraries, and of cloistered citadels of the 
soul, than a man of that fluent, refreshing cur- 
rent of thought which they call the world) had 
rather have than those things that the stage can 
give and the imagination never. At any rate, 
as an acted play I must leave " Cyrano de Ber- 
gerac " to the dramatic critics, as I have said. 

From the standpoint of literature, however, 
there are some interesting things to be said, 
for in the history of the literature of the nine- 
teenth century Cyrano de Bergerac will be 
a well-remembered figure, would be some- 
thing much more than that, except that people 
do not read plays as they do novels. But even 
as it is, Cyrano de Bergerac is and will remain 
one of the great characters which the French 
literature of our time offers to the world. As 
we look back, any one of us, into the vista of our 
earlier days, and recognize the figures that arise 
from the readings of our youth, the first to strike 
us when we think of our early acquaintance with 
French is the heroic figure of d'Artagnan. Or 
is it perhaps Mauprat? Never mind, the 
elder Dumas and George Sand were the great 
French writers of our earlier days, as they were 
of an earlier part of the century. It must have 
been later in life that we became acquainted with 
the Come'die Humaine and Marguerite Gaatier, 
with Madame Bovary and the Rougon-Macquart 
family. Whether or not it were so in our own 
individual youth, it was practically so with the 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



341 



youth of our time. To readers nourished on 
Byron and Scott, France gave the " Three 
Musketeers" and "Monte Cristo," "Mau- 
prat " and " Consuelo." Then came the turn 
of the tide, and a generation brought up on 
Dickens and Thackeray and George Eliot put 
aside childish things and were thrilled by the 
tragedies of Balzac, Dumas fils, Flaubert, Zola. 
The Realistic movement was general, but 
those were the men who represented France, and 
who created the typical characters that seize the 
imagination and recollection of all. 

And now that the century is coming to an end, 
France presents another figure, and that not 
realistic, but now romantic again, presents 
it to a world which is all ready to enjoy romance 
once more. Just as a generation fed on Scott 
welcomed d'Artagnan, so a generation fed on 
Stevenson welcomes Cyrano de Bergerac. The 
pendulum has swung back again. 

When, after the duel in the first act, a bril- 
liant and heroic musketeer strides out of the 
crowd and shakes the victorious Cyrano by the 
hand and vanishes, the incident is more sig- 
nificant than the audience appreciates. " Who 
is that gentleman ? " says Cyrano to Cuigy. 
" D'Artagnan," says he, and Cyrano turns 
round ; but the older hero is gone, and Cyrano 
holds the attention alone. The two are alike, 
and are different. Both are heroes who fire the 
old-time savage element of the soul, Gascons, 
swordsmen, invincible, men of the dominating 
word and the convincing stroke, hotblooded, 
honorable, heroic. But the difference : one is tall, 
handsome, brilliant, magnificent, and the other 
is almost grotesque. He is cruelly grotesque : 
there is nothing to lighten it ; it is nothing one 
can pity, like a hump or a clubfoot ; nothing 
that one can delude oneself into thinking fine, 
like a mountain belly and a rocky face, or 
a Rochester sort of hideousness. All these 
things the world would forgive or forget. Here 
is something ridiculous, something that would 
make any one of us shiver and writhe if we saw 
it by our own fireside. Here is something that 
touches us cynical, susceptible, bantering people, 
touches us in a very tender place. 

And yet one swallows it, and with it all 
minor matters. Cyrano might by an enemy be 
called^a bully and a braggart, but that we 
forget, as well as his nose ; we feel only that he 
is a noble figure. This is a rather curious 
thing. It is the result of Realism, I take it. 
In the old, old fairy tale, the Beast stopped 
being a beast when he was loved. ^ The mon- 
ster became Cupid. But Realism has pricked 



that bubble, and we know that human nature 
is, and will long continue to be, human. We 
must accept the strange mixture of the god and 
the animal. We must recognize that the old- 
time dreams are dreams, beautiful, encour- 
aging, inspiring, to be remembered and to be 
thankful for, but not truths that we shall ever 
know. Realism has forced upon us the pre- 
eminent thought of our time, that the triumph 
of the spirit is despite the flesh ; and now the 
new Romanticism profits by the lesson. Our 
English romancers did not quite dare. They 
knew, as a general thing, that their heroes must 
not be the old-time impossibilities, but they have 
compromised, as a rule, by having their heroes, 
on the whole, chumps : they did not dare to go 
to the impossible extreme which so often makes 
the type. M. Rostand has dared to do so, and 
he has succeeded. He has drawn a very noble 
character, a man essentially high-minded and 
good. 

It is, to me, a little curious to contrast three 
ideal figures of the English, German, and 
French dramas. I am thinking, beside Cyrano 
de Bergerac, of Heinrich the Bell- founder and 
Marchbanks in " Candida." Of these three 
poets, the only one whom we can really call a 
good man is the Frenchman. Heinrich's ideal- 
ism is such that his poor wife is driven to drown 
herself. Eugene loves the wife of his friend, 
and would take her away if she had not still 
the idea that her husband needed her. Such 
things we pass over in great men, although we 
should be annoyed at them in our personal 
friends. But Cyrano needs no apology. So 
far as the play tells us, he is a good man, kindly, 
unselfish, loyal. Of course, the German and 
the English plays do not shock us, we have 
got bravely over all that. But here is a French 
play that you can go to with oh, various peo- 
ple, say whom for yourself and in such com- 
pany enjoy much more than you would even 
Sodom's Ende " or " The Second Mrs. Tan- 
queray." That seems to me a curious thing. 

Perhaps, then, the most noteworthy fact 

about " Cyrano de Bergerac " is not so much 

that M. Rostand should have written it, as that 

France and the world should have accepted it.

THE EXPANSION OF THE ENGLISH RACE.* 

The fact that the era of rivalry between 
Spain and England for the control of America, 
which in a certain sense began with Columbus 
and Cabot, is just closing, gives renewed interest 
to the period of its beginning. It is a striking 
coincidence that the end of the period should 
have followed so closely the celebration of the 
four-hundredth anniversary of the beginning. 
Only five years ago, Spain joined the United 
States in the celebration of the Columbian dis- 
covery. Who would then have anticipated that 
within so short a time the United States would 
expel Spain from the Western Hemisphere ? 

It is somewhat anomalous that the people of 
the United States devoted all their energies to 
the celebration of the Spanish discovery, and 
left the celebration of the Cabot anniversary 
entirely to the English. North America might 
have been English, had John Cabot never lived ; 
but the fact remains that it is English as the 
result of what he accomplished. His voyage is 
the first link in the chain of events that has 
given the hegemony of the Western world to 
an English-speaking nation. His career ought, 
therefore, to possess an especial interest for us 
as a nation. Although the Cabot literature 
has assumed considerable proportions, there 
has heretofore been no biography of the two 
men, father and son, suited to the needs of 
the general reader and at the same time em- 
bodying the results of the latest historical re- 
search. Such a book has recently been written 
by Mr. C. Raymond Beazley of Merton Col- 
lege, Oxford, and published in the series of 
" Builders of Greater Britain." A similar book 
might with equal propriety be included among 
the brief biographies devoted to the " Makers 
of America." 

The distinguishing characteristic of Mr. 
Beazley's book is his making the original doc- 
uments relating to the Cabots the " backbone " 
of his narrative. This mode of treatment has 
a decided advantage in that it shows the reader 
precisely what the evidence in support of par- 
ticular conclusions is, and how the history of 
past times is reconstructed from obscure and 
scattered materials. The method is especially 
well adapted to a life of the Cabots by reason 
of the small number and brevity of the docu- 
ments that we have relating to them. Mr. 
Beazley does not write as entertainingly of 
old maps and musty manuscripts as does Mr.

America. By C. Raymond Beazley. New York : Longmans, 
Green, 4 Co. 



Fiske, and he fails at times to set out with suf- 
ficient emphasis the salient points of his story ; 
but as a whole the work is excellently done. A 
syllabus of documents and a bibliography of 
Cabot literature are given in an appendix. It 
would have been a convenience had references 
to the syllabus been included in the body of the 
text. 

Mr. Beazley's conclusions upon the principal 
controverted points in the lives of the Cabots 
may be briefly stated. He thinks that the data 
are insufficient for a precise determination of 
the landfall of the first voyage, and that we must 
content ourselves with placing it somewhere 
between Cape Breton and the south coast of 
Labrador, with Cape Race, Newfoundland, as 
likely a place as any for " Priina Vista." He 
rejects Harrisse's theory that the island of St. 
John is fictitious, but regards its identification 
as not at present possible. The evidence of the 
" Cabot map " is accepted as fixing the date of 
landfall at June 24, and Pasqualigo's story that 
Cabot coasted three hundred leagues is discred- 
ited as an exaggeration. The evidence of the 
payment of Cabot's pension, discovered last 
year in the archives of Westminster Abbey, is 
regarded as positive proof of his safe return 
from his second voyage. Sebastian Cabot is 
set down as Venetian born, a conclusion that 
seems reasonably certain, notwithstanding the 
controversy that has grown out of the desire to 
make him out an Englishman. Mr. Beazley 
considers it probable, in the absence of positive 
evidence either way, that Sebastian accom- 
panied his father upon both voyages, but that 
his share in them was unimportant. He con- 
cludes that he was not in any real sense the 
author of the so-called " Cabot map," but that 
he furnished material for some of the inscrip- 
tions and consented that the whole should pass 
under his name. The resuscitation of the south- 
erly landfall, after a suppression of forty years, 
was intended to please the English government, 
but was put out in such a way that it could 
easily be repudiated if the Spanish authorities 
objected. In his estimate of Sebastian Cabot's 
character, Mr. Beazley strikes a happy mean. 
He admits that he appropriated his father's 
achievements, and that he was intriguing and 
deceitful, but contends that he could not have 
won and retained the exalted opinion in which 
he was held by the foremost of his contempo-

his name is usually associated, and rests mainly 
upon the expedition of 1553 in search of a 
Northeast passage. That he was the chief pro- 
moter of this voyage is clear from the fact that 
the charter of the Muscovy Company made him 
Governor for life, for the reason that " he was 
the chief est setter forth of this journey." Mr. 
Beazley fully recognizes the importance of this 
expedition. The voyages of John Cabot, he 
says, had not really aroused the nation. It was 
the enterprise of 1553 that awoke the English 
people to their mission in exploration, trade, 
and colonization ; it was the real beginning of 
English exploring activity, wider commercial 
ambitions, and of national interest in schemes 
of discovery : it was the starting-point of 
Greater Britain. In the initiation of this great 
movement Sebastian Cabot played the leading 
role, and he is entitled to the credit for having 
done so, notwithstanding the fact that the re- 
sults achieved were not the ones intended. 

There is one phase of the voyage of 1553 
which Mr. Beazley and the other biographers 
of Sebastian Cabot overlook. That voyage was 
the first application of the trading corporation 
to purposes of discovery. It was a new appli- 
cation of an old force, analogous in the phys- 
ical world to the application of steam to navi- 
gation. The Muscovy Company, which resulted 
from this voyage, was the prototype of the great 
corporations by which England acquired em- 
pire in India, planted her colonies in America, 
preempted the region of Hudson's Bay, and in 
our own day has exploited Central Africa. The 
fact that the ships of the Muscovy Company 
brought the first colonists to Jamestown is inter- 
esting as showing how closely English schemes 
for discovery in diverse directions were con- 
nected. Spain and France devoted infinite 
pains to the up-building of colonial empires, 
but their colonies were weakened by paternal- 
ism, impoverished by corruption, and alienated 
by despotism. England left everything to indi- 
vidual enterprise, and individual enterprise 
operated through the corporation. The result 
has been the expansion of little England into 
two great English-speaking nations, whose com- 
bined power extends to every corner of the 
globe. Upon the threshold of this movement 
stood John and Sebastian Cabot. The one 
furnished a basis for the claim which England 
made at a later date to North America ; the 
other aroused an interest in foreign trade and 
discovery, which ripened into colonization, and 
pointed the way by which success was achieved.

WILLIAM MORRIS: His WORK AND 
His 



In a large measure, Mr. Vallance's book on 
William Morris is a revelation, since it is, per- 
haps, the first time the entire product of Mor- 
ris's life has been arranged so as to be evident 
as a whole. Hitherto, such of us as possessed 
any of the poetic virus have concerned our- 
selves with his poetry, vaguely conscious that 
he also " made things." Such as were crafts- 
men have admired and studied his product in 
their especial line, unconscious for the most 
part that he also " wrote things." Biblioma- 
niacs of course centred their interest at Kelms- 
cott. Here, however, we have a record, an ad- 
mirably impersonal one, which yet gives a grave 
impression of a marvellous many-sided person- 
ality ; and as this impersonal record piles up 
effort after effort, successful all, endeavor after 
endeavor in many varied and different lines, 
achievement after achievement, the effect is 
received of a product whose bulk and quality 
make it a fit monument for six men. If we 
regard but the mere output, the result is over- 
whelming ; but this again has to be empha- 
sized by the fact that in many cases the actual 
method had to be invented or rediscovered. 
Taking the case of tapestry, Mr. Val lance tells 

us that : 

" At the time when it occurred to him to start hand- 
weaving according to the ancient plan, it had become 
extinct in this country [England]. In default of any 
existing instance available where the actual weaving 
process might be observed, Morris had to pick up the 
details of the craft as best he might from an old French 
official handbook, published prior to the Revolution. 
He caused a handloom to be set up in his bedroom at 
Kelmscott House, and, so as not to let this new under- 
taking of his interfere with his ordinary occupations, he 
used to rise betimes, and practice weaving in the early 
hours of the morning." (Page 113, et seq.) 

Turning from this description to the beauti- 
ful illustrations of some ultimate results at 
pages 118 and 120, we have a very vivid pre- 
sentation of a notable achievement, albeit one 
which the world, especially the American world, 
regards with suspicion. Similar action was, un- 
fortunately, necessary in nearly every craft with 
which Morris concerned himself, and in dye- 
ing, weaving, stained glass, printing, stamping, 
as well as tapestry, he had first to lay new 
foundations for the art, or else to dig deeply in 
search of them through the rubbish with which 
our own and preceding generations had buried 
them. If anyone at any time wished to write

an essay on inceptions or origins, this book 
would be a veritable mine of examples ; and the 
initial experiments, conducted in scullerys, 
attics, and coach-houses, are, in view of their 
developments, most inspiring incidents for 
workers. 

In realizing the astonishing sum of Morris's 
work, it is not only the sheer industry which is 
remarkable, but the industry animated by a high 
ideal, a fine enthusiasm. Mere industry is often 
pitiful. The application and self - surrender 
necessary to establish and carry on most of the 
large industrial organizations is painful in view 
of the fact that the only outcome of this good 
effort is an addition to the sum of existing 
hideousness. But industry which gives knowl- 
edge where before was only vague groping, 
which recalls to the social memory delights and 
possibilities it was in danger of forgetting, which 
evolves principles out of confusion, in that 
sort of industry lays the significance of Morris's 
life. This sort of effort is always viewed askance 
by the public and damned with the popular 
anathema of impracticability, because, first, the 
popular mind is very slow to comprehend any 
other actuating motive than that of self-interest, 
and, secondly, it is slower to perceive that, 
tested even by popular standards, human inter- 
est as a motive is always the most practical. 
The ordinary producer says, " Unless I make 
my work bad I cannot sell it," and makes it as 
bad as possible in order to sell as much as 
possible, cheerfully conscious that he can always 
furnish an alibi of bad intentions. Mr. Edward 
Lloyd, in an interesting essay, has shown that 
it has been those men who had the courage to 
give the public that which it did not want, but 
which it was good for it to have, who have made 
the greatest sales : Mr. Raskin, in the actual 
amount the public has paid to possess writings 
with which it violently disagreed ; Morris, in 
the actual amount paid to possess his industrial 
products by a public who clamored for picto- 
rial hearth-rugs ; and Wagner, in the fabulous 
amounts paid by the public to hear musio which 
at first evoked only witticisms and hoots. This 
standard of narrow self-interest is like that 
numerical standard of certain primitive races, 
the hand, a standard which does not promote 
counting, but limits counting beyond a cer- 
tain number. Morris, following Ecclesiastes, 
preached his art propaganda from the text, 
" Let every man rejoice in his own works, for 
that is his portion," and that was his practise. 
The industrial mind, limited by its standard 
of self-interest, and unable to count so many 



men, ingenuously paraphrased the text as " Let 
every man rejoice in Morris's works." Hence 
the many imitations. These will of course pass 
away, as did the bulk of the spurious Chippen- 
dales and Sheratons ; and when the air is clear 
again we shall see Morris occupying his true 
and very important position in the historical 
sequence of art. 

At present the air is not clear ; but Mr. 
Vallance's book, with its strong current of sane 
and impersonal record, will do much to clear 
it, especially in connection with that prize con- 
undrum, Was Morris a mediae valist, or was 
he not? This is a very difficult subject to 
discuss, because nobody ever troubles to define 
accurately what is meant by the medievalist 
Morris was supposed to be. Broadly inter- 
preted, the accusation is that Morris reproduced 
European mediaeval designs, decoration, furni- 
ture, glass, and printing, which were well 
enough for the times and manners from which 
they grew, but which are not indigenous to 
our own conditions and are consequently un- 
important exotics. I have even heard the 
Kelmscott Press called a Society for the Sup- 
pression of Knowledge, on account of the limited 
editions of its publications. Morris, of course, 
never proposed to supply the whole world with 
books ; he only determined that what books he 
did supply should be good in every particular. 
With regard to the other productions, it must 
be remembered that there are certain things 
which are persistent, certain principles which 
always obtain. This is true of principles of 
design and construction no less than of such 

O 

accepted principles as the equality of the angles 
at the base of an isosceles triangle, or the fal- 
lacy of counting chickens before they are 
hatched, principles which have been persist- 
ent factors in geometry and conduct from very 
early periods, the acceptance of which does not 
lay one open to charges of anachronism, as in 
the present case. One is fortunately able to 
retort to this charge with a counter-accusation, 
a mode highly recommended by Schopen- 
hauer in the " Art of Controversy." The anti- 
mediaevalists have no historic sense. If they 
were able to project themselves back into early 
Victorian days they would find an age clut- 
tered up with very bad Greek imitations, very 
bad Renaissance imitations, very bad Gothic 
imitations, combined with our own proud con- 
tributions of horsehair upholstery and cast- 
iron fireplaces. These represented Art and 
Progress at the first Crystal Palace Exhibition 
where Morris & Co. made their first exhibits of

furniture and tapestry which were awarded 
prizes. In designing these articles, Morris had 
first of all been obliged to burrow back, so to 
speak, through the horsehair suits, cast-iron 
fireplaces, neo-Grec and Wyatt-Gothic abom- 
inations, to find the lost thread of the princi- 
ples of industrial art and applied design. These 
he found for various arts in various periods in 
various places, and carefully avoiding the sharp 
edges of cast-iron and stucco, he has drawn it 
down and pieced on to it, and placed it care- 
fully in our hands, that the addition of our 
spinning may carry it forward into the next 
age. The astonishing point is, that as long as 
people merely copied old forms they were 
placidly accepted as art without question ; but 
as soon as one man began to work with the old 
spirit, which is old and new, and ever will be, 
though disregarded sometimes and forgotten, 
a protest is evoked. Laws and principles are 
persistent factors, with slightly varying aspects 
for each generation. As Tennyson, with the 
mythical forms of Arthur and his Court, ex- 
pressed the persistent principles of honor, 
truth, and justice, as Wagner uses not Sieg- 
fried but Siegfried's strength and Parsifal's 
purity, so Morris, whatever the form (and no 
one has called Tennyson mediaeval, in spite of 
his association with Malory) uses the everlast- 
ing principles of art. That is the difference 
between him and his forerunners and imitators, 
a difference of spirit ; and it is not the par- 
ticular forms he uses which are the essential, 
but the fact that his decoration has two planes, 
that its line is strong and supple, that mass 
and void are well balanced, and that all rela- 
tions are organic ones. 

The whole point is trivial, and were it not 
that in the minds of those people whom Walter 
Bagehot calls social cement it militates against 
the sweet, strong, healthy influence of Morris, 
it would be a neglectable quality. But having 
pursued it so far, it now becomes intensely 
interesting. For it is plain that if a knowledge 
of decorative origins were more widespread 
Morris would have been branded as a Persian 
also. For he not only, as stated, went back to 
the time when a particular craft reached its 
highest development, but he also went to any 
country where that occurred ; and it is in cer- 
tain products of Persia that the best manifes- 
tation of certain principles of design may be 
found. India at present is an interesting con- 
undrum in this particular regard. There the 
debasing influence of the English occupation 
on the indigenous arts is becoming painfully 



apparent, and it is being further degraded by 
the manufacture, by the government, in the 
prisons and reformatories, of carpets and woven 
goods of an exceeding cheap and nasty descrip- 
tion. There is no particular necessity for the 
government to manufacture carpets in the jails, 
and all it cares for is to make the shops self- 
supporting ; so the superintendents have to 
work down to the level of a mercantile taste 
which wants a cheap grade of goods. The con- 
tract for entirely furnishing the new vice- regal 
palace at Simla was given to a manufacturer in 
the Tottenham Court Road, with the swift result 
that the Guikwar of Baroda also refurnished 
his palace throughout with European stuffs and 
furniture. If the disaster stopped here we 
might still be complacent, and even slightly 
sorry for the Viceroy and the Guikwar envi- 
roned by Tottenham Court Road products in a 
land of beautiful woodwork and weavings ; but 
we are much more intimately concerned. Baden- 
Powell has told us how, as a consequence of 
these acts of the high, the skilful carpenters of 
India, with a taste for progress and modern 
improvements, now abandon their old principles 
of ornament and forms, and hasten to produce 
copies of English furniture the designs for 
which they procure from the rough cuts and 
perspectives of the manufacturer's catalogue. 
The importation of analine dyes is also increas- 
ing rapidly, and a proportionate substitution 
of strong garish tints for the old soft-color 
beauty of Indian fabrics is taking place. 

This degradation of the carpet-making, wood- 
work, weaving and dyeing of India is an exact 
parallel to what occurred to English arts and 
crafts during the Post- Renaissance period ; 
and the question is, when they are unbearably 
degraded will India say in the twenty-fifth 
century produce a Ruskin and a Morris to 
gather together for human delight that which 
we are so wantonly destroying in the nineteenth 
century ? The most hopeful part of the situa- 
tion is that Morris perceived the tendency, and 
immediately started the manufacture of carpets. 
" The East," he said, " is going to fail us ; 
therefore we had better make our own carpets." 
This has raised the standard of design in En- 
gland ; and certain French and American firms, 
large customers of the Indian jails, have sup- 
plied them with some of the best examples of 
the Indian mediaeval work, and insist that their 
orders be filled with copies of these. In a 
debased age we have to hold on to the best 
existing examples. This action of the exporters, 
however, unfortunately does not affect the dye-

ing or woodwork. If anyone will look at this 
slow but relentless degradation and killing of 
the native arts of India, and realize the enor- 
mous effort which would be necessary to oppose 
it, even at this initial stage, he will have some 
idea of the work done by Ruskin and Morris in 
a land where such deterioration had been in 
process for a long period.

WASHINGTON IN HIS DAILY LIFE.* 



A melancholy interest attaches to the publi- 
cation of " Washington after the Revolution," 
by the late William Spohn Baker, the Phila- 
delphia antiquarian and connoisseur. It seemed 
peculiarly fitting that this indefatigable collec- 
tor and investigator should have devoted him- 
self to gathering biographies of the foremost 
American and to collecting facts concerning 
him. The addition of a volume on " Washing- 
ton after the Revolution " completes the chain 
begun several years since in " Early Sketches 
of Washington" and in "The Itinerary of 
General Washington from 1775 to 1783." 

It is sufficient for our interest in most men 
to know the great deeds they accomplished, the 
benefits they left to posterity, and the best 
points in their respective characters. But the 
love and veneration felt for Washington by his 
countrymen cause them to demand the most 
minute details concerning him. It is not suf- 
ficient to know that he existed day by day, but 
we would know precisely what he was doing 
day by day. Hence the thought of Mr. Baker 
in supplying a calendar in which the where- 
abouts and occupation of Washington could be 
described from his journals and letters, as well 
as from records, newspapers, and the writings 
of others. 

The public has had so much of the tradi- 
tional, the sentimental, and the frothy, concern- 
ing the great Virginian, ranging in time from 
Weems to Walter, that one hails this revival 
of the authentic and the trustworthy. Contem- 
poraries are apt to paint a man as he is. To 
divest Washington, as his eulogists do, of the 
environment of the wealthy Virginian, to take

away his aristocratic feeling, to explain away 
those outbursts of Southern temper, to heat up 
that cold reserve in which he commonly cloaked 
himself, is to lose sight of the man in the demi- 
god ; but in contemplating him day by day in 
Mr. Baker's record one cannot lose sight of 
the very busy and thrifty planter, plain, prac- 
tical, yet never so much engaged in private 
affairs as to neglect his duty as a citizen. 

There is a fascination in accompanying the 
great man in his daily occupations and amuse- 
ments, chasing the fox in Virginia for a half- 
day and disgusted at ending with a " cold 
scent," receiving guests of state in the national 
capital on New Year's Day, attending the the- 
atre, assisting at a lottery drawing, overseeing 
the carving of the city of Washington out of 
the primeval woods, complaining about a domes- 
tic crisis caused by the flight of the negro cook, 
growing " quite merry " over the champagne, 
sitting to the portrait painters like a sheep in the 
shambles, and making the little meteorological 
entries in his journal until the hand of dis- 
ease and approaching death grasped the pen 
after the entry of " Mer 48 at Night," on Fri- 
day, December 13, 1799. 

The most amusing of the many glimpses 
afforded us come from the French tourists, vol- 
untary and involuntary, who, having mistaken 
the American political revolution for a French 
social revolution, are rather stunned by the 
surroundings of Washington as president and 
as ex-president, and are at a loss to understand 
the superior social standing assumed by him 
and allowed by his fellows. But they content 
themselves with dwelling on the more than mor- 
tal benignancy of his countenance and the more 
than human wisdom of his judgment. 

Being strictly a compilation, the volume lacks 
the impress of an author's individuality. None 
will claim that it was a useless task, since the 
volume will be a storehouse of accessible mate- 
rial for the student and a source of delight to 
young people interested in contemplating the 
character of the true Washington. It clothes 
with flesh and blood the classic statue erected 
by the panegyrists. Like its prototype, the 
dictionary, this book makes good reading at 
any point where it may chance to be opened. 
The compiler has supplied footnotes explana- 
tory of the names mentioned in the context, and 
at times has inserted necessary connecting 
notes. It is difficult to imagine any improve- 
ment on the execution of the plan.

RECENT STUDIES IN CURRENCY AND 
FINANCE.* 



Recent attempts to solve the currency problem 
show a disposition to treat the subject in a calmer 
and less confident manner than was customary a 
few years ago. Each party to the controversy has 
come to recognize the validity of at least some of 
its opponents' arguments, and to appreciate that a 
treatment of the question which gives due consid- 
eration to these contrary opinions is likely to lead 
to more permanent, if less positive, results than were 
obtained by the more dogmatic methods of earlier 
writers. 

Mr. Russell, the author of " International Money 
Conferences," is doubtless right in his opinion that 
" an understanding of the Silver Question cannot 
be had from conditions that obtain in the United 
States alone." He has set forth, in a clear and gen- 
erally impartial manner, the international circum- 
stances that have been influential in determining 
the trend of our monetary and financial history dur- 
ing the last thirty years. Four international con- 
ferences have been held during that time, and it 
would seem that the chances of securing an inter- 
national agreement have been in about an inverse 
ratio to the number of times the effort to secure 
such an agreement has been made. The Conference 
of 1867 came near to reaching an agreement for an 
international coinage system based on a gold stand- 
ard and on the French system of coinage, in spite 
of the fact that the Latin Monetary Union, then 
only two years old, had adopted the bimetallic stand- 
ard. The delegates to the Conference, for the most 
part, seemed enthusiastic over the idea ; and had it 
not been for the Franco-Prussian war, and the down- 
fall of Louis Napoleon, who had been the chief 
promoter of the universal coinage scheme, the advo- 
cates of international monetary unity might have 
seen their hopes realized. 

For nearly a decade the trend of monetary history 
was in the direction of the gold standard. Germany 
abandoned bimetallism ; so did the Scandinavian 
states, and Holland prepared to do so. In the 
United States, the gold standard, which the Amer- 
ican delegate to the Paris Conference of 1867 had 
called " an American idea yielded reluctantly by 
France and other countries," was introduced in 
1873, with but little opposition from within Congress

or without, and such opposition as did arise came 
" from commercial centres like New York City." 
The cause of the gold standard was championed by 
the very men who later denounced the suspension 
of the silver coinage as a secret crime. But the 
decrease in the production of gold and the efforts 
of European countries to establish a gold standard 
began to cause a feeling of alarm lest the supply of 
that metal should prove insufficient. At the same 
time, the increase in silver production, the sale of 
silver by European countries, and the substitution 
of council bills for silver in the trade between En- 
gland and India, caused a fall in the price of that 
metal. 

An effort to restore silver to its old place in the 
coinage of the leading nations led to the Conference 
of 1878. This was the first international attempt 
to establish a bimetallic standard. The suggestion 
of the conference came from Holland, although the 
invitations were issued by the United States. Noth- 
ing of a practical nature was accomplished at this 
meeting. Italy was the only European country to 
give strong support to the propositions presented by 
the American delegates. Other countries seemed 
anxious lest the further adoption of the gold stand- 
ard should lessen the supplies of that metal for their 
own use ; but they were not willing themselves to 
abandon that standard. 

The next conference, that of 1881, accomplished 
even less than its predecessor. Great Britain and 
Germany were willing to make what they regarded 
as concessions to silver, provided the United States 
and the Latin Union would reopen their mints to 
the free coinage of the white metal. But the French 
and American delegates considered the concessions 
unimportant, and decided that " nothing could result 
till the stress of circumstances had become more 
severe in Great Britain and Germany." The Con- 
ference adjourned temporarily, to allow the French 
and American governments to formulate a practical 
programme, but it never reassembled. 

Eleven years passed before the third attempt was 
made to secure an international bimetallic agree- 
ment. During this interval, however, the friends of 
silver were not idle. Disregarding the advice of 
the delegates to the Conference of 1881, the Amer- 
ican supporters of silver began an agitation in favor 
of free coinage by the United States alone. The 
passage of a free-coinage measure was prevented 
only by the enactment of the bullion-purchase act of 
1890. From the standpoint of international bimet- 
alism, this silver agitation and legislation was highly 
detrimental. It prevented the very "stress of cir- 
cumstances," upon which the French and American 
international bimetallists had depended, from being 
severely felt in either Germany or Great Britain, 
and continued Europe in the " state of expectancy " 
of still further silver legislation in America. Under 
these circumstances, the Conference of 1892 accom- 
plished nothing. It continued in session only a 
month, considered a number of plans for increasing 
the use of silver as money, debated once more the

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



question of bimetallism, but did not even take a vote 
on any of the plans discussed. 

Mr. Russell's conclusion, which certainly seems 
justified by the history he has given us, is that the 
cause of international bimetallism will prosper only 
when " the United States stop begging and pleading 
and voting for free silver, and go to work earnestly 
to secure and to keep gold," a programme of action 
which monometallists will heartily endorse, although 
for quite different reasons than the desire to promote 
international bimetallism. 

Some of the difficulties to be overcome before the 
cooperation of England can be secured in the estab- 
lishment of a bimetallic standard are exposed by 
Major Leonard Darwin in his book on " Bimetallism." 
Major Darwin may not voice the sentiments of the 
majority of English bimetallism, he would prob- 
ably not profess to do so, but a perusal of his book 
will show the reader that the unwillingness of Great 
Britain to enter into an international bimetallic union 
with the United States and the countries composing 
the Latin Union is not entirely due to British obsti- 
nancy or to the opposition of the creditor classes. 
The reasons for supporting bimetallism in England 
are, in part, quite different from the arguments put 
forward in its support in the United States, or even 
on the Continent. In this country the demand for 
bimetallism in so far as it is not made by silver 
mine-owners comes mainly from those who are 
seeking a higher price for their commodities, especi- 
ally agricultural produce. They believe that it would 
inaugurate an era of rising prices, to take the place 
of the period of falling prices which has continued 
for a quarter-century. But in England there is little 
demand for a rise in the price of commodities. 
The agricultural classes have little influence as com- 
pared to the commercial and laboring classes. Neither 
of these latter classes desires high prices of commodi- 
ties. The arguments in behalf of bimetallism which 
appeal most strongly to the English trading and 
industrial classes are (1) that it would establish 
a steady rate of exchange with silver-using coun- 
tries, such as India and China, and (2) that it would 
increase English trade with those countries by check- 
ing the competition of the native producers. They 
do not desire, therefore, to enter into an agreement 
to coin silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, or at the French 
ratio of 15 to 1. Major Darwin argues in favor 
of the market ratio at the time of the international 
agreement, let that ratio be what it may, 20 to 1 
or 40 to 1. This would, he thinks, tend to keep 
prices from falling as much as they have fallen under 
the gold standard, and yet would prevent them from 
rising, and thus the imputation of dishonesty due to 
the introduction of the double standard would be 
avoided. If the object of bimetallists, he says, is to 
force up prices, " I, for one, am prepared to meet 
them as an open foe." Silver, he thinks, used as 
a single standard corresponds closely to the " com- 
modity standard," t. e., one which keeps the price 
of commodities at a level. Gold, used alone, corre- 
sponds more nearly to the " labor standard," t. ., 



one which keeps the output of a certain quantity 
of labor at a constant price. The perfect standard, 
our author says, lies between these two limits, but 
approaches nearer the commodity standard than the 
labor standard ; and market-ratio bimetallism, he 
thinks, would furnish this perfect standard. H e does 
not seem hopeful of securing the necessary interna- 
tional agreements for the adoption of market-ratio 
bimetallism, but says that "this is no argument 
against trying to obtain them." 

To frame a plan of monetary reform which thall 
embody, " first, the essential principles of the advo- 
cates of the gold standard ; second, of the advocates 
of free silver coinage ; and third, of that large body 
of American citizens who regard government paper 
money as superior to bank-notes," is a task which 
to ordinary mortals seems beyond human power to 
accomplish. But Mr. William Brough, the author 
of "Open Mints and Free Banking," does not regard 
the task as especially difficult of accomplishment. 
On the contrary, he presents us, in 170 small pages, 
with a plan which, in his opinion, will not only settle 
the differences between the above mentioned parties, 
but will prevent a recurrence of " currency panics " 
in the future. He believes that the currency diffi- 
culties in the past and present have been due mainly 
to the attempts of governments to maintain gold and 
silver as equivalent legal tenders at a given ratio, 
and to determine in advance what supply of money 
is necessary for local industrial and trading com- 
munities. He is of the opinion that to these com- 
munities should be left the task of supplying money 
as their needs arise, and that each community should 
be left to adopt as its measure of value the metal 
which best serves its particular needs. He urges, 
therefore, that all laws which go to make silver and 
gold dollars an equivalent tender should be repealed. 
He would then open the mints to free coinage of both 
metals without any definite ratio, and would allow 
all banks to issue notes subject to redemption on 
demand in the metallic money which they represent. 
The Secretary of the Treasury should not be obliged 
to pay out and to keep in circulation any specified 
kind of money. As a forerunner to these changes, 
our author would have the nation pledge itself to 
the payment in gold of its present outstanding obli- 
gations. He displays considerable acumen in dis- 
cussing monetary principles, but does not make it 
very clear how these principles support the changes 
proposed by him. 

** Norman's Universal Cambist" is a practical 
treatise on exchange, whose main object, as stated 
by its author, is " to set forth in the plainest man- 
ner possible, with examples (1) the most simple 
and direct modes of arriving at the world's fixed 
and absolute par of exchange ; (2) the mode of 
determining the equivalent commercial exchanges 
limited by the cost of the transmission of metal ; 
(3) coinage charges ; and (4) interest for the use 
of money when such a charge is included in the rate 
of exchange." Besides the valuable tables which

short articles what the author considers to be the 
true " science of money." 

" Republican Responsibility for Present Currency 
Perils " is a republication of a series of articles 
written by Mr. Perry Belmont for the " Brooklyn 
Citizen " last December. The author finds the 
Republican party responsible for " the unconstitu- 
tional greenbacks," for the suppression of the note- 
issues of State banks ; for the establishment of the 
system of national banks, " more powerful if they 
could be united in the hands of one political party 
than the ' bank ' destroyed by Jackson "; for the 
abandonment of bimetallism, and for the subsequent 
uncertainty in regard to the currency standard. As 
a political pamphlet, the work may possess some 
value. As a serious scientific study in our financial 
history, it is of little importance. The two Demo- 
cratic administrations since the Civil War have, it 
is true, been seriously handicapped by previous 
Republican evasions in currency matters, but the 
record of the votes in Congress shows that neither 
party can be freed from responsibility. 

For a proper understanding of our recent cur- 
rency difficulties, no work has been so much needed 
as a clear and compact history of the financial opera- 
tions of the United States Government since the 
close of the Civil War. This we now have, in Mr. 
A. D. Noyes's " Thirty Years of American Finance." 
As its title indicates, the work concerns itself not so 
much with the currency problem as with the broader 
aspects of public finance ; but the reader is made to 
appreciate, as perhaps he never has done before, 
how much the late confusion and distress, and even 
the present uncertainty, in regard to our currency 
are due to the unwise financial management of the 
Civil War and the subsequent delay in the refund- 
ing operations and in the contraction of our paper 
currency. The author shows no hesitation in his 
criticism of either men or measures, and his own 
opinions are never in doubt ; but on the whole, the 
book is less extreme in its attitude than might have 
been expected from an editorial writer on the New 
York " Evening Post." Opinions must differ widely 
concerning many public acts and the policies of 
many public men, and there are doubtless many who 
will find the author's treatment of Secretaries Sher- 
man and Windom unusually severe. But there is 
no evidence of a desire to treat these men, or others, 
unfairly. The criticism is a natural result of the 
author's attitude toward the financial problems 
which these men were called upon to solve. Finan- 
cial measures and financial events are not treated by 
themselves, but their relation to the political history 
and economic development of the country is kept 
steadily in mind. Reliance is not placed upon sec- 
ondary authorities; the record is entirely from 
original sources, and the author speaks with the 
authority of a man long accustomed to dealing with 
the material which furnishes him with his evidence. 
The book is written in a clear and even style, and, 
in spite of the exact information which it contains, 
the record is never lacking in interest. 



In passing to Professor Durand's book, " The 
Finances of New York City," we leave entirely the 
field of currency, and have to do with questions of 
public finance alone. The field of local finance 
in the United States is one filled with difficulties 
and one which has hitherto remained almost entirely 
unworked. Professor Durand is the first writer to 
present us with anything like a comprehensive treat- 
ment of the finances of even one municipality. In 
spite of the small geographical area with which the 
book deals, the extent of the financial field is by no 
means insignificant. Only four States of the Union 
have a population as large as that of the Greater 
New York ; the public expenditures of the consoli- 
dated city are nearly two- thirds as large as those of 
all the States in the Union, while the city's gross 
debt exceeds that of all the States combined. The 
financial history of New York resembles that of 
most of our American municipalities in teaching 
chiefly what not to do. The government of our 
cities is generally recognized as the most conspicuous 
failure in our public administration, and it is scarcely 
too much to say that our next greatest failure has 
been in the management of our finances. Hence, 
when we find these two failures combined, the record 
is not a pleasing one to patriotic Americans. New 
York's experience with the Tweed Ring is remark- 
able, not because of its exceptional character, but 
because of its magnitude, for practically the same 
record of the stealing of public funds can be found 
in the history of franchise-granting and the con- 
struction of public buildings in all our large cities. 
The results of this disgraceful chapter in New 
York's financial history may still be seen, not only 
in the enormous debt, amounting to about sixty 
dollars per capita, but in the character of the char- 
ter government with its many anomalies that has 
prevailed since that time. About one-third of Pro- 
fessor Durand's book is given up to a history of the 
city's finances to the end of Tweed rule ; the re- 
mainder is devoted to a description and criticism of 
the financial system since that time. While the 
adoption of the Greater New York charter undoubt- 
edly furnishes a fitting closing point for a treatment 
of the city's finances, it is in some ways to be re- 
gretted that the author did not continue his historical 
narrative down to this point, and confine his descrip- 
tion of the present system to the workings under 
the new charter. In this way he would have avoided 
many administrative details which possess little 
interest because not a part of the present system. 
The new charter itself receives from the author 
some sharp criticisms. The budget system, the 
management of the sinking funds, and the power to 
authorize debt issues, are faulty under the present 
charter, as they were under the old one. Reform 
in these as in other matters will come only with the 
growth of the civic spirit among the people, and with 
a better understanding of the need of the city and its 
methods of administration. To the accomplishment 
of these ends Professor Durand's book should prove 
an important means. M. B. HAMMOND.

Heraldry for Ameri- 
cans" (The Century Co. ) is a title 
no t i j k,. that of the famous chapter 
on snakes in the history of Ireland. At least it would 
be, were it not for the highly reassuring message its 
author, Dr. Edward S. Holden, brings to the socially 
aspiring in the statement that it is entirely legal and 
permissible for any person to assume coat armor, 
provided only he does not take to himself the armo- 
rial bearings of someone else. Benjamin Franklin 
sought and obtained an achievement of arms, we are 
told ; and it is said to be altogether likely that the 
stripes in the national ensign were obtained from 
Washington's well-known blazoning. Recalling the 
difficulty some of Franklin's kinsfolk had, a few years 
ago, in obtaining admission into one of the so-called 
patriotic societies, the rather pitiful pretension of his 
shield does not seem to have made a pronounced 
impression upon his countrymen, who based their 
objection entirely, if memory serves aright, upon his 
plebeian birth and democratic bearing. So far as 
Washington's " argent, two bars gules, in chief two 
mullets of the last " having provided the field for 
the " grand union " flag under which the thirteen 
colonies typified themselves by thirteen stripes alter- 
nately red and white, Washington has never been 
shown to have had the slightest connection with it, 
nor is it needful to seek further than the well-known 
banner of the free city of Lubeck for its pattern. 
Dr. Holden illustrates, moreover, the fatality which 
seems to befall heralds when they attempt to blazon 
the bearings in the great seal of state of the nation. 
He points out specifically that the shield in it has 
seven white and six red stripes for no earthly 
reason that has ever been discovered and that the 
blue " chief " is starless, those luminaries having 
been reserved for the crest These are facts which 
the American appears to spurn, for all the battle- 
ships bear the national shield with more red stripes 
than white on their prows, and everybody inserts 
stars to suit his fancy upon it. Glorious examples 
of ignorance in these particulars may also be seen in 
the coats-of-arms of the City of Chicago and of the 
State of Illinois, both assuming designs in open viola- 
tion of the laws each has passed, as well as of the laws 
of heraldry. It is easy to find excuses for an alder- 
man or state legislator in respect of such matters ; 
but what is to be said of Mr. Holden 's blazoning the 
American shield as " argent, six pallets gules, a chief 
azure," which would make the red stripes in it 
wider than the white, when the statute in such case 
made and provided reads simply, " Pale ways of thir- 
teen Pieces Argent and Gules ; a Chief Azure " ? 
When Captain Totten published his work on the 
Great Seal, he succeeded in reading " paleways " 
as a plural noun, and discoursed learnedly about 
a " pale way." The word is, of course, an adverb, 
the equivalent of " paly," meaning a perpendicular 
dividing of the shield. Mr. Holden also errs in 



of minor

describing the glory above the shield by way of crest, 
though consultation of the act of Congress would have 
put him right. Finally, the work should have set forth 
the various badges adopted by the "hereditary" 
societies, if only to show how much like a profusely 
decorated foreigner an American of happy ancestry 
can look. We commend to the ambitions in such 
matters Warburton's wise dictum : " High birth is 
a thing which I never knew anyone to disparage 
except those who had it not ; and I never knew 
anyone to make a boast of it who had anything else 
to be proud of." 

One could hardly find a more incon- 
gruous couple than James Thomson 
and Robert Fergusson, whose lives 
have been lately added to the " Famous Scots 
Series " (imported by Scribners). They may, per- 
haps, be rightly called a couple, for they were both 
poets, both Scotch, both of the eighteenth century, 
although not contemporary, for they followed, as it 
happened, one upon the other, Thomson living 
through the first half of the century, and Fergusson 
the third quarter only. Probably very few people 
read either now. Thomson is a minor classic, and 
so pretty certainly unread by the majority ; Fer- 
gusson can hardly be said ever to have been very 
generally known outside of Scotland. But the two 
men offer two interesting types : one, the hard- 
working, easy-going poet, in time successful ; the 
other, the unappreciated and often extravagant 
genius, living by the hardest efforts and often dying 
in misery. Those are typical artists' lives, with 
the trifling exception that with these two there is 
enough known of them a hundred and fifty years 
after they are dead to warrant their lives being 
written. The books are different in merit. Dr. 
A. B. Grosart, who writes that on Fergusson, is well- 
known for many engaging qualities which are here 
more apparent than are his equally well-known 
drawbacks as an editor. He has, too, a more en- 
couraging subject than has Mr. Bayne, who perhaps 
does all that is possible to make Thomson an inter- 
esting figure. Thomson was not an interesting man : 
he seems to have passed calmly through the life of 
a student at Edinburgh, and then, on emigrating to 
London, to have gradually gone through the life of 
a poet of the time, publishing poems and producing 
plays, supported by tutorship, patron, sinecure, and 
pension, with no greater incident than imprisonment 
for debt when ordinary sources of income failed. 
His poetry is not wholly uninteresting historic- 
ally it is very interesting ; but his life has but little 
in it to take up one's time nowadays. Fergusson, 
on the other hand, is still an interesting figure. 
Born almost in poverty, delicate in health, put to 
drudgery for a living, succumbing finally to mad- 
ness, and with all this a poet, he is a figure that 
arouses sympathy. An edition of Fergusson was 
one of Dr. Grosart's very early works; he has, 
therefore, peculiar opportunities which he makes 
good use of. He haa made a very interesting book ;

and though there may not be many (out of Scot- 
land) who will now care for Fergusson's poetry, 
there will be few who will read unmoved the story 
of Fergusson's life. All this is as it should be: 
Fergusson needed a biography ; most of us will be 
content with Thomson's poems. 

Under the title " Latin Literature of 
the Empire " (Harper), Dr. Alfred 
Gudeman, of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, has undertaken the presentation of char- 
acteristic selections from Roman writers of con- 
sequence, beginning with the elder Seneca and 
extending over a period of four centuries. The first 
volume, covering the prose writers of this period, 
is now before us. The works of fifteen authors are 
represented, the selections varying in quantity from 
about fifteen pages for some of the less important 
authors to seventy for Tacitus. Professor Gudeman 
is thoroughly acquainted with the literature of the 
imperial period, and his selections are made with due 
discrimination. If, after a hasty examination of the 
contents, we were asked to suggest anything which 
ought to have been included in his book and is not, it 
would be the crushing characterization of Tigellinus 
in the Annals of Tacitus. " Quo Vadis " is mentioned 
in the remarks introductory to the selections from 
Petronius ; it would perhaps have been well to show 
how much more effective Tacitus can be in clear-cut 
character-painting than Sienckiewicz. Mention of 
Petronius recalls the wording of Dr. Gudeman's 
opening sentence on this author : " The author of the 
Satirae is now generally identified with the elegantiae 
arbiter, or master of ceremonies, under Nero," etc. 
Did Dr. Gudeman intend this form of statement as 
shrewdly non-committal? We imagine that he did, 
as the identification rests on a very slender thread 
of argument, and he is inclined neither to accept 
weak arguments over-hastily, nor to give forth any 
uncertain sound when once he has reached a satis- 
factory conclusion. Students of Latin literature will 
thank Dr. Gudeman for this book. Most of the 
authors included are not frequently edited, and their 
works are difficult of access except in the vicinity 
of a few large libraries. At the same time, their 
works are valuable in themselves and necessary to 
any adequate view of the development of the Latin 
language and literature, as well as that of the subse- 
quent offshoots from this stem. Professor Gudeman's 
studies in this field have not blinded his eyes to 
" the relative inferiority of this literature as a whole 
when compared with the noonday splendor of that 
of the age which preceded it"; and it is to be hoped 
that the increasing tendency to study the authors 
of the silver age will not be allowed to contribute 
to the present tendency toward inferior standards in 
English. As a prophylactic against such a result, 
we advise a careful reading of Quintilian's famous 
passage on the younger Seneca, which may be found 
on pages 257-8 of the volume before us. We await 
with interest the second volume, which will be devoted 
to the poets. 



The French The J. B. Lippincott Co. publish in 

Revolution two sizable volumes entitled " The 

Reign of Terror" a miscellaneous 
collection of narratives of various eye-witnesses of 
the scenes that disgraced French humanity during 
the period of the ascendency in revolutionary France 
of the ultra-Jacobin factions. These extraordinary 
documents have been freely drawn on by the histor- 
ians, and students of the period will find in them much 
that is familiar. The narratives are interspersed 
with biographical notices and curious anecdotes, and 
the second volume is devoted mainly to memoirs 
describing life in the prisons. Readers with a taste 
for the horrible will find their account in these 
grewsome records. Read aright, they are not de- 
void of instruction. In them is writ large the lesson 
that a social order based on the ruthless oppression 
and degradation of society's toilers by a governing 
caste will go down in blood and ruin when the 
measure of its iniquity is full. What, essentially, 
was the French Revolution? It was the sudden 
and complete collapse of the long reign of a corrupt 
and enfeebled oligarchy that, after generations of 
misrule, fell in a day a prey to the vengeance of a 
populace it had educated in misery and crime. It 
used to be the fashion to point warningly to the 
excesses of the Terror as illustrating the way in 
which triumphant democracy might be expected to 
comport itself. But experience and calmer reflec- 
tion have long since shown the hollowness of this 
cheap reactionary cry. The blood shed by brutality 
at the bidding of fanaticism during the Reign of 
Terror was on the head of the old regime. The 
monsters that did that work were of its breeding. 
What the character of that work was, the present 
volumes sufficiently show. The edition is founded 
on the English one of 1826. There has been some 
judicious excision and compression, and an account 
of the maniacal proceedings at Nantes of that most 
infamous of the revolutionary proconsuls, Carrier, 
has been added. The work is passably edited by 
Messrs. P. Pinkerton and J. H. Ashworth. But 
the grotesque blunder in the old preface which 
places the number of the victims of the September 
massacres at " upwards of twelve thousand " should 
have been rectified. Twelve hundred is a rather high 
estimate. The volumes are presentably made, and 
contain two portraits the Princess de Lamballe 
and Beaumarchais. 



Wagner, his

his theatre. 



Professor Albert Lavignac, of the 
Paris Conservatoire, has written a

of Richard Wagner and his Festival Theatre in 
Bayreuth " ( Dodd ) which, although such a book 
upon such a subject would now seem to be a work 
of superogation, is hardly to be spared from the- 
music-lover's shelves. It provides " a real practical 
guide to Bayreuth," and, as such, is distinctly supe- 
rior to any other book with which we are acquainted.

bat instead two classes of facto, presented with the 
greatest particularity, neglecting nothing, however 
seemingly trivial, that either prospective pilgrim or 
visitor on the spot would wish to know. The first 
class of these facts includes details about reaching 
the musical Mecca of Bavaria, about employing the 
time when one is there, about the architecture of 
the Schauspielhaus, about the arrangement of mu- 
sicians and spectators, about the dates and casts of 
all the performances thus far given, and about the 
external history of the Wagnerian dramas, including 
the biography of the composer. This section of the 
work is illustrated by photographs and diagrams. 
The second class of facto includes all those apper- 
taining to the dramas considered as works of art ; 
that is, act-by-act analyses of the texts, charts giving 
the order of entrance of the characters, catalogues 
of the Leitmotive with copious illustrations in mu- 
sical notation, and diagrams showing the appear- 
ance of each motive in each act and scene of all the 
dramas. These are some, but by no means all, of 
the details provided by this remarkable work. We 
have said that the author eschews aestheticiam in 
his descriptions, but this does not mean that they 
are devoid of the critical element. On the contrary, 
they are compact with criticism, sympathetic but 
sane, and we are quite as much attracted by M. 
Lavignac's lucidity of style and sobriety of judg- 
ment as by the astonishing array of facto which he 
provides. For the book is by no means a dry com- 
pendium, but for the most part a readable and ex- 
tremely interesting essay in interpretation, such 
a book, in short, as we have long wished for, but 
have hitherto despaired of possessing. 

A im>g-ra*ge ^ ' ne " certain condescension " no- 
criiic of our ticeable in Americans who have lived 

long abroad is apparent in the pages 
of Mr. Eliot Gregory's "Worldly Ways and Byways" 
(Scribner), the tone is still one of sympathy with the 
cruder forms of American life, rather than of mere 
tolerance. Being judged by one of ourselves, instead 
of by foreigners, has this advantage : that the sayings 
and doings of immigrants and their immediate pro- 
geny are not taken to be the manifestations of our 
national life, with the corollary that the criticisms 
offered by the essayist are directed at those who may 
heed them the Americans of old descent The 
sense of aloofness which Mr. Gregory's European 
education has given him is heightened by the fact, 
which he makes evident, of his enjoying the " best " 
society in New York City. This furnishes him with 
the point of view of an aristocrat, and enables him 
to discourse upon the evils of discontent in our mode 
of living, meaning, apparently, the failure of his 
countrymen to keep themselves duly arranged in social 
strata for generation after generation, in accordance 
with the more stable institutions of Europe. Every 
American who has progressed far enough along the 
social ladder to dwell in a household with a " hired 
girl " has felt the same thing, in all probability. 
Some of us have tempered the acerbities of the situa- 



tion by trying to view it with the eyes of the employed. 
But the wisest look forward to the day when the 
American genius for mechanics shall have given up 
an automatic servant, rather than to the establish- 
ment of caste. Mr. Gregory's comments are fair in 
the main, making allowances for his early advan- 
tages, and are certainly pertinent and interesting. 
Still, we cannot quite look forward to ourselves as 
a nation of Gregories.

Old English Town," by Mary Dormer Harris, the 
slow development of a community founded a short 
time before the Norman Conquest is placed before 
the reader panoramic-ally, showing the successive 
struggles of the church, the burghers, and the robber 
barons to obtain control of the taxing power. There 
are more centuries in the age of Coventry than 
there are decades in the existence of Chicago ; and 
the latter, for all that it has never had any religious 
questions to solve, is not much further along in 
commanding its own resources than Coventry was 
during the Wars of the Roses. In both cases the 
struggle is a desperate one, the shrewd intelligence 
of greed arraying itself against the diffused interest 
of sleepy or preoccupied citizens, who fairly refuse 
to arouse themselves until thrust forcibly from their 
very beds of ease. Coventry to-day is governed in 
a manner which may well be emulated. And there 
are episodes in its history, such as the use its inhab- 
itants made of their periods of prosperity for the 
erection of notable public buildings, which are no 
less exemplary. The work is done with a pains-

of Sophocles, ./Escbylus, and Euripides, of the influ- 
ences of the work of architects, sculptors, and paint- 
ers about them, such a research as might be made 
(comparing great things with small) for Maeterlinck 
and the Pre-Raphaelites and symbolists of England 
and France. So far, the essayist's purpose is clear. 
But there is another and deeper matter beneath, 
which makes the essay also one upon the inter- 
relations of the fine arts during Athens' glory, and 
gives it an interest hardly less catholic than special. 
As a whole, the book is a flattering example of the 
work American scholars are doing in the worthiest 
directions.

Bismarck and 
German Unity. 



We thought when we read Professor 
Munroe Smith's sketch of Bismarck 
in the New York "Nation," some 
weeks ago, that it was about as good a thing in its 
way as we had ever seen ; and after re-reading it 
we put it carefully away for future reference. This 
admirable historical outline has now been issued by 
the Macmillan Co. in book form under the title of 
" Bismarck and German Unity." The volume is a 
comely one of about a hundred pages, and it con- 
tains a capital frontispiece portrait of its hero. We 
heartily recommend this little book as a royal road 
to a clear general understanding of Bismarck and 
his work. 

Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer, by 
dint of patient ransacking of various 
collections of old family papers, has 
managed to piece together a rather readable pic- 
ture of old Dutch and English-Dutch colonial home 
life, which she entitles " The Goede Vrouw of Mana- 
ha-ta, 1609-1760" (Scribner). Hitherto unex- 
ploited family papers furnish the basis of the book, 
but the authorities have not been neglected. As 
Mrs. Van Rensselaer's title implies, it is with the 
ways and doings of the matrons of Manhattan, 
rather than of their spouses, that her book is prin- 
cipally concerned ; and this theme is naturally one 
which strongly enlists her sympathies. The book is 
of a type rather common of late years, and it is a 
favorable specimen of its class.

know where to find the essentials of English history more

title of the present volume is something of a misnomer, 
for the period it really covers is 1327 1485, the period 
between the accession of Edward II. and the Tudor

Mifflin, & Co., is uniform with the other single-volume 
poets issued under that designation, and has the usual 
portrait, biography, and notes. The text extends to 
nearly nine hundred double-column pages, and has been 
printed with scrupulous care. We miss from this edition 
" The Foresters " and the " Death of CEnone " volume, 
presumably for copyright reasons, but we get, per contra, 
the early poems omitted by Tennyson in the later issues 
of his verse. Praise of the work, considering the auspices 
under which it appears, would be superfluous. 

Mr. J. Scott Clark has prepared " A Study of English 
Prose Writers," which is published by the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner. The work is described as " a laboratory method." 
Twenty-six writers, from Bacon to O. W. Holmes, are 



made the subjects of as many chapters. In each case 
we have a biography, a bibliography, and a selection of 
critical opinions with accompanying illustrations. It is 
in the classification of this latter material that the most 
distinctive feature of the work is to be sought. The 
work seems to us a very useful one, and we commend 
it strongly to teachers of English, hoping at the same 
time that its success will be such as to encourage the 
author to proceed with his plan of two similar volumes 
to be devoted mainly to the poets. 

" A History of English Critical Terms " (Heath), by 
Mr. J. W. Bray, purports " to trace the changes of mean- 
ing which have taken place in the chief terms employed 
in English criticism. About fourteen hundred critical 
epithets are given in alphabetical order, and, according 
to their importance, are illustrated by quotations. Many 
of the entries are single lines, such as " Ostentation : 
B. Jon. to present." A few have pages of illustrative 
passages. An appendix attempts a somewhat labored 
philosophical classification of the terms indexed. The 
work embodies an excellent idea, and is useful as far 
as it goes, but the author's reading does not seem to have 
been as extensive as it should have been. We miss many 
of the most characteristic terms of recent criticism, such 
as Arnold's " Corinthian " and Pater's " indefectible," 
and we doubt if many of those given have been traced 
as far back as possible. 

The second volume of " Operative Gynecology," by 
Dr. Howard A. Kelly, of the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, has just been issued by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 
A general notice of the work was given in our issue 
of May 1 last, on the appearance of Volume I. The 
present volume contains 570 large octavo pages, with 
more than six hundred original illustrations, twenty-four 
of them colored plates. There is a notable chapter on 
conservative operations, in which this eminent specialist 
has done much to relieve this branch of surgery from 
some perhaps not undue reproach ; and humanity would 
doubtless be the gainer if the chapter could be read by 
every member, and particularly every young member, 
of the medical profession. 

The Snake-Dance of the Moki Indians of Arizona 
attracts greater attention each year. It is the most 
striking and startling native ceremonial still celebrated 
in our country. Never celebrated two years in succes- 
sion at any one pueblo, it occurs in alternating years at 
Oraibe and Wolpi. This year it was held at Oraibe; 
next year it will be seen at Wolpi. Mr. Walter Hough, 
of the United States National Museum, describes the 
dance and pueblo life in Arizona in a pretty little book, 
" The Moki Snake-Dance " just published by the Santa 
Fe Railroad. The plan of the book and the selection of 
the sixty-four illustrations it contains were the work of 
Mr. Charles A. Higgins. Both in a literary and an 
artistic way the book is good, and deserves careful 
reading and a place in the library alongside of the 
standard works on such subjects. 

Recent modern language text- books include the follow- 
ing: Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a " Grammaire 
Franchise," by Messrs. Baptiste Mdras and S. M. Stern; 
TOpffer's " La Bibliotheque de Mon Oncle," edited by 
Mr. Robert L. Taylor; and Richard von Volkmann- 
Leander's " Traumereien an Franzosischen Kaminen," 
edited by Miss Idelle B. Watson. The Macmillan Co. 
publish Lessing's " Nathan der Weise," edited by Mr. 
George O. Curme; and Goethe's "Egmont," edited by 
Dr. Sylvester Primer.

[Nov. 16, 



KM; KISII CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, November S, 1898. 

Mr. Harold Frederic's death baa been the talk of the 
town, and his friends are entirely at a loss to under- 
stand how he could have been brought to take up with 
this so-called " Christian Science." I am afraid the 
connection, coupled with the revelations which have 
been made at the inquest, will not tend to increase his 
popularity, with the British public, at any rate. He 
leaves two wives and two families, and his will portions 
put his property between them. Not that his interests 
in the copyrights can be worth much; for I am told the 
English interests had already been largely drawn upon 
while he was yet alive. He was a gifted man, without 
a doubt, and seems to have had the happy faculty of 
drawing to himself the best in his friends. 

The death of Mr. Gleeson White makes another, if 
less important, void in the ranks of journalists. He did 
not achieve any very arresting work in literature, for 
his life was too much taken up with other matters. He 
will be best remembered as the founder and first editor 
of M The Studio," and for the charm of his gracious per- 
sonality. I have never known any man so generous, so 
unselfish, or so ready to help others. His wit and con- 
versation made it a delight to be in his society. But his 
career will be chiefly valued and appreciated by the 
many young fellows who found in him the quick-hearted 
friend and earnest adviser. I do not think that he 
would ever have made a great name in literature, in 
whatever circumstances he was placed. Creative activ- 
ity is the possession of but very few. But he had the 
rare nature which influences others by its own magic of 
tenderness, graciousness, and kindly encouragement. 
The world at large may soon forget him; but the mem- 
ory of Gleeson White will always remain enshrined in 
the hearts of his friends. 

I mentioned, some weeks ago, that Mr. Harry Quilter 
was about to commence business as a publisher. His 
first " announcement " is just made. It is not new, by 
any means, for there have been illustrated editions be- 
fore of Browning's " Pied Piper of Hamelin." What is 
new is that the publisher himself should be the illustra- 
tor. He calls the volume an edition de luxe." As 
the price of four hundred out of the five hundred copies 
to be issued is to be about twenty-five dollars, and fifty 
dollars for the remaining hundred, one expects some- 
thing in the way of luxury. In addition to many spe- 
cially designed ornaments and borders, the volume is 
to contain twenty-seven full-page miniatures, and two 
color plates, as the circular has it, "on English vellum 
and silk." It is to be whole bound, with original de- 
sign in gold, and inlaid with embossed silver plates." 
This is luxurious publishing, with a vengeance f 

You will, no doubt, have heard that Mr. John Morley 
is to be the biographer of Mr. Gladstone, and that 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co. are to publish the biography 
in England and America. Mr. Morley seems determined 
to do anything rather than finish his life of Chatham 
which has been promised for the "Twelve English 
Statesmen " series for the past ten years. Perhaps, like 
Huxley's Berkeley," it will never be published. 

I was right in my figures as to the price paid for the 
Bismarck Memoirs. The 6000 is for England alone, 
and Messrs. Harper & Brothers have paid a similar sum 
for the American rights. 

The Esterhazy book is to appear in Paris on the 20th 
of this month, but it will be a first instalment only. 



Efforts are being made to publish the work in England 
at the same time. It is to be a volume of some three or 
four hundred pages, giving the complete history of 
" L'Affaire Dreyfus." For the story of his own personal 
connection with this business, M. Esterhazy will have 
another volume. 

The American method of selling long " sets "of books 
by means of the instalment payment system, so success- 
fully adopted by the " Times " for the " Encyclopaedia 
Britannica," will, in all probability, have great vogue 
here. Already Messrs. Macmillan & Co. offer their 
illustrated edition of Green's " Short History of the 
English People " on these terms. Messrs. Pearson & 
Co. lately announced that they would sell a complete 
edition in twenty-five volumes of the novels of Sir Walter 
Scott by a payment of 5. down and instalments of 1*. per 
week. The applications they received were so numerous 
that they cannot supply orders. Messrs. Downey & Co. 
are following out the same principle with the Wormeley 
edition of Balzac's " Come'die Humaine." 

An important work on Russia, its development and 
relations with Eastern and Western nations, both politi- 
cally and commercially, is to be published next spring. 
It is from the press of Mr. Alexis Krausse, and will be 
published here by Mr. Grant Richards. The book 
ought to appeal to American readers; but I have not 
heard that any American house has, as yet, acquired the 
right of publishing it. 

Mr. G. Bernard Shaw has passed for the press the 
last sheets of " The Perfect Wagnerite," which is to be 
published on your side by Mr. H. S. Stone. The book 
will form an exposition of Wagner's musical treatment 
of the fable of The Ring," and is written in Mr. Shaw's 
characteristic manner. TEMPLE SCOTT. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a pretty volume 
of selections from Southey's " Doctor " and other mis- 
cellaneous writings in the lighter vein. 

Sir Henry Thompson's " Food and Feeding " is reis- 
sued by Messrs. Frederic Warne & Co. in a new edition 
(the ninth), revised and much enlarged. 

The Messrs. Scribner have just published " The 
Shaving of Shagpat " and " The Tragic Comedians " in 
their new edition of Mr. Meredith's novels. 

" The Market- Place," the novel left in manuscript by 
the late Harold Frederic, will be published as a serial 
in the Saturday Evening Post " of Philadelphia. 

" The Fortunes of Nigel," in two dainty volumes, is 
the latest addition to the " Temple " edition of Scott's 
novels. The Messrs. Scribner are the American pub- 
lishers. 

Mr. William Blaikie's " How to Get Strong and How 
to Stay So " is reissued by the Messrs. Harper, after 
nearly twenty years of popular favor, in a revised edi- 
tion printed from new plates. 

A recent publication of the Field Columbian Museum 
a a monograph on the " Ruins of Xkichmook, Yucatan," 
by Mr. Edward H. Thompson. The pamphlet is a thin 
one, but it is richly illustrated by photographic plates 
of great interest. 

" The Novel and the Drama " will be the subject of 
;be address that Mr. Hall Caine is to deliver before the 
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago on the twenty- 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

fourth of this month. In view of the dual form that 
Mr. Caine has given to " The Christian," and the wide- 
spread discussion excited thereby, this address is likely 
to attract much attention. 

How much better it is to preach in sermons than in 
fiction, the republication of Dr. Henry Van Dyke's 
" Ships and Havens " serves to accent. The essay is 
a charming one, and the publisher (Crowell) has given 
it a setting worthy of its beauties. 

Two valuable little volumes in the " Ladies' Home 
Journal Household Library," published by the Doubleday 
& McClure Co., are "Model Houses for Little Money," 
by Mr. William L. Price, and " Inside of One Hundred 
Homes," by Mr. William M. Johnson. Both are exten- 
sively illustrated. 

" The Arabian Nights " and " Robinson Crusoe " are 
two most acceptable additions to the " Illustrated En- 
glish Library," imported by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. Mr. Fred. Pegram and Mr. C. H. Brock are the 
respective illustrators of the volumes, and the work of 
each is unusually good. 

Mr. R. L. Paget has prepared a collection of " Poems 
of American Patriotism " which is now published by 
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. The special purpose of the 
editor seems to have been to bring together the lyrical 
outpourings occasioned by our three months' war with 
Spain, for nearly half of the value is devoted to these 
precious effusions. Most of them seem to have been 
written for the newspapers, and should never have got 
into a book. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co., in connection with Mr. T. 
Fisher Unwin of London, is putting forth a popular re- 
issue of " The Adventure Series," a collection of histor- 
ical memoirs and narratives that enjoyed much vogue 
six or eight years ago. The first seven volumes have 
already appeared, and a dozen more are soon to follow. 
As in the original enterprise, so in this republication, 
Trelawny's " Adventures of a Younger Son " leads 
bravely off, and whets the appetite for the books that 
are to come after. 

Mr. E. A. Vizetelly, writing to " The Athenaeum," 
makes some interesting statements about " M. Zola's 
next books." He says: "M. Zola has two books in 
hand : in the first place, one entitled ' Fe'condite', 1 which 
will be the first of a series of four novels following the 
trilogy of ' Lourdes,' Rome,' and Paris.' The second 
volume will be called ' Travail,' the third ' Ve'rite',' and 
the fourth ' Justice.' The ' heroes ' of these works 
will be the four sons of M. Zola's Abbe* Froment, and, 
beyond a similarity of names, they will have nothing in 
common with the Biblical Evangelists. The books 
themselves will be as much novels as, say, any volumes 
of the Rougon-Macquart series; but they will reflect 
the four essential points of M. Zola's own belief. With 
regard to L' Affaire Dreyfus,' M. Zola certainly intends 
to write a book on it in due season, and has made many 
notes with that object; but he has never shirked criti- 
cism, and whatever he may write he hopes to have pub- 
lished, not after his death, but during his lifetime. 
However, the end of 'L'Affaire Dreyfus' is not yet; 
whether it will ever come is a proposition not unworthy 
of argument. And meantime between the chapters of 
1 Fe'condite' ' M. Zola has been preparing an account of 
his adventures, experiences, and observations in exile. 
This will be copiously illustrated from photographs and 
sketches; but inasmuch as it is still impossible to say 
when M. Zola's exile will cease, no date can be fixed 
fpr its publication,"

" On Fame's eternal camping-ground 

Their silent tents are spread, 
And Glory guards with solemn round 
The bivouac of the dead." 

Theodore O'Hara's masterpiece, in which the fore- 
going lines appear, is the subject of this ably written 
book. The whole story of the poem is given, with 
a biography of the soldier-poet, compiled from family 
papers. 

This well-known lyric was a favorite of Grant, 
Lee, and Gladstone, and it has been styled "the 
finest martial elegy in existence." Mr. Ranck has 
scored as complete a success in this as in the field of 
history.

Professor Francke's letters to The Nation, The Bookman, and other journals, which form the basis of the volume, attracted 
great attention, and have been found worthy of preservation in a permanent form. No other recent comment upon the con- 
dition of German life and letters has been so fresh, so informing, and so useful.

12mo, cloth $1.50 

The famous novel written by Petronius Arbiter in the reign of Nero is the only surviving specimen of the realistic fiction 

of classical antiquity. " Trimalchio's Dinner" is the one episode of the book that is complete in itself, and this has been 

translated by Professor Peck with idiomatic freedom, so as to bring out in modern dress the easy chat, the colloquialisms, and 

the slang of the original.

Harold Frederic's Greatest Books 

GLORIA MUNDI 
THE DAMNATION OF THERON WARE 

The death of Mr. Frederic has called forth the unanimous praise of the critics for his work. 
" Theron Ware," or " Illumination " as it was called in England, is ranked among the few really 
great American novels. " Gloria Mundi " is Mr. Frederic's first serious work since this great 
success. It occupied his attention almost until the day of his death, and therefore represents 
his latest effort. Three large editions were sold before publication. The two books, 12 mo. 
Cloth, $1.50 each. 

THE MONEY CAPTAIN. 

A novel. By WILL PAYNE. With "Jerry the Dreamer " 
Mr. Payne was first brought before the public. His present 
book treats of the government of our cities by large private 
corporations. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 



IN THE CAGE. 

By HENRY JAMES. 

" We could not wish for a better representation of the art of Henry 
James." Academy. 
12mo, cloth. Uniform with " What Maisie Knew." $1.25. 

A SLAVE TO DUTY, and Other Women. 

By OCTAVE THANET. Miss French has such a thoroughly 
established reputation among the present reading public that 
no introduction to this collection of short stories will be nec- 
essary. 16mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

THE BORDERLAND OF SOCIETY. 

By CHARLES BELMONT DAVIS. Mr. Davis comes of a liter- 
ary family, being a brother of Richard Harding Davis and a 
son of Rebecca Harding Davis. This is his first book. 16mo. 
Cloth, illustrated, $1.25. 

A GOLDEN SORROW. 

By MARIA LOUISE POOL. This novel was running serially 
in GWej/'s Magazine at the time of Miss Pool's death. It was 
not, however, completed in that periodical, but was issued at 
once in book form. It is a story of love and adventure in 
St. Augustine, much more exciting than Miss Pool's stories 
usually are, but with all her delightful sense of humor. 12mo. 
Cloth, $1.50. 

THE JEW, THE GYPSY, AND EL ISLAM. 

By the late Sir RICHARD F. BURTON, K.C.M.G., F.R.Q.S., 
etc. Edited, with a preface and brief notes, by W. H. WIL- 
KINS, author of " The Romance of Isabel Lady Burton." In 
large 8vo. Cloth, with photogravure portrait of the author 
from picture by the late Lord Leighton. $3.50 net. 

THE PALMY DAYS OF NANCE OLDFIELD. 

By EDWARD ROBINS. It has been Mr. Robins' aim to give 
a faithful presentment not only of the famous and fascinating 
actress herself, but of her whole environment also. Thus all 
the theatrical and much of the literary life of the period come 
within the purview of his book ; and Steele and Addison, 
Booth and Gibber, are among the many celebrities who figure 
in its pages. Much curious information is given regarding the 
relations of actors and managers, while special interest attaches 
to the description of some of the most notable performances 
in which Mrs. Oldfield took part. 8vo. Cloth, with 12 illus- 
trations, $3.50 net. 

SUCCESSFUL HOUSES. 

By OLIVER COLEMAN. Every room in the house is taken 
up in the book and methods of treatment suggested. Mr. 
Coleman's articles have been widely read in The House Beau- 
tiful, and it is safe to say that no book on Interior Decoration 
has ever been published which is so practical and so com- 
pletely governed by the requirements of good taste. Many 
half-tone illustrations of interiors accompany the text. 8vo. 
Cloth, finely illustrated, $1.50.

"This story seems to me the strongest and sincerest bit of fiction I

HOW TO PLAY GOLF. 

By H. J. WHIGHAM. New edition. With a chapter on the 
play at the amateur tournament of 1898. 12mo. Cloth, with 
eighty illustrations, $1.50. 

CHAP-BOOK STORIES. 

This is the second collection of the best short stories from 
the Chap-Book. Many well-known names are included in the 
table of contents, and the volume will undoubtedly meet with 
the success which was accorded to the first volume of the 
series on its appearance two years ago. Second series. 16mo. 
Cloth, $1.25. 

THE NEW ECONOMY. 

A peaceful solution of the social problem. By LAURENCE 
GRONLUND, A.M., author of " The Cooperative Common- 
wealth," etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

CATHERINE SFORZA: A Study. 

By Count PASOLINI. Adapted from the Italian by PAUL 
SYLVESTER. Count Pasolini is a lineal descendant of the 
hereditary enemies of the Sf orza family. His work is enriched 
by numerous illustrations, facsimiles of handwriting, seals, 
and quotations from some five hundred letters of the Madonna 
of Furli. It combines the charm of romance with the dignity 
of history, and brings within the reader's ken, not only the 
militant princess who held the Fort of St. Angelo against the 
Conclave (thus arresting the affairs of Europe until her own 
were settled), who circumvented Machiavelli and defied Cesar 
Borgia, but the private woman in her court and home, her 
domestic and social relations. 8vo. Cloth, with many illus- 
trations, $3.50 net. 

THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR. 

By EYE WITNESSES. This volume represents something 
entirely new in historical writing. Every incident of the 
present war is vividly described by some one who was actually 
on the ground, and can, therefore, write accurately about 
what occurred. The illustrations are not on the order of the 
many " War Portfolios," but are taken from photographs 
actually snapped in the field and on the battleships. 8vo. 
Cloth, nearly two hundred illustrations, $1.50.

HARPER'S NEW PUBLICATIONS 

BISMARCK'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY 

BISMARCK, THE MAN AND THE STATESMAN : Being the Reflections and Reminiscences 
of Otto Prince von Bismarck Written and Dictated by Himself after his Retirement from 
Office. Translated from the German under the supervision of A. W. Butler, late Fellow 
of Trinity College, Cambridge. Two Volumes, 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops. 
About 750 pages. 17.50. 

The (S>rt>anken UtltJ lEtinnEtUlUjen of Prince Bismarck were written and prepared by himself. It will be, 
therefore, the only authoritative biography of the Iron Chancellor, who stamped his personality upon the 
politics of Europe for more than half a century during the most important years of Central European history. 
These Reminiscences constitute not alone the autobiography of a great statesman, but the most important con- 
tribution to historical literature in the last quarter of a century. The publication of these Memoirs is an in- 
ternational event of importance. The book appears simultaneously from the house of Cotta in Germany, from 
Smith, Elder & Co. in England, and in New York from HARPER & BROTHERS. 

THROUGH ASIA 

By SVEN HEDIN. With Two Maps and Two Plates Printed in Colors and about 280 Illus- 
trations by the Author and from Photographs. About 1300 pages. Two Volumes, 
Large 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops. 110.00. 

Dr. Hedin left his native city of Stockholm in 1893, and from that time until, in 1897, his task was 
accomplished by entering Peking, he was engaged constantly in a desperate struggle with the tremendous diffi- 
culties which beset his way. His successful passage through Pamir, where progress became a ceaseless battle 
against snow and ice and cold, and where often the only method of advancing was upon hands and knees ; the 
thrilling ascent of the " Father of all Ice Mountains," Mus-tagh-ata; his terrible fight against thirst and exhaus- 
tion in the desert of Tak-la-makan all these go to make up an almost unparalleled story of human daring, 
suffering, and endurance. 

IN THE FORBIDDEN LAND 

An Account of a Journey into Tibet, Capture by the Tibetan Lamas and Soldiers, Impris- 
onment, Torture, and Ultimate Release, brought about by Dr. Wilson and the Political 
Peshkar Karak Sing-Pal. By A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR. With the Government 
Enquiry and Report and other Official Documents, by J. LARKIN, Esq., Deputed by the 
Government of India. With One Photogravure, Eight Colored Plates, Fifty Full-page 
and about One Hundred and Fifty Text Illustrations, and a Map from Surveys by the 
Author. Two Volumes, 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops. $9.00. 
Mr. A. H. Savage Landor's book on his Tibetan journey gives blood-curdling descriptions of the tortures 
which he suffered at the hands of the Lamas. When he was taken prisoner the Pombo, a high Lama and the 
Governor of the province, caused him to be placed on a pony with a spiked saddle, and in this excruciating 
position he was made to ride a long distance, while shot and arrows were discharged at him, though happily 
without effect N. Y. Tribune.

Nelson's New Series of Teachers' Bibles. 

NEW ILLUSTRATIONS NEW CONCORDANCE 

NEW HELPS NEW MAPS 

These Teachers' Bibles contain " THE ILLUSTRATED BIBLE TREASURY," written by leading 
Bible Scholars in America and Great Britain, a new Indexed Bible Atlas, 

UPWARDS OF 350 ILLUSTRATIONS 

of Ancient Monuments, Scenes in Bible Lands, Animals, Plants, Antiquities, Coins, etc., distri- 
buted through the text of the Helps, and a New Concordance to the Authorized and Revised 
Versions, combined with a Subject-Index and Pronouncing Dictionary of Scripture Proper Names. 

THE SUNDAY SCHOOL TIMES, September 17, 1898, says : The Nelson Teachers' 
Bible is of high grade. The Illustrated Bible Treasury is a collection of helps, more full than 
most others, and showing great care in preparation. For example, any one who will compare 
its treatment of the geography, the topography, the astronomy, zoology, mineralogy, botany, 
or the antiquities of the Bible with similar matter to be found anywhere else, will find the 
comparison greatly to the credit of this Bible. There are about three hundred and fifty 
illustrations. The Concordance, Subject-Index, and Pronouncing Dictionary of Proper Names, 
are combined under one alphabet. . . . Another especial excellence is that its Concordance 
covers the Revised Version as well as the Old Version." 

THE DIAL says : " . . . . The wealth of illustrations of the best sort not old worn- 
out cuts adds greatly to the beauty and completeness of the articles. The natural-history 
sections are especially fine in matter and make-up. The Concordance is the most complete 
yet produced, being adapted both to the Authorized and to the Revised Versions, and con- 
taining also proper names. We also find incorporated in it several themes which, in other 
' Helps,' are found merely in separate sections under the dry, uninteresting form of tables. . . . 
Is nearest the ideal Bible student's manual of any publication in its field." 

THE CHRISTIAN INTELLIGENCER says :".... It has no superior. ... The 
best series of * Helps ' in existence. It is, indeed, a * Treasury,' filled with pearls of great price." 

PRICES FROM $1.25 TO $7.00.

Beautiful Art Edition of the New Testament. 

Long Primer square 16mo, profusely embellished. 

With Two Hundred Illustrations of Bible Scenes and Sites from Photographs by Bonfils, Thevos, 

Mason Good, and others distributed throughout the text. 

" The illustrations are not reproductions of paintings, which so often misrepresent the actual scenes, and which 
are, indeed, often extremely fanciful and misleading, but for the most part half-tones or (in a few instances) 
engravings from photographs of all important localities referred to in the sacred narrative. Thus the real scene , 
as it exists at present, is brought vividly before the eye of the reader. . . . The book is printed in large, clear 
type, and handsomely bound in leather." The Examiner.

CARTOONS OF OUR WAR 
WITH SPAIN 

By CM. NELAN, of the New York Herald. 

The most interesting and successful cartoons published

were humorous, but yet dignified, and they won for Mr. 
Nelan at once a position as one of the leading cartoonists of 
the world. 

There are over fifty of these pictures and they have a ser- 
ious value, as they tell practically the history of the war in a 
vivid and most fascinating way. The size of the page, 
9y z x 11 inches, the fine paper and excellent presswork, bring 
out all the merit of Mr. N elan's pen-and-ink sketches.

THE REVIVAL OF ROMANCE. 

An attentive reader of the last issue of THE 
DIAL must have noticed the fact that no less 
than three of the chief contributions to that 
issue frankly espouse the cause of romance as 
against the claims that have been put forward 
so strenuously of recent years in behalf of 
realism. This conjunction of opinion was 
purely fortuitous and unpremeditated, and may 
for that reason be taken as a really significant 
sign of the times. When the critic wrote of 
Cyrano de Bergerac as a heroic figure pre- 
sented "to a world which is all ready to enjoy 
romance once more " ; when the essayist sought 
to analyze "the ordinary and the common- 
place to see why they fail to afford materials 
for great art," and concluded by saying that 
he could not " conceive of anything more use- 
less than a literature which reproduces life 
without a background of thought and imagi- 



388 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



nation " ; when the poet personified triumphant 
Romance returning to her own, and saying : 

" Since of the oldest dynasty am I, 
Delight of life within my gift doth lie ; 
The heart of man, of woman, and of child, 
Without me were to fate unreconciled. 
A space hath Human Fashion banished me ; 
Bnt Human Fashion will soon wearied be ! 
I only wait the unfed heart's recall. 
To take my place my place supreme in all." 

All three, critic, essayist, and poet alike, were 
expressing, each in his own language, essen- 
tially the same truth, the truth that Art must 
better Nature and transcend it unless it is 
prepared to abdicate its ancient empire. 

The new romanticism, as was also pointed 
out by at least one of these writers, is not quite 
the same thing as the old, for it has learned 
something from the rival by which it has been 
for a time supplanted. What it has learned is 
the Shakespearian lesson that 

" Nature is made better by no mean, 
Bnt Nature makes that mean: so, o'er that art, 
Which, yon say, adds to Nature, is an art 
That Nature makes . . . This is an art 
Which does mend Nature change it rather : but 
The art itself is Nature." 

When we speak of the prospective or accom- 
plished revival of romance, we do not mean 
the sort of the thing that satisfied the eight- 
eenth century. " The Castle of Otranto," and 
" Melmoth the Wanderer," will hardly serve 
as prototypes of the new product atavism 
cannot go as far as that but the romanticism 
that is now carrying literature before it is a 
form of art that, like the giant of Greek fable, 
gains renewed strength from contact with the 
earth. The romancer is no longer privileged 
to live in the clouds, or to dispense with the 
probabilities, but he is nevertheless constrained 
to idealize and ennoble those aspects of life 
with which he is concerned, and to view them, 
not with the scientist, through a microscope, 
but with the philosopher, sub specie ceternitatis. 
The terms realism and romanticism have 
been so bandied about in critical discussion, 
have been made so hackneyed by indiscriminate 
use, that we hesitate to drag them forth once 
more from their decent veteran retirement. 
And, as we have frequently maintained, they 
almost wholly lose their special signification 
when we seek to apply them to literature of the 
first order. It is the shallowest sort of criticism 
that will be content to label the " Inferno " as 
realistic and * Hamlet " as romantic. Where, 
as in the case of the world-masterpieces, we are 
in the presence of the sheerest Vision, the tint 
of the glasses and the index of their refraction 
become matters of small importance. It is only 



upon a lower plane of literature that the distinc- 
tion between realism and romanticism actually 
exists ; it is a distinction hardly to be made, for 
example, between Scott and Balzac, or between 
Tourgue'nieff and Hawthorne; but it may prop- 
erly be drawn in a discussion of Stevenson and 
Mr. Gissing, or of Mr. Black and Mr. Howells. 
It is a distinction that exists only because of 
a one-sided development or a defective artistic 
endowment. 

It seems to us that the signs are multiplying 
upon every hand to show that the star of this 
narrower realism is waning, and that the world 
is once more coming to its own in the ideal 
realms of the imagination. Indeed, when we 
think of the other arts, of painting and music 
for example, the sort of thing that we are accus- 
tomed to call realism appears as a belated par- 
allel of the work that found favor in those arts 
a generation or more ago. It illustrates merely 
an iiberwundener Standpunkt. When we think 
how far painting has got beyond Frith and the 
" Derby Day," when we reflect upon the full 
meaning of the Wagnerian triumph, we may 
with small difficulty, if we are anything of 
a prophet, foresee the time when men shall look 
back upon the petty realism of the past score 
of years with mild wonder at the thought that 
it should ever have been taken so seriously, with 
no other feeling than the curious interest that 
we bring to the contemplation of such passing 
vagaries of thought and taste as the history of 
civilization reveals by the score. The aim of art 
always has been, and always must be, to get 
away from the details of life and to " overhear " 
its essential expression, to arrange ideal catego- 
ries for familiar facts, to make them symmet- 
rical, to classify, and, beyond all else, to exclude. 

What are some of the signs that realism has 
not " come to stay " in our imaginative litera- 
ture? It may seem as if M. Zola had the 
" cry " just now in France, but this is the 
most superficial view imaginable. He has 
notoriety enough, no doubt, but the sources 
whence it springs will be dried up in a few 
years, and then the bulk of his work will sink 
out of sight by its own specific gravity. Who 
ever wanted to read " L'Assommoir " or " La 
Debacle " a second time, except from some 
motive secondary to that of the satisfaction 
that their first reading gave? But we re- 
cur with delight to Hugo and Dumas and 
George Sand, and no custom can stale their 
infinite variety. Why have Mr. Sienkiewicz 
and Signor d'Annunzio achieved lasting repu- 
tations in their respective countries? The

former has done it by the pure romanticism of 
his genius, and the latter in spite, not because, 
of his over-insistence upon sordid facts. Why 
are "Johannes" and " Hannele " and "Die 
Versunkene Glocke " the most striking things 
in recent German literature ? Simply because 
they strike the note of idealism once more. 
Why are the careers of Herr Bjornsen and Dr. 
Ibsen so illuminative for our thesis ? Because 
each of these great men presents in epitome 
the artistic experience of the generation. That 
is, because each of them began his work in 
the purest romantic spirit, was for a time led 
astray into the morass of realism, and is now 
groping his way back to the sunlit meadows 
of idealism. And because the former of these 
men never got so far from the true path as 
did the other, the totality of his work will, in 
the final estimate, be held the greater and 
more enduring. 

In England and America the swing of the 
pendulum toward romanticism is equally evi- 
dent. The exceptional delicacy and charm of 
their workmanship is all that keeps us reading 
the successive productions of Mr. Howells and 
Mr. James. They no longer produce any kind 
of a thrill ; the force by which they once pro- 
duced it is spent. In the work of Mr. Mere- 
dith and Mr. Hardy the elements are so mixed 
that a definite classification is difficult, yet 
when we reflect upon what we best remember 
in such books as " Richard Feverel " and 
" Jude the Obscure," it is easy to conclude that 
their authors are most effective when least 
realistic. In our more popular fiction, every 
form of romance is illustrated. There is the 
emotional romance of "The Christian," the 
fantastic romance of the " Zenda " books, the 
mystical romance of " Aylwin," and the his- 
torical romance of " The Seats of the Mighty." 
Other examples, equally typical, might be ad- 
duced by the score. Such are the books that 
the public delights to read, and their produc- 
tion is coming to outnumber overwhelmingly 
all the other kinds of story-books. The ro- 
mantic revival is at full tide, and contemporary 
literature bids fair to offer us once more the 
solace that it brought us of old. We have 
learned that it is extremely foolish to insist of 
a writer that he give us all the facts connected 
with his theme. We have learned the limita- 
tions of literary photography, we have learned 
that it is unwise to approach literature bur- 
dened with a sense of responsibility for the 
preservation of the literal truth and the ob- 
trusion of the ethical meaning. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, Nov. IS, 1898. 

It seems to me that this might be the right time to say 
a word or two on the matter of English and American 
Book Agencies; and I think a discussion on the subject 
in the columns of your widely read journal should prove 
both profitable and interesting. By a Book Agency, 
I understand a sort of Publishers' Bureau, where books 
could be seen, and copyrights of books bought, sold, or 
exchanged, either for America of English books, or for 
England of American publications. As things stand at 
present, only the more wealthy of publishers find it worth 
their while to keep in their employ special representatives 
across the water, to look after their interests and conduct 
negotiations for new works. A very large number of pub- 
lishers find it impossible to do this, and are at the mercy 
of a sort of blind circumstance. I don't know how you 
manage on your side, although I can fairly well guess; but 
here, one has to hawk a book round from one agency to 
another, in the hope that an edition will be bought for 
your market, or in the belief that it might be printed 
there and American copyright secured. I need not say 
that this business is a tedious affair; and to its tedious- 
ness is often added disappointment, and the vexation that 
arises from the knowledge that the individuals with whom 
one is dealing have no power to do anything on their own 
initiative, and must refer to the home office for all de- 
cisions. I have often wondered at the meaning of a system 
of establishing agencies which have not the power of act- 
ing. Of course, on very large transactions, or important 
decisions, he might, like any ambassador, be compelled 
to refer to headquarters. But the average book offered 
could easily be either accepted or rejected without keep- 
ing us waiting here for weeks or even months. 

By the time this letter reaches you, Mr. Sidney Lee's 
" Life of William Shakespeare " will have been pub- 
lished; and also the new edition of " Aurora Leigh," for 
which Mr. Swinburne has written an introduction. Mr. 
Lee's excuse for writing the Shakespeare may be put in 
his own words : " Shakespearean literature, as far as it 
is known to me, still lacks a book that shall supply 
within a brief compass an exhaustive and well-arranged 
statement of the facts of Shakespeare's career, achieve- 
ment, and reputation, that shall reduce conjecture to the 
smallest dimensions consistent with coherence, and shall 
give verifiable references to all the original sources of 
information." 

Mr. Gladstone's life will, as you know, be written 
by Mr. John Morley, and few of us will envy him the 
task of sifting the hundred thousand or so of letters 
which the English statesman collected. 

Mr. E. J. Sullivan, the talented artist whose illus- 
trations to Carlyle's " Sartor Itesartus " is announced 
to be published "shortly," has dreams of doing a sim- 
ilar service for Carlyle's " French Revolution," and, 
probably, continuing the series so as to form, in time, a 
complete illustrated edition of the works of the Chelsea 
sage. 

The fashion seems coming in for books with colored 
illustrations. Besides the edition of Jane Austen with 
colored pictures by Mr. Brock, Messrs. Macmillan have 
published Mrs. Gaskell's " Cranford " with illustrations 
in color by Hugh Thomson, and Messrs. Longmans 
have a whole series of school books and others also with 
colored plates. Why does not some enterprising pub- 
lisher do a Dickens, or a Thackeray, or a Fielding, with 
similar illustrations? TEMPLE SCOTT.

THE ROMANCE OF ROME.* 

We have long since ceased to wonder at the 
facility of Mr. Crawford in taming oat delight- 
fal stories. For sixteen years now they have 
appeared with twice the frequency of the cal- 
endars and almanacs, and with two or three 
intercalary novels to spare. Possibly, two or 
three might have been spared : for example, 
" An American Politician " or " A Rose of 
Yesterday." But the books which will main- 
tain his fame are those whose melodious titles 
end in a or e or i or o, and whose milieu is the 
faded but well-saved traditions of old Roman 
families of to-day. Between " Mr. Isaacs " 
and "Corleone " lies a cycle of romances whose 
vivid portraitures and triumphs of description 
almost persuade us that they are not of an age, 
but for all time. At any rate, their author 
has no fellow in his chosen field. And now, 
as a variation on writing Roman romances, he 
has made the city his heroine, and has given 
us the romance of Rome. 

The two sumptuous volumes before us are 
not, however, a mere hasty interlude between 
novels. There is strong external and inter- 
nal evidence that the book has been " simmer- 
ing," as George Eliot might say, for many 
years. The chapters on Leo XIII., the Vat- 
ican, and St. Peter's, with other descriptive 
passages, appeared in the "Century Maga- 
zine" in 1896, and have now been brought 
together here, leaving behind them, alas ! the 
superb illustrations by Castaigne. In one 
sense, Mr. Crawford has been writing the book 
all his life ; and the result is something which 
is history, guide-book, and narrative, and more. 
The Eternal City has often been described : 
but now she has received a sort of apotheosis. 

The plan of this great vision of Rome is 
topographical rather than chronological. A 
scant hundred pages of the first volume are 
given to a sketch of the city's history, from the 
few shepherds digging on the Palatine, down

the first volume, and all of the second except

the city has remained divided since the time 
of Augustas. This is the heart and substance

of the book ; and the dark romance of these 
various centres of princely and ecclesiastical 
life has been painted for us by the practised 
hand of a past master. From Monti to Tras- 
tevere we are guided by an incomparable cic- 
erone, who knows every foot of the ground, is 
profoundly impressed with the nobility of his 
theme, and lectures on it with the scholarship 
of a Lanciani and more than the charm of a 
Hare. Graphic description, philosophic reflec- 
tion, and acute art criticism abound in every 
chapter ; and the whole is steeped in that at- 
mosphere of affluent and felicitous expression 
which is distinctively Mr. Crawford's own. 

The embarrassment of riches overtakes us 
when we try to select for quotation passages 
which illustrate the author's treatment of his 
subject. Perhaps nothing in the book is more 
vivid and realistic than the extended account, 
in the chapter on the region " Colonna," of 
the daily life of a princely Roman family in 
the Middle Ages. So irresistibly does the 
picture confront our eyes that we say instinct- 
ively " this is contemporary observation, not 
reconstruction." 

No region was more swept by tragedy than 
the one called " Ponte," and none of its trag- 
edies has wakened more pity and terror than 
that of the Cenci. Here is a glimpse of the 
last scene in it: 

" They died bravely, there at the head of the bridge, 
in the calm May morning, in the midst of a vast and 
restless crowd, among whom more than one person was 
killed by accident, as by the falling of a pot of flowers 
from a high window, and by the breaking down of a 
balcony over a shop, where too many had crowded in to 
see. The old house opposite looked down upon the 
scene, and the people watched Beatrice Cenci die from 
those same arched windows. Above the sea of faces, 
high on the wooden scaffold, rises the tall figure of a 
lovely girl, her hair gleaming in the sunshine like 
threads of dazzling gold, her marvelous blue eyes turned 
up to heaven, her fresh young dimpled face not pale 
with fear, her exquisite lips moving softly as she repeats 
the De Prof undis of her last appeal to God. Let the 
axe not fall. Let her stand there for ever in the spot- 
less purity that cost her life on earth and set her name 
for ever among the high constellated stars of maidenly 
romance." 

In the chapter on "Sant' Angelo" Mr. 
Crawford finds the old Ghetto a convenient 
text for a short but brilliant excursus on the 
status of the Jews in Rome. He tells us that 
they have been better treated by the religious 
than by the civil authorities, and cites the fact 
that they were required to do homage to the 
latter every year in the Capitol, the Senator 
of Rome placing his foot upon the head of the 
prostrate delegates ; but

" The service they were required to do on the accession 
of a new Pope was of a different and less degrading 
nature. The Israelite School awaited the Pope's pas- 
sage, on his return from taking possession of the Lat- 
eran, standing up in a richly hung balcony, before which 
he passed on his way. They then presented him with 
a copy of the Pentateuch, which he blessed on the spot, 
and took away with him. That was all, and it amounted 
to a sanction, or permission, accorded to the Jewish 
religion." 

What the Ghetto was like can hardly be 
described ; but here is as forcible an approxi- 
mation to description as most persons would 
care to read: 

" In a low-lying space enclosed within a circuit of five 
hundred yards, and little, if at all, larger than the 
Palazzo Doria, between four and five thousand human 
beings were permanently crowded together in dwellings 
centuries old, built upon ancient drains and vaults that 
were constantly exposed to the inundations of the river 
and always reeking with its undried slime ; a little, 
pale-faced, crooked-legged, eager-eyed people, grub- 
bing and grovelling in masses of foul rags for some 
tiny scrap richer than the rest and worthy to be sold 
apart ; a people whose many women, haggard, low- 
speaking, dishevelled, toiled, half doubled together, 
upon the darning and piecing and smoothing of old 
clothes, whose many little children huddled themselves 
into corners, to teach one another to count ; a people of 
sellers who sold nothing that was not old or damaged, 
and who had nothing that they would not sell; a people 
clothed in rags, living among rags, thriving on rags ; a 
people strangely proof against pestilence, gathering 
rags from the city to their dens, when the cholera was 
raging outside the Ghetto's gates, and rags were cheap, 
yet never sickening of the plague themselves; a people 
never idle, sleeping little, eating sparingly, laboring 
for small gain amid dirt and stench aad dampness, till 
Friday night came at last, and the old crier's melan- 
choly voice rang through the darkening alleys ' The 
Sabbath has begun.' " 

Mr. Crawford's childhood was passed in 
Italy; and the Rome of Pius IX. the Rome 
of the sixties is recalled by him with an 
almost wistful fondness. The political union 
of Italy under the house of Savoy is naturally 
given scant favor; and the author " views with 
alarm " the present political and financial con- 
dition of the kingdom. " The difference," says 
he, "between Unity under Augustus and Unity 
under Victor Emmanuel is that under the 
Empire the Romans took Italy, whereas under 
the Kingdom the Italians have taken Rome " 
an epigram that pleases him so well that he 
repeats it in the second volume. 

As above noted, Mr. Crawford has brought 
together here his three articles on the Pope, 
the Vatican, and St. Peter's. In the latter, 
the most colossal temple of Christendom, he 
finds the most impressive illustration of the 
" giantism " (a word he is very fond of using) 
of the Latin race. And there, on the thresh- 



old of the great church, the author takes leave 
of his readers ; but not of his theme. 

"For a man can no more say a last farewell to Rome 
than he can take leave of eternity. The years move 
on, but she waits ; the cities fall, but she stands ; the 
old races of men lie dead in the track wherein man- 
kind wanders always between two darknesses ; yet 
Rome lives, and her changes are not from life to death, 
as ours are, but from one life to another. A man may 
live with Rome, laugh with her, dream with her, weep 
with her, die at her feet ; but for him who knows her 
there is no good-bye, for she has taken the high seat of 
his heart, and whither he goes she is with him, in joy 
or sorrow, with wonder, longing, or regret, as the chords 
of his heart were tuned by his angel in heaven." 

The volumes are flawlessly printed and 
tastefully bound. Twenty-eight photogravure 
plates just two to a region show the prin- 
cipal monuments with unsurpassed stereoscopic 
effect. One misstatement should be noted, on 
page 110 of Volume II., where Moses Men- 
delssohn is made the father of the composer, 
instead of his grandfather.

SPANISH INFLUENCES AND INSTITUTIONS 
IN AMERICA.* 



Recent events, by the course of which the 
last fragments of Spain's once vast possessions 
in the Western Hemisphere have been wrested 
from her grasp, have very naturally awakened 
an interest in Spanish- American history ; and 
one result of thi interest is likely to be seen in 
a number of new books upon subjects related to 
the Spanish colonial possessions. The appear- 
ance of Professor Moses's work on " The Estab- 
lishment of Spanish Rule in America " is there- 
fore timely, but that does not imply that it has 
been prepared with undue haste to meet a tem- 
porary demand. Dr. Moses has for many years 
past recognized the importance of the study of 
Spanish- American history to the perfect under- 
standing of some phases of our own history ; 
and some of the chapters in this book that have 
previously appeared in print have proved their 
value as contributions to the materials for a 
history of the western world. 

The necessity of close attention to the study 
of these early pages of history is apparent in 
order to a proper understanding of the causes 
of the prevalent political mismanagement and 
the revulsion from ecclesiastical domination in

those countries which, though now independent 
of Spain, we still call " Spanish-American." 
But it is also true that the history of that por- 
tion of the North American continent whose 
institutions are supposed to be of Anglo-Saxon 
origin is not to be written without reference to 
Spanish rule. That rule extended as far north 
as Nootka on the Pacific, as lately as 1793. 
The Georgia Colony was established with the 
object of restricting its northern boundary on 
the Atlantic. One of the States of the Amer- 
ican Union retains a system of jurisprudence 
derived from Spain, and others have geograph- 
ical names and land-titles which bespeak a 
former Spanish domination. 

The number of officials and the amount of 
governing attempted by Spain in her colonies 
in the New World probably exceeded those of 
any nation on record. First of all there was a 
Casa de Contratacion, established in 1503, 
through which Spain sought to control the pros- 
pective commerce of the Indies for her own 
benefit, and to make the best possible use of 
the colonies she then had in contemplation. 
This was literally a " House of Contracts," 
though Dr. Moses prefers to translate it " India 
House." It combined the functions of a Board 
of Trade and a Supreme Court of Judicature 
in all cases of Admiralty. To this institution 
Dr. Moses devotes a chapter, and gives us the 
best account thereof in English. Possibly a 
like extended notice of the Consejo de las 
Indicts (Council of the Indies) would have 
disturbed the rules of proportion established 
for this book, and the author contents him- 
self with references thereto, chiefly in his 
chapter on the " General Policy " of Spanish 
rule. 

The Consejo was established by Ferdinand 
in .l-'il 1. and was perfected by the Emperor 
Charles V. in 1524. It was principally legis- 
lative, but it was also judicial. " The worst 
features of the two worst governments in the 
world, the Gothic rule and that of the Spanish 
Moors," as some one has said, " were combined 
to form the government of Spain ; and then the 
worst features of this mongrel government were 
carefully preserved to oppress the native popu- 
lation of the Spanish possessions in the New 
World, in the code of laws sent out to them by 
the Supreme Council of the Indies." Naturally 
we would like to know more about the Consejo. 
To this council, far removed from the countries 
it was supposed to legislate for, and with little 



or no knowledge of their needs, are due many 
of the iniquities of Spanish rule in America, 
and hence much of the present day misrule in 
Spanish-American countries ; and to this coun- 
cil, with the Casa de Contratacion, was due the 
iniquitous economic policy adopted by Spain in 
her colonial affairs. 

Under these general governing boards there 
were established Audiencias, first in Santo 
Domingo, and afterwards in Mexico, Guadala- 
jara, Guatemala, Panama, and half a dozen of 
the South American cities. Ayuntamientos, or 
municipal governments, were also established, 
and have left their permanent impress upon 
the institutions of Spanish-American countries. 
For carrying out the scheme of colonial gov- 
ernment finally developed, there were Addon- 
tddos, Captains-General and Viceroys, the last- 
named capable of maintaining courts in Peru 
and New Spain (Mexico) modelled after that 
of Madrid. Besides these, there were offices 
created for the purpose of correcting abuses 
from time to time discovered in the colonies, or 
with the object of espionage ; and the official 
list finally included nearly all of the Spanish 
residents in the New World. 

In addition to these civil institutions, there 
were ecclesiastical hierarchies, which, in the 
intimate connection of the Church with the 
State under the " Most Catholic " sovereigns 
of Spain, are not to be considered separate and 
apart from the civil government in the history 
of Spanish rule in America. All this receives 
due attention from Dr. Moses, who is admir- 
ably equipped for the task he has chosen. 
And we are led to hope that he will proceed 
to give us, in the same clear and concise form, 
something upon the two other themes embraced 
in the general subject of Spanish Authority in 
America, viz : the movement toward civiliza- 
tion under that authority, and the struggles of 
the colonies to be free. We shall then feel 
that the whole Spanish-American history has 
been treated by a competent hand. 

There are errors to be found in this book, 
chiefly in the use of proper names, but these 
are probably typographical, and not such as 
Colonel Ingersoll would wish to incorporate in 
his lecture on "The Mistakes of Moses. " The 
date of the insurrection of Tupac Amaru in 
Peru is given as 1571 instead of 1780-83, which 
is an error of sufficient importance to receive 
notice and correction in a future edition.

MR. LANG ON PRIMITIVE RELIGION.* 

It is now a long time since Tylor's " Primi- 
tive Culture " appeared. About the same time, 
the well-known writings of Sir John Lub- 
bock and Mr. Herbert Spencer were published. 
Then came at least so far as books in En- 
glish are concerned a notable cessation of 
original work in that whole field. Writers were 
content to accept Tylor's " Animism " or Spen- 
cer's " Ghost Theory." The old straw was 
threshed and rethreshed, but of new grain there 
was really nothing except Frazer's Golden 
Bough. Everyone was quick to see, in new data 
secured by the traveller or anthropologist, evi- 
dence for the view he championed, but no one 
assaulted the foundations of the two theories or 
proposed new ones. 

Lately there has appeared a healthy tendency 
to reopen the whole matter, and to branch out 
in independent lines of thought. Mr. Grant 
Allen's book, " The Evolution of the Idea 
of God," shows this tendency. Its writer claims 
that it is an attempt to reconcile the ideas of 
Tylor and Spencer : it really assumes a new 
point of view regarding many questions, and 
presents a good deal of shrewd and interesting 
original thought. And now Mr. Andrew Lang 
appears with a thought - breeding book, on 
" The Making of Eeligion." 

It is a pity that Mr. Lang did not write two 
little books instead of one large one. For his 
material falls into two well-defined masses, 
whose chief connection lies in both being used 
for assaulting, somewhat bitterly, the assump- 
tions of Anthropology. His first argument has 
been somewhat shadowed forth in some of his 
earlier writings. He feels that anthropologists 
have too much neglected a great quantity of 
curious belief, experience, and practice, which 
he calls "a? phenomena." Why not investi- 
gate such things as clairvoyance, crystal vision, 
trances, and possession ? These things may not 
be understood, but they are real experiences, 
and are supposedly fit subjects for investiga- 
tion by the student of man. The best proofs 
of their reality is their occurrence, with practi- 
cal identity, in all times and among all people. 
The negro clairvoyant in South Africa, the Cree 
clairvoyant in Canada, and the ignorant medium 
in London, cannot have agreed together upon 
the details of a sham. Mr. Lang believes that 
these x phenomena have strongly assisted in the 
development of the idea of a soul. He refuses 

*THB MAKING OF RELIGION. By Andrew Lang. New 
York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



to be satisfied with the current anthropological 
teaching that the soul idea is evolved from 
dreams, reflections, and shadows, unless these 
are strongly assisted by these neglected x phe- 



nomena. 



Mr. Lang's plea is worth heeding. The phe- 
nomena deserve investigation, both for their 
inherent interest and for the importance they 
may have had in the way that he suggests. He 
has done an excellent thing in gathering and 
presenting the material he gives. His chapter 
on crystal-gazing abounds with important infor- 
mation. The practice seems to have existed 
almost everywhere and at almost all times. He 
finds it among Polynesians, Egyptians, Apaches, 
Iroquois, South Africans, in Madagascar and 
India, among ancient Greeks, Romans, and 
Peruvians. To his list we may add Tonkaways, 
Cherokees, and ancient Mexicans. Yet, notwith- 
standing its wide distribution in space and time, 
no serious ethnic study has been made of it. 

Mr. Lang's second subject is not clearly con- 
nected with his first. Anthropologists have gen- 
erally held that the idea of a supreme, kind, 
creative being, who is worshipped, is a late con- 
ception in religion. It has been considered 
a development from the much earlier conception 
of spirits and ancestral gods. Where lower 
people mention such a being, it has been assumed 
that they have been influenced by Christian or 
other foreign ideas. Mr. Lang boldly lunges 
at these time-honored theories. He collects an 
astonishing lot of evidence for a contrary idea. 
With him, a supreme, kind, creative being, 
worshipped by a people, is an ancient, almost 
a primitive conception, preceding, perhaps, in 
many cases the idea of spirits. Besides his mass 
of evidence for the existence of ideas relative 
to a supreme being among uncontaminated 
lower peoples, Mr. Lang presents a logical 
argument against the usual view. He does not 
actually refuse ideas regarding spirits to early 
man. That primitive creature may early have 
had a variety of notions in his mind : but among 
his earliest original conceptions is the idea of 
a kind, creative, supreme being, whom men may 
worship. 

We cannot discuss Mr. Lang's book fully. 
To answer his argument and it must be an- 
swered, or prevalent ideas must be greatly mod- 
ified will task the best workers in the field 
for some time to come. The book is a bomb : 
it will cause some scurrying, but the effect 
will be good. 

Mr. Lang has an Englishman's prejudice 
against foreign authorities. He knows few

[Dec. 1, 



American books. Much as he is interested 
in the firewalk and possession, he does not know 
Percival Lowell's Japanese evidence. He has 
read Mr. George Bird Grinnell, as he ought ; 
but plainly he read the Pawnee book more care- 
fully than he did the one about Blackfeet. He 
knows some of the papers in the Bureau of 
Ethnology Reports, but not many. To be sure, 
in this respect we must sympathize with his 
plaint. Referring to a voluminous report on the 
Ghost Dance, he says : " Republican Govern- 
ments publish scientific matter ' regardless of 
expense/ and the essential points might have 
been put more shortly." The fact that our 
government scientists appear to write " by the 
page " is admitted, and forms some excuse for 
a busy man's not trying absolutely to read what 
they write. Still, one loses something by not 
doing so, and there is a good deal of American 
material of which Mr. Lang is ignorant which 
might have been used in his argument.

book of Mr. Henry Savage Landor, containing

to provoke the attacks upon him. He was not 
only a trespasser, but his violation of Thibetan 
law followed immediately upon several official 
notifications, personally made, of the inhibition 
against European investigation. He repeatedly 
insulted, in the grossest manner, minor officials 
with whom he had to deal. And he himself 
gives abundant justification, in his account of 
the misrule of the Lamas, for the law against 
just such a traveller as he was. He was cer- 
tainly not a friendly or an impartial visitor, 
and his hostile and aggressive attitude inevi- 
tably impairs somewhat the force of his obser- 
vations, and even mitigates the feeling of 
outrage and horror attending the reading of his 
account of the cruel tortures inflicted upon him 
by the Thibetans. His boastfulness is incred- 
ible almost surpassing, let us say, that of 
some of the newspaper correspondents in the 
Cuban War. He gives us to understand that, 
had he not unguardedly laid down his rifie 
when within four days of Lhassa, he would 
have gained that holy city in spite of Lamas, 
soldiers, and people. At that time his follow- 
ing consisted of two coolies, one a leper and 
crippled; and they were without provisions. 
Troops of several hundreds of men, fierce in 
their pursuit of him, bowed to the earth when 
he confronted them with his rifie and camera, 
and ran away at the first opportunity. There 
were undoubtedly superstitions at work, and 
the photographic apparatus may well have 
been mightier than the sword in its moral 
effects; but it is impossible to rid one's self 
of the feeling of exaggeration. With all this, 
however, there is no more doubt of the writer's 
courage and hardihood than there is of the 
interest of the book. What he did for science 
he sets forth thus : 

"I submit, with all deference, the following geo- 
graphical results of my expedition: 

" The solution of the uncertainty regarding the di- 
vision of the Mansarowar aud Rakstal Lakes [doubtful]. 

" The ascent to so great an altitude as 'J'J,000 feet, 
and the pictures of some of the great Himahlyan [ne] 
glaciers. 

" The visit to and the fixing of the position of the 
two principal sources of the Brahmaputra, never before 
reached by a European. 

The fact that with only two men I was able to 
travel for so long in the most populated [sir] part of 
Tibet." 

And here is a typical account of a typical 
adventure of Mr. Lander's in the forbidden 
country, his opponents in this instance being 
brigands rather than soldiers, though identical 
results followed : 

" The band of dacoits approached and left the yaks

in charge of two women. When they galloped in a line 
towards us, my men, with the exception of Chanden 
Sing and Mansing [the faithful twain who were with 
him to the end], were paralyzed with fright. 

" They were now a hundred yards off. With loaded 
rifle in one hand, and my camera in the other, I 
advanced to meet them, knowing that, with their old- 
fashioned matchlocks, it takes them a considerable time 
to light the fuse and fire a shot. Moreover, it is almost 
impossible for them to fire on horseback, their weapons 
being heavy and cumbersome. 

" I focussed them in my twin lens photographic ap- 
paratus, and waited until I had them well in the field. 
I snapped the shot when they were only thirty yards 
away, vaulting over their ponies in the act of dismount- 
ing. The camera, having done its work, was quickly 
deposited on the ground, and the rifle shouldered. I 
shouted to them to put down their weapons, and to give 
force to my request I aimed at them with my Mann- 
licher. 

" A meeker lot of brigands I do not believe could be 
found, though people of that kind are often brave when 
it is easy for them to be courageous. Their matchlocks 
were unslung from their shoulders with remarkable 
quickness and flung to the ground, and their jewelled 
swords were laid by the side of their firearms. They 
went down on their knees, and, taking off their caps with 
both hands, put out their tongues in sign of salute and 
submission,and I could not help taking another snap-shot 
at them in that attitude, which was comical, to say the 
least of it." 

This is certainly a novel use of the deadly 
camera, which in this case was probably taken 
for a new form of Gatling gun. Mr. Landor 
does well to record the episode. To photo- 
graph a squadron of horsemen charging on 
your front, before taking them prisoners single- 
handed, is a feat to make Mr. James Creel- 
man turn green with envy. He should have 
had a camera, with his pencil and spy-glass, 
when he captured his fort at El Caney. 

Both Mr. Merewether and the manner of 
his interesting book, " A Tour through the 
Famine District of India," assure us that he 
was connected with a newspaper (in Bombay) 
before his expedition, and that he undertook it 
by way of newsgetting, acting, as the British 
phrase goes, as Special Commissioner for the 
Reuter News-Service. He was looking for sen- 
sations, and, by the very terms of an Indian 
famine, he had not far to seek. When found, 
they were photographed for corroboration in 
the likenesses of human beings whose hunger 
was apparent in every wasted muscle and 
knotted joint. Two somewhat contradictory 
things were accomplished by Mr. Merewether : 
he gives us a picture of the British administra- 
tion in India, laying aside all its customs and 
functions as a government in the western sense, 
taking up instead the duties of a beneficent des- 



potism, and subordinating everything to the 
alleviation of the misery of its subject peoples ; 
and he writes down the following eulogy of Mr. 
Julian Hawthorne, who has been somewhat 
effusively blamed both in England and America 
for sending out reports derogatory to the com- 
fort of the ruling race : 

"Mr. Julian Hawthorne . . . made a most careful 
and extended tour through the Central Provinces, and 
other parts of the famine districts of India. He was 
able to devote much more time to his mission than I, in 
view of my rapid and extended tour through the length 
and breadth of the land, could compass. Since his re- 
turn to the States, he has contributed a series of preg- 
nant articles upon the subject, and being a man with 
the trained faculty of observation very largely developed 
his statements may be accepted as the plain and unvar- 
nished facts of the case, as seen by himself in proprid 
persona" 

It may be taken as true that the persons who 
died in spite of the strenuous efforts of the ad- 
ministration are those who would have been 
dead long before under a native regime. There 
was certainly nothing in the way of relief 
omitted, once the famine code was declared in 
operation. That there was delay in this, and 
that the government did not move until the 
press became clamorous, are nothing more than 
new examples of a familiar thing. 

The woman traveller in foreign parts is either 
what has been comprehensively called since 
Shakespeare's time a " good fellow," or a very 
great bore. Miss Sykes is a good fellow ; and 
the reading world may very well be glad that 
her brother, when appointed the British consul 
to open up relations with Kerman and other 
remote parts, had the good sense to take so 
cheerful and wholesome a companion with him. 
Miss Sykes went " Through Persia on a Side 
Saddle," as her title proclaims, and with her 
eyes wide open to a series of things which would 
have escaped the slower-witted man. She 
discovered, for example, that the dreadful 
problem of domestic service, which we look 
upon as solved in Britain, she expected to find 
solved in Persia, and with this result, as she 
phrases it : 

" Every lady in Persia with whom I discussed the 
' servant question ' confessed to an intense irritation of 
the nerves, engendered by struggling with these lazy 
Orientals; and one went so far as to say that she some-

tunities through her brother's position, a volume 
both of interest and importance results. 

Siam is the home of rubies in all the glory 
of perfection, and Mr. H. Warington Smyth, 
who writes of his " Five Years in Siam," was, 
during much of the time he describes, the direc- 
tor of the department of the mines of the king- 
dom. For the first time, therefore, we have 
not only an account of a matter which has long 
been shrouded in mystery by the native rulers, 
but one written by an expert upon this very 
topic. He draws a likeness of the seeker after 
precious stones which is admirable in succinct- 
ness. 

" The Shah seems by nature designed for the pursuit 
of gems. He is bitten with the roving spirit, and in 
addition he has the true instinct of the miner, to whom 
the mineral be lives to pursue possesses a subtle charm, 
which constrains him never to rest or weary of its search 
against all odds. The sentiment is quite different to the 
ararice of the victims of a gold mania. . . The Gula 
regards this as a world where man must live by his wits, 
and sees no harm in profiting by the want of experience 
of a fellow-man. I have known a European, who gave 
up a permanent post in Bangkok to go gem-mining, put 
his whole earnings into the purchase of some thousand 
carats of glass. The men he dealt with found that glass 
pleased him as much as the real article, and that he was 
ready to pay for glass ; so glass, of beauteous ruby and 
sapphire colors, without a flaw, they gave him in large 
quantities." 

Of the first value in the chapters on the mines, 
Mr. Smyth's book is also fresh and interesting 
throughout. He does not hesitate at criticism, 
whether of his own people or another, and does 
not talk without saying something. The book 
is well indexed. 

The Gold Coast Colony is that familiar spot 
in Africa which has been known for many cen- 
turies as Guinea. It is an unwholesome and a 
malarious spot, formerly celebrated for its ex- 
ports of gold, ivory; and slaves, and since the 
Ashanti wars famous for nothing in particular 
except missionaries. The Rev. Dennis Kemp 
is one of these indefatigable workers for the 
spread of Christian doctrine, and his "Nine 
Years at the Gold Coast" describes his personal 
experience. He says a good word for the native, 
quotes with mingled shame and delight the 
words of one of his dark-skinned colleagues who 
urged his brethren to shun strong waters, " lest 
they become as drunken as the English " ! and 
sets down an interesting bit of savagery, thus : 

"The mount [Croboe] was for the most part kept 
sacred, as a residence for girls of the age of fourteen years 
and upwards. As many as 4,700 found their way there 
during 1891. The girls usually remained on the mount 
for a year or eighteen months, under the care of priests 
and priestesses. Previous to sending a damsel to the 



mount, the friends were in the habit of slaughtering 
a number of sheep; the number slain was supposed to be 
proportionate to the wealth of the family, which was often 
put to great inconvenience in order to keep up appear- 
ances. The fat of the slaughtered sheep was placed upon 
the head of the young lady [woman is hardly included in 
Mr. Kemp's vocabulary], who was required to wear 
a curiously shaped hat while she went through the test 
of walking over very steep slippery slabs of stone. In the 
event of the hat falling from her head, the unfortunate 
girl was sent back to her family in great disgrace. Those 
who passed the test were expected to wear the strange or- 
nament during the whole of the term of their residence." 

It is expecting too much to look for scientific 
attainments in missionaries of the present day, 
but the book would have been made much more 
valuable had Mr. Kemp had eyes for physical 
as well as spiritual phenomena. As it is, it 
succeeds in presenting in the reading matter 
all the arguments in favor of such missions, 
and all against them between the lines. 

All that the Rev. Mr. Kemp's book lacks 
in the way of specialized information is well 
made up by Mr. George Macdonald's " The 
Gold Coast, Past and Present." An official of 
the government, who filled more than one im- 
portant post under the Crown, Mr. Macdonald 
had unusual facilities for obtaining knowledge, 
as well as the ability to set down his store in 
due order, without prolixity and with a proper 
sense of proportion. He even contrives to 
give us a clearer conception of the work of the 
missionaries themselves. The most interesting 
matter in the book, perhaps, is the account 
of Lsetitia Elizabeth Landon, the "L. E. L." 
of our grandmothers, whose marriage to the 
governor of the Gold Coast, and her death and 
burial within its borders, have been quite for- 
gotten. Says Mr. Macdonald: 

" In the triangular courtyard of Cape Coast Castle 
lie the mortal remains of the poetess . . . and Presi- 
dent Maclean. The local practice of intermural sep- 
ulture was here followed, and ... a neat tablet on the 
wall near by bears record of the death of the poetess, 
and the survivor's grief. Mr. and Mrs. Maclean 
landed at Cape Coast in August, 1838 (they had been 
married a fortnight before sailing). The poetess died 
on the loth of October, and her husband followed her 
in May, 1847, to the great regret of the whole popula- 
tion." 

The book is to be commended to those in search 
of information concerning a region of increas- 
ing importance. 

So happy a conjunction of men, women, and 
things as Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd, a number 
of astronomers, a sea-voyage from San Fran- 
cisco to Japan, a total eclipse, and much inter- 
course with the strange and disappearing race 
of Ainus, could hardly fail in making a book

interesting; and Mrs. Todd's "Corona and 
Coronet" is interesting throughout. There 
was nothing hackneyed about the expedition, 
in manner, destination, objects, incidentals, or 
personnel ; and there is nothing stale or un- 
profitable in Mrs. Todd's description of it. 
She tells of the long journey made by the as- 
tronomers from Amherst College to the land 
of the Ainus, for the purpose of observing the 
total eclipse of August 9, 1896, most of it on 
the yacht " Coronet," owned by Mr. Arthur 
Curtiss James. The manner of the narrative 
is almost colloquial, and happily so, since it 
carries off a quantity of technical matters that 
might otherwise be a little indigestible. But 
it is not all colloquial, as this description of 
the supreme moment of totality bears witness : 

" Grayer and grayer grew the day, narrower and 
narrower the crescent of shining sunlight. Theseafaded 
to leaden nothingness. Armies of crows which had pre- 
tended entire indifference, gazing abroad upon the scene, 
. . flew off in a body in heavy haste. . . Sampans and 
junks faded together into colorlessness ; but grass and 
verdure turned suddenly vivid yellow-green. A pene- 
trating chill fell across the land, as if a door had been 
opened into a long-closed vault. It was a moment of 
appalling suspense ; something was being waited for 
the very air was portentous. The circling sea-gulls 
disappeared with strange cries. One white butterfly 
fluttered by vaguely. Then an instantaneous darkness 
leaped upon the world. Unearthly night enveloped all. 

" With an indescribable out-flashing at the same in- 
stant, the corona burst forth in mysterious radiance. 
But dimly seen through thin cloud, it was nevertheless 
beautiful beyond description, a celestial flame from 
some unimaginable heaven. Simultaneously the whole 
northwestern sky, nearly to the zenith, was flooded with 
lurid and startlingly brilliant orange, across which 
drifted clouds slightly darker, like flecks of liquid 
flame, or huge ejecta from some vast volcanic Hades." 

The book is handsomely designed and well illus- 
trated. 

By way of contrast with the foregoing vol- 
umes, all of which treat of a single state or 
nation and contain much original matter, is the 
well illustrated book called " An American 
Cruiser in the Far East." Its author, Mr. 
John D. Ford, is Fleet Engineer of the Pacific 
Station, and was with Dewey at Manila. His 
book is a summary of all he has learned by 
travel and from written authorities during his 
long sojourn in the far East, and is particularly 
valuable just now in what it has to say of the 
Philippines. Here is a description of one of 
the wholly unconsidered problems which the 
proposed American occupancy of Manila opens 
for settlement : 

" Cigar manufacture is a monopoly of the government, 
and the manufactory covers several acres of ground. It 



is a very interesting place to visit; twelve thousand wo- 
men and girls are at work. . . . Here one sees all the 
processes of stripping, assorting, filling, rolling, pasting, 
counting, and packing in boxes, the rolls of fragrant 
weed. At the noon hour and in the evening, when the 
women leave the premises, they are all searched, to 
make sure that no scraps of tobacco are taken away." 

There are also some pictures of the inhabitants 
of the neighboring islands, which leave us won- 
dering if some of our future " statesmen " will 
ever be suspected of, say, cannibalistic prac- 
tices, in order to gain their vote. The one ob- 
jection to Mr. Ford's book is that it covers more 
ground than can possibly be done thoroughly ; 
but it is interesting nevertheless. 

It is likely, as Mrs. Miriam Coles Harris's 
pleasant book, "A Corner of Spain," goes far 
to prove, that a sympathetic picture of the 
Spaniard is only to be drawn by one who has 
no prejudices against Roman Catholicism. 
One of our best reasons for disliking him, 
quite an impersonal one, she sets forth with 
some shrewdness : 

"I shall always think our prejudice against the Span- 
ish is based upon their physical differences from us. 
We dislike them for their complexion, which is swarthy, 
and for their features, which are forbidding. The 
treachery is a matter of coloring ; and the cruelty, of 
outline. They are the kindest people in the world, and 
as honest as nous autres." 

And in the latter part of the really interesting 
little book she adds the following to her charac- 
terization : 

" Their hospitality is frank and generous ; and at the 
same time, if it is gene to them, they will not for mere 
good manners do much for you. If they have taken a 
fancy to you, or are sorry for you, they cannot do too 
much." 

Mrs. Harris's particular corner of Spain was 
Malaga. Her account of it, the almost 
universal recurrence of small-pox, the total 
absence of sanitation, the picturesqueness, the 
squalor, the piety, all serves for a picture of 
the Spaniard everywhere, in San Juan, Manila, 
or Havana, as well as in Malaga. 

Mr. Charles F. King's " Roundabout Ram- 
bles in Northern Europe " is a guide-book cast 
in the form of a family journey through the 
principal countries of the Continent, north of 
the Latin line a line which, it occurs to us, is 
not unlike the Mason and Dixon's line of our 
own country before the war. The book is replete 
with photographic illustrations, and, with little 
claim to literary form, contrives to be inter- 
esting in a catholic sort of manner, which may 
serve its modest purpose better than many a 
more pretentious work.

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 



For several seasons past the Messrs. Putnam have 
been conspicuously in the field at this season with 
an elaborate edition of a single work of Irving's. 
We have already had the " Darro " edition of the 
" Alhambra," the " Agapida " " Conquest of Gran- 
ada," the - Backthorne " Tales of a Traveller," 
the " Surrey " " Bracebridge Hall," and so forth. 
This season a welcome arrival is the "Pawnee 
Edition " of the ever fresh and delightful " Adven- 
tures of Captain Bonneville." The younger gener- 
ation of readers may not be so familiar as their 
fathers were with this remarkable picture of life 
about and beyond the Rocky Mountain region in the 
days when the Indian, the trapper, and the " grizzly " 
virtually were supreme. So a word as to the author 
for the book is essentially Captain Bonneville's 
may not be amiss. Captain Bonneville was an officer 
in the American Army, who, being smitten with 
a thirst for far-western adventure, obtained leave 
of absence in 1831 for an exploring expedition to the 
Rockies. The Captain departed on his mission, was 
engulfed in the then nearly untrodden wilderness, and 
for three years nothing was heard of him. The term 
of his leave of absence expired. At last it was con- 
cluded that he was dead, or that he had " turned 
Indian " (as men of his blood and temperament 
sometimes do), and his name was struck off the 
Army List. Suddenly, in 1835, Captain Bonneville 
returned to civilization and applied to his superiors 
at Washington for reinstatement. It was about 
this time that Irving met him first at the dinner 
table of John Jacob Astor (who must have revelled 
in the Captain's " yarns "), and later at Washington, 
where he found him rewriting the notes of his won- 
derful journey and making maps of the country 
traversed. The mass of manuscript thus prepared 
he subsequently entrusted to Irving, who made it 
the basis of the narrative now before us. Substan- 
tially, this book is Captain Bonneville's Journal 
shaped and amplified by Irving. The "Pawnee 
Edition " of it is perhaps the most important, cer- 
tainly the most ornate, one yet published. There are 
two finely printed, showily bound volumes, which 
contain in all 28 photogravure illustrations of pass- 
able interest and quality. These represent mainly 
incidents of Indian life, and striking examples of 
western scenery. In point of decoration the chief 
feature is the pale-blue border-design of scroll-work 
which encloses the text on each page as the frame 
encloses the picture. The effect is pleasing. 

Messrs. Dent & Co., of London, have reissued 
their pretty ten-volume edition of " Jane Austen," 
with added attractions, and The Macmillan Co. are 
its American publishers. There is nothing on our 
list more enticing than these captivating little 16mo 
volumes. The special new feature of this edition is 
the illustrations in color, about six of them to the 
volume, by Messrs. C. E. and H. M. Brock. A good 
many otherwise beautiful books that we could 



mention have been marred by this always risky 
experiment of colored pictures. But in the present 
instance the effect is charming. The plates are in 
harmony with their setting, and they are prettily 
done and tastefully conceived in themselves light, 
vivacious, decorative, emblematic. Then the colors 
are not too flaring, too strikingly at odds with the 
sobriety of the printed page. The shades employed 
are cool and subdued, and there is no suggestion of 
an oily vehicle, no sticky, varnishy surface always 
an abomination in book illustrations. How many 
pretty books have been half spoiled by those oil- 
cloth-like pictures, to which the tissues stick so 
provokingly ! The initial frontispiece of the set is 
after Zoffany's quaint portrait of Miss Austen at 
sixteen " sweet sixteen " in her case, evidently. 
Jane Austen's could hardly have been one of those 
cases in which genius is bestowed upon a woman 
as compensation for a lack of physical charms. The 
edition is well edited by Mr. Reginald Brimley 
Johnson, who supplies an informing introductory 
sketch of the author, besides a preface of a page or 
two to each novel, and other helpful editorial ad- 
juncts. The works are printed in their order of 
publication, from the text of the last editions revised 
by the author. " Lady Susan " is omitted, as we 
think, judiciously. Otherwise the edition is a com- 
plete one. 

Whatever advantage there may be in having a 
set of Jane Austen's works that is quite complete 
is possessed by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. 'a new 
edition in twelve 16mo volumes. These include all 
the novels and stories, the letters, and an extended 
memoir. The volumes are of a type less ornate 
and decorative than those of the Dent edition 
described above ; but they are tastefully bound and 
well printed, pleasing to the eye and convenient to 
the hand. The set is therefore an excellent one for 
actual use, and its price is moderate. Each volume 
contains a frontispiece picture by Mr. Edmund H. 
Garrett, whose drawings, as usual, are refined and 
animated. 

The showy oblong volume entitled " Ships and 
Sailors" (Stokes) makes a strong bid for popular 
favor. "Jack Tar" is just now (and rightly) the 
national hero ; and the national heart warms at once 
to whatever appertains to him and his ways. Mr. 
James Barnes is partly author, partly compiler of the 
book ; and Mr. R. F. Zogbaum, who knows a ship 
and a sailor when he sees them, is the illustrator. 
The text consists mostly of sea-songs some of them 
new, more of them " old and choicely good," the lat- 
ter category ranging from the immortal ditties of Gay 
and Dibdin, to the roaring " chantry " of the nameless 
fo'ks'le bard. Mr. Barnes is the author of the newer 
songs. He has essayed to do for the " Jackies " 
of the modern ironclad what the old song-writers did 
for the tarry race (now gone) who wore pig-tails, did 
miracles with ropes and marlin-spikes, and went 
down to the sea in real ships. Mr. Barnes's songs 
ring true ; they are racy, resonant, and " singable." 
We are glad to see those fine old favorites, " Wapping

Old Stairs," " Poor Jack," " The White Squall," 
Black Ball," " Nancy Tree," etc., included. Mr. 
Zogbaum's pictures consist of twelve plates in colors, 
and twenty- six in black-and-white. Notably good 
are the pictures on pages 29, 62, and 89. There is 
no need of characterizing this artist's familiar work 
in this field. Many of the songs, it should be added, 
are printed with the musical notes. 

The Misses Maude and Genevieve Cowles deserve 
in the main hearty praise for the illustrations in 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and Co.'s chaste two- 
volume holiday edition of Hawthorne's " The House 
of the Seven Gables." There are twenty plates in 
all. Some of the figures are very happily con- 
ceived, notably Hepzibah herself, Judge Pynch- 
eon, and the chance customers at the "cent shop." 
The " Miscellaneous Old Gentleman " and " Dixey " 
are admirably done. With Phoebe, Clifford, and 
Holgrave, the illustrators have not succeeded so 
well. Phoebe seems at times (on page 58, for 
instance) a little wooden, while the lankness of 
Holgrave and even of Clifford is overdone to the 
verge of caricature. But the pictorial ensemble is 
good, and we should very much like to see these 
refined and sympathetic illustrators try their hands 
at an edition of "The Scarlet Letter." The vol- 
umes are gotten up in the best taste, the delicate 
yet practical bindings calling for special mention. 

As a gift-book for a fastidious friend of literary 
tastes, few things of the season are more suitable 
than Miss Elizabeth L. Gary's " Tennyson ; his 
Homes, his Friends, and his Work " (Putnam). 
The volume is a handsomely appointed large octavo, 
of sumptuous yet substantial pictorial attractions, 
consisting mainly of photogravure portraits of the 
poet's friends Hallam, Spedding, Jowett, Brown- 
ing, Carlyle, Irving, Dean Bradley, etc. Other 
plates show the different homes of Tennyson, the 
Memorial at Freshwater, and Rossetti's and Hunt's 
drawings of St. Cecily and The Lady of Shalott. 
The frontispiece is after Watt's noble portrait of the 
poet. Miss Gary's text is an outline sketch of 
Tennyson's life, so thickly studded throughout with 
critical estimates of his character and work, quoted 
from various sources, foreign as well as English, that 
it is perhaps not unfair to style it an ordered 
anthology in this kind. The author's own contri- 
bution in the way of narrative and appreciation is 
graceful, sympathetic, and discriminating. Tenny- 
sonians will be glad to find in Miss Gary's pages 
certain matter hitherto unpublished, or not widely 
published, notably a letter (for which we must 
thank Professor Norton) touching Tennyson's 
introduction to this country; a review of "The 
Princess " by Lowell, and extracts from French and 
German critiques. German appreciation of Tenny- 
son is usually a little cold. Herr Bleibtreu, for 
instance, denies that he was a poet " in the higher 
and highest sense of the word," and finds that while 
his roses have no tborns, they also, like the Bengal 
roses, have no scent. Herr Engel thinks that "of 
Tennyson's many volumes, very little, perhaps only 



a song here and there, will survive." We counsel 
those looking for a gift-book of the better class not 
to overlook this attractive and worthy volume. 

Mr. W. B. Macdougall has been fairly successful 
in his decoration of the thin volume containing Ros- 
setti's " The Blessed Damozel" (L. C. Page & Co.). 
We are glad to say that Mr. Macdougall has not 
attempted to illustrate the poem an attempt fore- 
doomed to failure in any hands but the poet's own. 
That Rossetti himself might have measurably suc- 
ceeded here is indicated by his exquisite study of 
the head of the Blessed Damozel which forms the 
frontispiece of the present volume and consti- 
tutes its most attractive adjunct. The stanzas are 
printed one to the page, each framed in a heavy 
black border with arabesques in white. Here Mr. 
Macdougall has displayed a delicate fancy and much 
taste. But we repeat, we are glad he has not set his 
pencil the hopeless task of drawing mysticism and 
music. Even Rossetti's head seems, when we think 
of the Damozel of the poem, " of the earth earthy.' ' 
The text now given is the first British reprint of the 
poem as it stood in "The Germ." There was an 
American reprint in 1894, a private one of twenty- 
five copies done by the DeVinne Press for Mr. 
C. L. Williams, as we learn from Mr. W. M. Ros- 
setti's interesting introduction to this volume. The 
book is a pretty one, and should find friends. 

Amateur photographers who make a serious study 
of their favorite pursuit will be glad to learn that 
Mr. W. Lincoln Adams, author of " Sunlight and 
Shadow," has followed up that excellent manual 
with a similar and supplementary volume, entitled 
" In Nature's Image " (Baker & Taylor), in which 
he leads the reader " a little farther along the pleas- 
ant paths of pictorial photography." In the volume 
first named, it may be remembered, the treatment 
was confined to landscape photography alone, to the 
exclusion of the more advanced and perhaps more 
difficult work of figure composition, portraiture, and 
kindred subjects. Mr. Adams now proceeds to dis- 
cuss, in separate chapters, Landscape and Figures 
(work in which the figures are small and merely 
accessory to the landscape) ; Figures and Land- 
scape (work wherein the figures form the principal 
feature and the landscape the setting or background 
only) ; Genre ; Telling a Story ; The Nude ; Por- 
traiture at Home ; Children ; Flower Photography ; 
Interiors. It will be seen that in his two volumes 
the author has covered the ground pretty thor- 
oughly, so far as the selection of subjects is con- 
cerned. Mr. Adams, we need scarcely say, is 
himself an expert with the camera as the three 
examples of his work included in the volume attest ; 
and each chapter contains practical suggestions 
based on years of experience in the different branches 
of photography. The volume is a rather sumptuous 
flat quarto, full gilt, and neatly boxed. The text is 
handsomely printed on rather thick paper glazed to 
the degree required by the exigencies of the picture- 
making. There are ninety-three plates in all, full- 
page and vignette, the selected work of many camera

experts. Some of the specimens are very beautiful, 
and the collection aa a whole is varied and interest- 
ing. The work forms a pretty and tasteful gift- 
book for anyone, and an especially suitable one for 
a friend with a bent for photography. 

A happy thought is tastefully embodied in Esther 
Singleton's " Turrets, Towers, and Temples " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The author has selected, with good 
literary judgment, passages from the writings of 
famous authors wherein are described the most cele- 
brated buildings of Europe and the Orient. These 
passages form the suggestive and sometimes instruc- 
tive setting for the well executed photographic 
plates, whereof there are forty-eight The author 
has aimed to make her selections from the works of 
such writers as have felt and expressed the romantic 
spirit, as well as the architectural beauty and grand- 
eur, of the edifices described. The description of 
St. Mark's, at Venice, for instance, is from Ruskin ; 
that of Antwerp Cathedral is from Thackeray ; the 
Kremlin, from Gautier ; the Escurial, from De 
Amicis ; Strasburg Cathedral, from Victor Hugo ; 
the Temples of Nikko, Japan, from Loti ; the Taj 
Mahal, from Andre' Chevrillon ; and so on. The 
book is for the general reader and the lover of good 
literature, rather than the professional architect 
though the latter may well relish these eloquent 
tributes to the masterpieces of his profession. With 
one exception, the translations are done by the com- 
piler of the book ; and they are well done. 

Mr. Thomas B. Mosher's dainty publications are, 
as usual, among the more desirable books of the 
season, whether for holiday gifts or for the collec- 
tions of bibliophiles. This year there are thirteen 
of them, including one of greater importance than 
anything heretofore attempted by the publisher. 
Beginning our enumeration with the smallest of 
them all, we have to mention six additions to the 
" Brocade " series of booklets printed on Japan 
vellum. Four of the six are " Imaginary Portraits " 
by Walter Pater, their subjects being Denys 1'Aux- 
errois, Sebastian van Storck, Duke Carl of Rosen- 
mold, and Watteau, " A Prince of Court Painters." 
The other two are ''Quattrocentisteria," a chapter 
from Mr. Maurice Hewlett's "Earthwork out of 
Tuscany," and " The Tale of King Florus and the 
fair Jehane," as translated from "the ancient 
French " by William Morris. To the " Old World " 
series, which now numbers fourteen volumes, four 
additions are made this year. Rossetti's " House 
of Life " reprints the entire sequence of 102 sonnets. 
Mr. George Meredith's " Modern Love," which was 
Mr. Mosher's first publication, is here reissued, with 
additional pieces taken from the " Poems " of 1851 
and later volumes, together with the great "Ode 
on France." Here we get the real Meredith, not 
the fantastic maker of verbal puzzles that recent 
readers chiefly know. " The Story of My Heart," 
by Richard Jefferies, and " Underneath the Bough," 
by " Michael Field," are the two other books added 
to this series. The first of the two needs no com- 
ment ; the second is a book of lyrics, new and old, 



which happily differs from the greater number of 
Mr. Mosher's publications in being both sanctioned 
and arranged for publication by the author. The 
" Bibelot " series receives no accessions this year. 
Mr.J.W.Mackail's prose translation of the Eclogues 
of Virgil is a little book belonging to no series. It 
has a distinctive style of its own, marked by a dec- 
orative border on each page, a cover design, and a 
photogravure frontispiece. Mr. Swinburne's " Hep- 
talogia, or the Seven against Sense," is a reprint 
that is peculiarly welcome. First published in 1880, 
it had no name upon its title-page, but the author- 
ship soon became an open secret. It is a collection 
of the best verse parodies ever written, their vic- 
tims being Tennyson, Browning,Whitman,Patmore, 
Lord Ly 1 1 on, Rossetti, and Mr. Swinburne himself. 
The poet is thus himself the only survivor of a 
group all of whose members were living at the time 
of the original publication. Not inappropriately, 
the piece called " Disgust : A Dramatic Mono- 
logue," which is in quite the'same vein of humorous 
mockery, is also reprinted. It parodies Tennyson's 
Despair," which was published in a review, No- 
vember, 1881. The parody followed promptly one 
month later. The most important of Mr. Mosher's 
reprints, as we have already hinted, is the one re- 
maining for description. It is nothing less than 
"The Germ," reproduced without abridgment, 
etchings and all, with facsimiles of the original 
wrappers. Nothing has been spared to make this 
edition all that the most exacting bibliophile could 
ask, as well as all that could be wished by the pur- 
chaser who values "The Germ" chiefly for its 
importance in the history of Victorian literature, 
and who welcomes it as a long-desired part of his 
literary apparatus rather than as a choice example 
of bookmaking. This little periodical," The Germ.' 
the seed which put forth two cotyledons, and then 
called itself Art and Poetry,' and put forth two 
more little leaves, and then seemed to die," has a 
place in English literary history that cannot fail to 
suggest the place occupied in our own by the orig- 
inal " Dial." It is true that the motive was art in 
the one case and philosophy in the other, that four 
thin numbers made up the sum of " The Germ," 
while " The Dial " lived to complete four volumes ; 
but a common spirit animated the two ventures, and 
a large proportion of the contents of each was des- 
tined to take a place in the permanent literature of 
the two countries neither knowing its own prophets 
until long afterwards. How germinal was The 
Germ " is evident enough from an inspection of the 
work which it included. Rossetti's " Blessed Dam- 
ozel," " Hand and Soul," and " Sonnets for Pic- 
tures," his sister Christina's " Dreamland," and 
other lyrics, and the poems by Thomas Woolner, 
Coventry Patmore, and W. Bell Scott, are all, if 
not classical themselves, at least pregnant with 
promise. " How strange it seems, and new " to 
read them here, in this modest setting, when we 
think of the significance of the names attached to 
them. How strange, too, to read these critical re-

views of early volumes of Clough and Arnold and 
Browning. By way of specification, we may say 
that the present reprint (which is not a facsimile, 
and extends to some twenty pages more than the 
original) is enriched by a preface, by James Ash- 
croft Noble, " A Pre-Raphaelite Magazine," as it 
was written for an English periodical in 1882, an 
appendix giving the two later recensions of " The 
Blessed Damozel," a number of helpful notes, and 
by an index which identifies the writers of all the 
poems and papers comprised in the four issues of 
" The Germ." Except for the special interest at- 
taching to first editions, this reprint is a far more 
desirable possession than a set of the original num- 
bers, and Mr. Mosher is a public benefactor in 
furnishing for five dollars what has hitherto been 
unattainable for less than fifty. The mechanical 
execution of the volume is in every way dignified 
and beautiful. 

The egotism that peeps through more than one of 
the essays composing Dr. Charles C. Abbott's little 
book, " Clear Skies and Cloudy " (Lippincott), is 
not the sweet and engaging egotism of Montaigne. 
For one who has communed much with Nature and 
worshipped alone in her temple in season and out of 
season, Dr. Abbott appears to fidget a good deal 
about what the world is likely to think of him. 
The moment he scents a probable critic in his 
reader ( which is pretty often) he is all prickles, like 
a hedgehog. He serves notice in his preface that 
he doesn't care two straws what we may say of 
him, and that he proposes to go his own lonely way 
in spite of us. This we are entirely willing he 
should do, so long as he will continue to give us 
papers as fresh, suggestive, and stimulating as those 
in his present volume. Dr. Abbott is a writer of the 
tribe of Jeffries, Burroughs, White, excellent 
teachers all. Nature out-of-doors is his theme, and 
he has studied it closely and loves it well. Some of 
the titles are : " Frost Foliage," " A Morning in 
May," " My Elm-Tree Oriole," " Christmas Out of 
Doors," "In Deep, Dark Woods." There are 
twenty-three papers in all. The volume is one of 
the most tasteful of the smaller ones of the season, 
and contains nineteen charming illustrations in 
photogravure. 

A holiday edition of Bulwer Lytton's " Paul 
Clifford " is issued by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. 
At first blush the experiment seems a hardy one. 
But modern taste in fiction is capricious, and there 
is no counting on a public that reads E. P. Roe one 
day, Rider Haggard the next, and buys "Trilby" 
by the ton the day after. So it is altogether possible 
that Lord Lytton's stagey highwaymen, with their 
elaborate manners and high-flown language so 
different from our vulgar modern " sand-baggers " 
and low perpetrators of unromantic " hold-ups " 
may have one day more of moderate popularity. 
By the man of imagination, who prefers romance 
to verisimilitude in his fiction, " Paul Clifford " may 
still be read with relish. It is a little hard, perhaps, 
to accept nowadays a thief who says to his victim 



(while rifling his pockets): " Lie still, lie still, 
I beseech you ! All wise men are fatalists ; and no 
proverb is more pithy than that which says, ' What 
can't be cured must be endured.' Little, perhaps, 
do you think that you are performing one of the 
noblest functions of humanity " and so forth, for 
a quarter of a page. But Turpin was not Jesse 
James, and he seems, like the " Prince of Darkness," 
to have been " a gentleman." It must have been 
almost a pleasure to be robbed so genteelly. The pres- 
ent volume is a sizable one, presentably gotten up 
throughout, and embellished with etchings (including 
a profile portrait of the author) by Mr. W. H. Bick- 
nell after the designs of Mr. W. L. Taylor. The 
cover is of blue ribbed cloth stamped in gold. 
A less venturesome issue than the above is the same 
firm's holiday edition of Bulwer's ever readable 
" Strange Story," made up in uniform style with the 
" Paul Clifford," and illustrated by the same artists. 
Of the enthralling interest and weird motif of this 
strong novel, we need not speak. The new edition 
is likely to find favor. 

Miss Neltje Blanchan's " Birds that Hunt and are 
Hunted " (Doubleday & McClure Co.) is a work 
which we especially welcome, because it serves as 
a cogent pictorial tract in aid of the current crusade 
against a form of vandalism that has been causing 
the rapid disappearance of bird-life in the United 
States and Canada. People are now awakening to 
the fact that, owing mainly to the prevalence of a 
tasteless and really barbarous fashion in dress the 
most beautiful of our American birds are in immi- 
nent danger of extermination. As the writer of the 
preface to this volume observes, " It seems incred- 
ible that any woman in this enlightened and 
refined age could be induced to wear an ornament 
that has cost the life of so beautiful a creature as an 
egret, a scarlet tanager, or a Baltimore oriole." 
That such ornaments are worn is of course due to 
thoughtlessness rather than cruelty. The fashion 
endures because its barbarity and its deplorable 
results are not clearly apprehended by those who 
follow it. Therefore the fact should be brought 
home to the popular understanding, that every 
woman who parades the streets with her head-gear 
" decorated " with the spoils of these slaughtered 
innocents is an abettor and a supporter of the 
dreadful traffic that is fast robbing rural nature in 
this country of one of its rarest and sweetest 
charms. As long as there is a demand in the 
market for bright-plumaged birds for purposes of 
ornamentation, that demand will be supplied up 
to the point, of course, when the source of the supply 
is exhausted. That point is already almost reached 
in the case of several species of our loveliest feath- 
ered choristers, which, within the memory of many 
of us, used regularly in great numbers to herald the 
spring and gladden the Northern woods and mead- 
ows with their cheery tribute of color and song. A 
summer without birds would be like a spring with- 
out flowers ; and many of us have observed with a 
pang the gradual passing of bird-life in the Northern

States. Happily, public sentiment is now strongly 
roused on this subject. The surest way to promote 
this sentiment of bird love and bird protection is to 
study the birds. They can be studied most pleas- 
antly and conveniently with the aid of this attractive 
and accurate book. It contains forty-eight beauti- 
fully colored plates, by the aid of which alone any 
bird illustrated may be easily identified. The price 
of the volume is remarkably moderate, quality 
considered. Taken with its companion volume, the 
popular " Bird Neighbors," by the same author, it 
forms an excellent and fairly comprehensive popular 
ornithology and an always suitable Christmas gift 
especially for boy or girl. 

Of a decidedly " stunning" order are the attrac- 
tions offered in Messrs. E. II. Herrick & Co.'s three 
large oblong folio volumes of highly-colored draw- 
ings (selected from " Truth ") by Messrs. De 
Thulstrup, W. Gran ville Smith, C. H. Johnson, and 
other American illustrators. The volumes measure 
21x14 inches, and each is encased in a showily 
decorated box. It is not necessary to characterize 
these drawings at length, as the style of the artists 
represented, and the scope of the lively periodical 
from which the examples of their work are chosen, 
are tolerably familiar to all. The work of Messrs. 
De Thulstrnp and Smith, especially, is quite clever 
in its way. These gentlemen have taken, in the 
main, the ways and doings of the New York " smart 
set " and their followers for their province, and the 
mirror they hold up is a true one. The " up-to-date " 
flavor of these showy volumes will doubtless com- 
mend them to the many who make that quality the 
test of merit. 

The instructive publication entitled " Historic 
Towns of New England " (Putnam) does not in 
strictness fall within the present category. But its 
pleasing variety of content and 'liberal pictorial 
attractions serve to make it a suitable and accepta- 
ble gift-book, especially for a friend of " Yankee " 
extraction, whose early memories are cradled in one 
of the towns " described. The volume is edited 
by the Rev. Lyman P. Powell, and it has for its 
special purpose the presentation of a connected ac- 
count of the more important events in the history 
of the towns selected for description. These towns 
are : Portland, Rutland, Salem, Boston, Cambridge, 
Concord, Plymouth, the Cape Cod Towns, Deerfield, 
Newport, Providence, Hartford, New Haven. Each 
sketch has been entrusted to a writer specially qual- 
ified for the task. Mr. S. T. Pickard leads off with 
the story of Portland ; then come, in order, as above, 
Edwin D. Mead, George D. Latimer, T. W. Hig- 
ginson and E. E. Hale, S. A. Eliot, F. B. Sanborn, 
Ellen Watson, Katharine Lee Bates, etc. An inter- 
esting general Introduction is supplied by George 
Perry Morris, who discusses New England towns 
and town life, and incidentally makes it clear that 
in his opinion the New England type of character 
stands for something very exalted indeed in the his- 
tory of the progress of the race. Mr. Morris at times 
reminds one a little of the New England gentleman 



who, in a burst of generous enthusiasm over the 
genius of Shakespeare, went so far as to declare 
that " Boston had probably not produced above ten 
men who were equal to him." The volume is a 
comely octavo, well printed on lightly glazed paper, 
and containing 148 illustrations, the subjects of 
which are judiciously selected. 

In the publication of old favorites in fresh, comely, 
and inexpensive form, Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 
are well to the fore this season with their " Luxem- 
bourg Edition " of " Vanity Fair," " The Scottish 
Chiefs," " Ivanhoe," ** Jane Eyre," " The Cloister 
and the Hearth," " Corinne," and Irving's " Sketch- 
Book " and "Alhambra." Taking the first two 
works named above as samples of the whole, it must 
be said that they are remarkably well made in view 
of the very moderate price asked for them. The 
binding is neat, print and paper are all that could be 
expected for the money, and the illustrations are 
both plentiful and good. In '< The Scottish Chiefs " 
there are eighteen well chosen and nicely executed 
half-tone plates from photographs of storied Scottish 
views and buildings Loch Katrine, " Auld Brig 
<>' Doon," Cambus- Kenneth, Glenfinlas, Stirling 
Castle, etc. In the seventeen full-page illustrations 
of " Vanity Fair " Mr. Frank T. Merrill has done 
very well in the main. His Becky Sharp is accept- 
able, his Jos. Sedley is delightful, his Osborn the 
elder is capital, and his Lord Steyne is goatish and 
hateful enough in all conscience. Nobody, of course, 
could do pictorial justice to Dobbin. Thackeray's 
own drawings of him would answer as well for 
Noah Claypole ; and with Dobbin Mr. Merrill fails 
like the rest. His Rawdon Crawley is more like 
a Kentucky Colonel " than a London Guardsman, 

but we do not wish to seem captious, for Mr. 
Merrill, we repeat, has done well on the whole. In 
this very acceptable " Luxembourg Edition " each 
work is given complete in a single volume. 

The Century Co. send us their' customary brace 
of new volumes in their pretty "Thumb-Nail" series, 
the titles this season being " Poor Richard's Alma- 
nack " and The Cricket on the Hearth " both 
happy selections. The first is judiciously edited by 
Mr. Benjamin E. Smith, and is a really choice little 
product of book-making. Never, we think, has the 
homely and practical the peculiarly American 
philosophy of sagacious Ben. Franklin received so fit 
a setting. The little book is portable, and even pocket- 
able, and contains a frontispiece portrait of Franklin, 
and a facsimile of the first number of the Almanack, 
for the year 1733. Miss Blanche McManus's design 
for the stamped leather cover is particularly good. 

In the minds of many of us Mr. Joseph Jefferson 
is pleasantly identified with the character of " Caleb 
Plummer "; and we are glad to find that the Intro- 
duction to this edition of Dickens's little masterpiece 
is from the pen of that sterling American actor. Mr. 
Jefferson surmises that had Dickens known how good 
a play there was in " The Cricket on the Hearth " 
he would have dramatized it himself. Could he have 
foreseen how delightfully Mr. Jefferson would im-

personate the old toy-maker, he would certainly have 
done so. Either of these pretty booklets makes 
a dainty and irreproachable gift-book of the mod- 
ester sort. 

Messrs. Rand, McNally and Co. reprint, in an 
attractive volume entitled "Along the Bosphorus," 
a miscellaneous collection of papers, largely travel 
sketches, by Susan E. Wallace (Mrs. Lew Wallace). 
Their range and character are shown by the chapter 
headings " Lepers and Leprosy in the East," 
" A Trip to Hebron," '* House-keeping in Turkey," 
" In the Tower of Many Stories " (London Tower), 
" William Wetmore Story," " A Letter from Dres- 
den," " Florence Nightingale," "Two Days in West- 
minster Abbey," etc. Among the literary and 
epistolary odds and ends interspersed through the 
book is an amusing letter from General Wallace 
to a friend, describing his purchase of a dog in Lon- 
don as a present to the Sultan. The contents of the 
volume are too varied for general characterization ; 
and the same may be said of the pictures, which 
consist of an oddly assorted but interesting medley 
of views of historic sites and buildings, portraits, 
photographic prints of native " types," works of art, 
and what not. Mrs. Wallace is a lively and agree- 
able writer, and her fund of experience is rich and 
ample. The book possesses many elements of popu- 
larity, and its attractive exterior bespeaks for it its 
due share of attention. 

Much intelligent and conscientious labor is rep- 
resented in Miss Estelle M. Hurll's " Life of Our 
Lord in Art" (Houghton). The book is essentially 
a descriptive history of the art illustrating the inci- 
dents in the historic life of Christ, the accompanying 
plates being arranged in the authoritatively ap- 
proved chronological order of the events depicted- 
Symbolical and allegorical Christ art and the his- 
tory of Christ portraiture are omitted. The author's 
treatment of her theme is systematic throughout, a 
certain number of points in connection with each 
subject being uniformly set forth : the relation of 
the subject to the life and character of Christ ; the 
origin and history of its treatment in art; the 
reasons for its popularity or neglect ; its suitability 
for pictorial treatment; the traditional type of com- 
position, and possible variations ; and, lastly, a 
descriptive account of the leading representative 
pictures from the appearance of the subject in art 
down to present times. With a half-dozen excep- 
tions, every subject treated in the text is illustrated, 
sometimes by two pictures, making a total of 104 illus- 
trations. Of these, sixteen are full-page half-tone 
plates which present leading facts in the life of Christ ; 
the remainder are vignette drawings illustrating the 
minor incidents. The Old Masters are of course well 
represented in the list of plates ; and the modern 
schools have also their share of attention, pre- 
Raphaelitism in Holman Hunt, Millais, Burne- 
Jones, and Ford Madox Brown ; the German mys- 
tic realism in Fritz von Uhde ; while there are also 
examples of Eastlake, Hoffmann, Dore", etc. In 
selecting the pictures the necessity of presenting an 



historical series illustrative of the text has been 
mainly kept in view ; but esthetic considerations 
have not been slighted. On the whole, the work 
forms an instructive and attractive art-book of the 
solider type, being soberly conceived and soberly 
worked out. 

An illustrated volume of selections from Cole- 
ridge's poems forms this year's number of Mr. 
Andrew Lang's series of " Selections from the 
Poets " (Longmans). There is a rather lengthy in- 
troduction, mainly biographical, in Mr. Lang's hap- 
piest vein, and the selections (thirty-three pieces in 
all ) embody about all of Coleridge that most people 
have time or taste for nowadays. Mr. Lang does 
not attempt to " place " Coleridge, but he volunteers 
an answer to the question, " Why is he great ? " 
He is a great poet (says Mr. Lang, rather in the 
Coleridgean manner) " because every now and then 
he captures in verse that indefinable emotion which 
is less articulately expressed in music, and in some 
unutterable way he transports us into the world of 
dream and desire." The little book falls within 
the present category largely by virtue of Mr. Patten 
Wilson's capital drawings. There are eighteen of 
them, full-page plates in the pre-Raphaelite style. 
They are quaintly fancied, too vague, or generalized, 
to clash with one's ideals ; and even the more austere 
Coleridgean will hardly wish them away. 

Magazine readers who have laughed over Mr. 
Guy Wetmore Caryl's quaint versified renderings 
of old ^sopian favorites will be glad to find these 
funny productions reprinted in a handsome vol- 
ume entitled " Fables for the Frivolous " (Harper). 
There are twenty " Fables " in all, among them 
" The Ambitious Fox and the Unapproachable 
Grapes," "The Arrogant Frog and the Superior 
Bull," The Urban Rat and the Suburban Rat," 
" The Sycophantic Fox and the Gullible Raven," 
and so forth. The turn of the author's humor may 
almost be guessed from his titles ; but we subjoin 
a specimen verse, taken from " The Unusual Goose 
and the Imbecile Woodcutter " that is, from the 
author's version of " The Goose that laid the Golden 
Eggs." It is Verse Number Two : 

" There was much affected rejoicing 

In the home of the woodcutter then, 
And his wife, her exuberance voicing, 

Proclaimed him most lucky of men. 
' 'Tis an omen of fortune, this gold egg,' 

She said, ' and of practical use, 
For this fowl doesn't lay any old egg, 

She 's a highly superior goose.' " 

The book is gotten up in suitable holiday style, and 
contains six illustrations by Mr. Peter Newell, one 
of the funniest of our pictorial fun-makers. 

We have so often commented on the work of 
Mr. Frederic Remington that a word or two of de- 
scription will suffice here for his new series of 
" Frontier Sketches " (The Werner Co.). The book 
is a flat oblong quarto bound in white vellum paper, 
and containing or, rather, consisting of, for there 
is no text save Mr. G. S. Rowe's short introductory 
fifteen rather elaborate drawings with such titles as

- Pursuing Geronimo," Indian Village Routed," 
-Sioux Warriors," "The Lame Deer Fight," 
Surrender of Chief Joseph," Indiana Firing the 
Prairie," etc. Altogether, the set is aa graphic and 
stirring as any that we have seen from Mr. Rem- 
ington's pencil. It vividly and truthfully presents 
some of the most exciting and characteristic epi- 
sodes of that wild drama now drawing to a close on 
our Western plains. We may say, incidentally, that 
Mr. Remington's style is agreeably chastened of late. 
It has lost none of its truth, but there is less of the 
superfluous bluntness of realism, more deference to 
the picturesque and the pleasing. In a word, Mr. 
Remington's style has grown mellower and more 
artistic, and when we say that, we do not mean 
more conventional. He is, too, as it seems to us, 
getting over his liking for grotesque " Muybridge " 
effects shown, for instance, in those amazing 
horses of his, comically humped up with their hoofs 
bunched under them, like Mr. Frost's funny dogs 
and jack-rabbits, or sprawling in air like a beetle 
dangled at the end of a string. We may be wrong, 
and an appeal to instantaneous photography might 
show that we are ; but we shall be slow to admit the 
" realism " of the equine contortions shown in some 
of Mr. Remington's pictures. From such eccentric- 
ities the plates in the present volume are unusually 
free. 

" Do-Nothing Days " (Lippincott) is a bouquet 
of a dozen little essays by Mr. Charles M. Skinner. 
We have known Mr. Skinner heretofore mainly as 
a compiler ; and we are now glad to have made his 
closer acquaintance through the medium of these 
crisp, familiar papers. Mr. Skinner takes a cheery 
view of life, and chats away confidentially on what- 
ever happens to turn uppermost in his mind, in the 
essayist's true style. There is no smell of the lamp 
in his pages, but there is a flavor of good reading. 
The chapters, aa he says, "have mostly thought 
themselves into words in hours of wandering or 
idleness." As a companion for such hours, the 
little volume will serve very acceptably. There are 
four dainty photogravures, and the very tasteful 
binding calls for special mention. 

A year or so ago we noticed favorably a little 
collection of American legends compiled by Mr. 
Charles M. Skinner. The kind reception accorded 
Mr. Skinner's first effort has encouraged him to go 
beyond the territory of the United States for ma- 
terial for a fresh collection ; and this material he 
now embodies in a small-sized but rather closely 
printed book of " Myths and Legends Beyond Our 
Borders" (Lippincott). About two-thirds of the 
collection are drawn from Canada, and the re- 
mainder from Mexico. There is much curious and 
suggestive matter in the volume, and it should not 
be neglected by students of folk-lore. There are 
four very attractive plates representing " Chapulte- 
pec," " The Church at Tadousac," " Medicine Hat 
Assiniboia," and << Popocatepetl." 

Mr. Frank T. Merrill is to be complimented on 
his clever illustration of Messrs. Crowell and Co.'s 



new two-volume edition of Dumas' " Twenty Years 
After." The eighteen plates are uniformly good, 
and show that Mr. Merrill knows hi- author. The 
edition is a good one throughout notably so, con- 
sidering the moderate price asked for it. The 
translation is made from the latent French edition, 
and is a marked improvement on the slipshod ver- 
sions through which so many English readers have 
become acquainted with this fascinating romance. 

An attractive and readable book, whose cheery 
content belies its dismal title, is Marion Harland's 
"Where Ghosts Walk" (Putnam). Drawing on 
her experiences abroad, Mrs. Terhune has written 
fifteen sprightly papers descriptive of places once 
the haunts of historic people such as Holy rood 
Palace, the Burns Cottage, Hampton Court Palace, 
The "Old Cheshire Cheese " Tavern, Byron's House 
at Ravenna, Saint Catherine's House at Florence, 
Madame Beck's House at Brussels, and so on. Five 
of the papers are reprinted from Harper's " Bazar." 
The book is illustrated with thirty-four plates, which 
are well selected and of good quality. Prospective 
tourists should find Mrs. Terhune's sketches useful 
and suggestive. 

Two trim little volumes of " Historical Tales " 
told by Mr. Charles Morris come to us from the 
Lippincott Co. The one volume embraces episodes 
from the history of Russia, such as the Fall of 
Novgorod the Great, the Conquest of Siberia, the 
Fall of the Strelitz, the Death-Struggle of Poland, 
the Nihilists and their Work, the Advance of Rus- 
sia in Asia, and so on ; the other volume contains 
tales from the history of China and Japan selected 
on the principle indicated in the foregoing li-t. 
There are about forty "Tales" to the volume, and 
each volume contains a dozen or eo full-page photo- 
graphic plates. Mr. Morris is well known as the 
author of a series of " Tales from the Dramatists," 
" King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table," 
etc., and he has shown his customary good judg- 
ment in the preparation of the present volumes. 
The stories are popularly told, and should especially 
interest and instruct younger readers. 

"The Old Chelsea Bun-House" (imported by 
Scribners), a tale of the last century, is a clever 
bit of literary mimicry and a charming picture of 
old times and old manners. The author has taken 
Goldsmith for his model, and he echoes him skil- 
fully. The story is told in the first person, and is 
put in the month of " Patty," a daughter of the 
keeper of the hostelry which gives the book its title. 
The tale opens with the visit of a party of ladies 
and gentlemen of "quality," who go up from the 
city to Chelsea by water. They amuse themselves 
alfresco after the conventionally frivolous and non- 
sensical manner of people of fashion (and to the 
grave disapproval of a serious and somewhat prig- 
gish " Mr. Fenwick," who eavesdrops from a neigh- 
boring window), and are served demurely from the 
Bun-House by " Mrs. Patty " and her sister. This 
introduces most of the dramatis persona;, and the 
story moves on thence smoothly and in the main

merrily to its conclusion. There is much lively 
dialogue and episode, and no plot to speak of or, 
rather, there is a medley of small plots arising out 
of the loves, jealousies, uneven fortunes, foibles, or 
cross-purposes of the rather numerous actors. The 
book is essentially a picture of eighteenth-century 
manners couched in eighteenth-century style ; and 
it is cleverly done. There are ten delightful illustra- 
tions by Messrs. John Jellicoe and Herbert Railton. 

Mrs. Annie Trumbull Slosson's popular character 
sketch of " Fishin' Jimmy " (Scribner), a book we 
like much in spite of its lachrymose ending, makes 
its appearance this season in attractive holiday 
garb, and with a dozen photogravures of fair quality 
by Miss Alice Barber Stephens. Print and paper 
are the best, and the modest cover is of grass-green 
linen with gilt side-stamp. Mrs. Slosson's book is 
redolent of the scents of brookside and meadow, 
and her portrait of the good old angler of Fran- 
conia is so sweet and true (so long as she sticks to 
portraiture) that one can only wonder when she 
stoops to the worn device of killing her hero off to 
slow music in the last chapter. 

The silly and offensive picture that appears on 
the cover and title-page of the volume containing 
Mr. Ch. Nelan's " Cartoons of Our War with Spain" 
(Stokes) does injustice to Mr. Nelan's often clever 
and incisive work. Mr. Nelan's cartoons are not 
mere pictorial buffonery. At their best they show 
a real grasp of the political situation treated, and 
their lesson is sound. The cartoon, in proper hands, 
is a potent instrument of popular instruction ; and 
it is fair to Mr. Nelan to say that a considerable 
portion of his work made distinctly for good when 
it appeared. For instance, there is the familiar 
drawing entitled " Keep Your Head Cool," repre- 
senting " Uncle Sam " trying to repress his rising 
anger against Spain (in spite of the stings of vari- 
ous journalistic mosquitoes), while some sensible 
person holds a block of ice, labelled "Common 
Sense," to his head, and another cools his heated 
brow with the fan of "Judgment." Naturally, the 
series of plates grows rather more truculent and 
"jingoistic" with the progress of events ; but they 
are always clever and seldom coarse. Mr. Nelan 
was one of the best of the Spanish War cartoonists, 
and this volume forms a suggestive and striking 
souvenir of the period. 

The second volume of " Historic New York " 
(Putnam) contains twelve of the interesting " Half 
Moon" series of descriptive and reminiscential pa- 
pers on Old New York, with the scope and aim of 
which our readers are already familiar. The pub- 
lication is a worthy one of considerable historic 
value. The contents of this volume comprise : 
" Slavery in Old New York," by Edwin V. Morgan ; 
"Tammany Hall," by Talcott Williams; "Old 
Prisons and Punishments," by Elizabeth D. Lewis ; 
"The New York Press," by Charlotte M. and Ben- 
jamin E. Martin ; " Bowling Green," by Spencer . 
Trask ; " Old Family Names," by Berthold Fernow; 
" Old Taverns and Posting Inns," by Elizabeth B. 



Cutting ; " Early Schools and Schoolmasters of New 
Amsterdam," by Emma Van Vechten; and so on. 
There are thirty-two illustrations, with maps, curious 
facsimiles, etc. The volumes are neatly got up, 
and the work evidences on the whole the serious 
purpose and the special competency of its contrib- 
utors. 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

L 

The question, " But is it true ? " is the one most 
familiar on the lips of a child, and sometimes most diffi- 
cult to answer. And it may be out of generosity to the 
harrassed and bewildered parent, that so many writers of 
juvenile books give their stories a foundation in fact. The 
motive is of doubtful value, however, for a story which 
is half true is much more likely to be essentially false 
than one woven entirely by the imagination. Facts must 
be first understood before they can be made truths. And 
one must be either an artist or a philosopher to make the 
perspective accurate. Unfortunately, most of the writ- 
ers of the present group of holiday books cannot be 
described by either term, and it is safe to say that many 
of the facts they record would not recognize themselves 
even as possibilities. Yet we elders complacently rejoice 
in being able to dispense history to our boys in these 
sugar-coated pills. Some of them certainly are harm- 
less enough, and others may even be mildly nutritious; 
but as mental tonic or stimulant, they are rarely effec- 
tive. The dose of history contained in them is decidedly 
homo3opathic. 

Of the few children's books of this season which pro- 
claim themselves to be history unadulterated, a new 
edition of Charles Dickens's " Child's History of Eng- 
land " (Houghton) may be taken with most confidence. 
This work is written with such spirit as to belittle the 
more labored chronicles, and to show that training in 
writing is not amiss even for a child's book. This most 
recent edition is embellished with many reproductions 
of excellent photographs by Mr. Clifton Johnson. They 
represent, as they exist to-day, the castles and fields and 
towns where famous deeds were done : a long and 
interesting journey to take in one's library chair. To 
look through Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth's " Story of 
America" (Werner) means a shorter journey, but a 
more fatiguing one, because the assistance is so much 
more meagre. For this new edition the text has been 
revised by the author, who has added some chapters 
about the more picturesque events of the Spanish war. 
Founded upon McKenzie's history of the United States, 
the narrative is simple and written with some force. 
The illustrations, some of them taken from quaint old 
engravings, are more interesting than beautiful. But 
Mr. Butterworth gives his readers credit for more intelli- 
gence than Mr. Eldridge S. Brooks does in his " True 
Story of Benjamin Franklin " (Lothrop). So familiar 
and conversational a style as his seems unnecessary even 
for very little children. Yet the story of Franklin cannot 
be told too early or too often, and this gossipy biogra- 
phy, with its many good pictures, may serve to introduce 
the man and his achievements to some children who 
would be bored by a more connected and rational account. 
The story of Franklin's life, with its rapid and brilli- 
ant transitions, is hardly less romantic than are the biog- 
raphies one finds in Mr. F. R. Stockton's " Buccaneers 
and Pirates of Our Coasts" (Macmillan). But these char-

acters have more spice in them, and their adventures 
give Mr. Stockton abundant excuse for the display of his 
peculiar and delightful talent. The effort to tell the 
truth about these artists in piracy has not prevented him 
from describing them gaily and with a kind of amused 
sympathy. The book is serious enough, but there are 
illuminating flashes of Mr. Stockton's dry humor. It is 
this quality in him which makes the work sane and 
wholesome, and helps him to model his bold buccaneers 
in the round. They are delightful, these spirited dash- 
ing figures; and though Mr. Stockton knocks off some 
of the romance which has gathered about them, there 
is enough left to bewitch any number of naughty little 
boys. The individuality of the book is reflected in the 
capital pictures by Mr. George Varian and Mr. B. West 
Clinedinst. The charm of this book is rivalled only by 
one other in this group, and that is " The Story of Marco 
Polo " (Century Co.) which Mr. Noah Brooks has edited 
and arranged for the young. It is hardly necessary to 
say that the great Venetian traveller named was the first 
to penetrate the Orient and to bring back to the aston- 
ished Europeans tales of the civilizations of Asia. The 
stories then disbelieved have been proved true by later 
explorers, and it is pleasant to hear them told by this 
intelligent and alert young investigator, to whom every- 
thing was new. Mr. Brooks has done his work well, 
retaining the flavor of the original work, and connecting 
his long quotations from it merely with the necessary 
details, briefly and clearly expressed. The pictures, 
by Mr. Will H. Drake, add to the extraordinary, quaint 
charm of the book. Mr. Clinton Ross deals with quite 
another time and other peoples in " Heroes of onr War 
with Spain " (Stokes), and gives a vivid impression of 
the valorous deeds that were done this summer by our 
heroes on land and sea. There is no lack of material 
here to stir the blood and fire the imagination of youth; 
and the author has handled it in a spirited and effective 
way. 

The other books in this group are more or less diluted 
with fiction. In some of them the color of the original 
facts is entirely lost in the mixture, but there are a few 
from which one can derive some idea of the real situ- 
ation, some picture of other times and customs. The 
greater number of them deal with the United States and 
its various conflicts, but only one writer has been enter- 
prising enough to take up the recent events. The Revo- 
lution keeps up its record for popularity, but three or four 
books take us as far back as the French and Indian war, 
and one even goes back to the Mayflower. Mr. Hezekiah 
Butterworth has bad the courage for the latter foray, and 
in " The Pilot of the Mayflower " ( Apple ton) he brings 
in all the events known to have happened during that 
famous voyage. The pilot is made to tell these stories, 
and if he could not add to our respect for the Pilgrim 
Fathers he increases our knowledge of their difficulties. 
The book ends with the first Thanksgiving Day in the 
colony. Not many years intervene before the point 
where Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith takes up the theme, 
in " The Young Puritans in King Philip's War " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.), wherein she shows our modern warriors 
how their forefathers fought. Mrs. Smith knows the 
Connecticut Valley thoroughly, and she puts something 
into her story which no stranger to it could compass. 
Her familiarity with its beauty makes for warmth and 
picturettqueness in this narrative of the conflict of races 
over its golden meadows. She uses the quaint speech 
of the early Puritans with good effect, and her descrip- 
tion of the Deerfield Massacre and the events that led 



up to it is simple and vivid. It is entirely from the 
standpoint of the settlers, of course: it would be a pleas- 
ant relief to find a story of these wars from tin- Indian 
point of view. Mr. James Otis has written two books 
about the period just before the Revolution. " When 
Israel Putnam served the King " (Rates) gives the story 
of an old man who had fought under Gem-nil Put in m 
when he was a Major and served the King. He wishes 
to prove to a new-fangled soldier that men in those days 
knew something about fighting and its hardships and 
glory, and he leaves him in no doubt of their courage and 
endurance. " The Charming Sally " ( Houghtou), by 
the same author, is longer and more carefully worked up. 
The title is taken from the name of a privateer schooner 
which, in 1765, had an active part in the resistance to the 
Stamp Act. The movements of three boys who join its 
crew are the focus of the plot, and the most exciting part 
of the story describes their perilous adventures in carry- 
ing the ship's guns, concealed in a load of hay, to the dock. 
Mr. Otis's boys are good and lively specimens, and they 
make things move at a rapid pace. The book is notice- 
ably well printed and bound, and the pictures, by Mr. 

W. S. Lukeus, are good Mrs. . Everett Green's 

"French and English" (Nelson), is a well-constructed 
and vivid story of the terrible struggle which ended on 
the heights of Quebec. It is unusual, in that it gives both 
sides of the picture ; and the figure of Montcalm, as shown 
here, is not less dignified and noble than that of Wolfe. 
It is a very large canvas, however, that the writer tries 
to cover, and the persons of her play are so numerous 
as to be a bit bewildering. She differentiates them well, 
however, and gives one the horrors of war as well as its 
tinselled glory. 

The number of books about the Revolution shows 
where the heart of our youth really is, and may do its 
part toward postponing that alliance with England of 
which we have been talking. It is difficult to affect a 
prejudice which is born and nurtured in our earliest 
youth. And it takes more courage than the average 
writer possesses, to be just to the redcoats in such a 
book as Mr. Edward Stratemeyer's " Minute Boys of 
Lexington " (Kates); and probably, if he were just, the 
volume would remain indefinitely on the counter. As it 
is, there are few boys who can read the book without 
wishing that his lot had been cast in Lexington in so 
happily exciting a time. The style of the book is rather 
diffuse and discursive, but the matter has a thrill in it. 
And the two boys in blue and buff uniforms on the 
cover are themselves fascinating. Mr. Everett T. 
Tomlinsou's second series of " Stories of the American 
Revolution" (Lee & Shepard) bears a more direct re- 
lation to history than most of these books. He has 
selected some of the less familiar heroic episodes in the 
war, and written them up in the form of fiction, with 
the sugar-coating which is considered necessary. They 
are pleasant enough to read, however, and some of them 
tell of the quiet, unapplauded deeds of heroism which 
are the most difficult of all. The same author has 
written a story of Washington's campaign in New 
Jersey in 1778, under the title of " The Boys of Old 
Monmouth " ( Houghtou). Much responsibility is thrown 
upou its hero by bis discovery that his own foster- 
father is working against the cause of the patriots, and 
his attempts to circumvent him bring many adventures. 
The battle of Monmouth is the climax of the book, and 
Lee's disobedience of orders a large part of the theme. 
Still another book by Mr. Tomlinson relates to Bur- 
goyne's invasion, and is called " Two Young Patriots "

(Wilde). It ends with the defeat of the British gen- 
eral; but though the author aims at truth in his de- 
scriptions, he altogether misses the vivid picturesque- 
ness which would carry the situation home to us. Miss 
Mary B. Sheldon's " One Thousand Men for a Christ- 
mas Present " (Estes) has a cover attractive enough to 
atone for its cumbersome title. It is a vivid little tale 
of the encampment near Trenton and the crossing of 
the Delaware, ending with the capture of the city and 
a thousand Hessian prisoners. Mr. Charles Ledyard 
Norton's " A Soldier of the Legion " (Wilde) begins 
with the Revolution and makes its boy heroes witness 
the surrender at Yorktown. But it carries them far 
beyond that event, and describes their experience as 
pioneers in the great Northwest. The boys are William 
Henry Harrison, who became President, and Sergeant 
Bassett, his faithful attendant, who is supposed to write 

the book Two of these Revolutionary books make 

one conscious for the first time that girls were alive 
during that period. One's attention had been given so 
exclusively to boys that such a possibility was not recog- 
nized. It is with a pleased surprise, therefore, that 
one takes up " A Girl of '76 " (Wilde), by Miss Amy E. 
Blanchard. The little heroine's interest in politics be- 
gins with the Boston tea-party, and though the book 
deals largely with more frivolous things than battles, 
the war is always in the background. The author tries, 
with some success, to show what a girl's life was at that 
time. There are plenty of people in the book, but there 
is not much life, and it drifts into sentimentality at the 
end, the usual course with books for girls. The senti- 
ment is handled much better in Margaret Sidney's 
"Little Maid of Concord Town" (Lothrop), but it 
is present nevertheless. Yet the story has a charm which 
brings it nearer to life and makes the love-affairs a bit 
more pardonable. It is full of action, but it has form, 
and the characters are simple and genuine. 

Mr. Kirk Munroe has actually found a new subject 
in his tale of the American navy, called " In Pirate 
Waters " (Scribner). He places his hero in the squad- 
ron sent to the Mediterranean, in 1803, to subdue the 
Barbary pirates. The combination of the familiar and 
the foreign makes this a capital subject, and Mr. Munroe 
has a practised hand in the construction of a boy's book. 
The result is one of the liveliest and most entertaining 
historical stories of the year. The war of 1812 is cel- 
ebrated by Mr. James Otis, in "The Cruise of the 
Comet" (Estes). Mr. Otis has made a book out 
of the letters written by a boy, Stephen Burton, who 
was on board the privateer " Comet," which sailed from 
Baltimore in 1812. They are written in a simple and 
vigorous style, which is very effective. It would be a 
dull boy who would not be excited by Stephen's story 
of the British prisoners who managed to free themselves 
and tried to capture the ship. It is to the Civil War 
that Captain Charles King gives his attention in " From 
School to Battlefield" (Lippincott), and he does it in a 
brisk and thoroughgoing fashion that must appeal to an 
energetic boy. The persons in his story have the air 
of being real boys, and they find some spirited adven- 
ture in General McClellan's army, where boys were 
evidently made useful. The book has the advantage of 
some clever pictures by Miss Violet Oakley. Mr. 
Warren Lee Goss also devotes himself to the Civil War 
in "In the Navy; or, Father against Son" (Crowell), 
and focuses his story in the battle between the Monitor 
and the Merrimac. Most of the action takes place on 
the rivers of Virginia and North Carolina, which were 



so useful to the blockade runners. The enterprising 
spirit of Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, who inaugurates the 
"Old Glory Series" (Lee & Shepard) with a book 
called " Under Dewey at Manila," is much more com- 
mendable than his literary form. The story has no 
construction, the method of handling it is jerky and 
discursive, and the style is bad. Moreover, the point 
of view is sentimental and false, and unintentionally the 

story belittles both the Commodore and his victory 

It is by a stretch of the imagination, perhaps, that 
" Cowmen and Rustlers " (Coates), by Mr. Edward S. 
Ellis, is entered in the list of historical tales. Yet it is 
a story of the Wyoming cattle ranges in 1892, and no 
war is more important or more picturesque than the 
development of the great Northwest. The theme of this 
story is the struggle with the " rustlers," or cattle- 
thieves, who became powerful for a time in Wyoming. 
The talk is stilted and the incidents are exaggerated 
beyond the bounds of probability, yet it is a pretty good 
story nevertheless. Fame and fortune await the man who 
will write the truth about this life and write it with art. 
America claims apparently the lion's share of the 
interest of her youth, yet this interest reaches out a 
little into the history of other lands, and it should cer- 
tainly travel far enough to take in the admirable book 
edited by Mr. George Laurence Gomme, entitled " The 
Queen's Story Book " (Longmans). This volume con- 
tains dramatic tales of English monarchs, collected from 
romantic literature. Sir Walter Scott and Thackeray 
furnish a number of them, Daniel Defoe wrote one, and 
others are taken from Sir Charles Napier, Froissart, 
Thomas Love Peacock, and Mary Wolstonecraf t Shelley. 
The result is just the kind of book to afford children 
vivid pictures of things it is well for them to know. 
Literature is just as good for a child as it is for a grown 
person, and twaddle is just as bad. This is a fact which 
cannot be repeated too often. And another, equally 
important, and ignored in the same unaccountable way, 
is that children like the real thing in literature better 
than they like the false. They are much more discrim- 
inating in matters of art than their elders fancy. Mr. 
Gomme's delightful book has an additional charm in 
the pictures by Mr. W. H. Robinson. Mr. Charles W. 
Whistler has written a story about the first English 
fleet in " King Alfred's Viking " (Nelson). It is founded 
upon the life of Alfred written by his chaplain Asser, 
but it consists chiefly of an account of the adventures 
of the Norsemen who were given charge of the King's 
fleet. It is a good story, and (what is more unusual) 
it is well written. One of the best books of the year 
gives part of the romantic story of the Black Prince. 
Mr. William O. Stoddard has put himself into the spirit 
of the thing, and he makes every right-minded boy long 
to follow that Red Dragon banner into the heart of the 
battle of Cre'cy. " With the Black Prince " (Appleton) 
should not be neglected Another well-written book, 
though one much less convincing, is Miss Ruth Hall's 
"In the Brave Days of Old" (Houghtou). It carries 
us down to the time of James the First, and opens at 
the death-bed of Elizabeth. The little hero rides, with 
his guardian, to take the news of this dramatic ending 
to the new king in Scotland. But this is only the be- 
ginning of his adventures, which carry him finally with 
Hudson to America, and make him one of the first set- 
tlers of Manhattan. We come down to Napoleon's 
time in Mr. Frank Cowper's " The Island of the En- 
glish " (Macmillan), though the Emperor himself does 
not appear. The emigres and their misfortunes are the

[Dec. 1, 



theme of the story, which is vividly told. It is dramatic, 
and handled in excellent fashion. One of Mr. 6. A. 
Henty's books," Under Wellington's Command " (Scrib- 
ner), deals with almost the same period. It is a story 
of the Peninsular War, in continuation of " With Moore 
in Corunna," and it takes up the history of Terence 

O'Connor at the battle of Salamanca Mr. Henty, still 

indefatigable, contributes two other books to the season's 
Christmas hilarity. One is a story of Hotspur and 
Glendower, called " Both Sides the Border" (Scrib- 
ner), and it would be bard to find a more fascinating 
subject. It might be still pleasanter, though, to read 
about it in Shakespeare. The third of this annual tri- 
umvirate relates to Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. "At 
Aboukir and Acre" (Scribner) gives the author a 
chance to glorify the English arms at the expense of 
an almost invincible conqueror. Mr. Henty's stories 
are too well known to need further description. He 
knows thoroughly well how to interest a boy in every 
page, and his style is spirited and good. The last book 
of this group is a story of the Maccabees, written by 
Miss Charlotte M. Yonge, whose following is large. 
In " The Patriot* of Palestine " (Thomas Whittaker) 
she tries to give an idea of the real career of Maccabeus 
and bis brother Eleazer. It is an unfamiliar part of 
Jewish history, and if Miss Yonge cannot make it live 
for us, she can at least suggest it. But the names and 
something in the manner make it a bit heavy for children. 
After so much serious literature, a little excursion 
into the land of fancy may be refreshing even to the 
big boys who outwardly scorn such frivolity. The pic- 
ture books, the fairy tales, and the nursery rhymes 
make a rather interesting group this year. And artis- 
tically the honors are divided. In literature they go to 
"W. V.'s Golden Legend" (Dodd), and to the new 
edition, in one volume, of " The Invisible Playmate " 
and " W. V. Her Book " (Dodd), both by the same 
author, Mr. William Canton. The latter book was rec- 
ognized, on its first appearance, as one of the most ten- 
der and lovely pictures of child-life that have ever been 
written. The "Golden Legend," with its admirable 
pictures by Mr. T. H. Robinson, would have interest 
for as if only because it was " W. V.'s." But in itself 
there is an exquisite beauty. It is made up of tales of 
the saints and martyrs, told as a poet might tell them 
to a child he loved. He makes these austere heroes 
more fascinating than fairies, more beautiful than 
princesses, and very human. Yet he is true to the 
spirit of the simple old legends, and the hidden signifi- 
cance of them becomes visible in his hands. We rec- 
ognize the great truths in character, the great lessons 
in conduct, which underlie them. But these are never 
obtruded, and the first and last impression is of beauty. 
In art, the honors are carried off conspicuously by 
" An Alphabet of Animals " (imported by Scribner), 
in which Mr. Carton Moore Park takes rank with the 
cleverest painters of animals. The weather-beaten nags 
which appear upon the cover are alone enough to prove 
his artistic skill, but they lead us into a land where 
the most strange and enchanting creatures become our 
familiar friends. There is nothing superficial in Mr. 
Park's knowledge of these animals; he knows them as 
Barge knew them, with an intense sympathy for their 
characteristic peculiarities and uglinesses. There is 
humor in many of his drawings, but it has a deep serious- 
neas to support it. And this is all expressed in terms 
of art. It is a book that will delight children and col- 
lectors, and drive artists to despair Mr. Kemble's 



humor in " Comical Coons " (Russell) is more obvious. 
He exaggerates his types as he does his situations, but he 
does it consistently, and his mules and little dogs are as 
funny as his pickaninnies. Occasionally he forces his 
mirth a little, and this book is less genuine than others 

he has given us. Yet his darkies are still irresistible 

Mr. Henry Bradford Simmons's "Jingle Jangle Rhyme 
Book " (Stokes) is pure farce. Once or twice only does 
it achieve real fun, but everywhere else the effort is pain- 
fully apparent. The pictures are printed in colors which 
would be good if only an artist had combined them. 
Crudity is evidently the intention. Mr. Simmons prob- 
ably dare not be as artistic as be could. Miss S. Rosa- 
mund Praeger continues some adventures begun last year 
in "Further Doings of the Three Bold Babes" (Long- 
mans). By means of a gentle and obliging sea-serpent, 
which curls itself into a tubular bridge for their con- 
venience, they are enabled to enter the kingdom of the 
Head-hoppers. It is a realm which very little people 
will find amusing. For their benefit also was con- 
structed The Golliwogg at the Sea-Side " (Longmans), 
with pictures by Miss Florence K. Upton and verses by 
Miss Bertha Upton. No particular cleverness is wasted 
upon it, however, and the pictures of these jointed dolls 
are almost as wearisome as the rhymed narrative of their 
experience. Mr. J. L. C. Booth's " Sporting Rhymes 
and Pictures " (Russell) is for older and wiser children. 
The rhymes are gay and spirited, and the pictures have 
a great deal of life in them. There is character enough 
and to spare in both men and horses, and the artist has 
a refreshing keen sense of humor. We are all young 
again for an hour with " Jack the Giant Killer " (Mac- 
millan), as he appears in the series of Mr. Hugh Thom- 
son's illustrated fairy-books in paper covers. It is a 
good old-fashioned story with pictures of the right sort. 
These are just the kind of giants to give dreams to the 
old and nightmares to the young. " Nursery Tales," 
(Russell) is a series of paper dolls, made ready to cut 
out from the pages. They illustrate " Mother Goose " 
rhymes. 

A book of really delightful ballads is hard to find, but 
when one lights upon such a one as " Down Durley Lane, 
and Other Ballads" (Century) it should kindle joy and 
merriment in the adults who read them and in the chil- 
dren who listen. Miss Virginia Woodward Cloud has 
a sense of humor which cannot leave one serious, and 
a sense of rhythm which makes her verses sing in the 
brain. So happy a combination could not fail to make 
a charming book, even without the assistance of Mr. 
Reginald Birch's clever and amusing pictures, in which 
we find a full appreciation of the delicacy of Miss Cloud's 
satirical character study. The ingenuity of Mr. Andrew 
Lang has evolved a new kind of child's book: new 
because it is so old. He edits " The Nursery Rhyme 
Book " (Frederick Warne & Co.), with a rather whim- 
sical preface explaining the historical origin of some 
of the verses. He groups the rhymes according to sub- 
ject, but further than that be is wise enough not to edit 
them. All the dear old verses that we knew and loved 
in " Mother Goose " are here, and some others that are 
less familiar. With the capital drawings by Mr. L. Leslie 

Brooke the volume is a delightful one Charles and 

Mary Lamb's " Poetry for Children," now reprinted by 
the Macmillan Co., is an odd contrast to the modern 
child's verse. In comparison with Stevenson and William 
Canton, it is curiously dull and heavy and old-fashioned. 
Yet for the sake of the quaint and charming colored 
pictures by Miss Winifred Green, which embellish this

edition, it is possible that even Lurried modern children 
will stop long enough to read some of the stiff old verses. 

It is not inappropriate to head the list of fairy tales with 
" Stories from Dante " ( VVarne), for no one knew better 
than he the poetic value of such creatures of the imagi- 
nation. Miss Norley Chester retells these stories from 
the Divine Comedy with clearness and simplicity. It is 
not an easy task to reduce such poems to terms of prose, 
and much is necessarily lost in the process. Yet Miss 
Chester is successful in making her book interesting to 
children, though she writes down to them a little too 
obviously; and it is a fine thing to stimulate their curi- 
osity in regard to so great a poem. Another useful and 
instructive book, which is at the same time nourishing 
to the imagination, is Zenaide A. Ragozin's version 
of "Siegfried and Beowulf" (Putnam). The author 
is one who knows her subject as a scholar, and has the 
skill and imagination to construct her stories admirably. 
Her style is terse and vivid, well adapted to interest 
the young in these dignified and thrilling tales. Mr. 
Andrew Lang, not satisfied with having exhausted all the 
colors of the rainbow for his fairy-books, has this year 
wandered into the far East and selected and edited for 
children " The Arabian Nights Entertainments " (Long- 
mans). Mr. Lang possesses a magician's wand to con- 
jure up the kind of stories that children love, and this 
book will be irresistible to the imaginative, for whom the 
invisible world is the real one. Mr. Lang has shortened 
some of the stories and omitted those " only suitable for 
Arabs and old gentlemen." The translations are from 
Galland's version, and are well made. They are illus- 
trated with many good pictures by Mr. Ford. 

Mr. Ernest Seton Thompson's delightful book called 
" Wild Animals I have Known " (Scribner) cannot be 
classified easily. It has much of the character of fable, 
yet these sketches are accurate, and belong to history 
quite as legitimately as some other books devoted to the 
glorification of man. Mr. Thompson's long and scientific 
study of animals and their ways, together with his skill 
as a writer, enables him to give these biographies of cer- 
tain intelligent animals with the precision of a scientist 
and the vividness of a novelist. The grim tragedy of Lobo 
the wolf fascinates the attention as securely as though he 
had been born a leader of men instead of a leader of beasts. 
And the dramatic intensity of the story of the pacing 
mustang and his suicidal leap for freedom has not been 
equalled in its kind outside of "The Jungle Book." 
Curiously enough, Mr. Thompson has illustrated his 
book as well as he has written it. There is as much 
artistic quality in the pictures as there is character, and 

the little sketches in the margins are delightful Mr. 

Thompson has also illustrated another book on natural 
history, which Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright has prepared 
for youthful readers. A thread of lively and entertaining 
narrative binds together the series of animated sketches 
of the principal mammals of this continent, in her " Four- 
Footed Americans and their Kin " (Macmillan). The 
favorable impression created among all lovers of field 
and woodcraft by Mrs. Wright's " Citizen Bird " will 
insure a most cordial reception to this companion volume. 
Judged, however, upon its own merits, it deserves com- 
mendation for its accuracy and completeness, as well as 
for its fascinating style, and for the fund of information 
which it contains regarding the familiar, and many unfa- 
miliar, animals of this country. It is an ideal book for 
children, and doubtless older folk will find in its pages 
much of interest to them about rats and muskrats, hares 
and rabbits, minks, martens, and ermines, caribou, moose, 



and elk, dolphins and manatees, and bats, moles, and 
shrews. The book has been edited by Mr. Frank M. 
Chapman. The ethics of sport and the relations of ani- 
mals to man and his ways are touched upon in a whole- 
some and sensible manner. Much natural history is 
included, also, in Mr. Ernest Ingersoll's " Book of the 
Ocean " (Century), but it has still more physical geogra- 
phy. The plant and animal life of the ocean are made 
a kind of appendix to man's dealings with the sea. The 
book covers a wide range of interesting subjects, from 
waves and tides, and the building of ships, to naval 
battles, robbers of the sea, yachting and fishing. It is 
admirably written and copiously illustrated; the best 
kind of a book for a boy who loves the sea. 

It is a whimsical assortment of impossibilities that 
one finds in Mr. Walter Douglas Campbell's " Beyond 
the Border" (Russell). The story of "Joke or No 
Joke," with the king's ludicrous pursuit of a forgotten 
jest, is funny for all of us. The thing moves with a 
rush, and cleverly leaves one stranded at the end. There 
is another story of a wise king who could not tell how 
many beans made five, and who ordered the omission of 
the letter P from the alphabet because he could not 
pronounce it, with melancholy consequences to his obe- 
dient subjects, whose food consisted largely of pumpkin 
porridge. , Such vagaries form the basis of an amusing 
book, whose fun is too lively and spontaneous to seem 
forced. There is less of gayety in Mr. Albert Bigelow 
Paine's "The Hollow Tree" (Russell), but there is a 
good deal of quiet humor. The stories of the coon, the 
possum, and the crow, who lived in the hollow tree, are 
told to the Little Lady in the House of Many Windows. 
And they are told very daintily and gracefully. It is 
the kind of thing that " Uncle Remus " has done su- 
premely well, and it is a little hazardous for another to 
try the same experiment. Yet Mr. Paine's style is so 
good that his book can stand on its own merits. The 
pictures, by Mr. J. M. Conde", are delightful, sketchy, 
full of character, and amusingly satirical. They alone 
are worth the price of admission. The same thing 
might be said for Miss Rosie M. M. Pitman's drawings 
for " The Magic Nuts " (Macmillan), though they are 
less artistic than her illustrations for " Undine " last 
year. Mrs. Molesworth writes the book, and her loqua- 
city makes one wonder at her popularity. Yet the story 
of the little English girl who finds herself in the country 
of fairies when she goes to Germany, is rather pretty. 
It is one of those harmless inventions which do not tax 
the imagination of the writer or of the reader. Much 
more ingenuity was required in the production of Mr. 
Clement Fezandie^s " Through the Earth " (Century) . 
The author seems to have followed Jules Verne and over- 
taken him. The construction of a tunnel through the 
earth for the transference of freight and passengers from 
Australia to New York is the basis of the plot; and it 
is ingenious enough to keep one excited over the develop- 
ments. It is given the illusion of truth, also, and in spite 
of glaring impossibilities one is carried along by the 
apparent frankness of the narrative. Mr. H. Escott- 
Inman's " The Owl King, and other Fairy Stories " 
(Warne) is a much more old-fashioned book. Here are 
no modern scientific problems, no exasperating machin- 
ery to go wrong at the critical moment. Here are, rather, 
bosky dells and sunlit meadows inhabited by fairies and 
pixies who are wise enough to thwart the wicked witch 
and make everything come out happily in the end. The 
talking flowers and elves and princesses are prettily 
described and will please the little people vastly.

[Dec. 1, 



LITERARY Noras. 

An Epitome of Human Histology," by Dr. Arthur 
W. Weytte, is published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. publish a pretty reprint of 
Miss Burney's "Evelina," with illustrations by Mr. 
Arthur Raokham. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish a new edition 
of " The Man without a Country," for which Dr. Hale 
has written a special introduction apropos of the late 
war with Spain. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish " A Short 
History of England " and " A Short History of the 
United States," both by Miss Mary Platt Parmele, and 
both designed for elementary students. 

A translation of " The Children's Crusade," by M. 
Marcel Schwob, with an introduction by Mr. Henry 
Copley Greene, is published in one of the prettiest of 
booklets by Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. 

Hellenica," edited by Mr. Evelyn Abbott, has now, 
after eighteen years, gone into a second edition, in 
which, however, but few and slight changes from the 
original have been made. Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. are the publishers. 

Messrs. R. F. Fenno & Co. publish a new edition of 
"John Jasper's Secret," which, as most readers have 
by this time probably forgotten, is the sequel to Dickens' 
" Edwin Drood," prepared by Charles Dickens the 
younger and Wilkie Collins. 

Besides the editions of " Cyrano de Bergerac " re- 
cently reviewed by us, the Doubleday & McClure Co. 
have just put forth what they call an edition de luxe of 
Miss Gertrude Hall's translation. Half a dozen photo- 
gravure illustrations are the added feature of this 
edition. 

Mr. Edward Robeson Taylor's translation of the 
"Sonnets of Jose'-Maria de He're'dia," published by Mr. 
William Doxey, has gone into a second edition, in which 
the translator has profited by the criticisms made upon 
the former edition, and made many changes for the 
better. 

The Rev. Henry Van Dyke's study of The Poetry 
of Tennyson " seems to have taken a permanent place 
(which it deserves) in our critical literature. The edi- 
tion before us(for which a new preface has been written) 
is the tenth, and is published by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons. 

Professor E. A. Grosvenor of Amherst has translated 
Duray's A General History of the World," revised it 
to date (with the addition of supplementary chapters), 
and published the work in a volume of nearly eight 
hundred pages, with many maps, through Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. 

" My Lady Sleeps " is the title of a small anthology 
made by Mrs. Katherine S. Page, and published by 
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., Boston. The subject is the 
poetry of sleep, with subdivisions devoted to "dreams," 
" rest," and " bedtime songs." Titian's familiar head 
of the sleeping Venus appropriately adorns the cover 
of this pretty volume. 

Theodore Sedgwick Fay, who died in Berlin on the 
twenty-fourth of November, was the oldest American 
man of letters. Born in 1807, he bad reached the great 
age of ninety-one. He was associated with Willis and 
Morris in the editorship of the New York " Mirror," 
and afterwards became Secretary of Legation and 



American Minister in Berlin. He lived in Berlin from 
his retirement in 1861 to his death. His publinhed 
books were numerous, in fiction, poetry, travel, essays, 
and history, but " Norman Leslie " is the only one of 
them that became widely known, and the only one that 
now enjoys even a precarious life. 

Mr. Stephen DowelPs " Thoughts and Words " is a 
collection of elegant extracts and favorite passages 
from the world's literature, done up into three volumes, 
bound in vellum, and almost sumptuous in their execu- 
tion. The extracts are in several languages, and ex- 
hibit good, if somewhat capricious, taste. Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. are the publishers. 

A sale of rare old English books will be held Dec. 12 
and 13 at 186 Wabash Ave., Chicago, by Messrs. Wil- 
liams, Barker & Severn. Among the gems of the collec- 
tion may be mentioned a folio set of John Ogilvie's 
"America," 1671, David Robert's "Views of the Holy 
Land," with original plates, 1842, and Akin's " Memoirs 
of the Court of Queen Elizabeth," 1819. 

The following text-books in science have recently 
been published : "Elementary Zoology" (Longmans), 
by Mr. Frank E. Beddard ; "A Manual of Chemical 
Analysis" (Longmans), by Mr. G. S. Newth ; "A Lab- 
oratory Manual of Physiological and Clinical Chem- 
istry and Toxicology" (Lamson), by Dr. A. E. Austin 
and Mr. Isador H. Coriat ; an " Elementary Botany " 
(Holt), by Mr. George F. Atkinson; and a " Psychology 
for Teachers" (Scribner), by Professor C. Lloyd 
Morgan. 

The volume entitled " American Prose," and edited 
by Mr. George Rice Carpenter, is prepared upon the 
plan of Mr. Craik's " English Prose," and really pro- 
vides that work with a supplementary volume. Twenty- 
five American authors, from Cotton Mather to Francis 
Parkman, are included, each having a brief critical essay 
by a competent authority. For example, Professor Norton 
writes of Lowell, Colonel Higginson of Thoreau, Mr. 
Howells of Curtis, and Mr. Fiske of Parkuian. The work 
is well done, and a real want satisfactorily supplied. 

The following text-books for teachers of English 
have been received : In the "Athenaeum Press " series 
(Ginn), there are "Selections from the Poetical Works 
of William Cowper," edited by Dr. James O. Murray, 
and " Selections from the Poems of Robert Burns," 
edited by the late John G. Dow. The same publishers 
send us DeQuincy's " Revolt of the Tartars," edited by 
Dr. William E. Simonds. An edition of "Gray's En- 
glish Poems," edited by Mr. D. C. Tobey, comes from 
the Cambridge University Press. Finally, Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. publish " Modern American Oratory," 
being seven representative orations, edited by Mr. Ralph 
Curtis Ringwalt. 

Volume XII. of " Book-Prices Current," edited by 
Mr. J. H. Slater, comes to us with the London imprint 
of Mr. Elliot Stock. Beginning with this volume, the 
record is made to end with September, instead of with 
December, as hitherto. Since this volume includes the 
greater part of the Ashburnham sale, it is even thicker 
than usual, in spite of the fact that it covers consider- 
ably less than a full year. The number of lots cata- 
logued is 33,763, and the total sum paid for them no 
leas than 92,857, a higher average price than UMIH!. 
The tales here reported are " the most important that 
have occupied the attention of the various auctioneers 
for at least ten years, while the prices realized have 
in many instances been phenomenal."

SEX WORSHIP: 

An Exposition of the Phallic Origin of Religion. 

(Second Edition.) 
By CLIFFORD HOWARD. 

The object of this work is to demonstrate that all 
religions have had a common origin, and are founded 
upon a natural, material basis the worship of life in 
its phenomena of creation and reproduction. 

The work includes a description of the beliefs and 
rites of the principal sex- worshipping nations of anti- 
quity, from which it would appear that our present 
theological creeds, as well as all of our most important 
church emblems and religious festivals (as the cross, 
altar, and wine, Christmas, Easter, etc.) were originally 
of sexual significance and were familiar features of 
religious worship thousands of years before the Chris- 
tian era.

lutely destitute of pedantry . . . the book, indeed, teems with 
additions to our knowledge, some minute, some of real valne.

HISTORY OF THE 

TO READERS OF " THE DIAL ": 

We make the following proposition to become members of 
the Review of Reviews History Club, and obtain the three 
volumes of 

Our War in Two Hemispheres 

By ALBERT SHAW, 

Editor of the "American Monthly Review of Reviews" and author of 
"Municipal Government in Great Britain," etc. 



T^VERY American citizen possessing a library, and many that do not possess 
J rf one, will be interested in the announcement of the history of the late war 
with Spain, now published by the Review of Reviews Company. Much of the 
narrative was written by Dr. Albert Shaw during the actual fighting of the sum- 
mer. This has been revised and amplified by him in the light of the official 
reports and documents which have only become available after hostilities ceased. 
A free quotation from the critical Congressional debates, and other public utter- 
ances at crucial periods, aids in making this work what it is, the standard refer- 
ence history of the decisive and successful struggle. But it is much more than 
a lively and comprehensive narrative. It goes back to the years of struggle in 
Cuba which prepared the way for the war ; it discusses energetically the problems 
which confronted the United States after the war as to the Philippines, Cuba, and 
Porto Rico ; and as a whole it forms a broadly conceived picture of the year which 
has seen America brought face to face with new world - duties. 

The important special and technical matters of the war period, generally dis- 
missed by the historian with only slight, and often insufficient, discussion, are 
fully and authentically dealt with in contributed chapters, written by men who had 
unusual opportunities for studying their subjects. Thus, the lessons which the 
war has for us as to the relative efficiency of rifles and machine guns are given in a 
carefully written chapter by Lieut. John H. Parker, of the United States Army. 
The military movements of the Santiago and Porto Rican campaigns are analy/< ! 
by the editor of the "Army and Navy Journal"; the battle with Cervera is 
described by the novelist, Winston Churchill, who is a graduate of the United 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



423 



SPANISH WAR 

States Naval Academy; the actual condition of Cuba before the war, and the 
facts which caused the war, are described by eye-witnesses, Murat Halstead and 
Stephen Bonsai. 

The illustration of the book is especially valuable in the hundreds of portraits, 
pictures of the navies, photographed scenes of the war, and the entertaining car- 
toons reproduced from Spanish, French, German, and English papers, as well as 
from the American. Some of the Spanish cartoons are fascinating, aside from 
their intrinsic humor, in their curious perversion of the actual conditions, and are 
valuable contributions to history in their graphic explanation of the fatuity which 
led to Spain's overthrow.

Only Two Dollars Down.

FORTUNE'S TANGLED SKEIN. 

By JEANNETTE H. WALWORTH. 12mo, cloth decorated, 
81.25. 

In this story of the fortunes of a Southern family the author has

all her writings. The unraveling of the mystery which subjects the 
hero to general suspicion of a crime discloses much ingenuity and com-

THE STORY OF THE REVOLUTION 

By HENRY CABOT LODGE 

With nearly 200 illustrations by Pyle, Yohn, Chapman, De Thulstrup, Clark, Peixotto, and others. 2 vols, large 8vo, $6.00. 
" Senator Lodge's book is the most important contribution to American Revolutionary history since the work of John Fiske. It is dignified 
in tone, but full of the spirit of '76, and permeated throughout by a patriotism which has no uncertain note. In his hands the familiar story 
of the Revolution reads like a new page in American history, and its presentation is so real and ao vital that it will be a long-lived and influ- 
ential book." New York Obterver. 

THE CUBAN AND PORTO RICAN CAMPAIGNS 

By RICHARD HARDING DAVIS. With 117 illustrations from photographs and drawings by eye witnesses, and with 4 maps. 

Crown 8vo, pp. 364, $1.50. 

The remarkable graphic and picturesque quality in Mr. Davis's narrative of the principal events in the recent war in 
Cuba and Porto Rico gives this book a unique distinction. The fact that he was an eye-witness of the battles which he 
describes so vividly makes his record of the campaign as valuable historically as it is entertaining in a personal and 
pictorial way. 

"Mr. Davis's articles on the war have been characterized by clearness, directness, and high intelligence." New York Timet. 

OUR NAVY IN THE WAR WITH SPAIN 

By JOHN R. SPEARS. With 125 illustrations from photographs, and with charts and diagrams. 12mo, pp. 432, $2.00. 
Mr. Spears's book tells the story in detail and with great spirit of the naval battles, beginning with Manila Bay and 
ending with the destruction of Cervera's fleet, his narrative presenting a complete and vivid record of the splendid deeds 
of the American navy in our war with Spain. The story is one to stir the blood of every patriot. 

COMMERCIAL CUBA 

A Book for Business Men. By WILLIAM J. CLARK. With 8 maps, 7 plans of cities, and 40 full-page illustrations, and a 

Commercial Directory of the Island of Cuba. Large 8vo, $4.00. 

" ' Commercial Cuba,' by William J. Clark, which the Scribners have just published, is a thoroughly good and useful book. We should 
not know where to find within another pair of covers so much and so carefully sifted information bearing on this subject. With the necessary 
warnings against pinning too implicit faith to statistics drawn from Spanish sources, which notoriously make of statistics one of the most 
inexact of sciences, the tables of debt and revenue and trade and production which Mr. Clark has compiled may be studied with real profit. 
Hia painstaking account of the railway and telegraph systems ; of highways and harbors ; of rivers and water supplies, and lighthouses ; of 
sugar and tobacco-growing ; and his detailed description of each province and of every city of any size, together with a ' business directory ' 
for the whole island makes his book one of great value for reference as well as for practical guidance. In the present situation of Cuban affairs 
it should command a wide sale. Its accuracy is certainly of a high order." New York Evening Pott. 

RED ROCK. A Chronicle of Reconstruction 

By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. Illustrated by B. WEST CLINEDINST. 12mo, 81.50. 

" The foremost place among American novels of the season must be given to Mr. Page's ' Red Rock.' " The Outlook. 
" This is an intensely interesting novel, and a historical study of high value. " New York Times. 

REMBRANDT. A Romance of Holland 

By WALTER CRANSTON LARNED. With 8 full-page illustrations. 12mo, $1.50. 

Mr. Larned's novel is of surpassing dramatic interest, the central figures being the great Dutch painter and the famous 
men and women of his day. The ingenuity of the plot, the dramatic sweep of the narrative, and the art with which the 
portraits are painted, lift the book to a high level. 

MISS AMERICA 

Pen and Camera Sketches of the American Girl. By ALEXANDER BLACK. With 75 illustrations from photographs by 

the author. 8vo, 82.50. 

The very diverse activities of the American Girl supply Mr. Black with an entertaining theme, upon which he phil- 
osophizes with shrewdness and humor. Accompanying these comments is a series of photographs of typical American girls 
that form an unusually piquant and varied group of illustrations. 

THE WORKERS THE WEST 

By WALTER A. WYCKOFF. Illustrated by W. R. LEIGH. 12mo, $1.50. 

"No book of the year has done so much to widen human sympathies as 'The Workers.' . . . The two volumes present the best picture 
that has yet been given of the lives of the American working people." The Outlook.

. BISMARCK'S 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY 

BISMARCK, the Man and the Statesman: Being the Reflections 
and Reminiscences of OTTO, PRINCE VON BISMARCK. Written 
and Dictated by Himself after His Retirement from Office. 
Translated from the German under the Supervision of A. J. 
Butler, late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. 

Two Volumes. Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops. 8vo t Cloth, $7.50. 

An International Event of 
Importance F 

The tfrimnken imb <rinnerungtn of Prince Bismarck was written and pre- 
pared by himself. It will be, therefore, the only authoritative biography of the 
Iron Chancellor, who stamped his personality upon the politics of Europe for 
more than half a century during the most important years of Central European 
history. These Reminiscences constitute not alone the autobiography of a great 
statesman, but the most important contribution to historical literature in the last 
quarter of a century. The publication of these Memoirs is an international 
event of importance. 

The book is remarkably full as regards internal affairs, and especially as regards influ- 
ences which prevailed at the Berlin Court, as to the characters both of the Kings of Prussia 
and the other men with whom Bismarck was brought in contact, and it contains a minute 
criticism on the working of the Prussian and the German Constitutions. The first impression 
we take away from the book is that it is an honest book. He is not trying to mislead 
future historians; he is not trying, like Napoleon, to maintain for fresh generations the 
glamor which he had thrown over the eyes of his contemporaries. He does not attempt to 
make himself appear wiser than he was or to have foreseen at the time what afterwards 
occurred. London Daily Chronicle. 

In his reflections and reminiscences Prince Bismarck presents himself in the more 
familiar garb of polite society, with the polished manners of a man of the world, keeping 
his tongue under control, a great and commanding figure self-centred but self-restrained, 
a courtier and a statesman, filling not unworthily with his gigantic personality the world- 
stage on which he moves London Time*.

This book completes the record of Italian Art, bridging 
over the rap between the historic period, so-called, and the 
present time. It is particularly full on the subject of contem- 
porary artists. Through his personal acquaintance with the 
leading Italian painters and sculptors and with Italian author-

NOW READY 

BIRD GODS. By Charles De Kay 

Decorated by GEORGE WHARTON EDWARDS. 
12mo, cloth, $2.00 

A choice and very artistic volume by Hon. Charles De Kay, late Consul-General at Berlin, 
in which the results of much research in out-of-the-way and dead languages are presented in a 
lucid style and a popular way. Everyone interested in birds from the side of humanity or 
natural history, all to whom the beginnings of religion offer fascinating problems, will enjoy 
this book, which is decorated by Mr. George Wharton Edwards, whose clever hand and fancy 
have struck just the right notes of savagery and quaintness for such a theme. Cover, title page, 
beginnings and ends of chapters, tables of contents, etc., have their own charming original 
design, while the pages of text are frequently marked by some little sketch in which the figure 
of some real or mythic bird appears.

Holiday Books Highly Recommended 

FRENCH AND ENGLISH. A Story of the Struggle in America. By E. EVERETT-GREEN, 
author of " A Clerk of Oxford," The Young Pioneers," Tom Tufton's Travels," and Other Historical Tales. 
With 6 Illustrations and a Map showing the scene of the war between the French and English. 8vo, 

cloth extra $1.50 

The Dial says: "Is a well-constructed and vivid story of the terrible struggle which ended on the heights of 

Quebec. It is unusual, in that it gives both sides of the picture; and the figure of Montcalm, as shown here, is 

not less dignified and noble than that of Wolfe." 

THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE. Its Trials and Triumphs. By HAROLD AVERT, author of "Frank's 

First Term." With illustrations. 8vo, cloth extra $1.25 

The Congregationalist says: "It is a natural, stirring, wholesome, and amusing story about boys and their 

pranks and studies, and it will be well-thumbed." 

The Churchman says: "Full of action and such incident as causes a boy's heart to respond to the touch of 

honor and brave deeds." 

CHUMS AT LAST. A Tale of School Life. By A. FORSYTH GRANT. Illustrated. 8vo, cloth 

extra $1.00 

The Congregationalist says: "It is a lively picture of boy life, differing somewhat from corresponding life in 

this country, but sure to be relished by American boys. It will promote sound manliness." 
The Churchman says: "A book to be recommended without qualification." 

KING ALFRED'S VIKING. A Story of the First English Fleet. By CHARLES W. WHISTLER. 

8vo, cloth extra $1.00 

The Dial says: " It is founded upon the life of Alfred written by his chaplain Asser, but it consists chiefly of 

an account of the adventures of the Norsemen who were given charge of the King's fleet. It is a good story, and 

(what is more unusual) it is well written." 

The Standard says: "Opens up new territory to boyish eyes, taking one clear back to the viking days of 

A. D. 800 and thereabouts. The story is told in excellent manner, and the historical atmosphere seems to be 

accurate. . . . Every boy loves the vikings, but the latter too seldom appear in fiction." 

THE GREEN TOBY JUG AND THE PRINCESS WHO LIVED 

OPPOSITE. By Mrs. EDWIN HOHLER. Illustrated. 8vo, cloth extra $1.00 

The Churchman says: " A sweet, simple tale which will hold a place beside Mrs. E wing's charming books."

Helps, and a New Concordance to the Authorized and Revised Versions, combined with a Subject-Index and 
Pronouncing Dictionary of Scripture Proper Names. 

The Sunday School Times, September 17, 1898, says: "The Nelson Teachers' Bible is of high grade. The 
Illustrated Bible Treasury is a collection of helps, more full than most others and showing great care in prepar- 
ation. For example, any one who will compare its treatment of the geography, the topography, the astronomy, 
zoology, mineralogy, botany, or the antiquities of the Bible with similar matter to be found anywhere else, will 
find the comparison greatly to the credit of this Bible. There are about three hundred and fifty illustrations. 
The Concordance, Subject-Index, and Pronouncing Dictionary of Proper Names, are combined under one alpha- 
bet. . . . Another especial excellence is that its Concordance covers the Revised Version as well as the Old 
Version."

Christian Standard. 

THE GENTLE ART OF PLEASING. 

By ELIZABETH GLOVER. 16mo, cloth decorated, gilt 

top, $1.00. 

The author's thought is that few of us know when we displease, but 
all can learn how to please. She has noted that many, although keenly 
conscious of social exclusion, seldom have any inkling of its reasons. 
Hence this little book, which is lovingly inscribed to all who would 
unveil and adorn that individual beauty of soul sure to have been im- 
pressed by the hand of the Maker. 

JEFFERSON WILDRIDER. 

A New England Story. By ELIZABETH GLOVER. 12mo, 

cloth decorated, gilt top, $1.25. 

A story treating New England life and character broadly, and with

the reciprocal influence of one character upon another. The author, 
with marked force and occasional touches of humor and genuine pathos, 
tells a story of intrinsic interest.

The story of a courtship which involved the play of intense, fanatic, 
religious feeling, and the deep forces which master the human heart 
in its experience of the tender passion. The life of the period called 
the " Great Awakening " has never been previously touched in fiction. 
This book is a gateway into a fresh realm of New England life, full of 
startling changes and tragic situations.

all her writings. 

" ' The Tangled Skein ' is marked by all of those qualities of genius 
which readers are accustomed to associate with Mrs. Walworth, and in 
addition reveals her in a new role as the writer of the best detective 
story of the year. The narrative is clever, dramatic, and rich in sur- 
prises." RICHARD HKNRY STODDAED, in New York Mail and Express.

THE 
BUTTERFLY BOOK. 

OUTTERFLIES are far more 
JL3 easily collected and studied than 
birds ; there are as many different 
species in America as there are of 
birds, and the colors of the butterflies 
are more variegated and beautiful. 

We have just published the first 
successful attempt to make unscien- 
tific nature - lovers acquainted with 
these fascinating creatures. " The 
Butterfly Book " has, besides hun- 
dreds of black-and-white illustrations, 
48 colored plates which exactly repro- 
duce the hues of over a thousand 
North American butterflies. This 
color photography is really more re- 
markable than any color printing 
that has been done hitherto. The pic- 
tures have been photographed direct 
from the specimens in the author's 
unrivaled collection, which contains 
almost all the " types " from which 
the species were originally named. 

Dr. W. J. Holland, the author, 
Director of the Carnegie Museum in 
Pittsburg, has an international repu- 
tation among entomologists, and his 
book is at once scientific and popular. 
Its " digressions " furnish a mass of 
entertaining facts and fancies about 
butterflies gathered from the litera- 
ture of all ages. 

A hundred and fifty of the species 
shown in these plates have never been 
figured before, even in the two stand- 
ard works on the subject costing 
respectively $75. and f 135. " The 
Butterfly Book " costs $3. net. 

A copy will be sent "on approval " 
if desired.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



A Weekly Library for Five Cents a Week 

"PUBLIC OPINION," writes an enthusiastic admirer, "is a weekly library 
brought to my own door for five cents a week." " The present," says another, " is 
the busiest of all ages, and compression, condensation, and sifting, the most blessed 
of all services, and these services are rendered by PUBLIC OPINION as by no 
other instrumentality." 

WHAT ITS READERS THINK OF IT 



It is a busy man's weekly. 
It is the substance of 3000 periodicals. 
It is a reading-room brought into my study. 
It is the world's progress in a nutshell. 
It is THE INDISPENSABLE WEEKLY ; others are luxuries. 
It is a weekly photograph of public sentiment. 
It gives every side of every important question. 
It is a time-saver, a talent-saver, a money-saver. 
It is the best weekly outlook for professional people. 
It is a weekly record of all that's worth remembering. 
It reflects with fairness every phase of public opinion. 
It is the best weekly exponent of the world's life and 
thought. 



Its readers are auditors of the world's debates. 

I am spending an evening every week over the paper 
with a profit which I get nowhere else. 

If I took no other paper, PUBLIC OPINION would 
still keep me abreast of the times. 

If I took one hundred periodicals I should still want 
PUBLIC OPINION. 

When it reaches my table every one of the other 
twenty papers to which I subscribe must give way to it. 

It is the only single publication issued in the world 
which keeps its readers fully abreast of the times, week 
by week. 

My wife, too, finds it exactly suited to her odds and 
ends of time, and so she keeps up with the day. 



NEW DEPARTURE 

PUBLIC OPINION continues to be, as its friends have styled it, THE INDISPENS- 
ABLE WEEKLY, but it will issue each month during 1899 a special magazine number. 
This issue will not lose sight of those features which have made PUBLIC OPINION 
indispensable to its readers. It is designed to add a wider range of literary thought 
and a more sweeping survey of intellectual progress.

WILLIAM SLACK. 

A review, to be found further on in these 
pages, of the latest novel by William Black, 
expresses the hope that his pen may continue to 
furnish forth many more novels for the enter- 
tainment and delight of his readers. We leave 
the review to stand as it was written, but the hope 
has proved futile, for the novelist died at his 
home near London a few days ago. His position 
among the writers of our time has been a dis- 
tinguished one for fully thirty years, and a brief 
survey of his life and literary activity becomes 
appropriate upon the present occasion. 

Born in Glasgow, in 1841, William Black 
had attained the age of fifty-seven years at the 



448 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



time of his death. His education was somewhat 
irregular, and he never went through the public 
school and university courses which prepare 
most Englishmen who attain intellectual dis- 
tinction for their work. Instead, he was taught 
in private institutions, and, his early leanings 
being in the direction of art, he spent two years 
in the Government Art School of his native city. 
* ' As an artist," he says, " I was a complete fail- 
ure, and so qualified myself for a time in after 
life as art critic." But it must be remarked, 
as a corrective to his own humorous self-depreci- 
ation, that his insight into the artistic tempera- 
ment is one of the characteristic features of his 
literary work, and that, if success in landscape 
painting upon the canvas was beyond his reach, 
few writers have ever been so successful in the 
verbal painting of landscape. The impression 
of natural beauty, as conveyed by hundreds of 
descriptive pages scattered through his novels, 
is deep and lasting ; one of the chief causes of 
our indebtedness to him is his joy in the change- 
ful moods of nature, in which he has made every 
one of his readers share. 

When Black made the discovery that he could 
write better than he could paint, he found in 
journalism the doorway to literature, as so many 
others have done, and became connected with 
the London " Morning Star." This was in 1865, 
when Mr. Justin McCarthy was the editor of 
that journal. He served the " Star " as special 
correspondent at the time of the war between 
Prussia and Austria. Soon thereafter he be- 
came a member of the " Daily News " editorial 
staff, occupying that post for several years, and 
writing leaders upon politics and questions of 
the day. Meanwhile, he was fledging his wings 
as a novelist ; and in 1867 " Love or Marriage" 
was published in the conventional three-volume 
form. This was soon followed by " In Silk 
Attire," and this by " Kilmeny," a beautiful 
and pathetic story, written during the period 
of seclusion that followed the double bereave- 
ment caused by the death of his wife and his 
child. In 1871 " A Daughter of Heth " ap- 
peared, and its author leaped into popularity 
with the wider public that had known nothing 
of his preceding books. This sudden accession 
of fame found abundant warrant in the work to 
which it was due, for " A Daughter of Heth " 
was not only vastly superior to anything that had 
come before it, but was to remain the supreme 
artistic achievement of the writer. When we now 
look back to it, we look along the vista of more 
than a score of novels that have followed it, and 
we find no one of them as completely satisfy- 



ing, symmetrical, and artistic in the finest sense. 

The story of Black's life during the seven- 
ties, eighties, and nineties, is the story of his 
books and nothing more. Even his trip to the 
United States, in the early seventies, calls for 
no comment beyond the statement that it in- 
spired " Green Pastures and Picadilly," and 
possibly the further observation that from this 
time on the novelist's heroines became some- 
what alarmingly addicted to humor of the 
American rather than the English type. For 
the rest, his seasons, like those of his heroes, 
alternated between the drawing - rooms and 
clubs of London and the coasts and moors of the 
Highlands that he loved so well. The one seri- 
ous book that he wrote was the life of Goldsmith 
contributed to the " English Men of Letters " 
series in 1879. The novels, as we have said, 
number upwards of a score, for hardly a year 
has passed since he began to write them that 
has not added one or two to the list. 

Among all these fictions, some are so lament- 
ably weak that they had far better have re- 
mained unwritten. Probably " That Beautiful 
Wretch " represents the lowest plane upon 
which it was possible for Black's talent to work. 
Many others must be considered pot-boilers 
and nothing more. Still others are the merest 
replicas, as to motive, situations, and accessories, 
of his early successes, and nothing more need 
be said of them. But there remains a residuum 
of work, including perhaps half a dozen titles, 
which cannot be ignored in any survey of Vic- 
torian literature, and upon which the author's 
fame will ultimately rest. Of " A Daughter 
of Heth " we have already spoken, and " A 
Princess of Thule " must be placed on nearly 
the same level in a comparative estimate of 
Black's novels. In " Judith Shakespeare " he 
acquitted himself of a peculiarly delicate task 
with rare tact and restraint. Its glimpses of 
the homely life of that spacious age in which 
the poet lived, and of the poet himself in his 
character as a prosperous citizen of Stratford, 
are altogether charming, and display unfail- 
ing taste. When " Sunrise " appeared, many 
among the novelist's following rubbed their 
eyes at this strange new departure, for here 
Black deserted his wonted haunts and familiar 
characters to write a romance on the European 
revolutionary movement, a romance filled with 
plottings and dark secrets, a romance inspired 
by the " Songs before Sunrise " that, a few 
years previously, had revealed in Mr. Swin- 
burne so great a lyrical gift as had not been 
known since Shelley. But " Sunrise " was only

a " sport " among the author's writings, and he 
at once reverted to his earlier manner and his 
well-worn themes. Among the remaining nov- 
els, there are none that stand out from the others 
quite as distinctly as the four that we have 
named. The tragic gloom that enwraps the 
ending of " Macleod of Dare " makes the 
reader remember it rather better than its fel- 
lows, and the more gracious aspects of the nov- 
elist's talent are perhaps better displayed than 
elsewhere in such books as " White Wings " 
and " White Heather." But we will make no 
more invidious comparisons. We have read 
with some gratitude even the feeblest of these 
novels, and with much gratitude the best of 
them. They have provided sweet and whole- 
some entertainment for many an idle hour, and 
we reflect with genuine sorrow that the source 
of this entertainment is now dried up forever. 
It is related that Carlyle once said to Black, 
in the course of a conversation : " Ay, ay, ye 
ken our Scotland weel, but tell me, mon, when 
are ye gaun to do some wark ? " Souls of the 
strenuous sort, who expect novelists to deal 
with the serious problems of society, and who 
insist upon the ethical motive, if not upon the 
didactical method, will not find their account 
in the novels of William Black, unless they 
think of him solely as the author of " Sunrise." 
Such souls have their Mr. Meredith and their 
Mr. Hardy and their Mrs. Humphry Ward, 
and we do not deny them the right to their 
point of view. But when they go out of the 
way to institute invidious comparisons between 
the novelists they happen to like and such ac- 
complished craftsmen of a different sort as Mr. 
Black and Mr. Blackmore, we feel bound to 
protest. The novelist who has just died did 
not have the genius of Mr. George Meredith, 
for example, but he cultivated a saner method, 
and the talent that expresses itself by the meth- 
ods of sanity is not unworthy of being ranked, 
in the total estimate, upon a level with the 
genius that expresses itself by, let us say, 
that we may avoid the harsher term so obvi- 
ously suggested, the methods of perversity. 
Those intellectuels, in the name of whatever 
uncouth or morbid form of art they may make 
their plea, are not to be allowed the final word 
when it comes to an appraisal of so grace- 
ful and abundantly-endowed a writer as was 
the one from whom the world he has enriched 
must now take a sorrowful leave. William 
Black will always be reckoned as one of the five 
or six best English novelists of his time that 
is, of the last quarter of the nineteenth century. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



DR. ROLFE'S NOTES ON TENNYSON. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the Publishers' Note prefacing the new Cambridge 
Tennyson are these words: 

" Tennyson, as is well known, subjected his poems to fre- 
quent revision, and the editor has therefore, in addition to giv- 
ing the authoritative text with scrupulous care, collated the 
volumes of 1830 and 1833. the edition of 1842, and all others 
to which he has had access in this country and in the library 
of the British Museum, and has recorded the various read- 
ings in his notes. He has also, both in his notes and in the 
several introductions and brief prefaces, made a thorough 
bibliographical study of the poetry, so that the reader is now 
able to trace with great exactness the history of Tennyson's 
work." 

This collation of Tennyson's volumes, especially the 
early ones of 1830, 1833, and 1842, has long been 
needed, and if it has here been done well the students 
of the poet will be much indebted both to the editor 
and to the publishers. A study of the first two pages 
of " Notes and Illustrations," pp. 794-795 of the Cam- 
bridge Tennyson, will suffice to test the accuracy of the 
collating. We follow the order of the editor. 
To the Queen. 

" The following is the stanza referring to the Crystal Palace 
Exhibition of 1851, which originally followed the 6th : 
"She brought a vast design to pass 
When Europe and the scattered ends 
Of onr fierce world did meet as friends 
And brethren in her halls of glass." 
Instead of this, the stanza originally read: 

"She brought a vast design to pass, 
When Europe and the scattered ends 
Of our fierce world were mixt as friends 
And brethren in her halls of glass." 

The editor mentions no other variations; but he should 
have done so, for our present 4th stanza was inserted in 
the next edition (the 8th), and four other slight changes 
were made after its first appearance. 
Leonine Elegiacs. 

The editor notes no changes. But later editions 
changed " Deeply the turtle coos " and " Thou cometh 
morning and even " to the present readings. 
Supposed Confessions. 

After quoting 17 lines omitted from later editions, 
Dr. Rolfe adds: 

" The only other change is ' rosy fingers ' for ' waxen fingers ' 
in line 42." 
But in the 1830 edition we have the line, 

" Shall men live thus, in joy and hope " 
Isabel. 

" The only change in 1842 was ' blanched ' for ' blenched,' 
which was probably a misprint." 

Not so; for another line, changed in 1842, originally 
stood 

" The laws of wifehood charactered in gold " 
Mariana. 
Of the line 

" He held the peach to the garden wall " 
Dr. Rolfe says: 

" The line was changed in the printed poem at least as early 
as 1875." 

It was changed in the edition of 1860. 
He says of the line 

" For leagues no other tree did dark" 



450 



THE DIAL, 



[Deo. 16, 



that it was " changed as early aa 1856." True, but 
it was aUo changed as early as 1845. 

" In line 63, the original 'sang i' the pane ' was retained in 
all the editions I hare seen down to 1875." 
This is not correct, as none of the editions between 
1850 and 1875 have " sang i' the pane." 



" Printed in 1830 without the division into stanzas, which 
was made in 1842. The only other change is ' amorously ' 
for ' three times three ' in the hut stanza." 
Bat the change was in the errata of the original volume. 
Recollections of the Arabian Nights. 

Here two lines escaped the eye of the collator: 

"From wreathed silvers looked to shame " 
and 

" Flowing below her rosehued zone "; 
Ode to Memory. 

Instead of three changes made in subsequent editions, 
Dr. Rolfe should have mentioned five. The two he 
fails to give are 

" When the first matin song hath waked lond " 
and 

" The few whom passion hath not blinded," 
The Poet. 

"The only change in the poem since 1830 is in the 12th 
stanza." 

On the contrary, the second line of the 9th stanza in the 
volume of 1830 reads 

" Like a great garden showed "; 
and the second of the 14th, 

"Of wrath her right arm hurled." 
The PoeCt mind. 

Here the editor failed to observe that the third line 
from the end in the edition of 1830 reads 

" Yon would never hear it your eyes are so dull." 
The Sea Fairies. 

As the poem was completely recast in 1853, the editor 
has given the original text in full. One line is not given 
correctly, 

"When the sharp clear twang of the golden chords." 
The Dying Swan. 

" Reprinted in 1842 with two slight verbal changes." 
Again not accurate, for one of these, " Which loudly did 
lament," remained unchanged until the edition of 1850. 
Adeline. 

''The only changes in 1842 were in the 5th stanza." 

This is not the case ; for the first one, " the side of 
the morn," was not made until 1853, and the second, 
" locks a-drooping," not until 1863. 

These poems are treated of on the first two of the 
eighty pages of " Notes and Illustrations." On these 
pages, as we have seen, the collator has made as many 
as twenty mistakes, and besides these there are a num- 
ber of misleading statements. These first pages, more- 
over, are not exceptional but typical.

FOREIGN BOOKS IN JAPAN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

As some interesting information with reference to the 
demand for foreign works in Japan has recently been 
made public in the " Japan Times " by Messrs. Maruya 
and Company, the only Japanese importers of foreign 
books, I submit here several items therefrom. 

Works relating to architecture and building, chem- 



istry, electricity and magnetism, engineering and me- 
chanics, manufactures and industrial arts, metallurgy 
and mining, together with dictionaries and encyclo- 
pedias, enjoy the largest demand. In chemistry, Rem- 
sen is one of the popular authors ; in metallurgy, Phillips's 
work heads the list ; in electricity and magnetism, 
Thomson's works find the largest number of purcha- 
sers ; and there is an active demand for Taggart's 
41 Cotton Spinning." The favorite dictionary is Nut- 
tail's Standard Dictionary," of which the firm above 
named has already sold between two and three hundred 
thousand copies ! Next comes " Webster's Condensed 
Dictionary," and even " Webster's Unabridged " sells 
at the rate of from fifty to sixty copies per month. The 
" Students' Standard Dictionary " also sells well. 

Works on scientific subjects, especially new publica- 
tions, are in great demand, and show the eagerness 
of Japanese students to become acquainted with the 
results of the latest investigations. In astronomy, New- 
comb and Holden's popular treatise comes first. In 
pedagogics, Herbart is the most popular author at pres- 
ent In history, Fisher's " Universal History " heads 
the list; in general, works on modern history are in 
greater demand than those of earlier periods. The 
greater demand for language books, among which the 
Otto series stands first, may be due to the near approach 
of the date of mixed residence. Mathematical books 
are only in fair request. 

In medicine, German books have practically driven 
from the field works in other languages. In politics and 
diplomacy, however, French works are preferred ; Walk- 
er's " Political Economy," Jevons's " Money," and Has- 
tiat's " Science of Finance " have a large sale. In law, 
German works are beginning to predominate. Taine's 
" English Literature " heads the list in works of that 
class, and is used as a text-book or work of reference 
in several higher institutions of learning. Of books 
on Japan, Griffis's " Mikado's Empire " maintains its 
ground as the favorite. Works on antiquities and 
ethnology, elocution and oratory, theology and religion, 
are said to be practically devoid of demand; but philo- 
sophical works find good sale, with Herbert Spencer in 
the van. 

Fifty years ago a foreign book had to be smuggled 
into Japan and studied secretly; and many an earnest 
scholar paid with his life the penalty for desiring a broad 
education through books. Fifty years ago, Dutch books 
were about the only ones, except Chinese, that got into 
the Empire even by smuggling. Now information is 
eagerly sought from all quarters of the globe; and books 
in many languages are readable by Japanese.

WHO SAID "WE ARE ALL SOCIALISTS NOW"? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

I notice that a reviewer in a recent issue of THE DIAL 
ascribes to Lord Salisbury the dictum, " We are all 
Socialists now " [vide p. 299.] 

I had supposed Sir William Haroourt said these words 
originally. In "Fabian Essays" [Charles E. Brown 
& Co., Boston, 1894] p. 190, I find this sentence from 
Mr. Hubert Bland: 

II Why, for instance, does that extremely well oiled 
and accurately poised political weathercock, Sir William 
Harcourt, pointing to the dawn, crow out that ' We are 
all Socialists now ' " ? HENRY W. THCRBTON.

FRANCIS PABKMAN AND -His WORK.* 

The publishers of the works of Francis 
Parkman deserve thanks for presenting a de- 
lightful new edition, printed from entirely new 
plates, on excellent paper, and illustrated with 
twenty-four photogravure plates made by Goupil 
from historical portraits and from works of 
well-known artists of the present time. It is 
one that in all respects satisfies the lover of 
good books well set forth. Whatever future 
editions may do in the way of furnishing illus- 
trations and notes, this edition must be the de- 
finitive text of the historian, who was his own 
best artist. 

Francis Parkman was the greatest painter 
of historical pictures that this country per- 
haps it is not too much to say, that any country 
has produced. With correct scholarship, 
fidelity, graphic power, and literary beauty, he 
portrayed the scenes in the struggle between 
the French, the English, and the Indian, for 
the mastery of the American forest. Despite the 
fact that he chose the vehicle of prose, his work 
has also much in common with the great epic 
poems, for he dealt adequately with a period 
peculiarly suited to epic treatment in the sim- 
plicity of the contending civilizations, in the 
figures of the actors, in the grandeur of the pri- 
meval wilderness where the events progressed, 
and in the dignity of the great issues at stake. 

In his sophomore days, Parkman planned 
to write the story of the Old French War. 
"Here, as it seemed to me," he tells a friend, 
" the forest drama was more stirring and the 
forest stage more thronged with appropriate 
actors than in any other passage of our history. 
It was not till some years later," he adds, " that 
I enlarged the plan to include the whole course 
of the American conflict between France and 
England, or, in other words, the history of the 
American forest ; for this was the light in 
which I regarded it. My theme fascinated me, 
and I was haunted with wilderness images day 
and night." To this ideal he gave his whole 
sensitive nature with a vehemence that broke 
his physical powers. Labor became to him a 
passion and rest intolerable. He not only read 
books zealously, but he made long and trying 
expeditions into the forest; and when his eyes 
began to fail him, while a youth of twenty-

three, he turned to study Indian life in the 
region where it could still be seen in something 
like its original form. Parkman's visit to the 
Oregon Trail, thus undertaken in 1846, gave 
him an intimate understanding of the life of 
the frontier, and of the primitive Indian vil- 
lage in the days just prior to its passing away ; 
but the strain of following the savages in their 
hunting parties, and the hardships of wigwam 
life, left his eyes and his nervous system nearly 
ruined. The force of this blow can only be 
realized by one who knows (as Parkman clearly 
knew) the vast masses of manuscripts to be 
gathered from the scattered libraries of Europe 
and America, the minute comparison of their 
details, and the critical gathering of innumer- 
able facts into orderly and accurate form, that 
must precede the work of the historian of this 
period. When he began his task, Parkman 
estimated that twenty years would be required 
to complete it. But his brain was so over- 
sensitive during a considerable portion of his 
life, that creative effort inflicted intense tor- 
ture, and could be continued but a few minutes 
at a time ; moreover, he was forced to use the 
eyes of others for research. It is not strange, 
therefore, that the twenty years grew to more 
than forty-five, that the work, begun in his eager 
college days, stretched out until he closed his 
career, an old man of seventy. While he had 
filled all the gaps in his work at his death, it 
still lacked final revision to make the series an 
absolutely consistent and unified whole. 

A splendid panorama is unrolled by the 
very names of Parkman's books. The order 
of their production was not in the natural se- 
quence of the episodes. Fearful lest his pre- 
carious strength should desert him completely 
before he had achieved the task to which he 
had set himself, he postponed some volumes to 
finish others for which his material was more 
thoroughly collected, or which he regarded as 
of paramount importance. While fresh from 
his Indian studies on the great plains, he dic- 
tated to the companion of his journey " The 
Oregon Trail," which appeared in the " Knick- 
erbocker Magazine " in 1847, just prior to the 
great rush across the plains to the gold of Cal- 
ifornia. " The wild cavalcade that defiled with 
me down the gorges of the Black Hills, with 
its paint and war-plumes, fluttering trophies 
and savage embroidery, bows, arrows, lances, 
and shields, will never be seen again," so he 
writes in 1872 ; and twenty years later he 
could say : " The wild Indian is turned into 
an ugly caricature of his conqueror. . . . The

slow cavalcade of horsemen armed to the teeth 
has disappeared before parlor cars and the 
effeminate comforts of modern travel." Thus, 
Parkman, who was to write of the passing of 
the frontier in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, trained himself by a hard, but per- 
haps not too dearly bought, experience on the 
last frontier of the United States, in the middle 
of the nineteenth century a frontier which 
disappeared while the historian's work was in 
progress. It was natural that he should next 
turn to "Pontiac's Conspiracy," which he 
chose, although the last in the natural order of 
his historical series, because, as he tells us, it 
afforded " better opportunities than any other 
portion of American history for portraying 
forest life and the Indian character "; he aimed 
" to portray the American forest and the Amer- 
ican Indian at thf period when both received 
their final doom." As an introduction to this 
drama of the frontier he gave an unsurpassed 
study of Indian character, as well as an out- 
line of the history of New France to the begin- 
ning of Pontiac's war. The two volumes of 
this book are perhaps the most widely read of 
1'aikman's works ; and in their dramatic power, 
their contributions to Indian psychology, as 
well as in the extensiveness of view furnished 
by the introduction, they deserve their place. 
Yet it must be admitted that Parkman's style 
lacked maturity here, and that these volumes 
made less demands upon his scholarship and 
judgment than did some of the later ones. 

" The Pioneers of New France," with its stir- 
ring tale of Coligny, Menendez, Ribault, and 
Champlain, followed in 1865 ; and two years 
later came " The Jesuits in North America." 
The friendship of the Abbe Casgrain with 
Parkman illustrates the historian's success in 
dealing with the difficult subject of Catholic 
ideals and work. Casgrain believed Parkman 
to reject equally the Protestant ideas and 
Catholic dogmas, and declared : " He is purely 
rationalistic ; he admits no other principle than 
the vague theory which is called modern civil- 
ization." " One recognizes," he says, " a soul 
rightly inclined and born for truth, but lost 
without compass on a boundless ocean." With- 
out admitting the correctness of Parkman's 
generalizations, and while sometimes resenting 
the indulgent amusement with which he relates 
the miraculous in early Canada, the fair-minded 
members of the Church have accorded to Park- 
man the recognition of his service in bringing 
before the Protestant reader a sympathetic and 
graphic picture of the Jesuit missionary. Re- 



cent monographic work of special students has 
added materially to our knowledge of the work 
of these missionaries, and new documents have 
come to light ; but aside from the critical read- 
ing of the great mass of the " Relations " them- 
selves, the reader can hardly get a more graphic, 
appreciative, and at the same time discrimi- 
nating, view of the noble devotion of these 
heroes of their faith. 

In 1869, Parkman published his "Dis- 
covery of the Great West," which he revised 
and issued under the title of La Salle and 
the Discovery of the Great West " in 1878. 
This revision was necessary, owing to the re- 
fusal of Margry to admit him at first to certain 
manuscripts pertaining to La Salle. This 
leader's high-souled expeditions had completed 
the claims of France to the Mississippi Valley ; 
interest was next to turn to the conflicts be- 
tween England and France for the possession 
of these domains, and Parkman introduced at 
this point (1874) his " Old Regime in Canada," 
a description of the social and political organ- 
ization along the St. Lawrence, to which, in 
his revision of 1893, he prefixed a section on 
the rival claimants of Acadia, La Tour and 
D'Aunay. About one-half the book is given 
to the exposition of the Canadian organization. 
No one will deny the thoroughness of Park- 
man's study of his materials, nor the brilliancy 
of his characterizations. But he was not so 
skilful in exposition of the development of 
institutions as he was in the delineation of 
men and events. All his historical tastes and 
methods were formed before institutional study 
became fixed in the United States. These 
facts, together with the attempt to describe a 
society in a single view by material drawn 
from a whole century, render this book, charm- 
ing as it is, perhaps the least satisfactory to 
the critical historian. In " Frontenac and New 
France under Louis XIV" (1877), we plunge 
into the storm and stress of the intercolonial 
wars, and the figure of the great governor is 
one of the abiding memories of Parkman's 
readers. These wars that follow had their re- 
lation to the New England fisheries, to the 
frontier hamlets of New England and of the 
middle region, and to the fur-trading posts of 
the interior. In all of these aspects, Park- 
man's touch is firm, true, and artistic. We see 
the activity of the coast, the ideals and prim- 
itive life of the backwoods Puritan, the traits 
of the bushrangers and borderers of Pennsyl- 
vania and Virginia, and the life of the lawless 
fur-trader.

Instead of carrying the series continuously 
on, the author now postponed the treatment 
of the half-century prior to the Seven Years 
War, in order to make sure of completing the 
design of his youth. " Montcalm and Wolfe " 
(1884) represents his full maturity, and is 
worthy of the great crisis in the history of the 
world with which it deals. It shows the author 
at his best in laborious collection and criti- 
cism of manuscript sources, in breadth of view, 
in precision of statement, and in sureness of 
touch. Every page tells of careful study, of 
the locality as well as of the written material. 
It is the crown of his work. 

In "A Half Century of Conflict" (1892), 
Parkman filled the gap in his work between 
1700 and 1748. Possibly because of the lack 
of unity of the period, the work lacks some of 
the throbbing vitality of his earlier books, but 
it is still a most interesting survey of the period, 
taking us to the Big Horn Mountains in the 
Northwest, and to Santa Fe in the Southwest ; 
while the English are gaining the Ohio Valley. 
Perhaps it is at this point that Parkman missed 
an opportunity. This half-century intervened 
between the picturesque era of exploration and 
the sunset glories of New France. The dra- 
matic centre in the story he is telling turns 
from the Frenchmen to the frontiersmen of the 
English colony, pushing along the river valleys 
and into the up-country of the South. To have 
adequately portrayed the origin of this army 
of invasion of the pioneer settlers, would have 
furnished the touch that the book lacks. But 
it was with Parkman as with Milton : it is not 
the Puritan of his New England home who lies 
closest to the artistic soul of Parkman. He 
praises the Puritan's ideals, but it is the French 
gentilhomme, with all of his forest diablerie, 
who is the real hero of his epic. 

Summing up the limitations of Parkman, it 
must be admitted that he was fortunate in his 
theme. It is not certain that he would have 
been preeminent in other fields of historical 
research. It was the picturesque story of the 
American forest that filled his imagination, as 
he tells us ; and this romantic period permitted, 
nay, demanded, those very qualities of Park- 
man's mind and style that might have led him 
astray in other fields. Indeed, it is doubtful 
if that very style that is so prominent an ele- 
ment in his success is unreservedly commend- 
able. What was in its nature dull, Parkman 
willingly avoided ; over what was repulsive he 
cast the mellow light of his style, until the bare 
atrocities of savage life, though frankly told, 



do not stand out in their own naked enormity. 
It needs the Hogarthian pages of the journals 
of Radisson, or of the younger Henry, to make 
them appreciated. 

There are points of detail in which Park- 
man needs correction, but they are not many ; 
nor is this the place for discussion of such min- 
ute questions. In his revised editions he did not 
fully study and incorporate the new material 
that came to light in the interval. But what is 
surprising is that he could have entered a field 
where tradition so held sway, supported by the 
filial respect of antagonistic peoples, a field 
where the contending societies were so based on 
antipodal ideas of church and state, and, in 
the midst of the innumerable problems and pit- 
falls of historical details, have preserved his rep- 
utation for justness and for accuracy. Perhaps 
it is still more remarkable that one whose in- 
vestigations had to include the collection and 
criticism of his material from the beginning, 
should have so transformed this raw product 
into a great work of art. For it cannot be too 
strongly stated that whatever criticisms are to 
be made on Parkman's work must come chiefly 
from considerations of what the function of 
history really is, and of what are the true ideals 
of society. As a literary treatment of his 
theme, Parkman's work is definitive. Natur- 
alists will study the American forest more 
scientifically; the physiographical conditions 
that determined the frontier development of 
the French, the English, and the Indians will 
be more adequately investigated ; but no one is 
likely to bring back to the eyes of men that 
vast, continuous forest with such reality and 
loving sympathy of touch in its minute details, 
as well as in its immensity. Others will study 
the linguistics, the mythology, the ethnology 
of the American Indian with a more scientific 
training ; but in the pages of no later writer 
will actual Indian society live as it lives in 
those of Parkman. The Canadian parishes 
will still yield to the student of society ma- 
terial for new work ; but the noblesse and the 
clergy, the voyageur and the habitant, are less 
alive in the pages even of recent famous his- 
torical novelists than they are in the works of 
this historical master. Parkman was at once 
a scholar and an artist. His wide research, 
his critical astuteness, his fairness of temper, 
his insight into the meaning of historical move- 
ments, made him a great historian. But his 
work will live because he was even greater as 
an artist than as a historian.

A FAMOUS NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT 
or THE CIVIL, WAR.* 

To those who remember the " Boston Jour- 
nal " in its best days, when " Carleton's " let- 
ters formed one of its leading features, to the 
many who have known Charles Carleton Coffin 
as a familiar figure in the city which was so 
long his home, and as a frequent visitor to 
other cities throughout the country, and to his 
thousands of readers everywhere, a life of the 
distinguished war correspondent, traveller, and 
author, by the Rev. Dr. Griffis, his former 
pastor, will be welcome. 

Of New Hampshire birth and Puritan an- 
cestry, all the conditions of Mr. Coffin's early 
life were favorable to the development of those 
sterling qualities on which alone he relied in 
"winning his way." As an editorial writer in 
Boston, in 1856, when he was thirty-three years 
of age, he became identified with the newly- 
formed Republican party, giving his enthusi- 
astic support to Fremont, and, four years later, 
to Lincoln, whose nomination at Chicago he has 
described as an eye-witness, in some autobio- 
graphical notes which were never published. 
A Lincoln anecdote which will be new to most 
readers is given by him : 

' I accompanied the committee to Springfield to notify 
Lincoln of his nomination. . . . We went down the 
Illinois Central. It was a hot, dusty ride. Reached 
Springfield early in the evening. Had supper at the 
hotel, and then called on Lincoln. His two youngest 
boys were on the fence in front of the house, chaffing 
some Democratic urchins in the street. A Douglas 
meeting was going on in the State House, addressed, as 
I learned, by A. McClernand afterwards Major- 
General. Lincoln stood in the parlor, dressed in black 
frock coat. Ashman made the formal announcement. 
Lincoln's reply was brief. He was much constrained, 
but as soon as the last word was spoken be turned to 
Kelly and said: 

" < Judge, you are a pretty tall man. How tall are 
you?' 

" ' Six feet two.' 

" I beat you. I 'm six feet three without my high- 
heeled boots on.' 

44 Pennsylvania bows to Illinois, where we have been 
told there were only Little Giants,' said Kelly, gracefully 
alluding to Douglas, who was called the Little Giant. 

44 One by one we were introduced by Mr. Ashman. 
After the handshaking was over, Mr. Lincoln said: 

44 ' Mrs. Lincoln will be pleased to see you, gentlemen, 
in the adjoining room, where you will find some refresh- 
ments.' 

44 We passed into the room. . . . The only sign of re- 
freshments visible was a white earthen pitcher filled 
with ice- water. Probably it was Mr. Lincoln's little 
joke, for the next morning I learned that his Republican

neighbors had offered to furnish wines and liquor, but 
he would not allow them in the house; that his Demo- 
cratic friends also sent round baskets of champagne, 
which he would not accept." 

After a short term of service as night editor 
of the " Boston Journal," at ten dollars a week, 
Mr. Coffin became, on the outbreak of hostili- 
ties between the North and South, war corre- 
spondent of the same paper, where his graphic 
and trustworthy letters from the front, with 
the familiar signature of " Carleton," became 
known and eagerly sought for throughout the 
North. The accounts of his experiences with 
the army and on the battle-field are very inter- 
esting reading. After the battle of Gettysburg, 
Dr. Griffis tells us, 

44 Carleton felt satisfied that Lee was in full retreat, 
though General Meade did not seem to think so. Carle- 
ton's face was now set Bostonwards. Not being able to 
use the army telegraph, he gave bis first thought to 
reaching the railroad. The nearest point was at West- 
minster, twenty-eight miles distant, from which a freight- 
train was to leave at 4 P. M. 

44 Rain was falling heavily, but with Whitelaw Reid 
as companion, Carleton rode the twenty-eight miles in 
two hours and a half. Covered with mud from head to 
foot, and soused to the skin, the two riders reached 
Westminster at 3:55 P. M. As the train did not imme- 
diately start, Carleton arranged for the care of his beast, 
and laying his blanket on the engine's boiler, dried it. He 
then made his bed on the floor of the bumping car, get- 
ting some sleep of an uncertain quality before the train 
rolled into Baltimore. 

" At the hotel on Sunday morning he was seized by 
his friend, E. B. Washburn, Grant's indefatigable sup- 
porter and afterwards Minister to France, who asked 
for news. Carleton told him of victory and the retreat 
of Lee. ' You lie,' was the impulsive answer. Wash- 
burn's nerves had for days been under a strain. Then, 
after telling more, Carleton telegraphed a half-column 
of news to the 4 Journal' in Boston. This message, 
sent thence to Washington, was the first news President 
Lincoln and the Cabinet had of Gettysburg." 

Carleton stayed with the Army of the Potomac, 
sharing its vicissitudes and recording its defeats 
and triumphs, until the close of the war. The 
moral effect of his letters and despatches, in 
dark days even more than in bright, can hardly 
be overestimated. 

Sent abroad by the " Journal " to report the 
Austro-Prussian war, Mr. Coffin arrived in 
Europe only to find the battle of Sadowa a 
thing of the past, and th combatants again at 
peace. Yet he remained as foreign correspond- 
ent of his paper, and was soon commissioned by 
it to continue eastward around the world, send- 
ing home letters as he went. This tour of the 
world he made in company with his wife, and 
its record is presented in book form in " Our 
New Way Around the World." His bio- 
grapher's statement that Mr. Coffin was the

first, so far as is known, to circle the globe, 
starting eastward from America and using 
steam as the motor of transportation on land 
and water all the way, is not quite correct, 
inasmuch as the Central Pacific railway was 
not completed when Mr. and Mrs. Coffin, in the 
fall of 1868, left California for the East. Seven 
days and nights of staging interrupted the con- 
tinuity of the railroad journey. 

Mr. Coffin served several terms in the Massa- 
chusetts legislature, both as representative and 
as senator, and left his mark on the statute- 
book. The law placing the Boston police un- 
der state control, and that abolishing grade 
crossings throughout the state, are two of his 
most important reforms. 

Although the life of a war correspondent 
might perhaps be treated with keener appre- 
ciation and sympathy by a soldier or a journal- 
ist than by a clergyman, yet it would be ungra- 
cious to find serious fault with this interesting 
volume from Dr. Griffis's practised pen. In 
giving dates, if he had oftener added the year 
to the month and day of the month, his narra- 
tive would have gained somewhat in clearness 
at least for the reviewer, who is as likely 
to read a book through backward as forward. 
Perhaps, however, it was to discourage such 
discourteous treatment of a good book that its 
author made his chronology intelligible only to 
those who had read carefully from the begin-

THE PHILIPPINES AS THEY ARE.* 

The great timeliness and pertinence of the 
information contained in Professor Worcester's 
account of " The Philippine Islands and Their 
People " give it an insistent claim to careful 
attention. The author, a professor of zoology 
in the University of Michigan, was a part of 
two extended expeditions to the Philippines in 
the interests of science, and thus gained inti- 
mate personal knowledge of the more important 
of the islands, their peoples and their resources, 
through the entire archipelago. The former 
of these journeys occupied a little less than 
a year, beginning with September, 1887 ; the 
latter extended over two years and eight months, 
ending in March, 1893. The earlier expedition 
was conducted independently, and aroused much

of Personal Observation and Experience, with a Short History

hostility among Spanish officials ; the other had 
diplomatic sanction, and was constantly aided 
by the colonial government. The opportunities 
of Dr. Worcester were therefore exceptional for 
providing information needful for the instruc- 
tion of the American nation at the present time. 
The book is fairly exhaustive without degener- 
ating into mere detail and statistic, and its 
contents are informed with a spirit of disin- 
terestedness and candor worthy of high praise. 
At the same time it answers, and authoritatively, 
many questions which every conscientious citi- 
zen is just now asking himself. 

The Philippine Islands, Dr. Worcester tells 
us, have rich natural resources, both mineral 
and agricultural. But the obstacles to their 
development are very great. No white man can 
work there and expect to live ; while native labor 
is hard to get and every way unsatisfactory. The 
climate is especially severe on white women 
and children. " It is very doubtful," he says, 
" if many successive generations of European 
or American children could be raised there." 
Among the diseases that prevail, he enumerates 
malaria, cholera, calentura, small -pox (that 
inevitable accompaniment of the flag of Spain), 
leprosy, and a host more of dreadful afflictions, 
including the horrible biri-biri. There are also 
to be found plagues of ants, which devour any- 
thing ; of locusts, which consume the crops ; 
of poisonous serpents, though, as we are 
informed, there is only one of the inhabited 
islands where the number of deaths from snake- 
bite reaches alarming proportions; of crocodiles 
in the fresh waters and sharks in the sea. The 
land as a whole is subject to earthquakes, and 
is all of volcanic origin, having active volcanoes 
from which have spread wide areas of desola- 
tion in a not remote past. 

There are some eighty varieties of mankind 
on these islands. The dominating race is the 
one called Moros, a fighting and slaveholding 
people, of the stock of the head-hunters of 
Borneo, of the religion of the Mad Mullah 
or El Mahdi. One of the long-standing tasks 
of Spain in the Philippines has been to restrain 
these Malayan pirates from preying upon the 
more peaceful races. They have been con- 
tinuously in revolt since 1622, and their char- 
acteristics have given rise to an expressive 
Spanish proverb which is about the equivalent 
of our English saying that " There are no good 
Indians but dead ones." Our author gives 
many incidents, from his own experience, illus- 
trating their savagery. One of the chiefs or 
head men of the Moros, learning that Dr. Wor-

cester desired to study some of the slaves or 
captives, calmly proposed to shoot a few of them 
for his greater convenience, and as a contri- 
bution to his store of specimens. 

Into the abuses of the Spanish friars in these 
islands, Dr. Worcester does not go, contenting 
himself with quoting from Mr. John Foreman's 
book, for the reason that this authority on the 
Philippines, an English .Catholic, may use a can- 
dor impossible to an American of another be- 
lief at this time. These abuses, it is well to say 
here, arise in great part from the holding and 
dispensing of benefices, a time-worn practice 
which went far toward producing the Lutheran 
revolt, its manifest objections having been recog- 
nized by the Tridentine Council, which strictly 
forbade the process. These remote islands, being 
in portions infidelibus y are not subject to the 
decrees of the Council. Nearly half of the eight 
or ten millions of souls in the archipelago are 
in the hands of these friars, whose energies are 
concentrated in Manila, where their directing 
councils appear as the heads of enormously 
wealthy and influential corporations of a purely 
religious character. The significant fact is worth 
recalling here that the title to all the landed and 
other property of the Church of Rome in the 
Philippines has been transferred since Dewey's 
victory to a distinguished American citizen, 
John Gibbons, Cardinal Archbishop of Balti- 
more. Dr. Worcester tells us that the religious 
propaganda has made but little headway among 
the Christian-hating Moros, and expresses the 
conviction that " the nation which would have 
any hope of getting on peaceably with them 
must let their religion strictly alone" Those 
Americans who favor the annexation of these 
islands on missionary grounds will not find 
much encouragement in Dr. Worcester's book. 
Force, rather than moral suasion, seems to be 
what these troublesome semi-savages require. 
" It is certain," says Dr. Worcester, " that for 
many years to come they must be held in check 
with a strong hand." 

Nor will the advocates of " expansion " or 
annexation find much of comfort or justifica- 
tion, on any grounds, in these frankly written 
pages, which are the more convincing as coming 
from a trained observer who records his experi- 
ences and conclusions in the spirit of science 
rather than of polemics. Without any pro- 
nounced political standpoint of his own, he gives 
a hundred practical reasons for our leaving these 
alien folks alone, to one in favor of our attempt- 
ing to make American wards or citizens of them. 
It is the fashion of the day to scorn any but 



optimistic views and visions ; but there is an 
older fashion of looking facts in the face, and 
of seeking such light as may be had from the 
lamp of experience before entering upon new 
and perhaps dangerous pathways. Those who 
so confidently assert that America shares with 
Great Britain a racial ability to govern remote 
subject peoples, forget or overlook the fact that 
England attained her present administrative 
skill slowly, painfully, and at a most appalling 
sacrifice of blood and treasure, both her own and 
others' ; as well as the contrasting fact that the 
United States is wholly without any similar ex- 
perience in the past or precedent for the future. 
The hazardous nature of the proposed experi- 
ment in the Philippines, and the appalling 
difficulties that may be expected to attend it, 
become clearly impressed upon us by a reading 
of Dr. Worcester's book. The information it 
contains and the manner of presenting it leave 
us longing for more books of travel by Ameri- 
cans. Not since Dr. Donaldson Smith's account 
of Africa, or Lieutenant Peary's tale of Green- 
land, have we been so instructed or entertained. 
The book has a single fault : its price precludes 
its general distribution among those entitled to 
an opinion upon a most vital point in our na- 
tional policy. J OHN j CULVER.

are both critics and artificers of poetry; but bis work 
had to be sought out in its several places of conceal- 
ment the " Athenaeum," the " Enclopaedia Brit- 
annica," and others and until " The Coming of 
Love " made its appearance early in the present 
year, no book bearing his name was obtainable. 
He has now put forth the prose romance, "Aylwin " 
written at least twenty years ago but hitherto 
unpublished and adds the distinction of the nov- 
elist to that of the poet. We trust that he may 
soon be prevailed upon to make his service to the 
public a triple one by collecting into a volume or 
more those extraordinary essays in poetical criti- 
cism, and those fascinating chapters of personal 
reminiscence, that have for many years provided 
44 The Athenaeum " with the most interesting part 
of its contents. 

Of the critic, poet, and romancer so happily com- 
bined in Mr. Watts-Dunton, we will say frankly 
that the laurels of the first two are greener than 
those of the third. His interpretation of poetry, 
technical and aesthetic, seems to us the finest work 
of its sort that has been done in our time, and 
" The Coming of Love " has shown how well the 
writer can exemplify his own critical principles. 
" Aylwin," on the other hand, although revealing 
the stylist and the philosopher, although suffused 
with the tenderest sentiment and the deepest emo- 
tion, although a distinctly individual utterance and 
fascinating from first to last, does not afford a 
parallel to the severe and flawless art to be found 
in the finest of the poems. It is too rambling, too 
episodical for that ; it is not a well-knit piece of con- 
structive workmanship, but rather a vehicle for the 
conveyance to his readers of an excessively romantic 
view of life and of certain special forms of recon- 
dite lore. Primarily, it is a Romany romance, thus 
taking its place in the small group of works which 
includes " Lavengro " and the " Kriegspiel " of Mr. 
Francis Hindes-Groome. It stands related even 
more closely to the author's own " Coming of Love," 
for the heroine of that poem figures in the novel, 
although in a comparatively unimportant part. Of 
this aspect of the romance we may say that the tri- 
umphant success is scored of enlisting our sympa- 
thetic interest in a race and a dialect not particu- 
larly attractive in themselves, except to the Borro- 
vian elect. The figure of Sinfi Lovell is a creation 
worthy to be classed with that of Isopel Berners, 
and the imaginative literature of the subject offers 
no third figure of equal charm, unless it be that of 
Rhona Boswell in " The Coming of Love." Sec- 
ondarily, "Aylwin" is a protest against materialism, 
a plea for the supreme right of passion, in the fine 
sense of that term. " The ennobling difference be- 
tween one man and another," says Mr. Ruskin, "is 
precisely in this, that one feels more than another." 
Henry Aylwin is not ashamed to feel, and his cre- 
ator is not ashamed for him. The story of his over- 
whelming love for Winifred, of the singleness of 
his aim in the long search for her after she has fled 
demented from his presence, and of the final happy 



reunion between hero and heroine the sanity of 
the latter restored is infinitely pathetic, and does 
nothing but honor to the heart that could project 
so great an emotion into the romance of his fash- 
ioning. It even prepares us to accept, as a necessary 
incident in the working out of the result, the bit of 
charlatanism whereby Winifred is brought back to 
mental equilibrium. There are many other features 
of this remarkable book upon which we would gladly 
comment did space permit upon the magic of its 
style, upon the vision which informs its descriptions 
of natural beauty, and upon the power displayed in 
the treatment of certain of its episodes but prob- 
ably enough has been said to make clear the fact 
that " Aylwin " is a book apart from the generality 
of current literary production, a piece of imagina- 
tive work so original as almost to evade classification, 
a book to read with the closest care and to treasure 
for repeated reading in the future. 

" Wild Eelin " is a tale of familiar very familiar 
scenes and types of character, and we know before- 
hand that it assures us several hours of the most pleas- 
ant companionship. Mr. Black's heroines are always 
sweet and maidenly, with a wilding grace of their 
own that quite justifies his lovers for their infatu- 
ation, and makes their misconduct when such may 
be laid to their charge peculiarly atrocious and 
unpardonable. In the present instance they behave 
very well for there are two of them and one 
does not exactly see which of them should rightfully 
possess the prize. Mr. Black does not seem to see, 
either, for he finds no way out of the difficulty save 
that of making " Wild Eelin " catch cold and die 
incontinently. This sudden tragedy at the end is 
altogether uncalled-for, and plays with wanton bru- 
tality upon our emotions. Why not let one of the 
lovers die instead? Mr. Black is as good as ever 
in picturing West Scotland scenery and character, in 
making effective use of snatches of folk-poetry, and 
in infusing a tender sentiment into his scenes and 
situations. We hope to read his often-told tale in 
yet as many more forms as these that have already 
been given it by his ingenious invention. 

" Roden's Corner " is a " corner " in the commer- 
cial or economic sense. It is a corner in malgamite, 
which we are told is an essential ingredient in the 
manufacture of paper. The preparation of malga- 
mite is a serious matter for the workman, since the 
chemicals employed result in poisoning and early 
death. Roden and a fellow-schemer, both unscru- 
pulous, corner the production of malgamite, and start 
their consolidated works in Holland, among the sand- 
dunes of Scheveningen. The real nature of the manu- 
facture is so masked that what is destined to be an 
enormously profitable business appeals to the British 
public as a charity, and gets " boomed " into promi- 
nence. It is represented that the new process of 
manufacture saves lives instead of destroying them. 
A peer of the realm lends his name (for a consider- 
ation) to the enterprise, and all goes well until the 
honest but at first unsuspecting partners learn the 
sort of business in which they are really engaged.

After a sharp tight, the enterprise is broken up, and 
the surviving workmen are pensioned for life out 
of the accrued profits. The story thus outlined has 
a certain interest, but it is badly put together, and 
there is too much dropping of one set of threads to 
take up another. Some of the threads thus dropped 
never get taken up again, and the book is closed with 
a great sense of dissatisfaction. In detail, the work- 
manship is excellent, but as a whole, it seems to us 
very defective. 

In " The Castle Inn " Mr. Wey man contrives to 
get along without the historical accessories that have 
lent interest to his earlier novels, and tells, never- 
theless, a surprisingly interesting story of love and 
private adventure. To be sure, the environment is 
in a sense historical, for it is that of eighteenth cent- 
ury England, and the story is concerned with the 
manners, although not with the actual events, of its 
period. One historical figure, indeed that of the 
great Earl of Chatham makes a casual appearance 
in these pages, but there is no attempt to delineate 
him. The " castle inn " of the tale is somewhere on 
the road to Bristol, in the West of England ; here the 
scene is chiefly laid, and here the actors meet to play 
their several parts. The story is of a young woman 
of humble surroundings, supposed to be the heiress 
to a great fortune, and sought after, both on this and 
other accounts, by a number of men. The story 
of her abduction by one of them and her rescue by 
another provides the narrative with its central situa- 
tion, and her marriage is a triumph for romantic 
principles, since she turns out penniless after all, yet 
is wooed and won by the rather dandified hero, who 
exceeds any expectations reasonably to be deduced 
from his training and early life. The story is, we 
repeat, skilfully put together and entertaining, repro- 
ducing in a vivid manner the social life and ideals 
of the Georgian epoch in English history. 

Mr. Robert Barr has always known how to tell a 
good story, but he has outdone himself in " Tekla," 
his latest production. This romance of love, war, 
and archepiscopal politics of the thirteenth century 
is one of the best quasi-historical tales that we have 
read for many moons. The chief figures in this 
work are Rudolf I., the first Hapsburg emperor ; 
Arnold von Isenburg, the primate of Treves ; and 
Konrad von Hochstaden, his colleague of Cologne. 
Beyond these names, and a general truthfulness to 
the spirit of the period, there is little that is histor- 
ical in the book. The Emperor is represented as a 
far stronger man than history admits him to have 
been, and the story is based upon an imaginary 
episode placed in the beginning of his reign. Falling 
in love with a ward of the grim ruler of Treves, he 
aids her flight to the castle of her uncle on the 
Moselle, and, his name and rank unknown to all 
concerned, he remains in the castle and defends it 
against the allied Archbishops of Treves and Co- 
logne during a siege of two years. How the castle 
is held, how Rudolf wins the love of Tekla, how, 
at the right moment, he collects the imperial forces 
and raises the siege, and how, restored to his throne 



in Frankfurt, he humbles the proud prelates who 
had thought him but a puppet in their hands, all 
this is told in some four hundred pages of the most 
engrossing romantic narrative. If the story is at 
times lacking in animation, and the dialogue some- 
what over-labored, there is, nevertheless, no doubt 
of the thrilling interest which attaches to the tale 
from first to last. 

" The Adventures of Francois " is at once a de- 
lightful surprise and a stronger proof than the 
author has ever before given us of his versatility as 
a writer of fiction. We had thought Dr. Mitchell to 
have touched his high-water mark with " Hugh 
Wynne," but even that admirable novel is surpassed 
by the present masterpiece of picaresque invention. 
In Dr. Mitchell's previous books there has always 
been a certain strenuousness, and a slightly labored 
character has pertained to the best of them. While 
giving deserved praise to their conscientiousness 
and unfailing taste, we have never been able to 
escape the impression that their author was too 
intent upon becoming a great novelist to achieve the 
best sort of success. No such impression as this is 
produced by " The Adventures of Francois," which 
is distinguished by an almost absolute freedom of 
movement The author has found a medium in 
which he is not impeded by external friction ; his 
narrative takes shape and color from within ; it is 
the genuine projection of a finely-realized creation 
of character. The hero is a foundling, thief, jug- 
gler, and fencing-master who lives in Paris during 
the period of the Revolution. " He had a great 
heart and no conscience ; was fond of flowers, of 
birds, and of children ; pleased to chat of his pilfer- 
ings, liking the fun of the astonishment he thus 
caused. . . . He was by nature gifted with affec- 
tion, good sense, and courage. He had many deli- 
cacies of character, but that of which nature meant 
to make a gentleman and a man of refinement, de- 
sertion and evil fortune made a thief and a repro- 
bate." These sentences are the author's own sum- 
mary of one of the most interesting and lovable 
characters in recent fiction, and they but faintly 
reflect the singular charm of this vagabond hero, 
who was all unconsciously mixed up with some of 
the greatest happenings in history, and whose career 
illustrates a phase of the Revolutionary period of 
which the writers of rhetorical romances seem quite 
unconscious. Even the most hackneyed features of 
the Terror become fresh in their interest when 
viewed from the standpoint of this child of nature, 
while his experiences and vicissitudes are surprising 
enough to keep the attention agog from beginning 
to end. Nothing that Dr. Mitchell has heretofore 
done deserves so cordial a greeting as this altogether 
delightful story. 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, whose reputation as * 
writer of short stories and novelettes has so long been 
established, has now attempted work upon a more 
ambitions scale, and has given us, in " Red Rock," 
one of the most satisfactory works of fiction that the 
South has ever produced. On all this crowded canvas

there is not a figure that is not drawn from the life, 
and given character by sympathy or insight into 
motive. The types delineated are not new, but they 
are thoroughly realized in accordance with the con- 
ventional models, and their fortunes are so skilfully 
interwoven as to make them present a vivid and 
trustworthy view of human nature in Virginia be- 
fore and after the war. We say in Virginia, for 
although Mr. Page disclaims any attribution of a 
local habitation for his characters, it is pretty evident 
that they are taken from the society that he knows 
so well, to say nothing of the indications of prox- 
imity to the Capital which would hardly fit in with 
the suggestion of any other State. The real theme 
of " Red Rock " is the work of reconstruction the 
task so well-intentioned but so badly performed 
because undertaken and carried out by doctrinaires 
who knew nothing of the problems to be dealt with. 
The era of carpet-bagging is one of the blots upon 
our national history ; and, at the present distance 
of an entire generation, one may, without being 
suspected of disloyalty to the Union, make that 
admission. Of the horrors of that reign of terror, 
and of the struggle of the whites for the preserva- 
tion of civilization when menaced by an even greater 
curse than war, no stronger delineation than this 
has thus far found its way into our literature. Mr. 
Page's sympathies are passionately Southern, and 
we have no doubt that this fact colors his narrative 
to some extent that his Virginians are of finer 
mould, and his carpet-baggers more despicable, than 
the average truth would warrant ; but the fact re- 
mains that the Northern policy of reconstruction, in 
the hands of the politicians who were intrusted with 
its details, was carried out with a degree of tactless- 
ness, and even of brutality, that left behind it a 
deeper bitterness than the victory of the Union arms 
alone could have produced. We can meet the au- 
thor more than half way in his indignation, and 
thank him for his attempt to make us understand 
what it meant for the civilization of a Southern State 
to place the reins of civil government in the hands 
of men who were utterly unfit to direct its course. 
And it is hardly to be laid up against Mr. Page that, 
in his endeavor to arouse our sympathies for the 
people among whom he was reared, he should endow 
them with more of the manly and womanly virtues 
than ever yet fell to the lot of any section of American 
society. To do this was his duty as a novelist, and 
we are quite prepared to accept his idealized picture 
as good art, if not exactly the best of realism. 

We will close this review of an unusually import- 
ant selection of recent novels with a few words about 
the late Harold Frederic's " Gloria Mundi." We 
have read it with disappointment, for it is inferior 
to several of Frederic's earlier books, and for a reason 
not far to seek. In attempting to write of English 
society and particularly of a section of that society 
with which he had no intimate associations he ex- 
ceeded his powers, and allowed the journalist in him 
to get the better of the artist. But all the devices 
of the most resourceful and inventive journalism 



make a poor substitute for observation, and no 
amount of reading or talking about people, however 
earnestly or cleverly done, will suffice for depicting 
them as the novelist should. The lords and ladies 
of this novel are lay figures merely ; they are sketched 
from the outside and at a distance ; they have noth- 
ing of the glow and the vitality of the figures in the 
author's American novels. Even the hero, in whose 
case something more closely approaching the cre- 
ative effect has been reached, remains baffling and 
elusive ; one never knows just what he thinks or 
what he is going to do. Nor is the story helped by 
the vein of didacticism that runs through it. A part 
of the narrative deals with a Ruskinian social sys- 
tem the hobby of one of the minor characters 
but of this we must say that either too much or too 
little is made. We cannot find out whether or not 
the author believes in it, yet the prominence given 
it warrants a reader in asking the question. What 
we have said should not be taken as a condemnation 
of the story ; we mean simply that it is by no means 
as good a story as Harold Frederic knew how to write. 
But it is always an interesting, and, in some of its 
episodes, a brilliant piece of narrative invention.

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 



n. 

Mr. Eric Pape's drawings in Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.'s luxurious new edition of General Wal- 
lace's " The Fair God " are, like the novel itself, the 
result of imagination working upon the fruits of anti- 
quarian research. Mr. Pape has been at great pains 
to secure for his pictures the highest degree of realism 
attainable. He has ransacked museums and libraries, 
and he has travelled widely in the countries in which 
the story is laid, retracing the steps of Cortes, and 
gathering with the aid of pencil and camera sketches 
and views of the relics of ancient Mexican civiliza- 
tion. Native Mexican Indians have served as models 
for the more imaginative and dramatic drawings. 
The decorative designs subserve the purpose of repre- 
senting the arts and implements of the Aztecs, and 
of their tribal predecessors who inhabited Mexico 
and Central America centuries before their regime 
in ancient Anahuac. The initials in red and black 
have a good effect, and on the whole, considering the 
inherent difficulties of his undertaking, Mr. Pape 
must be said to have scored a decided success. The 
full-page pictures are of somewhat uneven merit, 
ranging from such fine ones as that facing page 40 
of Volume I., to the comparatively weak example 
facing page 86 of Volume II. But the pictorial 
average is very creditable to Mr. Pape. Outwardly 
the volumes are gotten up in impeccable style, the 
chaste yet sufficiently decorative bindings being par- 
ticularly good. The work ranks among the hand- 
somest of the holiday publications of this year.

the sympathetic and skilled illustrator saturated with 
the spirit of his author is exemplified in The Century 
CO.'B remarkable folio edition of " The Pilgrim's Pro- 
gress " of Bunyan, illustrated by the brothers Rhead 
George, Louis, and Frederick. The original de- 
signs of these pictures were exhibited in New York 
and London some time ago, and there was a general 
desire then to see them made popularly attainable 
in their present form. These strong drawings over 
which the spirit of allegory appropriately broods are 
really Bunyanesque such drawings as the Inspired 
Tinker himself might have been glad to see wedded 
to his immortal text. The high average of merit is 
well sustained, though the artist's fancy seems to 
flag in the plates facing pages 66, 139, and 78, 
which seem relatively insipid. Notably good are the 
plates showing Vanity Fair, the home of " Pliable," 
" Talkative " on the ale-bench and in his household, 
the Slough of Despond. Hogarth himself might 
have drawn the Jurymen of Louis Rhead, and Dor 
could not have bettered George Rhead's "Giant 
Despair." Very felicitous are tbe personifications 
" The Lord Luxurious," " Mr. Worldly-Wiseman," 
" Tbe Lord Carnal-Delight," etc. There are thirty- 
six full-page illustrations, and seventy or more vig- 
nettes, together with a number of purely decorative 
designs, headbands, initials, marginal borders, etc., 
the whole printed in brown ink on rather heavy 
paper. There is an Edition de luxe of this work, 
but the very moderate price of the regular edition 
puts these highly satisfactory illustrations within 
reach of all. 

Of the seven historic trails that cross the great 
plains of the interior of this continent, the old Santa 
Fe* route has the most stirring and romantic story. 
That story has already been picturesquely told by 
Colonel Henry Inman. Encouraged by the success 
of that work, he now puts forth a kindred volume 
containing the story of the second in interest of 
these primitive highways of the far west, "The 
Great Salt Lake Trail " (Macmillan). Col. W. F. 
Cody, popularly known as " Buffalo Bill," is joint 
author of the volume, and his quota has at least the 
distinctive merit of being drawn mainly from its 
narrator's own experience. The frontispiece, a cap- 
ital photographic plate, shows the two collaborators 
bending over a chart of the storied route over which 
so many adventurous pilgrims made their way to 
the now populous valley of the salted inland sea. 
Most interesting, perhaps, of these pioneering ad- 
venturers were the Mormons ; and to the trials of 
these sectaries during their arduous march Colonel 
Inman devotes some interesting, let us add char- 
itable, pages. The Salt Lake Trail was also the 
route followed by the expeditions of Fremont, S tans- 
bury, and Lander, and by the famous Pony Express, 
with its lumbering colleague, the Overland Stage. 
It is to the annals of the Trail in this its romantic 
period, long before a railway through the wilderness 
of sage-brush and alkali dust was thought possible, 
that Colonel Inman's story is devoted. It is hardly 
proper to call it a story : it is rather a collection 



of stories an informal conglomerate of frontier 
yarns and pen-pictures of frontier characters. The 
work has little claim to literary style ; it is essentially 
history in the rough, and fixes for the use of the future 
historian the salient features of a phase of peculiarly 
American life and manners now fading into history. 
The echoes of that stirring period are already dying ; 
for America is preeminently the land of change. 
" The Great Salt Lake Trail " is a book that Young 
America, especially, will relish and profit by. It 
contains seven full-page illustrations by F. Colburn 
Clarke, together with many rather roughly executed 
cuts in the text A map of the Trail is of course 
included. 

If we should ever have an Omar Khayyam Club 
in America, Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole should be 
made its president by acclamation. His " Vari- 
orum " edition of Omar, so comprehensively planned 
and so skilfully edited ; his " Bilingual " edition, so 
happily conceived and so prettily executed ; and 
now, the holiday edition edited by him for Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co., are titles to the aforementioned 
presidency such as no other American could offer. 
(We do not mention Mr. Vedder because he lives 
in Rome.) The edition to which reference has just 
been made gives a full reprint of the first, second, 
and fifth versions of the quatrains, together with 
the variants found in the two others. It includes 
the regular FitzGerald essay and notes, besides an 
introductory paper and other apparatus supplied by 
the present editor. The volume is beautifully 
printed and bound, and has for illustrations, be- 
sides the frontispiece portrait of FitzGerald, twelve 
original photo-etchings by Mr. Gilbert James and 
Mr. Edmund H. Garrett Mr. James adopts a 
decorative style of design, which proves effective. 
Mr. Garret, on the other hand, resorts to romantic 
idealization, and achieves prettiness in every case, 
and something more than prettiness in the cases in 
which he allows himself to be influenced by Mr. 
Vedder's work. In other words, he is best when 
he is frankly imitative. There is no more charming 
book than this offered for the holiday season. 

One of the most sumptuous and sterling of the 
solider publications of the season is the new illus- 
trated edition of Mr. John Fiske's The Beginnings 
of New England" (Houghton). Of the original 
merits of Mr. Fiske's standard historical study we 
need not speak ; and of the pictorial element now 
added little need be said beyond stating that the 
governing principle of illustration is the sound one 
followed in the same author's " The American Revo- 
lution." In the newer work, as in the older one, 
the pictures are real lights on the text, and absolute 
and material additions to the graphic quality and 
historical richness of the work. In the matter of 
portraits the present volume unavoidably falls some- 
what short, in point of comprehensiveness, of its 
well equipped predecessor, for the reason that in 
a number of cases authentic originals are lacking. 
We miss, for instance, from Mr. Fiske's interesting 
gallery such worthies as William Bradford, Roger

Williams, and Thomas Hooker. On the other hand, 
there are a few agreeable surprises in the way of 
hitherto unpublished portraits notably an attrac- 
tive one of Goffe, the regicide. Very interesting are 
the photographic reproductions of quaint title-pages, 
facsimiles of notable documents and sign manuals 
among the latter the " marks " of Miantomo, of Uncas 
and Squaw, of King Philip, etc. But we cannot 
attempt here to convey a fair notion of the pictorial 
scope and interest of this noble publication. The 
portraits are mainly full-page photogravures, which 
serve at once to embellish and illustrate this well con- 
ceived, elegant volume. 

The title of Mrs. Mary Knight Potter's tasteful 
little book, " Love in Art " (L. C. Page & Co.), has 
afforded a wide scope of choice in the matter of illus- 
tration. There are thirty-six plates in all, and the 
subjects have been well selected. The bulk of the 
pictures are photographic reproductions of well- 
known masterpieces, such as the Venus of Melos, 
the Cupid of Praxiteles, Correggio's Education of 
Cupid, Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Botticelli's Birth of 
Venus, etc.; but the inclusion of such works as The 
Lovers by Mrs. Kenyon Cox, Thumann's Springtime 
of Love, Brush's Mother and Child, and Millais's 
The Bride of Lammermoor, indicates at least some 
independence of taste on the author's part, and im- 
parts a popular flavor to the book. A taste that 
might find Botticelli unpalatable will find its account 
in Millais and Thumann. The author writes intelli- 
gently for the behoof of the general reader, with 
whom this comely volume should find ready accept- 
ance. The handsome print and delicate binding are 
especially noteworthy. The same firm publish in 
similar style Mrs. Clara Erskine Clement's " Angels 
in Art." This popularly instructive and attractively 
illustrated book sustains Mrs. Clement's reputation 
as a discriminating and well informed writer in her 
chosen field. The illustrations are selected with irre- 
proachable taste. There are thirty-four of them in 
all, and nothing is included that the judicious reader 
is likely to wish away. This publication is certainly 
among the prettiest as well as the soundest moderate- 
priced art books on our list. 

A handsome book packed with information as to 
the household economy of Colonial times is Mrs. 
Alice Morse Earle's " Home Life in Colonial Days " 
(Macmillan). The work is mainly and essentially 
an antiquarian account of the tools, implements, and 
utensils, as well as the processes, of Colonial domestic 
industry ; and it is full enough to serve as a moderate 
encyclopaedia in that kind. The feature of the book, 
it is perhaps fair to say, is the illustrations ; and 
a glance over the long list of these is enough to show 
to our modern view how remarkably self-sustaining 
and self-sufficing in respect of its material needs the 
Colonial family was. Nearly everything worn or used 
was made at home. The " boughten " article was 
a comparative rarity; and the daughter of the 
well-regulated household was necessarily mistress 
of a score of small handicrafts. Mrs. Earle's pic- 
tures are in every case, as she tells us, " from real 



articles and scenes, usually from those still in exist- 
ence rare relics of past days. . . . Many a curious 
article as nameless and incomprehensible as the 
totem of an extinct Indian tribe has been studied, 
compared, inquired about, and finally triumphantly 
named and placed in the list of obsolete domestic ap- 
purtenances. From the lofts of woodsheds, under attic 
eaves, in dairy cellars, out of old trunks and sea-chests 
from mouldering warehouses, have strangely shaped 
bits and combinations of wood, stuff, and metal been 
rescued and recognized." This useful and attractive 
book, with its profuse and interesting pictures, its 
fair typography, and its quaint binding imitative of 
an old-time sampler, should prove a holiday favorite. 

A pretty book with a " catchy " title, that will 
undoubtedly prove a prime favorite this season, is 
Mr. Alexander Black's "Miss America" (Scrib- 
ner), a collection of pen and camera sketches of types 
of the American Girl. Mr. Black appears to have 
more than a speaking acquaintance with his subject. 
He writes cleverly and with a vein of shrewd phil- 
osophy ; and he is plainly an adept with the camera. 
The pictures are decidedly attractive of course. 
They strike us as a fairly representative lot ; and 
we commend them to the American young man for 
careful inspection. They will refresh his patriot- 
ism, and make him glad that he was not born else- 
where. Outwardly, the volume is most enticing 
the prettiest and daintiest possible gift-book for Miss 
America herself. The cover is of pale-blue, with 
a medallion design showing one of the author's 
most bewitching types. 

In his interestingly illustrated book entitled 
" Woods and Dales of Derbyshire " (G. W. Jacobs 
& Co.), the Rev. James S. Stone tells of his summer 
ramblings in that storied English county during the 
summer of 1892. Dr. Stone started on his tour 
with the mental equipment necessary to its full and 
intelligent enjoyment. He saw what was best worth 
seeing, and he writes suggestively and entertain- 
ingly, and with the due sprinkling of anecdote. 
We commend the book especially to tourists in the 
county described. It will serve both as guide-book 
and companion. There are a number of half-tone 
photographic plates of fair interest and quality. 

One of the most distinctive of the season's gift- 
books is Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie's graceful literary 
fantasy, "In the Forest of Arden" (Dodd), deco- 
rated by Mr. Will H. Low. Mr. Low's decorative 
work, head and tail pieces, scattered sprays and gar- 
lands of leaves and flowers, marginal borders, etc., 
all printed in light-brown ink, is perhaps the best 
of its class this season. The clever full-page designs 
are conceived in the spirit of the text. We have 
nothing but praise for this specimen of delicate, 
artistic book-making. 

Replete with tender Christian sentiment and 
singularly in harmony with the spirit of the great 
Church festival is Dr. Henry Van Dyke's delicately 
fancied Christmas legend of "The Lost Word" 
(Scribner). The scene is laid in Antioch in the 
time of the eloquent John, famous in Church his-

tory as Chrysostom. The hero of the tale is 
Hermas, one of the golden youth of Antioch, con- 
verted by John, and in consequence disinherited 
by his father, the rich pagan, Demetrius. The 
story turns upon the lapse of Hermas into paganism, 
and his eventual return to the fold of the faithful. 
The "Lost Word" is "God" a precious talis- 
man that is completely erased from the memory of 
the youth during the period of his apostasy, through 
the arts of the pagan sorcerer Marcion, yet sorely 
needed at intervals of despair and threatened be- 
reavement, when the echo of a prayer struggles to 
his lips. He can utter his petition, indeed but 
to whom ? He gropes vainly in memory for the 
" Lost Word," until it is too late. The story closes 
with the appearance of Chrysostom at the bedside 
of the child of Hermas, who has been thrown from 
his father's chariot during the races at Hippodrome. 
Hermas, heart-broken, is praying that the boy's life 
may be spared ; but again the precious word eludes 
his memory. Chrysostom supplies it, just as the 
soul of the little sufferer is about to take flight; 
and the prayer is answered. The story is grace- 
fully told, and the allegory is not too obtrusive. 
The volume is chastely decorative in style, and con- 
tains four pleasing photogravures after the designs 
of Mr. Corwin Knapp Linson. 

The delightful Dent edition of " The Ingoldsby 
Legends " (Macmillan) should prove one of the 
season's favorites. The several series are hand- 
somely printed in one handy octavo volume, which 
is prefaced by a brief introductory sketch of 
Barham by Mr. F. J. Simmons. The illustrator is 
Mr. Arthur Rack ham, and he has made the most of 
his excellent opportunities. There are fourteen full- 
page plates in colors, and ninety-five vignettes in 
black-and-white. Mr. Rack ham's work is very spir- 
ited, some of it (notably in the text cuts) being 
quite up to the work of the older tribe of illus- 
trators on wood " Phiz," Cruikshank, and the 
rest. Mr. Rack ham has taken pains to understand 
his author. The half comic, half grewsome spirit 
characteristic of Barbara's curious medley is per- 
fectly caught, and altogether Mr. Rackham's pic- 
tures form a needed and welcome condiment to these 
old favorites. The book is manufactured in the usual 
flawless taste of its publishers. 

One of the pretty books that come to us from 
time to time with the imprint of the Roycroft Shop 
is entitled " Love Letters of a Musician," and Miss 
Myrtle Reed is the author. It is a series of rhap- 
sodical outpourings, addressed to his lady love by a 
young violinist, and filled with dreamy and tender 
passion. Their secondary theme (for love is the 
first) is not so much music as nature, and the writer 
seems to spend his spare hours in the woods and 
field*, watching the annual procession of harvests 
and flowers, and finding in them a new inspiration 
for both his art and his love. An excess of senti- 
mentality sometimes mars the writing, and Miss 
Reed has not yet learned to avoid certain desper- 
ately hackneyed words and phrases, but the feeling 



of her book is sincere, and her observation of nature 
singularly truthful. She is a young woman from 
whom excellent work may be expected, a prediction 
that we make with a confidence based not only 
upon the present production, but also upon a few 
stray poems to which her name is attached, and 
which we have noticed in periodical publications 
here and there. 

A brace of notably tasteful little volumes, either 
or both of them forming a suitable and modest gift 
for a friend of musical tastes, are Mr. Louis C. Elson's 
"Great Composers and their Work," and Mr. Henry 
C. Lahee's " Famous Singers of To-Day and Yester- 
day " (L. C. Page & Co. ). Mr. Elson gives a series 
of brief biographical notices, well spiced with anec- 
dote, of noted composers, beginning with the earliest 
ones known to fame, and running the gamut in chro- 
nological order down to the notabilities of the pres- 
ent day. The same description will serve, mutatis 
mutandis, for Mr. Lahee's book. Both authors write 
pleasantly and intelligently but one is surprised 
to find Mr. Elson speaking of one of his musical 
worthies as " the first party who fairly deserves," 
etc. The italics are ours. The volumes are finely 
printed on good paper, and each contains a generous 
quota of well - executed portraits. The bindings 
in maroon and gilt are especially rich and well 
designed. 

Mr. Orson Lowell is the illustrator of the Mac- 
millan Co.'s holiday edition of Mr. James Lane 
Allen's fine story, " The Choir Invisible." Mr. 
Lowell's pictures consist of eight washed drawings 
reproduced in photogravure, and a number of pen 
sketches, full-page and vignette. Except in one or 
two cases (notably the strong plate facing page 68) 
the wash drawings lack depth or distance, but the 
general effect is pleasing, and altogether the pic- 
tures should enhance the reader's enjoyment of the 
book. The text is fairly printed on smooth paper, 
and the cover design of conventionalized flowers is 
graceful and effective. 

Dr. Theodore F. Wolfe's pleasant volumes about 
the homes of famous authors have won so much 
favor, and deservingly, that he has prepared a new 
collection of studies in similar vein. It is entitled 
"Literary Haunts and Homes" (Lippincott), and 
is devoted to American authors Mr. Kipling 
being dragged in by virtue of his temporary so- 
journ in Vermont. The " haunts " of Poe, Bryant, 
Cooper, Whitman, and many others, are described, 
and four engravings provide the text with illustra- 
tions. 

An elegant and suitable gift to a clerical friend 
will be found in the two rather sumptuous volumes 
entitled " The Cathedrals of England " ( Whittaker). 
Each volume contains a series of historical and 
descriptive papers on England's most famous min- 
sters, liberally illustrated with pen-drawings by 
Mr. Herbert Railton and others. Volume I. opens 
with a characteristic paper by Archdeacon Farrar on 
Westminster Abbey, which is followed by briefer 
accounts of Canterbury, Durham, Wells, Lincoln,

Winchester, and Gloucester Cathedrals, by Canon 
Freemantle, Canon Talbot, Mr. S. M. S. Pereira, 
Dr. Venables, Canon Benham, and the Dean of Glou- 
cester, respectively. Volume II. is devoted to St. 
Paul's Cathedral, York Minster, St. Alban's Abbey, 
and Ely, Norwich, Salisbury, Worcester, and Exeter 
Cathedrals. The volumes are richly bound in purple 
and white cloth stamped with a suitable design in gilt, 
and are enclosed in stout slip-covers. 

The Macmillan Co.'s comely two-volume edition 
of Cooper's " The Last of the Mohicans," with 
twenty-four colored plates by H. M. Brock, forms 
a very acceptable gift-book for a boy, as well as an 
attractive medium through which the older reader 
may renew his acquaintance with this old favorite 
of romantic fiction. Print and paper are good, 
and Mr. Brock's designs are pleasing, and not so 
determinedly realistic as to be out of harmony with 
his author. The cover is dull red, with a notably 
good side ornament in gilt and black. 

"Cathedral Bells" (William R. Jenkins) is a 
copiously illustrated flat oblong volume containing a 
detailed account, by the Rev. John Talbot Smith, of 
that striking architectural exotic, St. Patrick's 
Cathedral of New York. Mr. Walter Russell is the 
illustrator, and he has supplied a liberal number of 
plates that should interest the class likely to be 
attracted by the volume. Besides views of the 
Cathedral, exterior and interior, there are a number 
of portraits of prominent ecclesiastics Archbishops 
Hughes, McCloskey, and Corrigan, Rectors Quinn, 
Lavelle, etc. The wide margins are decorated with 
details of architecture and mural and window paint- 
ing, knick-knacks of ecclesiastical dress and equip- 
ment, etc. The liberal tone of the text will com- 
mend the book to Protestant readers, who will find 
it an instructive and intelligent account of the noble 
pile that lends an element of antique dignity and 
distinction to New York's magnificent thoroughfare. 

New editions of the " Rubiiiyiit " have been legion 
of late, but we are nevertheless glad to welcome the 
Edition de liuxe of FitzGerald's translation just pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. The volume is a large 
octavo, bound in green sateen, with an elaborate 
cover design in gold. The quatrains are printed two 
to a page, each pair being enclosed by a striking deco- 
rative border, drawn by Mr. W. B. Macdougall, an 
artist whose work is prominent in more than one of 
the holiday publications this year. The designs have 
been engraved on wood, and the printing is done 
from the original blocks in a manner that could 
hardly be improved upon. The volume is issued in 
a limited edition of 1000 copies, and is dedicated to 
the members of the Omar Khayyam Club of London. 

Bubbling over with fun and instinct with the sunny 
and jocund spirit of the artist is " The Frank Lock- 
wood Sketch Book" (London: Edward Arnold), an 
oblong quarto containing a selection from the pen- 
and-ink drawings of the late Sir Frank Lockwood. 
The sketches are chance jottings, largely playful cari- 
catures of well-known people, thrown off by the artist 
as the humor seized him. They remind one some- 



times of Leech, but of tener of Thackeray ; and they 
evince at their best considerable technical skill of the 
rough-and-ready order. But the best part of them 
is their unfailing good temper their stingless fun 
at the expense of their author's associates. Indeed, 
so far as they are caricatures, they owe their preser- 
vation mainly to the care of the victims themselves, 
who were always the most eager competitors for their 
possession. The drawings were literally " Fliegende 
Blaetter" scribbled in note-books and diaries and on 
odd scraps of paper, and forgotten by everyone save 
their chance possessor. But they were well worth 
collecting, and the volume containing them is by all 
odds the cleverest and most original thing in its way 
this year. Among the American victims of Sir 
Frank's sportive pencil we note Mr. Cleveland and 
Mr. Olney, Mr. Depew, Mr. Edison, etc. Other draw- 
ings show Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Birrell, 
Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Coleridge, Lord Russell, the 
Tichborne Claimant, Mr. Balf our, and a host of legal 
lights under more or less amusing circumstances. 
Nor did the caricaturist spare himself. He is shown 
in the cover design as being run away with (in wig 
and gown) by a sorry nag, d la Gilpin, and evi- 
dently in anything but " merry pin." A reminis- 
cence, probably. 

The new volume ( the third) of " Life's Comedy," 
published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, is as 
attractive and entertaining as either of its predeces- 
sors, and this is saying a great deal. It is made 
up of drawings selected from the pages of " Life," 
the best of our humorous weeklies, and contains speci- 
mens of the work of some of the most prominent 
black-and-white illustrators of the day. For pure 
diversion, there is no other holiday book of the year 
that can compare with it. 

By adding the element of color to Mr. Hugh 
Thomson's familiar illustrations of "Cranford," 
the Macmillan Co. have acceptably varied their edi- 
tion of Mrs. Gaskell's delightful book. There are 
a hundred drawings in all, forty of them in colors, 
the rest in black-and-white. Mrs. Anne Thackeray 
Ritchie's preface is a welcome adjunct to this pretty 
and convenient edition. 

The bizarre initial stanza that faces the title-page 
of Mr. Oliver Herford's clever booklet of humorous 
verse entitled "The Bashful Earthquake" (Scrib- 
ner) indicates a larger and bolder fancy than is ap- 
parent in the body of the volume. The drop from 
the lines in question to such a bardic flight as the 
following, for instance, is sudden, not to say severe : 

" The Bunnies are a feeble folk 

Whose weakness is their strength. 
To shun a gun a Bun will run 
To almost any length." 

But Mr. Herford's verses, we repeat, are clever, and 
so are his drawings, with which the pages are liber- 
ally peppered. There are forty-nine titles in all. 
The book is temptingly gotten up, and cunningly 
baited with a striking " earthquake " design in colors. 
The Doubleday & McClure Co., in connection with 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. of London, have begun the

publication of a " Temple " edition of Dickens, to be 
complete in 40 volumes. Pickwick " is the first to 
appear, and the convenient form and enticing appear- 
ance of the three trim little volumes containing it 
tempt one strongly to re-read for the twentieth time 
or so this cheery and wholesome old favorite. The 
volumes are bound in Turkey-red flexible leather cov- 
ers, and each contains a frontispiece in colors. The 
set, in its neat box, forms a timely and irreproach- 
able Christmas gift 

Lapses of style and a vein of not very happy jocu- 
larity mar somewhat Mr. Elbert Hubbard's other- 
wise acceptable sheaf of biographical sketches 
entitled " Little Journeys to the Homes of American 
Statesmen " (Putnam). The book conveys, in a 
chatty, off-hand style, a fair amount of elementary 
information concerning the lives and opinions of 
such men as Franklin, Hamilton, Jefferson, Clay, 
Webster, Sam. Adams, etc. The volume is taste- 
fully got up, and the publishers have been liberal in 
point of illustrations, which consist largely of por- 
traits. The frontispiece is a notably good and well- 
executed likeness of Hamilton. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. reissue in new form 
their excellent edition of Walton's " Complete An- 
gler." Mr. Lowell's Introduction is retained, of 
course. This fine essay, the " Angler " proper, and 
Cotton's supplement on fly-fishing, are now included 
in a single delectable yet moderate-priced volume. 
Selected Notes are given at the back, as are the 
familiar Commendatory Verses on Izaak and his 
performance. There is an index, and altogether 
the edition is both comely and convenient. The old 
woodcuts are retained. The volume is of feathery 
lightness, and makes a pleasing show in its dainty 
cover of grass-green and gilt. 

If you have a friend who is a golfer, as of 
course you have, yon can hardly go amiss in se- 
lecting as a gift for him (or her) a copy of " The 
Golfer's Alphabet " (Harper). The humors of the 
" links " are cleverly brought out by both illustra- 
tor and rhymster Mr. A. B. Frost and Mr. W. G. 
Van Sutphen, respectively. There is a rhymed 
couplet with a picture for each letter of the alphabet 
Mr. Frost's " caddies " are especially funny. 

"By the Still Waters" (Crowell), is a comely 
booklet of thirty odd pages containing what its au- 
thor, the Rev. J. R. Miller, styles a Meditation on 
the Twenty-Third Psalm. Dr. Miller's piety is of 
a cheery and wholesome cast, and his meditations 
are judiciously mingled with some telling descrip- 
tions of Oriental scenery, of which the anonymous 
illustrator takes due advantage. There are eleven 
full-page plates and six vignettes, all nicely done. 
The book is neatly bound in pale green with cover- 
design in dark green and gold, and forms a pretty 
gift for a friend of pious turn. 

Notably dainty and enticing are the two small 
volumes of specimens from the poets, entitled " Wit 
and Wisdom from Many Minds " (Putnam). The 
selections are made with taste and with commend- 
able independence of judgment, and the best of the 



humbler poets and the translators especially are not 
slighted. The text is finely printed on good paper, 
and pains have evidently been taken to secure accu- 
racy. One disastrous misprint, however, we note, 
in Butler's description of Holland, which reads 
" A land that rides at anchor, and in moor'd ; 
In which men do not lire but go abroad." 

- Abroad," of course, should be " aboard." The 
volumes are choicely bound in light-green ribbed 
cloth with gilt lettering and tracery. 

The Charming Auxiliary, a worthy philanthropic 
organization of San Francisco, issues each year a 
holiday pamphlet, or brochure, which makes its 
modest appeal, we trust not in vain, to discriminat- 
ing buyers. This year the subject, and a very 
appropriate one, is the late E. R. Sill's poem on 
" Christmas in California," which appears with 
numerous illustrations and decorations from pen- 
drawings by Miss Helen Hyde. The tall, narrow 
leaves are of raw-edged hand-made paper, and the 
soft cover is of Japanese vellum ornamented with 
a graceful design in four colors showing two slightly 
conventionalized calla lilies with illuminated letters 
in the missal style. The drawings evince a delicate 
fancy and considerable artistic promise on the part 
of the illustrator. 

Miss Kate Sanborn's "Starlight Calendar" 
(Houghton) is, properly speaking, a small an- 
thology of striking extracts in prose and verse, 
a pageful of them for each day of the year. The 
collection is a promiscuous one. The authors repre- 
sented range in philosophy from Plato to Joseph 
Cook and in poetry from Milton to Whitcomb Rtley. 
Shakespeare and Eugene Field are excluded from 
Miss Sanborn's pantheon, while Thurlow Weed, 
David Swing, and Tupper are admitted. Helen 
Hunt is perhaps the writer most favored in point 
of space, while Immanuel Kant modestly brings up 
the rear with a line and a half. E. P. Roe is recalled 
from the shades, and there are several pagefuls 
of " Ian Maclaren." Auerbach figures grandly as 
" von " Auerbach. The prevailing cast of the selec- 
tions given is the serious-edificatory, an effect which 
is not relieved by the fact that the compiler of 
the book thoughtfully appends dated blank pages 
whereon " to record the sacred days on which your 
friends have passed through death to life." Not 
a very cheery sort of a Christmas Calendar, we must 
say, but one providing abundant food for sober 
reflection. 

A dainty volume that comes with a certain appro- 
priateness at this season is Messrs. Little, Brown, & 
Co.'s new edition of " The Little Flowers of Saint 
Francis of Assisi," translated from the Italian and 
provided with a brief sketch of Saint Francis by 
Mrs. Abby Langdon Alger. The " Little Flowers " 
are legends of the Umbrian Saint and his disciples, 
and the book has long been a favorite with pious 
souls in Italy and France. The present translation 
was made in 1887, and we are glad to see it in its 
new setting. There are two plates, one after 
Morello's painting in the Milan Gallery, the other 



1898.]

after Giotto's quaint picture of Saint Francis's Ser- 
mon to the Birds. 

There is a good deal of fun of the rough and 
popular kind in Mr. E. W. Kemble's thin oblong 
volume of drawings entitled " The Billy Goat, and 
Other Comicalities " (Scribner). The plates are 
divided in sets, each of which tells a story with a 
catastrophic ending that is usually of a painful or 
humiliating nature to the victim. The type is 
familiar to readers of the comic weeklies. 

An age, like the present one, rather given to sneer- 
ing at friendship and other primitive human senti- 
ments as " obsolete," should find Mr. Hugh Black's 
pretty and modest book on " Friendship " (Revell) 
profitable reading. Mr. Black is a popular Scotch 
preacher ; but there is no twang of the conventicle 
in his style. He divides his subject under nine 
headings, such as " The Miracle of Friendship," 
" The Culture of Friendship," " The Fruits of Friend- 
ship," " The Choice of Friendship," and so forth. 
These sub-topics are treated in a limpid, virile, and 
stimulating way, that makes one rather envy Mr. 
Black's parishioners the fortunate congregation, 
by the way, of Free St. George's, Edinburgh. The 
volume is a very presentable little duodecimo, soundly 
made, and suitably decorated. The light-red border 
enclosing the text of each page has a pleasing effect, 
as has the binding of olive-green-and-gold ribbed 
cloth. 

An odd looking booklet bound apparently in un- 
bleached crash contains Mr. Kipling's popular bal- 
lad of " Mandalay," with drawings by Miss Blanche 
McManus. The drawings are printed in light red 
on tinted paper, and are nicely done. This u catchy " 
and not inartistic little production bids fair to score 
a success in its modest class this Christmas. (M. F. 
Mansfield & Co.) 

A rather pretty publication which will doubtless 
find admirers is the " Marie Corelli Birthday Book " 
(Lippincott), compiled by Mr. M. W. Davies and 
illustrated by Messrs. Ernest Prater and G. H. Ed- 
wards. The drawings, which depict Miss Corelli's 
heroines, are fairly successful, and the extracts 
from her writings are carefully chosen. The vol- 
ume is bound in bottle-green cloth, and the text is 
printed in light-green ink. 

The "Chinese Children's Calendar," published by 
Mr. R. H. Russell, is one of the most attractive of 
the season. It consists of four drawings, handsomely 
printed in colors, of Chinese children in costume, 
made from life by Miss Bertha Stuart. Mr. Russell 
also publishes the " Colonial Soldier Calendar," an 
effective design, printed in colors on heavy card- 
board, that should find especial favor among the 
children. 

Mr. William Doxey of San Francisco sends us the 
" Lark Almanac " for 1899 and a new edition of the 
popular " Purple Cow." Both of these attractive 
booklets are made up of pictures and verses orig- 
inally contributed by Mr. Gelett Burgess to the 
pages of that entertaining but short-lived little peri- 
odical, " The Lark." 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

IL 

Somewhat apart from the mass of books for boys is 
Mr. Edwin Pugh's "Tony Drum" (Holt). In the 
midst of the mediocrity and emptiness that are conjured 
up in the name of childhood, it is good to come upon a 
writer who has his hand on life. This story of the 
slums is the biography of the humpbacked sou of a 
wandering flute-player; yet, with such temptations to 
sentimentality, the author is quite as plucky as his 
little hero. There is no sniffling, no exaggeration of the 
inevitable pathos. A kind of rugged simplicity is the 
note of the book. Its quality is expressed at once to 
the eye in the remarkable illustrations by Mr. William 
Nicholson; for the author is as much of an artist as 
the picture-maker, and there is an extraordinary sym- 
pathy between the drawings and the text. The person- 
ality of Michael Drum is as sharply presented in the 
frontispiece as it is in the story itself, and the single 
brief appearance of Tony's grandfather in the text 
brings him before us as vividly as does Mr. Nicholson's 
drawing. Tony himself is a creation, a real boy; and 
they are very genuine emotions and imaginings and 
heartaches to which we are bluntly introduced. There 
is tenderness underneath the author's admirable reserve, 
his heavy and rugged outlines; and it makes the sensi- 
tive and imaginative little cripple vivid to one's fancy. 

From this to any other book in the group is a long 
descent. Mr. William O. Stoddard writes the conven- 
tional boy's story well in " Success against Odds " 
(Apple ton). Perhaps some boy will like the successful 
Steve better than the hapless Tony, but ten years later 
his choice will be reversed Mr. J. T. Trowbridge also 
knows how to please the average boy, and in " Two 
Biddicut Boys " (Century) his hero is a wonderful trick 
dog. He is the centre of the boyish pranks, and even 
takes an active part in them, to the endless delight of 
all boy lovers of dogs. Mr. Herbert Elliott Hamblen 
gives us two books this year, but neither one of them is 
as interesting to boys as the stories of the building of 
railroads which he collected under the title of " The 
General Manager's Story." " Tom Benton's Luck " 
(Macmillan) tells of many adventures on sea and land; 
but somehow they are not convincing. The wrecks are 
too theatrical, and Tom's experience in the tropics bears 
no evidence of reality. In spite of his manifold adven- 
tures, Tom is never quite alive, and one is consequently 
rather indifferent to his success even in the love affair, 
which seems hardly necessary in this kind of a book. 
" The Story of a Yankee Boy " (Scribner), by the same 
author, has more of life and movement, though the 
hero's experiences are much more commonplace. They 
are not very pretty, some of them, but they are not un- 
natural to a boy with a good dash of original sin in him. 

Colonel Henry Inman has a good subject in " The 
Ranch on the Oxhide " (Macmillan), but he uses it as 
a basis for hunting stories and battles with big game, 
rather than for the portrayal of ranch life. It is of the 
pioneer days in Kansas, however, that Colonel Inman 
writes, when wolves and panthers, buffaloes and Indians 
were more familiar to the ranchman than they are to-day. 
He tells about them with some dash and evident knowl- 
edge It is frontier life, also, which interests Mr. 

James Otis in " Dick in the Desert " (Crowell). He 
intimates that the story is a true one, and dedicates the 
book to " Dick," who certainly has the modesty and 
courage necessary to real heroes. His lonely journey 
across the Smoke Creek Desert in Nevada to procure 



466

[Dec. 16, 



help for his wounded father is well described. Mr. 
Otis's style is also good in "Joel Harford " (Crowell), 
where he finds his hero in one of the innumerable country 
boys who begin life in the city of New York. On the 
first day he is robbed of his small capital and thrown on 
the world. But he is plucky and industrious, and with 
the encouragement of two newsboy chums he makes 
a way and a place for himself. A still more ambitious 
young American, Mr. Harry Steele Morrison, writes his 
own biography in " A Yankee Boy's Success " (Stokes) ; 
and a very unlovely and unpleasant sort of boy he seems 
to be. He interviews the Queen on the cover, the Presi- 
dent in the frontispiece, and Mr. Chauncey Depew in 
the opening pages; and shows that combination of impu- 
dence and ' enterprise " which, when he gets older, ought 
to make him a great " find " for some " yellow journal." 
Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth's book of travel is quite 
different. " Lost in Nicaragua" (Wilde) continues the 
travels of the Frobishers, who last year wandered 
"Over the Andes," and relates especially the story 
of one of them who was lost in an ancient idol cave 
in his effort to capture a quetzel, the royal bird of the 
Aztecs. Many of the picturesque old legends and super- 
stitions are introduced, and some of the history and 
peculiarities of a country which promises to have a special 
interest for Americans. "Yule Logs" (Longmans) 
has the recommendation of being edited by Mr. G. A. 
Henty, and the Indian and tomahawk in the frontispiece 
will be enough, doubtless, to attract the average boy. 
The book is made up of a dozen stirring tales of adven- 
ture, by such well-known writers as Kirk Munroe, G. 
Manville Fenn, J. Bloundelle-Burton, and Mr. Henty 
himself. A book for boys of a serious and studious cast 
of mind is Mr. John Trowbridge's " Physical Science at 
Home" (Appleton), in which amusement and instruc- 
tion are combined in about the right proportions. 

To the writer of books for boys there seems to be no 
place where they may not travel, and even the forbid- 
ding Klondike has drawn out two stories. Mr. E. S. 
Ellis's "Klondike Nuggets" (Doubleday & McClnre 
Co.) is ornamented with many pictures by Mr. Orson 
Lowell, which, however, are badly printed. The story 
is an entertaining and well- written one, dealing with the 
experiences of two adventurous boys in search of gold. 
They have good luck and bad, but succeed overwhelm- 
ingly at the end. They do it a bit too easily, perhaps, 
for the good of boys at home who read the story. Less 
rather than more than this can be said for Dr. Gordon 
Stables's " Off to Klondyke " (Crowell), dealing with sim- 
ilar material. From this new and excited civilization, 
The Lost City " (Estes), by Mr. Joseph E. Badger, Jr., 
carries us back to an old and calmer one. But we pass 
through some novel experiences to reach it. Carried in 
a flying machine into the heart of a tornado, we are 
whirled with it through space to come down finally upon 
the lost city of the Aztecs. An inhabited city it is, too, 
which makes the accounts of it an entertaining tissue 
of impossibilities Not less extraordinary is Mr. Charles 
Frederick Holder's discovery of a new field for youthful 
investigation in " The Treasure Divers " (DoddV He 
equips a boat, like the Holland submarine torpedo boat, 
for the exploration of the depths of the sea. His picture 
of life in this larger world is interesting, and he asserts 
that, with the exception of the inevitable sea-serpent, the 
weird and terrible animals he shows us are scientifically 
accurate. It is a kind of natural history unusual to boys' 
books. Another venture into the unknown is Mr. Skel- 
ton Kuppard's " Uncharted Island " (Nelson). The book 



is so filled with action, and the island so loaded with treas- 
ure, that few boys will complain at any apparent lack of 
reality in the narrative. The special charm of F. 
Anstey's book is effectually concealed under the title, 
" Paleface and Redskin, and Other Stories for Boys 
and Girls" (Appleton). Instead of the blood-and- 
thunder article that we expect, we find a clever and 
laughable little story of mimic warriors and the dis- 
comfiture of their boastful general. The real boy and 
girl are present in all of the stories, and they talk as 
they do in life. And the author's irony is launched 
against priggishness and affectation, and kindred faults, 
of which young people are sometimes rather proud. 
The stories are funny to the old as well as to the young, 
and they have a way of enforcing wholesome lessons 
without seeming to do so. Mr. Gordon Browne's pic- 
tures rise to the cleverness of the text. 

Mr. Rupert Hughes has written a new kind of boys' 
book in " The Lakerim Athletic Club " (Century). He 
tells how twelve sturdy boys learn to play football ; and 
then, as that game does not last all the year, he teaches 
them skating, bicycle polo, golf, and many another sport. 
But the best of it is that the boys are very much alive 
and are individualized with a good deal of skill. Tug 
and Bobbles and Sawed-off would appeal to any boy 
who has a wholesome love of athletics. For these also 
is "The Boys of Fairport" (Scribner), written by Mr. 
Noah Brooks. It was originally published as "The 
Fairport Nine," but as several new chapters, dealing with 
adventures outside the baseball field, were introduced, 
the name was changed In "The Boy Mineral Col- 
lectors" (Lippinoott), Mr. Jay G. Kelley, M.E., invites 
the attention to a new, profitable, and absorbing source 
of amusement. Under the thin guise of a story, the 
book contains much useful information about the nature 
of minerals. Its value is increased by a good index. 
Miss Effie W. Merriman's "Sir Jefferson Nobody" 
(McClurg) is guiltless of any intention to instruct. It 
is a prettily written story about a young fellow who 
does many generous things and finds that in the long 

run they pay better than selfishness " Chilhowee 

Boys in Harness " (Crowell), by Miss Sarah E. Mor- 
rison, is the last in the Chilhowee series, and follows 
the fortunes of the youngest son of Parson Craig in the 

middle of the century " Chums at Last" (Nelson), 

by Mr. A. Forsyth Grant, is a story of English school 
life, and a jolly good story it is, too. There is a great 
deal of human nature in this crowd of boys, and their 
simple quarrels and difficulties are much more interest- 
ing than if they were prowling in the wilds of Asia or 
Australia. They are but simple adventures, also, in 
" The Widow O'Callaghan's Boys " (McClurg), by Miss 
Gulielma Zollinger, but they are pleasant to read of. 
The seven boys, whom the widow trains to be good and 
useful men, are as plucky as she; and they have a good 
bit of the Irish loyalty as well as of the Irish brogue. 
The pictures, by Miss S. Crosby, are good. Miss Julia 
Magruder takes a rather sentimental view of life in 
" Labor of Love " (Lothrop), but she serves it up pret- 
tily " The Young Supercargo " (Wilde), by Mr. 

William Drysdale, is a new volume in the " Brain and 
Brawn Series," and takes its hero on many long voy- 
ages In " Six Young Hunters " (Lee & Shepard), Mr. 

W. Gordon Parker relates the adventures of the Grey- 
hound Club with game and outlaws in Indian Territory. 
"The Young Bank Messenger" (Coates), by Mr. 
Horatio Alger, Jr., is also invaded by outlaws, and very 
stilted and impossible persons they prove to be. Mr.

Kirk Munroe has a new and exciting subject in " The 
Copper Princess " (Harper). His hero leaves college 
to find that his fortune has disappeared with the ex- 
ception of an interest in a Lake Superior mine. Though 
the mine is said to be worthless, he determines to find 
out the facts for himself, and he has an active time of 
it in learning the business and retrieving his fortune. 
Between the miners and the smugglers there is plenty 
of fighting, but it all makes for success in the end. The 
success is almost too complete, indeed, to be real. The 
cover of the book is capital, and there are good illus- 
trations by Mr. W. A. Rogers Mrs. Gertrude Atherton 
is nothing if not picturesque in her story of " The Valiant 
Runaways" (Dodd). The scene of action is early Cal- 
ifornia, and Roldan Castanada is the hero. His flight 
to escape the conscription is the motive of the plot, but 
he proves, pluckily enough, that he was not afraid of 
fighting. His valiant deeds are rather theatrical, and 
they do not quite convince the reader, as they seem to 
have convinced Mrs. Atherton, that he was born to be 
a leader of men. In spite of some forced and twisted 
English, there is much life and color in the book. 
Will Allen Dromgoole, who is even more prolific this 
year than Mr. Henty, has written three more books 
for boys. One is a tale of " A Moonshiner's Son " 
(Penn Publishing Co.) who, in spite of fate, is a good 
boy, almost preternaturally good. But his story is well 
told, and contains the figure of a kind old country store- 
keeper, which is the best thing in it. If one can recover 
from the shock produced by the cover, with its impossible 
boys against an impossible landscape, of " Three Little 
Crackers from Down in Dixie " (Page), by the same 
author, an entertaining story of the Florida wilderness 
will be found. The adventures of these boy pioneers 
are chiefly with alligators and wild-cats and such unde- 
sirable companions. In " The Fortunes of the Fellow " 
(Page), Will Allen Dromgoole tells the story of a waif 
who finds a father, and whose gradual transformation 
under the loving care of the old blacksmith is pleasant 
to read about. The author tries a bit too obviously to 
exert a moral influence, but he has a sense of character 
which makes up for it Mr. James Barnes has written 
a life of Oliver Hazard Perry under the title of " The 
Hero of Erie " (Apple ton). It is more exciting than 
any novel and better worth reading. Mr. Barnes de- 
scribes the battle of Lake Erie in a way to make it 
impossible to forget. The pictures are capital, some of 
them being taken from old engravings. Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer is much more sensational and less true in 
"A Young Volunteer in Cuba" (Lee & Shepard). It 
is up to date, but that is about the best that may be 
said of it. 

Several tempting dishes are placed before the very 
little boys this year. " Little Mr. Van Vere of China " 
(Estes), by Mrs. Harriet A. Cheever, is pleasant to the 
taste, with its pretty illustrations by Miss Etheldred B. 
Barry. It is the story of a little fellow who becomes 
a stowaway in the ship of a jolly old captain. The boy 
is a bit too good, perhaps, and his lot is made unnaturally 

smooth ; yet the story is rather pretty Lucas Malet 

has woven a charming little story about the experience 
of " Little Peter " and his cat. They are French, both 
of them, and very wise and simple ; and their biography 
is written with so much grace and delicacy that none 

of us are too old to enjoy it (Crowell) Will Allen 

Dromgoole gives us two attractive little books. " Hero- 
Chums " (Estes) shows the friendship between an old 
man and a very little chap, and ends with the great sac- 



rifice made by the one for the other. " A Boy's Battle " 
(Estes) has an older fellow for its hero; the story centres 
in his struggle with his conscience, which ends in highly 
melodramatic fashion with the victory of conscience and 
the boy's confession in open court. Mr. Homer Greene's 
story of the Pennsylvania coal - miners, " The Blind 
Brother" (Crowell), which won the "Youth's Com- 
panion " large prize in 1886, is brought out in a new 

edition There is a new edition also of Hawthorne's 

"Grandfather's Chair" (Crowell), which is perennially 
interesting And the list closes with Mrs. C. F. Eraser's 
" Master Sunshine " (Crowell), which is written with the 
best intentions in the world, made a bit too manifest. 

To the girls, providence has been generous in books 
this year, but generous in number rather than in quality. 
The rule still holds that it is better for a girl to read her 
brother's books than her own. Even at the worst, his have 
a certain virility which is more wholesome than the flab- 
biness so common in hers. It is only the exceptional 
writer who is able to avoid sentimentality in writing for 
girls. Some authors handle it well, and thus mitigate 
the offense; but in one form or another, in a perverted 
view of life if not in actual love-making, it will slip in. 
There is something of it even in Mrs. Ewing's " Daddy 
Darwin's Dovecote " (Estes), though here there are 
touches of beauty and of real life. But Mrs. Ewing 
found her place years ago, and there are many to wel- 
come this new edition, with its pretty drawings by Miss 
Etheldred B. Barry. Mrs. Laura E. Richards was 
unfortunate enough to do a fine thing in " Captain 
January," which makes each successor a disappointment. 
" Margaret Montf ort " (Estes) is a readable story about 
the efforts of one of the " Three Margarets " to keep 
house for her uncle. The motive is rather thin even 
for a girl's book, and the aggressive cousin who inter- 
feres is a bit too aggressive to be natural. A delight- 
ful cover by Mr. George Wharton Edwards attracts one 
at once to " A Little Colonial Dame " (Stokes), by Miss 
Agnes Carr Sage. And its quaintness is carried through 
the story. It is more Dutch than American, this tale 
of old Manhattan, and it suggests rather charmingly the 
transformation of the one into the other. Some of the 
climaxes are highly melodramatic, and the Dutch dialect 
and the quaint old English are insisted upon rather 
strongly. Yet the picture is novel and interesting, 
love-making and all. The illustrations, by Miss Mabel 
Humphrey, are pretty but characterless In " A Little 
New England Maid" (Lothrop), Mrs. Kate Tannatt 
Woods tries to carry one back to another section of the 
colonies. But she is too obviously of the present in deal- 
ing with the past; one is too conscious of the author to 
believe in her story. And there is a prodigious deal 
about love and marriage, which is not interesting enough 
to be justifiable Mrs. Amanda M. Douglas carries one 
down to a somewhat later date in " A Little Girl in Old 
Boston " (Dodd) . Her story, which ends with the inevit- 
able marriage, is written for older girls with sweet sim- 
plicity. Doris is an attractive little woman, who is also 
good and wholesome. It is the kind of book that many 
girls will like, though it is very far from being a work 
of art. Mrs. Douglas's popularity is attested by the 
appearance of the seventh volume in her " Sherburne 
Series" (Dodd). "Sherburne Girls "is a good book 
of its kind. Plenty of things happen, and the girls make 
the proper sacrifices and do good to their neighbors; yet 
the story is never very close to the actual and real, and 
a girl who is old enough to read it could spend the time 
much more profitably and happily with Thackeray or

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Scott Under the title of Hester Stanley'* Friends " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.), Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford 
has published a collection of short stories about girls. 
They are simply and prettily written, without pretension 
or gush. And if the goodness of some of these children 
is almost superhuman, still Mrs. Spofford has a way of 
making it seem natural. The moral effect of the book 
is all that the most careful mother could desire; which 

makes it a pity that the pictures are so bad They are 

not bad in "Katrina" (Wilde), for Mrs. Alice Barber 
Stephens knows how to draw. The story is written by 
Miss Ellen Douglas Deland, and is of much the same 
calibre as Mrs. Spofford's work. The style is excel- 
lent, and the story interesting without sentimentality. 
Without being phenomenal, Katrina is attractive, and 
her life in town and country is exciting enough and yet 
simple and natural. This is one of the best of the books 
for girls Miss Evelyn Raymond, in " Among the Lin- 
dens" (Little, Brown, & Co.), tells the story of a little 
girl who in some mysterious way saves an old man from 
being run over in the streets of New York. The old 
gentleman turns out to be eccentric, and takes it upon 
himself to act as her special providence. The first result 
is an enormous basket of chrysanthemums, the price of 
which the author is considerate enough to tell us. And 
the other results may be imagined, though not the mer- 
riment which the author succeeds in putting into her 
narrative. In " The American Girls' Handy Book " 
(Scribner) the Misses Lina and Adelia Beard have 
sought to do for girls what has been so successfully 
done for boys by their brother, Mr. Dan Beard, in his 
well-known "American Boys' Handy Book." The 
present work is carried out on the same general lines, 
and provides an interesting collection of games and 
amusements. It is well-illustrated, and should prove 
fully as popular as its predecessor. 

Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney continues her popular 
series with a timely book called " Witch Winnie in 
Spain" (Dodd). It is illustrated with reproductions 
of great paintings by Velasquez, Fortuny, and Rico, 
which alone are something of an education. The text 
includes much instruction about great men and great 
deeds in its description of the rambling tour of these 
young girls through a beautiful country. It is written 
in a varied and entertaining way, though without origi- 
nality It is even a longer journey that is taken by two 
little girls in " The Musical Journey of Dorothy and 
Delia" (Crowell), by Mr. Bradley Gilman. They are 
carried far off into Music- Land, where the treble clef 
turns into an old woman, and the bass clef into an old 
man with a twinkle in his eye, and the notes come to 
life and dance about in the merriest way. Under a gay 
and fanciful disguise, the book contains a good deal of 
practical instruction for beginners in music; and it might 
give them a new imaginative interest in the necessary 
drudgery. The book has some charmingly clever pic- 
tures by Mr. F. G. Attwood. In quite a different way, 
there is character also in the illustrations by Miss Ellen 
B. Thompson for" Twixt Yon and Me " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.). Miss Grace Le Baron writes the stories, which 
are pretty but rather commonplace, and the poems, 
which have less of the one quality and more of the 
other. There are some graceful decorations by Miss 
Katharine Pyle A new edition of Mrs. Mary Mapes 
Dodge's "Irvington Stories" (Wm. L. Allison Co.) 
will be welcomed by all those children, now grown gray 
and dignified, who loved these stories of old, especially 
with the original illustrations by F. O. C. Darley. Other 



stories have been added, but Captain George, "Old 
Pop," and Po-no-kah are still here, and Mrs. Dodge 

knows how to make them delightful The moral of 

11 A Little Turning Aside" (Jacobs), by Miss Barbara 
Yechton, is a trifle obscure, but in life also the moral 
is not always easy to see. Duty is a large word, and 
sometimes it does not lie in the most obvious direction. 
According to Ibsen, the development of the individual 
has the first claim, and there are others also who would 
justify Hetty's desertion of her aunt in this little book 
to go to New York and study art. Her success, inter- 
rupted by her sudden blindness and the resulting enrich- 
ing of her character, makes quite an absorbing story. 
It is well written, and the persons of the play have 
some individuality and are faultily human. The cover 
of the book in white and reds, is capital. 

A German story is a rather interesting interlude, it 
is so different in character, so genuinely outspoken, and 
so frankly sentimental. " An Obstinate Maid " (Jacobs) 
is translated from the twenty-first edition of the novel 
by Emma von Rhoden, by Miss Mary E. Ireland. And 
it is a rather interesting story of the transformation of 
an untamed girl who is sent to boarding-school. The 
story is a little too rapid, perhaps, and too complete, 
and it winds up in the inevitable love-affairs; but the 
girls are given a few wholesome faults as a concession 
to the frailty of humanity. Miss Julie M. Lippmann's 
" Dorothy Day " (Penn Publishing Co.) is also a story 
of school pranks and home sacrifices. It is harmless 
enough and pretty enough, too, in spite of the highly 
sensational picture of the rescue of a young girl from 
the back of an astonishing runaway horse. The episode 
is quite as impossible in the text as in Miss Waugh's 
drawing, but the rest of the story is not so bad. It is 
refreshing to find a really charming little book about 
college life, in " Three Freshmen " (McClurg), by Miss 
Jessie Anderson Chase. One of the three freshmen is 
from Boston, another from Virginia, and the third from 
Chicago; so there is variety enough to give interest to 
their meeting at Smith College. The writer differentiates 
the characters admirably, and there is a delightful spark- 
ling gayety in her treatment of them. It is one of the 
most breezy and wholesome of this year's books for 
girls. The sub-title of Miss Anna Chapin Ray's 
" Teddy, Her Book, a Story of Sweet Sixteen " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) is rather prejudicial, but the story is not 
so bad as one might expect. Most of the sentimentality 
is confined to the last chapters, and there is a good deal 
of truth in the descriptions of Teddy's trials and ambi- 
tions. The talk of the children is lively and natural, 
but the book is handicapped with ridiculous pictures. 
So many of the pictures which appear in these books 
for the young would be more attractive if they were 
invisible. " Everyday Honor " (whatever that may 
mean) is another incipient novel, or another novel for 
incipient intellects. It is very diffuse and very talky, 
but if one does n't mind that, it is pleasant enough 

(Jacobs) Miss Mary F. Leonard's " The Story of the 

Big Front Door " (Crowell) is much more wholesome. 
They are simple and harmless pranks that these children 
play, and the author describes them with sympathetic 
vivacity. Miss Jessie E. Wright's " Odd Little Lass " 
(Penn Publishing Co.) is a perverse and naughty child, 
but a plucky and clever one nevertheless. Her experi- 
ence in a " Home," followed by life with several people 
who wish to adopt her, is the basis of the book. " As 
in a Mirror " (Lothrop) is another of the " Pansy books," 
by Mrs. G. R. Alden. But the characters grow up and 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



469 



become hopelessly stilted and sentimental. " Katie, a 
Daughter of the King " (Jacobs), by Miss Mary A. 
Gilmore, is too obviously written for Sunday-schools. 
In spite of its pretty cover, there are not many of us 
who can endure such insistent and relentless virtue. 
Miss Martha Finley continues the " Elsie Books " 
(Dodd) with " Elsie on the Hudson," and continues also 
the instruction which is mixed up with that young wo- 
man's experiences. " Pauline Wyman " (Lee & Shep- 
ard) is by another writer who is familiar to the rising 
generation, Miss Sophie May. Her heroine is a New 
England girl, whose character is developed through 
many trials, none of them so great, however, as the 
cover of this book. 

There are several books, also, about very little girls, 
and none is more attractive than " The Princess and 
Joe Potter" (Estes), with its clever illustrations by 
Miss Violet Oakley. Mr. James Otis has written a 
charming little story about this Princess of three, who 
was lost, and the little fruit-vender, who found her and 
cared for her through adversity. The boys of the story 
are lively, spirited, and big-hearted, and Mr. Otis likes 
and understands them. And it is easy to see why Joe 

Potter loved the Princess The hero of " Denise and 

Ned Toodles " (Century) , by Miss Gabrielle E. Jackson, 
is a pony ; but he is much more intelligent than most 
heroes. His little mistress teaches him many things, 
but he teaches her more, and we can learn all about 
them both in this lively narrative. " Marjory and her 
Neighbors " (Lothrop), described by Miss Louise E. 
Catlin, are little people, but they have very good times 
in the country town they live in. Yet their story is 
rather long and quiet for such restless mites. " Dear 
Little Marchioness " (Crowell) has an introduction by 
Bishop Gailor, who describes it as the story of a child's 
faith and love. The scene is laid in the South, and an 
old negro is a prominent figure. A charming little 
autobiography of a canary-bird is concealed under the 
title of " The Strange Adventures of Billy Trill " (Estes), 
by Mrs. Harriet A. Cheever, and a very blithe and 

merry little bird he proves to be It is a bit of a kitten 

who is the centre of Miss Blanchard's " Kittyboy's 
Christmas " (Jacobs) ; but even this book for wee girls 
winds up with a love-affair. " The Story of Little Jane 
and Me " (Houghton), by M. E., has the advantage of 
a quaint and lovely cover. And it has the further ad- 
vantage of being gracefully written, with much tender- 
ness and charm, but without a trace of sentimentality. 
It is full of a true childish naivete, which is rarely found 
in books In "Rare Old Chums" (Estes), Will Allen 
Dromgoole has written the story of the friendship be- 
tween a little girl and an old man " Ruth and her 

Grandfadder " (A. S. Barnes & Co.) has much the same 
theme. The verses it begins with are bad, but the story 
is better, and it is decorated prettily by Mr. Edward B. 
Edwards. 

The ingenuity which goes into the making of picture- 
books has not yet been exhausted, and some of the later 
ones of the season are exceedingly clever. The charm 
of its cover and colored pictures permit " Alice in Won- 
derland, A Play " (Dodd) to be classed among them. 
Mrs. Emily Prime Delafield has arranged Lewis Car- 
roll's inimitable stories into a drama, which is delightful 
to read and doubtless would be still more delightful in 
the performance. It was presented originally at the 
Waldorf Hotel in New York for the benefit of the 
Society of Decorative Art, and made a success great 
enough to warrant this publication. The adaptation has 



been so well done that none of the flavor of the original 
is lost. It would be hard to find a more amusing play 
for children to act than this. " The New Noah's Ark " 
(John Lane), by Mr. J. J. Bell, has the advantage of 
a novel and highly decorative cover. It is a very ridicu- 
lous gallery of animals, somewhat after the manner of 
Edward Lear, but without his whimsical ingenuity. The 
verses are funny, however, and the pictures, in bright 
yellows and purples and reds, are still funnier. Some 
of the animals are imaginary, and the others are even 
more so. The elephant and the cow are the cleverest 
of these creations, but the effort to be funny is a bit too 
evident. Mr. Oliver P. Tunk does the same kind of 
thing in " An Awful Alphabet " (Russell), showing his 
animals also " as they ought to be." But these, too, are 
rather too absurd and impossible. More ingenuity is used 
in their construction than in Mr. Bell's drawings, but for 
the real thing in this kind of work one must go back to 

Edward Lear The pictures by Mr. Frank Ver Beck 

in " The Arkansaw Bear " (Russell), have much more 
genuine humor, partly because they have some relation 
to reality. The character in them is irresistible, and one 
makes friends at once with " Bosephus and the Fiddle 
and the Old Black Bear." It is a musical trio, and they 
go singing through the book until they make us who 
read about them sing too. The verses they improvise 
are very taking and appropriate to all occasions. The 
story is a clever one, written with a great deal of spirit. 
There is no dearth of animals this year, and " Sybil's 
Garden of Pleasant Beasts" (Russell), by Sybil and 
Katharine Corbet, is a diverting addition for little 
people. It is pure nonsense, but of an unexpected and 
ingenious sort. Imaginative little brains would love its 
whimsicalities. The beasts are even pleasanter in the 
pictures than in the story. It is quite a different kind 
of beast that Mr. E. W. Kemble celebrates in " A Coon 
Alphabet " (Russell). Exaggerated as they are, his 
darkies are certainly funny, and he has a keen enough 
sense of the ludicrous to place them in very ridiculous 
situations. But in this book his humor is in its most 
obvious and least subtle stage. " The Sambo Book " 
(Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins Co.), by Mr. Isaac 
Coale, Jr., deals with a member of the same race. With 
some idea of symbolism, probably, it is printed upon 
gray paper, and the clever drawings by Miss Katharine 
Gassaway gain much from the juxtaposition of black 
and gray. The stories are pretty, naive, simple little 

tales about the unsophisticated Sambo One of the 

most attractive of the picture books is " New Mother 
Goose Pictures" (Russell), drawn by Mr. Chester 
Loomis. The familiar old verses are printed, and the 
pictures are very decorative and charming arrangements 
in black and white. They are not as imaginative as Mr. 
Maxfield's Parrish's of last year, but they have character, 
and they are artistic in the decorative use of flat tones. 
We learn how Simple Simon went a' fishing, and how 
Tom the Piper's Son stole a pig, with special delight. 
Miss Emilie Poulsson's " Child Stories and Rhymes " 
(Lothrop) is illustrated in a much more commonplace 
way by Mr. L. J. Bridgman. The verses are more 
commonplace, too, and even if they are " welcomed with 
delight by mothers and kindergartners," we fancy that 
the children themselves will prefer good old Mother 
Goose. And they would be wiser than some of their 
parents think. " Stories True and Fancies New " 
(Estes), by Mrs. Mary Whitney Morrison, is a book full 
of verses which also are intended chiefly for the kinder- 
garten. They are well illustrated by Mr. L. J. Bridgman.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



A few fairy books most be added to the list in our 
last number, and they are always welcome and nearly 
always healthful. Mr. Charles Robinson, who did such 
lovely things with Eugene Field's " Lullaby Land " last 
year, has decorated " King Long-Beard, or Annals of 
the Golden Dreamland " (Lane), by Mr. Harrington 
Macgregor. The work is admirably done, and preju- 
dices one at once in favor of the stories, which turn out 
to be delicate and quaint enough to deserve their setting. 

Mr. John Habberton, who made himself famous with 
" Helen's Babies," prints a clever book this year, called 
" With the Dream-Maker " (Jacobs). His little hero 
has a strange experience in discovering the country 
where dreams come from. He becomes the confidant 
of the dream-maker, and learns all of his secrets, to our 
intense delight. It is an amusing and spirited little tale, 
and the moral is skilfully concealed. The fairies and 
princesses and ogres are merely incidental to a pretty 
story of a little American girl in France, in " The Gate 
of the Giant Scissors " (Page). Mrs. Annie Fellows 
Johnston is the author, and it is a pleasant little glimpse 
of French customs that she gives us. There are more 
fairies and dwarfs and things in " The Green Toby Jug " 
(Nelson), by Mrs. Edwin Hohler, but it is a princess of 
flesh and blood who rules the book. The stories are 
written for little children in a rather taking manner. 
Much less wholesome food than this is found in Miss 
Martha Baker Dunn's " The Sleeping Beauty, a Modern 
Version " (Page). It is a sadly sentimental variation 
of the picturesque old tale, much too old for children and 

much too young for their elders Mr. C. M. Dnppa's 

" Stories from Lowly Life " (Macmillan) have a certain 
interest for everybody. We have all had some kind 
of a pet in childhood, and can find bis counterpart 
in one or another of these stories of animals. There 
is no affectation or exaggeration in them, and they do not 
relate extraordinary adventures. They are simple and 
pleasant accounts of the doings of dogs and ponies, birds 
and mice, written by one who loves them. Miss Martha 
Finley's " Twiddledetwit " (Dodd) belongs among the 
fairy tales more strictly than do the two books last men- 
tioned. The very name is enough to evoke fairies and 
witches even to the most sedate; and the little children 
for whom this tale was written will be glad to find them 

good and generous They are not quite so faultless in 

Miss Florence Paillou's " Captain Darning Needle, and 
Other Folks" (Buffalo: Charles Wells Moulton), but 
then the little girls and boys who play with them have, 
fortunately, a few faults of their own. So they make 
a very entertaining crowd, especially the needles and pins 
who come to life to reprove and fascinate little Jennie. 

Such old familiar friends as " Hop o' my Thumb," 
11 Cinderella," and " Puss in Boots," edited and re- written 
by the author of " John Halifax, Gentleman," are printed 
in " The Fairy Book " (Crowell). It is pleasant to meet 
these old favorites in any guise, and the liberties Mrs. 
Craig has taken with them are for the most part harm- 
less ones. It is a very charming sort of fairy story 
that Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth has translated from the 
Italian in " Pinocchio's Adventures in Wonderland " 
(Boston: Jordan, Marsh, & Co.). The little wooden 
puppet comes to life in the most natural way, and de- 
velopes attractively perverse and naughty qualities. He 
is so spirited a little fellow that he interests one at once, 
and be has individuality enough to hold one's interest. 
It is a sunny little book. 

Fairies are good food for the imagination, but such 
a book as " Heroes of Chivalry and Romance" (Mac- 



millan), by the Rev. A. J. Church, M.A., is still 
better. This is of the right sort. Nothing more 
wholesome and stimulating could be found for boys 
and girls than these majestic old myths ; they are so 
closely interwoven with the arts, and are the foundations 
of so much that is beautiful in literature and music and 
painting, that one must be familiar with them. Heard 
in childhood in the simple and vivid way in which Mr. 
Church tells them, they are not easily forgotten. They 
grow to be real ; we live with them, they have an 
actuality more precious to us than that of the common- 
place people who walk the streets. And later this 
familiarity helps us to be appreciative of many things 
which might otherwise remain dark ; for the stories of 
Beowulf, of the Knights of the Round Table, of Sieg- 
fried and the treasure of the Nibelungs, are of the very 
essence of poetry and romance. Mr. George Morrow's 
pictures in color are a fitting accompaniment to the 
tales. Mr. William H. Babcock has founded a romance 
upon the life of King Arthur in " Cian of the Chariots " 
(Lothrop). It is a fine rich story, and the style is pic- 
turesque. There is hardly less romance in some events 
of our own time as described in " A Gunner Aboard 
the Yankee" (Doubleday & McClure Co.). It is edited 
by Mr. H. H. Lewis from the diary of " Number Five 
of the After Port Gun," and Admiral Sampson has 
honored it with an introduction. Number Five is one 
of the New York Naval Reserves, and he not only knows 
how to fight but he knows how to write a lively and 
entertaining narrative. Mr. William O. Stoddard also 
writes of the Spanish war in " The First Cruiser Out " 
(Stone), a vigorous tale in which some Cuban women 
act an important part. " Visitors at Grampus Island " 
and "The Tale of an Oar" are printed in the same 
book, and Mr. Stoddard's name is a guarantee of good 

quality A life of " Fridtjof Nansen " (Heath) makes 

a novel book for boys, and a very wholesome and stimu- 
lating one. It is written by Mr. Jacob B. Bull and 
translated by the Rev. Mordaunt R. Barnard. The 
annual bound volume of " Harper's Round Table " is 
the first to appear since that popular periodical was 
changed from a weekly to a monthly publication, and in 
consequence the present volume is considerably less 
bulky than its predecessors. What is lost in size, how- 
ever, is more than made up in interest and value of the 
contents. The three leading serials are by Mr. H. B. 
Marriott Watson, Mr. Albert Lee, and Mr. Kirk Munroe. 
In addition to these, there are innumerable short stories, 
and articles on travel, history, and sport, all abund- 
antly illustrated. 

The books that remain must be dismissed with a word, 
as space is exhausted, even if the enterprise of publishers 
is not. The historical stories are " Under the Rattle- 
snake Flag " (Estes), by Mr. F. H. Costello; " The Boys 
with Old Hickory " (Lee & Shepard), by Mr. Everett 
T. Tomlinson ; " An Island Heroine, the Story of a 
Daughter of the Revolution" (Lothrop), by Miss Mary 
Breck Sleight ; and two lives of Christ which might be 
desirable on a desert island where no Bible could be 
procured: "The Prince of Peace" (Lothrop), by Mrs. 
Isabella M. Alden, who is better known as " Pansy," 
and "A Life of Christ for the Young" (Jacobs), by 
Mr. George Ludington Weed. There is also a book by 
the late Harold Frederic which deserves more than a 
word. "The Deserter and Other Stories" (Lothrop) 
contains two tales of the Civil War and two of the 
English War of the Roses, and there is nothing senti- 
mental or forced or unnatural about them. The heroism

in them is real and the characters are alive. And surely 
one need not go outside of probability to find romance. 
Of the other books two are especially for girls : 
"Cis Martin" (Curts & Jennings), by Miss Louise R. 
Baker, and "Laura's Holidays" (Lothrop), by Mrs. 
Henrietta R. Eliot. Four are for boys, being " A Puz- 
zling Pair" (Fleming H. Revell Co.), by Miss Amy 
Le Feuvre, with pretty marginal illustrations by Miss 
Eveline Lance; " Cristie, the King's Servant " (Fleming 
H. Revell Co.) by Mrs. O. H.Walton; "Reuben's Hin- 
drances " (Lothrop), by " Pansy " (Mrs. G. R. Alden) ; 
and " Two Little Runaways " (Longmans), by Mr. 
James Buckland. The last named story is almost as 
clever and amusing as its pictures by Mr. Cecil Aldin, 
which is saying a great deal. There are also two books 
for boys and girls alike: "Bilberry Boys and Girls" 
(Lothrop), by Miss Sophie Swett; and the adventures 
of "Buz-Buz," the fly (Lothrop), by Mr. Charles Stuart 
Pratt, with illustrations by Mr. L. J. Bridgman.

I must ask you to give me a little more space this time 
than usual, for the purpose of considering some of the 
points raised by Sir Walter Besant, in his letter in 
THE DIAL of Nov. 16, " traversing certain statements 
and opinions " contained in a letter by me in an earlier 
issue. This " traversing " of my statements and opinions 
consists, in Sir Walter's " Notes," in opposing to them 
his own opinions. Let me take his first two paragraphs: 

(/.) As to copyright. In my letter I stated certain 
facts with reference to the Committee of the House of 
Lords. Sir Walter Besant's criticism takes the form 
of belittling the facts and making statements which he 
does not and cannot prove, namely, that " the Com- 
mittee of the House of Lords was appointed in order to 
seem to do something." 

(//.) As to a new Copyright Bill. I am quite aware 
that " nothing is known of the intentions of the Govern- 
ment," and I did not say anything which revealed its inten- 
tions. What Sir Walter goes on to say is merely to supply 
considerations which had long ago been considered. 

So far on a subject that has as yet to be settled. Now 
let me take the points raised on other matters upon which 
the distinguished gentleman speaks as one with authority. 

I. Sir Walter Besant considers as contrary to fact my 
statement that " the magazine has almost ousted from 
the attention of the reading public all books other than 
those of the first importance " ; and he very ingeniously 
reads me as if by a magazine I meant the " Nineteenth 
Century," " Quarterly," " Temple Bar," and the rest of 
those so-called " high class monthlies." He states that 
" Harmsworth and Pearson and Newnes have discovered 
the new mass of readers created by the School Boards " ; 
that my statement is " ridiculous "; and that " those who 
buy these magazines have never bought books." 

Of course, Sir Walter Besant cannot support one of 
these assertions they are simply expressions of opinion, 
and of opinion by one who has never been actively en- 
gaged either as a general publisher or bookseller. Now 
I, on the contrary, speak from experience. " Readers 
created by the School Boards " lived long before Newnes 
or Pearson or Harmsworth existed. What did they 
read prior to the establishing of these firms ? Perhaps 
Besant and Rice's novels. Do they read them now ? 



The new readers are as " amused " and as " excited " by 
the six-penny and three-penny magazines as were the 
old ones by " The Golden Butterfly" and " Ready Money 
Mortiboy." " More books are published now than were 
ever known before " because there are more clever 
writers than there ever were before. " Libraries are 
springing up all over the country " because the rate- 
payers prefer to buy books at a farthing in the pound 
tax rather than pay whole pounds to purchase them for 
themselves; and, as Sir Walter Besant says, "these 
libraries are crowded with readers of books " a fact 
which booksellers know to their sorrow. How Sir Walter 
can say that " those who buy these magazines have 
never bought books " is beyond my comprehension. 
Has he interviewed every one of the hundreds of thous- 
ands of readers of the " Strand," " Pearson's," " Harms- 
worth's," and " The Royal " magazines, and obtained 
from each the exact information thus boldly asserted ? 

II. I still think that the publishing of the future 
will be in the hands of a few large syndicates, in spite 
of the new publishers which have started up by the 
dozen in the last few years; and Sir Walter's paragraph 
" traversing " this opinion of mine contains nothing 
which in any way touches it. 

I may say that three-fourths of the publishers cited 
by Sir Walter " started up " before the sixpenny and 
threepenny magazines were in existence. As an example 
of Sir Walter's inaccuracy of statement, I wish to point 
out that Rivington did not " start afresh the next day 
after Longmans absorbed Rivington," but many years 
after, and that Percival is not a house distinct from 
Rivington. 

III. As to the three-volume novel, I admit Sir Walter 
speaks with some authority; for he once published his 
own novels. I do not mean by this that his name ap- 
peared on the title-pages as publisher and author; but 
I mean that he tried the experiment, when in literary 
partnership with Mr. James Rice, of obtaining a pub- 
lisher who would receive the printed sheets and sell 
them on commission. How far the experiment suc- 
ceeded can best be judged from subsequent events. Bnt 
this is neither here nor there. Let me trace the effect 
of publishing a three-volume novel on the old lines in 
comparison with the method now pursued ; and before I 
proceed further let me just point out that Sir Walter 
always talks of the " popular author " and draws his 
conclusions of profits and sales from those made by the 
" great many thousand copies " which sell of a novel by 
a popular author. Seemingly, he quite forgets about 
the many authors who cannot be called " popular," but 
who contribute more than do the others to make good 
Sir Walter's own statement that " more books are pub- 
lished now than were ever known before." 

The publisher who issued a three-volume novel was 
pretty sure of sales to the libraries sufficient to recoup 
him for his outlay in the manufacture ; for royalties ad- 
vanced to the author; and for a profit to go to himself. 
If he issued twenty or thirty such novels a year, he had 
an income. Of a very popular work, as Sir Walter points 
out, twelve hundred to eighteen hundred and even two 
thousand copies might have been sold. All the more 
profit, then, for the author and the publisher. But the 
writer who was not so popular almost always found a pub- 
lisher and almost always was assured of a certain hono- 
rarium. Of a popular author's books, there followed 
cheap editions at six shillings, or three-and-six, and even 
two shillings, and these were pretty sure to sell largely. 
They were bought by the " readers created by the School

Boards," or by those otherwise created who wished to 
possess a copy of the work of a favorite writer, and who 
probably could not afford to pay for the high priced 
library edition. Of the works of the second-rate and 
third-rate novelists, it often happened that the publisher 
never issued cheap editions because he felt they would 
not "pay." If he did, he brought them out as "yellow 
backs." But what happens now? A popular author sells 
in his tens of thousands in six-shilling form, while the 
author not so popular counts his readers in scores or at 
most a few hundreds. Editions cheaper than the six- 
shilling editions have been practically abolished since 
they did not " pay," and now that the more esteemed 
works of the better known writers have been published 
at sixpence, in rivalry of the sixpenny magazine, there is 
still less excuse for bringing out cheap editions of second 
and third-rate novelists. It comes to this : that the aboli- 
tion of the three-volume novel has practically ruined the 
chances of the second-rate and third-rate authors, who 
now feel that they must either accept ludicrously small 
41 advances " or be satisfied with the public and income 
which they obtain from " serialising " their stories. Pub- 
lishers are becoming more and more chary about " touch- 
ing " fiction. The popular author swallows up the profits ; 
the others are not worth the trouble expended on them. 
Sir Walter says " a great many novels are published 
which bring in nothing; but they ought not to have been 
published at all." What does he mean by this? Does 
he mean to say that Mr. Thomas Hardy's " Far from 
the Madding Crowd," Mr. George Meredith's "The 
Egoist," Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights," and 
others, should never have been published? Certainly, 
these on their first editions brought nothing either to 
anthor or publisher. If his remark does not include this 
meaning, it contains very little for serious consideration. 
Publishers who show Sir Walter Besant returns of sales 
which amount to a great many thousand copies have their 
own reason for giving him the information. I am con- 
tent to let the relative values of publishing novels at 
thirty-one-and-six and at six shillings be judged from 
the sales of Sir Walter's own books. Let Sir Walter 
Besant publish the actual sales in the British Isles of bis 
latest novel, " The Changeling," side by side with the 
sales of " All Sorts and Conditions of Men " in three- 
volume and six-shilling forms; and I feel assured that 
the result of the comparison will bear out my original 
statement TEMPLE SCOTT. 



L.ITKRARY NOTES. 

" Laboratory Exercises in Anatomy and Physiology," 
by Mr. James Edward Peabody, is published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. 

" The Story of Religions " is a small popular manual 
by the Rev. E. D. Price, which has just been published by 
Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & Co. 

A pretty edition of " Departmental Ditties and Other 
Verses," by Mr. Rudyard Kipling, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & Co. 

" The Gate to Vergil," by Mr. Clarence W. Gleason, 
is planned upon nearly the same lines as the correspond- 
ing volumes on Caesar and Xenophon. It is published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

The " Reader's Handbook " of the late E. Cobhain 
Brewer was revised and enlarged by the compiler just 
before bis death, and is now issued by the J. B. Lippincott 



Co. in its new and final form. It is now a volume of 1243 
pages, and more useful than ever as a manual of refer- 
ence in miscellaneous reading. 

Brown & Co. is the style of a publishing house re- 
cently incorporated in Boston. Mr. John Howard Brown 
is president of the Company, and Mr. Frederic Lawrence 
Knowles the literary adviser. 

It is announced that " The Critic," of New York, is 
hereafter to be issued from the publishing house of G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. Mr. J. B. Gilder and Miss J. L. Gilder 
will continue to edit the magazine. 

" Absolom's Hair " and " A Painful Memory," both 
from the " Nye Fortaellingir " of 1894, make up the 
contents of Volume VIII. in the new English edition of 
Herr Bjornsen's novels, published by the Macmillan Co. 

The " Wit and Humor " series is the name given to 
a collection of three small volumes published by Messrs. 
George W. Jacobs & Co. The contents of the volumes 
are derived, respectively, from English, Scotch, and 
Irish sources, and are properly indexed. 

"Astronomy," "Botany," and "Flowers," are the 
respective titles of three small books of popular science 
just put forth by the Penn Publishing Co. Mrs. Julia 
McNair Wright is the author of the first two, and Mr. 
Eben E. Rexford of the third. The books are neatly 
printed and illustrated. 

The Macmillan Co. publish three German texts, as 
follows : Schiller's " Jungfrau von Orleans," edited by 
Dr. Willard Humphreys ; Goethe's " Iphigenie auf 
Tauris," edited by Dr. Charles A. Eggert ; and Frey- 
tag's " Die Verlorene Handschrift," edited (and greatly 
condensed) by Miss Katherine M. Hewett. 

" Among My Books " (Longmans) is the title of a vol- 
ume edited by Mr. H. D. Traill, and made up of the 
cauteries contributed by various writers to the weekly 
issues of " Literature." There are upwards of a score 
of these familiar talks, and their writers include many 
distinguished men and women. The book has no discern- 
ible unity, but makes pleasant reading for all that. 

The Modern Language Association of America will 
hold its next annual meeting at the University of Vir- 
ginia (Charlottesville, Va.) on the 27th, 28th, and 29th 
of this month. The Central Division of this Association 
will hold its annual meeting on the same days, at the 
University of Nebraska (Lincoln, Neb.). Interesting 
programmes have been provided for both gatherings. 

Four volumes just published by Messrs. Charles Serib- 
ner's Sons complete the new library edition of the works 
of Mr. George Meredith. The final volumes give us " One 
of Our Conquerors," " The Amazing Marriage," " Lord 
Ormont and His Aminta," and the collected " Poems." 
The latter volume is complete, except for the French 
" Odes," which have recently been published in a separ- 
ate volume. 

Volume XII. of the new edition and translation of the 
fiction of Tourgue*nieff, prepared by Mrs. Constance 
Garnett, and published by the Macmillan Co., includes 
three stories, " A Lear of the Steppes," " Faust," and 
" Acia." We are particularly glad to have the " Faust," 
that gem of purest ray serene among Tourgue'nieff's 
stories, at last made accessible to English readers within 
the coven of a book. 

A new edition (the fourth) revised and corrected in 
the light of the most recent investigations, of Mr. John 
Bigelow's " Life of Benjamin Franklin," has just been 
published in three volumes by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
For nearly a quarter of a century now this has been the

standard biography of Franklin, and is here given what 
we may suppose to be its definitive form. Nor is it 
likely ever to be superseded by a more complete or trust- 
worthy work. 

M. Le*on Daudet's life of his father, and M. Ernest 
Daudet's " My Brother and I," both translated by Mr. 
Charles de Kay, will be published in this country by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., in accordance with a special 
agreement with the late novelist's family. The biogra- 
phy is such a chronicle of French home life as seldom 
finds its way into type, for Daudet's house was his work- 
shop, wherein the services of all the inmates were his to 
command. " My Brother and I," which is included in 
the same volume, is said to equal in interest the pictures 
of Alphonse Daudet given in his son's work. 

" The Home Life of Great Authors," published over 
ten years ago by Mrs. Hattie Tyng Griswold, won a con- 
siderable measure of popular favor for its sympathetic 
and unaffected delineation of the literary personalities 
with whom it dealt. A companion volume, compiled 
upon the same plan, and called " Personal Sketches of 
Recent Authors " (McClurg) has just been issued, and 
deserves a word of praise, both for its pleasant manner 
of narration and for the exceptionally good photographs 
which have been chosen to illustrate it. Among the 
eighteen subjects included are Renan, Arnold, Huxley, 
and Miss Rossetti, among the dead, and, among the liv- 
ing, Mr. Howells, Mr. Kipling, and Count Tolstoy.

FOR CHRISTMAS. 

Mr. Dole begs leave to call the attention of lovers of Omar 
Khayyam to his limited Breviary bilingual edition of the 
Rubaiyat. Only the last 100 copies remain, and these have 
been specially bound in full calf by Sanford. They are par- 
ticularly desirable for Christmas gifts. This is the last chance

EXILED FOR LESE MAJESTE. 

By JAMES T. WHITTAKER. 

A Story of Russia under Nicholas I. and an 

Exile in Siberia. 

" This is a romance filled with thrilling events in its de- 
scriptions of Russia, Siberia, and the frozen North. . . . This 
portion of the book will be as entertaining to the young 
reader as to the older. Mastodon tusks are found, extinct 
volcanoes discovered, caves fallen into, and all sorts of excit- 
ing happenings take place . . . but it is also filled to the 
brim with information about the country, its customs, and 
history." Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, July 3, 1898. 

"... But ' Exiled for Lese Majest4 ' is, above all things, 
a story, and an exciting story at that. The incidents out of 
which it is woven are dramatic. The characters have many 
narrow escapes and thrilling adventures. The flight from the 
prison, the descent of the Lena, and the many subsequent 
perils of the personages in whose fortunes the author has en- 
listed our sympathy are so vividly depicted that the reader 
finds himself in a sort of mental race, and so absorbed in these 
children of the imagination that he cannot lay the book down. ' ' 
Memphis Commercial Appeal, October 23, 1898. 

" As a romantic narrative ' Exiled for Lese Majeste' ' has 
had its equals if not its superiors in recent literature. . . . But 
as a mine of valuable information on all sorts of topics this 
notable work surely has not had its equal since ' The Swiss 
Family Robinson.' "New York Times, July 30, 1898.

"BOB, SON OF BATTLE." 

T ITERAEY editors are the most difficult 
j class of people to interest in new novels : 
they have to review stupid ones till they get 
weary of the whole thing. 

Moreover, this is the season when the re- 
viewer grows dizzy with the rush of new books 
demanding attention. Yet we have received 
from the literary editors of two large news- 
papers letters inspired by their enthusiasm for 
" Bob, Son of Battle " (a novel by a new writer, 
Alfred Ollivant), which went to them in the 
ordinary routine. 

The letters come from Maryland and Cali- 
fornia. Both say the story is so remarkable 
that the writers wish to know if other people 
have appreciated it as they have. That the 
latter are beginning to do so is shown by the 
fact that a second edition of five thousand 
copies has just been printed. 

We 'd like to send you a copy of the book, 
postpaid, on approval. It you want it, send us

THE VICTORIAN ERA SERIES 

The series is designed to form a record of the great movements and developments of the 
age, in politics, economics, religion, industry, literature, science, and art, and of the life-work 
of ito typical and influential men. 

Under the general editorship of Mr. J. Holland Rose, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, 
Cambridge, England, the individual volumes will be contributed by leading specialists in the 
various branches of knowledge which fall to be treated in the series. 

The volumes will be handsomely bound in cloth, with good paper and large type, suitable 
for the library. Price, $1.25 per volume. 

NOW READY: 

THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY 

By J. HOLLAND ROSE, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge (editor of the series). 

An interesting historical account of British Radicalism of the first half of the century fills a large part of the 
volume. . . . On the whole, we are able to praise the volume as a moderate and impartial view of the demo- 
cratixation of the Constitution Athenaeum. 

In dealing with his subject Mr. Rose displays considerable independence of thought, joined to accuracy of 
detail and clearness of exposition. His style, too, is vigorous; and on the whole he has made a good start for 
what promises to be a useful and instructive series. Glasgow Herald. 

If the remaining volumes of the " Victorian Era Series " are written in as able, temperate, and judicious a 
spirit as the first, " The Rise of Democracy," by J. H. Rose, M.A., we anticipate for it a great and deserved 
success Manchester Guardian. 

For all who wish to get an unbiased view of the Radical movement in England during the present century 
its benefits, its faults, and its limitations this little book can be unhesitatingly recommended Aberdeen Journal. 

fti:U/,L THE ANGLICAN REVIVAL lidT 

By J. H. OVERTON, D.D., Rector of Epworth and Canon of Lincoln. 

We can highly recommend this able history of Canon Overton's, and we hope it may clear the minds of 
many as to the history of " The Anglican Revival." It is by no means a party or an extreme statement of facts, 
but rather a judicial record of the religious events that have moulded " The Anglican Revival " in the Church of 
England during the reign of Queen Victoria. Church Review. 

Dr. Overton's contribution to this series of handy books is a volume that is well worth reading by men and 
women who care to know just where the Established Church is now, and what are its tendencies Norwich 
Mercury. 

The author . . . writes without bias and with the true spirit of the historian only anxious to secure his 
facts and to " nothing extenuate nor aught set down in malice." Weekly Echo. 

Of the movement itself, and its main actors, Canon Overtoil gives an excellent account. He has the literature 
of the subject at his fingers' ends, and the story could not be better told Sheffield Telegraph. 

'/ JOHN BRIGHT 

By C. A. VINCE, M.A., late Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. 

We have every reason to regard this as the sanest, most impartial, and intelligent life of John Bright that 
has been given to the public. Birmingham Gazette. 

Mr. Vince has had the good sense to allow John Bright, as far as possible, to speak for himself, and he has 
shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures 
in the Queen's reign. Speaker. 

An excellent little life of Bright, with a chapter on Bright's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable. 
It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our 
time, and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant. Athtnceum. 

This little book seems to us, in its way, a remarkable success. It is a model of what such a sketch should be 
sober, well- written, with the matter well-ordered, and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with 
enthusiasm. A cademy. 

Mr. Vince's biography of Bright is a model of its kind. It gives us an admirable picture of the man whom 
Lord Salisbury rightly characterized as the greatest master of English oratory that recent generations have seen.

FOUR IMPORTANT BOOKS 

CATHERINE SFORZA: A STUDY. 

By Count PIER DESIDERIO PASOLINI. Authorized Edition, translated and prepared, with the 

assistance of the Author, by PAUL SYLVESTER. 

Count Pasolini is a lineal descendant of the hereditary enemies of the Sforza family. His work is enriched 

by numerous illustrations, facsimiles of handwriting, seals, and quotations from some five hundred letters of the 

A TU r^r*l^Tr^ *r r"*/"^ r* fy A Madonna of Forli. It combines the charm of romance 

\^J\ I If } 1^1 1\ C h> P* O T\jLi A with the di g nitv of history, and brings within the reader's 

ken, not only the militant princess who held the fort of 

St. Angelo against the Conclave (thus arresting the affairs of Europe until her own were settled), who circum- 
vented Machiavelli and defied Cesar Borgia, but the private woman in her court and home, her domestic and 
social relations. 

In one volume, demy 8vo, 400 pages, illustrated with numerous reproductions from original pictures 
and documents. Price, $3.50 net. 

THE PALMY DAYS OF NANCE OLDFIELD. By EDWARD ROBINS. 

This handsome volume contains many stories of the life and times of Mrs. Nance Oldfleld. Mr. Eobins's aim 
has been to give a faithful presentment not only of the famous actress herself, but also of her whole environment. 
Thus all the theatrical and much of the literary life of the 

period comes within the purview of his book. Steele and ^^^VI^^^Fi OL. DFIFI D 
Addison, Booth and Gibber, are among the many celebrities 

who figure in its pages. Special interest attaches to the description of the most notable performances in which 
Mrs. Oldfield took part. 

In one volume, 8vo, cloth, illustrated with a photogravure frontispiece and twelve other portraits. 
Price, $3.50 net. 

ROBERT, EARL NUGENT. By CLAUD NUGENT. 
A Memoir, with letters, poems, and appendices. Extracts from the Preface : 

" In presenting a memoir of Robert, Earl Nugent, my purpose is rather to introduce his transactions with 
men whose names have become famous in history than to give a biography of the man himself. ... It would be 
quite easy to represent him as a monster of profligacy; it would not be difficult to picture him in the light of a 
large-minded, liberal, and judicious politician of high statesmanlike qualities. He has been virulently attacked 
, . __ _ _ _ , r^m. TT< koth on * ne mora ^ and * ne political side; but there is considerable ground 
r~^^\ |c I ^ |^ LJCj.bI^ 1 ^ or sus pi c i n tk a t * ne onslaught on his morals was prompted by a desire' 

to injure him as a politician. ... It is in the letters that I venture to 

believe the main interest will be found. That is to say, not in Nugent himself so much as in those brilliant and 
distinguished men with whom he was associated. The mere mention of the names of Pope, Goldsmith, Chester- 
field, Pulteney, Newcastle, Dunk Halifax, Pitt, Chatham, Hardwicke, Grenville, Horace Walpole, Lord John 
Hervey, Henry Pelham, Henry Fox, the father of Charles James, Wyndham, not to swell the list any further, is 
an indication that the correspondence is likely to contain matter of high interest. . . . The history of his marriages 
is a remarkable one, and it is not surprising that ' his skill in marrying rich widows ' should have excited unfriendly 
comment. . . . There was also another side to Robert Nugent's character. He was a poet, a bon vivant, and a wit." 

In large 8vo, cloth, with many reproductions in photogravure and half-tone from family portraits 
by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, and others. Price, $3.50 net. 

THE JEW, THE GYPSY, AND EL ISLAM. 

By the late Capt. Sir RICHARD F. BURTON, K.C.M.G., F.R.G.S., etc. Edited, with a Preface 
and brief Notes, by W. H. WILKINS, author of " The Romance of Isabel Lady Burton." 
The announcement of another book from the pen of the famous Orientalist and explorer will be received with 
interest by a great number of people. This book, which is not a translation, but an original work, is composed, 
as the title indicates, of three parts, each separate and complete in itself. Of these, the first two, " The Jew " 
and " The Gypsy," are deeply interesting ethnolog- 

ical studies, containing the fruits of much personal 11? lvldl^\.IxD Fjl^JIxTlOl^ 
observation and original research. The third part, ^ ^ ^ ^ 

" El Islam," is a profound and sympathetic study of the Muhammadan religion. Thus the volume is made up 
of some of the most valuable of the unpublished Burton MSS., to which so much interest is attached, and forms 
an admirable example of the work of the famous Oriental traveller in fields which he made his own. 

In large 8vo, cloth, with photogravure portrait of the author from a picture by the late Lord 
Leighton. Price, $3.50 net.

have been read but show underlined passages here and there. The 
effect of these ' marked passages ' on certain dramatically pictured cases 
among the patients gives opportunity for some keen study of human
