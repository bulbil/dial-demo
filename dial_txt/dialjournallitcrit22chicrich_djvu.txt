"To say outright that a, hook or an edition is good is to be too bold. Nothing is easier than criticism which sums up a subject 
in an adjective. Whether it be very profitable is another matter. I imagine that, if a writer gives the facts and perhaps some 
opinions on the facts, the reader will be able to draw his own conclusions. There are, however, readers who like to have their 
opinions, like their clothes, ready made, and for such there can be no harm in saying that a good little edition of Boswell's

THE CHICAGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

There is a wide-spread opinion to the effect 
that American history is comparatively unin- 
teresting. It is a hasty opinion, formed, as a 
rule, before the mind is capable of a real exer- 
cise of judgment in such matters, but, its lodg- 
ment in the brain once secured, the notion is 
difficult of eradication. The average young 
American of receptive and generous instincts 
grows up in the belief that the history of En- 
gland and Continental Europe, even the his- 
tory of Greece and Rome, is essentially more 
attractive than the history of his own country, 
and he studies the latter, if at all, from a sense 
of duty rather than because it really appeals to 
his imagination. It is not difficult to under- 
stand why this attitude should be so common. 
There is something peculiarly arid about the 
ordinary text-book presentation of American 
history to the children of our schools. In the 
first place, this presentation is predominantly 
political, and the child can know nothing of 
politics in any deep sense. What he craves is 
color and picturesque quality, and what he gets 
is a discussion of colonial governments and the 
problems of taxation. Even the war-episodes 
in our history offer him a questionable solace, 
for they gild but thinly the pill of political dis- 
cussion, and too often serve as a vehicle for the 
inculcation of prejudices rather than of princi- 
ples. When the child who has had such an intro- 
duction to historical study grows old enough to 
select his own reading, and finds his way into 
some library, the appeal made to him by the 
rich literature of history and poetry and ro- 
mance that has gathered about the annals of 
the older world is a hundred-fold as great as 
the appeal of the meagre literature that clus- 
ters about the annals of his own land. 

To the trained and mature mind, historical 
interest is essentially a matter of development, 
and the study of history affords no delight equal 
to that of tracing the evolution of some insti- 
tution, or form of society, or national ideal. 
But readers of trained and mature minds are 
comparatively few, and the many who seek 
pleasure in historical reading demand allure- 
ments of a wholly different nature. As far as 
these more numerous readers are concerned, 
the essential fact in the philosophy of interest

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



is contrast, the comparison, implied or explicit, 
between the life of humanity as known to per- 
sonal experience and the life of other periods 
as revealed by the records of the past. Now, 
Americans are altogether too prone to assume 
that their own history is not old enough to 
afford the degree of contrast that makes his- 
tory supremely interesting ; their imagination 
demands some such fillip as is afforded by grim 
castles or armored knights or the pomp and 
pageantry associated with the courts of old-time 
princes and potentates. This demand, it may 
be admitted, is not without a certain justifica- 
tion, but we must also remember that contrast 
is not altogether determined by the lapse of 
long terms of years. One might go back to the 
Middle Ages without finding any greater con- 
trast, or any more potent in its appeal to the 
well-regulated imagination, than is offered the 
Chicagoan who, in the choicest residence por- 
tion of his city, is reminded by a monumental 
bronze that upon this very spot, in the year 
1812, the Indians massacred almost to a man 
the slender garrison that vainly sought to de- 
fend what was then an outpost of frontier civ- 
ilization. If this simple fact be not sufficient 
to kindle the imagination, one can hardly escape 
a thrill upon being told of the brave woman 
who, with her babe in her arms, was then car- 
ried off by the Indians, made to run the gaunt- 
let by her brutal captors, and forced to march 
from Chicago to Mackinac, and from Mackinac 
to Ohio a weary journey of fifteen hundred 
miles, done for the most part in the dead of win- 
ter saving from death the child, who, to-day 
still numbered among the living, makes good 
the claim that the period of a single existence 
may span the entire history of a community of 
well-nigh two millions of souls. 

In the address made the other day by Presi- 
dent Edward G. Mason, at the formal opening 
of the new home of the Chicago Historical So- 
ciety, there was probably nothing that excited 
so great an interest as this tale of womanly 
heroism and devotion, nothing that brought 
so vividly to mind the significance and the 
romantic coloring of that history of the North- 
west with which the Society is chiefly con- 
cerned. And the surroundings of the speaker 
were well calculated to deepen the impression 
thus made. Memorials of kings and soldiers, 
of statesmen and priests, all associated with the 
region in question during the French, English, 
and American phases of its history, were about 
the speaker on every side, and heightened the 
ffect of the living words with which the pano- 



rama of Northwestern history was unrolled by 
him. The portraits, the autograph letters, the 
bronze reliefs of Indian worthies, the historical 
paintings, the maps and charts, the books and 
pamphlets, the relics of every imaginable sort, 
that make up the collections of the Society, 
and the noble building which is the storehouse 
of all these things and the home of all who are 
interested in them, assumed a new and symboli- 
cal significance to the brilliant audience that had 
gathered for this dedication, and that realized 
more fully, perhaps, than ever before, how the 
city of the Great Fire strikes its roots deep into 
the past, and is, in some sort, the historical 
focus of the territory that stretches all the way. 
from Quebec to New Orleans, a territory which 
was won from barbarism to become the battle- 
ground of conflicting civilizations, and is rich 
with the memories that give to historical study 
its salt and its savor. 

The Chicago Historical Society has had a 
chequered existence. It was founded forty 
years ago, largely through the efforts of the 
Kev. William Barry, who took a leading part 
in its work until the time of his death. The 
organization occupied temporary quarters for 
twelve years, and then, in 1868, took posses- 
sion of a building provided by the generosity of 
friends of the Society. Into this building the 
collections were removed, and they steadily 
increased during the three years following, when 
everything was destroyed in the conflagration 
of 1871. No one knows fully or exactly what 
was lost by that disaster, for all catalogues and 
records were swept away with the collections 
themselves. The library included over one 
hundred thousand numbers of all kinds, while 
the miscellaneous treasures of the Society 
included many things absolutely unreplaceable. 
The most precious of these was the original 
draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, the 
librarian nearly losing his life in a vain at- 
tempt to rescue this document from the flames. 
After the shock of this disaster was fairly 
over, the Society started upon a new collection, 
but again, in 1874, fire destroyed all that 
had been brought together during the three 
years of resumed activity. Nothing daunted, 
a third start was made, cheered by the devotion 
of friends, and substantially encouraged by the 
realization of a large bequest made some years 
before by Henry D. Gilpin, of Philadelphia, a 
gentleman whose fortune had been derived in 
part from early investments in Chicago realty, 
and who had chosen to express his gratitude in 
this very acceptable way. Thanks to this be-

quest, and to the gifts and subscriptions of 
other friends, the Society is now in possession 
of a building conveniently planned and archi- 
tecturally satisfactory, a building which is note- 
worthy among Chicago structures dedicated to 
other than money-making pursuits, and abso- 
lutely proof against the element that once held 
the city in its grasp. Its officers claim that the 
building is the only perfectly fire-proof struc- 
ture in the country, if not in the world. As 
for its contents, when we consider that they 
have been brought together within a quarter of 
a century, they make a remarkable showing ; 
and we should add that this showing is due, 
more than to any other cause, to the zeal and 
devotion of President Mason, whose keenness 
of scent, and persistence, when it comes to run- 
ning down a portrait, or manuscript, or rare 
volume, or other document relating to the his- 
tory of the Northwest, are quite extraordinary, 
and have resulted in great enrichment of the 
Society's collections. 

The work that has been done by this Society, 
and that will continue to be done by it, has a 
farther- reaching significance than at first ap- 
pears. In the narrower sense, viewed merely 
as a contribution to the mitigation of Chicago, 
it has a distinct and positive value. But in a 
far wider sense, it may be taken as a sign of 
the movement that has done so much during 
the past generation to broaden and deepen his- 
torical study in American fields. American 
history may no longer be regarded as a drama 
worked out upon the narrow theatre of a few 
sea-board colonies. The monumental work of 
Francis Parkman has made that view hence- 
forth forever impossible. From this time on 
we must not only reckon with the English in 
New England and the Dutch in New Amster- 
dam, but also with the French in the Missis- 
sippi Valley and the Spanish in the Southwest 
and regions of the Pacific. The march of civ- 
ilization across a continent must be our theme 
rather than the sowing of the seeds of religious 
and civil liberty upon the shores of the Atlantic. 
Important as that plantation was, we now see 
it to have been but a small part of the New 
World history, and our horizons have widened 
steadily with the enlargement of our knowledge. 
The Chicago Historical Society is but one of 
many organizations scattered all over the coun- 
try, that are engaged in building anew the 
foundations of American history. With their 
aid, and with the aid of such private enter- 
prises for the collection of material as are 
exemplified by the great work of Mr. H. H. 



Bancroft, of such noteworthy publishers' un- 
dertakings as the forthcoming edition of the 
" Jesuit Relations," and of the new spirit of 
critical scholarship that now inspires the study 
of American history in our universities, the 
subject is at last taking its proper place in our 
interests, attracting to itself its due measure 
of our attention, and winning its deserved rec- 
ognition as one of the most essential elements 
in American culture. 



COMPOSITE AUTHORSHIP. 

Despite proverbial philosophy to the effect that 
two are better than one, and a threefold cord is not 
quickly broken, it has by common consent been con- 
ceded that in most departments of Art, especially 
of creative art, a man must work by himself alone. 
The largest orchestra composed of the most varied 
instruments may interpret the music of Haydn, but 
no alien hand can without dissonance add a single 
note to the composition. Painters and sculptors, as 
well, find their career a long path which they must 
tread alone. 

And yet, as if to show that no rule can be so com- 
plete as to avoid exceptions, we have constantly with 
us the anomaly of Composite Authorship. This 
anomaly, however, has its limitations. No epic 
worthy of the name, or lyric even, can lay claim to a 
multiple paternity. Those unconscious accretions 
of harmonic folk-lore, which have given us the older 
national ballads and, according to some scholars, 
Homer himself can scarcely be regarded in the 
light of composite productions. It is safe to say 
that all the poetry and most of the prose that con- 
stitute literature have been in each case of note the 
work of a single hand. To this rule dramatic lit- 
erature offers a conspicuous exception, and we have 
numerous instances where drama distinctly so-called, 
or poems of a dramatic character, have been the 
product of differing personalities. The reason is 
obvious : so many works of art require for their de- 
velopment a homogeneousness of conception involv 
ing the greatest concentration on the part of one 
man a homogeneousness that would be marred by 
extraneous suggestion or alien interference. Dra- 
matic art, on the other hand, implies a versatility of 
conception all its own. Comedy is taken from the 
epoch of marriage, which is in the early centre of 
life ; tragedy deals with the sudden ending of life, 
usually at maturity each with its appropriate dra- 
matis per sonce. Given the raw material, which is 
the same with all peoples and in all languages, the 
heavy father, the inevitable villain, the futurus- 
futura lovers, and all of what might be termed the 
living properties of the stage, the task is to evolve 
from these ever-recurring elements new situations 
grave or gay. It is easy to see how such labor 
might be lightened by the conspiring hand of an

associate author bringing to the work widely differ- 
ing views and personality. 

In France it is by no means uncommon to find 
plays written by two, three, or more co-laborers, 
which fact seems to confirm the impression that the 
French are essentially a dramatic people. The 
reason for such prevalence naturally gives rise to 
conjecture : Are the French less captious than other 
people? How do they manage in this combination 
to assuage those jealousies so common among au- 
thors elsewhere? I can only reply, that as lawyers 
who are habitually pitted against each other in 
verbal combat are notoriously the most fraternal 
among themselves, so, perhaps, this nation of duel- 
ists, whose contentiousness and punctilio have long 
been a proverb, may present a similar anomaly. Are 
they not better able to agree to disagree than are 
any other? better able to lay aside punctilio and 
private feud, when the occasion is the consideration 
of artistic truth? There were two brothers in dra- 
matic art, both Alsatians, and the one peculiarly 
complementary of the other ; that is to say, one was 
what is popularly called a genius, at all events, 
his fecundity and facility were remarkable, but 
he greatly needed the restraining hand of his part- 
ner in labor. Need I mention Erckmann-Chatrian ? 

A remarkable instance of composite authorship 
is found in that fascinating fairy tale for adults, 
" Foul Play " by Reade-Boucicault. Much of its 
great success is attributable to the extraordinary 
versatility of its authors. Two men more unlike in 
aim and effort could scarcely be conceived. I had 
it from Mr. Boucicault himself that this literary 
team began with alternate chapters assigned to each 
author. Later on, they agreed to a sort of competi- 
tive effort in which each should in turn write the 
story into a dilemma of unsurmountable difficulty, 
leaving the solution to his successor; each author 
was thus on his mettle, and the combined result 
was a series of stirring adventures and hair-breadth 
escapes which possess an inherent flavor of variety 
and make all readers young again in memory of 
" Robinson Crusoe." Many times did those rival 
authors rub their gleeful hands at the plight in which 
the story should be found by him who followed. For 
instance, in the elaboration of the plot it becomes 
necessary to diffuse information over a distance of 
some thousands of miles of sea, in order that a pair 
of castaway lovers might be duly rescued. Here Mr. 
Boucicault rests his case. But the redoubtable 
Charles Reade, nothing daunted, contrives to fasten 
the pregnant missive not to the neck of a dove 
bound to Holy Land, as in Crusading times but to 
the leg of a wild duck in whose speed and staying 
powers he had confidence : and so, the story and the 
lovers prosper. 

The combining of differing personalities in dra- 
matic authorship is easily accounted for : Most lit- 
erary men, having but scant knowledge of stage 
traditions and requirements of the stage, are obliged 
to call to their aid others who possess precisely the 
knowledge which they lack. For this reason, Bul- 



wer, for example, was constrained to associate him- 
self with the most eminent actor of his day, Ma- 
cready, under whose management and suggestion he 
re-wrote " The Lady of Lyons," the most popular of 
modern plays. 

Instances of joint authorship in American letters 
are rare, especially in high places, and, so far as I 
know, are not very successful, except perhaps in the 
lower walks of the drama. In this department 
of art there are, I regret to say, too many cases 
of a literary partnership rather ignoble in its char- 
acter. 

Allusion has been made to the securing of variety 
and novelty through joint authorship ; it is like that 
combination of alien elements, say copper and zinc, 
needed to produce the galvanic spark not to for- 
get withal that an added element of mercury in the 
helix may quicken and intensify that same spark. 
" In joining contrasts lieth love's delight," exclaims 
Sheridan Knowles. For " love " read " melodrama," 
in the application to our subject. It is a pleasure 
nay, a luxury to " hunt in couples," especially 
when the outcome is profitable as well as agreeable. 
I recall at the present moment such an instance of 
the dual number in authorship, which owes its suc- 
cess to the different tempers of those composing the 
partnership. Moreover, being friends, they find in 
this exercise an admirable means of working off 
such small ferments and desagrements as in any 
other situation might prove inconvenient or even 
divisive. The opposite of each other in every par- 
ticular, including sex and nationality, their views 
differ on almost all subjects except such as relate to 
their art. Every matter of technique, every question 
of literary propriety, lies open to discussion, which, 
though it may sometimes be strenuous, is always 
profitable. Their varying views afford the " spice of 
life"; and after a period of wholesome storm and 
stress devoted to their modest muse, they emerge 
whole-hearted, happy and, as before, the best of 
friends. S. R. ELLIOTT. 



THE FAIRY TALES OF THE RACE. 



Who told them first, the poet or the sage, 
These fairy tales that run from age to age ? 
The children of the North and of the South 
Repeat them and repeat, they are in every mouth. 

Behold, they were not made as other songs; 
No one lone bard have they, but nameless throngs 
In sundered lands have toiled upon the theme, 
Whose fabric from the loom flows perfect, without seam : 

A perfect whole, yet wrought by hands diverse; 
The shadowy warp from India or from Perse; 
Then, Greece gave beauty; Scandinavia left 
A changeful and a mystic light upon the weft. 

Thou simple child, pleased with thy fairy tale, 
Thou knowest not what truth it might unveil; 
For old it is as are those pictured scrolls 
That in Egyptian tombs shall serve returning souls.

COMMUNICA TION. 

"THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your editorial entitled " The Great American Novel," 
printed in a recent issue of THE DIAL, reflects a senti- 
ment which is not mere ephemera the desire of the 
American to be adequately represented in universal 
literature, to the taste and intelligence of the civilized 
world ; the ambition of a people who are making a new 
trial of political and social living to be rightly under- 
stood and justified. Mr. James Lane Allen tells us that 
the Anglo-Saxon reading public know three gentlemen 
Don Quixote, Sir Roger De Coverley, and Colonel 
Newcome, all types of a high civilization ; but that in our 
own literature there is no American who can rank with 
these three immortals. " We find him in our biography, 
in our history, in the army, in the navy, in the univer- 
sity, on the bench; we find him in the leadership of our 
national life, but we cannot find him as large as life in 
our fiction." He also offers an explanation. He con- 
tends that the writer must be as highly civilized as his 
characters; that he stands to his work as the mason to 
his wall; that he may be above the plane of his char- 
acters and write down to them, but that he cannot be 
below and write up, a disconcerting commentary 
which suggests painful introspection. 

To my own thinking based upon a reading of 
American fiction admitted to be impressionable rather 
than critical, general rather than comprehensive the 
Great American Novel has not appeared. It may be 
that it has come, and that the writer in THE DIAL is 
hugging a secret, albeit his cautious words imply incer- 
titude. But awaiting enlightenment from the peaks, 
and disregarding editorial wiles, I assume, perhaps to 
my ultimate confusion, that this book is not yet born, 
but that it is looked for, as a lord looks for an heir who 
shall be the mainstay of his name. 

The time has passed when no European reads an 
American book; but we must confess that one depart- 
ment of our literature fiction still remains distinctly 
provincial. To realize this, we have but to recall the 
names of those authors who best portray the life of 
to-day and of a brief yesterday : Mr. Bret Harte, Mr. 
George W. Cable, Mr. James Lane Allen, Mr. F. Hop- 
kinson Smith, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, Mr. Joel 
Chandler Harris, Miss Mary Wilkins, Miss Murfree, 
Mrs. Hodgson Burnett, and Mr. William D. Howells. 
The writings of these authors are largely studies 
many of them exquisite and perfect in their way 
of local temperament, customs, manners, and speech; 
but we lack the novelist whose sweep is as broad as the 
continent and whose insight is as deep as the sea, the 
genius who can synthetize the emotions and aspirations 
of that vast human amalgam, that new ethnic product, 
known as the American people. 

THE DIAL insists that the representative novel must 
be imbued with the passion of a true democracy; that it 
must gain color and strength from political motive, and 
thereby touch one of the most representative chords of 
our national character; that, ethically, it must be worthy 
of a nation whose civilization is based upon Puritanism ; 
and that it must make the reader " feel how far the true 
aristocracy of heart and intellect overshadows the sham 
aristocracy of wealth and of social position, won by 
1 smartness,' that distinctively American vice." All 
this ground is well taken, but I beg to suggest that the 
way to it is difficult and full of pitfalls. 



A novel which attempts to delineate the life of a great 
people, dealing with their political, social, metaphysical, 
and religious expressions and tendencies, may easily de- 
generate into a mere exploitation of theory, into a polit- 
ical pamphlet or a didactic treatise. However original 
and unconventional the author may be, he will be bound 
by the one canon of his art which appears to be funda- 
mental and inviolable. The serious purpose of the novel 
is to amuse. It must interest; it must make the reader 
forget the dining and the retiring hour. " If it does 
not," to quote a dictum of Sydney Smith, " story, lan- 
guage, love, scandal itself, cannot save it." It is 
certain that the work in question must be suffused 
with one quality which permeates the nature of the 
whole American people and makes them preeminent of 
all peoples a subtle and abundant humor. Devoid of 
this, it would be no true American book. Humor is a 
powerful auxiliary of our democracy, and he who would 
interpret us must possess it and reckon with it. The 
innumerable contributions and clippings, the scintilla- 
tions of wit and fun, which appear in the columns of 
the ten thousand newspapers of the United States exert 
an enormous social influence. The American press is 
nothing if not satirical; but it is rarely inane. Its humor 
is intelligent. This humor does not consist in grinning 
through a horse-collar, nor does its laugh suggest the 
vacant mind. If it is sometimes vulgar, it is also 
pointed; and "many vulgar things," says Lord Bacon, 
" are often excellent good." Our busy-body press in- 
vades the home, the marital relation, the courts, the 
camp, the church, the hovel, and the mansion, with en- 
tire impartiality. It displays a genial sensibility to 
human whims and oddities, notes incongruities, mental 
and moral, and is the sleepless foe to falsehood, sham, 
impudence, affectation, pomposity, hypocrisy, and cant. 
It delves into all social and political differences, ridi- 
cules exaggerated fears, stills passionate storms, and 
helps to tide over crises. It turns a white light upon the 
characteristics of all classes, sects, and races, leads us to 
know one another, and thus assists to assimilate a nation. 

Recurring to the theme, I agree with THE DIAL that 
politics should be a leading motive of the new novel. He 
who would thoroughly explore the extent and force of 
it in a people whose mind is an horizon, who would real- 
ize their vast potentialities for good and evil, must go 
back a little to the heroic period, to the tumult of civil 
war, when two civilizations met in conflict, the one 
modern and the other feudal, when men were marshalled 
by soul-compelling issues into armies that had empires 
in their brains. It requires a Michelo Angelo to picture 
that epoch a universal soul. The pedant and the par- 
ticularist may go their way. After the stress and de- 
struction of war came an era of new industrialism, an 
insweep of materialism, of selfish individualism, an 
amassing of wealth colossal beyond compare, the divi- 
sion of society along economic lines, the aristocracy of 
wealth, the wage-earning class, corporations, trusts, cor- 
rupt special legislation, strikes, lockouts, federations of 
labor, and socialism. American society is pushing the 
law of evolution to its limit; it is undergoing changes, 
kaleidoscopic and complete; and it is doubtful if the 
several epochs of our history can be treated together or 
by the same hand. The civilization of to-day differs 
greatly from that of the last generation, and a gulf 
wider than the centuries separates it from the Colonial 
period. Puritanism has been spun out to an exceeding 
fine fibre, although it may still be seen in the woof. 

The adjustment to new social and economic conditions

means the brewing of another storm which may involve 
institutional wreckage. The future is big with events, 
and their course will in some wise be affected by the 
conduct of our growing aristocracy of wealth. The 
vulgarity of this class, their ostentation, immorality, and 
abasement before European social idols, are making 
them a byword of contempt the world over. That there 
is dignity and nobility in simplicity is a lesson which 
they have not learned. Benjamin Franklin, George 
Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and William E. 
Gladstone are types of men whom they do not under- 
stand. It is the Disraelis who appeals to them, he 
who changes his name as though he were ashamed 
of it, and cross-garters himself like a Malvolio. The 
pernicious influence exercised by our garish plutocracy 
in imitating the follies and vices of a decadent privi- 
leged order is evoking sharp criticism. Mr. Andrew D. 
White says, in the December "Forum": "It must be 
confessed that during recent years there have been some 
conduct of rich men and several careers of rich men's 
sons fit to breed nihilism and anarchy. Many wild doc- 
trines among the poor may be traced back to senseless 
ostentation among the rich. Glorification in our press 
of this woman's ' tiara ' and that woman's wardrobe ; of 
this young millionaire's genius in driving a four-in- 
hand, and that young millionaire's talent in cooking 
terrapin; of some Croesus buying or begging his way 
into the society of London or Paris; of social or finan- 
cial infamy condoned by foreign matrimonial alliances ; 
what wonder that men out of work in tenement houses, 
or struggling with past-due mortgages on the prairies, 
should be led by such examples to look at all property 
as robbery ? " 

In the same issue of " The Forum," an outsider, Mr. 
Gold win Smith, comments as follows: "Few things in 
social history are more unlovely or more likely to pro- 
voke righteous indignation among the people than the 
matrimonial alliances of the upstart and sometimes ill- 
gotten wealth of New York with the needy aristocracy 
of Europe. What must an American workman feel 
when he sees the products of American labor to the ex- 
tent of scores of millions sent across the Atlantic to buy 
nobility for the daughter of a millionaire ! The thing 
is enhanced by the extravagant splendor of the nuptials. 
Nor are these marriages merely offences against feeling 
and taste. They are an avowal that American wealth 
is disloyal to the social principles of the Republic." 

It will be the congenial task of the coming novelist, 
not only to picture the American gentleman, but to vin- 
dicate the American woman from degrading misrepre- 
sentation. To portray her in all her physical and spir- 
itual grace, her intellectual vivacity, innate refinement, 
and elevation of character; to differentiate her from 
those who pose as representative of our country and are 
accepted as such, the shallow, materialist, tuft-hunting 
type who crave and obtain social notoriety, whose func- 
tions, boudoir, face and figure, jewels and gowns, and 
intimate clothing, are photographed in the columns of 
the daily newspaper. Our sham aristocracy of wealth 
offers a shining mark for the hurtling shaft of satire, a 
shaft which will penetrate even the hide of this pachy- 
derm. This aristocracy, so-called, is young yet, and 
unfortified by tradition, and therefore there is reason 
to believe that it will learn something, that there will 
be an interval of sanity, and some faint accession of 
self-respect. May a new and greater Thackeray speed

THE MEMOIRS OF A FRENCH POLITICAL 
JOURNALIST.* 

That the life-story of that fiery radical and 
stormy petrel of French political journalism, M. 
Henri Rochefort, is eminently one of adventure 
and vicissitude, and well-spiced with racy per- 
sonalia and caustic comments on men and events, 
goes, as the Gallicists phrase it, without saying. 
In his preface, M. Rochefort tells (by way of 
antithetically illustrating his own career) of the 
wife of a baker with whom his parents dealt, 
who for thirty-five years hobbled daily at noon 
from her chamber to the shop, from whence she 
did not stir until eight in the evening, and who 
used boastfully to account for the silvering of 
her locks by saying, " What can you expect ? 
Life is such a rush nowadays ! " With M. 
Rochefort life has indeed been a "rush" a 
hurly-burly of ups and downs and capricious 
turns of Fortune's wheel of which even the 
worthy bakeress could have formed but a slight 
conception. He says : 

" I have at one time or another experienced nearly 
every imaginable sensation. For more than a quarter 
of a century I have been like a man on a switchback 
railway, continually plunged from the highest summits 
into the darkest depths." 

In one chapter, for instance, we find M. Roche- 
fort borne by the mob in triumph, like another 
Marat, from his prison cell in Sainte Pelagic 
to a seat in the National Defence government ;. 
in the next, he is dragged in chains to Ver- 
sailles, and paraded for an hour about the 
streets of that city amid the execrations of his 
whilom adherents. "I can still," he says, 
" bring to my mind's eye the figure of an old 
man, attired in a closely buttoned frock-coat, 
who waved a red umbrella, and shouted in the 
direction of the procession, ' It 's Rochefort I 
Flay him alive this time ! ' " and flayed alive 
the injured apostle of popular rights would 
perhaps have been had not the gates of his new 
prison opportunely dammed the rising tide of 
sansculottism. What a fine satiric stroke of 
destiny, worthy of the days of '93, would it 
have been had the radical-republican editor of 
the Lanterne been marched to his fate by his 
" sovereign people " to the tune of the old cry, 
" a la lanterne ! " Saved thus from his 
" friends," M. Rochefort is presently found in 
his condemned cell rehearsing the scene of his

impending final exit. Like a true Frenchman, 
he would fain die with eclat; and it will be 
admitted that M. Kochefort's notion of eclat 
here or, let us say, of the etiquette of the 
scaffold was strictly sansculottic and in har- 
mony with his principles. He says : 

" I do n't know how I should have died, but I recol- 
lected that General Lahorie was executed on the plain 
of Grenelle with General Malet, and that, turning to the 
officer in charge of the firing party, he spat in his face and 
cried ' There ! that 's for you and your emperor ! ' This 
line of procedure appeared to me to be the correct one, 
and I had decided to follow it. I should have spat in the 
face of the commander of the party, and have said 
' There ! that 's for you, you dirty capitulationist ! ' " 



Fate interposed as usual, however. M. Roche- 
fort was not destined to be shot, hanged, or 
even drowned, as the event showed ; and we 
presently view him, a sea-sick yet defiantly 
abusive political exile, caged (literally) in the 
hold of a ship bound for the Antipodes (for " the 
most cannibalistic part " of them, he takes care 
to say), his solitude relieved mainly by a choice 
company of convict communards, rats, roaches, 
etc. How M. Rochefort escaped, like a second 
Edmond Dantes, from his bleak rock of exile ; 
how ha traversed this continent amid a blaze 
of, as we suspect, rather pinchbeck popularity 
for his fame here was tarnished by his alleged 
complicity in the murder of Archbishop Dar- 
boy and in the orgies of the Paris Commune 
generally ; how he turned up, as waspish and 
aggressive as ever, at London ; and how he 
eventually reached Paris, after the Amnesty, 
and received a tremendous ovation at the hands 
of the mob that had recently wanted to "flay " 
him (probably the red - umbrella'd man was 
again shouting with the rest), all this is 
graphically told in these diverting volumes. 

M. Rochefort was born in 1831, and entered 
the College of Saint Louis at the age of twelve. 
As a pupil he seems to have been distinguished 
chiefly for insubordination and an ape-like turn 
for mischief that early betokened the future 
firebrand of the Lanterne, the Marseillais 
(that " veritable journal of Bashi-Bazouks," he 
complacently styles it), and the Mot <P Ordre. 
Of scholastic honors we find no mention. " I 
had not," the writer says, " a pedantic mind." 
When the revolution of 1848 broke out, the 
latent spirit of revolt flamed up in the breast of 
Master Rochefort ; and he promptly assaulted 
his tutor, scaled the College wall, joined the 
rioters, and marched with a column of the sov- 
ereign " unwashed " on the Tuileries whence, 
luckily, the " bourgeois king," bourgeois to the 
last, had already fled in a cab, wisely prefer- 



ring that vulgar vehicle to a tumbrel. Success 
justifies everything. So our truant, instead of 
being soundly and properly birched by his 
tutors, as he must have infallibly been at an 
English school, was " congratulated " on his 
return and obtained a half-holiday. At this 
period, says M. Rochefort, " sentimental things 
alone had an interest for me." "Paul and 
Virginia " (tabooed at the school for its pro- 
found immorality') was his favorite book ; and 
he took to turning out verses, " just like turn- 
ing out boxwood snuff-boxes." One of these 
productions he sent to Beranger, and was re- 
warded by that great man (whom he had com- 
pared with the republican heroes of antiquity) 
with the following note : 

" Is it true that you are only fifteen years old ? Ah, 
if at that age I had written such well-turned and poet- 
ical verse, I should have believed that I was called to 
high destinies. At fifteen I scarcely knew ortography." 

After leaving school, M. Rochefort became 
a clerk at the Hotel de Ville, and soon began 
to write for the journals, notably the Figaro 
and the Charivari; and his caustic pen and 
envenomed assaults on the government soon 
pushed him to the front, as the most bitter and 
voluble journalistic Thersites of the hour. " I 
felt," he says, " a growing horror of the beastly 
Asiatic despotism in which France seemed to 
be stewing." We are inclined to think that 
any government whatever would have seemed a 
" despotism " in the eyes of M. Rochefort, pro- 
vided only it prevailed to prevail constituting 
the great political crime, as to conspicuously 
prosper constitutes the great social one, with 
men of his temperament. An article in the 
Nain Jaune soon involved him in a duel the 
second one of a long series which was pre- 
ceded by a laughable incident. On the morn- 
ing of the meeting, as M. Rochefort was pre- 
paring to join his seconds, he was surprised by 
a call from a young actress of the Varietes. 

" ' Is it true that you are going to fight ? ' she asked, 
in a concerned manner. ' Yes,' I replied, quite touched 
at this mark of interest shown at so early an hour in 
the morning. But do n't be frightened ; I 'm not 
buried yet.' ' Oh, I know that; and that's why I have 
come to beg you to do me a great service.' ' I 'm in a 
bit of a hurry, but ' ' Exactly. Here 's what it is. 
All my comrades at the Varie'te's have had men fight 
duels for them. Up to the present time I have n't been 
able to find a single one to fight for me. In fact, I 've 
always been unlucky.' 'Well?' 'Well! If you would 
do me a favor, and an enormous favor, you will tell 
everybody that you have fought the duel on account of 
me, because a gentleman insulted me. Whether you 
fight for that or for anything else, what difference can 
it make to you ? ' . . . The poor child went off desolate, 
repeating that she had always been unlucky."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



Naturally, Napoleon III., the then political 
head and therefore ipso facto the chief crimi- 
nal in the country in M. Rochefort's eyes, was 
the main target for the latter's poisoned shafts. 
" The Scapin of the Tuileries " is one of his 
mildest epithets. " Ah ! " he exclaims, exult- 
antly, " that unfortunate person of the sover- 
eign. I twisted and wrung it like an old towel. 
Any weapon was good enough for me to use to 
sap the respect with which they affected to sur- 
round tha't official dummy." M. Rochefort is 
right : " any weapon " from rapier to blud- 
geon, and from Chassepot to " stink- pot " 
plainly seems, on his own evidence, to have 
been " good enough " for him." Not a few of 
the samples of the abuse he showered on the 
persons of Emperor and Empress and their 
entourage, and triumphantly exhibits in his 
book, are too coarse or too palpably slanderous 
for quotation here. Others are merely mali- 
cious and rather amusing such as the squib 
describing how a trained rabbit was habitually 
set up a few yards in front of the Emperor 
(who posed as a Nimrod, but seems to have 
been a sportsman of the " Nathaniel Winkle " 
order) at the Imperial hunts at Compiegne, 
and how the sagacious animal pretended to fall 
dead before the royal double-barrel, only to 
re-appear a few minutes later to go through the 
same performance. 

The editor of the Lanterne was compelled to 
seek safety in Belgium not long after the estab- 
lishment of that peppery sheet. This was M. 
Rochefort's first hegira ; and it is needless to 
say that after each of his several flights he soon 
turned up again at Paris, prompt and alert to 
renew his attack on the existing regime what- 
ever it happened to be. We have no doubt that 
had M. Rochefort, after one of these returns, 
found, say, the illustrious Bakunin installed at 
the Tuileries, and the communistic Utopia, free 
goods, free speech, free love, and the rest of it, 
actually under way, he would have promptly 
ranged himself with the opposition, and trained 
his guns on his former friends. It may be noted 
that Edmond About, who had plainly gauged 
his man, once asked M. Rochefort, in the Gaul- 
ois, " What would happen if the actual regime 
were replaced by his political ideal, and he found 
himself no longer in a position to indulge his 
temperament of systematic opposition ? " The 
proper answer to this question is that, M. 
Rochefort's political ideal being that which is 
not, and his cardinal principle being " what- 
ever is, is wrong," it would be impossible for 
him ever to be placed in a position where that 



temperament could not be indulged. Let us 
add that a few years later, when the Commune 
ruled Paris, M. Rochefort was soon actually 
chased from the city by the besieged radical 
" Reds," only to fall into the clutches of the 
besieging conservative Versaillais, who, on their 
side, promptly transported him to New Cale- 
donia. Thus, there being two conflicting gov- 
ernments in France, M. Rochefort was in oppo- 
sition to both of them ; and had there been half 
a dozen, he would doubtless have been the com- 
mon shuttlecock of all. In fine, he was born to 
be a thorn in the side of constituted authority. 

During his exile at Brussels M. Rochefort 
was the guest of Victor Hugo, of whom he has 
much to say in a very readable chapter. M. 
Hugo's " den " seems to have been a tiny attic, 
so lightly roofed that the sky peeped through 
the tiles and the rain occasionally filtered 
through on the Olympian head of the occupant. 
A servant, says the author, would have refused 
to inhabit such a garret ; yet it was there that 
the poet's masterpieces were composed. M. 
Hugo never sat down, he adds, but composed 
" while making the four strides to which he 
was limited by the smallness of his cage." Vis- 
itors were strictly excluded from the " cage " 
during working hours ; but once M. Rochefort 
was permitted to enter. He says : 

" I opened the door of the tiny room, and stepped 
inside with all sorts of precautions, for fear of treading 
upon the wet sheets of manuscript which were lying 
about on the mantelpiece, the bed, and the floor. I 
approached him like a cat walking on hot bricks. A 
proof of the rapidity with which he worked was that 
the ink on the medium-sized, bluish paper he used was 
scarcely dry before a second sheet was well-nigh com- 
pleted. I noticed this a score of times. It is true that 
he invariably wrote with goose-quill pens, which splut- 
tered occasionally, and left undryable blots en route. 
His manuscript was so spaced that each sheet contained 
ten lines at the outside. I rather indiscreetly asked 
him how much he had earned when he threw one of his 
pages of copy aside. ' About a hundred francs a page,' 
he replied." 

The author quotes some interesting observa- 
tions of the poet's on the value of style, made 
during a discussion of the merits of Stendhal's 
Rouge et JVbir of which M. Rochefort had 
asked " How can you explain the success of 
the book, which has already engrossed two gen- 
erations ? " M. Hugo replied : 

" But I 'm not engrossed in French grammatical 
errors. Every time I try to decipher a phrase in your 
favorite book it is as though I were having a tooth 
drawn. The only works that have a chance of travers- 
ing centuries are those that are properly written. Do 
you think, if Voltaire's Candide were in the same style 
as Rouge et Noir we should still read it? Montesquieu 
lives because he is well written. M. Stendhal can never

live because he did not conceive for an instant what 
writing was. Nobody has more admiration than I have 
for the almost miraculous insight of Balzac. His is a 
brain of the first order. But it is only a brain ; it is not 
a pen. Style is the art of expressing every sensation 
by the aid of words. Read Balzac again. You will 
very soon notice that he is ignorant of his language, and 
almost invariably fails to convey the excellent things 
he wants to say. For this reason his hour to sink into 
oblivion will come much sooner than is thought." 

M. Rochefort admits that he found, on exper- 
iment, the re-reading of Balzac an impossible, 
or at least an irksome, task ; while as for Sten- 
dhal's novel, he says : 

" I bitterly regretted, on trying to read it again, that 
I had not been satisfied with my first perusal as well as 
with my first impression. I defy any literary man, who 
has the slightest respect and love for style, to read be- 
yond the third chapter." 

We shall take leave of M. Eochefort's book 
by saying that it is lively, pungent, and en- 
grossing throughout not, we think, a book 
likely on the whole to inspire regard for its 
author, but unquestionably one that few read- 
ers will lay aside without finishing. E. G. J. 



A MECHANICAL, SYSTEM OF INFALUBL.E 
LOGIC.* 

The clamorous volume entitled "Infallible 
Logic " is heralded by a prospectus only less 
remarkable than the work itself. We are 
brought face to face with " one of the greatest 
intellectual discoveries made since the time of 
Aristotle, a system as certain and as infallible 
in its results as the Multiplication Table," more 
refined and accurate in its power "to test, 
weigh, and measure propositions " than are 
" chemical tests for the detection of impurities 
in material substances," or " the most delicate 
balances ever constructed for the purpose of 
weighing the smallest grains of matter," or the 
microscope for revealing " objects which are 
invisible to the unaided eye "; and making insig- 
nificant the power of " the largest telescope in 
enabling us to see the distant stars in space in 
comparison with the power which this system 
has to bring to light the latent meanings of 
complex propositions." This system is infalli- 
ble ; " this system cannot err." We are assured 
that it is easy to learn, is especially adapted to 
the "use of lawyers, ministers, teachers, stu- 
dents, and everyone who is interested in the art 
of reasoning," and, when the system becomes 
generally known, will, the author believes, " be

Reasoning. By Thomas D. Hawley, of the Chicago Bar.

the means of bringing men to a substantial 
agreement in nearly all the disputed questions 
in law, theology, political economy, ethics, and 
kindred sciences." The daily press proclaims 
the originator of this marvellous system as " the 
new Lord Bacon," and the world may be sup- 
posed to be anxiously waiting to have the mirac- 
ulous seed sown and bear fruit. 

A work appearing under such auspices is 
likely to receive the neglect or denunciation 
which it rightly merits. It must be a very 
eager and dauntless " general reader " who 
would drive his plough through this hard and 
stony field ; and the hope of becoming an infal- 
lible reasoner may well seem less and less allur- 
ing as the barrenness of the seven hundred pages 
through which the author has carried his dis- 
cussions, chiefly with the desire " to economize 
the time of the reader," becomes more and 
more apparent. The critic could hardly be 
seriously censured, who, disgusted with the 
extravagant claims made for the work, decides 
to pass it by with a few contemptuous phrases 
and spend his energies on something more prof- 
itable. It would, perhaps, be unwise to recom- 
mend this course as the fairest and most judi- 
cious one to pursue ; but, in spite of the " infal- 
lible logic," when the provocation is great 
enough it is human to err. 

The present reviewer, having found it pro- 
fessionally desirable to cut a path through this 
tangled mass of underbrush, and being desirous 
that his own experience of a course which did 
not run smooth shall be of service to others, 
has decided to pass in review the main features 
of the work and to investigate slightly its claims 
to infallibility. Its author is evidently a sin- 
cere and ernest student of logic, with sufficient 
powers of application and ingenuity to discover 
and reason out the complex relations involved 
in logical thought. For the results thus reached 
he is quite ready to claim a degree of origin- 
ality that may be true enough when applied to 
his own mental experience, but is hardly appro- 
priate in view of the accumulated experience of 
the logical world. He refers to other writers, 
but seems incapable of assimilating the posi- 
tion of these writers, satisfying himself with a 
few literal and disassociated citations to sup- 
port his own views, much as a schoolboy would 
do in a perfunctory composition. He has found 
a diagrammatic system for representing the 
simple relations of terms, propositions, and the 
ordinary deductive inferences a very helpful 
device in keeping clearly before him the fre- 
quently puzzling statements and conclusions 



14

which premises may yield ; and this system of 
diagrams is the infallible logic. Diagrams very 
similar in scope and purpose have been used 
by Venn, Pierce, Marquand, " Lewis Carroll," 
and others ; and while Mr. Hawley uses his 
diagrams somewhat differently, the only point 
of originality worth calling attention to is the 
fact that he uses them less carefully and dis- 
criminatingly. Having a very pronounced (and 
shall we say legal ?) tendency for saying every- 
thing at great length and with the maximum 
" padding " of tautologous terms and iterative 
variations, the author swells his volume to its 
forbidding stoutness without doing more than 
showing that his system is capable of express- 
ing and interpreting the ordinary deductive 
relations treated by modern logicans. A care- 
ful examination fails to reveal anything more 
than this. 

We may now investigate the claims to infalli- 
bility, and Mr. Hawley's fitness to be a logical 
pilot, by taking up a few of his own reasonings 
with no other instrument than the homely but 
still useful common-sense. On page 32 we find 
this piece of logic :J ftM^'- ae&fli 

"If anyone should fail to see that the proposition 
Salt is chloride of sodium ' can be read backward as 
well as forward, it can be easily demonstrated by using 
the Law of Excluded Middle, thus: Chloride of sodium 
is either salt or it is not salt.' If we suppose that it is 
not salt, then, since by our premise, Salt is chloride of 
sodium,' salt would be not salt, which is impossible 
according to the Law of Contradiction ; therefore chlo- 
ride of sodium must be salt." 

The result happens to be true ; but this kind of 
reasoning might lead to curious consequences. 
Let us apply it to the recent campaign. If 
anyone should fail to see that the proposition 
"Those who voted for Palmer were Demo- 
crats " can be read backward as well as for- 
ward, it can be easily demonstrated by using 
the Law of Excluded Middle, thus: "The 
Democrats voted either for Palmer or for some- 
one else." If we suppose that they voted for 
someone else, then, since by our premise "Those 
who voted for Palmer were Democrats," those 
who voted for Palmer voted for someone else, 
which is impossible according to the Law of 
Contradiction, therefore the Democrats voted 
for Palmer, q. e. d. This is an old trap (the 
catch consisting in the applications of the " or " 
and the implied " all "), but it is interesting to 
note that it may be set with new bait. Of 
course if all propositions were identities, the 
reasoning would hold, but would be unneces- 
sary. But all propositions are not identities, 
however convenient it might be for logicians to 



have them so. The " infallible logic " con- 
stantly insists on shaping all propositions so 
that the bolus will go down the receptive tract 
of the " system," woefully distorting them in 
the process and rejecting as extra-logical all 
that will not be so distorted. The distinctions 
between universal and particular statements, 
and between affirmative and negative, are set 
to one side as mere " conversational " distinc- 
tions ; and then it is proved that they must be 
illogical because they do not readily appear on 
the diagrams. Surely if logic cannot take ac- 
count of the actual forms of statements in com- 
mon use among mankind, it shirks one of its 
main duties and privileges. 

In detecting fallacies our author's success is 
no greater. He objects to " If all A is B and 
all B is C, then all A is C," by pointing out 
that we should accordingly argue " If this 
rose is red and red is a color, then this rose is 
a color." In solving problems his errors are 
numerous. In the problem of section 366, he 
cites a simple problem and answer, and asserts 
that the conclusion, which does not agree with 
his own, is incorrect. It can be very easily 
shown that the text is right and the " infallible 
logic " is wrong. In the complex problem of 
section 910, he fails to get the conclusion alto- 
gether, and puts forward as conclusions certain 
general provisos which the premises have al- 
ready stated as clearly as was necessary. The 
stronghold of the " infallible logic " is con- 
sistency ; but the system is anything but con- 
sistent. On page 306 we are told that in this 
system a certain type of proposition is " never 
worked backward," although no reason for this 
is given ; but on page 61 this same proposition 
is read backwards. The same proposition is 
expressed in one way on pages 62, 303, 346, 
but in another way on pages 310, 341 ; while 
on page 462 we find as the equivalent of a given 
form an entirely different proposition from that 
used in the rest of the work. Add to this a 
great deal of reasoning in a circle, much am- 
biguity, repeated misconceptions of the state- 
ments of the " old logic," great inadequacy of 
scope, and the list of logical fallibilities em- 
bodied in this work would still be incomplete. 

But, after all, these details are uninteresting 
except for the professional student. One fun- 
damental difficulty with the author is the be- 
lief that a mechanical appliance will have the 
same efficacy in the mental as it does in the 
material world ; that if only we could discover 
how, reasoning would be as easy as breathing. 
He fails to see that with his diagrams he really

does all the work in order to get the material 
into shape for the diagram and to interpret it 
after it comes out. That this is not easy is 
shown by the fact that the author himself more 
than once trips up in doing it, and has already 
issued a postscript of errata of this kind ; and 
it is also shown by the wide gaps in many of 
the " therefores " scattered throughout the so- 
lutions of problems. In this respect he is 
much like the Hibernian hod-carrier who was 
very joyful over the easy job he had secured, 
for he had only to carry up the bricks and mor- 
tar while the other fellows did all the work. 
But this objection aside, it has been shown that 
diagramatic methods are excellent in simple 
problems, but inadequate in complex ones ; the 
same conclusions which the author arrives at 
laboriously and circuitously can be reached 
most easily by symbolic methods. 

Another fatal difficulty is the author's inabil- 
ity to appreciate the difference between what 
is correct and what is natural. Mere formal 
correctness is a very estimable quality, but it 
cannot be made very useful unless it is adapted 
to the actual nature of the mind's operations. 
Mr. Hawley believes " that the brain is a think- 
ing machine, and this system represents the 
mechanical nature of the brain's activity in the 
reasoning process "; the psychological and the 
historical survey of man's doings show very 
clearly that the products of men's brains are 
very complex and cannot be represented by 
mechanical formula however ingenious. 

The most charitable view to take of Mr. Haw- 
ley's essay is to look upon the extravagance of 
its claims as an example of bad taste and noth- 
ing worse, and to look upon his other faults as 
the natural shortcomings of a self-made man. 
He has planned his road without assistance from 
experts, and it naturally will not bear the test 
of the chain and the theodolite. And, it is not 
charity, but mere justice, to recognize that he 
has put into this work considerably more close 
thinking than could be found in any one of half 
a dozen " Logics " written within half a dozen 
years by very respectable professors going 
over the traditional logic in the traditional 
way. Mr. Hawley clearly appreciates that the 
traditional logic is hopelessly defective. Logic 
as a discipline has sadly degenerated since the 
days when it held sway as queen of the curric- 
ulum. It gave place to studies that bore more 
intimate relation to the problems of life. John 
Stuart Mill succeeded in rehabilitating the 
study of inductive logic as a pursuit helpful to 
students of science, by showing the intimate 



relation between inductive methods and scien- 
tific advance. Deductive logic has been regen- 
erated by a small coterie of mathematical stu- 
dents, but their labors have not as yet permeated 
into the college text-books to any considerable 
extent. There is still hope that the study of 
logic may again be seated in the high place 
which it can worthily fill, if only it shakes off 
its traditional superfluities and excresences and 
appears in a garb suited to the present needs. 
But this time cannot be hastened by publish- 
ing portentous systems of infallible logic ; on 
the contrary, the study of logic must always 
derive one of its truest and most forcible 
raisons d'etre from the well-acknowledged fact 
that it is human to err. JOSEPH JASTROW. 



Two VIEWS OF WALT WHITMAN.* 

There are, roughly speaking, three attitudes 
toward Whitman : that of complete non-accept- 
ance, that of acceptance so complete that it 
involves the rejection of his opposites like Ten- 
nyson, and (thirdly) the attitude of readers 
who hold fast by the poets whose power and 
form are equal, readers who are nevertheless 
able to love and be helped by the crude and 
powerful work of Whitman without being 
swept off their feet. 

Mr. John Burroughs is of the extreme Whit- 
manite wing. He admits frankly that he is 
prejudiced. His estimate is personal. True 
Whitmanite that he is, he does not try " to get 
himself out of the way and let humanity judge." 
He would interpose his pages of comment be- 
tween the poet and the public. His style echoes 
that of the chants except where he uses the 
conventional language of criticism. There is 
a bit too much of this ; old Georgio Vasari's 
unsophisticated speech would have fitted better 
a study of Whitman. Mr. Burroughs repeats 
some of his ideas and phrases half a dozen times, 
and then one longs for a little of the " formal 
art " which the book decries. 

Mr. Burroughs's whole-hearted appreciation 
of Whitman is welcome ; it helps us. But one 
is sorry to see his appreciation of other poets 
injured. He considers Tennyson a refined 
pigmy beside Whitman (though these are not 
his words). The older saying that " Whitman 
is Emerson turned beast " is changed here to

the truer, less forcible " Whitman was Emer- 
son translated from the abstract into the con- 
crete." One feels Emerson's conception of the 
soul to be the vastest yet formed, but there have 
been vaster souls. One cannot help drawing a 
like distinction in Whitman's case when his 
lover exalts him over Wordsworth. " Words- 
worth had been my poet of nature, of the seques- 
tered and idyllic ; but I saw that here was a 
poet of a larger, more fundamental nature ; 
indeed, of the cosmos itself. Not a poet of dells 
and fells, but of the earth and the orbs." That 
kind of language will tempt people to say that 
there may be great poets of small things and 
small poets of great. The antithesis, however, 
is mainly false, for Whitman is almost as far 
from being small as Wordsworth's subjects are. 
Tennyson, Byron, Swinburne, Arnold are all 
belittled beside Whitman ; Shelley's poetry is 
to Mr. Burroughs " a melodious baying of the 
moon." To see that " ineffectual angel " as a 
dog indicates a peculiar pair of eyes. 

Mr. Burroughs claims a place for Whitman 
beside Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and the 
Hebrew prophets. As a lover of Whitman, I 
protest. It is not good for him to be praised 
like that. Homer is unconsciously a great 
artist all the time, while Whitman is only an 
artist in the height and heat of rare emotion. 
Mr. Burroughs speaks of Whitman's " power 
of identification with the thing contemplated." 
Compare this power in Whitman and in Shake- 
speare. In the first, the object becomes one 
with the thinker ; in the second, the thinker 
becomes one with the object. In the first we see 
only the radii running into the centre of self, 
in the second we forget the centre and see the 
radii touching at myriad points the circumfer- 
ence of human knowledge. Mr. Burroughs uses 
a similar figure, and brings out well the differ- 
ence between Whitman and the great imper- 
sonal poet. Without wishing to push a figure 
of speech too far, I think if we had to choose we 
should prefer to look outward to the circumfer- 
ence rather than inward to the centre. Mr. Bur- 
roughs says things which show that his appre- 
ciation of Shakespeare, of Dante, of Homer, is 
lessened by his absorption of Whitman. One 
fancies him reading them with the intention of 
seeing that they are not greater than " the good, 
gray poet." He " wants the sun to rise and set 
without any poetic clap-trap." May not the sun 
rise like this ? 

"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain- tops. ..." 

4 Behold the dawn, in russet mantle clad, 
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill." 



Not for Mr. Burroughs if you take him at his 
word. Says he : "I always think of a regula- 
tion verse form as a kind of corset which does 
not much disguise a good figure, though it cer- 
tainly hampers it, and which is a great help to 
a poor figure." Help a poor poetic figure, verse 
certainly does ; " the usual trappings and dress 
uniform of poets " do certainly lose impressive- 
ness on little men. But does Shakespeare's 
" regulation verse form " hamper his figure ? 
One is forced to believe that Mr. Burroughs 
thinks so. In feeling deeply the wild occa- 
sional harmonies of Whitman, Mr. Burroughs 
has partly lost the power to feel the magic of 
Shakespeare's verse, the power to rejoice in his 
immortal marriages of form and spirit. For 
my part, I would not gain power to feel Whit- 
man at the expense of my power to feel Shake- 
speare. 

Mr. Burroughs, by claiming too much for 
" old Walt," reminds everybody of what he is 
not. He really has seen deeply into " Leaves 
of Grass," and has felt deeply its beneficent 
power. But for the time being, he looks at 
Whitman through a telescope and at other 
poets with the naked eye. He loves Whitman 
not too well for that is impossible but not 
wisely. 

Mr. Thomas Donaldson gives us a charming 
and intimate account of " Walt Whitman the 
Man." He tells us things that no one else 
could have told, and publishes for the first time 
certain autograph letters and poems of Whit- 
man. Mr. Donaldson's short, direct sentences 
have an everyday air that befits his point of view. 
He makes one see clearly that there were " two 
Whitmans," and does not disguise the fact that 
he loves the man more than the poet. There 
is not a gushing word in the book ; it is full of 
firm fact-telling, and the facts told are those 
welcomed by a worthy curiosity. In private 
life we see Whitman to be anything but " the 
savage old man " Mr. Burroughs sees in him. 

In his preface Mr. Donaldson tells how Whit- 
man helped him make the book by sending 
packages of manuscripts, and adds : " He knew 
I would not bother the public with my views of 
his work solely, but would rather present the 
man Whitman in his everyday manner." But 
Mr. Donaldson's views of the work in the chap- 
ter on " Literary Aims " will not bother the 
public. The views are too just, too true, for 
that. He says : 

" The mysteries of life, unsolved in creation, life and 
death, can be talked about, and this Mr. Whitman has 
well done; but they cannot be solved by the human 
mind. The mystery remains, Whitman or no Whitman.

. . . His chief hope is to aid man to rely upon himself, 
and to cast aside fears and doubt and walk forth to the 
battle of life a self-reliant knight, determined to sub- 
due nature and the elements to his own use and that of 
his fellows; and to be happy and contented. . . . Ex- 
pressing no opinion as to his method, one thing I am 
sure of Mr. Whitman possessed in a masterly degree 
true poetic genius." 

Few cultivated people who have heard the 
chants well read the chants wherein the good 
gray poet is deeply moved will question this 
statement. 

In contrast to Mr. Burroughs's slighting atti- 
tude toward Tennyson is the tone of Whitman's 
correspondence with the rugged and refined 
English poet. The letters here printed show 
the attraction the two large natures had for 
each other. 

Mr. Donaldson's bit of a book will help Whit- 
manites to an 'almost personal familiarity with 
their poet ; and it should make those who " can't 
stand him " see that his principles do not, in a 
strong nature like his own, lead to evil of any 
kind. The book is written wisely and well.

THE DEGENERACY OF THE AMERICAN 
NEGRO.* 

Much has been said, on both sides, regarding 
the present condition and outlook of the Afro- 
American. Most of what has been said has 
been written by prejudiced observers. It is 
much, then, to have a thoughtful work by an 
unbiased foreigner, dealing with a wide range 
of reliable statistics. Mr. Hoffman, author of 
" Kace Traits and Tendencies of the American 
Negro," by birth a German, is a professional 
statistician. His work represents ten years of 
collection and study. 

Just now a notable tendency exists to min- 
imize the importance of racial differences. 
Ratzel's " History of Mankind " shows this 
strikingly ; and Dr. Brinton, in his latest course 
of lectures, upon Primitive Religions, exem- 
plifies it completely. Yet it is certain that race 
differences are real and persistent. Races have 
been produced by long-continued operation of 
given conditions upon given masses of popula- 
tion. It makes little difference whether the 
environment acts selectively or modificatively, 
in the long run the result is the same ; dif- 
fering environments produce differing races. 

*RACE TRAITS AND TENDENCIES OF THE AMERICAN 
NEGRO. By Frederick L. Hoffman. (Publications of the 
American Economic Association. ) New York : The Mac- 
millan Co. 



Race characteristics are physical, mental, 
moral. Where a race is well-marked and dis- 
tinct, its peculiar characteristics are astonish- 
ingly persistent. When the surroundings of a 
race vary, one of two things must happen : the 
race must change to meet the new conditions, 
or it must die. The longer marked race char- 
acters have been fixed, the less likelihood is 
there of change. It is easily conceivable that 
race characters may be so strong in some cases 
that change in a new environment may be im- 
possible and death inevitable. It seems as if 
most ethnologists might agree upon these few 
fundamental ideas. 

The negro type is ancient. The Egyptian 
monuments demonstrate its existence four 
thousand years ago. Unless the physiography 
of South Africa changes profoundly, the negro 
type will probably exist there four thousand 
years hence. Some two hundred years ago, 
persons of this type were brought to America ; 
new comers have arrived until recently. These 
persons were property, and valuable property. 
They were therefore surrounded by an artificial 
environment, in which at least to a degree 
they flourished. They were fed and clothed, 
housed and directed. They were protected in 
a measure from the hostile influences of their 
new environment ; racial tendencies of a de- 
structive kind were held in check by interested 
ownership. Everyone rejoices that slavery in 
America has been abolished ; everyone admires 
the moral grandeur of emancipation ; everyone 
must respect the vigorous if usually unwise 
and harmful philanthropy that has sought to 
help the freed negro. But what are the race 
traits and tendencies of the American negro 
to-day? Mr. Hoffman's book answers the 
question. To many optimistic commonplace 
thinkers, his answer will be a shock ; to readers 
who recognize the force of heredity and the 
importance of race differences, it will be food 
for serious thought. 

Mr. Hoffman first studies the simple statis- 
tics of population ; he then investigates the 
data supplied by anthropometry, the question of 
race amalgamation, and the social and economic 
conditions and tendencies. He claims that 
there is no danger of future numerical suprem- 
acy of the negro in the South. Instead of 
beyig rapidly increasing, the negroes are really 
losing. " He has failed to gain a foothold in 
any of the Northern States as an agricultural 
laborer ; he has remained in the South ; he has 
failed in colonization." There is, however, a 
dangerous tendency to move from the rural 



18 



THE DIAL

districts into the cities, and in these cities the 
negroes concentrate in the most undesirable 
and unsanitary sections. " The further ten- 
dency to concentrate into certain sections of the 
South, especially those which already possess 
a preponderating colored population, presents 
the most serious aspect of the problem." 

In his study of vital statistics, the author 
brings out many interesting facts ; he concludes 
that the negro is at all ages, but particularly 
at the earlier ones, subject to a higher mortality 
than the white. " This is largely the result of 
an inordinate mortality from constitutional and 
respiratory diseases. Moreover, the mortality 
from these diseases is on the increase among 
the colored and on the decrease among the 
whites. ... In the struggle for race supremacy, 
the black race is not holding its own. ... Its 
extreme liability to consumption alone would 
suffice to seal its fate as a race." 

Data of an anthropometric kind " prove con- 
clusively that there are important differences 
in the bodily structure of the two races, differ- 
ences of far-reaching influence on the duration 
of life and the social and economic efficiency 
of the colored man." Such data as are avail- 
able seem to show that he is degenerating. 
There is a considerable mass of testimony that 
" before emancipation he presented in many 
respects a most excellent physical type, a type 
even superior to the average white man exam- 
ined for military service under similar condi- 
tions." The freeman cannot and does not guard 
himself against the destructive influences of 
his new home as his master could and did guard 
him. 

Study of criminality in the two races gives 
astonishing results. Of the total prisoners in 
the United States in 1890, nearly 30 per cent 
were colored ; the negro, however, forms but 
11 per cent of the population. The figures 
examined in detail show that 36 per cent of the 
homicides, 40 per cent of the rapes, and 39 per 
cent of the assaults in our country were due to 
this 11 per cent of population. Some, perhaps, 
may think that this result is due to prejudice 
against negro criminals in Southern States. 
Nowhere has the black man a better chance 
than in Pennsylvania. Yet there 16 per cent of 
the male prisoners and 34 per cent of the female 
prisoners were colored, while the population 
percentage of blacks was only a fraction over 2 
per cent. In Chicago nearly 10 per cent of the 
arrests in the years 1890-94 were of colored 
persons, while only 1 1-3 per cent of the pop- 



ulation were such. Conditions of life and bad 
social opportunities cannot be urged in excuse. 
In Chicago the conditions of life for Italians, 
Poles, and Russians are fully as bad as for the 
blacks, but their criminality is much less. The 
difference is racial. 

Where are the happy results of the schools ? 
The church membership and school attend- 
ance of the blacks constantly increase ; but 
" in the statistics of crime and the data of ille- 
gitimacy the proof is furnished that neither 
religion nor education has influenced to an 
appreciable degree the moral progress of the 
race." In Jamaica the illiteracy of the negroes 
has rapidly decreased since "the year 1861 ; 
but Mr. Smeeton in his official report says : 
"An ever - increasing educational force has 
been ... in operation without apparently any 
cleansing away of this social cancer " (illegiti- 
macy). 

Economically, the free negro is not a good 
laborer. Supervision is necessary to secure 
adequate service. Doubtful benefit accrues to 
any community from negro ownership of land ; 
as a farmer, the negro is usually too shiftless 
to try for more than a bare livelihood. After 
as complete a study as the material at hand 
permits, of the negro as laborer, tradesman, 
capitalist, Mr. Hoffman says : "It is not too 
much to say that if the present tendency toward 
a lower degree of economic efficiency is per- 
sisted in, the day is not far distant when the 
negro laborer of the South will be gradually 
supplanted by the immigrant laborer from Eu- 
rope." 

What can be done ? Not much. But faith 
in school-book education as a means of grace 
must die. The negro must be taught that hon- 
esty and purity are necessary ; that continued 
industry is the price of life. Less petting and 
more disciplining is needed ; fewer academies 
and more work-benches. Recognition of differ- 
ence between white men and black men is fun- 
damental. The desire and effort to turn bright 
black boys into inefficient white men should 
cease. It is imperative that we demand hon- 
esty toward the negro and decency from him. 
But we may expect the race here to die and 
disappear ; the sooner perhaps the better. If 
the race is capable of adjustment to American 
surroundings, time will solve the difficulty 
kindly ; if it is not, time will still solve the 
difficulty but severely.

Everyone who has been in Rome knows the little

and has heard the legend by which its name is ac-

name for the title of his new romance, the great 
Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz has indicated, 
without any further ceremony being needed, that his 
work is a study of Roman life in the days of the 
early Christians. More specifically, it is a romance 
of the reign of Nero, and deals, for the most part, 
with the events of the fateful year 64, the year of 
the Great Fire and the first persecution. It is un-

deniable that the suggestion of this theme makes an 
unpleasant impression. We at once call to mind the 
mawkishly sentimental twaddle of a long series of 
books by well-meaning but ill- equipped evangelical 
writers, whose tracts in the guise of historical fiction 
have done their worst to pervert the splendid possi- 
bilities of the subject of early Christianity. The 
atrocious taste and the historical recklessness of 
such books as Dean Farrar, for example, has devoted 
to this subject make the reader hesitate about hav- 
ing anything to do with it. Let us say at once, then, 
that Mr. Sienkiewicz writes from the standpoint of 
the historian of culture who is at the same time an 
artist, and not from the standpoint of the sectary or 
the apologetic tractarian. " Marius the Epicurean " 
is not farther removed in spirit from the Dean 
Farrar sort of book than is " Quo Vadis." And we 
may register the impression, en passant, that the 
Polish novelist may have read Pater's classic and 
been influenced by it, although the aims of the two 
writers are as unlike as possible, the greatest imag- 
inable contrast existing between the delicately philo- 
sophical method of the one and the concrete, vivid, 
and robust treatment of the other. Having thus 
sought to remove a prejudice that might deprive 
"Quo Vadis" of some of the readers it ought to 
have, we do not hesitate to declare this work one of 
the greatest historical novels ever written. As a 
romance of the world of classical antiquity its posi- 
tion is almost unique. In seeking for works with 
which to compare it, we naturally bring to mind 
two classes of books, the one represented by " Hy- 
patia " and " The Last Days of Pompeii," the other 
by such products of the German school as the class- 
ical novels of Herren Ebers, Hamerling, and Dahn. 
Now, the books of the former class, fascinating as 
they are, suffer from their lack of historical insight 
and their burden of rhetoric ; while the bookg of the 
latter class, although written from fulness of knowl- 
edge, are so devoid of dramatic and literary inspira- 
tion, so mechanical in their structure and action, 
that they are not easily readable at their best, and 
at their worst, are appalling examples of everything 
that works of fiction should not be. It is the dis- 
tinction of " Quo Vadis " to embody the best qual- 
ities of both these classes of novels, and to be rela- 
tively free from their defects. The author has so 
worked himself into the life of the Neronian period 
that he can make us see it from the inside ; his 
knowledge of Roman history and literature is so 
ample and so thoroughly assimilated that he is 
able to invest this romance of antiquity with the 
same semblance of reality that he has thrown about 
his magnificent trilogy of the epic age of Polish 
national history. The historical figures of Nero, of 
Petronius (who is in many ways the leading char- 
acter, and whose presentation is a masterpiece of 
delineative art), of Peter, and of Paul of Tarsus, 
are drawn with force and insight ; the fictitious 
figures of the lovers the patrician Vinicius and 
the Christian maiden Lygia are creations of gen- 
uine vitality ; while the descriptions of Roman feasts

and Christian assemblies, of the Great Fire and the 
ghastly spectacle of the arena, are rich in coloring, 
and presented with a realism that even M. Zola 
could not easily have surpassed. In a word, the 
interest of the book, whether historical, descriptive, 
or imaginative, is absorbing, and does not flag from 
first to last. That anyone should have written such 
a book would be remarkable ; that it should have 
come from the author of the Polish trilogy and 
" Children of the Soil," and in such prompt succes- 
sion, is one of the most astonishing facts in recent 
literary history. 

A new novel by M. Cherbuliez is always some- 
thing of an event, and we are glad that " Apres 
Fortune Faite " has found early translation. The 
story is of an old Provencal, who has made an im- 
mense fortune in America (of course) returning to 
end his days in his native land. He builds a superb 
villa, and surrounds himself with all the nephews, 
neices, and other relatives that he can find. They 
prove to be a calculating and rapacious lot with 
one notable exception and their attentions to the 
multimillionaire are so evidently interested that he 
feels no compunctions of conscience about playing 
with their expectations much as a cat plays with a 
captive mouse. Although these parasites have a 
common greed, they are otherwise admirably differ- 
entiated, for M. Cherbuliez is a past master in the 
art of characterization, although he never maintains 
for any length of time the creative level. His fig- 
ures are all drawn from models, and the technique 
is almost perfect, but we rarely are conscious of the 
idealizing touch of genius. It must be admitted 
that, despite all its merits, " With Fortune Made " 
is an inferior production as measured by the author's 
own standard. Compared with the masterpiece 
that came immediately before it, "Le Secret du 
Precepteur," it shows a falling off in power. Still, 
it is a book to be grateful for in these days when 
French fiction is so given over to realism, and eroti- 
cism, and psychological analysis. It is a story in 
the old straightforward sense, and a story told with 
the skill of one of the most accomplished novelists 
that France has ever produced. M. Cherbuliez is 
very far from attaining the stature of a Balzac, for 
example, yet the predominant thought of his read- 
ers, when they have gone through the whole series 
of his novels, is the wish that they might have them 
to read over again, so great and varied and cheer- 
ful has been the entertainment provided. Whereas 
we may finish our perusal of the works of some far 
greater man with a sense of relief that the thing is 
done once for all, and without the slightest desire 
to repeat the experience, albeit we are conscious 
that we have gained a new and permanent mental 
possession. 

M. Paul Bourget does not fulfil the promise of 
his earlier writings. Equipped with a fruitful 
method, a remarkable fund of observation, and an 
unusual gift for delicate analysis, his first successful 
books seemed to indicate that he might " go far." 
But the books that followed, although more ambi- 



tious in scope, did not exhibit a corresponding 
increase in power, and we have come reluctantly to 
admit that his method, his observation, and his anal- 
ysis remain very much what they were at the out- 
set of his career. The method is rigid, the observa- 
tion has gained in quantity but not in quality, the 
analysis exhibits no new subtleties of development. 
These impressions are, we think, all borne out by 
" A Tragic Idyl," M. Bourget's newest novel, and 
we realize besides how narrow and how hopelessly 
artificial is the world in which his creations move. 
The types of character that provide the action of 
this story are uninteresting in themselves, and they 
have been given us with wearisome iteration by 
dozens of novelists before. It seems to us that M. 
Bourget always plays upon the surface of life, 
attracted by its mere glitter, and that his attempts 
to plumb the depths are pretences so obvious as to 
be sure of detection. But he has style, and style 
will cover a multitude of sins. His style suffers, of 
course, at the hands of translators, but has in the 
present instance escaped with less harm than usual. 

In style, also, must be sought whatever salvation 
there may be for the most conspicuous among the 
young Italian writers of the present day, for Signer 
d'Annunzio's novels have no other redeeming fea- 
ture. And since style is untranslatable we may say 
parenthetically that there is no excuse for putting 
his books before English readers. They deal with 
matters that are unpleasant to contemplate, and the 
quality of reticence is absolutely unknown to them. 
" The Triumph of Death," for example, just pub- 
lished in translation, is a book at once morbid and 
loathsome. It is not a presentation of life, but of 
the corruption that attends upon life, and seeks to 
make it impossible. The essential rottenness of the 
book condemns it, in spite of a certain brutal force 
and of two or three episodes that recall, in their 
treatment, the industrious cumulative methods of 
M. Zola, who is clearly the author's model. 

Some months ago, an editorial article in " The 
Nation " pictured in impressive terms the fate of 
the too-popular novelist. The benumbing effects of 
a premature success upon the development of bud- 
ding talent were set forth, and the several stages of 
the process of degradation were indicated. The 
lowest depths were reached when it became the 
writer's fate to be " syndicated " and invited to con- 
tribute to " The Ladies' Home Journal." This 
homily pointed the moral of many recent literary 
careers, and we cannot help calling it to mind after 
reading the latest novel by Dr. Conan Doyle. We 
are not sure that Dr. Doyle has written for the Bok 
capharn,atim, but there is no doubt that he has 
otherwise realized the conditions set forth by the 
moralist of " The Nation " and become a man so 
" syndicated " that there is small hope of his recov- 
ery by literature. " Rodney Stone," his latest novel, 
is a book which gets along without the motive of 
love by seeking for an adequate motive in the prize 
ring. Prize-fighting is the central theme, and most 
of the characters are either sluggers or their friends 



1897.]

and associates. Mr. George Meredith, it will be 
remembered, made a prize-fight a conspicuous epi- 
sode in " The Amazing Marriage," and even his 
admirers found it hard to forgive him for the amaz- 
ing breach of good taste. For the present writer, 
the extenuation of genius is hardly to be urged, and 
there is little to relieve the general condemnation 
that should fall to his glorification of the brute. 
The acceptable things about the book are its care- 
ful study of a typical English dandy of the begin- 
ning of the present century, and its clever pastiche 
of anecdote and reminiscence whereby something of 
the social atmosphere of the Napoleonic period is re- 
produced. For its occasional touches of a nobler 
national ideal than that of the pugilist the book shall 
not be dismissed without a word of qualified praise, 
but it is altogether unworthy of the pen that gave 
us " The White Company " and " Micah Clarke." 

Sir Walter Besant's new novel deals with one of 
the socialist communities of the State of New York. 
There are some indications that the author had in 
mind the community established by Thomas Lake 
Harris, and made almost famous by its capture of 
Laurence Oliphant, while in other respects we are 
reminded of the indigenous community of the 
Shakers, recently seized upon for purposes of fiction 
by Mr. Howells. Be this as it may, " The City of 
Refuge " is an ingeniously-planned and well-told 
story, with much romantic interest and a happy out- 
come. It is a very characteristic production, and 
displays the author's mannerisms his confidential 
tone, his expansiveness, and his curious trick of 
ringing verbal changes upon an idea in every 
chapter. 

In reading " Limitations," we are never for long 
allowed to forget that the author is also the author 
of " Dodo." Mr. Benson did not exactly introduce 
into our fiction the Dodo-trick of strained smart- 
ness, of overwrought epigram, and of preternat- 
urally brilliant dialogue, but he made more use of 
it than most writers have done, and it gave his 
first book a distinctive cachet. " Limitations " opens 
in a way strongly suggestive of " Dodo," although 
in this case the forced cleverness is attributed to a 
man and one grows impatient after several chap- 
ters have done almost nothing to develope the story. 
A story appears in time, however, and proves read- 
able enough, although its every element is of the 
most hackneyed sort. There is some fairly good 
shop-talk about art, some attractive description of 
Greek and English landscape, and some religious 
moralizing on the part of the hero that seems rather 
alien to his character and to the spirit of the work. 

Mr. H. G. Wells, the ingenious author of " The 
Time Machine " and " The Island of Dr. Moreau," 
has turned the bicycle to literary uses in his story, 
" The Wheels of Chance." He is sure of a public, 
for the book appears at the psychological moment, 
and the thousands of riders who have recently con- 
quered the " wheel " will take retrospective delight 
in comparing their own recent struggles with those 
of the hero of this " bicycling idyll." These strug- 



gles have their humorous aspect, as those who have 
passed through them know, and Mr. Wells has a 
peculiar gift for the expression of this sort of humor. 
His draper's assistant is not a hero of the romantic 
type, and it is something of an artistic triumph to 
have enlisted our sympathies so successfully in his 
behalf as the author has done. Even the heroine, 
albeit she wears bloomers (called " rationals " in the 
British dialect), and is a girl who wishes to live Her 
Own Life, turns out a winsome enough creature, 
and the risky situations offered by her escapade 
are handled with a delicacy which leaves no room 
for offence. The book makes unusually pleasant 
reading, and evinces a considerable literary talent. 
Its distinguishing features are its humor, its uncon- 
ventionality, its scientific tinge, and its mildly satir- 
ical flavor. 

The romance of imaginary history is a literary 
form that seems to find increasing favor. Mr. Louis 
Tracy has made a very readable book out of his idea 
of " The Final War " which is to inaugurate the 
era of world-wide peace and the rational arbitra- 
ment of international differences. The war which 
he has imagined breaks out in the spring of 1898, 
and its battlefields are scattered over a large part 
of the earth. France and Germany conspire for 
the overthrow of England and make a sudden attack 
upon her. Presently Russia joins in the unholy 
alliance, and England is made to fight single-handed 
against the three greatest of European powers until 
the United States throws its weight into the balance 
and makes the conditions more nearly even. The de- 
scent upon England is repulsed, and France and Ger- 
many in their turn take the defensive. The English 
occupy Havre and Stralsund, threatening Paris and 
Berlin. They also blow up the Suez Canal and hold 
the Straits of Gibraltar, thus making of the Med- 
iterranean a lake within which a large part of the 
French fleet is confined. Russia is defeated at sea by 
an American fleet under Captain Mahan, and suffers 
disaster on the Indian frontier. Finally, the Saxon 
race triumphs everywhere, and forces a general 
European disarmament. There is so much fighting 
in the book that it grows tedious after a while, but 
the author achieves a certain emotional effect, and 
readers who believe that the future of civilization 
is bound up in the destinies of the Saxon will not 
escape an occasional thrill, in spite of the author's 
somewhat vainglorious manner, the unreality of his 
characterizations, and the inelegance, or worse, of 
his English. 

Mr. Allen Upward's new romance of imaginary 
history is woven about the career of the late King 
of Bavaria builder of castles and Maecenas of the 
arts. The author begs us not to carry the com- 
parison too far, and we cheerfully admit that his 
sketches of the brilliant monarch and his great 
composer-friend are made with a free hand. Mr. 
Upward's theme is that of the king eager to work 
for the good of his subjects, but so hedged about by 
ministers and prejudices and observances as to be 
unable to accomplish anything. This book, as well

as the " Majesty " of Heer Couperus and other 
books of the class, derives very distinctly from Herr 
BjOrnson's " Kongen," which set forth once for all 
the whole tragedy of the situation here involved. 
Mr. Upward's story gives but a feeble reflection of 
the power of its famous prototype. 

The " higher politics " of the Balkan Peninsula 
has furnished Mr. Sydney C. Grier with a theme 
for one of the best romances of imaginary history 
that it has been our good fortune to read of recent 
years. " An Uncrowned King " is not a roman h 
clef in any strict sense, but it has admirably seized 
the spirit of the political situation in Southeastern 
Europe, of the uncertain aims of the struggling Bal- 
kan nationalities, of Russian intrigue and nominal 
Turkish suzerainty. An English nobleman is the 
hero of the story. He is offered a crown and accepts 
it, but his coronation is delayed by an inopportune 
conflagration which destroys the sacred edifice in 
which alone the Kings of Thracia may legally be 
crowned. Meanwhile Scythian (that is, Russian) plots 
are hatched all about the still vacant throne, the 
pretender governs for a while without reigning, and 
is finally swept away by a revolution. He proves to 
be a more opinionated ruler than was suspected by 
the astute politician who is responsible for his brief 
term of authority, and cares more for one Thracian 
maiden than for all the vain shows of royalty. He 
gets the maiden in the end, and loses the throne 
without a pang. The whole story is capitally put 
together, and is more than readable from beginning 
to end. 

Mr. Anthony Hope's new novel takes us to his 
own imaginary Kingdom of Zenda, and tells of the 
romantic adventures of the Princess Osra, a young 
woman so beautiful that her career was one long 
series of devastations. No one could behold her, it 
seems, without becoming hopelessly enamored of her 
charms, and she took a most wicked delight in break- 
ing the hearts of her admirers, sending them one 
after another to various kinds of deaths. Luckily, 
her own heart was made captive in the end, by an 
ingenius stratagem, and the story ends. This is 
fortunate, for it grows a bit tiresome, in spite of the 
author's many inventions, and the winsome quality 
of some of his ultra-romantic episodes. 

The number of historical romances produced of 
late, dealing with the English Civil War, is quite 
extraordinary, and, with now and then an excep- 
tion, they are as alike as the peas in a pod. There 
is always a young hero who girds on his sword at 
the outbreak of hostilities, and there is always a 
high-spirited maiden who treats him with more or 
less scorn at the outset to yield herself the more 
unreservedly in the sequel. The hero is usually a 
cavalier who contrives to save his neck after the 
overthrow of the royal cause. His adventures are 
always surprising, and include some act of personal 
devotion to the King and some sort of an interview 
with Cromwell. When we read these novels, we think 
of " Woodstock," and try not to make " odorous " 
comparisons. They are, as a rule, mildly exciting, 



and that is all. Two such books of the regulation 
type are before us, " Amyas Egerton, Cavalier," by 
Mr. M. H. Hervey, and " Mistress Spitfire," by 
Mr. J. S. Fletcher. The former has the Carisbrooke 
chapter in the royal tragedy for its chief feature ; 
the latter does not bring into particular prominence 
any important historical episode of the war, but is 
essentially private in its interest. In the latter, also, 
the hero is for once a Cromwellian, although the 
haughty damsel whom he woos is an ardent royalist. 
" Mistress Spitfire " is a very attractive book me- 
chanically, for it bears the imprint of the Messrs. 
Dent, and all book-lovers know what that means. 

" The Other House " is the most readable book 
that Mr. James has produced for some years a 
result following from the exigencies of its purpose 
rather than from any deliberate eschewing of his 
inconclusive aims and methods. The obvious thing 
about the book is its dramatic structure. It is a play 
in three acts ; the speakers are always conscious of 
being on the stage, and the reader is always con- 
scious that the connective tissue of the story the 
passages of description and analysis have for their 
sole purpose the production of those impressions 
that the playgoer gets through the medium of eye- 
sight. In other words, what we see as stage-setting 
and play of feature has somehow to be described in 
the book, and is described so skilfully as to keep the 
scene in all its details ever before the mental vision. 
In this aspect, the thing is so well done that adverse 
criticism is hardly possible. But the action of the 
story is not altogether natural, and the tragic climax 
finds us inadequately prepared. We realize from an 
early moment that the heroine is an emotional crea- 
ture, and we may guess at the depths of passion that 
lie beneath the surface of her nature, but for all that 
we are hardly prepared to find her guilty of so 
diabolical a thing as the deliberate murder of the 
child of the man whom she loves. This is the artistic 
flaw in the plot, transforming into crude melodrama 
what starts out to be a successful comedy of man- 
ners. 

Another two- volume novel by Mr. Marion Craw- 
ford attests the continued fertility of invention of 
that facile writer. It is the sort of story in which 
Mr. Crawford is always at his best, dealing, as it 
does, with Italian life and character. The narrative 
meanders smoothly along, with festina lente for its 
motto, and reaches an end when the hero has come 
to play a sufficiently important role to justify the 
use of his name for a title. We suspect that this 
novel is but the beginning of a series, and that we 
shall renew our acquaintance with Taquisara in the 
near future. We certainly hope to have this plea- 
sure, for his character is both strong and interesting, 
and capable of a development that the author has 
not seen fit to give it within the limits of the present 
work. 

In "A Matter of Temperament," Mr. E. Irenaeus 
Stevenson has given us a musical novel which is at 
the same time the presentation of a thesis. The 
book seeks to illustrate " the moral unstability of 



1897.]

the artistic temperament " and to suggest the pos- 
sible influence of music upon character. The result 
is a story interesting and even powerful, but a story 
which leaves the problem concerned very much as 
the author found it. For our part, we fully agree 
with Mr. Stevenson in ascribing an ethical influence 
to music (as to all other fine art), and are thus pre- 
disposed to accept whatever argument he has to offer. 
But to prove this point something more is needed 
than the embodiment of moral weakness in one or 
two characters who happen to be musicians. We 
miss the working out of cause and effect that ought 
to accompany such an effort as this, and we are by 
no means sure that the moral degradation of the 
hero would have been any less certain had he been 
a rank Philistine. The temperament of which this 
novel is chiefly a study seems to be a matter of 
essential character rather than a development in 
any way traceable to (although possibly accentuated 
by) the profession of its possessor. We are thus 
thrown back upon a consideration of the book as a 
mere piece of fiction, and in this aspect it proves to 
be a satisfactory piece of workmanship a story 
honestly conceived, held firmly in hand, and carried 
out without any affectation. 

"A Tame Surrender" is the title of Captain 
Charles King's latest novel. It is a story of the 
Chicago riots of 1894, and is made at the same time 
a quasi-military novel by the introduction of the 
Federal troops for the suppression of the disorder, 
and by the fact that the hero is an army officer. 
We are probably as yet too near to the exciting 
episodes of the summer of 1894 to view them in 
their proper perspective, and we think that Captain 
King has somewhat distorted the facts for the sake 
of literary effect. He also allows a little too much 
argument and discussion to creep into his story, and 
makes his irritation at the unfairness and brutality 
of Chicago journalism rather too much of a personal 
matter. But the story-telling instinct keeps him 
from going very far afield, and he succeeds in sus- 
taining a marked degree of interest, although we are 
never permitted to penetrate very far into the per- 
sonality of his characters. 

The amateurish quality is quite evident in " The 
Metropolitans," and is not altogether ungrateful, 
for this quality usually connotes freshness if not 
finish. The scene is divided between New York and 
Greenland, and the Arctic passages have all the de- 
lightful irresponsibility of a writer who has "read 
up " two or three popular books of travel and fan- 
cies that he knows all about the regions described. 
The metropolitan scenes are drawn from life (as 
tempered by a young woman's romantic fancy), and 
arouse more interest than the story of the Arctic 
exploring party. As for the Hungarian dancer, who 
follows the hero to Greenland, she is a pretty and 
pathetic, but hardly a possible figure. The exigen- 
cies of the plot make it necessary that she should 
die before the party returns, and the writer does 
not hesitate about the sacrifice. The old device of 
the letter that never came is pressed into service, 



not very skilfully, and the Greenland chapters fol- 
low as a consequence. The story is pleasantly told, 
and has the merit of a reasonably happy outcome. 

The Dutch-Indian story of " Gold " is almost 
totally destitute of constructive art, and presents its 
leading characters in an outline so blurred that they 
never seem real to us. There are some passages of 
pretty sentiment about the tale, and something of 
the confidential sort of moralizing that is charac- 
teristic of another writer of Dutch stories, " Maar- 
ten Maartens." The scene is laid for the most part 
in the Dutch Indies, and there is no lack of local 
color. The story of the quest for gold in the mys- 
terious kingdom of Moa is too confused to be satis- 
factory, and its use to point a moral is so evident 
that we cannot enjoy it as a narrative of pure ad- 
venture. 

The collections of short stories that have appeared 
during the past few weeks are so numerous that it 
is impossible even to mention, much less do justice 
to them. Among the half-dozen to which our space 
permits a few words to be given, Mr. Bret Harte's 
volume must of course take precedence. In this vol- 
ume there are eight stories of very unequal value, 
all but one dealing with the life of the mining-camp 
or the Spanish- American civilization of California. 
No one, as long as Mr. Harte is spared us, will have 
the hardihood to assert that the good stories are all 
told. He has a veritable cornucopia of them, and 
these latest offerings are almost as fresh as were the 
first-fruits of his inexhaustible fancy. And the 
amazing thing about it all is the fact that the author 
has for a quarter of a century seen little or nothing 
of the men and scenes that he depicts for us in so 
vivid a fashion. 

Long experience has taught us about what to ex- 
pect from a volume by Mr. Harte, but Mr. Cham- 
bers, the next author upon the list, has so agile an 
imagination that whatever a new book of his may 
turn out to be, it is not likely to resemble its pred- 
ecessors. " The Maker of Moons " is a tale of mys- 
tery in a manner quite the author's own ; while the 
six other tales that go with it, although they do not 
deal with the frankly impossible, are more or less 
fantastic in conception, and depend upon the unex- 
pected for their charm. There is little finish about 
these stories, but a good deal of animation. 

Miss Furman's " Stories of a Sanctified Town " 
are character sketches, to the number of a full dozen, 
from a small Kentucky community that has recently 
experienced the throes of a religious revival. They 
are written in a form of speech that is colloquial 
rather than dialectal, and offer no difficulties to the 
reader. Their humor is quiet and genuine, enter- 
taining enough for a time, but becoming monoto- 
nous in the end. 

There is no lack of variety in a sheaf of eight 
stories collectively entitled "A Mountain Woman," 
the work of Mrs. Elia W. Peattie. We are success- 
ively introduced to a series of typical figures, and 
each of them is portrayed with an amount of sym- 
pathetic insight that may fairly be called remark-

able. Among the figures in this gallery that make 
the deepest impression are those of the superb crea- 
ture who dominates the titular story, of Jim Lancy 
and his wife, who met their Waterloo on a mort- 
gaged Nebraska farm, and gave up the unequal 
struggle for subsistence after heroic efforts to get 
the better of fate, of a released convict who finds 
the woman of his love waiting for him after twenty 
dreary years of imprisonment, of the devoted ser- 
vant of God, Father de Smet, of a miner who has 
" made his pile " in fifteen years " up the gulch," 
and has kept his soul alive during the process, and 
of " a lady of yesterday " whose story, or what little 
of it is told us, remains a tender and fragrant rec- 
ollection. These stories are carefully finished work, 
and possess the quality of poetic pathos in quite 
unusual degree. In the distinction of their manner, 
as well as in their choice of scene, they suggest the 
work of Mrs. Mary Hallock Foote, and do not suf- 
fer in the comparison. 

" The Lucky Number " is a volume of slum stories. 
This is not a very thrilling announcement, for slum 
stories are usually vox (in the form of illiterate dia- 
logue) et prceterea nihil. But Mr. Friedman, 
although he is bound to make some use of the 
speech of the gutter and the dive, does not make 
that jargon the raison d'etre of his book, and shows 
in many passages that he can command good liter- 
ary English. His stories are mostly very brief, and 
one or two of them are too painful for legitimate 
fiction, but the better ones are vital in their concep- 
tion, and all are carefully elaborated. No beginner 
need be ashamed of " A Fair Exchange " and 
" Aaron Pivansky's Picture," the longest as well as 
the best stories in the collection. The sketches are 
realistic, but in a good sense, for they have a back- 
ground of the culture that comes from good read- 
ing and careful reflection. 

Another volume of very short stories comes to 
us from Mr. William Allen White, a Kansas jour- 
nalist. They are truthful studies of Kansas life, 
with occasional touches of humor and a heavy bur- 
den of pathos. The general effect is almost as 
sombre as that produced by Mr. Howe's " Story of 
a Country Town " published some years ago, and 
in these tales of a drought-stricken region we find it 
difficult to recognize the " God's own country " of 
which Mr. R. M. Field has written so charmingly. 
But, as Mr. White reminds us, " Kansas is divided 
into three parts, differing as widely, each from the 
other, as any three countries in the same latitude on 
the globe." The sketches in this book are mainly 
of Western Kansas, " the only place where there is 
any suffering from drought or crop failures, a new 
country old only in a pluck which is slowly conquer- 
ing the desert." WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

illustrated Flora supplies a long -felt want, and the 
of the United siates. p nrase h as g ro wn so commonplace 

that we hesitate to use it. But we cannot escape 
from using it in the case of a volume now before us, 
so literal is the application, and so deeply-felt has 
been the want. The volume in question is the first 
of three to which the completed work will extend, 
and the title is as follows : "An Illustrated Flora of 
the Northern United States, Canada, and the Brit- 
ish Possessions " (Scribner). The authors are Judge 
Addison Brown and Professor Nathaniel Lord Brit- 
ton, and the preparation has taken about six years. 
The entire work is ready for the press, and the sec- 
ond and third volumes may be expected without 
delay. This is the first complete illustrated " Flora " 
published in the United States. It includes all 
species, from the ferns upward, growing wild in 
the area which includes the continent from the 
Atlantic to the 102d Meridian, and from the par- 
allel of the southern boundary of Virginia and Ken- 
tucky to the northern limits of Labrador and Man- 
itoba. The number of species described and figured 
is over four thousand, scarcely one thousand of 
which have ever been figured before. The illustra- 
tions are simple cuts, reduced in scale as little as 
possible, and including all essential features, with 
enlargements of special parts. Three species to a 
page is the rule, except where the space is partly 
taken up by analytical keys and descriptions of 
groups. We have examined rather closely the fig- 
ures given for a hundred or more species particu- 
larly familiar to us, and have only admiration for 
the success with which the typical characteristics 
have been reproduced. The classification used fol- 
lows the best modern authorities, adopting for the 
most part the arrangement of Engler and Prantl. 
The systematic order of groups is strictly in accord- 
ance with the principles of evolution, and students 
familiar with the older books, such as Gray's " Man- 
ual," will rub their eyes at the rearrangements made 
necessary by the investigations of recent years. In 
consequence of this plan, the present volume begins 
with the ferns and their allies, then takes up the gym- 
nosperms, the monocotyledonous angiosperms, and 
the " first families " of the dicotyledones. The Com- 
positae, as representing the most highly developed 
form of floral structure, will not appear until the 
close of the third volume. In nomenclature, a thor- 
ough revision has been made, following the rule of 
priority. This restores a good many old names, and 
clears away a great number of ill-considered later 
ones. English common names are given as far as 
possible, although the majority of these are any- 
thing but common in the sense of being generally 
familiar. We are much inclined to doubt the de- 
sirability of inserting such English names as "river- 
bank willow " (for Salixfluviatilis),vf\i\ch are noth- 
ing more than translations of the Latin names.

Names of this sort are almost never found in gen- 
eral use. In the matter of capitalization, the authors 
have heen, we think, well-advised in using capitals 
for " specific or varietal names derived from persons 
and places, or used as the genitive of generic namea 
or as substantives." This is the ordinary literary 
usage, and the arguments for it are much stronger 
than those against it. We have now summarized 
the leading features of this important work, and 
little more remains to he said. The work is so well 
done that it seems almost beyond criticism, except 
in matters too minute for consideration here. Every 
student of plant-life, and particularly every teacher 
of botany, will find it simply indispensable. 

The life of the painter Millet was 

written vears a g> or P artlv written, 
by his friend Alfred Sensier ; but the 
book has long been out of print, and is chiefly known 
to English readers through the abridged translation 
which appeared in " Scribner's Magazine," and was 
reprinted later by the Macmillan Co. Since M. 
Sensier wrote, a vast amount of information as to 
Millet has come to light, called forth mainly by his 
prodigious if belated vogue as a painter, and con- 
sisting largely of the personal recollections of those 
who knew him in life. A new biography has thus 
become indispensable ; and the task of writing it has 
happily fallen into the diligent and sympathetic 
hands of Mrs. Henry Ady (" Julia Cartwright "), 
whose "Jean Frangois Millet, his Life and Letters " 
is just issued in rather sumptuous form by the 
Macmillan Co. Millet's life-story is a pathetic one 
enough the too common one of great gifts unap- 
preciated, of masterpieces frowned down by acad- 
emic prejudice and pedantry, of pearls cast before 
the unregarding multitude, of inspired works, des- 
tined in time to fetch their thousands and adorn the 
walls of national galleries, hawked about for a pit- 
tance in order that the painter's little ones might 
have a mouthful of bread. Truly Millet belongs to 
the " great company of sorrow." Yet he tasted at 
last a tardy triumph saw fickle Paris crowding to 
view his once-despised canvases, and heard the 
chorus of praise raised by critics who had long de- 
nounced him as a charlatan, as a vulgar painter of 
boors, of cretins, of savages, even as a demagogue of 
the most dangerous type. Honor followed honor; 
and when the " great peasant " was dead, a statue of 
him was raised on the market-place at Cherburg, 
where he may now be seen, graved in imperishable 
bronze, gazing out over the seas and the coast he loved 
so well. " So the cripple Justice," wrote M. Andre 
Michel, " hobbling along on her crutches, arrives at 
last, and with a mournful smile lays her crown on 
the brows of the dead." Millet's personality was 
one of rare charm, and though a peasant by birth 
and early education, he was a man of culture. His 
letters are full of pregnant sentences, and indicate 
the literary instinct, the broad and generous view of 
life, and a poetic imagination of high order. His life 
is worth reading, and worth pondering ; and we trust 



Mrs. Ady's eloquent and matterful volume may find 
the favor it deserves. It is enriched by nine well- 
executed photogravures, comprising a portrait of 
Millet and eight of his principal works : " Le Sem- 
eur," "Les Glaneuses" ("The Angelas"), "La, 
Nuee de Corbeaux" "La Jeune Bergkre," "La 
Sortie" " Le Retour" and " Les Lavandieres." 
The plates well repi-esent the bent of the painter's 
genius. _ 



An excellent use ^ u ^ " Cambridge Historical 

short history Series" (Macmillan) takes another 

step towards completion with Justice 
William O'Connor Morris's "Ireland: 1494-1868." 
We cannot commend too highly the spirit in which 
this book is written. It is no easy task for an Irish- 
man writing the history of Ireland to assume a tone 
other than that of an impassioned advocate plead- 
ing her cause at the bar of nations. This pitfall 
Justice Morris has avoided ; and the fact will es- 
pecially commend his book to the American public 
now grown pardonably impatient of an appeal that 
for obvious reasons has unhappily come to ring not 
altogether true in its ears. The wail of the Hiber- 
nian patriot (once a magical " Open Sesame " to 
American hearts and purses) has lost much of its 
pristine pathos and potency in this land thanks 
to a class of peculiarly obnoxious adventurers who 
have long notoriously sounded it solely with a view 
to their own personal use and emolument. Justice 
Morris's book is, what it should be, a dispassionate 
yet earnest and rationally patriotic recital of the 
leading events of the internal history of Ireland 
during the period treated. Irish history is not de- 
void of dramatic passages and picturesque incidents 
that would have inspired the pen of a Froissart ; 
but it is not this side of it that is of most interest to 
the modern reader, who seeks history mainly as a 
key to existing conditions and issues ; nor is this 
the side of it upon which our author chiefly dwells. 
To tell the story of the growth of the Irish people, 
to unfold the circumstances under which it has ex- 
isted through many centuries and become what it is 
to-day, is his aim. We are acquainted with no other 
book of the scope and compass of Justice Morris's 
little manual which tells Ireland's pathetic and 
instructive story half so well, either in point of style 
or of matter ; and the book forms a striking exam- 
ple of the merits of the useful series to which it 
belongs. The Appendix contains a serviceable list 
of authorities, and there is a good folding-map of 
Ireland. _ _ 

We think it a difficulty in Mr. Bran- 
der Matthews's new volume of essays 
" Aspects of Fiction, and Other Ven- 
tures in Criticism " (Harper), that he is not serious 
enough. A man who was serious would not (so far 
as we can judge) think that Zola, Coppe'e, HaleVy, 
and Charles Dudley Warner are aspects of fiction, 
even when introduced and ended up by matters which 
might more properly be so called. Nor does it seem 
to us serious for a man of Mr. Matthews's position

to offer to the world " ventures in criticism." If he 
merely ventures, who is going to take hold boldly and 
confidently and really do the thing ? There are, of 
course, different kinds of seriousness, and the greater 
numher of them are very dull. We would not have 
Mr. Matthews suddenly become dull. But one may 
have a serious purpose and yet be entertaining. 
This book of essays is certainly entertaining ; judged 
as we judge magazine articles (from which the book 
is mainly made up) it is excellent, entertaining, 
well-put, sound, and what not else that it should be. 
But it says little that remains by one. It is made 
up of passing thoughts rather than lasting ideas. In 
other words, Mr. Matthews has not, on the whole, 
set himself to thinking about anything that is worth 
thinking about for any length of time, and so his 
book is no more than a contribution to the maga- 
zine literature so common nowadays. It is so easy 
now to write something, to get it printed, and 
(strangely enough) to get people to read it, that the 
temptation to do what is not worth doing is very 
strong. Of these thirteen essays, several are worthy 
a longer life than they have already had, but not a 
life much longer. There are some books a man of 
culture is foolish not to read. " Essays in Criti- 
cism " is one of them ; or, if we want something 
nearer home, let us say " Among my Books." They 
make some addition to our mental furniture. They 
remain with us or continually return to us. But one 
might read Mr. Matthews's book with great pleas- 
ure, and a week afterwards search his mind for some- 
thing therefrom resulting, and find but little. Now 
we should like to have someone in this country write 
a really fine volume of essays, a volume that would 
compel admiration ; and we think Mr. Matthews 
ought to feel it his duty to do so. He knows enough, 
for he is a professor of literature in one of our great 
Universities ; and that he is able to express himself, 
this volume bears witness. A certain dervish once 
addressed himself to a red-headed woodpecker, say- 
ing, " Instead of continually tapping at that tree in 
a way that annoys me, pray tear in pieces this oak 
which lies across the path I wish to travel." But 
the woodpecker continued to tap the tree ; for he 
not only liked better to do so, but had other reasons. 

The literature Mr. Carl A. Thimm's "Complete 
of Fencing Bibliography of Fencing and Duel- 

ling, as Practised by all European 
Nations from the Middle Ages to the Present Day " 
(John Lane) is an elaborate, handsomely equipped 
work, that betokens much painstaking research on 
the part of its author. In England the art and 
practice of fencing, long seemingly moribund, seems 
to have shown of late years unmistakable signs of 
revival. This revival, bringing with it an interest 
in the rather copious and generally unfamiliar liter- 
ature of the subject, has created a need for a work 
like the present one that is, for a systematic and 
fairly exhaustive guide or index to that literature. 
Whether or not such a guide is needed in this coun- 
try, we do not undertake to say ; but we have no 



doubt at all that Mr. Thimm's is by far the best one 
obtainable. Mr. Thimm is not without predeces- 
sors in his somewhat curious line of research, such 
men as Pallavicini in the seventeenth century, Kahn 
in the eighteenth, Roux and Possellier in the earlier 
part of the present one, having published bibliog- 
raphies of works touching the swordsman's art ; but 
these books contained at best but snippets of infor- 
mation on a very wide subject. Mr. Thimm's im- 
mediate predecessor is M. Vigeant, the Parisian 
maitre d'armes and litterateur, author of an ele- 
gant little book entitled " La Bibliographic de 1'Es- 
crime, Ancienne et Moderne." M. Vigeant's is a 
trustworthy account of French works, but it cannot 
compete with that of Mr. Thimm in point of gen- 
eral completeness. The latter bibliography is in- 
tended as a work of reference for all interested m 
fencing and duelling, bayonet exercise, etc., the 
author having accepted the definition that the sub- 
ject of fence embraces " all works relating to the art 
of offence and defence with all weapons held in the 
hands" that is, of all non-ballistic or non-projectile 
weapons, from foil to bayonet, and from dagger to 
battle-axe. The volume also enumerates all books 
and manuscripts relating to duelling, together with 
newspaper and magazine articles in point that have 
fallen under the author's observation. The volume 
is of considerable pictorial and quasi-pictorial inter- 
est, as it contains facsimile reproductions of rare 
title-pages, frontispieces, portraits of certain leading 
experts and masters ancient and modern, etc. There 
is also a well-executed portrait of the compiler. 

"The Epistolary Flirt" (Way & 
Williams) by Esmerie Amorie, is a 
work which will be found amusing, 
interesting, instructive, melancholy, trivial, revolt- 
ing (or several other things), according to the per- 
son who reads it. This is a sadly subjective opinion 
to give ; but when you consider that the book pre- 
sents, in a manner both witty and sufficiently true 
to nature, an illustration of that very characteristic 
feature of American life indicated in the title, you 
will see reason for it. With the subject-matter we 
are all familiar, and according as we feel more or 
less strongly about it, and according as our feeling 
for the subject-matter overrides our feeling about 
the book, so will we require one of the above pred- 
icates, or some other. Considered objectively, the 
book may be called, not epoch-making, but, like 
other works of genius, epoch-made. It is a con- 
fession d'une enfante du siecle, a book which in The 
History of Literature will need no date. It is a 
curious thing that America, " the paradise of those 
whom belated nations still call the weaker sex," 
should also be the country which offers the best 
specimens of this iridescent social beetle of flirta- 
tion. Whether such shallow pretence and mock 
excitement as is sternly portrayed by the present 
Juvenal is really worse in its effects than the demi- 
virginal state of things which, we are taught to be- 
lieve, exists in older and more putrescent civiliza-

tions, may be doubtful. Judged by itself, the book 
gives something of the impression of a pretty young 
girl who uses rouge. The inexperienced might doubt 
the existence of so sad a state of things as is here 
portrayed, were it not for a ring of sincerity in the 
pages. The author, maybe, is, or has been, like 
Bellair, who 

"By day deplored with Ghloe sage 

The follies of the passing age ; 

By night with Daphne at the ball 

Proceeded to commit them all." 

But whether our author writes from experience or 
from observation, we think the book will best be 
read to the accompaniment of reminiscence. And 
as this sauce can doubtless be furnished by the large 
majority of those who buy and read books, we have 
great confidence in commending the present work 
to a large audience. 

Mrs. Molineux's " Browning Phrase 
Book " (Houghton) is too incomplete 
to be satisfactory. It scarcely an- 
swers the purpose of a concordance, because it does 
not undertake to give all the passages in which any 
given word occurs ; it does not serve the uses of the 
student who wishes to locate notable or familiar 
passages, because the selections seem to have been 
made without reference to their quality ; its value 
is limited to readers who happen to use the " Riv- 
erside" or "Cambridge" editions of Browning, 
owing to its reference by pages to these editions and 
no others. Doubtless this last defect is unavoid- 
able, since there exists no text of Browning which 
is standard, like the "Globe" Shakespeare; but 
the other matters are less excusable. Why, for ex- 
ample, under the word " Pause " do we get so 
slightly significant a line from " The Ring and the 
Book" as "This recreative pause and breathing- 
while," and no mention of Pompilia's famous line 
from the same poem (and one so significant of 
Browning's habit of thought), "No work begun 
shall ever pause for death"? This is typical of 
dozens of similar cases ; in fact, after having had 
the book at hand for some time, and after frequent 
applications to it for aid in placing choice quotations, 
the result has been highly discouraging. It would 
have been better for the publishers to wait longer 
in the hope of a better book, and one that would 
spare the reader such frequent exasperation of a 
vain search. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Professor Peabody of Harvard has done a kind act in 
giving to the public his " Mornings in the College 
Chapel" (Houghton). The addresses are swift arrows 
for the %ing moments of a crowded week day, and they 
are well aimed: sententious and epigrammatic, to help 
the memory bear away the message; artistic in form, as 
becomes the classic chapel of our venerable university; 
calm and serene in tone, to " quiet the fever and pain," 
and lead to reflection and reverence; solid, manly, and 
wholesome in substance ; catholic and sincerely Christian 



in teaching. Any religious instructor who wishes to 
catch the ear of eager youth in our busy age would do 
well to have this book by his side. 

A collection of " Modern Political Orations," edited 
by Mr. Leopold Wagner, has been published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. The examples are all English, and 
extend from Brougham and Macaulay to Mr. Morley 
and Mr. Gladstone. We note also the publication of a 
second volume of Professor J. A. Woodburn's new edi- 
tion of Johnston's " American Orations." This volume 
is devoted exclusively to the slavery controversy, and 
extends from Rufus King to Charles Sumner. 

" The Elementary Study of English " (Harper), by 
Dr. W. J. Rolfe, is an excellent little manual of " hints 
for teachers " in the lower grades of school work. It is 
designed to accompany and explain the several volumes 
of selected readings that have from time to time been 
edited by Dr. Rolfe. Thoroughly practical and sensible 
in its suggestions, this small book may be recommended 
without qualification. We have had of late a good deal 
of writing about the teaching of the higher English, but 
elementary work deserves its share of attention, and 
such books as this are of the most helpful sort. 

Two important scientific works for the art-student 
are issued by the Macmillan Co. The first is a hand- 
book of human anatomy, by Professor Arthur Thomson, 
lecturer on anatomy in the art training-school at South 
Kensington, England. It aims to give, in place of the 
usual systematic anatomy, a treatment of the parts of 
particular regions as these are related to the moulding 
of surface forms, with illustrations by anatomical plates 
and by photography. The art student thus gets pre- 
cisely that form of anatomical knowledge which he 
most needs, with the practical application of it to his 
work. The second work, " Studies in the Art Anatomy 
of Animals," by Mr. Ernest E. Thompson, is a some- 
what similar treatment of the lower animals, domestic 
and wild, including a section on the art- anatomy of 
birds. The work is in atlas fprm, with many full-page 
plates. The treatment of hair and fur, from the scien- 
tific as well as the artistic point of view, is a noticeable 
and novel feature. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have published the 
fourth and final volume of Mr. Moncure D. Conway's 
edition of " The Writings of Thomas Paine." " The 
Age of Reason," with many illustrative documents, is 
the chief work included in this volume, which also de- 
rives peculiar interest from the " General Introduction " 
of the editor, in which he embodies his latest discover- 
ies. He says in conclusion: " Here then close my labors 
on the history and the writings of the great Commoner 
of Mankind, founder of the Republic of the World, and 
emancipator of the human mind and heart, Thomas 
Paine." Mr. Conway is to be congratulated upon his 
successful rehabilitation of a great character in our na- 
tional life, and upon the untiring industry which has re- 
sulted in this noble edition of Paine's writings. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have reissued their edi- 
tion of " A History of France," by Victor Duruy. The 
translation is an abridgment of the French edition of 
1884, and is made by Mrs. M. Carey. Professor J. F. 
Jameson provides an " introductory notice " and a sup- 
plementary chapter bringing the history down to the 
present year. The work is one of the best of the shorter 
histories of France, and in its present two-volume form, 
abundantly illustrated, ought to prove acceptable to a 
great number of readers.

LITERARY NOTES. 



With the beginning of this year " The Open Court " 
becomes a monthly. The numbers will be about four 
times as large as formerly, and the price of subscription 
remains unchanged. 

" The Peasantry " (" Les Paysans ") is the latest vol- 
ume in the Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac. The 
translation is by Miss Ellen Marriage, and there is the 
usual introduction by Mr. Saintsbury. 

Mr. Edward Freiberger is engaged upon a " History 
of the Drama in Chicago " for the Dunlap Society of 
New York, and will be glad to receive play-bills, rem- 
iniscences, or other materials bearing upon the subject. 
His address is P. O. Box 308, Chicago. 

Four new volumes in the uniform edition of Mr. 
J. M. Barrie's writings are at hand. They contain " A 
Window in Thrums," " An Edinburgh Eleven," " The 
Little Minister," and the first half of " Sentimental 
Tommy." Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the pub- 
lishers. 

There have been many editions of Irving's "Alham- 
bra," but none prettier, we should say, than that now 
published by the Macmillan Co., with drawings by Mr. 
Joseph Pennell, and an introduction by Mrs. Pennell. 
The volume is of convenient size for handling, and mod- 
erate in cost. 

" English Essays," edited by Mr. J. H. Lobban, is a 
new volume in " The Warwick Library " (imported by 
Scribner). It includes the usual introduction, extend- 
ing to about sixty pages, and selections running from 
Bacon to Lamb, and comprising nearly fifty numbers, 
taken from seventeen writers. 

Mr. Arthur Waugh's extremely satisfactory edition 
of Johnson's " Lives of the Poets " (imported by Scrib- 
ner) is brought to a conclusion with the sixth volume, 
just published. There is a very full index. The merits 
of this edition are found in its unobtrusive notes, its 
series of portraits, and the convenient size of its volumes. 

" The Pilgrim's Progress," printed on India paper at 
the Oxford Press, and brought thereby into the com- 
pass of a diminutive volume about two inches square, is 
a marvel of compactness, and a fitting companion to the 
"Imitation," published last year in the same form. 
The booklet is half an inch thick, and contains nearly 
nine hundred pages. 

Volume III. of the " Old South Leaflets," comprising 
twenty-five numbers, has just been sent out by the Di- 
rectors of the Old South Work. Among the more im- 
portant of these leaflets are " The Monroe Doctrine," 
" Hamilton's Report on the Coinage," and the group 
relating to Cromwell, Pym, Vane, Eliot, and other lead- 
ers of the movement against the Stuart tyranny. 

The Macmillan Company publish " The Kings," ed- 
ited by Mr. R. G. Moulton, in " The Modern Reader's 
Bible," and two volumes of a new and pretty series of 
" Temple Classics." Southey's " Nelson " and Words- 
worth's " Prelude " are the two classics chosen to begin 
this series, and Mr. Israel Gollancz is the editor, as he 
was of the " Temple" Shakespeare so recently completed. 

" Americana-Germanica " is the title of a new quar- 
terly review which comes from the University of Penn- 
sylvania, and is edited by Professor M. D. Learned, with 
the collaboration of many well-known Germanic scholars. 
Its scope comprises the literary, linguistic, and cultural 
relations of Germany and America, as well as Germanic 
studies in general. At first thought, one may doubt the 



existence of the field for a review of this magnitude, but 
an examination of the contents of this critical number 
will go far to dispel such a doubt, and to give the 
editors cause for congratulation. Literary studies of 
" Charles Sealsfield " and Freiligrath, a philological 
paper or two, and some good reviews make up the con- 
tents. The articles are written in English and German. 

Three years ago Mr. James Rhoades published the 
first half of a new translation of the " JSneid." The 
second part of the work, comprising Books VII. to 
XII., is now at hand, and the poem is complete. Mr. 
Rhoades has produced a good but not a great blank 
verse translation of the famous epic one that reads 
smoothly, has no little poetic fire, and commands 
respect. 

One of the handsomest private editions ever produced 
in this country has just been issued from the University 
Press of Cambridge " The Merchant Prince of Corn- 
ville, a Comedy," by Mr. Samuel Eberly Gross of 
Chicago. The play is one in which an original and 
rather interesting type is brought upon the stage in the 
titular character, and the development of his traits and 
eccentricities affords opportunity for some novel and 
amusing situations. The work is, in its present form, 
presumably intended as a " reading play " rather than 
one for the stage, and is modestly put forward by the 
author as having been written as a diversion from the 
pursuits of business, and intended for private distribu- 
tion only. 

Among the new features of " The Academy," in its 
rejuvenated form, is an original method of reviewing 
books for boys. The reviewer pretends to be a boy him- 
self, and discourses after such fashion as this: " Harold 
the Norseman ' is simply a ripping story about Harold 
Haardraada, King of Norway, who was bowled out at 
last by the other Harold at the battle of Stamford 
Bridge with Tostig, who was a bit of a bounder. The 
story is just as good as history because the writer has 
taken it from the old poet Johnnies [Our esteemed 
correspondent means, we have reason to believe, that 
the author has drawn his material from the old Norse 

Sagas, and we endorse his encomium ED.] This 

book tells you all about the Vikings, how they lived 
and hunted and fought; and you feel that it is all real, 
because the writer has taken it all from the chaps who 
saw it done. The story of how Harold scored off that 
rotten Emperor at Constantinople is awfully exciting, 
but indeed the whole story is good from beginning to 
end." 

The appearance in bound form of the fifth volume of 
the " Land of Sunshine " evidences the substantial prog- 
ress which this bright magazine is making, and gives us 
opportunity to repeat our previous commendations of it 
as one of the two best periodicals published on the Pa- 
cific Coast. San Francisco has in " The Argonaut " one 
of the strongest and most interesting weekly papers in 
the United States; and Los Angeles, the metropolis of 
Southern California, has in the " Land of Sunshine " a 
magazine wholly unlike any other published anywhere, 
charming in appearance and entertaining in contents, 
which affords one of the best evidences of the growth of 
enterprise and culture the place has been able to pre- 
sent. The editor, Mr. Charles F. Lummis, is an au- 
thority on the life and antiquities of the Southwest, and 
his graphic articles are an important feature of the 
magazine; while his editorial notes, though a little free 
and breezy, have a tone and manner that renders them 
unlikely to be overlooked by the most casual reader.

THE BOOK-WORM. 

To heroes who on battle-fields win fame 
We do not grudge the lordly lion's name; 
Those who, insensible to others' cares, 
Are always rough and surly, we call bears; 
And those who learn no lesson from what passes 
The ever dull and stupid, we call asses. 
All claim to be a lion I resign, 
And shun all bearish traits and asinine; 
Nature has cast me for another part, 
And I embrace my lot with all my heart; 
To satisfy an ever-craving need, 
All day upon the leaves of books I feed, 
And then by night I find a resting-place 
In what by day appeared of books a case; 
Thus day and night I think my title firm 
To be that busy idler a book-worm.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 1897. 



"JUST AS GOOD AS NEW." 



"AT YOUR OWN PRICE." 



GREAT SPECIAL OFFER. 

In making an inventory at the close of our recent Introductory Distribution, we find in stock a few sets of 
THE ENCYCLOPAEDIC DICTIONARY (in cloth and half Russia bindings) of which the sides only are 
slightly marred, not enough to impair their real value or appearance in your library, but sufficient to prevent 
their shipment as perfect stock at our regular prices of $42 to $70 a set. There being only a limited number 
of these sets, we shall not go to the trouble of rebinding them, but have decided to let them go on easy pay- 
ments of $1 down and $1 per month until paid for a little more than half our very low introductory price. 
BY PROMPT ACTION NOW, therefore, a number of ambitious and deserving readers of THE DIAL, who 
desire an up-to-date reference library, may now secure these special SETS AT ABOUT COST OF MAKING. 

Four massive volumes. Weight about 40 pounds. 50,000 Encyclopaedic Topics. 250,000 words defined. 
About 5000 Royal Quarto Pages. Cost $750,000 to produce. At once a Dictionary and an Encyclopaedia. 

WHILE THEY LAST they are yours for a lifetime this easy way: 

ONE DOLLAR DOWN AND A ffi N D T H LLAR 

WE GUARANTEE that these volumes, except for slight rubs or abrasions on the sides, are precisely the 
same as those sold at full prices; yet we cannot offer them as perfect stock, and our loss shall be your gain. 
This is positively the Greatest Bargain ever offered in a strictly high-class standard publication. It can never 
be duplicated under any circumstances whatsoever. For those persons who are trying to " get along " with 
older and inferior reference works, this is a really wonderful opportunity. 



What the Encyclopaedic Dictionary Is. 

It contains over 250,000 DEFINED WORDS nearly 
twice as many as the largest "unabridged " and is now 
accepted as AN UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY where- 
over the English language is spoken. 

IT IS ONE OP THE BEST OF ALL ENCYLOP^- 
DIAS, containing 50,000 encyclopaedic subjects ; the Brit- 
annica has only 27,000. JUST THINK OF IT ! The whole 
range of human knowledge condensed for your INSTANT 
USE by such world-famous scientists as Huxley, Proctor, 
and a hundred other educators of hardly less renown ! It 
easily takes the place of any half-dozen other reference books 
that could be named. It is truly a FAMILY NECESSITY. 

IT IS AN ORNAMENT TO ANY LIBRARY ; beau- 
tifully printed and substantially bound ; four great volumes, 
profusely illustrated, COSTING MORE THAN $750,000 
TO PRODUCE, and never before offered (except during 
our recent introductory sale) for less than $42 to $70 a set. 



What the Ablest Critics Say. 

" The Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a library condensed into 
four volumes ; a ton of diffusiveness reduced to forty pounds 
of quintessence." Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, March 
9, 1896. 

" It forms in itself a library for the busy man of affairs, 
the mechanic ambitious to advance himself in his line, or the 
student or apprentice just making a beginning." Scientific 
American, August 3, 1896. 

' ' For general use it has no superior. Of great professional 
value to clergymen, physicians, and lawyers." Ex- Judge

HOW TO SECURE THIS GREAT BARGAIN. 

Bring or send $1 to the Western Newspaper Syndicate, 269 Dearborn St., Chicago, and the entire set of four superb 
volumes, bound in cloth, will be forwarded. The balance is to be paid at the rate of $L monthly for one year. THE FIRST 
PAYMENT for either binding is ONLY $1. In sending your first payment please designate the style of binding you 
desire, and indicate how you wish the volumes sent, as the delivery charges must be paid by the purchaser. Remittances 
received after this special lot is exhausted will be immediately returned. The limited stock at our disposal cannot last 
long. To protect ourselves against book dealers, etc., we must decline to send more than 2 SETS to any one party, and in 
every case we must require the full name and address of each person receiving a set. We have only two styles of binding 
in this lot cloth and half-Russia about an equal quantity of each. ORDER AT ONCE, TO MAKE SURE. The 
absolute confidence of the syndicate that the work will be thoroughly appreciated, highly valued, and cheerfully paid for, 
is clearly shown by sending such a valuable set of books, the subscription price of which is from $42 to $70, on an advance 
payment of only $1. We refer to any newspaper in Chicago. 

The Half-Russia Binding will be supplied for 25 cts. additional per month. 

These are as good for all practical purposes and will look as well in your bookcase as those for which 
we are getting regular prices. We guarantee that the interiors and backs are not injured, and the 
bindings of our standard grade. The most serious injury to any set is no greater than might occur in a few days' use in 
your own home or office. As absolute proof of this statement you may retain the set for careful examination for one whole 
week. If not entirely satisfactory you may return to the Syndicate, and money will be promptly and cheerfully refunded. 
THIS IS POSITIVELY THE CHANCE OF A LIFE -TIME.

NEW BOOKS BY JAMES M. BARRIE. 

Two notable books from the pen of Mr. TSarrie were published during the fall, 
each of them unique in quality and character. The first of these, " Sentimental 
Tommy," was the success of the year during its serial publication, and its imme- 
diate success in book form confirms the judgment of its first readers that it is 
one of the genuine masterpieces of modern fiftion. The other book, " {Margaret 
Ogilvy," possesses an equal interest, though of an altogether different kind. It is 
an affectionate and exquisitely delicate sketch of Mr. TSarm's mother, which is 
necessarily also a sketch of his own life and surroundings, as well as bis work 
in its manner a sort of true " Window in Thrums."

MARGARET OGILVY.

" A book which it is almost sacrilegious to criticise. Yet 
just because it is inaccessible to ordinary comment, it is easy 
to place the volume, as it stands unmatched in literature as 
an idyl of the divinest of human feelings a mother's love. 
This is Mr. Barrie's finest, noblest book." British Weekly. 

" ' Margaret Ogilvy ' can never lose its mastery over the 
tears and smiles of future generations. It is a masterpiece 
of humor and pathos." New York Herald.

" A work of fiction that is as original as it is fascinat-

thereof." JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS. 

" Those who know a piece of life when they find it, and 
who care for the ultimate charm of a bit of pure literature,

WILLIAM PENN'S PLAN FOR 

The United States of Europe. 

In 1693, one hundred years before Kant wrote his " Eternal 
Peace," William Penn published a remarkable "Essay towards 
the Present and Future Peace of Europe," proposing a general 
union of the nations of Europe, with a federal parliament, as 
the only sure means of peace. This great essay, almost for- 
gotten, is now added to Old South Leaflets, being No. 75 in 
the series. The interest in international arbitration and peace 
is so great that this essay should be read everywhere. 

Price, 5 cents a copy, $4 per 100. Three bound volumes of 
the Leaflets are now ready, price $1.50 each. Send for com- 
plete lists.

"JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN." 

In these days of the excessive production of 
carelessly-written books, when the writer who 
has attained any degree of popularity does his 
work under the pressure of syndicates and pub- 
lishers' contracts, caring more for his income 
than for his fame, it is satisfying to think that 
there is at least one man, and that man one of 
the greatest spirits of his generation, who sets 
finish and elaboration above all other things, 
and who puts forth no book in which every 
phrase and every word has not been tried as by 
fire. We are told by his biographer that Dr. 
Ibsen does not set pen to paper until he has 
thought out the material for his work, and made 
it the subject of long and careful meditation. 
Having done this, " he makes a rough sketch 
of it, which he then proceeds to shape." But 
this sketch is merely preliminary. " Not until 
it is completed does he begin to feel acquainted 
with his characters, to know their dispositions, 
and to feel sure of the manner in which they 
will express themselves. So this first manu- 
script is worked over into a second, and from 
the second a third is carefully written out." By 
these laborious methods, practised four hours a 
day all the year round, the dramatist completes 
a play once in two years, and presents it to the 
public at Christmastide. It is a small matter 
as far as volume is concerned only some two 
hundred pages of loosely-printed dialogue 
but every word of it tells, and the reader knows 
that, however successful he may be in skim- 
ming the contents of other books, he cannot 
hope to understand this book by any such pro- 
cess, but must linger over every line until its 
full force has penetrated the consciousness. 

In " John Gabriel Borkman," as in most of 
the dramatist's works, there are two plays 
the one whose action is worked out before us, 
and the antecedent play of which the other is 
the consequence. It is a commonplace of crit- 
icism to say that this implied antecedent action, 
in the case of one of Dr. Ibsen's dramas, is the 
very stuff out of which a conventional drama- 
tist would construct the play that he wished to 
set before his audience. At all events, it must 
be explained as a preliminary to any intelli- 
gible statement of the action that we find in the 



38 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



book. Many years before the real play opens, 
then, John Gabriel Borkman was the head of 
a banking establishment. He was an ambi- 
tious man, and had conceived a vast plan for 
the exploitation of the mineral resources of his 
country. His aims were more than personal, 
for they looked to an industrial development 
that promised to better the lot of thousands 
besides himself. In the furtherance of this 
plan, he was tempted to a reckless use of the 
funds in his custody. The cooperation of a 
business associate named Hinkel became an 
absolute necessity, but had to be purchased at 
a great price. Both Hinkel and Borkman 
loved a woman, Ella Rentheim, who for her 
part loved Borkman. The latter paid the price 
demanded, ceased his attentions to the woman, 
and instead married her twin-sister Gunhild. 
Hinkel, however, found that he had not bought 
the love he sought, although Borkman had sac- 
rificed it, and learned to his chagrin that Ella 
remained faithful to the man who had given 
her up. He revenged himself by exposing 
Borkman's dealings, thus bringing about a 
criminal prosecution, the collapse of Borkman's 
schemes, and the ruin of those who had trusted 
in the bank. To this general ruin, however, 
there was one exception in the case of Ella 
lientheim, whose securities had remained un- 
touched. The prosecution led to Borkman's 
conviction, and he was sentenced to five years 
of imprisonment. Meanwhile, Ella had placed 
a house and the means of support in the hands 
of her sister, who, with her son Erhart, was 
left otherwise destitute. To this house Bork- 
man returned after his release from prison, but 
held no communication with his wife, who could 
not forgive him for the disgrace brought upon 
the family name. For eight years the family 
lived in this strange relation, she occupying 
the lower apartment and he the upper. During 
all this time the sister had seen neither of them, 
but had obtained custody of Erhart for several 
years of his childhood, and become devotedly 
attached to him. When the real play begins, 
Erhart is twenty years of age, and is living 
again with his mother, but, like her, has no 
intercourse with the voluntary prisoner up- 
stairs. 

The first of the four acts into which the play 
falls takes us to Fru Borkman's apartment, and 
the dialogue reveals, point by point, most of 
the facts that have been stated above. A visit 
from Ella, breaking the long silence of years, 
affords the opportunity for these disclosures. 
In the long conversation between the sisters, 



their inmost nature is revealed ; both are pas- 
sionate, but the passion of the one has remained 
softened by her love for Borkman, while the 
passion of the other the wife has stiffened 
into the bitter pride of an unforgiving woman, 
and taken the form of an intense resolve that 
Erhart shall atone for his father's guilt, and 
once more raise to honor the family name. 
Deluded by this hope, the one thing to which 
she clings, the mother does not realize that 
Erhart has grown up to be a rather common- 
place, pleasure-loving youth, chafing under the 
responsibility that others would set upon his 
shoulders, swelling with a sense of the joy of 
life, and seeking distraction in the society of a 
young and beautiful widow, Fanny Wilton by 
name, who lives in a neighboring villa. All of 
these things the mother cannot understand ; 
but they are realized by the sister, whose 
attachment to Erhart is such that through it 
alone he learns what a mother's love really is. 
The sister, finding her health enfeebled, and 
knowing that she has not long to live, has re- 
solved to wrest Erhart from his sombre sur- 
roundings, if possible, and the purpose of the 
visit is to plead with the mother to give up her 
son and the " mission " to which she would 
devote his life. Failing in her entreaty, the 
sister says that she cannot live without sight of 
Erhart, and announces her determination to 
remain with him, since she may not take him 
away. During the whole of this long act, Bork- 
man does not appear, but we are ever conscious 
of his presence, for his footsteps are heard 
overhead as he paces his apartment with the 
monotonous persistence of a caged lion. 

The second act transfers the scene to Bork- 
man's apartment, and opens with a long con- 
versation between Borkman and Foldal the 
latter a simple-minded man of humble position, 
a sufferer by Borkman's failure, who yet clings 
to his old acquaintance with a sort of dog- like 
fidelity. In this scene, and in the following 
scene with Ella, Borkman gives expression to 
his attitude toward those who have wronged 
him and been wronged by him ; toward his wife 
and the traitor Hinkel, toward the world of his 
creditors, and the woman whose love he sacri- 
ficed to his ambition. In these scenes, and in 
the scene with his wife in the third act, we find 
what may be taken as the central thesis of the 
play. As far as the world goes, Borkman is 
simply defiant. He has done wrong, and has 
atoned for it by suffering. He failed through 
treachery when within a hair's breadth of suc- 
cess. Others pass through such crises to fame

and honor ; he was luckless, and fell into the 
abyss when success was almost within his grasp. 
The crime of which the law took cognizance is 
not what weighs most heavily upon his soul, 
but the crime committed against himself and 
the woman he loved. As far as the former goes, 
he believes that he may yet regain his worldly 
position, but he learns that in the latter he has 
sinned past forgiving. We may translate a 
portion of the scene in which he states his own 
position. 

Ella Rentheim [with trembling voice, looking him in the 
face] . Can it be true, what you say, that I was dearest to you 
in the world ? 

Borkman. Both then and since, long, long thereafter. 

Ella Rentheim. And yet you bartered me away. Traded 
in your affections with another man. Sold my love for a 
for a place as bank president ! 

Borkman [gloomily and bowed down] . Hard necessity was 
upon me, Ella. 

Ella Rentheim [rises wild and quivering from the sofa]. 
Criminal ! 

Borkman [starts, but controls himself] . I have heard that 
word before. 

Ella Rentheim. Ah, never think that I mean your offence 
against the law of the land ! The use yon made of all those 
shares and obligations or whatever they were what do you 
think I care about that ! Had it been my lot to stand beside 
you when you were overwhelmed 

Borkman [eagerly] . What then, Ella ? 

Ella Rentheim. Believe me, I should gladly have borne it 
with you. The shame, the ruin, all, I would have helped 
you to bear it all. 

Borkman. Would you have ? Could you ? 

Ella Rentheim. Both would and could. For then I did 
not know of your great, your awful sin. 

Borkman. What ! What do you mean ? 

Ella Rentheim. I mean the sin for which there is no for- 
giveness. 

Borkman [gazing fixedly at her]. Ton must be beside 
yourself. 

Ella Rentheim [stepping nearer]. You are a murderer! 
You committed the great, the capital crime. 

Borkman [shrinks toward the piano] . Are you raving, Ella ? 

Ella Rentheim. You slew the love that was in me. [Nearer.] 
Do yon understand what that means ? The Bible speaks of a 
mysterious sin for which there is no forgiveness. I could not 
understand before what it might be. Now I understand. 
The great, unpardonable sin is to slay love in a human heart. 

Borkman. And I did that, you say ? 

Ella Rentheim. You did it. I never quite knew, until this 
evening, just what it was that had happened to me. That you 
deceived me, and turned to Gunhild instead, I took to be 
common fickleness on your part, and the result of her heart- 
less intrigues. And I almost think I despised you a little 
in spite of all. But now I see the truth. You deceived the 
woman you loved. Me, me, me ! What was dearest to you 
in the world you could put aside for the sake of gain. You 
made yourself guilty of a double murder the murder of 
your own soul and of mine ! 

The scene in which Borkman enters a plea 
for his own defence occurs in the third act. 
For the first time in eight years he enters his 
wife's apartment, where the latter and her sister 
are together. 

Fru Borkman [turning to Ella] . What does he want down 
here with me ? 

Ella Rentheim. He would try to come to an understanding 
with you, Gunhild. 

Fru Borkman. He never tried to do that before. 



Ella Rentheim. He will this evening. 

Fru Borkman. The last time we stood together it was in 
court. I was called to give testimony. 

Borkman [approaching her] . And this evening it is I that 
will give testimony. 

Fru Borkman [looking at him] . You ! 

Borkman. Not concerning the fact of my offence. The 
whole world knows that. 

Fru Borkman [with a deep sigh] . Yes, that is a true word. 
The whole world knows it. 

Borkman. But it does not know why I offended. Why I 
had to offend. Men do not realize that I had to, because I was 
myself because I was John Gabriel Borkman, and not an- 
other man. And that is what I am going to try to explain to 
you. 

Fru Borkman [shaking her head] . There is no use. Mo- 
tives exonerate no one, nor do inspirations either. 

Borkman. In one's own eyes they may. 

Fru Borkman [makes a deprecatory gesture]. Oh, let that 
be! I have ruminated enough over those dark matters of 
yours. 

Borkman. And I also. During the five endless years in my 
cell and elsewhere I have had time enough for it. And 
during the eight years in the room upstairs I have had a still 
better opportunity. I have given the whole case a rehearing 
for myself. I have taken it up over and over again. I have 
been my own accuser, my own counsel, and my own judge. 
More unpartisan than anyone else could be, I may say that. I 
have walked the floor up there and turned every one of my 
acts inside out and upside down, looked at them from before 
and behind in as unsparing and unpitying a way as any law- 
yer could have done. And the judgment I come to every time 
is thin that the only one I have sinned against is myself. 

Fru Borkman. Not against me ? Not against your son ? 

Borkman. I include you and him when I say myself. 

Fru Borkman. And the hundreds of others ? Those whom 
people say that you ruined ? 

Borkman [more passionately] . The power was mine, and 
the uncontrollable impulse was within me ! The buried mil- 
lions lay there about the land, deep in the mountains, and 
called to me, cried to me to set them free. But none of the 
others heard that. I was the only one. 

Fru Borkman. Yes, to the staining of the name of Borkman. 

Borkman. I would like to know if others, given the power, 
would not have acted just as I did. 

Fru Borkman. No one, no one but you would have done it. 

Borkman. Perhaps not. But if so, because they had not 
my endowments. And had they done it, it would not have 
been with my goal in view. The act would have become dif- 
ferent. Well and good I have acquitted myself. 

Ella Rentheim [tenderly and beseechingly]. Dare you say 
that so confidently, Borkman ? 

Borkman [nods]. Acquitted myself as far as that goes. 
But then comes the great, the crushing self-accusation. 

Fru Borkman. What is it ? 

Borkman. I have squandered eight precious years of my 
life upstairs there. The day I was set free, I should have 
faced the world of reality, of iron dreamless reality. I should 
have begun again at the bottom, and anew raised myself to 
the heights to greater heights than before in spite of all 
that lay between. 

Fru Borkman. It would have been to live the same life 
over again, believe me. 

Borkman [shakes his head and looks at her significantly] . 
Nothing new happens. But what has happened does not repeat 
itself. It is the eye that transforms the act. The new-born 
eye transforms the old act [breaking off] . Well, you don't 
understand that. 

Fru Borkman [curtly]. No, I don't understand it. 

Borkman. No, that is just the curse of it ; I never found 
a human soul who could understand me. 

Ella Rentheim [looking at him]. Never, Borkman? 

Borkman. Except one perhaps long, long ago. In the days 
when I did not feel the need of being understood. Otherwise, 
since then, never once. I have had no one early enough awake 
to call me up ring for me like a morning bell warning me

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



to cheerful work anew and to assure me that I have not sinned 
beyond atonement. 

Fru Borkman [with a scornful laugh]. And so you need 
outward assurance of that ? 

Borkman [with swelling anger]. Yes. When the whole 
world croaks in chorus that I am a hopelessly broken man, 
there are hours when I almost believe it [throwing his head 
back]. But then my inmost consciousness rises up triumphant, 
and acquits me. 

It would hardly be fair to take this defiant 
pronouncement as an expression of Dr. Ibsen's 
own opinion of Borkraan's offence. Like all 
strong dramatists, the author has too frequently 
been made chargeable with the sentiments and 
opinions of the characters created by him. 
What we may, however, justly take as the au- 
thor's personal message is the insistence upon 
individualism which is so marked in the scene 
just translated. No matter what a man may 
have done, he has a right to be heard as an 
individual, and commands a certain respect if 
he is strong enough to impress his individual 
character upon the minds of those with whom 
he is associated. 

This consideration leads us to the statement 
of another of the leading ideas of the play. 
The young Erhart is an individual also, and 
makes good his right to be respected as such. 
He is beset by the claims of three persons, each 
determined to exact from him what he is not 
bound to give. The father would have him 
share in the work of restoring a fallen reputa- 
tion. The mother would have him do much the 
same thing, although in a different independent 
way. The aunt would have him cling to her 
on account of her care for his childhood. But 
he impatiently shakes off these attempts to con- 
trol his activity, refuses to be bound by the 
influences of the older generation, determines 
to carve out his own career, and seeks for hap- 
piness in following the dictates of his own de- 
sires. We may pity him for the infatuation 
that takes him from home in the company of 
Mrs. Wilton, a woman several years his senior, 
and possibly we may despise him for his rejec- 
tion of any and all obligations toward those 
who have reared and cared for him, but we 
must recognize that he, too, no less than his 
father, has the right of every individual to live 
his own life (the author uses this very phrase, 
worn as it is, and gives it fresh vitality), to 
refuse to take upon his shoulders the burdens 
for the existence of which he is in no way re- 
sponsible. 

" No man can save his brother's soul, 
Or pay his brother's debt " 

might fairly be taken as the motto of this play, 
as far as it is concerned with Erhart. 



After the departure of the boy in his quest 
of the joy of life, the drama draws rapidly to 
its sombre but poetically impressive close. 
Borkman, who has left the confinement of his 
apartment for the first time in years, is seized 
with a sort of frenzy for the free air, and rushes 
from the house which the departure of his son 
has just left desolate. Although it is a winter 
night, and the earth is white with snow, he can- 
not be persuaded to return, and the fourth act 
takes place out of doors. At the end, Bork- 
man and Ella Rentheim are left together, she 
entreating him to seek shelter, and he declar- 
ing that he will never again breathe the air of 
the house that has so long confined him. Yield- 
ing to his stronger will, she follows him out 
into the darkness of the forest, and the land- 
scape shifts (as in the first act of " Parsifal ") 
with their progress. Finally, Borkman sinks 
down exhausted upon a rustic bench. He is a 
dying man, but his senses are quickened to 
unwonted acuteness, and he seems to enjoy a 
fulness of life that he has never known before. 

Borkman. Ella ! Do you see the mountain ranges there, far 
over yonder, one behind the other. They rise, they tower. 
There is my deep, my infinite, my inexhaustible kingdom. 

Ella Rentheim. Ah, but there comes an icy blast from that 
kingdom, John. 

Borkman. That blast is the breath of life to me, it comes 
like a greeting from my trusty spirits. I see them, the buried 
millions ; I feel the veins of metal, they stretch out their bent, 
branching, enticing arms toward me. I saw them before me 
like shades endowed with life that night when I stood in 
the bank vault, candle in hand. You sought to be free then, 
and I tried to free you. But I could not. The treasure sank 
again into the depths [stretching forth his hands] . But I will 
whisper it to you here amid the peace of night. I love you as 
you lie there deep and dark in the semblance of death. I love 
you, wealth yearning for life, with all your shining train of 
power and glory I love you, love you, love you ! 

Ella Rentheim [with quiet, growing feeling]. Yes, your 
affections are still set down there, John, they were always 
there. But up here in the light of day, there was a warm 
living human heart that beat for you. And you crushed that 
heart. Ah, more than that tenfold worse you sold it 
for for 

Borkman [shivering as with the cold]. For the sake of the 
kingdom, and the power, and the glory you mean ? 

Ella Rentheim. Yes, I mean that. I told you this evening 
once before. You slew affection in the woman who loved you, 
and whom you loved in return, as far as you could love any- 
one [with upraised arm] . And therefore I foretell you this, 
John Gabriel Borkman, you will never win the prize you 
craved for that deed. You will never enter triumphant into 
your cold and gloomy kingdom ! 

Borkman [staggers to the bench and sits heavily down]. 
I almost fear that you are right in your prophecy, Ella. 

Ella Rentheim [sitting beside him]. You must not fear it, 
John. It would be the best thing that could happen to you. 

Borkman [with a cry, putting his hand to his breast] . Ah ! 
Now it let me go. 

Ella Rentheim [shaking him] . What was it, John ? 

Borkman [falling against the arm of the bench] . It was a 
hand of ice, that plucked at my heart. 

Etta Rentheim. John, did you feel that icy hand for the 
first time now ? 

Borkman [muttering] . No. No hand of ice. It was a hand 
of metal. [He sinks wholly down upon the bench.]

Ella Rentheim [takes off her cloak and covers him -with it]. 
Stay quietly where you lie. I go to bring you aid. [She takes 
a step or two, stops, turns back, feels his pulse, and passes 
her hand over his face. Then softly but firmly.] No, better 
so, John Borkman. Better so for you. [She wraps the cloak 
closer around him, and sits down in the snow in front of the 
bench.] 

Presently Fru Borkman appeal's, and finds her 
sister watching over Borkman's dead body. 

Fru Borkman. So the night air killed him. 

Ella Rentheim. It must be so. 

Fru Borkman. Him, the strong man. 

Ella Rentheim. Will you not look at him, Gunhild ? 

Fru Borkman. No, no, no. [With lowered voice.] He was 
a miner's son he, the bank president. He could not breathe 
the free air. 

Ella Rentheim. It was rather the cold that killed him. 

Fru Borkman [shaking her head] . The cold, you say ? The 
cold had killed him long before. 

Ella Rentheim. And made shadows of us both, yes. 

Fru Borkman. You are right. 

Ella Rentheim [with a sad smile]. One dead man and two 
shadows the cold has done that. 

Fru Borkman. Yes, the cold in the heart. And now we 
may clasp hands, Ella. 

Ella Rentheim. Yes, I think we may now. 

Fru Borkman. We twin-sisters, over his body, whom we 
both loved. 

Ella Rentheim. We two shadows over the dead man. 

[Fru Borkman, behind the bench, and Ella Rentheim, be- 
fore it, reach hands to one another, and the curtain falls.] 

The scenes which we have translated suffi- 
ciently set forth the leading ideas of the play, 
although they leave untouched several impor- 
tant features in the development of its action. 
Enough has been given, perhaps, to make clear 
the fact that this play is a more straightforward 
and intelligible piece of work than Dr. Ibsen 
has of late been wont to give us. It has not 
the tenderness of " Little Eyolf," nor has it the 
haunting symbolism of " Master Builder Sol- 
ness." But it has a strength and a closeness 
of texture in which those plays are somewhat 
lacking, and we should judge that it will prove 
peculiarly effective as an acting drama. An 
English translation, presumably done by Mr. 
William Archer in his customary wooden way, 
is announced for early publication in this 
country. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL." 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In the discussion of this topic in recent issues of THE 
DIAL, it has been either asserted or assumed that a 
typical American novel is an immediate possibility, that 
such a novel is desired by the American people in order 
that they may be " rightly understood and justified," 
and that the day of its appearance may be hastened by 
our laying down principles for the guidance of the au- 
thor. 

If there really is a desire on the part of our people to 



see themselves represented in the Great American 
Novel, this in itself argues that the proper time for such 
a novel has not yet arrived. An undue degree of self- 
consciousness will neither give us the right kind of au- 
thor nor the fit material for him to deal with. It is to 
be hoped that some day the desire to pose as the latest, 
and politically the best, product of civilization will in a 
measure be outgrown, and that the American people, 
while conscious of the noble work they have been given 
to perform, will, because more sure of themselves, be 
less concerned than formerly about the opinions of the 
rest of the world. From a cosmopolitan point of view, 
there is something provincial in the idea that we must 
have a Great American Novel to represent us in uni- 
versal literature; for the truest literature is often the 
least national. We may have improved upon some of 
the world's old ways, but that hardly implies that we 
need extraordinary means of interpreting ourselves to 
mankind. If some of the national activities have so far 
failed to be adequately portrayed in fiction, one reason 
may be that they are not of the kind to furnish a suffi- 
cient motive for a great novel. 

It may, indeed, be doubted whether any people is, or 
can be, adequately represented by any one novel or even 
by any one novelist. It seems that national life is too 
broad and complex to be properly dealt with within such 
a compass, and especially so in the case of the compos- 
ite national life of America. The author of such a work 
would have to possess a breadth of knowledge, a reach 
of imagination, a moral equipoise, and a literary art, 
that, in combination, are as rare as a Homer or a Shake- 
speare. Moreover, our national character is yet in its 
formative stage, and the best that our great novelist 
could do, in many directions, would be to represent gen- 
eral tendencies and traits of smaller or larger groups. 
Another difficulty that would beset him would be the con- 
sciousness of the magnitude of his task; for in proportion 
as he should think of the impression his work ought to 
make would he be disqualified for carrying it out suc- 
cessfully: he would then represent, not American life, 
but his own ideas of such a life. Little good can there- 
fore come from considering what the Great American 
Novel should contain except the good that results from 
the contemplation of an ideal possibility. The novelist 
in question if he ever appears will be a law unto 
himself and will be inspired by the artistic capabilities 
of his subject rather than by its political and ethical 
greatness. 

The writer is in accord with many of the ideas ex- 
pressed on this subject in THE DIAL, and he takes excep- 
tion not so much to anything therein affirmed as to a cer- 
tain habit of mind or point of view to which some of those 
ideas seemed to lend a color. ANDREW ESTREM.

THE PRIMARY CONDITION OF UNDERSTANDING 

WHITMAN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The reviewer in your columns of the recent publica- 
tions on Whitman by Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Burroughs 
has fallen, it seems to me, into the pit dug for all who 
seek to maintain what is called the judicial and critical 
attitude towards Whitman: he has commended a poor 
book and condemned a good one. Mr. Donaldson can 
easily be proved untrustworthy in a hundred points. He 
was, apparently, always out of focus, and never saw 
Whitman, the man, at all. The report he makes is 



42 



THE DIAL, 



[Jan. 16, 



wholly inadequate, sometimes false, and is one more 
instance of the fact that one can see only what he has 
eyes to see. The study by Mr. Burroughs has, on the 
other hand, the mark of intimate acquaintance with the 
man and of full comprehension of his work. Mr. Bur- 
roughs has satisfied the first condition imposed by Whit- 
man upon his readers, and placed himself not only in 
mental but also in emotional relations to his subject; 
and his volume is vitalized by feeling and intuition. His 
success is manifestly due to his deep and wide sympathy, 
his power to respond to a genuine personal call, his ca- 
pacity to absorb and be absorbed by a great personality. 
His attitude toward other poets is determined, for the 
time being, by his devotion to the single object, a devo- 
tion that is absolutely essential to interpretation. I 
think the reason for the general misapprehension of 
Whitman springs from the extraordinary demands made 
by the poet upon his readers for their personal sympathy 
the same demand Christ made of the rich man to 
leave all and follow him. My thesis, in short, is that 
personal absorption is the price of understanding Whitman. 
Christ's " Follow me " is not more absolute than Whit- 
man's " Come, give me your hand." When accepted with- 
out reservation, without the hesitating, niggardly spirit 
of criticism, " Leaves of Grass " inevitably arouses the 
feeling of love and the desire of comradeship. I believe 
it to be true that no one can read " Leaves of Grass " 
with understanding who has not capacities for an ex- 
alted human brotherhood. Whitman makes lovers of 
his readers. As a matter of fact he exercises to-day an 
influence unparalleled in contemporary history, an influ- 
ence like that maintained by Socrates over the young 
men of Greece. And this is felt not only by those who, 
like Mr. Burroughs, were his associates in life, but 
from far-off lands, wherever the book circulates from 
Sarrazin in Paris, Symonds in London, Schmidt in Co- 
penhagen, Rolleston in Leipzig, Gay in Melbourne, 
Popoff in St. Petersburg. The boundless enthusiasm 
manifested by these and other comrades is not an evi- 
dence of uncritical mind and unbalanced faculty, but a 
witness, rather, that the full response which the book 
requires has been rendered, that the human qualities 
contained in it have struck out a kindred life in others. 
By so much as a reader remains cold, critical, disinter- 
ested, before an object requiring the feeling of identity 
and the desire of comradeship as the condition of under- 
standing, to that extent does he fail in his interpretation. 
This is a case where an author absolutely creates his 
own audience. The proof of this poet shall be sternly 
deferred until his country absorbs him as affectionately 
as he absorbed it. 

The assumption of a new attitude toward Whitman 
is necessary because he has fully freed himself from all 
old requirements and declared for new and enlarged 
modes of literature suited to the modern and the dem- 
ocratic. His book contains a life not an intellect alone, 
but a complete, perfectly healthy, unconventional, un- 
conditioned man; and not the mere statement of the 
man, but a free, full rendering of his actual personality 
in poetic terms. He himself is the theme of the poems. 
Democracy, philosophy, science, are not stated in theory, 
but are concreted in his being. The aim of the book 
being to stimulate personality, its appeal is made almost 
wholly to the will and the moral nature. This pecu- 
liarity compels the reader to put himself not merely in 
mental but in emotional relations to the author. " When 
I give, I give myself," the poet says. " Stop this day 
and night with me and you shall possess the origin of 



all poems." " I act as the tongue of you." His own 
statement (reported in the Springfield " Republican ") 
is: " In my own poems, all concentrates in, radiates from, 
revolves about myself. I have but one central figure, the 
general human personality typified in myself. Only I am 
sure my book inevitably necessitates that its reader trans- 
pose him or herself into that central position, and become 
the actor, experiencer, himself or herself, of every page, 
every aspiration, every line." The unique composition 
of " Leaves of Grass " is hereby indicated. Other books 
remain standing on the outside of our identity, and con- 
tribute only to our taste or knowledge ; this book incor- 
porates itself with the reader, passes into and becomes 
body and soul, contributes health, pride, freedom, love, 
consciousness. If the fusion of identities does not take 
place, the words of the book are meaningless, its ego- 
tism displeasing, its announcements foolishness. Of all 
the critics, the case of Mr. Gosse is most significant. 
He visited Whitman at Camden, felt the charm of his 
personality, acknowledged his previous errors of judg- 
ment respecting the man himself, but, retaining his pro- 
fessional habit toward the book, he persisted in his con- 
clusion that the single merit of " Leaves of Grass " was 
a certain felicity of phrase. Wanting the democratic 
attitude, he failed to perceive that every noble quality 
that was in the man appears in full measure in his book. 
When a new sun rises in the heavens, a single open eye 
is worth for testimony all the closed eyes in the world. 
Place by the side of the negative criticism, the report of 
T. W. Rolleston: " First, we are made aware in him of 
the working of an intellect whose depth and compass 
appears more and more astonishing the further we pen- 
etrate into it. Second, we find in him a wealth of poetic 
power whose beauty impresses us the more profoundly 
and lastingly for the very reason that it is not made an 
end and aim in itself. Third, the fit reader is brought 
into relationship with something still more unusual and 
valuable than either intellect or poetry he finds that 
an indescribable, magical, personal influence streams 
forth from the leaves; he is not brought into contact with 
a book, but with a man, with a friend, whose spirit, by 
nothing that we can call a doctrine, but by actual pres- 
ence, acts upon ours, strengthening, exalting, purifying, 
and liberating." OSCAR LOVELL TRIGGS.

MISS MOLINEUX'S "BROWNING PHKASE BOOK." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The writer of the notice of the " Browning Phrase 
Book " in THE DIAL for January 1 apparently does not 
fully understand the plan of the book. The passage 
from " The Ring and the Book " which he cites is to be 
found under Lover on page 150: 

" O lover of my life, O soldier-saint, 

No work begun shall ever pause for death ! " 
It is also referred to in the Index three times under 
Death, Pause, and Work ; and under each the page on 
which the passage occurs is added. Of course a person 
consulting the Index would have no difficulty in find- 
ing the passage in the body of the book. I presume 
that most, if not all, of the other " choice quotations " 
mentioned by the reviewer could be found in the same 
way. 

The Index increases the value of the book greatly for 
purposes of reference, while it keeps its bulk within 
moderate and inexpensive limits.

(" This recreative pause and breathing-while ") may be 
" slightly significant," but it seems to me worthy of 
inclusion among " quotable passages." If the other pas- 
sage had been entirely omitted from the body of the 
book, the reviewer's criticism would have been in point. 

As no edition of Browning has line-number, the refer- 
ences in the book come necessarily to pages. The com- 
pact one-volume " Cambridge " edition is so neat, con- 
venient, and cheap, that students of the poet will be 
likely to buy it even if they already own the sixteen- 
volume English or the six-volume " Riverside " edition. 

I have tested the book in many ways, and have found 
it eminently satisfactory. w. J. R t 

Cambridge, January 4, 1897. 

[The reviewer of the "Browning Phrase-Book" 
is under no misapprehension as to the plan of that 
work. Before writing the notice, he also had 
" tested the book in many ways," during two months 
of very frequent use while engaged in an undertak- 
ing that would have made a really good work of the 
kind of very great value. It is true, as Dr. Rolfe 
states, that the passage whose supposed omission is 
criticised ( " No work begun shall ever pause for 
death " ) is in the book ; but it might almost as well 
not be there as to he placed under so inadequate 
and blind a reference as Lover, instead of under 
either one of the obvious pivotal words Death, 
Work, or Pause. To illustrate suppose a Shake- 
speare Phrase- Book should insert the lines, 

" The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, 
But in ourselves that we are underlings," 

under the catchword Brutus, and there only. The 
case is precisely parallel when the citation in ques- 
tion is placed under Lover and nowhere else. This 
lack of a sense of pertinency is one of the things 
that make the book so disappointing. And we can- 
not think that this defect is remedied by the single- 
word Index. The preface of the work speaks of 
this as a " novel feature "; the experiment can 
hardly be regarded as satisfactory. Suppose, in the 
case under consideration, that the student, disap- 
pointed in his search at the proper places through 
the Phrase-Book, follows Dr. Rolfe's advice and 
turns to the Index. He may then take his choice 
between looking up, one by one, either the thirty- 
eight references under Death, the fifteen under 
Work, or the five under Pause, until by greater or 
less good luck his will-'o-the-wisp chase is rewarded 
by stumbling upon the right one. The addition of 
a word or two from the context would have added 
but little to the work of the compiler, and, type 
being chosen judiciously, very little to the bulk of 
the volume. It is difficult to see any use in a single- 
word Index, except as a curiosity for the linguist. 
The reviewer's disappointment with this book was 
in proportion to his anticipations of its publication. 
The compiler's frank confession of the lapses and 
losses of various kinds which involved a change of 
plan during the process of the book's evolution ex- 
cites the reader's sympathy, but does not mend its 
shortcomings when he applies to it for aid. THE 
REVIEWER.] 



SOME DISPUTED HIBERNICISMS. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

A little article by me on Irishisms, in the " Atlantic 
Contributors' Club," has called out some diverting dis- 
cussions, which perhaps may be worth pursuing a little 
farther. One writer challenges particularly my instances 
of gyarden and gyirl, and cites Walker as authority, add- 
ing that " Walker in his Pronouncing Dictionary dis- 
tinctly adopts the pronunciation gyirl." " In fact," 
continues my critic, " Walker defends the injection of 
the y- sound after the letters c, g, and k." It may be 
that I have blundered, but if I have, I think I have at 
least blundered in good company. For I have always 
understood that gyirl, gyarden, cyar, etc., are to be re- 
garded as Hibernicisms, and not to mention others 
Lowell so regarded them in his entertaining and instruc- 
tive paper on the Yankee Dialect. 

In regard to Walker it must be borne in mind that 
his pronunciation represents, in the main, the received 
pronunciation of the last century. For although his 
dictionary was published in this century, yet Walker 
acquired his pronunciation in the latter half of the last 
century. No one, therefore, who is familiar with lin- 
guistic principles would cite a lexicographer of the eigh- 
teenth century or of the first decade of the nineteenth 
as an authority for English pronunciation in the present 
year of grace. As well say at once that our language 
has undergone no change in the course of the present 
century a thing which no student of English is pre- 
pared to admit. I am aware that in the last century, 
and in the first quarter of the present, kyar for car and 
gyirl, etc., were of common occurrence, and perhaps were 
even the jus et norma loquendi, but they are no longer 
the standard pronunciation either in England or America. 
They are now antiquated and are generally considered 
Hibernicisms, perhaps because of their wide currency 
among the uneducated Irish. (I do not include, of course, 
the educated Irish, though even some of them may have 
a predilection for the pronunciation in question.) 

I cite only one authority, whose words in a matter of 
this kind are presumably entitled to our respect, to 
show that Walker's pronunciation cannot be taken as 
authoritative in questions of present-day pronunciation. 
Ellis, in his great work on English Pronunciation 
(Vol. I., p. 206) says: " As respects the particular usage 
\kyart, kyind, skyarlet, skyi, gyard, gyuide, etc., for cart, 
kind, etc.] it is now antiquated in English. But in 
Walker's time it was so much the custom that he found 
it ' impossible ' to pronounce garrison and carriage with 
the pure (g, k), without any inserted (i) sound." 

I did not undertake in my brief article to explain the 
phonetics of the pronunciations which we now commonly 
regard as Hibernicisms. I am of the opinion, though I 
have not investigated the subject thoroughly, that these 
antiquated pronunciations can be shown to reach back 
to the principle of Anglo-Saxon " breaking," and so are 
really survivals of an early palatalization.

ARCHITECTS AND ARCHITECTURE.* 

Extravagant praise and an occasional sug- 
gestion of what Matthew Arnold called " a full 
habit of style" mar somewhat the general effect 
of Miss Harriet Monroe's otherwise satisfac- 
tory life of John Wellborn Root. Miss Monroe's 
unbounded admiration for her relative is touch- 
ing and creditable in itself ; but had she tem- 
pered the expression of it, and limited herself 
to a sober account of Mr. Root and his work, 
done throughout in plain prose, she would in 
our judgment have produced a better book and 
a more effective panegyric. But notwithstand- 
ing the rather frequent poetic excursions of the 
sort referred to, there is a good deal of terse 
straightforward narrative in the volume 
enough to help the judicious reader to a fair 
idea of Mr. Root and of the value, influence, 
and character of his work. 

It is in discussing Mr. Root's work as an 
architect, rather than his character as a man, 
that the author is at her best. Her chapters 
on his " Ideas of Modern Architecture," " His 
Work and its Results," and on his share in the 
Columbian Exposition, are critical and intelli- 
gent, and will command the respect of profes- 
sional readers. What Mr. Root did for the 
Fair is thus stated by Messrs. Charles L. 
Hutchinson and Owen F. Aldis, both leading 
members of its committees. Says Mr. Hutch- 
inson : 

"You cannot overstate John Root's services to the 
Exposition. He wanted Jackson Park when the land- 
scape gardeners and nearly every member of the Com- 
mittee were opposed to it. In the beginning of the 
enterprise, he saw very clearly, more clearly than all 
others, how beautiful would be the effect of combining 
land and water in this park; and he persisted until 
everyone else came around to his opinion. It was his 
mind, more than any other, which was felt in the initia- 
tive of the great enterprise." 

Mr. Aldis says : 

" John Root made the Fair until he died or no, I 
must modify that, because Mr. Olmsted had a share in 
it; I do n't know how great. From these two men came 
the artistic impetus of the Columbian Exposition, and it 
was carried out on the large lines they laid down." 

Intelligent visitors to the Fair pretty gen-

erally agreed that the finest and most impres- 
sive thing about it was its outward ensemble ; 
and while the more general features of that 
ensemble were evidently planned by Mr. Root, 
we learn that his conception of the Fair " dif- 
fered much from the White City of memory." 
Miss Monroe gives a gracefully written outline 
sketch of what the Exposition might have been 
architecturally had Mr. Root's ideals, or rather 
his " initial preferences," been carried out in 
detail. It would have been, not a White City, 
but a City of Color ; not .a seemingly perma- 
nant city of counterfeit marble, but a frankly 
ephemeral one of multiform parti-colored struc- 
tures, rising, as it were, overnight " like an 
exhalation," and vanishing as swiftly when its 
purpose was served. 

" The fundamental point in Root's creed as an archi- 
tect was sincerity: a building should frankly express its 
purpose and its material. . . . He wished to frankly 
admit in the architectural scheme the temporary char- 
acter of the Fair: it should be a great, joyous, luxuriant 
midsummer efflorescence, born to bloom for an hour 
and perish a splendid buoyant thing, flaunting its gay 
colors between the shifting blues of sky and lake, exul- 
tantly, prodigally. . . . Among all the tentative sketches 
of the Fair, or portions of it, which Root threw off from 
day to day during these busy weeks, there is scarcely a 
trace of a classic motive. On the contrary, there is 
much that is unconventional or even bizarre, conceived 
in a lyric mood with delightful freshness and spontaneity. 
He was much pleased one day when an English artist, 
trained in the schools, but hospitable to new sugges- 
tions, recognized what he was striving for in one of 
these drawings : ' You 've got an exuberant barbaric 
effect there a kind of an American Kremlin,' he said, 
lots of color and noise and life.' . . . Root's possible 
decisions in points of detail are of course a mere matter 
of conjecture. . . . Staff, which had been used exten- 
sively in Paris, was not his preference for large struc- 
tures, though it might have been his choice eventually 
for a great deal of the work. He would never have 
used it in imitation of marble, but he would have appre- 
ciated its delightful temptations to gayety of modelling 
and coloring. But whatever the materials, his whole 
heart was centred upon his hope of an American Fair 
an architectural scheme which should express exuber- 
antly our young, crude, buoyant civilization, and strike 
our note at last in the world's art." 

Few, we fancy, who carry in memory the 
serene and classic beauty of the White City will 
regret that the phase of Mr. Root's architect- 
ural scheme above outlined, with its showy 
gimcrackery of the " American Kremlin " 
order, failed of realization. It must not be 
inferred that Mr. Root's aim at originality and 
his ambition of a national type of architecture 
were of the sort that affects to despire the les- 
sons and ignore the conventions of the past. 
He was the student and scholar, as well as the 
man of original gift. " No true success," he

used to say, " comes to an architect who is not 
grounded in the classics. Life is not long 
enough for one to himself discover those laws of 
beauty which thousands of years have evolved 
for architecture." These wise and clear words, 
weighed with the authority that belongs to prac- 
tical achievement, may well be pondered by 
those who idly preach the notion of a national 
art whose roots shall strike no deeper than our 
own new and shallow soil. Miss Monroe's book 
is fairly readable, and the more important part 
of it is acceptably written. It forms a warmly 
enthusiastic and at times an eloquent tribute to 
the memory of a gifted and genial man. Me- 
chanically, and notably in the matter of illus- 
trations, the volume is a noble product. The 
plates comprise mainly choice and characteris- 
tic examples of the work of Mr. Root, of whom 
there is an attractive frontispiece portrait. 

Mr. Charles Thompson Mathews's " Story 
of Architecture " is a concise and serviceable 
manual, profusely illustrated, the scope and aim 
of which are fairly indicated in the title. The 
book is a good example of the popular yet 
instructive treatment of a technical theme ; and 
we commend it to readers desirous of acquiring 
quickly and agreeably a fair general knowledge 
of the history of " the most useful of the fine 
arts, and the finest of the useful arts." That 
history, properly speaking, begins at the point 
where the idea of beauty, of harmonious distri- 
bution of mass, first influenced the work of the 
builder all the previous unfolding of the craft 
belonging, as the author says, to archaeology. 
Beginning with the architecture of Egypt, Mr. 
Mathews proceeds to consider in turn (con- 
stantly keeping in view the influence upon each 
style of the three prime forces climate, race, 
and religion) that of India, Indo-China, and 
Java ; Eastern Asia ; Mexico, Central Amer- 
ica, and Peru ; Assyria and Western Asia ; 
Greece ; Etruria and Rome ; the Byzantine 
style ; Early Christian architecture ; the Sara- 
cenic style ; the Romanesque style ; the Gothic 
style ecclesiastical and secular ; the Renais- 
sance. The volume closes with a brief review 
of American architecture, in the course of which 
the author observes of the World's Fair (after 
quoting the statement of the President of the 
Royal Institute of British Architects that " the 
Court of Honor was the grandest thing archi- 
tecturally that the world had ever seen since 
the days of Pericles ": 

" Concerning individual buildings, it seems to be gen- 
erally conceded that the Fine Arts Building was the 



most beautiful thing ever erected in this country as 
regards purity and distribution; while the gem for mod- 
esty and simplicity among the more subordinate works 
bore the prosaic and uninspiring title of the Merchant 
Tailors' Building." 

More technical and analytical in treatment 
than the foregoing work is Mr. Russell Stur- 
gis's scholarly historical study of " European 
Architecture." The book is offered primarily 
as a guide to students intending to inspect for 
themselves the buildings described in it ; but it 
should also prove most helpful to readers whose 
conceptions of those buildings must be derived 
from photographs, etc. As to the latter class 
of readers, Mr. Sturgis observes : 

" For those who cannot at once visit the monuments 
which still exist in Europe, it may be said that their 
position toward all European architecture is not unlike 
the position which the most favored of us hold with re- 
gard to Greek and Roman architecture. Greek and 
Roman monuments have perished, and their loveliness 
or grandeur can be appreciated only by a mental pro- 
cess of reconstruction. Somewhat in the same way the 
stay-at-home student may get much comfort out of 
photographs accompanied by trustworthy plans. To 
such students, also, this book is offered as a help in the 
interpretation of their photographs." 

The chapter headings are : " Grecian Archi- 
tecture "; " Roman Imperial Architecture "; 
"The Architecture of Europe, 350 to 750 
A.D."; " The Architecture of Europe, 750 to 
1150 A. D."; "Architecture of Western Eu- 
rope," 1150 to 1300 A. D., and so on down to 
" Architecture of Western Europe, 1665 to 
1789 A. D." The text is profusely sprinkled 
with woodcuts ; and besides these there are nine 
full-page photographic plates of good quality. 
The book is attractively made, and may be 
commended without reserve to those for whom 
it is written. E. G. J. 



MR. HERBERT SPENCER'S FINAL, VOLUME.* 

With the appearance of Mr. Herbert Spen- 
cer's concluding volume of " The Principles of 
Sociology " the end of a long journey is reached, 
and a noble monument, more enduring than 
bronze, will keep alive the memory of a great 
thinker to whom the world owes more than we 
can yet comprehend. The preface to this con- 
cluding volume of Mr. Spencer's " Synthetic 
Philosophy " is one of the most pathetic yet 
inspiring passages of literature. It does not 
complain nor moaningly expose personal weak 
ness, and it shows a lofty and serene spirit that

[Jan. 16, 



has so long toiled in " leisure, parf aitlie," ac- 
cording " to the plan that pleased his childish 
thought," or rather the plan of early manhood. 
A quiet tone of exultation is in the words, " It 
may fairly be said that, if not absolutely in the 
way specified, the promise of the prospectus 
has been redeemed." This " invalid of seventy- 
six " looks back on " six-and-thirty years which 
have passed since the Synthetic Philosophy was 
commenced," and adds : 

" I am surprised at my audacity in undertaking it, 
and still more surprised by its completion. In 1860 my 
small resources had been nearly all frittered away in 
writing and publishing books which did not repay their 
expenses; and I was suffering under a chronic disorder, 
caused by over-tax of brain in 1855, which, wholly dis- 
abling me for eighteen months, thereafter limited my 
work to three hours a day, and usually to less. How 
insane my project must have seemed to on-lookers, may 
be judged from the fact that before the first chapter of 
the first volume was finished, one of my nervous break- 
downs obliged me to desist. But imprudent courses do 
not always fail. Sometimes a forlorn hope is justified 
by the event. Though, along with other deterrents, 
many relapses, now lasting for weeks, now for months, 
and once for years, often made me despair of reaching 
the end, yet at length the end is reached. Doubtless 
in earlier days some exultation would have resulted; 
but as age creeps on feelings weaken, and now my 
chief pleasure is in my emancipation. Still, there is sat- 
isfaction in the consciousness that losses, discourage- 
ments, and shattered health, have not prevented me 
from fulfilling the purpose of my life." 

The volume just from the press contains 
three parts : Ecclesiastical Institutions, Pro- 
fessional Institutions, and Industrial Institu- 
tions. The first part has been published in 
book form, the second in journal articles, while 
the third appears here for the first time and 
will probably excite the greatest interest and 
stir most debate. But the principles which 
underlie the treatment have long been familiar 
to the world in previous writings of the author. 
Under the head of " Ecclesiastical Institutions" 
there is a discussion of the religious idea, 
medicine - men and priests, priestly duties of 
descendants, the ruler as priest, the rise of a 
priesthood, polytheistic and monotheistic priest- 
hoods, ecclesiastical hierarchies, an ecclesias- 
tical system as a social bond, the military func- 
tions of priests, the civil functions of priests, 
Church and State, nonconformity, the moral 
influences of priesthoods, ecclesiastical retro- 
spect and prospect, and religious retrospect and 
prospect. Under " Professional Institutions " 
the author treats the evolution from the priestly 
class of the professions of physicians and sur- 
geons, dancers and musicians, orators, poets, 
actors, dramatists, biographers, historians, men 
of letters, men of science and philosophy, judges 



and lawyers, teachers and architects, sculptors, 
painters. 

Turning to the part now first presented in 
this complete form to the public, we find a 
treatise on the economic history of mankind. 
Brief and condensed as is the statement, we en- 
joy the results of a comparison of the industrial 
systems of all the races of mankind. The lit- 
erary form of this statement is clear, readable, 
and even pictorial. The illustrations from par- 
ticular peoples serve to illuminate the abstract 
formulas of the philosophy. Of course the 
final criticism of the data and of the judgments 
must rest with ethnologists and students of 
culture-history, but the broad and comprehen- 
sive method is one which expands the mind and 
helps us to see the relations of our economic 
problems to the larger life of the race. One 
is impressed by the idea that there are laws 
of development, and that the social order is by 
no means capricious and unintelligible. 

The introduction to this part of the work 
deals with the difficulties of developing an 
industrial system. Nature is a step -mother 
which yields only what is earned. Chronic 
war hinders the peaceful pursuits of agricul- 
ture. Human nature itself, formed by ages of 
habit, is not quickly and easily adjusted to new 
conditions. Provident habits, increased intel- 
ligence and foresight, must be slowly acquired. 
The tyranny of custom must be broken. But 
forming forces have gradually removed obstruc- 
tions and developed momentum ; " until at 
length the speed has become such that the 
improvements which science and enterprise 
have achieved during this century are greater 
in amount than those achieved during all past 
centuries put together." 

The chapter on the specialization of func- 
tions and division of labor is necessary to the 
logical order, and is happily written, but is 
already familiar. This is true of the chapters 
on acquisition and production and on distribu- 
tion. The more highly developed systems are 
discussed under the titles " auxiliary distribu- 
tion," " auxiliary exchange," etc. The close of 
a chapter on inter-dependence and integration, 
after a masterly exposition of the natural 
growth of our commercial system, brings out 
one of the favorite ideas of the author. The 
modern world is clamoring for the " organiza- 
tion of labor." Men suppose that at present 
labor is unorganized. They are blind to the mar- 
vellous specializations and connections which 
the human race has already built up out of its 
experiences. Then follows a rhetorical thrust 



1897.] 



47 



which, like the needle of a wasp, carries the 
venom under the skin : " A fly seated on the 
surface of the body has about as good a con- 
ception of its internal structure as one of these 
schemers has of the social organization in which 
he is imbedded." 

The various modes of the regulation of labor 
are traced according to the principles of the 
law of evolution from rude beginnings to the 
contemporary system. The industrial regula- 
tion has been differentiated from ecclesiastical 
and political control ; has freed itself by slow 
degrees from the extreme consciousness which 
goes with a militant state of society ; has passed 
from paternal to patriarchal and communal 
methods, through guilds, slavery, serfdom, to 
free labor and contract. Mr. Spencer regards 
the " wage system " as only relatively the best 
for our age ; as very superior to the systems of 
slavery, serfdom, and guilds, but as certain to 
yield place to a higher form of organization 
better adapted to freedom and self-development. 

" The wage-earning factory-hand does, indeed, exem- 
plify entirely free labor, in so far that, making contracts 
at will and able to break them after short notice, he is 
free to engage with whomsoever he pleases and when 
he pleases. But this liberty amounts in practice to little 
more than the ability to exchange one slavery for an- 
other; since, fit only for his particular occupation, he 
has rarely an opportunity of doing anything more than 
decide in what mill he will pass the greater part of his 
dreary days." 

When Mr. Debs comes to quote this passage 
it will be called " incendiary," and out of its 
context it may be so. The context also must 
be quoted : 

" It seems that in the course of social progress, parts, 
more or less large, of each society, are sacrificed for the 
benefit of the society as a whole. . . . Men are used up 
for the benefit of posterity; and so long as they go on 
multiplying in excess of the means of subsistence, there 
appears no remedy." 

Thus the wet-blanket of Malthusianism 
quenches the flame of the socialistic orator. 

The depressing passage just quoted, how- 
ever, must be read in connection with the hope- 
ful but moderate commendations of cooperation ' 
and trade-unionism. Trade-unionism is rela- 
tively justifiable in the transition from a mili- 
tant type of industrial society to a peaceful 
type. Cooperation is the form of industrial 
production and regulation for the future. But 
it is a distant future. 

"The practicability of such a system depends on 
character. Throughout this volume it has been vari- 
ously shown that higher types of society are made pos- 
sible only by higher types of nature; and the implica- 
tion is that the best industrial institutions are possible 
only with the best men." 



And human nature is transformed much more 
slowly than the dissolving views called Utopias. 

Socialism is curtly dismissed in a short chap- 
ter, and solemnly, bitterly, renounced with all 
its works. All the more bitterly is it assailed 
because Mr. Spencer feels that it is gaining 
power and will lead back to despotism and an 
inferior type of man. But only temporarily. 
Here and there will arise self-governing, self- 
reliant, self -supporting peoples, " who have not 
been emasculated by fostering their feebles 
peoples before whom the socialistic organization 
will go down like a house of cards, as did that 
of the ancient Peruvians before a handful of 
Spaniards." The volume closes with a repeti- 
tion of the belief expressed fifty years ago : 

" The ultimate man will be one whose private re- 
quirements coincide with public ones. He will be that 
manner of man who, in spontaneously fulfiling his own 
nature, incidentally performs the functions of a social 
unit; and yet is only enabled so to fulfil his own nature 
by all others doing the like." 

Thus is completed one of the most compre- 
hensive intellectual enterprises of our century. 
The reviewer refrains from obtruding his own 
criticisms in a brief notice. He may regard 
Mr. Spencer's religious attitude and his theory 
of philosophy as unsound, vague, and defective 
in vital points. He may object to his extreme 
individualism and his policeman theory of the 
State. A great army presents many points of 
attack. But profoundly as we may differ from 
this illustrious author, we all owe him a debt of 
lasting gratitude. When the errors of his sys- 
tem have been exposed and corrected, and when 
the gaps have all been filled, there will remain 
the vast framework of a plan consistent as that 
of Aquinas and only somewhat less comprehen- 
sive ; and there will remain also the picture of 
a broken man toiling away for thirty-six years 
without surrender, even when almost in despair ; 
and there will remain the example of a man 
whose words always expressed the actual state 
of his mind with perfect transparency and ac- 
curacy, because he had nothing to conceal. He 
had no reverence for sham, and many of his 
most severe attacks on the Church were de- 
served and will leave the genuine elements of 
religion more conspicuous for the destruction 
of masks and counterfeits. He reserved his 
worship, " mostly of the silent sort," for that 
Power which he called the Unknowable, but 
to whom his writings have ever, implicitly or 
explicitly, ascribed the qualities of goodness 
and justice which are centred in Jesus's ideal 
of the Heavenly Father.

THE FIRST Two CENTURIES or 
PRINTED BOOKS.* 

It was Carlyle was it not? who said that 
the value of a book was often measured by its 
preface. This observation is peculiarly true of 
the second volume of Mr. Putnam's " Books 
and their Makers." He would be an uninter- 
ested reader indeed who could read this admir- 
able introduction and not be spurred to con- 
tinue ; for in a few swift, comprehensive para- 
graphs the author has summed up the character 
and value of the production and distribution of 
books in the two centuries immediately follow- 
ing the invention of printing. The larger part 
of the volume is taken up with a consideration 
of the men and the literature of the Reforma- 
tion era. 

The Reformation was in part a consequence 
of the Renaissance. The expansion of human 
interest and the spirit of free inquiry engen- 
dered in that period at last led men to ques- 
tion the highest of all authorities of the medi- 
aeval epoch the church. This healthful skep- 
ticism was stimulated by interest in the classics, 
whence scholars worked back to the original 
languages of the Book of Authority. But the 
Reformation was in part also a reaction from 
the Renaissance. The paganism of Renaissance 
Italy finally had penetrated into the secret 
place of authority, the pontificate. Leo X. was 
suspected of averroism, with good reason. 
Again, the Reformation was independent of the 
Renaissance. Early movements for church re- 
form, like those of the Cathari and the Mystics, 
prefigured the spiritual upheaval of the church. 
To Mr. Putnam, naturally enough, the Refor- 
mation is more a continuation of the purely 
intellectual qualities of the Renaissance than 
anything else. In a few excellent pages (pp. 
2734) he points out the far-reaching and re- 
ciprocal influence the invention of printing and 
the Reformation had upon one another. The 
press did more to democratize religion, which 
hitherto had been the possession of the priest- 
class, than any other means. Finally the papacy 
took alarm, for even the people at last came to 
question the authority of the church. The 
Renaissance popes had carried within their own 
bosoms the very weapons which were to strike 
them down. Leo X. was the last papal patron

of letters. His successors discovered how effi- 
cient a means of attack upon them the press 
had become. 

It will readily be seen how great were the 
problems of a publisher in that day. The busi- 
ness was in its formative stage. Mr. Putnam 
says : 

" The business carried on by these early publishers 
differed very materially from that of their successors. 
All the machinery of bookmaking had to be originated 
or created, while it was necessary also to establish chan- 
nels of distribution and through these to discover and 
to educate a reading public which should absorb the pro- 
ductions of the new presses. The task of selecting the 
works which were best adapted for the requirements of 
the first buyers of printed books, of securing trustworthy 
texts of these works, of editing these texts, and of super- 
vising their typesetting, called for a large measure of 
literary judgment and scholarly knowledge, combined 
with a capacity for organising and directing an editorial 
staff. There was also necessity for the gift of imagin- 
ation through which could be pictured literary condi- 
tions and creations, for which as yet there was no prece- 
dent. And finally, steps had to be taken for securing a 
legal status for the new class of property that was being 
brought into existence " (p. 15). 

The last was peculiarly delicate and difficult to 
secure, owing to the large number of small and 
intensely jealous states, especially in Italy and 
Germany, and the suspicion of the church. 
The Estiennes in France, the Kobergers in 
Nuremburg, the Elzevirs and Plan tin of the 
Low Countries, men like these filled the breach 
of new requirement. Their high sense of honor 
and scrupulous integrity as publishers might 
put much of modern publication to the blush. 
Henri Estienne looked upon every error in 
the page as a blemish upon his personal char- 
acter. His sou Robert was accustomed " to 
hang by in the streets or in the precincts of 
the University proof-sheets of important works 
which were passing through his Press, and to 
offer a reward for every error that might be 
discovered" (pp. 21, 31). 

The influence of the Reformation began to 
tell early upon the young publishing business, 
and soon was destined to absorb almost all of 
its publication. It is at this point that the 
subject inevitably reaches beyond the limits 
originally given it. An understanding of the 
Reformation as it progressed in France and 
Germany and England is essential to an ac- 
count of the work of the publisher-printers of 
the epoch. The character of their publications 
was largely determined by their religious and 
political affiliations, and these very works were 
to determine the character and quality of the 
literature of the time. 

Little of this sort of history appears in Mr.

Putnam's pages ; and yet it is essential to his 
plan. He does not even, in order to clear 
the ground before the reader, relieve him of 
the common but erroneous belief that the Ref- 
ormation in France was not a German deriva- 
tive. The French Reformation had its origin 
in France. What it would have become with- 
out Luther, cannot, of course, be determined. 
But it was born of rare spirits in France, and 
was not a German exotic. Luther and Calvin 
were the great captains of the Reformation ; 
but Luther had a French precursor and had 
been anticipated many times in Germany. He 
was not the first cry, nor the only cry of re- 
form ; but he was its clearest, loudest bugle-call. 
In France that note was first sounded by a pro- 
fessor of mathematics and physics in the Uni- 
versity of Paris, Lefevre d'Etaples, who wrote 
in 1508 his " Quincuplex Psalterium," which 
was printed by Henri Estienne. Mr. Putnam 
makes only a meagre and indecisive allusion to 
Lefevre (p. 19). 

Switzerland was the place of refuge for all 
outcast Protestants in the sixteenth century. 
Calvin was the genius and directive force of 
this community. Mr. Putnam does full jus- 
tice to this haughty thinker for at heart Cal- 
vin, like Hildebrand, had a strong sense of his 
own superiority and kept loftily aloof from most 
men. The " Institutes " is characterized as 
"the most important intellectual product of 
the Reformation." It was Robert Estienne 
who had the honor of giving that great work 
to the world. " The publication of this author- 
itative edition of a book which belongs to the 
distinctive literature not only of the sixteenth 
century but of the world's history, was a fitting 
undertaking with which to close the labors of 
the great publisher " (p. 55). The decline of 
the Estienne publishing-house was due partly 
to the fact that the great Estiennes, Henri and 
Robert, left no heir capable of continuing their 
work along the large lines laid down ; partly to 
the political interests which the Calvinist move- 
ment had developed. Moreover, much of the 
prestige of the house had been in the scholar- 
ship of its masters. There could be no second 
" Thesaurus " and no other editor like Henri 
Estienne. The decline was not sudden, but it 
was a decline. 

Perhaps the best exemplification of the dif- 
ficulty which Mr. Putnam has encountered, 
that of an adequate grasp of the history which 
is reflected in the books of which he writes, is 
afforded by the two chapters upon German 
books and bookmakers, " The Kobergers of 



Nuremberg " and " Luther as an Author," at 
once one of the best and one of the weakest 
portions of the book. Events in the moral 
sphere, such as history is, do not take place 
with the suddenness of phenomena in the geo- 
logic world. The Reformation was a slow de- 
velopment, slower in Germany than elsewhere. 
An historian of the Reformation never would 
have written this paragraph, and one wishes 
Mr. Putnam had not : 

" The downfall of imperial Rome, which (irrespective 
of the internal causes) was brought about by persist- 
ent Teutonic onslaughts, terminated the period of the 
world's history which is, for convenience, called classic 
or ancient. In like manner, the overthrow of the world- 
wide domination of ecclesiastical Rome was brought 
about by the attack of the Teuton Luther, an attack 
which, backed by the Teutonic forces of North Europe, 
developed into a revolution against Italian rule and 
terminated the epoch of mediae valism " (p. 240). 

Luther was not the cause of the Reformation, 
but simply its greatest occasion. Hus and 
the Waldenses, Joachim of Flora, Tauler the 
Mystic, and Wesel, who had been professor 
at Erfurt, Luther's own college town, had 
planted and watered Germany. There were 
seventeen editions of the German Bible before 
Luther's translation, fourteen in High German 
and three in the Low German language. Mr. 
Putnam seems to have overlooked this, for he 
says, in writing of the Kobergers : " Two Ger- 
man versions of the Bible had been published 
before this of Koberger in 1483, one in Stras- 
burg and one in Cologne " (p. 159). Perhaps, 
though, Mr. Putnam means by the word " ver- 
sions " to make the distinction into the High 
and Low forms of the language. But even if 
this be the case, there is still an error, for Stras- 
burg was not the only, nor the greatest, place 
of publication of the High German version, 
and Cologne has to divide honor with other 
cities also. But an error greater than this 
occurs in the paragraph immediately before the 

statement made above : 
i 

" In the year 1483, the year in which Luther was 
born, Koberger published his German Bible. The text 
was translated from the Latin of the Vulgate and was 
illustrated with woodcuts. I have not been able to as- 
certain what was the German idiom used for this version, 
but it was a form that never took any permanent place 
in the literature of the country. Luther, referring to 
the Nuremburg Bible, declared that ' no one could speak 
German of this outlandish kind ' " (pp. 158-9). 

In this passage Mr. Putnam has missed the 
essential fact of Luther's claims as an author. 
A practiced historian would have discovered 
the identity of this German idiom which " never 
took any permanent place in the literature of 



50

[Jan. 16, 



the country." As intimated above, there were 
numerous editions of the Bible in the vernac- 
ular before Luther's writing. They were re- 
printed from a Middle High German transla- 
tion from the Latin Vulgate made in the four- 
teenth century by a person or persons unknown. 
This, of course, was prior to the discovery of 
printing, but with the invention of movable types 
the previous manuscript version gained new 
currency. When Koberger, in 1483, printed 
his German Bible* he put upon the press this 
Middle High German version, which then was 
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty 
years old. Luther's criticism, that " no one 
could speak German of that outlandish kind," 
was perfectly just, saving only that the lan- 
guage was not strictly outlandish, but was out 
of date. The Middle High German tongue in 
the fourteenth century had not yet reached its 
term of development. This fact throws light 
upon Luther's true place as a Bible translator. 
He modernized the Bible for the German peo- 
ple of his day, and, owing to his own literary 
skill, the fortunate aid of the press, and the 
growing interest of men in the Bible, he was 
enabled to crystallize the language. The New 
High German of his day was the fullness of 
development of the German language. 

But if Luther did not create the German 
Bible, yet one form of literature, the pamphlet, 
owed its origin and popularity to the stimulus 
he gave to the German mind. Luther's break 
with the humanists had tended to make the 
German Reformation more popular than in 
France where the allegiance of the nobles to 
Calvinism made the movement half aristo- 
cratic. Mr. Putnam has admirably described 
the character and influence of these Flug- 
schriften (pp. 161-2, 221-2, 240). Witten- 
berg caught the most of this profit. The aggre- 
gate of pamphlets for the ten years (1513-23) 
was 3113, half of which was printed in Witten- 
berg. The more dignified and larger works, 
however, were published by the great house of 
Koberger. 

" Koberger's correspondence shows that he had agents 
or active representatives not only in the other book- 
centres of the empire, such as Frankfort, Leipzig, 
Vienna, Basel, Strasburg, and Cologne, but in more dis- 
tant cities, with which business interchange must, dur- 
ing the first years of the sixteenth century, have been 
subject to serious risks and to many interruptions, such 
as Paris, Buda-Pesth, Warsaw, Venice, Florence, Rome, 
Antwerp, Bruges, and Leyden. In this matter of organ- 
izing connections and distributing machinery through- 
out the Continent, Koberger had a decided advantage

Theological Seminary in New York. 



over his great contemporary Aldus, who found ... no 
little difficulty in maintaining permanent satisfactory ar- 
rangements for the distribution of his books north of 
the Alps. Aldus was obliged to depend chiefly upon 
his direct correspondence with individual buyers among 
the scholars of Europe, but Koberger secured larger 
results by utilizing the services of the book trade, the 
organization of which in France and Germany was now 
taking shape. He was himself, in fact, a bookseller as 
well as a publisher and printer, selling both to the book- 
trade and at retail, and he was the first of the book- 
sellers of Germany, and possibly of Europe, to issue a 
classified catalogue of current publications" (p. 151). 

Koberger was fortunate in his time, for he 
printed before the zeal of reform had startled 
the church, and therefore had not to contend 
with authority and censorship. But the great 
concern passed away almost with the death of 
its founder. 

The happiest combination of humanism and 
the ideas of the Reformation was in Erasmus. 
Mr. Putnam has no more entertaining chapter 
than that upon Erasmus. Erasmus is distin- 
guished by one peculiar success in which he is 
superior to many writers even in these days of 
books he was the earliest writer after the 
invention of printing who made a profit by his 
pen. Of the first Basel edition of " The Praise 
of Folly," 1800 copies were sold in six months. 
Latin, German, French, and Dutch versions 
were printed. No less than twenty-seven edi- 
tions were called for during the author's life. 
Froben alone printed 1000 : Aldus, 8000 ; 
Schiirer of Strasburg, 1100 ; Bodius and Phil- 
ippus of Paris, 3000. The " Colloquia " 
reached 24,000 in a term of ten years, the de- 
mand being increased by the rumor that the 
book was to be put upon the Index by the Pope. 
Luther never made any profit from his writings, 
nor did he so seek. Mr. Putnam has a most 
instructive passage upon this question of au- 
thors' honoraria in the sixteenth century, which 
almost tempts quotation (pp. 175-7). 

It is a little remarkable that a man so closely 
identified with the humanists in England should 
have found his publisher in Froben of Basel 
instead of with the successors of Caxton. 
Froben seems to have been like the church in 
Laodicea, neither hot nor cold, in which posi- 
tion of mind conscience and business seem to 
have been blended. 

"After 1520 Froben prints no further books for 
Luther, although it is evident that an assured and 
increasing sale was being secured for these. It is prob- 
able that he was influenced to this decision by the 
counsels of Erasmus and in connection with his relations 
to Leo X. It seems evident that Froben, while not a 
bigoted Romanist, had not been attracted by the doc- 
trines of the Reformers. Irrespective of his long per-

sonal association with Erasmus, it is probable that his 
own scholarly temperament and direction of thought 
would have brought him into sympathy rather with the 
views of the scholar of Rotterdam than with those of 
the Monk of Wittenberg " (p. 191). 

Caxton is too familiar a personage to dwell 
upon here ; and space forbids more than allu- 
sion to the Elzevirs and Plantin. The reader 
may run to Mr. Putnam's work for knowledge 
of them. It is notable for the mass of infor- 
mation gathered together, as well as for the 
presentation thereof. The latter portion of the 
book is taken up with subjects of another sort, 
no more than the titles of which may be indi- 
cated here Italy : Privileges and Censorship ; 
Germany: Privileges and Book-Trade Regu- 
lations ; France : Privileges, Censorship, and 
Legislation ; England : Privileges, Censorship, 
and Legislation ; The Development of the Con- 
ception of Literary Property. The upgrowth 
of press censorship and the history of the Index 
Expurgatorius make an interesting theme, 
and one of which Mr. Putnam is peculiarly 
fitted to write. Liberty of the press and that 
larger liberty not yet wholly realized inter- 
national copyright grew out of the reaction 
against repressive legislation. The author, in 
a sense, has been more at home in the latter 
part of the volume than in the first part. But 
throughout there is evidence of scholarship, 
industry, and that sympathy for his subject 
without which no writer can be at his best. 
Mr. Putnam has been at his best. Palmam

MR. HARE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 

Mr. Hare's autobiography tells the story of 
the greater part of a long and not uneventful 
life. It covers the periods of childhood, youth, 
and early manhood, and closes with the year 
1870, when the author had reached his thirty- 
sixth year and had fairly embarked on his lit- 
erary career. The story of the first and second 
of these periods is told in great detail ; that of 
the third is told in less detail, and, unfortu- 
nately, with less clearness, as its slight thread 
is all but lost in a labyrinth of anecdote and 
reminiscence. It is for this reason that the 
author's account, as it draws to a close, is more 
like a history of men, women, and things, than 
an autobiography.

It will be easily surmised, then, that one 
should look for suggestions as to the true char- 
acter of Mr. Hare in the earlier portion of his 
work, and it may be remarked here that he 
shows an unusual candor in revealing what 
many men would conceal. The strange thing 
about it is that Mr. Hare himself comes out of 
the ordeal unscathed, while his parents, uncles, 
aunts, and other relatives, are less fortunate. 
His attitude toward the associations of his 
youth is one of constant complaint ; and to some 
extent this attitude is justifiable. His early 
training and education were strangely misdi- 
rected. His childhood was passed at a pretty 
country-house called Lime, situated near Hurst- 
monceaux, the former ancestral estate of the 
Hares. Here he grew up under the direction 
of his aunt and adopted mother, Maria Hare, 
a woman of saint-like character, but quite unfit 
to mother the boy she had adopted. It would 
be hard to say whether he was most unfortu- 
nate in his home influences or in his school life. 
After a succession of worthless tutors and 
private schools, he at last, just two years before 
entering Balliol College, Oxford, came under 
the instruction of the Rev. Charles Bradley, a 
most eccentric man, but a thoroughly good 
teacher. The two years spent with him helped 
to make up for the poverty of his previous 
instruction, and to him Mr. Hare always felt 
deeply indebted for the beneficial influence he 
exerted on both his mind and heart. His course 
at Balliol College was begun in 1853 and fin- 
ished in 1857. The college lectures he charac- 
terizes as the "merest rubbish," and of his 
whole education he says : "About fourteen years 
of life and above X4000 I consider to have 
been wasted on my education of nothingness." 

By this time Mr. Hare had begun those voy- 
ages abroad which were to become such an ab- 
sorbing feature of his maturer years. After 
leaving Oxford, in 1857, he passed more ex- 
tended periods on the continent, and thus laid 
the foundation for those entertaining Hand- 
books which the modern traveller in Europe 
finds so indispensable. The first work of the 
kind which he undertook was the " Handbook 
of Berks, Bucks, and Oxfordshire," written for 
John Murray the publisher, which is princi- 
pally worthy of note because it showed him 
what a book of this sort should not be. He 
was required to produce a work which he knew 
would be " utterly unreadable, though correct 
and useful for reference," and it was probably 
owing to his aversion for such work as this that 
he afterwards filled his guide-books with a

wealth of pleasure and instruction. From this 
point on, his life is largely a record of his 
travels, though this record introduces the reader 
to a very large circle of noted men and women 
in England and elsewhere, and carries him 
through much of what is best worth seeing in 
Europe. His vivid descriptions of the scenes 
he visited and his impressions of the people he 
knew may form for some the most entertaining 
portion of his autobiography. 

Among the noted men of whom Mr. Hare 
at one time or another saw a great deal, and 
with whom he was in some cases intimately ac- 
quainted, were Wordsworth, Landor, Sterling, 
Manning, Jowett, Tennyson, Maurice, Ruskin, 
Arnold, and others. He has told interesting 
anecdotes about nearly all of these men, and 
particularly about Landor, with whom he dined 
once a week while the latter was living at Bath 
and he himself was a schoolboy at Lyn combe. 

" Mr. Lander's rooms . . . were entirely covered 
with pictures, the frames fitting close to one another, 
leaving not the smallest space of wall visible. . . . He 
lived alone with his beautiful white spitz dog Pomero, 
which he allowed to do whatever it liked, and frequently 
to sit in the oddest way on the bald top of his head. 
He would talk to Pomero by the hour together, poetry, 
philosophy, whatever he was thinking of, all of it imbued 
with his own powerful personality, and would often roar 
with laughter till the whole house seemed to shake. 
I have never heard a laugh like that of Mr. Landor 
'deep-mouthed Beotian Savage Landor,' as Byron called 
him such a regular cannonade. He was ' the sanest 
madman and the maddest reasonable man in the world,' 
as Cervantes says of Don Quixote. In the evenings he 
would sit for hours in impassioned contemplation; in 
the mornings he wrote incessantly, to fling off sheet 
after sheet for the Examiner, seldom looking them over 
afterwards. He scarcely ever read, for he only pos- 
sessed one shelf of books. If anyone gave him a vol- 
ume he mastered it and gave it away, and this he did 
because he believed that if he was to keep the book and 
be able to refer to it, he should not be able to absorb 
its contents so as to retain them. . . . He never bought 
any new clothes, and a chimneysweep would have been 
ashamed to wear his coat, which was always the same 
as long as I knew him, though it in no way detracted 
from bis majestic and lion-like appearance. But he was 
very particular about his little dinners, and it was about 
these that his violent explosions of passion usually took 
place. I have seen him take a pheasant up by the legs 
when it was brought to table and throw it into the back 
of the fire over the head of the servant in attendance. 
. . . At the same time nothing could be more nobly 
courteous than his manner to his guests, . . . and his 
conversation, whilst calculated to put all his visitors at 
their ease and draw out their best points, was always 
wise, chivalrous, pure, and witty." 

In a letter to his sister, dated May 22, 1864, 
Mr. Hare wrote further regarding Landor : 

" I have seen poor Mr. Landor several times. He 
lias a small lodging in the Via della Chiesa, where he 
' sits out the grey remainder of his evening,' as Cole- 



ridge would describe it. He is terribly altered, has lost 
the use of his hearing and almost of his speech, and 
cannot move from his chair to his bed. . . . When he 
left Villa Landore, it was because Mrs. Landor turned 
him out by main force. It was a burning day, a torrid 
summer sun. He walked on dazed down the dusty road, 
the sun beating on his head. His life probably was 
saved by his meeting Mr. Browning, who took him 
home. . . . Mrs. Story says that nothing ever more com- 
pletely realised King Lear than his appearance when he 
arrived, with his long floating white locks and his wild 
far-away expression." 

When Mr. Hare went to Turin, in 1858, he 
had long talks on art with Ruskin. As a child 
he had always taken great delight in drawing, 
and this youthful devotion to art broadened 
and deepened as he grew into manhood. His 
mother had always counseled him to seek truth 
rather than to strive vaguely after an unattain- 
able excellence. She had also opposed his use 
of color, believing that he had no right to it 
until he could draw perfectly. His earlier work, 
therefore, was usually done in pencil and sepia. 
While they were at Turin, Mrs. Hare gave 
some of her son's drawings to Ruskin to look at. 
" He examined them all very carefully," writes 
Mr. Hare, " and said nothing for some time. 
At last he pointed out one of the cathedrals at 
Perugia as ' the least bad of a very poor col- 
lection.' " Mr. Hare continues : 

" One day in the gallery, I asked him to give me 
some advice. He said, Watch me.' He then looked 
at the flounce in the dress of a maid of honour of the 
Queen of Sheba for five minutes, and then he painted 
one thread : he looked for another five minutes, and then 
he painted another thread. At the rate at which he was 
working he might hope to paint the whole dress in ten 
years ; but it was a lesson as to examining what one drew 
well before drawing it." 

It will be remembered that Coleridge gave 
expression to a similar thought when he said 
that the primary rule and condition for form- 
ing a good style is " not to attempt to express 
ourselves in language before we thoroughly 
know our own meaning." 

The above extracts must serve to illustrate 
one of the entertaining features of these vol- 
umes. Besides these impressions of noted men 
and women, there are a score or more of short 
stories which Mr. Hare has collected from vari- 
ous sources and set down here for the amuse- 
ment of his readers. They are interesting in 
themselves, and some of them would form cap- 
ital plots for novels ; but they detract slightly 
from the unity of the work. There is also an 
unusual profusion of woodcuts and photograv- 
ures, and these add not a little to the pleasure 
one gets from these books.

THE GERMAN STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.* 

Mr. Poultney Bigelow, in his " History of 
the German Struggle for Liberty," has told the 
story of the transformation of Prussia during 
the eight years from the shameful defeat at 
Jena in 1806 to the first abdication of Napoleon. 
The author's opportunity was a great one, for 
no period could be fuller of striking situations 
and contrasts or of interesting personalities, or 
show more clearly the workings of social and 
political forces. These he has developed in a 
striking way, although, by the limitations of 
his plan, somewhat superficially ; but in his 
opportunity lay the danger that has almost un- 
done him. These situations and these person- 
alities have taken hold of him so strongly that 
he is not content to put them before his read- 
ers and let them speak for themselves, but he 
forestalls all exercise of his reader's judgment 
by the constant intrusion of his own, and espe- 
cially by his ever-present adjectives. This may 
please the indolent reader who prefers ready- 
made opinions, but it is annoying to the thought- 
ful one. Another fault is the labored spright- 
liness that at last gets a little monotonous. This 
sometimes leads the author to use expressions 
that are somewhat flippant. The " dignity of 
history " has many sins to answer for, not the 
least of them a deadening dulness, but it would 
keep a writer from using such an expression 
as " a rickety old granny of a general," although 
that description fits the character. It is evident 
that Mr. Bigelow's history is intended for the 
general reader rather than the specialist, and 
as a popular work it is distinctly valuable. A 
hundred will read it where one would undertake 
Seeley's "Life and Times of Stein," and no 
one who is unfamiliar with this period can read 
it without gaining a vivid knowledge of some 
important aspects of the Napoleonic era, or 
without coming upon valuable truths that have 
their application to the Germany of our own 
day. 

The story is cast almost in the form of a 
drama. The heroine is of course Queen Louise, 
beautiful, sweet, heroic. The prime villain 
is Napoleon, whose inherent cruelty, treach- 
ery, vulgarity, and selfishness are made to ap- 
pear on nearly every page. The subordinate 
villain is the Czar Alexander, faithless and 
grasping. The principal hero is the sturdy 
Bliicher unless Stein be put beside him ;

while Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, Jahn and 
Schill, and other patriots, play noble parts. As a 
contrast to these positive characters there is the 
amiable Prussian king whose virtues combined 
with his sentimental weakness were more ruin- 
ous to his country than all the plots and vio- 
lence of his neighbors. The narrative moves 
rapidly and in a rather sketchy manner ; there 
is little of detail except in relation to the queen, 
for whom the author feels an unbounded ad- 
miration that one cannot but share, although 
he tires at length of the adjectives of enthusi- 
asm that accompany every appearance of the 
heroine. 

The author's philosophical point of view is 
that of violent hatred of aristocratic militarism, 
and a whole-hearted belief in the patriotism 
and soundness of the plain people, even of the 
Prussian peasantry that was not till this time 
raised from serfdom by the genius and power 
of Stein. " No man is the worse for good blood 
and thorough education ; but disaster is sure 
to overtake a state which holds that the great 
body of the people is insensible to patriotism, 
courage, and civic virtue. The years of servile 
torment which Germany endured at the hands 
of Napoleon after the battle of Jena should 
make this lesson precious to her, as to all free 
peoples." And the facts the author narrates 
not only support his opinion, but furnish an 
impressive warning to the Germany of to-day, 
where the same old spirit of aristocratic mili- 
tarism seems to be again becoming dominant. 
But the end of the nineteenth century is not 
the beginning ; and the disaster, if it is allowed 
to come, will not result in national subjugation 
and acquiescence, but in the overthrow of the 
haughty aristocracy, and in real popular gov- 
ernment. 

Never was there a more astonishing collapse 
of an apparently great power than that of 
Prussia in 1806. But a generation before, the 
little state had stood almost single-handed 
against the great powers of Europe ; now all 
resistance stopped after one ignominious defeat 
by Napoleon's inferior army ; fortified cities, 
well manned and furnished, were given up one 
after another at the demand of strolling bands 
of Frenchmen ; neither king nor army made a 
single effort to stand against the conqueror. 
And now the selfish and heartless policy Prussia 
had pursued during the past few years brought 
down upon her every humiliation that even the 
malignant ingenuity of Napoleon could devise. 
One's blood boils at reading of it all, even 
though he cannot deny that every insult and

suffering was fully deserved. But out of this 
humiliation and suffering arose a new Prussia, 
whose burning patriotism overthrew the calcu- 
lations of Napoleon, and cooperated with the 
vices and weakness success had developed in 
his own character to bring about his downfall. 
" The Prussian of 1812 was not the Prussian of 1806. 
Queen Louise had lived and died; the spirit of Pestalozzi 
had worked in the common school; the serf had become 
a citizen ; the hireling soldier was now a volunteer; 
Stein and Hardenberg had awaked public confidence in 
the government; Scharnhorst had breathed the new 
spirit into the army; Jahn had taught his athletic clubs 
that patriotism was not a thing to be ashamed of; the 
boys of Prussia sang songs of German unity; the poets 
and preachers of Germany talked of liberty; and the 
boys who were twelve years old at Jena could shoulder 
a musket in the year of grace 1813." 

This transformation is the subject of Mr. Bige- 
low's book ; it does not come within his plan to 
tell how the long-suffering people, after their 
unspeakable sacrifices and sufferings, were de- 
prived of a great part of their reward, while 
the old aristocracy again took control of the 
state that they had ruined. In his preface, 
however, he hints at a continuation of the work. 
We hope that he will feel encouraged by the 
reception of the present volumes to proceed 
without delay. 

These volumes are put forth in excellent 
form, with twenty portraits and many interest- 
ing illustrations. CHARLES H. COOPER. 



TRAVELS IN MANY LANDS.* 



The reader, and still more the reviewer, will 
hardly be conciliated by an author who opens his 
work with the tart remark that " those who are 
interested in me and my travels and observations 
will read them, and the others can leave them alone." 
This remark, from the preface to Mr. Haweis's vol- 
ume of "Travel and Talk," savors more of the 
smartness of the street than of the amenities of the 
literary world. However, the author strikes thus

early the keynote of these volumes to wit, a bump- 
tious bourgeois conceit that is really marvellous. As 
a fine specimen, we extract this : 

" For the third time I enter New York Harbour. No 
one meets me no reporters, no friends. I steal about 
the city for a few hours, almost fearing to meet some 
one who might persuade me to linger but no. I am 
bound for Frisco; it is December 13, and on December 23 
I am to occupy the pulpit of Trinity Church, San Fran- 
cisco, the principal church in the city. My good Fran- 
cisco friends, as soon as they knew I was coming West 
in search of health, opened, as I may say, their hearts, 
homes, and churches to me. More than one pulpit was 
at my disposal, but the Trinity Church Committee pre- 
vailed, and secured me for two months. I was to preach 
every Sunday night." 

And, worst of all, Mr. Haweis is not unconscious of 
his egotism ; for after one exhibition of it, he re- 
marks : " But I feel the reader has a right to resent 
this egotistical digression ; let him resent and pass 
on." It is hard to speak with patience of two vol- 
umes of experiences in America and Australasia, 
all recorded in this vein of pugnacious and caustic 
conceit ; but it is certainly about the most nauseat- 
ing farrago we have ever tasted. The travel is mere 
globe-trotting and the talk mere chit-chat, and over 
all is writ an immense I. 

It is a great relief to turn from the rasping, stac- 
cato, egotistic manner of Mr. Haweis to the gentle, 
graceful, modest style of Mrs. Louise Chandler 
Moulton in her " Lazy Tours in Spain and Else- 
where." In these impressions of journeyings in cen- 
tral and southern Europe, Mrs. Moulton has, to be 
sure, only commonplaces to relate ; but, having the 
true literary touch, she beguiles us into reading with 
zest. One of the pleasantest sketches is the " Lazy 
Tour in Spain," from which we extract this anecdote 
about a little beggar boy whom she kindly instructed 
in the English language. 

" With pennies I bribed him to say, ' I am a very bad 
little boy.' He said the words slowly and solemnly, as 
if they were an incantation, without the most distant 
idea of their meaning; and I heard him, weeks after- 
ward, startling subsequent visitors to the Cathedral with 
this formula." 

Mrs. Moulton shows a real imaginative power, when, 
upon revisiting Nuremburg, and looking up to the 
tall mediaeval houses with their eye-shaped windows,

she says: "The same eyes look furtively at me 
from the many-storied roofs ; the old houses nod 
sagaciously at each other across the narrow streets." 

Another book of sketches is Mr. H. C. Chatfield- 
Taylor's " The Land of the Castanet." It is largely 
a reprint of papers in " The Cosmopolitan," giving 
a light and agreeable account of the impressions of 
a tourist in Madrid, Seville, Granada, and Gibraltar, 
with some remarks on Spanish history, society, 
sport, the peasantry, and provincial towns. There 
is little that is new or of remarkable interest ; but 
such chapters as those on " Provincial Towns " and 
" The Common People " contain some pleasant de- 
scription. The style is quite fluent and correct, 
though we note occasional slips in English usage, as 
when the author speaks of Barcelona as having its 
" American prototype " in Chicago. The little vol- 
ume is shapely, and has the attractive appearance 
which characterizes its publisher's books. 

Another book on Spain, but of somewhat higher 
quality, is " On the Trail of Don Quixote," by Mr. 
A. F. Jaccaci. This work records, in a dainty and 
graphic style, the impressions of an itinerary through 
the province of La Mancha, " the most backward 
region in Spain," "arid, savage, Moorish." The 
Manchegans the author finds to be 
" Half Moors, who, like the natives of Southern Italy, 
are born for finessing. . . . After learning, what they 
already knew, that I was a stranger (a term which ap- 
plies to anyone not a Manchegan), they dangled a variety 
of bait that should tempt me to disclose what manner of 
man I was and what I had come for. One imagines 
that if cats could, they would talk in just the way these 
people did slowly, with the same imperturbable glare 
in their fixed, brilliant eyes." 

The author visited Argamasilla, the Cave of Mon- 
tesinos, El Toboso, and other spots made forever 
famous by the adventures of the knight of the rue- 
ful countenance, and he feels that 
" On his native soil Cervantes' book takes an added 
pungency. How much it is of the country, how true to 
life are the characters, description, and language, one 
needs to live here among the people to know. There is 
a great charm in stumbling at all instants on things it 
has made familiar to us. For example, not only do the 
inhabitants of certain villages of La Mancha dress to-day 
like Sancho Panza, but all Manchegans are mines of 
old sayings in which the wisdom of generations is crys- 
talized into proverbs which, like him, they constantly 
use to sum up tersely a situation." 

The author's graceful prose is fully supplemented 
by the delicate drawings of Vierge, so full of lights 
and air, and indeed, we notice that in views of 
interiors the open door is always emphasized. 

"On the Broads," by Anna Bowman Dodd, is a 
sketch of a yachting trip along the manifold water- 
ways of the Bure and Yare rivers, which, now nar- 
rowing, now broadening, run through the level 
stretch of land between Norwich and the sea known 
as " the Broads." Here in summer cruise yachts, 
wherries, barges, and yawls innumerable, freighted 
with English pleasure-seekers of both high and low 



degree. The story of a fortnight's trip is well told 
in a quietly humorous vein. An abundance of bright 
conversation, some mild adventure, and a bit of 
flirtation lure the reader to the very end. A main 
point of view is the aesthetic, and there are many 
pleasant word-pictures of placid English landscape 
and simple folk. Some of Mr. Pennell's drawings 
are poorly printed, and as a whole they are hardly 
up to his usual mark. 

" In the Volcanic Eifel " is another book of Eu- 
ropean travel ; but it has the advantage, unlike the 
sketchy book we have just noted, of treating only 
of a single and small section of country. In Rhen- 
ish Prussia, between the Rivers Rhine, Moselle, and 
Rohr, is a high plateau known as the Eifel, the 
southern part of which, being dotted with ancient 
lava-beds and lake-filled craters, is called the " Vol- 
canic Eifel." Though this section has long been 
studied by the geologist, it has been but little fre- 
quented by the tourist. Yet travellers will find in 
this book a pleasant introduction to a quite unique 
region. The work contains maps, a table of dis- 
tances, and numerous illustrations in the form of 
well-executed drawings. 

Miss H. Ellen Browning opens her book, " A 
Girl's Wanderings in Hungary," with a personal 
confession which is a fair sample of the author's 
style, and which will doubtless attract some read- 
ers and repel others. 

" To begin with, let me confess that I belong to the 
category of ' mouse-screeching ' women; though I wear 
cloth knickers under my gown, and feel equally con- 
temptuous towards an hysterical female ' and a dowdy 
bas bleu. Their day is over. I love the sea and the 
mountains, and the frank naturalness ' of the peasantry, 
but garlic and drunken men both disgust me. Swear- 
ing frightens me, particularly when there's anything 
' bluggy ' about it. It turns me instantly into a mass of 
shivering goose-flesh: perhaps it's the tone that does it 
quite as much as the words." 

This book reminds one of " A Girl in the Carpa- 
thians," although not quite the equal for cleverness 
and vividness. But Miss Browning makes the most 
of her mild adventures in an entertaining way, and 
there is much pleasant description of wayside life 
in the mediaeval recesses of Hungary. 

With Robert Howard Russell's The Edge of 
the Orient " we return to the rambling sketch type 
of travel books now so common. Mr. Russell trips 
lightly along Adriatic Austria, by maritime Turkey, 
with a side visit to Damascus, and ends with a 
rapid run through Egypt; and his main search 
everywhere is for the picturesque in costumes, archi- 
tecture, and landscape, in which he is to some extent 
rewarded. Perhaps the best description in the book 
is of a view from Ragusa: 

" On a bare, isolated rock, toward the north of Ra- 
gusa, towers the grim old fortress of San Lorenzo; and 
beyond, on a little point stretching into the sea, is the 
luxuriant garden of the Conte Pozza, with its bowers 
of roses and its wealth of tropical vegetation. Farther 
on, toward the northwest, a little group of rocky islands,

which turn to purple shadows in the sunset, lift their 
heads above the sea. Nowhere in the world is there a 
more beautiful view, and nowhere in the world is there 
a more perfect example of an old mediaeval town, with 
ancient walls and great battlements, deep moats and 
strong towers, drawbridges and sally ports, from which, 
so visionary does it all seem, you half expect to see a 
goodly company of King Arthur's knights ride forth on 
the quest of the Holy Grail." 

In parts of this work we find too much history of 
the guide-book order. There is nothing of adven- 
ture, unless we except the author's amusingly auda- 
cious call on the Mushir of Damascus. The hook 
has no map, but contains numerous illustrations of 
interest. 

Of still smaller calibre than the previous work 
is Mr. A. P. Terhune's " Syria from the Saddle." 
This is a rather careless and flippant account, in 
a gossippy journalistic style, of horseback excur- 
sions in various parts of Syria. However, the au- 
thor's unconventional point of view lends a new 
aspect to some common experiences, and there are 
some entertaining stories. Of these, quite the best 
is the account of a visit to a Latin monastery, where 
Mr. Terhune conversed in French with the Superior. 

" We were interrupted by an Italian brother, who 
leaned toward me with a wink, and said in English, 
' Yes? Good morning ! If you please ! Damn T ' I 
was surprised to hear this string of expressions in my 
own tongue, and still more so on hearing the pleasantly 
uttered curse. After looking about in pride at his own 
linguistic power, and noting the effect on the other 
brethren, the holy man relapsed into French, and said 
complacently, I have met Englishmen and Americans 
before, and, as you observe, I have learned a little of 
their language. What I just said is one of your forms 
of greeting, is it not ? ' " 

Of the English penetration of the Sudan from 
the northeast we have of late heard much, and but 
very little of the French inroad from the northwest. 
M. Felix Duhois supplies this lack in his "Tim- 
huctoo the Mysterious," which tells in sprightly 
Gallic fashion the story of a trip to the Queen City 
of the Sudan, and adds thereto a valuable histor- 
ical account. Timbuctoo is a name surrounded by 
a glamour of barbaric magnificence, which for M. 
Dubois was rudely dispelled on finding it a mass of 
ruinous mud houses and straw huts, and its inhab- 
itants clothed in rags. But he soon discovered that 
this dilapidation was an appearance only ; within 
these ruins were riches and luxury. The inhabitants 
have for many years been so plagued by the pillag- 
ing nomads of the desert that " they transformed 
their garments and dwellings, and, ceasing to be 
Timbuctoo the Great, they became Timbuctoo the 
Mysterious." Timbuctoo is the entrepot to Sudan. 

" Placed as she is at the outlet of a labyrinth of trib- 
utaries, creeks, and channels, at the point where the 
Niger bends abruptly from the western to its eastern 
course, she offers an easy point of concentration to north 
and south. Here the Sudan can assemble her many 
different products, and satisfy all her clients of the 
north at the same time. Timbuctoo is like a port with 



bonded docks situated on the coast of an opulent conti- 
nent, with a sea of sand stretching before her upon 
which the fleets of the desert come and go." 

M. Dubois's route was down the Niger, and he was 
greatly impressed by this wonderful river. As 
Egypt is the " gift of the Nile," so the French Sudan 
is the gift of the Niger. 

" A most thorough and complete system of irrigation 
is formed to which man has not needed to put his hand; 
and fertility is spread over thousands of square miles. 
The rise and fall of the waters is as regular as those of 
the Nile, and an infinitely greater distance is covered. 
At Mopti, for example, you can calculate in September 
ninety miles from east to west inundated to a depth of 
eight or nine feet." 

M. Dubois has much also to say of the strange city 
of Jenne on the Niger, which still retains the archi- 
tecture of Ancient Egypt and many elements of 
that civilization. The book contains numerous useful 
maps and illustrations, and is fairly well translated. 

" Madagascar before the Conquest," by the Rev. 
James Sibree, is practically an edition, brought 
down to the late French Conquest, of the author's 
very good work entitled " The Great African 
Island." Some footnotes revise to 1896. Though 
to some extent a general account, it yet has special 
reference to the capital city and its province, and to 
the Hova tribe. While the missionary point of 
view is evident, it is not over-emphasized, but much 
information of all kinds is summarized on the cli- 
mate, zo5logy, botany, geography, customs, language, 
folk-lore, etc. While not technical nor very thorough, 
the treatment appears to be fairly accurate. The 
style is quite commonplace. While the book is 
evidently designed for information rather than enter- 
tainment, a chapter on "Odd and Curious Experi- 
ences of Madagasy Life " has some diverting pas- 
sages as, for instance, the description of a village 
church, built entirely on native plans, whose interior 
decoration had evidently been suggested by a stray 
ace of clubs. 

Mr. S. J. Stone's " In and Beyond the Hima- 
layas " is a sketch of various sporting trips after big 
game in the mountain fastnesses to the north of 
India. The author evidently delights not in butch- 
ery, but appears to be a true sportsman ; and hav- 
ing a genuine interest in wild animals, he records 
some very good observations on their habits. We 
quote a description of ibex vigilance : 

"The most wide-awake animal in creation is cer- 
tainly the female ibex, and she seems to exercise her 
vigilence solely for the benefit of the ungrateful male, 
who is by no means so watchful ; in fact, if he is old 
and lazy, he keeps no lookout at all after having com- 
fortably laid himself up for the day. That duty falls 
to his mate, and admirably she performs it, uncomfort- 
ably perched on a jutting rock far above the rest of the 
flock, securely sleeping on some soft patch of level or 
gently sloping ground below, she lies keeping her tire- 
less watch. The patient native or Kashmiri is used to 
her sentry duty, and after taking in the situation, he 
too falls asleep like the bearded males he is trying to 
circumvent ; but the impatient Saxon fumes and swears

in tbe intervals of studying the little animal through his 
glasses. The case is perfectly hopeless; there is no 
nearer approach than a thousand yards, without instant 
detection for several hours to come at any rate ; and 
the language that contaminates the mountain air is truly 
awful." 

Among the animals which fell before the author's 
rifle were wild goats, especially the long horns, wild 
sheep, bear, yak, and musk deer. The story of the 
chase is told in the blunt British style. The illus- 
trations by Mr. Wbymper are excellent. 

In " A Cycle of Cathay " we find a book which is 
decidedly not of a sketchy order, but a careful and 
thorough-going account by a competent author, Dr. 
W. A. P. Martin, veteran missionary, linguist, and 
diplomatist. Dr. Martin has been for forty years 
in direct touch with the process which has opened 
China to the world, and his reminiscences have 
much historical value. His remarks on the future 
of China are worth considering. He says that " the 
Russians are as confident of one day possessing 
Peking as they are of getting Constantinople. ' I 
expect to live to be governor of Pechili ' (the metro- 
politan province), said a young Russian in my hear- 
ing, at a legation dinner, or rather after dinner 
in vino verltas" Dr. Martin regards opium- 
smoking as the great curse of China to-day, and 
this opinion has evidently been formed upon long 
and unbiased observation. Much of the volume is 
no less interesting than instructive, particularly the 
author's reminiscences of his early experiences as 
preacher and his capture by pirates. While this is 
by no means a monumental monograph, it is yet a 
distinct addition to the literature on China. 

" Dragons and Cherry-Blossoms," by Mrs. Robert 
C. Morris, is a light and chatty book depicting 
Japanese life from a very feminine point of view, as 
in the descriptions of shopping, servants, meals, and 
costumes. While Mrs. Morris does not, in her very 
brief account, add distinctly to our knowledge of 
things Japanese, she yet gives her impressions in a 
fresh and natural style that is pleasing. There is 
much that is entertaining, as, for instance, this 
description of a Japanese swell : 

" I once saw an enthusiastic and progressive Jap 
walking stolidly through the streets with a small stiff 
bat perched on the back of his head, with his kimono 
turned up in the back, disclosing a pair of flannel under- 
drawers, white stockings, and laced American shoes, the 
whole gracefully consummated by a cane, which he swung 
jauntily as he marched along. The conscious pride that 
he took in this outfit was something delightful to see, 
and the serious and possibly envious glances showered 
upon him by his friends showed that he was a centre of 
admiration." 

The volume is prettily illustrated and manufactured. 

" Town and Bush," by Mr. Nat Gould, is a little 
book chiefly concerned with town life in Australia. 
The author is an English journalist, for many years 
a resident in Australia, and well known there as the 
author of several sporting novels. The style is far 
from refined, and the author sometimes seems to be 



a follower of Mark Twain at a long distance. 
However, the volume conveys a certain amount of 
information in a smart, dashing way, not uninter- 
esting, though scarcely attaining the dignity of lit- 
erature. 

Who that has read Robert Louis Stevenson's 
" Travels with a Donkey " has not felt that here was 
a master of travel-writing ? From the most meagre 
materials, Stevenson, by the magic of his style, cre- 
ated a charming book. And what more attractive 
subject could Stevenson have than the South Seas ! 
We open the volume with eager expectations of de- 
light, and we close it in disappointment. The pecu- 
liar beauty of Stevenson's style is almost lacking in 
this book. Here indeed, Stevenson is more sociol- 
ogist than stylist ; and, further, it would seem that 
the touch of mortal illness had numbed his powers. 
And yet, though we gain little artistic pleasure from 
the book, we find much of interest in the realistic 
descriptions of life in the South Seas, of a dying 
race and decaying customs, of funerals, festivals, 
and daily life ; and the impression is far from pleas- 
ant. Stevenson's descriptions of nature are also of 
interest, and these few sentences from his impres- 
sions of the Fakarava atoll have a vivid and sombre 
power. 

" I lay down to sleep, and awoke again with an un- 
blunted sense of my surroundings. I was never weary 
of calling up the image of that narrow causeway, on 
which I had my dwelling, lying like a serpent tail to 
mouth, in the outrageous ocean, and I was never weary 
of passing a mere quarter-deck parade from one side 
to the other, from the shady, habitable shores of the 
lagoon to the blinding desert and uproarious breakers 
of the opposite beach. The sense of insecurity in such 
a thread of residence is more than fanciful. Hurricanes 
and tidal- waves over-leap the humble obstacles : Oceanus 
remembers his strength, and, where houses stood and 
palms flourished, shakes his white beard again over the 
barren coral."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



" The Complete Bachelor " ( Apple- 
The Bachelor's ton ) j 8 a treat i se on "Manners for 

own manners-book. _, / ,,, , , p , ~ 

JNLen, by the author of the " As been 
by Him " papers, whoever he may be. The term 
"complete bachelor" embodies, in our view, a con- 
tradiction of terms, but we will not carp at so small 
a matter when dealing with a book that has occa- 
sioned us so much joy. So many knotty problems 
are solved for us, so much helpful counsel given, 
that gratitude must be the note of our criticism. 
Why, one does not get half-a-dozen pages into the 
volume before coming upon this salutary admoni- 
tion : "A gentleman will never be seen in public 
with characters whom he could not introduce to his 
mother or his sister." Could anything be neater or 
more moral than that? "In a chest with four 
drawers, the bottom one should be used for under-

clothes, the top for handkerchiefs, hose, and ties, 
and the two intermediate for linen." It is very com- 
forting to know this, and doubtless many a bachelor, 
hitherto incomplete, will rise up to bless the writer 
who has saved him from the solecism of putting his 
linen in the lower drawer. " The pivotal points of 
a man are his hat, boots, and tie." This is not quite 
the idea of the poet, who admits that 

" Virtue may flourish in an old cravat," 
but poet and prosateur seemingly agree in the 
proviso : 

" But man and nature scorn a shocking hat." 

One bit of advice, " Remember, do not be a lingerer 
or a sitter," deserves immortality among the coun- 
sels of Polonius. How easily it would fit into the 

metre 

" Neither a lingerer nor a sitter be." 

Here are two sterling sentences that are alone 
worth the price of the book : " There are no rules as 
to how a man should ask a woman to be his wife." 
" There is no code of etiquette established as yet 
for divorce." One is apt to exclaim in either case, 
" If there only were ! " But the world moves, and 
the inquirer of the twentieth century will doubtless 
have a system of conduct formulated for his use 
upon these critical occasions. We must, however, 
pause to ask what these two pronouncements are 
doing in a book that professes to show the path for 
complete bachelorhood to take. Their purpose may 
be merely minatory, hinting at the dangers that 
always await him who departs from the ways that 
are properly hedged in by conventional codes. 
There is one dark paragraph devoted to the after- 
noon suit, the mystery of which we have been un- 
able to fathom. Here it is : " The afternoon suit 
is more or less a luxury. Unless you frequent after- 
noon teas, or make many afternoon calls, or act as 
an usher at weddings in any city but New York, 
the frock coat is not, for the first three or four years 
of your career, an absolute necessity. In New York, 
however, where calls are only made in the after- 
noon, it must form a part of your wardrobe." We 
had a horrid suspicion while reading this book that 
the author might be " Ruth Ashmore " in disguise ; 
but the last page sufficed to dispel it. Ruth would 
never have admitted that " under great provocation 
the expletive ( damn ' is tolerated by society, but it 
should be whispered and not pronounced aloud." 
When we came to that passage, we closed the book 
with a sigh of satisfaction, for we knew that we had 
been communing with a man and a brother. 

It is not an easy task to speak ade- 
q atel y of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps's 
" Chapters from a Life " ( Houghton) ; 
but, fortunately, it is not really necessary to do so. 
The chapters were read in a widely circulating peri- 
odical before they appeared in book form, so that 
the general reader is already pretty well aware of 
them. And even beyond the circle reached by 
" McClure's Magazine," in that larger circle of the 
admirers of "The Gates Ajar" and "A Singular 



Life," there is little need of information concerning 
this autobiography, because it is exactly what one 
might readily have expected it to be. When one 
assures the public that admires Mrs. Ward that it 
will not be disappointed in her last book, enough 
has been said as far as mere information is con- 
cerned. If, however, it be thought the duty of a 
critical journal to render a judgment (and nowadays 
there seems to be some doubt on this matter), if one 
must really place the work for posterity, we have 
no such easy performance. To concentrate difficulty 
and achievement into one consummate moment, into 
one triumphant epigram, we might say that this 
book should have been named " Chapters from an 
Unwritten Life." Chapters we have, and interest- 
ing ones too, concerning Andover, Boston, Glou- 
cester ; concerning old companions on the Hill and 
later friends in the world of letters ; concerning vari- 
ous experiences, struggles, triumphs ; much about 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, a noted literary figure in 
her day, but as to Life, in any real sense of the 
word, of herself or of anybody else, there is no more 
here than in any of Mrs. Ward's other books. Mrs. 
Ward is still, as she always has been, an idealist of 
the old school, the school of Ouida on the one hand 
and Ruskin on the other ; an idealist of the kind 
that is sternly opposed to the realist with an impas- 
sable bar between, an idealist before the fact. All 
the literary surgings and seethings of the last twenty- 
five years, those cataclysms which have raised up 
continents unknown and submerged what was once 
solid ground, the slow development amid jarring 
chaos of Naturalism into what we suppose is called 
neo-Idealism, all this has left Mrs. Ward as it 
found her, one who nursed lovely and noble dreams 
which rarely failed to reach the hearts of those 
unbucklered by the triple shield of a literary sense. 
From her first great success, the expression of her 
visions of fulfilled desire, to her last, in that melo- 
drama of " the new theology," Mrs. Ward has writ- 
ten steadfastly by faith ; her work is the substance 
of things she has hoped for, the assurance of things 
she has never seen. Of such a literary life, this 
autobiography is a faithful record ; and therefore 
our triumphant epigram must be acknowledged 
wholly wrong, for nowhere could we get a truer 
idea of Mrs. Ward than here. The book has her 
weakness, and her strength too ; it has no place in 
literature, but will find one in many hearts ; it will 
doubtless be sniffed at by the critics, while the com- 
mon people will read it gladly. 

The books that have done most in 
The initiation stimulating the literary instinct of 

mto " Culture. 1 ' . . . . , 

the world, that have been preeminent 
guides to those who are careful as to self-cultivation, 
were written with slight idea of serving what turned 
out to be their de facto usefulness. Books written 
especially to superinduce culture are rarely so for- 
tunate as these subjects of a happy diversion. In- 
deed, we suppose that many would believe that the 
best disposition of temperament must be always so

THE DIAL 



largely the result of environment, that self-cultivation 
alone can rarely attain even a respectable result. 
Without offering an opinion on this difficult matter, 
we mention it as being suggested by Mr. H. W. 
Mabie's " Essays on Books and Culture " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), for here we have a book written with 
the distinct purpose of being, we might almost say, 
a technical guide to a very difficult art, and yet hav- 
ing much of the fortunate air of those dispensers 
of involuntary education of whom we first spoke. 
We conceive this to be the chief and almost the 
sufficient thing for the reviewer to say of the book, 
more especially as half the essays have already ap- 
peared in one of the magazines. But although a 
collection of magazine articles is too often merely 
a gathering of what were better left where it fell, 
these magazine articles are vastly improved by be- 
coming, as they really have become, a book. We 
were a little surprised to see how much the separate 
essays gained, in being put each into its place in the 
scheme and development of the author. As to the 
main point, then, the book is distinctly successful : 
we think it should do for many the service of initi- 
ation which it intends, nor will it be harmful to those 
no longer neophytes in the sacred hierarchy of cul- 
ture. On some minor matters we disagree with Mr. 
Mabie heartily, and sometimes these minor matters 
grow in our mind to inordinate importance. For 
instance, there are times when we cannot think with 
equanimity of one who speaks of " the kind of reading 
which secures culture," or of " the culture element " 
in anything. Mr. Mabie's views on culture (poor 
word with hateful and complacent currency thrust 
upon it) are so sound and vital that we cannot form 
of him the impression we should form of some 
others who use such locutions. When we add that 
Mr. Mabie speaks of "production along spiritual 
and artistic lines," or of putting oneself " into heart- 
relations " with something or other, that he does not 
object to writing " gotten " or " in this connection," 
it will be seen that in discerning the really fine 
quality of his ideas we have penetrated far beyond 
the hulls and patches with which he now and then 
sees fit to guard himself from the style-hating pop- 
ulace, to whom his book offers a means of reform- 
ing from the error of their disposition. 

Scholarship is still to-day, as it has 
always been, too much an affair of 
books. True, Bacon called attention 
to the fact that Nature had secrets also ; but students 
have been apt to seek for those secrets in rather an 
indoor fashion. The student is too often a man of 
books alone. He used to sit in his pensive citadel 
amid dusty tomes and huge folios, while now he 
moves briskly about in vast libraries, consulting neat 
little dissertations and endless monographs once 
books, now pamphlets ; still, in the catalogue all may 
go as books. Ever has there been, however, a thin 
trickle of tradition and fancy about the thought of 
books and nature too. And this idea is the motive 
of Mr. John Buchan's " Scholar Gipsies " (Mac- 



Scholarship 
and Nature. 



millan), a book named from the first of the sixteen 
essays which hold together through being " contin- 
uations and exemplifyings of the conception of the 
art of life contained in the first essay and the title 
of the volume." Such a volume should be read with 
pleasure and profit by many; the gipsy element 
will be good for the scholar, the scholarly element 
may improve the gipsy. Probably the scholar will 
benefit most : in many of the essays the balance has 
gone as far to Nature as with many of us it goes in 
the other direction. There are a good many essays 
wherein the gipsy element flourishes alone, essays 
on country works and days by Tweedside. The 
highest praise to be given to such a book, Mr. 
Buchan's volume can hardly achieve ; it gives us 
no new instinct wherewith to enjoy nature and no 
new sense of the possibilities of life. Charming 
atmosphere, charming description and meditation, 
yet weigh it over against the severely practical (as 
a really fine book can be weighed) and it seems just 
a little light. That is to say, the book pleases, but 
we are much the same after reading it as before. 
Mr. Buchan is evidently impractical, as everyone 
should be ; but he is not practical, too, as a great 
man of letters is. This fact he indicates in his essay 
on " Nature and the Art of Words." Here he had 
something definite to talk about ; here the scholar 
should for the moment have kept the gipsy under, 
just so long at least as to allow him to say some- 
thing by himself. But such was not the case, and 
we have a summer's-day meandering about the sub- 
ject, for all the world as though 'twere a hillside 
in Peeblesshire. 

The old-fashioned phrase, "obliged 

KSSS. the town '" or here more p r p erl y 

" the public," may well be used of 
Mrs. Fields in speaking of her book " Authors and 
Friends " (Houghton). Mrs. Fields has a fund of 
recollection and experience such as can belong to 
few others, and since it largely concerns people of 
whom everyone is delighted to hear, her volume 
will be eagerly read by many. Such a book is not 
to be considered as criticism ; we do not expect 
any revision of opinion concerning Emerson, Long- 
fellow, Tennyson ; what we expect, what is enough 
for us, is to share in a delightful personal intimacy 
with some distinguished men of letters. To tell the 
truth, people do not at present seem so eager to 
form opinions as to the value of this one or that ; we 
want personal details, little memoranda of private 
life, literary gossip. But this last word, although 
none too harsh for current popular tendencies, is not 
to be rightly applied to the book in hand. Mrs. 
Fields herself calls attention to the value of minor 
matters concerning great lives " which, if omitted, 
would leave a gap in the picture. Therefore," she 
goes on, "we never tire of 'Whisperings,' and 
' Talks ' and ' Walks ' and ' Letters ' relating to the 
friends of our imagination, if not of our fireside ; 
and in so far as such fragments bring men and 
women of achievement nearer to our daily life, with-

out degrading them, they warm and cheer us with 
something of their own beloved and human pres- 
ence." We think, on the whole, that Mrs. Fields is 
right. One does gain a certain warmth of personal 
feeling from these recollections, letters, diaries, and 
all of the what-not-else of personal life. One gains 
a personal feeling, which, though it would tend to 
impertinence were it concerning current popular- 
ities, receives a certain dignity and recognition from 
the august figures of those who are its object. We 
need not comment upon the essays by themselves, 
for they are for the most part already known from 
their appearance in the magazines. Longfellow, 
Emerson, Holmes, Whittier, who were more the 
intimates of James T. Fields than of his wife, Mrs. 
Stowe and Mrs. Thaxter, who stood rather nearer 
to her, and Tennyson and Lady Tennyson, are the 
subjects of the eight essays. 

An admirable Professor Benjamin W. Wells has 
hand-book of written a " Modern French Litera- 
French literature. ture ^ & companion volume to his 
" Modern German Literature " of a year or two ago 
(Roberts). The plan of the work comprises a rapid 
survey, in three introductory chapters, of French lit- 
erature up to the nineteenth century, and a detailed 
study of that literature from Madame de Stael and 
Chateaubriand to such writers of our own day as M. 
Daudet, M. Brunetiere, and Yerlaine. In the chap- 
ters that make up the greater part of the book, " no 
mention is made of imitators or hack writers, however 
ephemerally popular, nor of any work that has not 
literary imagination and artistic form, in order that 
attention may be concentrated on those writers who 
stand for something, who mark progress or change." 
" In estimating their place and function," the author 
goes on to say, " I have used freely the critical ap- 
paratus cited in the footnotes, but I have never ex- 
pressed a literary opinion that is not based on exam- 
ination of the original work." Thus far Professor 
Wells has been left to speak for himself. For our 
part, we will first testify to the evident sincerity 
and conscientiousness with which his work has been 
done, and add that he shows himself to be possessed 
of the critical faculty in a high degree. The author's 
knowledge of his subject is wide and accurate, his 
instinct for good literary workmanship is sound, 
and his judgments are deserving of respect. More- 
over, the material thus brought together from many 
different sources is of just the sort that a student of 
modern literature wants, and often finds it difficult 
to get at. We have little to say of the book in the 
way of adverse criticism. We are inclined to sug- 
gest that the author does not seem quite fair to 
Hugo ; there are no doubt spots enough on that sun, 
but recent criticism has made too much of them, 
and Professor Wells has taken the reaction against 
Hugo a little too seriously. But upon this subject, 
as upon others, the judgments of the author are de- 
livered without dogmatism, and are so well-reasoned, 
so fortified by citation of chapter and verse, that 
they always command respect, if they do not always 



compel entire acquiescence. The work is a note- 
worthy contribution to the literature of sane criti- 
cism of the academic type. 

The object of Miss Florence P. 
* 1 Holden's Audiences " (McClurg) 

is to help people in general to form 
their artistic tastes to the point of appreciating good 
work. The word " audiences " is an attempt to till a 
gap in our language. We have borrowed such words 
as connoisseur, amateur, dilletante, to indicate a 
person especially interested in one or another art. 
But that was in an aristocratic period ; art is now 
for the millions ; we need a word more widely ap- 
plicable. Mr. Marshall, in his " ^Esthetic Princi- 
ples," used the word " observer," and this word 
seems to us rather better than " audience," for of 
the five commonly reckoned fine arts, three are 
always apprehended by the eye, while only one is 
usually apprehended by the ear ; literature may 
stand aside, now that bards no longer recite their 
own works. But neither word is quite the thing, 
and the problem still remains for the ingenuity of 
the sesthetician. When, however, the author adds 
the sub-title, " A few suggestions to those who look 
and listen," the right point is touched, for the phrase 
is exactly descriptive of the book. There is, of 
course, a place for a book which shall put the fine 
arts in their right relation to the world that might 
enjoy them : the new-born kitten-like tumblings of 
too many of our art clubs and literary clubs are 
proof enough of that. But we rather fear that the 
present volume will not fill the want : the author 
does not appear to have an accurate estimate of the 
needs of those for whom she is writing ; we cannot 
comfortably imagine the result it may have on the 
average American who reads it, thinking that she 
will thereby become more appreciative. We do not 
regard Miss Holden as especially well-informed 
upon the subject she treats, although this is a 
minor matter, for many people who do not know 
very much about painting, for example, could tell 
us a good deal that would help us to enjoy pictures. 
Some suggestive remarks the book has, and several 
excellent illustrations, besides being pleasantly 
printed and bound. 

The principle* " A First Book of Jurisprudence for

jurisprudence. (Macmillan), by Sir Frederick Pol- 
lock, " is addressed to readers who have laid the 
foundations of a liberal education and are beginning 
the special study of law." For such readers the 
book must have great value ; but we are inclined 
to add that it will be found to have equal value to 
readers who are sufficiently intelligent to appreciate 
its masterly analysis of the common law, but who 
have no intention of adopting the legal profession. 
Certainly a knowledge of political science in the 
widest sense of that term is a necessary part of any 
education that deserves to be called liberal, and 
equally certainly the knowledge of political institu-

tutions and of economics which most well-educated 
persons possess ought to be rounded out by an ele- 
mentary acquaintance with the principles of English 
jurisprudence. That it is not as a rule so rounded 
out, is due to the fact that the books have been lack- 
ing; and so we welcome Sir Frederick Pollock's 
treatise as supplying a real want. The book has 
two sections, one upon " Some General Legal No- 
tions," the other upon " Legal Authorities and Their 
Use." In the former section we have discussions 
of such matters as "the nature and meaning of law," 
"things, events, and acts," and "justice according 
to law." In the second we find chapters on such 
subjects as " custom in English law," " law reports," 
and " ancient and modern statutes." The extra- 
ordinary ability of the work, its fine literary style, 
and its philosophical temper, commend it to the 
judicious, and would justify almost any measure of 
praise. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



To the steadily lengthening list of the " Story of the 
Nations " series (Putnam) is now added a volume on 
Bohemia, by Mr. C. E. Maurice, whose historical work 
is already favorably known. Though necessarily com- 
pressed, this book is for all general purposes an ade- 
quate history of this interesting but now submerged 
nation, from its beginnings in the mists of tradition to 
its absorption by its powerful neighbor. There is also 
a brief sketch of later events. The book is evidently 
the result of careful and conscientious effort, and sets 
forth clearly the character of the people, and the work- 
ing of the forces of race and religion and nationality in 
their history. 

" Hunting " and " Angling " are the titles of two invit- 
ing volumes in Scribner's " Out of Door Library." Each 
book contains seven papers by as many competent 
hands, and is embellished with the original drawings 
which accompanied the text on its appearance serially 
in " Scribner's Magazine." The sketches are, with two 
exceptions, descriptive of sport on this continent as ex- 
perienced by the several writers the exceptions being 
an account of a kangaroo hunt in Australia, and a good 
paper on Izaak Walton by Mr. Alexander Cargill. 

In bringing together the chronicle plays of Shake- 
speare and his contemporary dramatists, Mr. Thomas 
Donavan has had an excellent idea, but has spoiled it 
by seeking to rearrange the plays " for acting, as well 
as for reading." No stage is likely to produce Peele's 
"Edward I." or Heywood's "Edward IV.," and the 
reader does not want his Elizabethan drama rearranged. 
Mr. Donavan's work is in two volumes, is called " En- 
glish Historical Plays," and includes the two above 
named, the ten of Shakespeare, Marlowe's "Edward 
II.," and Ford's " Perkin Warbeck." 

A volume containing the " Sonnets," with a reproduc- 
tion of Mr. G. F. Watts's glorious " Love Triumphant " 
for a frontispiece, brings to completion the " Temple " 
Shakespeare. The entire set may now be had boxed, in 
two styles, at twenty and thirty dollars, respectively. 
This edition, which so happily meets the wants of both 
student and reader, should find its way into many libra- 
ries, not so much to replace as to supplement the more 
portly and dignified tomes with which we are wont to 



associate the name of our greatest poet. The Macmillan 
Co. publish the edition in this country. 

" The Poetry of Sport " is an anthology edited by 
Mr. Hedley Peek for the " Badminton Library " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). In an introductory essay Mr. Peek 
discusses the question, " Is sport a fitting subject for 
the poet? " and seeks to show that it is. But his best 
argument is to be found in the four hundred pages of 
selections that follow, and that draw upon the works of 
nearly all the greater English poets, besides making us 
acquainted with many names of lesser note. The poems 
are classified under such heads as "Hunting," "Fish- 
ing," and " Shooting." 

After ten years of delay, Professor W. J. Beal has 
completed his important work on the " Grasses of North 
America " (Holt), and prepared the second volume for 
publication. This volume is in a way complete in itself, 
as it contains the entire descriptive section of the work. 
The author has described all the United States species 
that he has been able to obtain, as well as the Mexican 
Gramineos collected by Messrs. Pringle and Palmer. 
Illustrations are sparingly introduced, and represent 
characteristic parts rather than entire plants. The work 
is one of enormous industry, and is highly creditable to 
American botanical scholarship. 

The abridged edition of Professor Bryce's "American 
Commonwealth " (Macmillan) gives us, in a single vol- 
ume of over five hundred pages, those portions of the 
original work which are particularly fitted for use in 
high schools and colleges. While the work was not 
prepared as a text-book, it is in its present form prob- 
ably the best book in existence for educational purposes, 
and the right sort of teacher could do wonders with its 
aid. The wrong sort of teacher, on the other hand, 
would be quite likely to make a mess of it. 

" Parakites by Gilbert Totten Woglom." This is not 
a quotation from" Alice in Wonderland," but the name 
of a real book by a real man. Parakites seem to be 
glorified kites, without tails, that will outsoar the wildest 
dreams of youth. Mr. Woglom's book, which is pub- 
lished by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, tells how to 
make these wonderful devices, and records a great 
variety of interesting experiments with them. The value 
of the invention for photographical and meteorological 
purposes is obvious, and parakite flying may be made to 
combine amusement with serious pursuits in a quite 
delightful fashion. 

Since its first appearance fifteen years ago, Professor 
H. N. Martin's treatise on " The Human Body," pub- 
lished in the " advance course " of the " American Sci- 
ence " series (Holt), has been almost everywhere in this 
country accepted as the standard college text-book in 
human anatomy and physiology. It is a work of which 
American scholarship has reason to be proud, and de- 
Berves the numerous editions through which it has passed. 
The edition now issued is the seventh, and presents a 
thorough revision of the earlier ones, together with much 
new matter. 

The first part of the "List of Private Libraries," 
compiled by Mr. G. Hedeler, of Leipzig, is nearly ready 
For publication. It will include more than five hundred 
private collections owned in the United States and Can- 
ada, the indications having been furnished, for the most 
part, by the owners. The second part will deal simi- 
larly with the private libraries of Great Britain. Pos- 
sessors of libraries with whom Mr. Hedeler has failed

Dr. P. M. Wise is the author of " A Text-Book for 
Training Schools for Nurses " (Putnam), a useful work 
in two volumes. The book is thoroughly practical in 
method, and is to be used for the preparation of recita- 
tions of the regular school sort, providing the material 
for a two years' course of study. The book may also 
be recommended as a manual for household use. It 
tells what to do in a great many emergencies, and is 
well supplied with practical advice for the treatment of 
the sick. 



IjITERARY NOTES. 

A seventh edition of Mr. William L. Jordan's work 
on " The Standard of Value " has just been published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" Jane Eyre," with illustrations by Mr. F. H. Town- 
send, is the latest addition to Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons' handsome and serviceable " Illustrated English 
Library." 

The total sale in this country of Mr. Marion Craw- 
ford's novels has been over half a million copies. " Sara- 
cinesca " leads, with over a hundred and ten thousand to 
its credit. 

Mr. James MacAlister, President of the Drexel Insti- 
tute, is to give a course of six lectures in Philadelphia 
next March upon the general subject of " The History 
of Books and Libraries." 

*' The Outlook " now comes to us in standard maga- 
zine form, and we think the change will be very gen- 
erally appreciated. The first issue of each month will 
be a " magazine number," with illustrations and special 
articles. 

" Sartor Resartus " ushers in the new " Centenary " 
edition of Carlyle, to be completed in thirty volumes. 
This edition, which is an attractive and substantial one 
for library purposes, is imported by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. are the publishers of 
" A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar," the work 
of two English scholars, Messrs. W. W. How and 
H. D. Leigh. The volume extends to nearly six hundred 
pages, is closely but handsomely printed, and judiciously 
illustrated. 

" The Chap-Book " for January 15, although midway 
in a volume, comes to us with the enlarged page that 
has for some time past been announced. The contents 
are about what they have been before, although some- 
what more space is given than formerly to reviews of 
new publications. The department of " Notes " is par- 
ticularly readable. 

The Oxford University Press now has a journal of its 
own, a modest little sheet called " The Periodical," to 
be issued "from time to time as occasion demands." 
The initial number contains notes upon the various pub- 
lications of the Press, and an account of the famous 
Oxford India paper. 

The danger of attributing poems to the wrong au- 
thors, which besets the makers of poetic anthologies, 
has not been escaped by Miss Jennie Thornley Clarke, 
who in a lately published collection of " Songs of the 
South " attributes the familiar " Isle of Long Ago " to 
Philo Henderson, a North Carolina poet who died in 



1852. It is of course pretty generally known that this 
poem was written by the late Benjamin F. Taylor; and 
it appears in the standard editions of his works pub- 
lished by Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co., Chicago. 

The attractive and popular " Warne's Library of 
Natural History," that has been coming to us in sections 
for the past year or two, is now completed by the pub- 
lication of Parts 35 and 36. The work may now be had 
in bound volumes six or twelve as the purchaser may 
choose. It is an admirable work for home reading and 
purposes of general reference. 

" Posters in Miniature " (R. H. Russell & Son) is the 
title of an interesting collection of small black-and- 
white reproductions of many of the best-known exam- 
ples of American and foreign poster-art, with portraits 
of some of the most successful designers. A brief Intro- 
duction by Mr. Edward Penfield and a still briefer 
" Foreword " by Mr. Percival Pollard comprise the only 
text contained in the volume. 

An announcement of interest to all lovers of rural 
life is that of an " Encyclopaedia of American Horticul- 
ture," consisting of signed articles by specialists, cover- 
ing every branch of the subject in its widest sense 
pomology, floriculture, vegetable gardening, greenhouse 
matters, ornamental gardening, the botany of cultivated 
plants, and the like. The work will be under the edi- 
torial charge of Professor L. H. Bailey of Cornell Uni- 
versity; it will be issued in three large volumes, pro- 
fusely illustrated, and will not be completed before 1900. 

At the Winter Convocation of the University of Chi- 
cago, President Harper announced that negotiations 
were pending for a transfer of the School of Applied 
Ethics, which has hitherto held its sessions at Plymouth, 
to Chicago. It is hoped that the School may become an 
organic part of the summer work at the University. In 
this connection we may say a word in praise of the 
unusually interesting January number of the " Interna- 
tional Journal of Ethics." It contains three particularly 
valuable contributions: "The Ethics of Religious Con- 
formity," by the Rev. Hastings Rashdall; " The Ethical 
and Political Problems of New Japan," by Mr. Tokiwo 
Yokoi; and "The Responsibilities of the Lawyer," by 
Mr. Joseph B. Warner. 

We learn from the London "Athenaeum " that the dis- 
covery of another lost classic is announced. A papyrus 
manuscript has recently been acquired by the British 
Museum, the contents of which have been found from 
internal evidence to be the poems of Bacchylides, the 
contemporary and rival of Pindar, which have hitherto 
been known only in fragments. The new manuscript 
is not complete and is grievously mutilated in places; 
but several odes are preserved intact, and others may, 
perhaps, become so when all the fragments have been 
investigated and arranged. In any case, enough is pre- 
served to enable readers to form an estimate of the style 
and genius of a poet whom the ancient world ranked 
near, if not on a level with, Pindar. The poems, like 
all the extant compositions of Pindar, are epiuikian odes, 
and victories in all the principal games Olympian, 
Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean are commemorated 
in them. Upwards of thirty columns are contained in 
the MS., which is well written on good papyrus, and 
appears to be of the first century B. c. The text will

The death of General Francis A. Walker, on the fifth of 
this month, deprives economic science of its most brilliant 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



and forceful American representative. General Walker's 
economic attitude was in most matters thoroughly sane, 
and in accordance with the best conservative tradition, 
a fact which brought into undue prominence the diverg- 
ence of his views upon two or three controverted sub- 
jects from those of the majority of his fellow-economists. 
In spite of what many writers would call its heresies in 
the treatment of the wage-fund, bimetallism, and the 
problem of distribution, General Walker's " Political 
Economy " is the best treatise that we have for advanced 
students of the subject, and fully deserves its great pop- 
ularity. In its two abridgments, also, the work sup- 
plies better than any other in the field the needs of 
American students who are beginners. Among the au- 
thor's other books, the little volume called " Land and 
Its Rent " deserves particular mention for its merciless 
analysis of the theories of Mr. Henry George and the 
unexampled lucidity of its exposition and defence of the 
Rieardian principle. General Walker was born in 1840, 
was graduated from Amherst in 1860, went into the 
army when the war broke out, was wounded at Chan- 
cellorsville, and was confined in Libby Prison. After 
the war was over, and he had restored his shattered 
health, he at first taught, and then occupied several gov- 
ernment posts, becoming successively a chief of bureau 
in the Treasury, Superintendent of the ninth census, and 
Commissioner of Indian affairs. In 1873, he accepted 
a chair at Yale, in 1880 he presided over the tenth 
census, and in 1881 became President of the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology. He was a man who made 
his influence felt in whatever field he might be working, 
a man of strong and engaging personality, and a brilliant 
example of the American scholar and gentleman. His 
death is a severe blow to economic science and to tech- 
nical education alike.

A NEW WORK BY ANDREW LANG. 

PICKLE THE SPY; 

Or, The Incognito of Prince Charles. 

By ANDREW LANG. With Portraits and Illustrations. 8vo, 

342 pages, $5.00. 

** This book is not a novel, though it contains the materials of ro- 
mance. The subject is the mysterious disappearance of Prince Charles. 
The Ambassadors and Courts of Europe, and the spies of England, were 
helpless, till in 1750 a Highland chief of the highest rank sold himself 
to the English Government. The book contains his unpublished letters. 
These, combined with the Stuart papers, the Letters from English Am- 
bassadors in the State papers, the Political Correspondence of Frederick 
the Great, the French archives, illuminate a chapter in secret history. 
The whole exhibits the last romance of the Stuarts, and the extremes 
of loyalty and treason.

IMPORTANT BOOKS 

To be Published in February. 



THE CAMBRIDGE LOWELL. 

Complete Poetical Works of James Russell Lowell. 
Cambridge Edition. From new plates, large type, on 
opaque paper, and attractively bound. With a por- 
trait and engraved title-page, with a vignette of 
Lowell's home, Elmwood. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $2.00; 
half calf, gilt top, $3.50; tree calf or full levant, 
$5.50. 

For the first time Lowell's Complete Poetical Works will 
now appear in a single volume. This is uniform with the Cam- 
bridge Edition of the poetical works of Longfellow, Whittier, 
and Holmes, which are accepted as ideal books for including 
a large amount of matter in convenient form and attractive 
typography. The editorial treatment is the same as that of 
the other Cambridge editions. The text is preceded by a bio- 
graphical sketch, and the book is equipped with short notes 
and an index of first lines. 

THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 

By Dr. CHRESTOS TSOUNTAS, Ephor of Antiquities and 
Director of Excavations at Mycenae, and J. IRVING

FELD. With a map, plans, tables, and over 150 illus- 
trations, including many- full-page plates. 1 vol., 
large 8vo, $6.00. 

This important book, based on " The Mycenae " of Dr. 
Tsountas, published in 1893, offers a reasonably complete sur- 
vey of Mycenaean culture, and registers the most significant 
results of Mycenaean research down to the present time. Its 
illustrations offer the reader and student just the apparatus 
needed to vivify their appreciation of primitive Greek life and 
art. An Introduction by Dr. Dorpfeld, the eminent discov- 
erer of Mycenaean Troy, adds to the value of the work. 

THE SPOILS OF POYNTON. 

A Novel. By HENRY JAMES, author of The Portrait 

of a Lady," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

This is a novel of English characters and scenes, told with 
the high perfection of manner and the fascination of style 
whieh mark the best work of Mr. James. It is one of the 
most interesting of that series of novels with which he has 
charmed all appreciative readers and enriched English litera- 
ture. 

THE LIQUOR PROBLEM

investigations made by Dr. FREDERIC W. WINES and

" It is certainly a remarkable book. The native intrigues are brilliantly handled." 
A. T. QuiLLBR-CoucH, in The Speaker. 

" A really able and brilliant Romance. Beyond question by far the greatest 
romance of the Indian Mutiny, if not also our best history of it. The Scotsman. 



This Romance of the Great Mutiny is the most widely read novel published for a long time. In England three editions 
were exhausted, within the first month of its appearance. In this country, two editions of the book were ordered before its 
day of publication. It is a marvellously vivid book. 



Dedicated to the Sailors who have made the American flag known and 
respected in every harbor of the world. 

The book is written with all a sailor's intense vitality, his strength of imag- 
ination, and the dramatic skill of a born story teller. It is the record of a 
phase of life utterly vanished, but once familiar to many an old family of 
New Bedford, Salem, or Gloucester, and in many a town which, like Salem, 
has still its Museum of East Indian curiosities, brought home by captains 
in the merchantman trade with the far East.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



MEMOIRS OF MARSHAL OUDINOT, 

Due de Eeggio. Compiled from the hitherto unpublished 
souvenirs of the Duchess de Reggio by GASTON STIEGLER, 
and now first translated into English by ALEXANDER TEIX- 
KIKA DE MATTOS. With 2 Portraits in Heliogravure. 12mo, 
cloth. 

The marshal's wife was much with her husband in the field, 
accompanying him, for instance, during the retreat from Mos- 
cow. Of that she gives a very graphic description; and, 
indeed, she draws vivid pictures of all that stirring epoch. 
The book takes in the Revolution, the Directory, Napoleon's 
ascendency, the Restoration, and comes up to about 1830. It 
has photographs of the marshal and his wife, who in the end, 
of course, threw in their lot with the Bourbons. 

THE TRUE LIFE OF 
CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD F. BURTON. 

Written by his niece, GEORGIANA M. STISTED, with the au- 
thority and approval of the Burton family. 12mo, cloth, 
with portrait, $2.00. 

Few men have had careers so full of romantic interest, 
change, and adventure. as that of Sir Richard Burton. The 
object of the author of this memoir has been " first to tell the 
truth, secondly to supply a want often complained of the 
story of the great traveller's life in a popular form." The re- 
sult is a notable and welcome addition to biographical litera- 
ture. As an English critic has remarked, " there have been 
few better romances ever written." 

THE EARLY CORRESPONDENCE OF 

HANS VON BULOW. 

Edited by his Widow. Selected and translated by CONSTANCE 
BACHB. With Portraits. 8vo, cloth, $4.50. 
These letters contain graphic descriptions of the trials of a 
young musician, and much interesting gossip about Liszt and 
Wagner, to whose encouragement Von Billow owed so much in 
his youth and early manhood. There are many revelations of 
precocious talents in other directions than music, and the bio- 
graphical details illustrate a portion of the artist's life of which 
little has been known. 

OUR JUVENILE OFFENDERS. 

By W. DOUGLAS MORRISON, author of "Jews Under the 
Romans," etc. A new volume in the Criminology Series. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In this volume Mr. Morrison deals with the extent and char- 
acter of juvenile crime. He shows the effect of sex and age 
on criminal tendencies, and describes the geographical distri- 
bution of the juvenile criminal population. He discusses the 
physical and mental characteristics of the juvenile offender ; 
his parental condition, his social condition, his economic con- 
dition. Finally he deals with the institutions at present in 
existence for reclaiming the young criminal, and the methods 
which are the most likely to be successful in attaining this 
result. Mr. Morrison has a vast amount of personal experi- 
ence behind him, and his work derives additional interest from 
the fact that he is dealing with a subject which he knows at 
first hand. 

THE STORY OF EXTINCT CIVILIZATIONS 
OF THE EAST. 

By ROBERT ANDERSON, M.A., F.A.S., author of " Early En- 
gland," "The Stuart Period," etc. A new volume in the 
Library of Useful Stories. 16mo, cloth, 40 cents. 
One of the most suggestive and interesting subjects treated 
in this series is the theme afforded by the magnificent bygone 
empires of the East, which are described by Mr. Anderson 
with a succinctness and a grasp of essential points due to a 
thorough mastery of the subject. 



Second Edition. 

THE BEGINNERS OF A NATION. 

A History of the Source and Rise of the Earliest English Set- 
tlements in America, with Special Reference to the Life and 
Character of the People. The first volume in A History 
of Life in the United States. By EDWARD EGGLESTON. 
Small 8vo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Written with firm grasp of the theme, inspired by ample knowl- 
edge, and made attractive by a vigorous and resonant style, the book 
will receive much attention. It is a great theme the author has taken 
up, and he grasps it with the confidence of a master." N. Y. Times. 

Third Edition. 

THE SEVEN SEAS. 

A new volume of poems by RUDYARD KIPLING, author of 
" Many Inventions," "Barrack-Room Ballads," etc. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50; half-calf, $3.00; morocco, $5.00. 
" The spirit and method of Kipling's fresh and virile song have taken 
the English reading world. . . . When we turn to the larger portion of 
' The Seven Seas,' how imaginative it is, how impassioned, how su- 
perbly rhythmic and sonorous ! . . . The ring and diction of this verse 
add new elements to our song. The true laureate of Greater Britain." 
E. C. STEDMAN, in The Book Buyer. 

THE STORY OF ARCHITECTURE. 

An Outline of the Styles in all Countries. By CHARLES 
THOMPSON MATHEWS, M.A., Fellow of the American 
Institute of Architects, author of "The Renaissance under 
the Valois," etc. Illustrated. Uniform with "Schools and 
Masters of Painting," and " Schools and Masters of Sculp- 
ture." 12mo, cloth, $3.00. 

This compact yet comprehensive history of architecture 
offers a study of the effects of civilization upon architecture 
as a necessity and an art. Almost all the architectural mon- 
uments specially referred to are described from personal 
knowledge . American architecture receives careful attention, 
and Asiatic and Oriental architecture, usually neglected in 
such books, is discussed with an exceptional fulness of infor- 
mation.

THE CAREER OF CANDIDA. 
By GEORGE PASTON, author of "A Study of Prejudices, n 

etc. No. 208, Town and Country Library. 

"A really interesting book." London Daily Chronicle. 

"One of the most robust and refreshing stories of the year. It 
tackles more than one thorny social problem with admirable courage, 
and challenges Mrs. Grundy to mortal encounter, but there is not the 
least verbal offence in it, not even to the most priggish and prudish of 
novel readers." London Daily Telegraph. 

McLEOD OF THE CAMERONS. 

By M. HAMILTON, author of "A Self- Denying Ordinance.'* 

No. 207, Town and Country Library. 

The promise shown by this author in her former book is 
more than sustained in her new story. She describes vividly T 
and in an extremely interesting way, the different phases of 
military and social life in the isle of Malta and in England. 
Her characters are firmly impressed in the mind of the reader, 
the situations are carefully worked out, and the book is cer- 
tain to add to her reputation and increase her popularity.

SCIENCE AND THE NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT. 

There is something quite anomalous in the 
fact that the capital of the United States is a 
comparatively unimportant city, with hardly 
any pretensions to leadership in the intellectual 
concerns of the nation. When we think how 
much London or Paris means for English or 
French art, science, and literature, and how 
little Washington means for anything but 
American politics, we touch upon one of the 
most distinctive characteristics of our New 
World civilization. Historically, of course, this 
peculiarity is easily accounted for. The na- 
tional capital was created by law under circum- 
stances almost as unfavorable as those attend- 
ing the efforts of Peter the Great to provide a 
new capital for the Russian Empire. The ob- 
jects were different in the two cases, but there 
was a considerable similarity in the conditions. 
Both Petersburg and Washington came into 
existence as " fiat " capitals, were not very fav- 
orably situated for rapid development, and had 
to contend with the rivalries of old and jealous 
centres of civic and intellectual life. Again, 
our national capital is the seat of a federal gov- 
ernment, and the federal principle is necessarily 
antagonistic to the concentration of national 
energy at any single focus. But it may well 
be questioned whether the centralizing tend- 
encies everywhere so strongly influencing our 
national life will not eventually have their way 
in the affairs of the higher culture, and make 
of Washington, in the course of time, our cap- 
ital in the true comprehensive sense. As the 
foresight of the great Tsar has been justified 
by the development of St. Petersburg, and as 
the capital of the federal empire of Germany 
is slowly but surely overshadowing the older 
German capitals, so it is not unreasonable to 
think that the " manifest destiny " of which we 
hear so much is at work shaping the capital of 
this Republic into a home for the humanities. 
The time may quite possibly arrive when the 
vanishing ascendancy of Boston, and the accom- 
plished ascendancy of New York, and the hoped- 
for ascendancy of struggling Chicago, in the 
world of American letters and learning, shall 
come to be viewed in the larger perspective as

[Feb. 1, 



but temporary phases of the historical develop- 
ment that will have transformed our nominal 
capital into the one real centre of our intellec- 
tual activities. 

While such a consummation as this, however 
devoutly to be wished, can only be a matter of 
the far distant future, it may at least be said 
that events are slowly shaping themselves to 
bring it about. Washington is becoming more 
and more the centre of an intelligent and cul- 
tivated society, more and more a city to which 
men of wealth and leisure are drawn by the 
various advantages which it has to offer. The 
forces of official and diplomatic life add to its 
society a color that cannot, in the nature of 
things, be found elsewhere, and that seems to 
be one of the necessary elements of the society 
of a capital in the European sense. The com- 
pletion of the new home provided for the Con- 
gressional Library is an incident that helps to 
accentuate the growing importance of Wash- 
ington in our intellectual life. What will prob- 
ably in time become at once the largest and the 
most useful of our public libraries can hardly 
fail to act as a magnet in attracting to Wash- 
ington people of the sort most to be desired 
in any great city. The project of a National 
University, to be supported at the public charge, 
has long been "in the air," and, notwithstand- 
ing the grave objections that may be urged, 
finds much to be said in its favor, as the elo- 
quent plea recently made in its behalf by Pres- 
ident Jordan sufficiently attests. Meanwhile, 
the educational institutions already established, 
or to be established, in Washington under re- 
ligious auspices tend, and will continually tend, 
to further the evolution of the capital in the 
suggested direction. 

It is not our present purpose, however, to 
discuss this subject in its broader aspect, but 
rather to call attention to a single phase of the 
subject, brought into prominence just now by 
the leading article in a recent number of " Sci- 
ence." Under the caption, u A National De- 
partment of Science," Mr. Charles W. Dabney, 
Jr., makes a strong plea for the systematization 
and unification of the scientific work done by 
the several Departments of the Government, 
and incidentally gives his readers a luminous 
conspectus of the field of that work. A few 
sentences from Mr. Dabney's article may be 
given in illustration of its purport : " The 
United States Government is doing more to 
discover the resources of its territory and to 
teach its people to develope them than any other 
government in the world. . . . The scientific 



work of the Government is carried on by many 
agencies scattered through the various Depart- 
ments. . . . Some of them are not connected 
with any department. . . . The majority of 
these bureaus have no logical connection with 
the Departments to which they belong. . . . 
The time has arrived when the successful pros- 
ecution of the scientific work of the Govern- 
ment requires that these various bureaus should 
be organized in accordance with a logical plan. 
. . . The United States Government now em- 
ploys 5225 persons in this scientific and eco- 
nomic work, not including the census, and ex- 
pends for it annually nearly eight million dol- 
lars." Many others similar in character might 
be made. 

The objections to the present system are more 
than merely formal, although the illogicality 
which gives the Treasury Department control 
of the Life Saving Service, and which tosses 
the Weather Bureau about from the Depart- 
ment of War to that of Agriculture, should 
alone be enough to condemn it. The great 
practical objection to the system is the dupli- 
cation of work which it entails, and the conse- 
quent confusion, to say nothing of the waste, 
that results. Mr. Dabney gives many instances 
of this duplication and confusion, a few of 
which may be quoted. " The Government has 
three separate and distinct agencies for meas- 
uring the land of the country." " There are 
four hydrographic offices in as many depart- 
ments." " The Government has at least five 
separate and distinct chemical laboratories in 
the city of Washington alone." Perhaps the 
most striking example of this scientific chaos 
is afforded by the subject of irrigation. " The 
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
Agriculture some time ago appointed a board 
to compile the laws on irrigation, and find out 
what each bureau of each department should 
do. It took this board a year to inform these 
two Secretaries what the law required of each 
of them. Its report shows that eight bureaus 
in the two departments must cooperate in order 
to accomplish any thorough work on the great 
problems of irrigation. . . . It is needless to say 
that, with so many agencies to promote irriga- 
tion, very little has been done by any of them." 
These examples tell their own tale, and it only 
remains to add that upon top of all this con- 
fusion comes the work of the Census Bureau, 
which, ignoring the statistical work of the sev- 
eral Departments, proceeds every ten years to 
collect its own statistics in its own way, and 
sometimes, at least, does the work so badly that 



1897. J

the result commands but the qualified confi- 
dence of the scientific world. 

The state of things thus described cer- 
tainly calls for a remedy ; although opinions 
may differ as to just what the remedy should 
be. What Mr. Dajbney proposes is the sepa- 
ration of the bureaus now engaged in scientific 
work from the Departments to which they are 
attached, and the creation and organization, 
under expert advice, of a new Department of 
Science. The plan is deserving of considera- 
tion, and the bringing of the employees of the 
several scientific bureaus under the rules of the 
classified service, recently accomplished, has at 
least smoothed the way for some such change. 
Four of the Departments now existing would 
find their responsibilities greatly lightened by 
this reorganization, but it is probable that the 
inertia of officialism will prove a serious obsta- 
cle to the reform, for cabinet officers, like other 
mortals, are jealous of their prestige and their 
prerogatives. Still, the necessity for some co- 
ordination of endeavor is so obvious that a de- 
termined effort to bring it about is worth mak- 
ing, and the suggestion now put forward has 
many arguments in its favor. As Mr. Dabney 
says : " With enormous expenditure of brain 
and money [the Government] has done a vast 
deal for the advancement of science, but it is 
deplorable that so much has been wasted in 
doing this. We garner the golden grain of 
truth, to be sure, but we cut our wheat with the 
old-fashioned sickle, bind it with straw, thresh 
it with the flail, and then wait for a favorable 
wind to blow away the chaff. Harvested by 
these antiquated methods, our product costs us 
a great deal more than it should, and, what is 
worse, we lose a large part of the grain." With 
the organization of such a Department as Mr. 
Dabney urges, Washington would become, even 
more emphatically than it is at present, the 
most important centre of scientific investigation 
in the United States, and, to recur to the more 
general thesis of our opening paragraphs, one 
very notable step would have been taken toward 
the realization of the broader ideal of what 
should be, in the best sense of the term, a na- 
tional capital.

THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
IN GERMANY. 

Evidence of an interesting change of attitude re- 
garding the admittance of women to the German 
universities, with all the privileges of full immatric- 
ulation, as well as to the learned professions, may 
be found in the hundred and twenty opinions of 
university professors, journalists, and teachers at 
girls' schools collected by Mr. Arthur Kirchhoff in 
a pamphlet entitled " Die Akademische Frau " which 
has lately appeared. The mere statistical fact that 
almost two-thirds of the replies to the question, 
" Are women entitled to, and qualified for, the 
higher academic study?" are in the affirmative, 
marks a most important advance in the movement. 
Everyone who is familiar with the state of public 
opinion even five years ago will admit that such a 
majority would have been impossible then, and is 
decidedly surprising now. Not that all of these 
opinions are strong pleas in favor of the admission 
of women to the universities ; but they all have this 
in common : that they desire to see the present legal 
obstacles which bar women from the lecture-rooms 
and degrees of the universities removed, in order that 
the question may be settled by free and unham- 
pered competition in which, according to some, the 
other sex will hold its own, while others (and these 
are perhaps still in the majority) expect their defeat. 

As this is obviously a case in which the votes cast 
should not be counted merely, but weighed, the opin- 
ions of those who avowedly base them on actual expe- 
rience at universities admitting women (e. g., those 
of Switzerland) are more valuable than those formed 
on mere b, priori reasoning. It must be encour- 
aging to the advocates of the movement that they 
are almost unanimous in favor of opening the uni- 
versities to women on equal terms with men where- 
ever proof of equal preparatory training is given. 
As far as the often alleged inconvenience of co- 
educational university instruction is concerned, the 
testimony of all those who have had actual experi- 
ence is uniformly negative. As to the relative pro- 
ficiency of female students as compared with their 
male fellow-students, the reports based on actual 
observation vary. Professor Gusserow, of the 
gynaecological clinic of the Berlin Charite", found 
that during the five years of his professorship at 
Zurich the female candidates for the degree of M.D. 
reached only in exceptional cases the male average. 
Prof. F. von Winckel, director of the gynaecological 
clinic at the University of Munich, states as his ex- 
perience, extending over thirty years, that the forty 
female assistants employed by him during that time 
" were at least as proficient " as the male assistants. 

Of the different departments, the mathematicians 
are unanimously and quite strongly in favor of the ad- 
mission of women. Professor Klein of Goettingen has 
found them " in every respect equal to their fellow- 
students," and Professor Meyer of Kiel sends a list 
of twenty-one women who have gained prominence 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



in pure and applied mathematics, from Hypatia to 
Sophie Kovalevsky. The professors of the various 
descriptive natural sciences and those of Political 
Economy are also practically agreed on a favorable 
verdict. Among the professors of philosophy there 
is hut one dissenting voice. In medicine, dentistry 
and the diseases of the eye are especially pointed 
out as suitable specialties for women ; while their 
admission to general practice and surgery is rather 
strongly opposed, mainly on the ground of defi- 
ciency in physical strength. The journalists and the 
teachers in girls' schools are almost unanimously 
strong advocates of the higher education of women. 
It will doubtless occasion some surprise to learn 
that, if the opinions here printed are at all typical, 
both historians and philologists are rather averse to 
any innovation. 

Under these circumstances, it is not difficult to 
predict the probable course of the movement in 
Germany. As the requirements for the admission 
to the university cannot and will not be lowered, the 
establishment of fitting-schools for girls is the first 
and most pressing need. Valuable suggestions as 
to how the curriculum in these schools may best be 
adapted to the peculiar needs of the case are given 
in some of the reports of girls' teachers in the 
pamphlet already referred to. Much is hoped from 
the introduction of the " elective " plan (similar to 
that at our American colleges), which will permit 
some women to pursue a more general course of 
education, while enabling others to fit themselves 
for special work. And it is not without interest to 
find that by the introduction of the elective system 
in the boys' gymnasium it is hoped to relieve to some 
extent that high pressure which has already caused 
considerable concern among physicians, and which 
various remedies have so far failed to alleviate. 
Such introduction would doubtless mean a deviation 
from the time-honored principles of secondary edu- 
cation which knew only required studies, and an 
approach to the methods of the American college.

LITERATURE AND PATRIOTISM IN THE SCHOOLS. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Is it not possible that literary study in the secondary 
schools might be more efficacious than it now is for the 
begetting of a worthy sort of patriotism? 

When a high-school boy goes up to college, he takes 
with him, over and beyond his knowledge of prescribed 
branches, a few very definite notions for which nobody 
in particular is responsible, which cannot be traced to 
any one teacher or course of study, but which are rather 
an unconscious deposit in his system from the public- 
school atmosphere. One of these notions is the young- 
American patriotic sentiment that the United States is 
" a great and glorious country." Of course we all know 
that his meaning is purely a Philistine meaning. Called 
upon to explain how his country was great and glorious, 
your high-school boy would give you statistics; he would 
give you the census, the crop reports, square miles, 
national wealth, national position among the powers, 
in fine, Fourth of July braggadocio. 

Now it is easy enough to say to the boy: Your notions 
of your country are inadequate. Not that you are wrong 
to exult in the size of your America, but your view of 
size is a commercial view. You like the Mississippi 
River, let us say, because it is large. This sentiment 
is noble or unworthy, according to the way in which you 
have come at it. We happen to know that you are 
chiefly attracted by the thought (determined by the 
commercial atmosphere which you breathe) of how great 
a carrying power the river must be, how many steam- 
boats may navigate it, how many saw-mills it may turn, 
how many towns it may give their opportunity for 
increased numbers of furnaces and chimneys and a mul- 
tiplied census. What you ought to mean is that you 
like the idea of a great river; that it appeals to your 
imagination ; that (if you happen to live beside it) you 
find it good to look upon as you come and go, to con- 
template in quiet hours. Such a river should be a 
source of inspiration to you, so that you should live by 
it not only in the sense of having your dwelling upon 
its bluffs, making it sustain you from thirst at the north 
and receive your drainage at the south, but that in a 
higher way your life should be influenced by it, should 
tend more and more to measure itself by the river, and 
to absorb from it, as the years go by, beyond a mere 
physical health, a fine, an increasingly fine, spiritual 
well-being. And so your boast about America should 
come down to such a basis as this: The largeness and 
expanse of America are more admirable than the 
crowded limits of most European countries, for the 
same reason that the sea is more admirable than the 
frog-pond, or the giant redwood tree than the stunted 
pine. Your phrase " our glorious country " should refer 
to the magnificent expanse of virgin soil in America, 
and all that it promises to the future of the race, its 
liberty, its independence, its health, its social salvation. 
These are some of the thoughts that the high-school boy 
should have to back up his notion of this " great and 
glorious country " ; and he can gain them by means of 
the culture that comes through books. 

If one aim of literary study in the schools could be 
the cultivation of a finer sentiment of patriotism, some 
books must be more potent than others to achieve this 
aim. For illustration of the sort of American literature 
which seems to me best fitted to impart a new and deeper

meaning to the patriotic sentiment, I have in mind the 
works of Walt Whitman. One of the strongest sides 
of this poet is, of course, his ultra-Americanism. He 
sings a pride in his land intenser than was ever sung 
before. A poet, he outdoes even professional patriots 
on their own ground. It was complained of Thoreau 
that he was rather too proud of his native Concord. 
" He talked about Nature as if she had been born and 
brought up in Concord." Of Whitman, in the same 
spirit, one might say that he often talked about America 
as if not only Nature but the best of human nature and 
human institutions and all free government and patriotic 
loyalty had been born and brought up here. But how- 
ever rampant his enthusiasm in this strain may some- 
times seem, I think it will be found always sound at the 
core. Material things American he does celebrate, but 
he illumines them ever with the pure light of the spirit. 
His is a patriotism always informed of the highest ideals : 
it is never mere Chauvinism. To his view, America is the 
chosen of all lands, reserved to the last to be the stage 
for the final scenes of the drama of social and individual 
evolution. Always for him America had reference to 
the soul and to the human race. His intense patriotism 
was bound up with his intense religiousness. Always his 
pride was in the becoming of America; it did not stop 
at the " has become." 

Whitman's books, of course, are too large to be intro- 
duced entire into school work, even if there were no 
objection to certain portions of them on the score of 
unwholesomeness. Of the existing volumes of selections 
from both his prose and poetry, I am not sure that any 
consists of the passages best calculated to exert an en- 
nobling influence on the patriotic sentiment. I believe 
other selections are contemplated. One thing seems 
inevitable : that a part at least of the immense spiritual 
power of Whitman must soon be laid hold upon by edu- 
cators. That he has been neglected so long, is perhaps 
nobody's fault so.much as that of his own genius. It 
would be idle to attempt to explain away our objec- 
tions to some of his work. But whatever is false or 
mistaken or unideal in literature will, for all but the 
false and the mistaken and the unideal in spirit, die 
of its own ill-nature. The point to dwell upon with 
satisfaction is that whatever is true, high-minded, aspir- 
ing, no amount of what is wrong-headed can suppress 
for long. 

One poem in particular that I should like to see read 
and studied in every high school in the land is the " Song 
of the Universal." Never was national destiny so greatly 
conceived ; and never the conception sung with such 
unerring charm. The good alone is universal (so runs 
the theme) ; all history makes for the perfection of the 
soul: 

" And thou America, 

For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality, 
For these (not for thyself) thon hast arrived." 

So admirable a type is this Whitman song of the variety 
of literature I have in mind, that would space permit I 
should like to quote it entire. Enough has been said, 
however, to recall its clear spiritual ring, its glowing 
devotion to high national ideals. Surely such an exalted 
view of America and its mission were well worth trying 
for. It is a sort of culture that can come through books. 
It has not come from the books the secondary schools 
have been using. Why not try such books as this ?

"THE PRIMARY CONDITION OF UNDERSTANDING 
WHITMAN," AND THE SECONDARY CONDI- 
TION OF UNDERSTANDING ANYBODY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

To see a friend's faults, to see that he is weak where 
another is strong, unsentimentally to understand his 
nature, and yet to care a good deal for him, requires a 
cool head and a warm heart. So it is with our friends, 
the books. I must say the extreme Whitmanites, of 
whom Professor Triggs is one, seem to me to get a little 
warm-headed in their "boundless enthusiasm." To 
feel and to know a poet, or anyone else, we must do two 
things: give ourselves up to him as Mr. Burroughs and 
Professor Triggs give themselves up to Whitman, and 
then reflect, compare, define. " Boundless enthusiasm " 
does not help true definition; comparison is not reliable 
when you glance at one thing and scrutinize another. 
As I said in my review, Mr. Burronghs's telescopic 
scrutiny of Whitman helps us. I protest, not against 
his enthusiasm for Whitman, but against his " negative 
criticism " of almost everybody not Whitman, against 
his total failure to make allowance for the fact that a 
man a mile off looks smaller than a man a yard from 
you. Mr. Donaldson keeps his head cool, and though 
he does n't say much about his emotions, they seem to 
work pretty well, albeit quietly. His contribution is to 
the biography of the man, not to the appreciation of 
the poet. When Professor Triggs calls Mr. Donaldson's 
book " wholly inadequate," he condemns it for not being 
what Mr. Donaldson did n't pretend it was and did n't 
want it to be. 

I despair of convincing Professor Triggs of the fact 
that I too have felt the irresistible grace of Whitman's 
strength, that I have sat with a friend, half reading, 
half chanting the lilac-perfumed pages of the hymn to 
" delicate death," that I have " personally absorbed " 
the subtle quality of that large gray soul into which all 
out-of-doors has entered. " Nay, and thou 'It month! " 
But after the thrill of the reading is over, " the hesitat- 
ing, niggardly spirit of criticism " reminds me that this 
is one of many gifted men who moved me in something 
the same way; and the enhancement of soul given me by 
one poet does not in the least incline me to think of the 
others as dogs and weaklings. 

The truth is that these enthusiasts adopt Whitman's 
attitude toward Whitman. As a creative, stimulating 
attitude, this is a huge success; but as a receptive atti- 
tude it is not. Whitman recognized that his own self 
was, willy-nilly, the most important fact in his life. It 
is not quite so true when somebody else " absorbs " 
Whitman and says Whitman's self is the most important 
thing in the life of the world. 

Professor Triggs harps on " the feeling of love and 
the desire of comradeship." Perhaps we who try to keep 
our heads cool and see two sides of a thing, had to some 
slight extent that feeling and that desire before ever we 
found them in the democratic chants. He says that we 
fail in interpretation by so much as we are " cold, crit- 
ical, disinterested." Now disinteresting may possibly 
mean uninteresting; but disinterested, to anyone who 
knows English, means without bias, prejudice, or selfish 
interest. Professor Triggs is thus the creator of a deli- 
cious absurdity, sufficiently in keeping with his theory 
of "absorbing" things, sponge- fashion, without criti- 
cism or discrimination. 

Before this tiny critical tilt, I should have said that 
Whitman was second only to Emerson as a prime force

in American literature. If anyone can convince me to 
the contrary, it is a not disinterested admirer like Pro- 
fessor Triggs. Better trust Arnold, after all, and beware 
of " the personal estimate." After " personal absorp- 
tion " we must have impersonal judgment in a worthy 
criticism. GEORGE C. COOK. 

University of Iowa, Jan. 19, 1897. 



WHITMAN CANT VS. CRITICISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the last number of THE DIAL, Mr. O. L. Triggs, 
in speaking of Walt Whitman, says: " By so much as a 
reader remains cold, critical, disinterested, before an 
object requiring the feeling of identity and the desire 
of comradeship as the condition of understanding, to that 
extent does he fail in his interpretation." 

Does this mean that before we can truly enjoy Whit- 
man we must be in some sort hypnotized ? Why shall 
we not remain cold if the work does not naturally warm 
us up ? Why shall we not remain critical when we 
read the " Leaves of Grass " as much as when we read 
" Paradise Lost " ? Is there any more reason why we 
should not be disinterested in reading Whitman than 
when we are reading Shelley ? Who made Mr. F. W. 
Rolleston an arbiter in literature ? And if he chooses 
to be fervent when other readers are cold, and uncritical 
and interested when they are critical and disinterested, 
is this an infallible test of his good judgment? In 
short, is not this the mere cant of a coterie ? 

For myself, I must say that if I must muddle my 
brains by dismissing what critical faculty I possess, and 
by giving up that disinterestedness which is commend- 
able in all the affairs of life, before I can be competent 
to enjoy any author, I shall be content to diminish the 
possible circle of pleasures. The argument presented 
by your correspondent seems to me to be the same pre- 
sented by quacks and charlatans in all ages that in 
order to judge properly of their theories and exploits 
the first condition is that you shall silence your judg- 
ment and stifle all the promptings of common-sense, 
after which you shall behold visions not visible to the 
vulgar herd. j. WATSON. 

Little Bock, Ark., Jan. 19, 1897. 



THE HUMAN AND THE SUPERHUMAN VIEW 

OF WHITMAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent, Mr. Oscar Lovell Triggs, in criti- 
cising Donaldson's " Walt Whitman the Man " in your 
last issue, starts in with the sweeping statement that 
" Mr. Donaldson can easily be proved untrustworthy in 
a hundred points," but during his long ramble does not 
once give an instance where Mr. Donaldson is at fault. 
Such admirers as Mr. Triggs appear to resent any hu- 
man account of Whitman's personality, preferring to 
have his smallest actions idealized and surrounded with 
a halo. They prefer to dream of the " good gray poet " 
as always communing with the gods. Such a repre- 
sentation of himself, Whitman would have been the first 
to resent. 

Most readers of Mr. Donaldson's book will readily 
understand that it was never the author's intention to 
present a literary study of Whitman. His object was, 
as stated in his title, to give a view of " Whitman the 
Man," to tell how he lived, what were his habits and 
character, how he composed his poems, etc. That he 
has very generally been adjudged to have succeeded in 



doing what he set out to do is probably sufficient for 
him, even though he may have failed to attain to the 
somewhat superhuman conception of Whitman involved 
in Mr. Triggs's fearful and wonderful theories of literary 
interpretation. FRANCIS P. HARPER.

MISS MOLINEUX'S "BROWNING PHRASE BOOK" 

ONCE MORE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Allow me briefly to explain the plan of the Index in 
this book, which your reviewer seems still to misappre- 
hend. Its purpose is two-fold: first and mainly, to give 
the novelties and eccentricities of Browning's diction 
his many compounds, unusual words, etc., with all 
proper names in the poems except such as furnish titles 
to poems, like Pippa, Colom.be, etc., or otherwise need no 
reference to enable one to find them; second, to obviate 
the necessity of giving the quotations in the body of the 
book under more than one catch-word. 

The Index, for instance, begins with 122 compounds 
in a-, from a-begging and a-bloom to a-writing and a-yelp. 
Of these only twenty occur in passages given in the 
body of the book; like a-blush in " And stand all ready 
for morn's joy a-blush," which is worth quoting aside 
from its containing the compound. Under all- there are 
seventy-six compounds, few of which are in quotable 
passages. 

On the next page are such peculiar compounds as 
altar-scrap-snatcher, altar-orts, alley-phiz, alteration-itch, 
angle-niche, angler-simile, etc. Of these only alteration- 
itch is in the body of the book in " Authorship has the 
alteration-itch! " 

Unusual words, like aboriginary, ampottosity, anticise, 
etc., seldom appear in quotable passages. 

To have given the quotations in the body of the book 
under two or three catch- words would have made it too 
bulky and expensive. To have added the passages con- 
taining mere peculiarities of diction would have increased 
the bulk seven fold. 

In selecting the single catch-word the editor may not 
always have made the best choice. In the passage cited 
by your reviewer, death, pause, or work might have 
been better than lover; but I do not see any other pas- 
sage under love and its derivations to which such objec- 
tion could fairly be made, and on looking through the 
pages I note very few instances in which I should change 
the catch-word. 

Miss Molineux is too modest in referring to the 
" lapses and losses of various kinds which involved a 
change of plan during the process of the book's evolu- 
tion." After all these lapses and losses, and the changes 
which they necessitated, she practically remade the 
entire book. The final result is as complete and sym- 
metrical as if she had been sole editor from the start.

[While we do not see that the above controverts 
the essential criticisms of our reviewer, we are quite 
willing to give the book the benefit of Dr. Rolfe's 
generous expansion of his previous explanation and 
commendation of it. ED. DIAL.]

A BRITISH VETERAN'S TALE OF INDIA.* 

We have read Lord Boberts's narrative of 
his long and honorable career in India as soldier 
and administrator with unusual interest. The 
story is in itself naturally a stirring and diver- 
sified one, covering as it does such striking 
events as the great Mutiny (with its dramatic 
episodes, the siege of Delhi, the relief and the 
siege of Lucknow, the battles of Agra and 
Cawnpore, etc.), the Umbeyla expedition, the 
Abyssinian expedition, and the Afghan war ; 
and it is told with a soldierly brevity and pre- 
cision, and an unaffected modesty as to the 
writer's own exploits and services, that together 
constitute its distinctive literary merit and 
charm. At the close of his preface Lord Roberts 
expresses the wish that his readers " will bear 
in mind that the writer is a soldier, not a man 
of letters, and will therefore forgive all faults 
of style and language." There are few faults of 
this sort to forgive. Lord Roberts shows con- 
clusively that he can wield the pen as well as 
the sword ; and it is not too much to say that 
in point of style his eminently terse, manly, 
and straightforward composition may well be 
taken as a model by those having a similar lit- 
erary undertaking in view. 

Lord Roberts was born at Cawnpore, India, 
and spent his childhood and early youth in 
England. In 1852 he sailed for Calcutta, an 
artillery cadet, and on his arrival was appointed 
to a native field-battery. After four months' 
irksome service in the East he was sent to 
Peshawar, on the Afghan frontier (the real 
field of military activity), where he joined his 
father, General Sir Abraham Roberts, then 
commanding the Lahore division. In 1854 he 
got his troop in the crack Bengal Horse Artil- 
lery ; and two years later received his first staff 
appointment, with the immediate duty of assist- 
ing in the survey of Kashmir. A mission to 
Kandahar (which he was to revisit at the head 
of an army twenty- six years later) followed. 
Up to this date the career of the ambitious 
young soldier had been one of relatively halcyon 
days and plodding advancement ; but stirring 
times, of fast-falling vacancies and swift pro- 
motions, were at hand. The first distinct mut- 
terings of the storm long gathering unheeded

(save by a few wise and watchful spirits, like 
Sir Henry Lawrence)* over the slender British 
contingent in India were heard early in 1857; 
and a few months later it broke. During Feb- 
ruary, March, and April, disquieting rumors 
had reached Peshawar of mystic chupattis (un- 
leavened cakes) sent secretly about the country, 
apprising the natives of some grave impending 
event. Unrest was in the air. Soon came 
reports of overt mutinous acts ; of outbreaks at 
Berhampur and Barrackpore ; of bungalows 
set in flames ; of the Sepoys' objections to the 
cartridges served out with the newly-adopted 
rifles, which had, they asserted, been greased 
with a defiling mixture of cow's fat and lard 
ingredients the one of which is as hateful to 
the Hindu as the other is to the Mussulman. 
Lord Roberts notes the pervading disregard of 
these sinister warnings, and especially the fatal 
confidence in their men of British officers 
attached to Sepoy regiments. Of an officer at 
Nowshera, who had served all his life with 
Hindustanis, he says : 

" In less than two months' time the Hindustanis, of 
whom the Colonel was so proud, had broken into open 
mutiny . . . and the commanding officer, a devoted 
soldier who lived for his regiment, and who implored 
that his men might not have their arms taken away, as 
he had implicit confidence ' in them, and would stake 
his life on their fidelity,' had blown his brains out be- 
cause he found that confidence misplaced." 

Prompt action saved Peshawar from the 
horrors that were enacted at other places. On 
hearing of the mutiny, the authorities promptly 
seized all native correspondence lying at the 
post-office ; and the character of the papers 
found made it clear that every Hindustani regi- 
ment in the garrison was ripe for revolt. Says 
the author : 

" A strong interest attaches to these letters, for they 
brought to light the true feeling of the natives towards 
us at the time, and it was evident from them that the 
Sepoys had really been made to believe that we intended 
to destroy their caste by various unholy devices of which 
the issue of contaminating cartridges was one." 

Prompt disarmament of the native regiments 
at Peshawar followed the seizure of the mails ; 
and the good effect of this measure (which was 
fatuously opposed as " uncalled for " by the 
officers) was at once apparent. Comparative 
quiet reigned at Peshawar ; and its residents 
were spared such scenes of blood and rapine as 
were enacted at Meerut and elsewhere in the 
province. How serious was the plight of the 
English in the Punjab at this juncture, appears 



* Fourteen years before the outbreak, Lawrence predicted 
the mutiny and accurately foretold the course it would take.

[Feb. 1, 



from the fact that the available force of British 
troops there numbered about 15,000, as against 
some 65,000 natives, two-thirds of them Hin- 
dustanis. A strong garrison of trustworthy 
men for each station being thus out of the ques- 
tion, a movable column was organized. Lord 
Roberta's account of his experiences with this 
column, to which he was attached as staff offi- 
cer, are extremely interesting. At Lahore he 
first witnessed one of those terrible scenes 
which the mention of the mutiny recalls to every 
mind familiar with its story. Two mutineers 
had been sentenced to death by court martial, 
and the commanding officer decided that they 
should be blown away from guns, in the pres- 
ence of their comrades. 

" A parade was at once ordered. The troops were 
drawn up so as to form three sides of a square; on the 
fourth side were two guns. As the prisoners were being 
brought to the parade, one of them asked me if they 
were going to be blown from the guns. I said, ' Yes.' 
He made no further remark, and they both walked 
steadily on until they reached the guns, to which they 
were bound, when one of them requested that some 
rupees he had on his person might be saved for his rela- 
tions. The Brigadier answered: ' It is too late! ' The 
word of command was given; the guns went off simul- 
taneously, and the two mutineers were launched into 
eternity. ... I carefully watched the Sepoys' faces to 
see how it affected them. They were evidently startled 
at the swift retribution which had overtaken their com- 
rades, but looked more crestfallen than shocked or hor- 
rified, and we soon learnt that their determination to 
mutiny, and make the best of their way to Delhi, was 
in no wise changed by the scene they had witnessed." 

This novel punishment would thus seem to have 
failed in its calculated deterrent effect upon 
onlookers, which was its main and ostensible 
justification though the author thinks it 
" probably the most humane, as being a sure 
and instantaneous, mode of execution." 

Of the siege and storming of Delhi, in which 
he participated with distinguished gallantry, 
and where he first had the opportunity of dis- 
playing those marked qualities of leadership 
which advanced him in time to the rank of 
Commander-in-Chief in India, Lord Roberts 
gives a graphic account, which is too detailed 
to be summarized here. Special tributes are 
paid to the bravery of the natives who served 
in the ranks of the British ; and with charac- 
teristic kindness the writer does not forget to 
mention the good conduct of those whose merits 
usually escape notice. His native servants, he 
says, behaved admirably. 

" The Khidmatgar (table attendant) never failed to 
bring me my food under the hottest fire, and the saices 
(grooms) were always present with the horses whenever 
they were required, apparently quite indifferent to the 



risks they ran. . . . Mine was not a solitary instance; 
not only the officers' servants, but the followers belong- 
ing to European regiments, such as cook-boys, saices 
and bhisties (water-carriers), as a rule, behaved in the 
most praiseworthy manner, faithful and brave to a de- 
gree. So much was this the case, that when the troopers 
of the 9th Lancers were called upon to name the man 
they considered most worthy of the Victorian Cross, an 
honor which Sir Colin Campbell proposed to confer upon 
the regiment to mark his appreciation of the gallantry 
displayed by all ranks during the campaign, they unan- 
imously chose the head bhistie ! " 

Delhi fell or, rather, its last stronghold, 
the royal palace, was taken on September 20, 
1857; and on the day following, the King, the 
last of the Moghul Emperors, was made pris- 
oner, and his two sons were slain (we cannot 
think justifiably) by the hand of their captor. 
Says the author : 

" I went with many others the next day to see the 
King; the old man looked most wretched, and as he evi- 
dently disliked intensely being stared at by Europeans, 
I quickly took my departure. On my way back I was 
rather startled to see the three lifeless bodies of the 
King's two sons and grandson lying exposed on the stone 
platform in front of the Kotwali. On enquiry I learnt 
that Hodson had gone a second time to Humayun's 
tomb that morning with the object of capturing these 
princes, and on the way back to Delhi had shot them 
with his own hand an act which, whether necessary or 
not, has undoubtedly cast a blot on his reputation. His 
own explanation of the circumstance was that he feared 
they would be rescued by the mob, who could easily 
have overpowered his small escort of 100 sowars, and it 
certainly would have been a misfortune bad these men 
escaped. . . . My own feeling on the subject is one of 
sorrow that such a brilliant soldier should have laid 
himself open to so much adverse criticism. Moreover, 
I do not think that, under any circumstances, he should 
have done the deed himself, or ordered it to be done in 
that summary manner, unless there had been evident 
signs of an attempt at a rescue." 

The doer of this triple murder (for such it 
clearly was) was killed in a subsequent engage- 
ment ; and the story was current that he was 
killed in the act of looting the Begum Kothi 
(royal palace) at Lucknow. This story General 
Roberts disproves. The British left Delhi on 
September 24 ; and the sight in the streets of 
the fallen city as the army filed through them 
by the early morning light was gruesome 
enough. 

" Our way from the Lahore gate by the Chandni 
Chauk led through a veritable city of the dead ; not a 
sound was to be heard but the falling of our own foot- 
steps; not a living creature was to be seen. Dead bodies 
were strewn about in all directions, in every attitude 
that the death-struggle had caused them to assume, and 
in every stage of decomposition. We marched in silence, 
or involuntarily spoke in whispers as though fearing to 
disturb those ghastly remains of humanity. The sights 
we encountered were horrible and sickening to the last 
degree. Here a dog gnawed at an uncovered limb;

there a vulture, disturbed by our approach from its 
loathsome meal, but too completely gorged to fly, flut- 
tered away to a safer distance. In many instances the 
positions of the bodies were appallingly life-like. Some 
lay with their arms uplifted as if beckoning, and, indeed, 
the whole scene was weird and horrible beyond descrip- 
tion. Our horses seemed to feel the horror of it as 
much as we did, for they shook and snorted in evident 
terror." 

After Delhi came the engagements at Aligarh 
and Agra ; and during the halt at Agra the 
author first saw the Taj Mahal. Of this pearl 
of Eastern architecture like that other famous 
tomb on the Appian Way, the memorial of a 
husband's devotion to a dead wife he says : 

"I will not attempt to describe the indescribable. 
Neither words nor pencil could give to the most imagin- 
ative reader the slightest idea of the all-satisfying 
beauty and purity of this glorious conception. To those 
who have not already seen it, I would say: ' Go to India. 
The Taj alone is worth the journey.' " 

On October 26, Cawnpore was reached. 

" We now for the first time heard the miserable ' story 
of Cawnpore.' . . . Our visit to this scene of suffering 
and disaster (the barracks) was more harrowing than 
it is in the power of words to express ; the sights which 
met our eyes, and the reflections they gave rise to, were 
quite maddening, and could not but increase tenfold the 
feelings of animosity and desire for vengeance which 
the disloyalty and barbarity of the mutineers in other 
places had aroused in the hearts of our British soldiers. 
Tresses of hair, pieces of ladies' dresses, books crumpled 
and torn, bits of work and scraps of music, just as they 
had been left by the wretched owners on the 27th of 
June, when they started for that terrible walk to the 
boats provided by the Nana as the bait to induce them 
to capitulate." 

Lord Roberts bore a distinguished part in 
Sir Colin Campbell's memorable relief of 
Lucknow. The desperate character of the fight- 
ing in the environs of the city, before the junc- 
tion with Havelock and Outram in the Resi- 
dency was affected, is well illustrated by the 
following description of the scene in the Sik- 
andarbagh a strong post held by 2000 muti- 
neers. The gateway had been forced ; and 
through this and a breach in the wall the British 
poured upon the doomed men trapped within. 

" There could be no thought of escape, and they 
fought with the desperation of men without hope of 
mercy, and determined to sell their lives as dearly as 
they could. Inch by inch they were forced back upon 
the pavilion, and into the space between it and the north 
wall, where they were all shot or bayoneted. There they 
lay in a heap as high as my head, a heaving, surging 
mass of dead and dying inextricably entangled. It was 
a sickening sight, one of those which even in the heat of 
battle and the flush of victory make one feel strongly 
what a horrible side there is to war. The wretched 
wounded men could not get clear of their dead com- 
rades, however great their struggles, and those near the 
top of the ghastly pile of writhing humanity, vented 
their rage and disappointment on every British officer 



who approached by showering upon him abuse of the 
grossest description." 

Among the heroic deeds recorded in the story 
of the storming of the Sikandarbagh is that of 
a Mahomedan Subadar of the 4th Punjab 
Infantry. 

" The enemy having been driven out of the earthwork, 
made for the gateway, the heavy doors of which were 
being closed, when the Mahomedan pushed his left arm, 
on which he carried a shield, between them, thus pre- 
venting their being shut ; on his hand being badly 
wounded by a swordcut, he drew it out, instantly thrust- 
ing in the other arm, when the right hand was all but 
severed from the wrist." 

Lord Roberts closes his account of the Mu- 
tiny (which forms the bulk of the first volume) 
with two instructive chapters in which he 
attempts to answer the questions, " What 
brought about the Mutiny ? " and " Is there 
any chance of a similar rising occurring again?" 
The Mutiny was not, he thinks, as is commonly 
believed, primarily a Sepoy revolt, a mere up- 
rising of native soldiers against their foreign 
officers. Beneath it and logically prior to it 
lay the profound discontent of the more influ- 
ential classes among the native civilian popula- 
tion with measures of reform necessarily, if 
sometimes tactlessly and prematurely, imposed 
by the British, which measures they foresaw 
must eventually prove fatal to a social and 
religious regime which they held sacred, and 
with which their own hereditary class superior- 
ities and privileges were bound up. 

" The prohibition of sati (burning widows on the 
funeral pyres of their husbands) ; the putting a stop to 
female infanticide; the execution of Brahmins for cap- 
ital offences ; the efforts of missionaries and the protec- 
tion of their converts ; the removal of all legal obstacles 
to the remarriage of widows ; the spread of western and 
secular education generally; and, more particularly, the 
attempt to introduce female education, were causes of 
alarm and disgust to the Brahmins, and to those Hindus 
of high caste whose social privileges were connected 
with the Brahminical religion." 

Other causes of discontent, such as the alleged 
unfairness of the land settlement, and the an- 
nexation of Oude (which naturally aroused the 
jealousy of the lesser powers), are enumerated ; 
but everything tends to show that the mutiny 
was the result of a deep-seated movement for 
the overthrow of British rule in India. The 
native aristocratical and sacerdotal classes saw 
their ancient status and influence (resting, of 
course, on a basis of popular ignorance, supine- 
ness, and superstition) threatened by the Brit- 
ish policy of general amelioration and enlighten- 
ment ; and they sank their differences to unite 
against the common enemy. Their main plain 
of action was to incite the native soldiery to 



82 



[Feb. 1, 



revolt, by spreading among them reports that 
the authorities meant to strike at their caste 
and their religion by such devices as the issue 
of the polluting cartridges. Thus does Sir 
George Campbell's dictum, " The Mutiny was 
a sepoy revolt, not a Hindu rebellion," seem to 
involve a misconception. 

" Is there any chance of a mutiny occurring 
again ? " Lord Roberts answers this question 
by stating how, in his judgment, such a calamity 
may best be guarded against : 

" (1) By never allowing the present proportion of 
British to Native soldiers to be diminished or the disci- 
pline and efficiency of the Native army to become slack. 
(2) By taking care that men are selected for the higher 
civil and military posts whose self-reliance, activity, and 
resolution are not impaired by age, and who possess a 
knowledge of the country and of the habits of the peo- 
ples. (3) By recognizing and guarding against the 
dogmatism of theorists and the dangers of centralization. 
(4) By rendering our administration on the one hand 
firm and strong, on the other hand tolerant and sympa- 
thetic; and last, but not least, by doing all in our power 
to gain the confidence of the various races, and by con- 
vincing them that we have not only the determination, 
but the ability, to maintain our supremacy in India 
against all assailants." 

These cardinal points never lost sight of, there 
is little chance, the author thinks, of any fresh 
outbreak threatening the stability of British 
rule in India. 

In 1859 Lord Roberts visited England, 
where, he says quaintly, " I found my fate in 
the shape of Nora Bews," and where he re- 
ceived from the hands of the Queen herself the 
Victoria Cross. That coveted token of dis- 
tinguished bravery in the field never graced a 
more humane and chivalrous breast. Lord 
Roberts took part in the Umbeyla expedition, 
in 1863, and in the Abyssinian expedition, in 
1867; and in 1868 he acted as the bearer of 
Sir R. Napier's final despatches to England 
after the victory at Magdala. In 1877 he was 
appointed by Lord Lytton Chief Commissioner 
of the trans- Indus tract, which had been de- 
tached from the Punjab government. About 
one-third of Volume II. is taken up by the 
account of the Afghan War, including the bril- 
liant passage of the Peiwar Kotal, the Cava- 
gnari episode, and the famous march from 
Kabul to Kandahar, which is usually rated as 
Lord Roberts's principal military achievement. 
After the victory at Kandahar he was made a 
G. C. B., and appointed Commander-in-Chief 
of the Madras Army. In 1885 he succeeded 
his old companion in arms, Sir Donald Stuart, 
as Commander-in-Chief in India ; and in 1892 
he was raised to the peerage, with a title com- 



memorating his latest and most important mili- 
tary service to his country. Lord Roberts's 
final departure from India, in 1893, elicited a 
long series of farewell addresses which testified 
in the warmest terms to the universal affection 
and respect in which he was held by the resi- 
dents in that country, Native and foreign, mili- 
tary and civilian. In the heart of the private 
soldier he has ever held an especially warm 
place there being in the entire British Army 
no officer with whom " Tommy Atkins " so 
cheerfully casts his lot in peace or war as gal- 
lant and unassuming " little Bobs." England 
has been magnificently served in her Indian 
Empire, and such names as Clive, Hastings, 
Watson, Coote, Lawrence, Havelock, Outram, 
Campbell, stand high on her roll of honor. 
But higher, we think, than most of these names 
in the honorable distinction of having sought 
England's advantage in India only so far as that 
advantage is compatible with the rights and 
well-being of the Native, stands that of Lord 
Roberts of Kandahar. 

Lord Roberts's second volume throws no 
little light upon the new conditions brought 
about by the Russian advance towards Herat 
an advance for which he is not inconsistent 
enough to censure Russia. Her progress 
towards the South East has been in the main 
analogous to England's towards the North 
West. In each direction barbarism has inevit- 
ably given way before the approach of a civil- 
ized race ; and it is not unreasonable to hope 
that when the further advance of each power is 
barred by the presence of the other a frontier 
acceptable to both may be established. Russia's 
gradual march Indiawards need not necessarily 
imply that she has " designs on India," since 
advance she must. 

We shall close our review of these well made 
and finely illustrated volumes by quoting the 
pregnant remark of an astute Hindu gentleman 
touching the " Ilbert Bill " and the moot ques- 
tion as to the probable effect of British with- 
drawal from India. 

" Why do you English raise these unnecessary ques- 
tions ? It is your doing, not ours. We have heard of 
the cry, ' India for the Indians,' which some of your 
philanthropists have raised; but you have only to go to 
the Zoological Gardens and open the doors of the cages, 
and you will very soon see what would be the result of 
putting your theory in practice. There would be a 
terrific fight amongst the animals, which would end in 
the tiger walking over the dead bodies of the rest.' 
Whom,' I inquired, ' do you consider to be the tiger ? ' 
' The Mohammedan from the North,' was his reply."

EGGLESTON'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED 
STATES.* 

Dr. Eggleston's first volume of his proposed 
" History of Life in the United States " pre- 
sents the results of sixteen years of unwearied 
search among original documents bearing upon 
the history of the American colonies up to the 
middle of the seventeenth century. Three 
" books," dealing with the Virginia colony, the 
Pilgrims and Puritans, and the Maryland, 
Rhode Island, and Connecticut settlements, are 
divided into convenient paragraphs, which have 
abundant illustration and comment in maps and 
suggestive notes or " Elucidation." The title 
of the volume and the nature of the work out- 
lined bring to mind both Mr. Fiske's " Begin- 
nings of New England " and Prof. McMaster's 
" History of the People of the United States "; 
but the latter writer began his work with the year 
1784, and the former touched only a few points 
which are carefully considered by Mr. Eggles- 
ton. As a painstaking study of beginnings, 
based upon original material, and apparently in 
no wise affected by the conclusions of contem- 
porary writers, Mr. Eggleston's work is a dis- 
tinct contribution to our historical literature. 

The first book, dealing with the experiments 
on the James, gives an excellent idea of the 
romantic age in which American exploration 
was begun. A people which rejoiced in gaily 
colored vestments and took delight in showy 
pageants, appreciated likewise an exuberance 
in literature, and confidently expected from 
each wanderer into " strange parts " tales of 
wonderful adventures and stories of peculiar 
animals, plants, and men, which thrilling nar- 
rations served to inspire other seamen and 
fortune-hunters with longings. Two motives 
were powerful : one, the desire to search for 
the new way to India ; the other, the hope of 
finding mines of precious metal. Hither and 
thither, by sea and on land, explorers made 
their way in Eastern North America, making 
valuable discoveries, which for the time were 
overlooked, as with feverish eagerness they 
pressed westward, following the elusive objects 
of their search, pioneer pathfinders for later 
generations of restless ones who were to push 
to the South Sea overland, and, as the Argo- 
nauts of '49, were to get reward at last, when 
the sunny fountains of California rolled down 
their golden sands.

and Rise of the Earliest English Settlements in America, with 
special reference to the Character of the People. By Edward 
Eggleston. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



These two motives had behind them, at the 
bottom of all English adventure, rivalry for 
Spain ; cupidity, patriotic feeling, and religious 
zeal, manifested by the first comers, being due 
to that feeling. To get a share of the wealth 
from the fabled mines, to add to the glory of 
England, to meet the charge that the English 
Church lacked the Romish zeal for the conver- 
sion of the heathen, such were the desires for 
which hatred of Spain furnished the impulse. 
The trading companies that found their model 
in the prosperous associations for the develop- 
ment of other parts of the world .manifested 
the same spirit which later led to paper towns 
in agricultural regions and to mediaeval models 
for government in the ricefields of the Caro- 
linas. They sought to foster wine, silk, silk- 
grass, glass, iron, and timber industries, while 
they resisted steadily all attempts to introduce 
the cultivation of tobacco, which was so easy to 
raise and brought wealth in after years. 

In the presence of such a spirit the Virgin- 
ians are left ; while in the second book the stu- 
dent is led to the homes and haunts of Pilgrim 
and of Puritan. Some pictures have recently 
been presented, by Mr. Brown in " The Pilgrim 
Fathers of New England and their Puritan 
Successors," by Mr. Byington in " The Puri- 
tan in England and New England," and, at an 
earlier time, by Mr. Campbell with special pur- 
pose in " The Puritan in England, Holland, 
and America"; but there is room for Mr. 
Eggleston's story. It is a calm and dispassion- 
ate narrative ; there is no halo of glory ; there 
is no clouding of judgment by the events of 
later days ; but step by step the path of the 
wanderers is trodden again, and the Pilgrim 
and the Puritan live in our presence as men of 
their own day and generation. The motives 
which impelled them were essentially different 
from those which operated in Virginia, the 
desire to establish a church after their own 
notions being potent, the organization of the 
Pilgrims having reflex influence upon the Puri- 
tans in whose plans there was much of the com- 
mercial element. 

The Northern settlers are left at the very 
threshold of their American experience ; while 
in the third book attention is paid to the Cath- 
olic movement in Maryland, to the case of Roger 
Williams, and to the several Connecticut set- 
tlements. If criticism were to find place in 
comment upon so excellent a study as Dr. Eg- 
gleston's, it might rest here ; for the story is not 
so well told, there is not that careful attention 
to proportion, and the resulting impressions are 



84

not so distinct, as in the other sections of the vol- 
ume. But perhaps judgment should be withheld 
until later chapters develope the life of these 
people, and the far-reaching influences of such 
feeble beginnings are traced in the history un- 
der the king and in the conditions of the Na- 
tional period. 

The first thought of every reader of the an- 
nouncements of this first volume of the " His- 
tory of Life in the United States " probably 
was, that it would consist of an elaboration of 
the stories so entertainingly told by Dr. Eggles- 
ton in " The Century " a few years ago. One 
leaves the volume, after examination, with ad- 
miration for the thoroughness of investigation, 
which has found the roots of things, and has 
cast aside for the present the entertaining and 
the amusing for the deeper study of the char- 
acter of the fathers of our country. 

FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON. 



A NEW CLASSICAL, DICTIONARY.* 



The accomplished editor of " The Bookman " 
and Professor of Latin in Columbia College 
has completed in his leisure hours a labor which 
would have sorely tasked the undistracted en- 
ergies of a less versatile scholar. The new 
" Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature 
and Antiquities," edited by Mr. Harry Thurs- 
ton Peck, is nothing less than an abridged 
encyclopaedia of classical philology, in all its 
branches, between two covers. The student 
will find here under one alphabet virtually all 
the topics treated in the three great works of 
Smith, together with much useful information 
which they do not pretend to supply, on such 
subjects, e. g., as the History of Philology, the 
Science of Language, Libraries, First Editions, 
etc., etc. And for all this, with the exception 
of a limited number of contributions acknowl- 
edged in the preface, "the editor is himself 
responsible." But the age of miracles is past ; 
and closer scrutiny reveals, what the preface 
frankly admits, that the work has been mainly 
compilation in the original sense of the word. 
A large proportion of the longer articles are 
abridged from Smith, by the simple process of 
omission of some of the more technical sen- 
tences and paragraphs. Hundreds of the minor 
articles are copied verbatim (with slight biblio- 
graphical additions) from the translation of 

* HARPER'S DICTIONARY OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND 
ANTIQUITIES. Edited by Harry Thureton Peck, M.A. Illus- 
trated. New York : Harper & Brothers. 



Seyffert made by Messrs. Nettleship and 
Sandys. Hundreds of others are closely based 
upon Seyffert, but enriched by interpolation 
from recent French and German authorities, 
enlivened by modernisms or Americanisms, and 
brought down to date by bibliographical notes. 

It is only fair to say, however, that the book 
which results from this process contains incom- 
parably more information than Seyffert, and is 
of course accessible to many students whose 
limited purses or patience would prevent their 
consulting the seven volumes of Smith. One 
feels throughout the presence of a vigorous and 
alert intelligence behind the scissors. The 
fifteen hundred or more illustrations have been 
carefully chosen from a great many sources, and 
are excellently reproduced. The type is clear 
and agreeable to the eye. The consultation of 
the work is facilitated by numerous cross-refer- 
ences, and by the insertion in their alphabetical 
places of the English equivalents of technical 
Greek and Latin terms. Whatever lapses (in- 
separable from the compilatory method) close 
scrutiny may reveal to the critical scholar, it is 
safe to say at once that the book as it stands is 
by far the most serviceable single volume of 
the kind in existence for the needs of the young 
student, the general reader, and the isolated 
teacher who dwells remote from libraries. 

Further appreciation of the work would re- 
solve itself into discussion of the sources of the 
editor's material and his judgment in the dis- 
tribution of his space. The value of all the arti- 
cles is greatly enhanced by the careful bibli- 
ography. Sometimes, it is true (e. g., in the 
articles Vesta and Theatrum), this bibliography 
seems to be merely an external appendage, and 
is not worked into the treatment of the subject ; 
but in the main defective or inadequate articles 
are skilfully rounded out and brought down to 
date by the insertion of an apt sentence or 
paragraph taken from the recent literature of 
the subject. The greatest freshness and inde- 
pendence of treatment appears in the literary 
articles, a fair proportion of which are appar- 
ently from Professor Peck's own pen. The 
claim of the preface that "everywhere the 
effect of ancient literature upon the literature 
of modern times has been noted " is hardly 
borne out by the rather meagre allusions in the 
body of the work. A large proportion of these, 
occurring in the mythological articles, are 
taken directly from Gayley's " Classical Myths 
in English Literature," which should have been 
mentioned among the other authorities enumer- 
ated in the preface.

Scholars will perhaps regret that in the ar- 
ticles abridged from Smith, the editor has 
dropped so many of the references to the orig- 
inal sources. Such references occupy little 
space. They are indispensable to the teacher 
or investigator, and insensibly lead the beginner 
to a more independent and robust scholarship. 
In fact, we are not sure that the ideal classical 
dictionary for the serious student would not 
consist simply of a complete collection of the 
sources. An austere censor might also observe 
that, despite his practised literary hand, the 
editor in abridging sometimes omits, along with 
technicalities which can be spared, qualifications 
and reservations which careful scholarship de- 
mands. 

Misprints and minor positive errors are per- 
haps no more frequent than was inevitable in 
dealing with such a mass of detail. We note 
wrong accentuation or spelling of Greek words 
on pp. 1303, 407, 432, 420, 701, 715, 870, 
576, 1165, 1156, 1510, 1032, 1261. Other 
misprints are Hia for Ilia, 594 ; to wit for 
to which, 1443 ; or for of, 1223 ; you for your, 
1161 ; Rumfel for Rumpel, 1263 ; patrem for 
putrem, 1136 ; animatium for animantium, 
1136 ; celeres liquidum for liquidum, celeres, 
1136 ; false listening for false witness (?), 
1011 ; Les Dimnites de Victoire for de la 
Victoire, 1096. The reference to Eleihyia 
(sic), p. 137, should be to Hithyia. Under 
capitis deminutio the student is referred to 
caput instead of to deminutio ; elsewhere the 
word is spelled diminutio. The reference s. v. 
Borysthenes, to Olbiopolis, should be to Olbia. 
The reference s. v. Antlia to Lucretius, v. 
317, should be v. 516. The reference to ^Eschy- 
lus Eumen, 522, for Athene Hygiea, is unin- 
telligible. The Danaides did not " draw water 
with perforated vessels," but poured water into 
a perforated vessel, as the illustration shows. 
The myth of Ascalaphus is told after Ovid met, 
5. 540, but with a reference to Apollodorus. 
The French works cited under " School of Alex- 
andria" all treat of the neo-Platonic philosophy, 
and not of the subject of the article. The " un- 
edited work of Damascius " has been edited by 
Kuelle. We should be pleased to see the au- 
thority for the statement that the name Anti- 
nomian was often given to Hippias, and for the 
assertion that the Octavia " perhaps may date 
from A.D. 1." We miss references to Diels 
s. v. Simplicius, to Pater in connection with 
Demeter, Cupid and Psyche, or Apuleius, to 
Way's translation of Euripides, to Breal s. v. 
Cacus, to Professor Wright s. v. Cylon for 



whom the old date is given, and a minor arti- 
cle here and there, as perhaps, Tetrapolis, Oxy- 
lus, Demogorgon. We detect the hand of an 
assistant in the misleading observation that 
" the story of Prometheus has been made the 
subject of two fine poems by Shelley and by 
Mrs. Browning." It seems a poor economy of 
space to repeat, when a cross-reference would 
suffice, large illustrations, such as the Villa of 
Hadrian, the temple of Zeus at Olympia, the 
head of Sesostris, the Coliseum, etc. Hasty 
revision is probably responsible for the repeti- 
tion with slight additions s. v. Rutilius of the 
article Namatianus as for the second article on 
Hithyia given in the appendix. The derivation 
of Bravo from brabeum is surely prescientific. 
It is a part of the police duty of reviewing to 
record trifles like these, but it is hardly neces- 
sary to repeat that they do not materially im- 
pair the value or impugn the general accuracy 
of the work. 

Finally, despite our appreciation of a skil- 
fully executed, laborious, and useful piece of 
bookmaking, we cannot suppress the wish that 
Professor Peck and his publishers had judged 
it practicable to make of the book a truly inde- 
pendent and representative work of American 
scholarship. Articles like Professor Gilder- 
sleeve's Pindar, Professor Seymour's Homer, 
Professor Earle's Athence, Dr. Cooper's Sermo 
Plebeius, Professor Wheeler's linguistic arti- 
cles, to say nothing of the original contribu- 
tions of the editor offer ample evidence that 
our scholars need not, unless they choose, limit 
themselves to the translation, compilation, and 
adaptation of the works of others.

A LAST VOLUME FROM WALTER PATER.* 



A year or more ago, when Pater's " Miscellaneous 
Studies " appeared, those who looked through the 
bibliography remarked that everything there noted 
in one magazine or another was now safely gathered 
into garner except " Gaston de Latour," a story 
which had run five months in " Macmillan's," and 
an article on Giordano Bruno, which had appeared 
in " The Fortnightly." Those who had read both, 
or proceeded to read them, probably wondered why 
the latter essay had not been republished, for it was 
extremely interesting, and of great value in helping 
to a right understanding of Pater's ideas. The 
unfinished romance, one may have thought, was not 
republished because it was unfinished. Few could

Walter Pater. New York : The Macmillan Co.

THE DIAL,

have guessed that these two pieces were parts of the 
same whole. 

Such, however, seems to have been the case. In 
the volume lately published we have u Gaston de 
Latour " as it may be read in " Macmillan's "; we 
have the essay on Giordano Bruno remodelled, so 
that its connection with the rest is plainer ; and we 
have an intermediate chapter from Pater's unpub- 
lished papers printed " to fill the gap which it was 
designed to occupy in his scheme, and to indicate 
the direction which the development of the story 
would ultimately have taken." The volume result- 
ing is one that lovers of Pater will be glad to have : 
it completes the list of his works, for no more of 
his papers are to be published ; it has that curious 
and pathetic interest that always attaches to the 
unfinished work of a great writer ; and in itself it 
contains much that is not far behind Pater's finest 
and most careful work. 

The story was written at a time when Pater's 
thoughts had for some years found expression in 
fiction. For several years he had been occupied 
with " Marius the Epicurean "; in the years imme- 
diately following he had written the " Imaginary 
Portraits." The year after this volume appeared, 
namely in the summer of 1888,* the first part of the 
present volume came out, and the next year the last 
chapter was printed, as has been said, as an inde- 
pendent essay. Mr. Shadwell says that the story 
was begun " not long after the completion of Ma- 
rius "; and he is presumably good authority. How- 
ever this may be, " Gaston de Latour " is of the 
same period as " Marius," as Duke Carl of Rosen- 
mold and Sebastian van Storck. It shows us that 
Pater's mind revolved at this time about one sub- 
ject. Pater was not in those years the critic, the 
expounder, either of the Renaissance or of Greek 
Sculpture. He was more of a seeker, a speculator. 
His mind worked constantly about one question : 
What shall be thought by us who love art, of the 
place of art in life? 

Fifteen years before, Pater had said his say upon 
the matter and had been severely criticised, and, as 
he thought, misunderstood. The criticism, the mis- 
understandings, do not seem to have spurred him 
up to defend himself ; rather do they seem to have 
led him to think out the question anew. " While all 
melts under our feet," he had written in a well-known 
passage, " we may well catch at any exquisite pas- 
sion or any contribution to knowledge that seems 
by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a mo- 
ment, or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, 
strange flowers, and curious odours, or work of the 
artist's hands, or the face of one's friends." Excep- 
tion had been taken to the idea ; and Pater, accept- 
ing the possibility of error, had proceeded to con- 
sider a typical case. What would one be likely to 
do, under whose feet the fabric of the world seemed 
actually dissolving and passing away ? Marius lived 
in an age in which old ideas were vanishing into 
nothingness, and old beliefs were losing their hold ; 

* Not in 1889, as the varying Shadwell would have us believe . 



it was one of the great transition periods in the 
world's history the transition from Paganism to 
Christianity. In another such period, there is no 
reason to doubt, Pater seemed to stand himself. 
His mind turned naturally to another such transi- 
tion, the transition from Catholicism to Protestant- 
ism ; and he created Gaston de Latour, another 
young man in an age when everything was dissolv- 
ing beneath the feet. He created him, and then 
looked to see how he would deal with the situation. 
As a young man he had himself dealt with it; 
Marius had dealt with it ; it remained to see how 
Gaston would deal with it. Unfortunately, for one 
reason or another, the experiment failed. In 
" Marius " we have certainly a new answer, an 
advance upon " The Renaissance." But it was the 
advance of twelve years ; now, only three years after 
" Marius," it may well be that the subtle brain had 
not secreted enough material to develope a further 
answer. At any rate, Pater gave up the story, and 
we cannot form any adequate judgment of what 
would have been its outcome. " Gaston de Latour " 
must be explained by other of Pater's books ; itself, 
it explains little. The young thinker would seem to 
have come from devout Catholicism into a sort of 
skepticism wholly unlike anything in "Marius," from 
which he was aroused, one would say, by the logic 
of real events. But it is idle to try off-hand to un- 
ravel the secret, and the attempt would be of small 
value. 

Even as a fragment, " Gaston de Latour " has its 
great charm. If we have not the interest in the 
unfolding of character, the development of ideas, 
which give unity to " Marius," we have yet the pre- 
sentation of several phases of life and thought in a 
time and place for which Pater always had a great 
fondness. His work on the Renaissance, on Greek 
Art and Religion, on Plato, on English Literature, 
has all been gathered into distinct volumes ; but his 
studies on French subjects are scattered. He was 
fond of France ; in later life he usually spent his 
vacations in one part of the country or another. In 
" Gaston de Latour " we have several studies which 
call to mind much of his other work. The chapter 
on Ronsard may remind us of the essay on Bellay ; 
the chapters on Montaigne are almost as purely 
critical as the unfinished essay on Pascal ; the 
glimpses of the cathedral of Chartres will recall the 
studies of Amiens and Vezelay. Hence " Gaston de 
Latour," although it lacks much of such interest as 
comes from the careful entirety of " Marius," pos- 
sesses in some respects a more living interest. The 
young Roman was influenced by Marcus Aurelius, 
Aristippus, Lucian, Apuleius ; the young French- 
man by Ronsard, Montaigne, Giordano Bruno. 
These figures, of the time just following the Re- 
formation, seem nearer akin to us. 

The book is extremely characteristic of its author. 
I need not remark that the style is delicate, the 
thought subtle, the descriptions handled carefully in 
the manner of Corot, the criticisms fascinating and 
approximative. It must be enough to speak of one

thing noteworthy in this book* as in almost every 
other book of Pater's his way of conceiving action. 
Action was a thing that Pater had read of in books, 
but he could never have known it by experience. 
It seems almost impossible for him to conceive 
directly of anybody really doing anything. He has 
thousands of ways of implying that something was 
done, but we must always reach the facts by circum- 
stantial evidence. Pater holds the past in his mind, 
as Hamlet held the future, and action dissolves and 
disappears and is lost in thought. So then, when 
thought should have taken form in action in the 
action of belief, let us say, then it may well be 
that Pater was even more like Hamlet. We all 
remember how Hamlet was suddenly driven into 
action most unpremeditated and unconceived. So 
also are Pater's characters : Marius dies in the place 
of Cornelius, Sebastian is drowned while rescuing a 
child, Duke Carl is snatched away in the midst of a 
thunderstorm, Emerald Uthwart is entirely thought- 
less in his unfortunate act of bravery. It would 
seem almost as though Pater himself were always 
waiting for some intervention. And hence I sup- 
pose it was that after his first well-defined utter- 
ances in the Conclusion to "The Renaissance," 
Pater never spoke clearly out. His points of view 
changed, he sought constantly for more light; but 
the moment of assurance, once gone by, never came 
again. Pater can never be the positive master that 
Carlyle, Ruskin, Matthew Arnold have been to so 
many ; and he would probably have wished to have 
it so, for no one was less desirous than himself to 
offer a " facile orthodoxy " to those who believed in 
him. 

" Gaston de Latour " closes the list of Pater's 
works. It is as characteristic of its author as any 
of the volumes that have preceded it. It has his 
excellences, the thought, the criticism, the descrip- 
tions, the atmosphere, the beauty ; it has also his 
defects, the speculative involution and consequent 
super-refinement, which caused his indecision and 
his indefiniteness. Had it been completed, it might 
never have equalled " Marius "; but, as it stands, it 
contains much of its author's best quality. 
EDWARD E. HALK, JR. 

* I am not here thinking of the chapter on Saint Bartholo- 
mew's Eve, which cannot be mnch more than a sketch. Such 
seems to be Mr. Shadwell's opinion, and such is the natural 
inference from passages like that on page 159, beginning 
" Lodged in Abelard's quarter," which I can hardly believe 
to be more than a memorandum never worked up.

RECENT POETRY.* 

There can be no question that " The Seven Seas " 
is the book of the season, as far as poetry is con- 
cerned. Other writers of verse laboriously weave 
their fancies, or their bookish recollections, into a 
decorous rhythmical fabric ; Mr. Kipling, scorning 
the petty artifices and tricks of the craft, works 
himself to white-heat with some theme that has cap- 
tured his imagination, and then projects his person- 
ality without reserve into the product. The result 
is something so informed with energy, so genuinely 
and palpitatingly alive, that we forget about nar- 
row questions of technique, and are carried away 
by the stormy sweep of the song. When we recover 
from the first exhilaration, we sometimes turn back 
to examine what has so moved us, and then find 
many things at which to cavil. And finally, then, 
when judgment fully resumes its sway, we are com- 
pelled to recognize the defects of Mr. Kipling's

magnificent qualities, and to admit that his work 
does not often reach the higher altitudes of poetry, 
or give us that sense of pure and absolute beauty 
that we have a right to expect from the supreme 
artist. Mr. Kipling appeals to us most powerfully 
when he sings of the sea and of Imperial England ; 
yet, if we contrast his capricious and uneven treat- 
ment of these themes with the sustained power of 
Mr. Swinburne in dealing with them, we realize the 
difference between the writer whose work is shot 
with occasional flashes of genius, and the writer 
who is a great poet by the grace of God. In saying 
this, we have in mind Mr. Kipling at his best ; at 
his worst he is merely a maker of " syndicate copy " 
and a juggler in hybrid dialects. There is a good 
deal of Mr. Kipling's worst in " The Seven Seas," 
and nothing, we should say, of his utmost best. If the 
latter is to be sought anywhere, it should be in " A 
Song of the English," in such noble verse as this : 

" We have fed our seas for a thousand years 

And she calls us, still unfed, 
Though there 's never a wave of all her waves 

But marks our English dead : 
We have strawed our best to the weed's unrest, 

To the shark and the sheering gull. 
If blood be the price of admiralty. 

Lord God, we ha' paid in full I " 

On the whole, in spite of a certain quantity of verse 
like the above, of the superb imaginative vision of 
such poems as the two " Chanteys," of the song of 
"The Native-Born," and of the new "Barrack- 
Boom Ballads " with their merry lilt, we are inclined 
to say that the volume containing all these things 
adds little to the author's reputation, and that his 
earlier collection is, in its total effect, the finer of 
the two. But we would by no means venture to 
prophesy that Mr. Kipling may not have in store 
even nobler work than he has yet given us. It is 
not decadence that is traceable in his new volume, 
but rather hurry, recklessness, and a lack of re- 
straint. These failings may be summed up in the 
single word exuberance, and that word connotes 
nothing irremediable. Mr. Kipling is now a minor 
poet, but to the twentieth century he may yet jus- 
tify himself as a major poet, and prove himself a 
worthy successor to the singers who have so glori- 
fied our literature during the generation now nearly 
at an end. 

Mr. Davidson's " New Ballads " suffer from the 
same causes that unfavorably affect Mr. Kipling's 
work. They are the outpourings of an exuberant 
and impatient nature, too readily satisfied with the 
forms in which the imagination first clothes itself. 
At times, they come near to being magnificent 
poetry ; but the high level is never for long sus- 
tained. Their matter is of such nature that the 
ethical question cannot be kept out of any serious 
discussion of their value, and the author seems to 
raise the standard of revolt against religious and 
moral conventions from a desire to be original and 
striking at any cost, rather than from conviction. 
His new version of the Tannhauser story, for ex- 



ample, may be " the most modern," and possibly 
" the most humane " interpretation of the legend, 
but it is not the deepest, and we are tempted to 
quote the indignant outburst of Dr. Ibsen's hero- 
priest when he hears from the lips of the Doctor 
the same sort of apology for the humane : 
" Humanity I That sluggard phrase 
Is the world's watchword nowadays." 

In Mr. Davidson's ballad, when the soul-stricken 
knight has confessed his sin, we are told that 
" The undivined, eternal Qod 

Looked on him from the highest heaven, 
And showed him by the budding rod 
There was no need to be forgiven." 

This is doubtless a comfortable philosophy, but its 
core is corruption. Mr. Davidson has put into his 
interspersed lyrics better and nobler poetry than he 
has put into his ballads. 

Most people who are familiar with the scientific 
work of the late Professor Romanes will be sur- 
prised to learn that the man of science was also a 
poet at least a poet in feeling and aspiration, if 
hardly a master in the art of rhythmical expression. 
The selection from his poems that now comes, un- 
der the editorial supervision of President Warren of 
Magdalen, is almost as great a surprise as was pro- 
vided, a few years ago, by the poems of Mr. W. E. 
H. Lecky. The poems by Romanes reveal an aspect 
of the author's thought almost unsuspected by the 
public at large, for " running through them all ap- 
pears the thread of his own character, his largeness 
and loftiness of spirit, his love of truth and of 
beauty through truth, his doubt yet his faith in doubt, 
above all his hunger and thirst after righteousness, 
a hunger and thirst most assuredly satisfied." These 
preparatory words from his editor and friend pre- 
pare the reader for the deeply religious tone of the 
poems that follow. They include, besides a lengthy 
rhymed " Tale of the Sea " and a portion of the 
privately-printed "Charles Darwin," something like 
fifty sonnets and miscellaneous pieces, faulty in many 
ways, yet so perfectly sincere and heartfelt as to dis- 
arm technical criticism. Our selection shall be from 
the tribute to Darwin : 

" For he was one of that small band 
Who in the waves of History 

Stand up, as island cliffs that stand 
Above the wide and level sea ; 

And time will come when men shall gaze 
That ever-changing sea along, 

To mark through dim and distant haze 
One rock that rises sheer and strong : 

And they will say, ' Behold the place 
Where true was steered the course of Thought ; 

For there it was the human race 
First found the bearings that they sought." 

Mr. Lawrence Housman's volume of verse entitled 
" Green Arras " bears in its forefront a graceful 
dedication to the poet's wife, from which we take 
the closing stanza : 

41 As grass to Love's grave, as a curtain 
Drawn over the dusk of Life's day, 
This weaving from fingers uncertain, 
This blending of colors astray 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

Yet tho' Time bring the touch of the spoiler, 
Or the years lay their dust on its sheen, 

This gift 's to the hand of the toiler, 
To make your name's music be seen 
Amid arras of green." 

Unfortunately, it is impossible to read these stanzas 
without recalling the dedication of the " Poems and 
Ballads," and the comparison with Mr. Swinburne 
is fatal. At best, they are but a weak imitation, 
while the interpolation of the penultimate verse 
almost ruins the structural beauty of the stanza. 
This is not the only piece in the volume to suggest 
the work of a greater poet of Morris, Rossetti, or 
Tennyson. Mr. Housman's diction is too strained 
and unmusical to be satisfactory, although now and 
then he shows that he can write simply and well. 
We could ask for nothing sweeter than this picture 
of " Autumn ": 

" Over her dreaming face she flings 

Forgetf ulness, nor seems to hear, 

Above the waning of her year, 
A passing sob of wood-doves' wings." 

Picturesqueness is, indeed, a marked characteristic 
of his verse, as is natural in the case of a poet who 
is primarily an artist in the graphic sense. 

Mr. Victor Plarr's verses are written, so the au- 
thor informs us, " In the Dorian Mood," which would 
seem to connote a certain severe simplicity. To our 
fancy, there is more of the Lydian than of the 
Dorian in his numbers, as the following little poem, 
called " Shadows," may serve to show : 

" A song of Shadows : never glory was 

But it had some soft shadow that would lie 
On wall, on quiet water, on smooth grass, 
Or in the vistas of the phantasy : 

" The shadow of the house upon the lawn, 
Upon the house the shadow of the tree, 
And through the moon-steeped hours unto the dawn 
The shadow of thy beauty over me." 

Mr. Plarr's poems are pretty fancies, many of them 
woven about historical or literary themes, with here 
and there a grave pure note of feeling that reveals 
the essentially poetic nature. 

Aside from a few miscellaneous pieces that occupy 
the closing pages, Mr. A. H. Beesly's new volume, 
" Danton and Other Verse," is a series of dramatic 
scenes from the French Revolution, with Danton as 
their central figure. The blank verse is tolerable 
but not extraordinary, as the following extract may 
witness : 

" Five years ago we breathed as breathe the beasts, 
Ate, drank, as they do, yoked and chained as they, 
We were not men our homes, our wives, our lives 
We held but at a master's will and pleasure ; 
He took his toll of them, we had his leavings ; 
To-day France stands unmanacled, and we 
Who freed her, seal her freedom with our blood." 

As this passage, spoken by Danton, indicates, the 
protagonist of our drama is represented as deserv- 
ing more of our respect than history has been will- 
ing to allow. Mr. Beesly informs us that he has 
for some time past been engaged upon a life of 
Danton, whom he believes to have been dealt with 
unjustly by most writers, and the dramatic scenes 



now published are to be regarded as chips from the 
historian's workshop. 

The " Poems " of Mr. Coutts reveal a reflective 
fancy, and are filled with philosophical questionings. 
This is particularly true of the "Essay" which 
leads off the series, and of a considerable number of 
the sonnets that follow. These pieces are correctly 
phrased, but have little of the grace of true poetry. 
The author does better when he puts philosophy 
aside, and writes of some simple and tender theme, 
as in the poem called " My Sister's Room." 

"She that dwells here her spirit doth transmit 

Into the very air ; a calmness steals 
Upon me, sitting where she 's wont to sit 

Or standing at the table where she kneels. 

Ah ! Could I only fancy what she feels 
When the near presence of her heavenly guide 

The Man divine, her reverie reveals. 
Here are her books ; and here her pen is plied 
In takes of love ; there, through the window wide, 

From wood and meadow floats a summer sound ; 
The thrushes pipe, the whispering waters glide ; 

Crowned is the vale with peace, as she is crowned. 
O virgin spirit of this quiet place, 
Inform me with thy restf ulness and grace ! " 

Mr. Coutts has the daring to make " Tithonus " the 
subject of one of his poems, which is not well- 
advised, although the poem is one of the best in his 
volume. 

Parody must be very good to be tolerable, and it 
was with some trepidation that we opened " The 
Battle of the Bays." But Mr. Seaman's daring 
soon justified itself, and we read his little book from 
cover to cover with increasing delight. The very 
first poem yields the following stanza, which needs 
no label : 

" Hushed now is the bibulous bubble 

Of lithe and lascivious throats ; 
Long stript and extinct is the stubble 

Of hoary and harvested oats ; 
From the sweets that are sour as the sorrel's 

The bees have abortively swarmed, 
And Algernon's earlier morals 
Are fairly reformed." 

The following, " from the Sanskrit of Matabili- 

waijo," is in Sir Edwin Arnold's best manner : 

" Breeze ! thou knowest my condition ; state it broadly, if you 

please, 
In a smattering of Indo-Turco-Perso- Japanese. 

" Say my youth is flitting freely, and before the season goes 
From the garden of my Tfitsi I am fain to pluck a rose. 

" Tell her I 'm a wanton Sufi (what a Sufi really is 
She may know, perhaps I count it one of Allah's mys- 
teries)." 

Mr. William Watson's reflections upon the appoint- 
ment of the latest Poet Laureate are thus brought 
to their inimitable close : 

" Hoarse in Penbryn are the how lings that rise for the hope 
of the Cymri ; 

Over her Algernon's head Putney composes a dirge ; 
Edwin anathematises politely in various lingos ; 

Davidson ruminates hard over a Ballad of Hell ; 
Fondly Le Gallienne fancies how pretty the Delphian laurels 

Would have appeared on his own hairy and passionate poll ; 
I, imperturbably careless, untainted of jealousy's jaundice, 

Simply regret the profane contumely done to the Muse ; 



THE DIAL

Done to the Muse in the person of Me, her patron, that never 
Licked Ministerial lips, dusted the boots of the Court ! 

Surely I hear through the noisy and nauseous clamor of 

Garlton 
Sohs of the sensitive Nine heave upon Helicon's hump ! " 

And for nearly a hundred delightful pages, Mr. 
Seaman beguiles us with as ready a wit as these 
extracts exhibit. His parodies and humorous poems 
upon subjects of contemporary interest rank with 
the best things of Calverley and Banner, almost 
with the immortal " Heptalogia " of Mr. Swinburne. 

Mr. Aldrich's new poem, " Judith and Holo- 
fernes," extends to about a thousand lines of blank 
verse, and is sustained upon a high level of thought 
and imagination, although it does not stir the pulses 
as the poet has often stirred them in his earlier 
work. The story is familiar enough, and the author 
has taken with it such liberties as the exigencies of 
his treatment seemed to require. The element which 
is wholly his own in his treatment of the character 
of Judith is " the note of tenderness with which the 
writer has here attempted to accent her heroism." 
The poem reaches its climax in the following fine 
passage : 

" Then Judith dared not look upon him more 
Lest she should lose her reason through her eyes ; 
And with her palms she covered up her eyes 
To shut him out ; hut from that subtler sight 
Within, she could not shut him, and so stood. 
Then suddenly there fell upon her ear 
The moan of children moaning in the streets, 
And throngs of famished women swept her by, 
Wringing their wasted hands, and all the woes 
Of the doomed city pleaded at her heart. 
As if she were within the very walls 
These things she heard and saw. With hurried breath 
Judith blew out the lights, all lights save one, 
And from its nail the heavy falchion took, 
And with both hands tight claspt upon the hilt 
Thrice smote the Prince of Asshur as he lay, 
Thrice on his neck she smote him as he lay, 
Then from her flung the cruel curved blade 
That in the air an instant flashed, and fell." 

We can hardly say that this poem will add to the 
reputation of Mr. Aldrich, but it is at least worthy 
of him, and serves once more to emphasize the fact 
that he has no superior among the living poets of 
America. 

Another little book put forth jointly by Mr. Bliss 
Carman and Mr. Richard Hovey is called " More 
Songs from Vagabondia." There is more careless 
and inartistic work in this volume than in its simi- 
larly-named predecessor, and only now and then a 
set of finished stanzas really deserving of print. At 
its best, as in " A Vagabond Song," it gives us but 
an echo of Mr. Carman's earlier and better work. 

" There is something in the autumn that is native to my 

blood 

Touch of manner, hint of mood ; 
And my heart is like a rhyme 
With the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time. 

" The scarlet of the maples can shake me like a cry 

Of bugles going by. 

And my lonely spirit thrills 

To see the frosty asters like a smoke upon the hills. 



" There is something in October sets the gypsy blood astir ; 

We must rise and follow her, 

When from every hill of flame 

She calls and calls each vagabond by name." 

This is the best that the book can do for us ; the 
worst is beneath notice. A word may be said for 
the song of " Hem and Haw," a delightfully humor- 
ous parody of Mr. Carman's own " Hack and Hew." 

The daring and the distinction, the production 
of strong effects by simple means, that characterize 
Emily Dickinson's poetry need no setting-forth at 
this late day. Take these versicles for example : 

" My life closed twice before its close ; 

It yet remains to see 
If immortality unveil 
A third event to me, 

" So huge, so hopeless to conceive, 

As these that twice befell. 
Parting is all we know of heaven, 
And all we need of hell." 

A reader who knew Miss Dickinson's work at all 
would place them instantly, so unmistakably did she 
stamp herself upon her least experiment in verse. 
We make the quotation from a " third series " of her 
poems, edited, like the others, by her friend, Mrs. 
Mabel Loomis Todd. 

Mrs. Todd also appears as editor of the poems of 
another of her departed friends, unnamed in the 
" Cycle of Sonnets " which now reveals him to the 
world. These sonnets are the songs of a lover, full 
of the passion of worship, and swelling with the 
rapture of a perfect joy. We may find space for 
but one of the more than fourscore that make up 
the cycle. 

" O sad-mouthed virgin with thy perfect face, 
And mystic glory of thy gleaming hair, 
With thy rapt eyes, I wonder how I dare 
Do aught, than, silent kneeling as for grace 
Before thy soul's white shrine, my own abase 
And with Love's rosary to count a prayer ! 
For every thought of thee, who art so fair, 
May win for me at last some lowly place. 
Around thy lips the tender shadows play, 
Prophetic of some woe that may be thine, 
Smile till thou shalt have smiled them all away 
And in thine eyes the look is so divine 
I need a thousand rosaries to pray, 
Poor human pilgrim, at thy heavenly shrine." 

And then, through every mood of tender and ex- 
ultant devotion, these sonnets wing their way until 
the death of the beloved one makes the world dark, 
and wrings from the bereft lover one cry of passion- 
ate grief so terrible as to strike the listener's soul 
with awe. These poems are treasure-trove indeed, 
and are worthy of a place beside the " Sonnets from 
the Portuguese " and the other supreme expressions 
of the love between man and woman that star our 
English poetry. They are almost too intimate and 
too sacred to bear the light of print, but literature 
would have been distinctly poorer had they not been 
given to the world. 

A new volume by Miss Thomas is always a pre- 
cious gift, and we find in " A Winter Swallow, with 
Other Verse " the same grave pure note as of old. 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



91 



A few lyrics and sonnets, with two long poems, 
make up the contents of this volume. " A Winter 
Swallow " is a dramatic scene from the legendary 
history of Sparta, and " Ginevra of the Amieri " is 
a narrative, in Spenserian verse, from the chronicles 
of mediaeval Florence. These two poems are minor 
masterpieces, and embody, with remarkable insight, 
the spirit of the periods with which they are respect- 
ively concerned. As regards the former, we hardly 
need at this day to emphasize the talent, if not the 
genius, which Miss Thomas displays when she aims 
to interpret and spiritualize some classical myth. 
The same power that is found in "A Winter Swal- 
low " may be seen in the sonnet " Antaeus," which 
we will reproduce : 

" The gods are on the lawless giant's track, 
With f ulmined bolts and arrows they pursue ; 
Yet, though they pierce his great heart thro' and thro', 
And though they stretch him on the torture-rack 
Till all his mighty thews and sinews crack, 
See what the ancient healing Earth can do 
How quick his ebbed powers she will renew, 
As to her vital bosom he sinks back ! 

"Take lesson from the Titan, O thou sage : 
Pain and confusion wait on him who pries 
Into the secret of the jealous skies. 
Yet, if thou wilt on airy quest engage, 
Bethink thee often of thine heritage 
Touch the sane Earth, where all thy safety lies ! " 

There is always matter for thought in what Miss 
Thomas writes, and if her verse seem over-austere 
it is never without the emotional tinge that trans- 
mutes thought into poetry. 

" From Avalon and Other Poems " is a small 
book of song, delicately wrought, and appealing to 
the gentler sentiments in a way that is pleasing 
rather than forceful. The title-poem will be remem- 
bered by readers of THE DIAL ; the others are lyr- 
ical, narrative, and memorial pieces upon the old 
themes of nature and the human soul. There is a 
strong undercurrent of religious feeling, which some- 
times rises to the surface, as in such lines as these 
from the poem " In Port ": 

" ' Sailor ! ' we cried, ' tell us where lies thy port ! ' 
And still came back the answer, clear and strong : 
' I know not where, yet am I homeward bound. 
This is His sea ; its pulses rise and fall 
As His breath moves them, and its currents set 
Steady and deep, to bear me where he will.' 
So he sailed on ; and once, when stars were large 
And luminous, through changeful purple mists, 
Rocked by slow waves that bore him from our sight, 
And calm with peace that lay too deep for smiles, 
He drifted gently to a palm-girt shore, 
And knew, at last, where God's fair islands lie." 

This lovely passage is fairly typical of the author's 
work, which is sweet and tender from beginning to 
end. 

There is nothing very distinctive about the small 
volume of verse entitled " A Quiet Road," by Miss 
Reese. We have a nature-lyric here, and there a 
bit of versified literary criticism ; now a touch of 
allegory, and then a slight expression of mediaeval 
feeling. It is all prettily done, but none of it makes 



a lasting impression. " A Memory " is a good ex- 
ample. 

" The rosy boughs tossed to the sky ; 

There, as I passed along, 
A girl's voice passionate and high 
Rang out in sudden song. 

" Across the darkening street it came, 

Young, throbbing, sad of fall ; 

I think old Homer heard the same 

By some ruined Smyrna wall. 

" Thereafter, with my memories few, 

That song was a sooth thing ; 
Yet went I back no more ; I knew 
That it was gone with Spring." 

Miss Irene Putnam's " Songs without Answer " 
are sweet ineffectual lyrics, the product of a deli- 
cately-cultured mind, and possessed in some meas- 
ure of the haunting quality of true song. We quote 
from the stanzas " In Winter." 

" There 's yet a gift that I would own, 

Life's ancient strength, austere, divine, 
Like something in the ice-girt stone, 
And something in the wind-swept pine ; 

" A power to praise the Winter stars 

Tho' all my veins be frost-represt, 
To bear the burden and the scars 
And shield some snow-bird in my breast." 

A page or two back in this review, " The Battle 
of the Bays " afforded a sort of interlude to lighten 
the over-serious tenor of our discussion, and oppor- 
tunity for another such interlude is provided by 
" The Acrobatic Muse " that has inspired the jocular 
strain of Mr. Munkittrick. It is something of a 
relief, after so much melody in minor key, to listen to 
such a song as the " Ballade of the Declining Year." 

"The butterfly has left the lea, 

Where golden-rods and asters blow ; 
No more the little honey-bee 

Swings on the lily to and fro. 

The rustling sheaf betokens snow, 
And from the poet's innermost 

Recesses doth this songlet flow 
There are no quail on last year's toast." 

The descent from poetry to prose is not often as 
abrupt as in the verses entitled " Dawn." 

" The air is clear and sweet as golden wine, 

Warmed by day's early beam ; 
The distant hills in rolling purple shine, 
And, from a poet's dream, 

" I wake to hear Myrtilla play a great 

Tattoo with vim and dash, 
Chopping the pickled beeve to formulate 
The matutinal hash." 

There are tucked away at the end of the book some 
clever imitations of Calverley, Locker, and others. 

" Roses red your features crest, 
In the east or in the west 

South or north ; 

There is naught so gay and sweet, 
So enchanting and petite, 

&c., 

" As yourself, for it 's as true 
As your loving eyes are blue 

You 're divine 

As when playing on the green 
With the lamb in May, 18

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



This sort of thing is mildly amusing, at least, and 
we welcome it as a diversion in the midst of a seri- 
ous task. 

Mr. Dunbar's " Lyrics of Lowly Life " gain an 
adventitious interest from the fact that their author 
is a full-blooded negro. In about a third of the 
pieces he writes in the dialect and with the accent 
of his race ; the remaining and greater fraction of 
the volume is made up of pieces that are in no way 
distinguishable from the effusions of minor poets 
everywhere that are neither better nor worse than 
those found in many of the other volumes comprised 
within the present review. Take " The Master- 
Player," for example : 

" An old, worn harp that had been played 
Till all its strings were loose and frayed, 
Joy, Hate, and Fear, each one essayed 
To play. But each in turn had found 
No sweet responsiveness of sound. 
Then Love the Master-Player came 
With heaving breast and eyes aflame ; 
The harp he took all undismayed, 
Smote on its strings, still strange to song, 
And brought forth music sweet and strong." 

This selection represents the average quality of 
Mr. Dunbar's work. It is correct and cultured, 
(except for the dialect numbers), deserving of re- 
spect, but hardly justifying the praise bestowed upon 
it by Mr. Howells in his introductory remarks. 

Dr. George M. Gould, who styles his book (and 
himself ? ) " An Autumn Singer," writes lyrics and 
sonnets in profusion, and makes them the vehicle 
for much philosophical speculation and meditative 
utterance. " The Sceptic's Consolation " is typical 
of his work : 

" What then abides in all this mystic dance 
Of seeming real and unreal, me, not me ? 
Our firmest faiths, the surest truths, we see 
Illusive fade, our sole inheritance 
The accident of fate, or fate of chance. 
The eye creates the thing it sees, yet we 
Slow learn that eye and subjectivity 
Are woof of dream and warp of circumstance. 

" The dream abides ! The law and fact of change ! 
The surety too that woven warp and woof 

Has loveliness for infinite delight. 
Know all mutation's laws, let range 
The eye their glories o'er, enough the proof 
Of world perdurable, in beauty dight." 

The thought of this sonnet is very fine and true, 
but the form leaves to be desired, and this special 
judgment is that which must be passed upon nearly 
all of Dr. Gould's verse. 

" The Book of the Hills," by Mr. 0. C. Auringer, 
is a small collection of pieces, many of them occa- 
sional, that now and then rise to clear and harmon- 
ious expression, as in these lines from " The Lamp 
of Hellas ": 

"There gleam our marble cities (domes and towers 
Flushed with Apollo's smile, divinest god ! ) 
Where stand our altars and our images. 
All these with godlike leisure, now are ours, 
Free sense and heart to worship, and the rod 
Of perfect law to guard our liberties." 

Much of Mr. Auringer's work is commonplace, and 



the contrast is very marked between the above verses 
and others that might be quoted did we wish to 
drive our moral home. 

Music is the inspiration of Mr. Sawyer's "Notes 
and Half-Notes." The writer hears the " Trau- 
merei," for example, shuts his eyes, and is straight- 
way transported to 

" A land where the nightingales sing to the roses 

Where the night is a-quiver with music outpoured ; 
Where the passion-flower burns and its rent heart discloses, 
And life's dissonance melts in a musical chord." 

He has similar visions when he hears various other 
compositions, and finds musical words in which to 
describe them. Of course, no one else is likely to 
see just the same things, for music, being the art 
universal, is all things to all men, and (unless it be 
programme-music) does not belong with bne set of 
pictures more than with another. In an interesting 
series of sonnets called "Musicians' Poets," Mr. 
Sawyer traces spiritual analogies between Heine 
and Schubert, Rossetti and Palestrina, Swinburne 
and Tschaikowsky, Musset and Massenet, Keats 
and Mendelssohn, Shelley and Chopin, Hugo and 
Wagner. In one or two of these cases, the combina- 
tion is certainly startling, but here again the author 
has a right to his own impressions, and is doing what 
hundreds of others, lovers of music and poetry alike, 
have caught themselves doing in meditative mo- 
ments. 

" This book is dedicated to any man, woman, or 
critic who will cut the edges of it, I have done the 
top." This note introduces Mr. E. H. Robinson's 
unpretentious pamphlet of verse, and we hasten to 
say, ignoring the implication that critics are epicene 
( a charge made once before by ' Christopher 
North "), that we have not only cut the pages, but 
would cut many more of the sort, and be grateful 
to the writer for a number of reasons. One reason 
for instance, is that he has furnished an apt text for 
the reviewer of minor poetry. 

" Oh, for a poet for a beacon bright 
To rift this changeless glimmer of dead gray : 
To spirit back the Muses, long astray, 
And flush Parnassus with a newer light : 
To put these little sonnet-men to flight 
Who fashion, in a shrewd mechanic way, 
Songs without souls that flicker for a day 
To vanish in irrevocable night." 

It would not be fair, at least relatively, to apply 
these verses to Mr. Robinson's own poems, which 
are far above the average in thought and expres- 
sion. They strike many grateful notes, and particu- 
larly the note of austere restraint that is so rarely 
heard in contemporary song. A striking example 
of this writer's workmanship is the close of his 
sonnet to " Veiiaine," surely the work of no " little 
sonnet-man." 

"Song sloughs away the sin to find redress 
In art's complete remembrance : nothing clings 
For long but laurel to the stricken brow 
That felt the Muse's finger ; nothing less 
Than hell's fulfilment of the end of things 
Can blot the star that shines on Paris now."

We are not quite prepared to say all this of Ver- 
laine himself, hut the doctrine is of wide application, 
and gives pause to the professional belittler of great 
and shining names. 

Mr. Herbert Bates, in his " Songs of Exile," 
voices the emotions of a soul transplanted from the 
mountains and the seashore to the monotonous 
plains of the Mississippi Valley. The note of exile 
is very insistent, recurring in many modulations. 
At one moment we are asked : 

" What speech have sulky sunflowers that star 
The prairie ridge afar 
To match the message childhood's daisy gave ? " 

At another we are told that 

"Song homes on hills, its power disdains 
The sordid plains ; its true domains 
Where riotous the wild wind thrills 
Its home, the hills!" 

If one wished to be very critical, he might retort 
that the wild winds are quite as riotous on the prai- 
ries as by the seashore, and that daisies (of a sort) 
may be found in both places. But without these 
half-imaginary contrasts Mr. Bates would have 
found no raison d'etre for his songs, and they are 
too good to be spared. Yet it is a little rough on 
his adopted home to say of it : 

"' We have delved the black of the prairie earth, 

The muck of the rotting sod, 

We have shared the drouth and the rain-rot dearth, 
We have sorrowed, have laughed with the devil's mirth, 
In a land that knew no God. 1 ' 

Tastes differ, and life on the prairies has its sombre 
aspects, no doubt, but we call to mind one charm- 
ing writer who calls his Kansas sketches " Tales of 
God's own country." 

Mr. Francis Sherman's " Matins " are mainly 
lyrics and ballads, simple but tense in diction, the 
expression of grave moods and melancholy imagin- 
ings. There is something fine and impressive about 
such a poem as " The Conqueror," with its picture 
of the knight stricken in the flush of victory, yet so 
full of the thought of his Lady that he will not see 
the figure of approaching death. 

** Yea, I must go. What ? Am I tired yet ? 
Let me lie here and rest my aching side. 
The thought of her hath made me quite forget 
How sharp his sword was just before he died." 

Mr. Sherman's poems will bear a close examination, 
from the group of four noble sonnets called " A 
Life " that opens the volume, to the " Te Deum 
Laudamus " that brings it to a close.

PROFESSOR W. M. Sloane's " Life of Napoleon Bona- 
parte," with its splendid series of illustrations, is now 
carried through its second volume by the Century Co. 
This volume confirms our previous favorable opinion of 
this magnificent publishing enterprise, and we can only 
repeat that it is a masterpiece of modern luxurious 
book-making, and presents the most exhaustive life of 
Napoleon yet written. Two more volumes are to fol- 
low. Messrs. McDonnell Brothers, Chicago, are the

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

M. Edmond Bird's " The Diary of a 
Citizen of Paris during 'The Ter- 
ror (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a work 
of enthralling interest and decided historical value. 
To the solid worth of history it unites the charm 
(if that term can be properly applied to a recital 
generally so grewsome) of romance. We do not 
mean to imply that M. Bird's book is to be ranked 
in the category of historical novels. There is no 
fiction about it, save the author's literary device of 
posing as an eye-witness of the scenes described and 
throwing his narrative into diary form. The as- 
sumption is well sustained throughout, and adds 
greatly to the readableness of the work. M. Bird 
is a historical writer of repute in his own land, and 
readers of Mr. Morse Stephens's history of the 
Revolution will remember the tribute therein paid 
to his " La Ldgende des Girondins " a work which, 
by the way, we wish someone would satisfactorily 
translate into English. M. Bird seems to have ex- 
ploited all sorts of out-of-the-way documents in pre- 
paring his work ; and the authorities have been 
thoroughly ransacked and carefully collated. He 
has read most of the newspapers of the period, and 
many of the pamphlets ; and particular attention 
has been paid to bills, posters, etc. Living thus, he 
says, " amidst these witnesses of events long past, it 
seemed to me that I had become their contemporary; 
that, like the ' awakened sleeper ' of poor Cazotte 
one of the first victims of the Terror I, too, 
walked in the streets of the Paris of '93 ; that I 
frequented its public places ; that, after a sitting of 
the Convention, I strolled into a cafd of the Maison 
Egalitd; that I mingled with the crowd in the 
squares and the theatres, waiting my turn with the 
people in front of the bakers'-shops, following them 
sometimes with a heavy heart and swimming eyes 
as far as the Place de la Revolution or the barrier 
of the Tron Renversd, where the tumbrel came jolt- 
ing along through the midst of the hooting mob, and 
heads fell to the cry of ' Vive la, Rbpublique ! ' ' 
M. Bird has sought to rid his mind of the gloomy 
visions thus conjured up, by committing them to 
paper ; and the printed result, marked by a Defoe- 
like exactitude, and relieved by an occasional out- 
burst of lyric eloquence such as a contemporary 
narrator stirred by those scenes of blood and tears 
might have indulged in, is replete with the atmos- 
phere of the period. A great number of notes and 
comments ostensibly editorial, and references to the 
authorities, are added, and should prove serviceable 
to careful readers. The writer's sympathies are 
confessedly royalist, yet his tone is fairly critical 
throughout. To all desiring an intimate knowledge 
and a vivid realization of the characteristic scenes 
and events of the political orgie known as the Reign 
of Terror we commend this book as by far the best 
of the shorter works on the subject adding that 
the judicious reader will doubtless do well to temper 
his impressions gained therefrom of the protagonists

of the drama by reference to the dispassionate pages 
of Mr. Morse Stephens. The true Marat, for 
instance, lies, we fancy, about midway between the 
mere homicidal monster of M. Bird, and M. Steph- 
ens's " statesman." The volumes are handsomely 
made, and contain two portraits, one of Marat and 
one of Potion. The latter name, by the way, is 
printed throughout without the accent. 



The explorer 
Nansen and 
his work. 



Mr. William Archer's translation of 
"Fridtioff Nansen: 1861-1893" 
(Longmans), by Herren W. C. BrOg- 
ger and Nordhal Rolfsen, is a timely volume, afford- 
ing some good preparatory matter for the many 
readers now eagerly awaiting the plucky explorer's 
forthcoming narrative of the voyage of the " Fram." 
Besides the biographical part proper, the book con- 
tains chapters by competent hands on " The Great 
Ice Age," " Arctic Expeditions from the Earliest 
Times," etc. These chapters are not perhaps 
strictly relevant ; but they help us to a wider view 
of Nansen and his work, so we are not going to 
quarrel with them on that score. The account of 
Nansen's character, and the story of his training 
from childhood up, are extremely fresh and graphic, 
and make one understand fully why he (half- 
athlete, half-scholar) of all others was peculiarly 
fitted for the work he undertook, and has now fairly 
accomplished despite the iterated and rather friv- 
olous objection that he did not, after all, " reach the 
Pole." The best answer to this cavil is found in 
Nansen's own words, in his preliminary address of 
1890 : " We do not set forth to seek for the math- 
ematical point which forms the northern end of the 
earth's axis ; to reach this particular spot is not, in 
itself, a matter of the first moment. What we want 
to do is to investigate the great unknown regions of 
the earth which surround the Pole ; and our investi- 
gations will have practically the same scientific value 
whether we reach the actual Pole itself, or pass at 
some distance from it curious though it would be, 
no doubt, to stand on the very Pole and be turned 
round with the earth on one's own axis, or see the 
oscillations of the pendulum describe an angle of 
exactly fifteen degrees in the hour." These are the 
words of the true investigator, and not of the mere 
notoriety-hunter ; and show that Nansen sought 
truth, rather than renown, in the frozen North. 
Happily, he has won his meed of both. The vol- 
ume closes with an account of the " Fram " and her 
crew, and of the preliminaries of the great expedi- 
tion generally. There are many pictures, including 
what may fairly be termed a Nansen gallery. 



History and 
criticism of 
ancient art. 



In the editing and translating of 
" The Elder Pliny's Chapters on the 
History of Art" (Macmillan), Miss 
Eugenie Sellers and Miss K. Jex-Blake have pro- 
duced a book both useful and, from some points of 
view, delightful. It will be found most useful to 
the special student of Greek art ; and he will know, 
without further assistance from us, how to appreciate 



it. We would gladly do something to further the 
circulation of the work among those who would not 
otherwise apprehend its value. The history of an- 
cient art which Pliny tucked into his " Natural His- 
tory " has been long known as one of the chief 
authorities on the painting and sculpture of the 
ancient world. Pliny has, in fact, no rival but 
Pausanias, and on the whole we think Pliny the 
more interesting of the two. In this volume he is 
made easily accessible. We have only those parts 
of his work which refer to ancient art ; we have a 
good translation (by Miss Jex-Blake) , and notes ; 
and we have a dissertation upon the sources of 
Pliny's information, by Miss Sellers. Almost every- 
body with any interest in the fine arts will find 
Pliny entertaining : he has been so vigorously read 
already that a great number of his anecdotes have 
got down into general circulation ; but still the his- 
tory as a whole is good reading, and it will be a good 
thing to read about Apelles and Pheidias at what 
is as nearly first-hand as one can easily get. The 
book will also be useful to a somewhat more limited 
range of readers, as giving an idea of present views 
on Greek art. Miss Sellers is already known as the 
editor of Furtwangler's " Masterpieces of Greek 
Sculpture," an excellent example of the "higher 
criticism " applied to the subject. Anybody who 
desires to get an idea of the spirit of modern 
scholarship in this matter will like to read Miss 
Sellers's introduction. It has always been known 
that Pliny, in this part of his work, was little more 
than a compiler. The problem is, then, to separate 
these chapters into their component parts, to assign 
each part to its rightful author, and to determine 
its authenticity. The task is performed with much 
neatness and ingenuity, with all the latest German 
authorities, and with some new results. We own 
to thinking some of the minor details of the method 
rather too rule-of-thumb, but that is not to the present 
point. The book is well made up, and has two 
indexes, artistic and museographic, which will be 
of great convenience to the student, if not so useful 
to the general reader.

Miss Florence A. Merriam when she went " A-Bird-

which lies cradled in the mountains a few miles 
north of San Diego, and had evidently nothing to 
do but make charming studies of her feathered 
neighbors from morning until night. Every bush 
and tree was peopled with them ; and from the back 
of her pony, with opera-glass in hand, she was able 
to observe them to admirable advantage. Thus, in 
the course of some weeks, in the nesting-season of 
1889 and 1894, she was enabled to identify nearly 
sixty species, most of which are peculiar to the 
Pacific slope, and to learn many interesting facts 
regarding their habits and lives. She enjoyed un-

usual facilities for watching the humming-birds 
while building their tiny mansions and rearing their 
twin babies. Indeed, these fairy-like beings ap- 
peared to swarm in this happy valley, and were con- 
stantly in view, buzzing about the flowers or busy 
with their domestic duties. The plainopepla, too, 
that rare bird of the Western coast, favored her with 
the perusal of interesting pages in its life history. 
Altogether her experience was one to be envied by 
bird-lovers, who, however, are grateful for the priv- 
ilege of sharing it at second-hand in this charming 
volume. Miss Merriam writes in a chatty way, as 
though she were talking with friends sure to under- 
stand and appreciate every detail of the story she 
narrates. The illustrations, from drawings and pho- 
tographs, are dainty and effective, combining fact 
and suggestion with genuine art feeling. The book 
is published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Mr. Schouier's *' is the personal element which 
historical and gives most value to Mr. James 
biographical paper,, gchouler's volume of "Historical 
Briefs " (Dodd, Mead & Co.). While the several 
papers on " Historical Style," " Historical Mono- 
graphs," " Historical Testimony," " Historical In- 
dustries," and " The Spirit of Research," have much 
interest as revealing the bent of mind of a veteran 
historian, there is more of attractiveness in the chap- 
ters that tell of Francis Parkman, of Lafayette's 
visit, of Monroe and the Rhea Letter, or of special 
phases of the life and times of James K. Polk. The 
climax of interest is reached in the biographical 
sketch of the historian himself. Just how and why 
a man who had made a success as a writer on legal 
themes was drawn to consideration of American 
constitutional and political subjects, makes a very 
pleasing story, one heightened in its effect, per- 
haps, because of the serious difficulties and discour- 
agements that came before success was secured. 
The importance of getting a good publisher inter- 
ested in a proposed work is strikingly illustrated by 
the fate of the first efforts of Mr. Schouler to get 
his history before the public. Information is given 
for the many who stumble over the spelling and 
pronunciation of the author's name, a Scotch rather 
than a German origin being shown, and "School-er " 
being indicated as the complete Americanization. 
This single volume of fugitive essays and magazine 
articles should have a place in every library where 
Mr. Schouler's history of the United States is valued 
as a very helpful and suggestive story of the seventy 
years between Washington and the Civil War. 



The literature 
of scoundrtlism. 



The curious book containing " The 
Lives of Twelve Eminent Scoun- 
drels," reviewed in our columns some 
months ago, has perhaps inspired the smaller volume 
of similar complexion by Mr. Charles Whibley, en- 
titled "A Book of Scoundrels " (Macmillan). Mr. 
Whibley writes with the air of a virtuoso in crime. 
He chronicles the deeds and sings the rascally perfec- 
tions of the heroes who march gallowsward over his 



Newgate-and-Tyburn-flavored pages with a feigned 
gusto that might pass for genuine were it not for an 
outcropping vein of Swiftean irony. The volume 
opens with a lengthy introductory touching scoun- 
drelism in general, its literature, its famous expo- 
nents, its crude and crass beginnings, its gradual rise 
to the dignity of a " liberal and an elegant profes- 
sion," its modern decline, and so on. These prole- 
gomena ended, the author proceeds to sketch rapidly 
and analytically the careers of such brilliant heroes 
of the " road," the " jimmy," and, alas, the death- 
trap, as Captain Hind, Jonathan Wild, Gilderoy, 
" Sixteen-String Jack," Shepard, Cartouche, George 
Barrington (prince of pickpockets and enricher of 
the Dictionary of Quotations with that deathless line, 
"We left our country for our country's good "), Dea- 
con Brodie, Charles Peace, etc. Mr. Whibley writes 
agreeably and with a touch of saturnine humor that 
somewhat relieves his ugly theme. The frontispiece 
is a portrait of Jack Shepard, from an old print, 
representing that worthy in his cell in Newgate, 
shackled with a chain that might moor the Great 
Eastern, and plainly engaged, not in moralizing as to 
how he got in, but in planning how to get out 
which he did in the end, miraculously forcing his 
way through a nine foot wall and other like obsta- 
cles with an address that procured him the notice 
of the King, immortality at the hands of Hogarth, 
and the more doubtful favor of a three-hundred- 
pound chain on his next incarceration. 



Studies in 



The seventh volume of "Harvard

dedicated, in a graceful Latin pref- 
ace, to Professor George Martin Lane, in commem- 
oration of what the Germans would call his jubilee 
the completion, that is, of the fiftieth year since 
he received his degree in arts from the institution 
in which he has so long and successfully taught. 
The papers are all contributed by pupils or col- 
leagues of Professor Lane. They are of a severely 
technical character, with the exception perhaps of 
Professor Louis Dyer's enthusiastic vindication of 
the plot of the "Agamemnon " against the strictures 
of the ingenious Mr. Verrall. Among the most 
noteworthy of these studies may be mentioned the 
syntactical papers of Professors Goodwin and Green- 
ough ; Professor Allen's argument that os colum- 
natum in Plautus refers to some kind of stocks ; 
Congressman William Everett's notes on Lucretius; 
and Professor Bale's " Syllabification in Roman 
Speech." 

Mr. Raskin never wrote words that 

r** "t ghty, "* no apology 
can be needed for the publication, in 
a new edition, of his " Letters to the Clergy " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), a little book long out of print. These 
" Letters " were written in 1879, at the request of 
the Rev. F. A. Malleson, and were intended to be 
read and discussed at the meetings of a small Cler- 
ical Society of which Mr. Malleson was secretary.

They were published, with various notes and com- 
ments, in 1880 ; but the book soon became rare, and 
Mr. Malleson has now published a new edition, with 
curtailments in one direction and additions in an- 
other. The " Letters " deal with questions of church 
discipline and observance, and go to the root of the 
matter in the true Ruskinian way. They are very in- 
teresting, because entirely sincere; and the comments 
provoked by them, and in large part reprinted, are 
almost equally interesting. The editor shows him- 
self an unconscious humorist when, speaking of the 
first edition, he says : " Had I known how valuable 
these little pamphlets were destined to become, I 
should have had many more printed." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The " Student's Series of English Classics," published 
by Messrs. Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn, now includes 
something like half a hundred numbers, uniform in 
style, and carefully edited by some of the best American 
scholars. The newest issues are " As You Like It," 
edited by Miss Katharine Lee Bates; "The Vicar of 
Wakefield," edited by Mr. James G. Riggs; Lowell's 
" Sir Launfal " and other poems, edited by Miss Mabel 
C. Willard; DeQuncey's " Revolt of the Tartars," edited 
by Mr. F. T. Baker; Carlyle's essay on Burns, edited by 
Mr. W. K. Wickes; and Dry den's " Palamonand Arcite," 
edited by Mr. W. F. Gregory. 

Recent German texts for school use include the fol- 
lowing: Goethe's " Dichtung und Wahrheit " (selec- 
tions), edited by Professor H. C. G. von Jagemann 
(Holt) ; Goethe's " Ipigenie auf Tauris," edited by 
Dr. C. A. Buchheim (Macmillan) ; a second volume of 
" Marchen und Erzahlungen fur Anfanger," by Miss 
H. A. Guerber (Heath) ; " Der Schwiegersohn," by 
Herr Rudolph Baumbacb, edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bern- 
hardt (Heath) ; " Plautus und Terenz " and " Die Sonn- 
tagsjager," two Comedies of Bendix, edited by Dr. 
B. W. Wells (Heath) ; and a little pamphlet of " Ma- 
terials for German Composition," based on Storm's 
" Immensee," by Professor James T. Hatfield (Heath). 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers of an 
" Elementary Algebra " and a " Euclidean Geometry," 
both the work of Mr. J. A. Gillet. The former book 
is in the main " elementary," as its title indicates, but 
the latter chapters cover the most advanced college 
requirements. The " Geometry " is styled " Euclidean " 
because it " maintains sharply the distinction between 
the processes of pure geometry on the one hand and 
those of arithmetic and algebra on the other." Both 
books are mechanically attractive. Messrs. Silver, Bur- 
dett, & Co. publish a " Plane Geometry," by Mr. G. D. 
Pettee, the aim of which is " to furnish if possible to the 
student a more suggestive method of study and a more 
graphic form of written demonstration." 

Five new volumes of " Longmans' English Classics " 
have just been published. The texts included are the 
following: " Edmund Burke's Speech on Conciliation 
with America," edited by Professor Albert S. Cook; 
Scott's " Marmion," edited by Mr. Robert Morss Lov- 
ett; DeQuincey's "Revolt of the Tartars," edited by 
Dr. Charles Sears Baldwin; Carlyle's essay on Burns, 
edited by Mr. Wilson Farrand; and a selection from 



Pope's " Iliad," edited by Messrs. W. H. Maxwell and 
Percival Chubb. These books carry the series well 
along into the requirements prescribed for 1898 and 
1899. We have only praise for the way in which the 
work has been done. 

" Life in Ponds and Streams " (Longmans), by Mr. 
W. S. Furneaux, is an attractive volume, adapted to the 
instruction of the amateur collector and naturalist. It 
is copiously illustrated with woodcuts and a series of 
colored plates, both admirably drawn. The instructions 
for collecting, mounting, and preserving specimens, and 
for managing the aquarium, are applicable as well in 
one region as another, and will well repay study. In 
one respect the work, like other British publications for 
the naturalist, will be a disappointment to the American 
reader, as the illustrations are all of British species, 
rarely represented in the American fauna. 

The following are the latest text-books upon classical 
subjects received by us. " The First Greek Book " 
(Ginn), by Professor John Williams White; "Greek 
Rudiments" (Longmans), by Mr. John Burnet; "The 
Strong and Weak Inflection in Greek" (Ginn), by Mr. 
B. F. Harding; Book I. of Livy (Leach), edited by 
Professor John K. Lord; " Preparatory Latin Composi- 
tion " (Ginn), by Mr. F. P. Moulton and Mr. W. C. 
Collar; Book II. of Csesar's "Gallic War" (Hinds & 
Noble), edited by Mr. A. H. Allcroft and Mr. W. F. 
Masom; "The Story of the Romans," by Miss H. A. 
Guerber, and a " Handbook of Greek and Roman His- 
tory," by Mr. Georges Castegnier, the latter two pub- 
lished by the American Book Co. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a neat volume of 
" Stories and Legends from Washington Irving," illus- 
trated, and well adapted for school use. No less popular 
a writer than Mr. Frank R. Stockton has prepared for 
the American Book Co. a volume of " Stories of New 
Jersey " to be used as a school reader. We understand 
that other volumes, designed for use in other states, are 
in course of preparation by this house. 

Professor Hiram Corson's " Selections from Chaucer's 
Canterbury Tales " (Macmillan) provides a very com- 
plete and carefully-equipped handbook for students 
beginning to study " the morning-star of song." The 
needful historical and linguistic information is given in 
the general introduction, while the appended notes and 
vocabulary are all that could be desired by any teacher 
of literature not hopelessly given over to worship of the 
false gods of philology. We wish, indeed, that the 
editor had pronounced somewhat more sharply in favor 
of an approximately correct pronunciation, but no other 
call for serious criticism seems to be heard. There are 
174 pages of text, carefully selected with reference ta 
interest and poetic quality. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish Erckmann- 
Chatrian's " Le Conscrit de 1813," edited by Mr. O. B. 
Super; M. Theuriet's " Bizarreau," edited by Mr. C. 
Fontaine; and a pamphlet of "Selections for Sight 
Translation" (from the French), compiled by Miss 
Mary S. Bruce. Other French texts are a " Petite His- 
toire de Napoleon le Grand " (Maynard), by Mr. A. H. 
Solial; Racine's "Iphige"nie" (American Book Co.), 
edited by Mr. B. D. Woodward ; and " La Lamp de 
Psyche* " (Jenkins), a pretty story by M. de Tinseau. 
Mr. Jenkins also publishes " An Elementary French, 
Grammar," by M. Charles P. Du Croquet. Finally, we 
may mention a volume of " Class-Room Conversations 
in French," by Messrs. V. Be*tis and Howard Swan, 
imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons.

LITERARY NOTES. 



An " Introduction to American Literature," by Pro- 
fessor Painter, is announced by Messrs. Leach, Shewell, 
& Sanborn. 

The Prophets of Israel," by Professor C. H. Cornill, 
is the latest number of " The Religion of Science 
Library," issued by the Open Court Publishing Co. 

The first part of the new year of the great English 
Dictionary of the Philological Society carries the D's 
from " disobstetricate " to " distrustful." Dr. Murray 
is the editor of this section. 

Under the capable direction of Mr. William A. 
Dresser, the Author's Agency of Boston has just en- 
tered upon its sixth year. The institution has won the 
endorsement of many well-known writers, who are in 
position to know something of its usefulness as a prac- 
tical medium between authors and publishers. 

The Messrs. Scribner announce a revised edition of 
Lanier's " The English Novel," a new volume, by Pro- 
fessor Burgess, in the "American History " series, the 
hitherto unpublished writings of Edward Gibbon, and 
the second volume of Professor Kent's " History of the 
Hebrew People." This house has also acquired from 
Messrs. Roberts Brothers the right to publish all of the 
novels of Mr. George Meredith. 

We regret to note that our Canadian contemporary, 
" The Week," has suspended publication. Although we 
have missed of late years something of the ability that 
characterized the paper in the days when Professor 
Goldwin Smith was actively associated with its editing, 
it has nevertheless been a welcome visitor, and has 
always given serious expression to the Canadian point 
of view in politics and other matters. 

The Macmillan Co. publish " Gulliver's Travels," 
edited by Mr. Israel Gollancz, in their charming " Tem- 
ple Classics," and announce for the same series Florio's 
Montaigne, in six volumes. They also publish the first 
volume of " A Harlot's Progress " (" Splendours et Mi- 
seres des Courtisanes "), translated by Mr. James War- 
ing, in their uniform edition of Balzac, and M. Daudet's 
" Sappho," translated by Mr. Henry Frith. 

Among the announcements of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons we note the following interesting titles: "A His- 
tory of Ancient Peoples," by Professor Willis Boughton ; 
" The Story of British Rule in India," by Mr. R. W. 
Frazer; " The Story of Modern France," by M. Andre* 
Le Bon; "The Literary History of the American Rev- 
olution," by Professor Moses Coit Tyler; " The Literary 
Movement in France in the 19th Century," by M. 
Georges Pellissier; the concluding volume of "Social 
England," edited by Mr. H. D. Traill; and the second 
part of Professor C. M. Andrews's " Historical Develop- 
ment of Modern Europe." 

Those poetry-lovers who are wont to lament the de- 
cadence of current magazine verse must have rubbed 
their eyes in pleased surprise on opening the pages of 
"Harper's Magazine" for January; and the surprise 
doubtless deepened as they read and re-read the beau- 
tiful poem on " Time," by Mr. Williston Fish. The com- 
position is so unmodern in thought and treatment, so 
quiet and restrained in utterance, so rich and quaint in 
expression, and of such finish and completeness, that it 
seems to belong to the master lyrists of the seventeenth 
century; indeed, it might almost be a companion-piece 
to Herbert's " Mortification," which its subject and 
treatment in a way suggest.

Charles Scribner's Sons' New Books 



TWO notable books from the pen of Mr. Barrie were published during the fall, each of them unique in qual- 
ity and character. The first of these, " SENTIMENTAL TOMMY " (Fourth Edition, 12mo, illustrated, 
$1.50), was the success of the year during its serial publication, and its immediate success in book form con- 
firms the judgment of its first readers that it is one of the genuine masterpieces of modern fiction. The other 
book, "MARGARET OQILVY" (Third Edition, 12mo, $1.25), possesses an equal interest, though of an 
altogether different kind. It is an affectionate and exquisitely delicate sketch of Mr. Barrie's mother, which 
is necessarily also a sketch of his own life and surroundings as well as his work; in its manner a sort of true 
" Window in Thrums." 

The British Weekly says of " Margaret Ogilvy ": "A book which it is almost sacrilegious to criticise. Yet just because it is inaccessible 
to ordinary comment, it is easy to place the volume, as it stands unmatched in literature as an idyl of the divinest of human feelings a 
mother's love. This is Mr. Barrie's finest and noblest book." 

AN ESSAY ON COMEDY 

And the Uses of the Comic Spirit. By GEORGE MEREDITH. 12mo, $1.25. 

The reader cannot fail to get a new and nearer view of the world's literature through the aid of this brilliant, incisive, 
broadening, and bracing book. Its treatment blends theory and illustration with successful clearness, and the different 
character the comic spirit assumes in Aristophanes, Menander, Shakespeare, Molie're, and Congreve is vividly depicted. 

THE NOVELS OF GEORGE MEREDITH. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have acquired from Messrs. Roberts Brothers the right to publish the novels of Mr. 
Meredith heretofore published by them. These, together with " The Amazing Marriage " and " Lord Ormont and his 
Aminta," comprise all of Mr. Meredith's novels. They will be sold as heretofore : 14 volumes, 12mo edition, per vol., $1.50 ; 
popular edition, per vol., $1.00. 

LIMITED ENGLISH EDITION. The only uniform and complete edition of Mr. Meredith's works is now being issued in 32 volumes, 
Svo. The edition limited to 1000 stts, and similar in style to the Edinburgh Edition of R. L. Stevenson's works. Full information concerning 
the edition will be sent on application. 

THE MIDDLE PERIOD. 

By JOHN W. BURGESS, Professor of History, Columbia University. (American History Series.) 

12mo, $1.75. 

A thoroughly original work written exclusively from the sources. The view the author takes of the great slavery 
controversy, of which it is the chronicle and commentary, distinguishes it among histories of the period for absolute impar- 
tiality and luminous appreciation of the motives and conduct of both sides.

HOW TO LISTEN TO MUSIC. 

Hints and Suggestions to Untaught Lovers of the Art. By HENRY E. KREHBIEL. 
Illustrated, 12mo, $1.25 net. 

" This book, by the well-known critic, Mr. H. B. Krehbiel, might justly be called the music-lover's enchiridion. There is scarcely an 
amateur who will not get more profit as well as pleasure from orchestral concerts after having read it. It not only evinces knowledge of a 
high order on the part of the author, but the still rarer quality of knowing just how to adopt technical learning to the average non-professional 
mind." The Outlook. 



NANCY NOON. 

By BENJAMIN SWIFT. 12mo, $1.50. 

" One of the strongest books of the season a great rough diamond, 
so brilliant that it does not need the skill of the cutter. The author 
has creative power aijd genius. He is original and daring. He has 
treated emotional life with Kipling virility. " Boston Herald.

of "Amos Judd." Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 

" Delightful examples of how short stories should be written. Mr.

" The author has given an outline of each story, pre-

a selection recounting some incident in the story. In 
this way are treated : the Ramayana, the Maha Bharata, 
the Iliad, Odyssey, Nibelungen Lied, Poem of the Cid, 
Orlando Furioso, Jerusalem Delivered, Paradise Lost 
and eight others seventeen in all, from twelve na-

SHAKESPEARE IN FRANCE. 

The learned M. Jusserand, who is as enter- 
taining as he is learned, and who has done 
almost as much as Taine did (although in a 
very different way) to give a new interest to 
the history of English literature, is now pub- 
lishing in the international review " Cosmopo- 
lis " a series of articles upon the fortunes of 
Shakespeare among the Frenchmen. The sub- 
ject of this investigation is so novel, as well as 
so interesting inherently, that it seems worth 
while to tell M. Jusserand's story in condensed 
form, pending its completion and full transla- 
tion into English. Of course, we all know in 
its general outline the history of Shakespearian 
study in France, but few even among students 
know the interesting details of the narrative 
which M. Jusserand is now illustrating from 
the wealth of his rich and curious reading, 
which he is adorning with his piquant style and 
warming with his sympathetic " appreciation " 
of the greatest poet of the modern world. 

M. Jusserand introduces his narrative by 
setting side by side two passages, published re- 
spectively in 1645 and 1765, and roughly indi- 
cating the limits of the period to which the 
chief interest of the story attaches, the period 
during which Shakespeare won his way to the 
French consciousness. The first extract is from 
Blaeu's " Theatre du Monde," a sort of glori- 
fied gazeteer, and informs the reader that Strat- 
ford is a pleasant little town which owes its 
entire glory to "Jehan de Stratford, archeveque 
de Cantorbery" and "Hugues de Clopton, 
juge a Londres." One of these worthies, it 
seems, built a church in Stratford, and the 
other spanned the Avon with a bridge. To this 
writer, Shakespeare was less than a name ; Strat- 
ford had enough of glory in its claim upon the 
primate and the judge. The other extract is 
from the " Encyclopaedia," and speaks of Strat- 
ford in this fashion : "It was not long ago that 
the house in which Shakespeare (William) 
died in 1616 was still pointed out in this town ; 
it was even regarded as a curiosity of the coun- 
try and the inhabitants regretted its destruc- 
tion, so jealous are they of the glory of having 
given birth to this sublime genius, the greatest 
in all dramatic poetry." The article fills five

columns, and although its title is " Stratford," 
its exclusive subject is Shakespeare. To trace 
the history of the change in French opinion 
thus brought about by a century has been the 
task of M. Jusserand, and the subject is one 
richly deserving of attention. 

The first judgment upon Shakespeare to find 
expression in the French language occurs in a 
catalogue of the Royal Library (1675-1684). 
A copy of the second folio had found its way 
into the collection, and the entry of the cata- 
loguer included, besides a Latinized form of 
the title, the following note : " This English 
poet has a rather fine imagination, he thinks 
naturally, he expresses himself with delicacy, 
but these fine qualities are darkened by the 
filth that he mingles with his comedies." An 
inventory of Fouquet's library shows that it 
also contained a volume of Shakespeare " valued 
at one livre." The first printed mention of 
Shakespeare in France occurs in Baillet's 
"Jugements des Savants" (1685-6). Here 
the name is given, without comment, in a list 
of English poets. Two or three other fugitive 
allusions to a poet variously named " Shak- 
spear " and " Shakees Pear " may be found 
during the closing years of the reign of the 
Roi-Soleil, but the great age of French litera- 
ture was over, and Corneille, Racine, and Mo- 
liere had long been in their graves, before even 
a Frenchman here and there had so much as 
dreamed that the English poet who had died 
when Corneille was a boy of ten was destined 
to enjoy a heritage of fame so world-wide and so 
enduring that even the genius of Moliere would 
come to seem pale in the comparison. 

The first half of the eighteenth century 
changed all this. Not only did Shakespeare 
become widely known in France, through criti- 
cism and even through translation, but his 
plays began to influence the French stage, and 
to awaken an uneasy feeling that possibly the 
rules of the classic drama might not have said 
the final word upon the subject of dramatic 
composition. During the period in question a 
great many writers found occasion to speak of 
Shakespeare in appreciative terms, and some of 
these writers were men whose opinions carried 
much weight. The Abbe Prevost, who made 
a long stay in England, and began to publish 
his " Memoires " in 1728, became a genuine 
anglomaniac, the first in date of a numerous 
tribe. The beauty of Mrs. Oldfield inspired 
him to learn her language, and, having learned 
it, he read Shakespeare and waxed enthusiastic. 
" For beauty of sentiment," he says, " whether 



tender or sublime, for the tragic form which 
stirs the depths of the heart and infallibly 
arouses passion in the dullest souls, for energy 
of expression and for the art of contriving sit- 
uations and carrying on an action, I have read 
nothing, either in Greek or in French, which 
takes the palm from the English drama." 
Even Montesquieu felt compelled to have an 
opinion concerning Shakespeare, although, as 
M. Jusserand remarks, it does him less honor 
than his opinions upon government. In 1830, 
he had an audience with the queen, who began 
to talk about the drama. She asked Lord 
Chesterfield, who was also present, how it hap- 
pened that Shakespeare, who lived in the age 
of Elizabeth, had made his women speak so 
badly and act so foolishly. " Milord Chester- 
field answered the question very well by saying 
that women did not appear upon the stage, and 
that their parts were taken by poor actors, for 
which reason Shakespeare did not take any 
great pains to make them speak well. I should 
give the other reason that, to make women 
speak well, one must know the ways and the 
conventions of society. To make heroes speak, 
book knowledge is all that is necessary." These 
explanations, observes the commentator, " en- 
abled Queen Caroline (to whom Voltaire had 
just dedicated his ' Henriade ') to understand 
why Beatrice, Rosalind, Portia, and Juliet 
speak so badly and are so foolish." Meanwhile, 
Voltaire, who had the precious gift of writing 
with "blacker ink" than other men, and of com- 
pelling attention to whatever he might choose 
to say, had lived for three years in London, 
and published his " Lettres Philosophiques " 
in 1834. Henceforth, there was no escaping 
Shakespeare for the cultivated Frenchman, for 
Voltaire said things about him that could not 
possibly be ignored. His appreciation was 
qualified, but for that perhaps all the more 
forcible, and it is quite evident that he was 
more deeply impressed than he was willing to 
let appear. In the " Lettres " he said : " Shake- 
speare had a genius full of force and fertility, 
of what is natural and what is sublime, with 
not the least spark of good taste, and without 
the least knowledge of the rules." In the intro- 
duction to "Semiramis" (1748), where the 
famous epithet of the "drunken savage" oc- 
curs, he said that " Hamlet " contains " sub- 
lime strokes worthy of the loftiest geniuses. It 
seems as if nature had taken delight in collect- 
ing within the brain of Shakespeare all that 
we can imagine of what is greatest and most 
powerful, with all that rudeness without wit 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

can contain of what is lowest and most detest- 
able." Testimonies to Shakespeare were now 
rapidly multiplying. Riccoboni (1738) wrote 
a history of the English stage, saying of Shake- 
speare that " having used up his patrimony, he 
took up the trade of robber. He wrote san- 
guinary dramas, ' Hamlet ' among others, and 
* Othello,' in which we witness the incredible 
strangling of Desdemona." Le Blanc (1745) 
found fairly fitting words in which to express 
the magic of Shakespeare's style. Finally, La 
Place (1746) made a French translation of 
many of the plays, and prepared analyses of the 
others. 

In the latter half of the eighteenth century, 
we come face to face with the " Shakespeare 
question," which fills the last and most inter- 
esting chapter in all this curious history. Speak- 
ing of the translation of " Tom Jones " made 
in 1750, d'Argenson remarked : " Anglicism 
is gaining upon us," while Boissy, in a comedy 
dated 1753, made sport of the fickle tastes of 
the French public, which sought after strange 
gods, now in Italy, now in England. 

"Son transport 1'autre jour e'tait 1'anglomanie ; 
Rien sans 1'habit anglais ne pouvait rdussir ; 
Au-dessus de Cornell] e il mettait Shakespir." 

Something clearly had to be done, and Vol- 
taire, who felt that both his critical precept and 
his practice as a dramatic poet had been largely 
responsible for this exaltation of the " sauvage 
ivre," stepped into the breach. It was all very 
well to praise Shakespeare in measured terms, 
as he had himself done, but when it came to a 
complete and sumptuous translation, dedicated 
to the king, and prefaced by the judgment that 
" never had man of genius penetrated deeper 
into the abyss of the human heart or given 
better and more natural speech to the pas- 
sions," it was really going too far. " Had not 
he [Voltaire] granted enough to the monster ? 
Had not he introduced certain liberties to the 
French stage ? Had not he cleared, and pruned, 
and given regular shape to this lofty thicket ? " 
But now there was nothing less in question than 
a revolution of taste. Even Diderot was call- 
ing Shakespeare " a Gothic colossus between 
whose legs we might all pass?" "All? ex- 
claimed Voltaire, and his indignation waxed." 
Nothing less than a formal protest to the Acad- 
emy could suffice for such a critical situation. 
" There are not in France enough buffets, 
enough foolscaps, enough pillories for such a 
fellow " as the audacious Le Tourneur, who 
was responsible for the translation that was so 
heralded. " The frightful thing about it is that 



the monster has a party in France, and to cap 
the climax of calamity, it was I who formerly 
first spoke of this Shakespeare, it was I who 
first showed the French a few pearls that I had 
found in his enormous manure-heap." Thus 
wrote the recluse of Ferney to a friend, and in 
this spirit was prepared his communication to 
the Academy. The protest was read at the 
session of August 25, 1776, and its success for 
the hour, at least, was complete. A year or 
two later, and only a few weeks before his 
death, Voltaire inscribed his last tragedy to 
the Academy, and took occasion to renew the 
attack. The letter ended with these words : 
" Shakespeare is a savage with sparks of genius 
that shine in a horrible night." Thus closes 
this interesting and characteristic episode in 
Voltaire's life, and with it what is most signif- 
icant about the history of the fortunes of Shake- 
speare in France under the old regime. 



FENIMORE COOPER AND MARK 
TWAIN. 

When " The North American Review " of July, 
1895, printed a laughable sally against Fenimore 
Cooper by our quaint and popular Mark Twain, the 
public was once more left in doubt as to where humor 
ended and soberness began. In the first sentence of 
the article, three of Cooper's admirers, who hap- 
pened to be at the same time distinguished in the 
study or the practice of literature in Europe and 
America, were charged with not having read his 
writings before pronouncing judgment. This was 
evidently a joke, and everybody smiled. Later, 
Mark proposed to call the " Leather Stocking Tales " 
the " Broken Twig Series," and everybody smiled 
again. So when, to suit his effect, our humorist 
guessed Cooper's canal-boat to be of so great defi- 
nite dimensions, and his river precisely of so little 
breadth, as to present an amusing contrast; and, 
further, when he expanded two short sentences of 
Cooper's narrative into two-thirds of a page of 
graphic imaginative description of some very foolish 
jumping Indians, the smile grew into that species of 
applause which only a humorist can awaken. But, 
while this tone of extravagant raillery ran through 
the article, the impression left by it as a whole was 
that the author really believed Cooper guilty of 
serious literary offences. 

In Professor Brander Matthews's Introduction to 
a recent reprint of the " Leather Stocking Tales," 
Mark Twain's article is mentioned ; but while it is 
pronounced unappreciative in one direction and an 
over-statement in another, there is no attempt to 
examine it in detail. It may not be out of place in 
the interest of a just estimate of Cooper himself, nor 
untimely in view of the revival of interest indicated

THE DIAL, 



[Feb. 16, 



by the appearance of two new editions of his works * 
to pass in review some of the points made against 
him by Mr. Clemens, disentangling, so far as possi- 
ble, the cluster of fact from the tendrils of fun. 

One charge that seems to be urged by Mark with 
an accent of seriousness behind the extravagance 
of its form is that Cooper's novels " fail to accom- 
plish something and arrive somewhere." This seems 
to mean that they lack unity of purpose and con- 
structive ability. But " The Deerslayer," which is 
selected for the most abundant ridicule, is clearly 
the account of a mission undertaken by the hero 
and his Indian friend in behalf of the latter. In 
carrying out this mission the fortunes of Deerslayer 
are united with those of another group of characters, 
and after the mission is accomplished, the book ends 
when the hero is released from peril of his life 
incurred as a consequence of this piece of unselfish 
devotion. Surely there is a tolerable adherence to 
the accomplishment of a definite object in this story, 
to say nothing now of others. The object is, it is 
true, as usual, connected with a practical end, involv- 
ing a series of adventures, and thus as far as possi- 
ble removed from the thought-analysis of the modern 
school. But here, as in general, the story " accom- 
plishes something," under a somewhat orderly de- 
velopment. 

Concerning Cooper's characters, it is asserted that 
they are ill-defined, are not alive, do not converse 
like real people nor at all times in the same diction. 
It may be freely admitted that in character-drawing 
the author does not display his richest talent, yet 
the dominating figure of these five tales rises to 
declare, in unison with Lowell in his " Fable for 
Critics," that at least one new figure, likely to re- 
main, has been added to the gallery of fiction. The 
simple uprightness of Leather Stocking, his peace- 
loving disposition in the midst of war, his natural 
religion, his respect for the " gifts " of other men, 
his bravery, coolness, and skill, all these, what- 
ever exceptions may justly be taken, unite to form 
a man, who is confessedly the creation of romance, 
yet whose life is more real to thousands than is 
many an historic character, and whose noble death- 
note may well have suggested to Thackeray, as the 
Introduction hints, the famous "Adsum ! " of Colonel 
Newcome. Nor are touches lacking in the minor 
characters to attest the author's adherence to the 
broad lines of nature. Is it true, by the way, that a 
speaker uses, whatever his mood, the same sort of 
language ? Is it not rather true that poetic or other 
emotion causes a heightening of one's style, produc- 
ing what may be called native eloquence ? If it is not 
true, let the printer substitute a few apostrophes for 
the vowels in some of Deerslayer's more poetic 
speeches, and the fault will be obviated. But let us 
not deny to him the capacity for poetic exaltation. 

* " Leather Stocking Tales " in 5 vols., with introduction by 
Brander Matthews and illustrations by F. T. Merrill, pub- 
lished by Messrs. Crowell & Co.; " Mohawk Edition " of Com- 
plete Works in 32 vols., with new illustrations, published by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



Further, says our humorist-critic, the events of 
Cooper's tales are not probable, nay, they are not 
possible ; they are miraculous, and that too without 
even any successful attempt to render them plausi- 
ble. This judgment, if seriously meant, is extreme. 
Of course Cooper was not writing realism, for real- 
ism was not yet invented. But he usually recog- 
nizes the improbable character of an event, when it 
is improbable, and tries to render it credible. Thus 
a foot-note in " The Pathfinder " explains that the 
writer has known a thirty-two pound boat to be 
carried over the falls of the Oswego, as described, in 
perfect safety. Mr. Clemens finds food for laughter 
in an Indian's turning a running stream out of its 
course and finding traces of a foot-print in its allu- 
vial bed. But Cooper is careful to describe the 
stream as a " turbid little rill." If the phenomenon 
could occur under any circumstances, it were pos- 
sible under these. Again, the saving of a vessel by 
relying upon the under-tow, near the shore of On- 
tario, to aid the anchors in overcoming the drift, is 
jeered at by Mark as the height of impossibility. 
Cooper makes a conceited old sea-captain, unaccus- 
tomed to our inland lakes, play the part that Mark 
plays in his criticism : . 

"'Under-tow!' . . . 'who the devil ever heard of 
saving a vessel from going ashore by the under-tow! ' " 

" ' This may never happen on the ocean, sir,' Jasper 
answered, modestly, ' but we have known it to happen 
here.' " 

This is Cooper's reply, and shows at least that the 
writer prepared the way for his " miracle." 

Is it not presumptuous for a critic to find fault 
with the description of places which the author has 
known from boyhood, but which the critic himself 
presumably never visited ? An example of this fal- 
lacy is in Mark's comments upon Cooper's picture of 
Otsego Lake and the Susquehanna flowing from it. 
By jocular comparison of some of Cooper's figures 
concerning the breadth of the river in different 
places, a humorous effect of stupid incongruity is 
produced. As it happens, Mr. C. A. Perry, of Coop- 
erstown, who has frequently fished upon the lake 
and river in question, declares that, with due allow- 
ance for the shelving shores of the lake, and for the 
trees and bushes lining the banks of the river, of 
both of which Cooper himself makes special men- 
tion, there is no necessary absurdity or contradiction 
in the details as given of the scene. The author 
was not furnishing a surveyor's plan of the grounds ; 
he was only writing a story, laid, however, in scenes 
with which he was completely familiar. Suppose 
we apply this same sort of arithmetical blindness 
to Mark himself. In describing the way in which 
a real cannon-ball acts, in contrast with one de- 
scribed by Cooper, the critic says it " skips a hun- 
dred feet or so ; skips again a hundred feet or so 
and so on." We suspect that an outcry would be 
raised if an arithmetician should assume that, be- 
cause exactly the same language is used in each 
case, the writer means that the second ricochet of 
the ball was equal to the first.

THE DIAL

Mr. Clemens has much to say about Cooper's En- 
glish. He gives a number of examples of misused 
words, alleged to have been drawn from half a 
dozen pages of " The Deerslayer." Unfortunately 
the lack of references renders the reader unable to 
examine the context of these words, and thus, in 
some cases, leaves him undecided whether Cooper or 
Mr. Clemens is correct. Still, there is little doubt that 
Cooper suffered under a mild form of linguistic astig- 
matism. His constant use of " individual " for " per- 
son," not mentioned by Mr. Clemens, may be taken 
as an example of his imperfect command of words. 
But to say this alone to characterize his style as 
at times slovenly, as does Professor Matthews is 
to leave the false impression of an incomplete state- 
ment. Cooper's style is that of a writer whose first 
love is the blue sky, the woods, the calm or stormy 
waters, and who tells his story in the hasty conver- 
sational unbookish manner of an out-of-door man. 
To expect from him academic nicety, or such accu- 
racy as comes from studying to-day's rhetorical 
treatise, is to look for what he does not try to give. 
When the editor changes Cooper's " none were " to 
" none was," he is guided by what may fairly be 
called academic standards. As to the frequent use 
of " female " for " woman," the former term was evi- 
dently regarded as " genteel " when Cooper began to 
write. Turn in proof to " The Lady of the Manor," 
by Mrs. Sherwood, printed in 1828, and you shall 
read upon the title-page that the book was " in- 
tended for the middle and higher ranks of Young 
Females." If Cooper's English, then, is sometimes 
inaccurate, it is with the inaccuracy of contempo- 
rary usage, while its ease and freedom are in them- 
selves better than the cramped mannerism of cer- 
tain bookmen. 

The question whether Cooper's novels are or are 
not interesting, to which of course Mr. Clemens 
makes unfavorable answer, is dependent after all 
upon the personal equation, as Professor Matthews 
says. Cooper will have to content himself, in this 
regard, with the hundreds of thousands of delighted 
readers he has already had in his own land and 
across the sea, and with the hundreds of thousands 
more he is likely to have as the result of such re- 
prints as have lately been given to the public. 

In taking leave of Mark Twain, it seems just to 
say, in view of the facts, that, considered as scien- 
tific criticism, his diatribe needs at least as much 
kindly allowance as do Cooper's " Leather Stocking 
Tales " tried by modern standards of the novel. 
For, although Cooper did not in any sense forestall 
the latest phase of fiction, his work has intrinsic 
merits upon which it may securely rely. Perhaps 
its most obvious quality is the out-door atmosphere 
pervading every book. The author had a lively 
feeling for nature, in its broad aspects, and, while 
his pages do not, like Miss Murfree's, contain long 
poetic descriptions of rock and sky, there blows 
through them the breath of the free air, the glorious 
sun shines above, the shadowing leaves of the forest 
rustle overhead. This uncrowded earth is fitting 



theatre for the man of action, too absorbed in doing 
to devote his hours to reflection, yet possessing 
somehow thoughts of duty and of God. And when 
the woodsman must shoot the rapids, or track the 
footsteps of his enemy, or endure savage torture, he 
approaches such experience with the strong and 
poised frame of one for whom bodily hazard holds 
an everlasting charm. 

Another trait of Cooper's, that should secure him 
the lasting regard of his countrymen, is the essen- 
tially American quality of these tales. In a general 
view, one is struck by the occurrence of situations 
among the characters that could not pass in other 
countries without remark. The women of these tales 
are under the gallant protection of the men, whose 
purity and chivalry are relied upon with an unques- 
tioning faith. It is only in an American novel that 
such chastity is taken for granted. In a specific 
sense, Cooper has done for New York what no his- 
torian or map-maker has accomplished : he has left 
a vivid record of that ample domain, in the days 
preceding the Revolution, when the Indian was in 
some active degree a competitor with the white man 
for occupancy of the soil. Where else shall we go 
for such vital pictures of the essential truth of these 
otherwise obliterated days? 

Tried by the standards of fiction, by permanent 
standards, so far as one may arrogate possession of 
these, Cooper speaks his power in that he has had 
a host of imitators. Inevitably the imitation is far 
inferior to the original : the dime-novel is a syn- 
onym of the plague. But to be the father of a 
numerous race is something, though the children mul- 
tiply the vices of the parent and forget his virtues. 
For Cooper is throughout as wholesome as a forest 
breeze, or a dip into the lake : no reader will draw 
from him one casuistic precept, or one admired ex- 
ample of lust or cruelty. In his own words : " The 
preference [the author] gives to the high qualities 
named, over beauty, delirious passion, and sin, it is 
hoped, will offer a lesson that can injure none." It is 
true that he poetized the Indian and the backwoods- 
man. Herein lies his limitation, as it is also his glory. 
To judge him by the newly-set-up criterion of real- 
ism is something like measuring flowers with a yard- 
stick. Mr. Bliss Carman has said : " Realism has 
given us a careful and studious manner in art, which 
renders it delightful to the quiet and curious reader ; 
but for the incurious and active man it is somewhat 
lacking in interest." Cooper, shall we say, has 
written for the incurious and active man, or for any 
man in his adventurous and unscientific moods. 
Without decrying realism, therefore, we shall do 
well to encourage a catholic taste, explaining the 
American romance of adventure by the circum- 
stances out of which it was born, and welcoming it 
as capable still of affording entertainment and re- 
freshment when a redundancy of over-nice distinc- 
tions and of proved though insignificant data brings 
a longing for the excitement of a free shot in the 
open air and a grapple with the stealthy foe.

THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES IN NEW 
FRANCE.* 



No similar undertaking with which we are 
acquainted reflects more credit upon Western 
scholarship and publishing enterprise than the 
present undertaking by the scholars and pub- 
lishers who have the matter in charge, to bring 
out, in the form that they have determined 
upon, " The Jesuit Relations and Allied Docu- 
ments." This is stating the case moderately ; 
we had almost said American scholarship and 
publishing enterprise. The title-page, which is 
transcribed in full below, describes the under- 
taking in a general way, but it does not convey, 
save to a few specialists, its full significance. 
More definitely, the undertaking embraces the 
following things : First, the discovery and 
identification, in many different places as 
libraries and collections, public and private, 
some in the old world and some in the new 
of more than one hundred and fifty titles of 
French, Latin, and Italian texts, most of them 
dating from the seventeenth century, which are 
together sufficient, with the translations and 
explanatory matter, to fill sixty octavo volumes 
of 300 pages each ; secondly, the transcription 
of these texts, some of them in a very imper- 
fect condition, and the collation of varying 
copies ; thirdly, the translation into current 
English of these texts, which, for the most part, 
are written in a language and a style now out- 
grown ; fourthly, the preparation of the exten- 
sive explanatory apparatus introduction, pre- 
faces, and notes that is needed to make the 
documents fully intelligible to readers ; fifthly, 
the carrying through the press of this vast mass 
of material texts, translations, and comment- 
ary in the highly creditable manner that 
marks the three volumes that have already ap- 
peared ; and sixthly, the management of the 
undertaking as a piece of business in such a way 
as to make it commercially successful. The 
work already done is sufficient proof that the 
five points will all be met, not only satisfac- 
torily but admirably ; and we hope most sin-

cerely that equal success will crown the enter- 
prise in the sixth and last particular. 

The documents named in the title are not so 
familiar to the reading public, or even their 
general name, as to render a brief description 
of them superfluous. 

When the extensive countries that constituted 
New France fell to France under the right of 
discovery, they were, so long at least as France 
should hold them, devoted to the Catholic faith. 
It is true that the first attempts at French 
colonization in Acadia, as well as in Carolina 
and in Florida, were made under Huguenot 
leadership ; but under the conditions existing 
in France all such attempts were foredoomed 
to failure. Even the charter given by Henry 
IV. to DeMonts, which conceded Calvinistic 
pastors to Calvinistic colonists, stipulated that 
only the Catholic faith should be taught to the 
Indians. Granted the determined effort to con- 
vert the savages of New France to the Catholic 
faith, it is hardly too much to say that the 
Jesuits were the predestined cultivators of the 
field. They were not indeed the first Catholic 
missionaries on the ground ; but the character 
of the work to be done, and their admirable 
fitness for it, together with the strength of the 
order, not to speak of the political power that 
was at first behind them, sufficed to enable 
them to distance all competitors as bearers of 
the cross to the red men. 

The black robes are first met with in the 
persons of Fathers Biard and Masse, at Port 
Royal, in June, 1611 ; on the St. Lawrence 
they do not appear until 1625. But neither of 
these dates marks the beginning of the Jesuit 
missions, properly so called. In 1628-29 the 
French settlements in New France fell into 
English hands. If they had been retained, as 
it certainly seems they might have been had not 
Charles First's interest in the half of the dower 
of Queen Henrietta which had been withheld 
been greater than in half a continent, American 
history, in many important respects, would have 
been something very different from what the his- 
torians have written. New France was returned 
to France in 1632, at the peace, for 400,000 
crowns. Now the spiritual interests of both set- 
tlers and savages were, by the highest authority, 
entrusted to the Jesuits ; and with the arrival 
of three of the Fathers at Quebec in July, 1632, 
the Jesuit missions proper in North America 
begin. From first to last these missions, fol- 
lowing Mr. Thwaites's grouping, were the fol- 
lowing : The Abenaki Mission, in Maine and 
Acadia and on Cape Breton Island ; the Mon-

tagnis Mission, centred at Tadoussac, at the 
junction of the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay 
Rivers ; the Quebec and Montreal Mission, 
which is sufficiently described by its name ; the 
Huron Mission, planted in the region south of 
Georgian Bay ; the Iroquois Mission to the 
Iroquois of Central New York and the St. Law- 
rence ; the Ottawa Mission, embracing the 
numerous tribes and fragments of tribes found 
in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and adja- 
cent parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota ; the 
Louisiana Mission, which included the Illinois 
country as well as the region of the Lower 
Mississippi. 

Mr. Thwaites controverts Mr. Bancroft's 
statement in regard to discovery and explora- 
tion, when he says : " Not a cape was turned, 
not a river entered, but a priest led the way." 
" The actual pioneers of New France," on the 
other hand, " were almost always coureurs de 
bois, in the prosecution of the fur trade ; but 
coureurs de bois, for obvious reasons, seldom 
kept records, even when capable of doing so, and 
as a rule we learn of their previous appearance 
on the scene only through chance allusions in the 
' Relations.' " The Jesuits performed a great 
service to mankind in publishing their annals, 
which are, for historian, geographer, and eth- 
nologist, among our first and best authorities. 

Perhaps no literary documents were ever 
written under circumstances more uncomfort- 
able and discouraging, cold, heat, hunger, 
danger, insects, weariness, dirt, and smoke, be- 
sides the human society that surrounded their 
authors. But the " Relations " are not the 
annals of the missionaries in just the form in 
which they were written ; for they were edited, 
first in Canada and then in Paris, before their 
publication. How the documents in their pres- 
ent form were elaborated from the whole mass 
of written material, the editor of the series well 
explains in the following paragraph : 

"A few explorers like Champlain, Radisson, and Per- 
rot have left valuable narratives behind them, which are 
of prime importance in the study of the beginnings of 
French settlement in America; but it is to the Jesuits 
that we owe the great body of our information concern- 
ing the frontiers of New France in the seventeenth cen- 
tury. It was their duty annually to transmit to their 
superior in Quebec or Montreal a written journal of 
their doings; it was also their duty to pay occasional 
visits to their superior, and to go into retreat at the 
central house of the Canadian mission. Annually, be- 
tween 1632 and 1673, the superior made up a narrative 
or ' Relation ' of the most important events which had 
occurred in the several missionary districts under his 
charge, sometimes using the exact words of the mission- 
aries, and sometimes with considerable editorial skill 
summarizing the individual journals in a general ac- 



count, based in part upon the oral reports of visiting 
fathers. This annual Relation,' which in bibliographies 
occasionally bears the name of the superior, and at other 
times that of the missionary chiefly contributing to it, 
was forwarded to the provincial of the order in France, 
and, after careful scrutiny and reediting, published by 
him in a series of duodecimo volumes, known collect- 
ively as ' The Jesuit Relations.' " 

The "Allied Documents " are similar to the 
" Relations " in this, that they introduce or con- 
tinue the main story or throw additional light 
upon it. They are not all the work of Jesuits. 
Some of them are excluded from the category 
" Relation " more on technical grounds than 
any other. Properly speaking, the " Rela- 
tions " begin in 1632, when the Jesuits returned 
to Canada, and close with 1673, when Fron- 
tenac, it is conjectured, procured the discontin- 
uance of their publication. At the same time r 
the list of titles to appear in this series extend 
all the way from 1611 to 1791. It should be 
added that after 1700 they are relatively sparse 
only some twenty titles in all. The occur- 
rence of the word in a title does not necessarily 
constitute the document a " Relation." 

Until half a century ago, little was known of 
the " Relations " outside of Jesuit circles ; and 
to Dr. E. B. O'Callaghan, editor of " The Doc- 
umentary History of New York," is given the 
credit of having effectually called the attention 
of scholars to their great value as historical ma- 
terial. Since then they have been held in con- 
stantly growing estimation ; and their publica- 
tion in the present form cannot fail to make 
them more fully known, more widely studied, 
and more highly valued, than heretofore. Here 
they are, the originals and the translations, side 
by side, on opposite pages, for everybody to read 
and examine who cares to essay the task. 

These documents will be resorted to by dif- 
ferent persons for very different ends. Here is 
material in rich abundance for the geographer, 
the student of natural history, the ethnologist, 
the philologist, the anthropologist, the investi- 
gator of primitive culture, the historian of mis- 
sionary effort, and the historian of the long 
struggle between England and France in North 
America. It would be hard to say which one 
of several kinds of inquirers will find most to 
reward his search. Upon the value of the 
" Relations and Allied Documents " to the stu- 
dent of American history, it can hardly be 
necessary to enlarge. At the same time that 
the English people were planting colonies on 
the Atlantic coast from Maine to Georgia, the 
French were planting competing colonies in 
Acadia, Cape Breton, the Valley of the St. 



112

Lawrence, the Basin of the Great Lakes, and 
the Valley of the Mississippi ; and the sources 
of the history of these two groups of colonies 
are intertwined, just like the sources of the 
streams flowing to the Atlantic Ocean and to 
the interior waters, from the mouth of the St. 
Lawrence to the mouth of the Mississippi. As 
well might the geographer studying the Atlantic 
slope disregard the slopes that begin just be- 
yond its crown, or vice versa, as the historian of 
the English colonial development to use English 
sources alone or the historian of the French de- 
velopment to use French sources alone. 

As a record of missionary enterprise, the 
" Relations " are at once very inspiring and 
very depressing. We do not know that a com- 
plete list of the Jesuits employed in the seven 
missions first and last exists or could even be 
made up ; but, if so, we feel confident that it 
would be difficult or impossible to make up an 
equal list of men from any age or period of the 
history of the world, not even from the mar- 
tyr age of the Church, who have shown greater 
courage, fortitude, devotion, and zeal in the 
prosecution of any great and inspiring cause. 
Nor can it be said that the Jesuits had zeal 
without knowledge ; perhaps no men were ever 
better fitted to undertake such a task than they 
were. From their story men may draw exam- 
ples of moral heroism for all time. And to 
what end was this sublime effort made ? To 
none whatever, as the event proved ; one and 
all, the missions were complete failures. And 
why ? There is some truth in the conjectural 
answer that the missions might have succeeded 
had it not been for the inplacable enmity of 
the Iroquois, or in the answer that their failure 
was only a part of the failure of New France, 
which, after a century and a half of rather 
feeble life, passed into the hands of a Protes- 
tant power ; but the profounder student will not 
fail to take a much deeper view than either of 
these. He will see that the failure was prima- 
rily due to the total inability of the savages to 
receive Christian ideas, or to live anything de- 
serving to be called a Christian life. Indeed, 
such success as the Jesuits seemed to have re- 
sulted from their practically putting the new 
faith on the savage level making it a matter 
of rites, ordinances, and sacraments, the ideal 
significance of which the Indians did not and 
could not discern. The " Relations " are an 
eloquent confirmation of the words of a distin- 
guished English scholar : " The truth which 
Aristotle enunciated, that all intellectual teach- 
ing is based upon what is primarily known to the 



person taught, is applicable to a race as well as 
to an individual, and to beliefs even more than 
to knowledge." And yet we recall the contrast 
between the converts of the Jesuits in Canada 
and the converts of the Moravians in Pennsyl- 
vania and Ohio as sketched by Mr. Parkman. 
"The Moravians were apostles of peace, and they 
succeeded to a surprising degree in weaning their con- 
verts from their ferocious instincts and warlike habits; 
while the Mission Indians of Canada retained all their 
native fierceness, and were systematically impelled to 
use their tomahawks against the enemies of the Church. 
Their wigwams were hung with scalps, male and female, 
adult and infant ; and these so-called missions were but 
nests of baptised savages, who wore the crucifix instead 
of the medicine-bag, and were encouraged by the gov- 
ernment for purposes of war." 

Nor is it a sufficient reply to say that the Jesuit 
Fathers lived and labored in a hot-bed of sav- 
age internecine warfare, while the gentle Breth- 
ren labored in a secluded field ; there is, indeed, 
truth in this, but there was also a difference in 
the ideals, methods, and spirit of the laborers. 

What we have just said suggests a single 
further observation. Perhaps no student is 
likely to find a richer store of material in these 
volumes than the student of what is sometimes 
called primitive culture. While bearing the 
universal marks of the savage man, the Amer- 
ican Indians are a peculiarly interesting race, 
in some respects sui generis. No other class of 
observers that had an opportunity to study 
them in the Northern and Central parts of 
North America were so competent to do so as 
the Jesuits. They were educated men, trained 
scholars and men of letters, painstaking and 
conscientious. Nor had any other observers so 
good an opportunity. They studied the Indians 
in their native seats, through a very wide geo- 
graphical range, for an extended period of time, 
and in hundreds of tribes and fragments of 
tribes. Further, the Jesuits saw the savages in 
their native state, and they reported what they 
saw so faithfully that the " Relations " seem to 
be a part of aboriginal nature a real scien- 
tific laboratory. 

It remains only to congratulate the editor, 
Mr. Thwaites, and the chief translator from the 
French, Mr. J. C. Covert, and the enterprising 
publishers, upon the happy opening of their 
large undertaking. As the editor calls for 
suggestions, we will observe that he makes a 
mistake in deferring the index to a final vol- 
ume. There should indeed be a complete index 
to the whole work when finished ; but it is an 
error not to provide indexes for the successive 
volumes as they appear. R ^ HlNSDALE<

MR. JAMES BRYCE ON THE ARMENIAN. 
QUESTION.* 

Mr. James Bryce comes to us this year with 
a new volume, entitled " Transcaucasia and 
Ararat," or, rather, with an old volume, origin- 
ally published in 1877, and now bound in with 
a recent and timely chapter on " The Armenian 
Question." The earlier and descriptive part 
of the book details a journey through Russian 
Transcaucasia and the Turkish cities on the 
Black Sea. Starting from the Nijni Fair, 
which, the author says, is losing in picturesque 
costume and in variety of national types, he 
proceeds by gentle declension on the Volga to 
Saratof ; and thence by rail across a corner of 
the Southern Steppe a wild waste of land, 
limitless as the ocean, where the horizon is un- 
changing, and there is sense of motion without 
progress, " the undefended side of Europe . . . 
through which all the Asiatic hordes, Huns, 
Alans, Avars, Bulgarians, Mongols " poured 
like a submerging flood. Contrary to popular 
supposition, the Steppe is not necessarily flat, 
low, or barren. It is simply open, treeless land, 
sometimes rolling, sometimes rich in loam, and 
sometimes desert. 

The country north of the Caucasus is fertile 
in the main and is capable of supporting a 
vast population, but it remains unturned soil. 
" Whatever Russia may want," says Mr. Bryce, 
" she does not want land, and has no occasion 
to annex Bulgaria or Armenia or any other 
country to provide an outlet for her superfluous 
children." The railroad ends at Vladikavaz, 
a town and fortress which command the en- 
trance to the famous Dariel Pass, the principal 
gateway of the Caucasian Range. The prodi- 
gious aspect of nature here impresses even the 
cultivated mind with terror. The bed of this 
savage gorge foams white with the mountain 
torrent, and the granite walls rise to a height 
of four thousand feet ; " behind are still loftier 
ranges of sharp, red pinnacles, broken, jagged, 
and terrible, their topmost summits flecked with 
snow." Shut within, protected and preserved 
by these mountain fastnesses, are many peoples. 
Thus the Caucasus is " a kind of ethnological 
museum, where specimens may be found of 
countless races and languages, some of which 
probably belong to the early ages of the world 
. . . races differing in religion, aspect, man-

ners, character." The Caucasus was the mys- 
terious boundary of the ancient world, the land 
of mythological marvel. Against the black 
precipices of Kazbek, a steep dome of snow, 
Prometheus hung in chains. Near by were the 
man-hating Amazons, the gold-guarding grif- 
fins, and Colchis, the goal of the Argonauts. 
The southern end of Dariel Pass opens into the 
country of the Georgians, " a race of jovial 
topers," whose women are celebrated for their 
beauty, albeit, to the Western taste, of an ex- 
pressionless kind. The land is rich in resources. 
There are great oil wells at Baku, on the Cas- 
pian Sea, and a railroad connects this port with 
Poti, on the Euxine, about which rice-fields lie. 
Coal, iron, and copper are found in the moun- 
tains, the forests include rare and valuable 
woods, cotton grows in the valley of the Araxes, 
the tea shrub thrives on the hills, and the fer- 
tile steppe promises generously to industry. 
Near the southern boundary is the capital, Tif- 
lis, a town of six nations, the Russians, who 
compose a pleasant and not intolerant official 
class ; the Germans, whose ancestors were 
driven hither from Wiirtemberg by a new 
hymn-book ; the Tartars, who are the carriers 
from the country about the Caspian Sea ; the 
slim, stealthy, lithe, and cat-like Persians, an 
industrious race of laborers and merchants, but 
" the greatest liars in the East "; and last, but 
also first, the Armenians a vigorous, pushing, 
trading, shopkeeping class, sharp men of busi- 
ness, thrifty, able to drive a hard bargain. 
" Like most successful people, they are envied 
and ill spoken of." In Tiflis there are few 
Jews. "The Armenians leave no room for 
them. All these peoples live side by side, sell- 
ing and working for hire, yet never coming into 
any closer union, remaining indifferent to one 
another, with neither love nor hate nor ambi- 
tion, peaceably obeying a government of stran- 
gers, who annexed them without resistance and 
retain them without effort, and held together by 
no bond but its existence." 

The author pushes his way across Russian 
Armenia, a desolate steppe country scorched 
with the fierce heats of summer and swept with 
the icy blasts of winter to Ararat, the meeting- 
point of three empires, the Russian, Turkish, 
and Persian ; Ararat the centre of the earth, 
the sacred, the white-crowned, where the ark 
of humanity, the drift of appalling ruin, found 
a mooring-place on this planet of ours. The 
Turkish Armenians, who live almost in sight 
of this mountain, might be pardoned for wish- 
ing that this craft, embryonic of infinite woe

and tears, had been scourged forever over the 
dark face of the deep, never to find a resting- 
place. The peak is an object of superstitious 
reverence to the people who live about it ; and 
as we watch Mr. Bryce begin the lower part 
of his ascent to the sublime height, mounted 
upon a horse and covered with an umbrella, we 
ourselves suffer the sense of a descent to the 
ridiculous. At the altitude of thirteen thou- 
sand feet, he finds a piece of gopher (?) wood, 
" a fragment of Noah's ark," which affords him 
some pleasantry ; and the summit, which he 
reaches alone, inspires appropriate reflection. 
Retracing his steps, he touches at Etchmiadzin, 
the seat of the Primate, or Katholikos, of the 
independent Armenian Church. Thence he 
goes to Poti, the " most fever-smitten den in 
Asia," where he embarks on a coasting voyage 
to Constantinople. 

It is imposible to epitomize in allowable 
space the record of Mr. Bryce's travels ; and 
this is to be regretted, for the reason that the 
narrative is dull a defect due largely, per- 
haps, to the fact that the country itself is de- 
pressingly dull. The author's account of the 
Armenians and their troubles possesses, how- 
ever, a vivid dramatic interest, and will reward 
perusal. Mr. Bryce is an accomplished and 
conscientious student of historic and social fact, 
and his data herein is authoritative, being de- 
rived from personal observation, from conver- 
sations with leading factors, and from the Blue 
Books containing the reports of English con- 
suls located in Asia Minor. 

The Armenians are a people, not a country. 
More than three millions of them live under 
Turkish rule, eight hundred thousand under 
Russian, and six hundred thousand under Per- 
sian. Despite various and oppressive govern- 
ment, they have persisted as a race and nation- 
ality since the time of Herodotus. Become 
passive under centuries of bondage,' they still 
cling loyally to the traditions of an independent 
existence, which ended in the eleventh century. 
Their christianization dates from the time of 
Tiridates the Great, who suffered a change of 
faith a few years before Constantino saw the 
vision of the Cross ; " Armenia is therefore the 
first country to have enjoyed the privileges of 
an ecclesiastical establishment." Although the 
allegiance of this people is divided between an 
independent patriarch at Etchmiadzin and one 
at Constantinople, who does homage to Rome, 
their religious differences are not vital. Religion 
is the common bond ; indeed, religion is to them 
everything, since " it includes their laws, their 



literature, and their customs, as well as their 
relation to the unseen world." But it is also 
an isolating and repellent force. 

"In ancient times there were in Western Asia and 
Europe pretty nearly as many religions as there were 
races, but these religions were not mutually exclusive, 
and required from their believers no hostility to other 
deities. Hence the ease with which the Roman empire 
drew so many diverse nations into its bosom, and formed 
out of them a sort of new imperial nationality. The 
rise of Christianity altered all this, since it claimed to 
be a world religion, which could own and brook no rival. 
Mohammedanism repeats the same claim." 

It follows that between the ruling Muslim and 
the subject Christian in Asia Minor there may 
be a truce, but there can be no lasting and vol- 
untary peace. During the past few years, 
nearly two hundred thousand Armenians have 
perished by sword, torture, fire, and famine ; 
and this enormous destruction of life, and of 
property as well, is distinctly traceable to re- 
ligious fanaticism, that inspired diabolism 
which still continues to drench the earth with 
blood. The effort of the Sultan to extend his 
Kalifate, or spiritual headship of the Ottoman 
Turks, to the entire Mohammedan world, from 
Morocco, through inner Arabia and Persia, to 
India, has stimulated the religious passions and 
intolerance of the Mussulmans, and they have 
proved to be a willing instrument in persecut- 
ing the Armenian Christians. The proximate 
cause of the persecution is, however, political. 
When, by the treaty of Berlin, the Armenians 
were made the wards of Europe, the Sultan 
was threatened either with the intervention of 
one or more of the six signatory powers, or 
with the erection within his dominions of an 
autonomous self-governing state. Remember- 
ing the loss of Bulgaria, he resolved upon a 
policy of conversion (a subsequent lapse from 
Islam being punishable with death) or exter- 
mination ; and many of the Armenians chose 
apostacy. Those who lived in the peasant vil- 
lage communities of the interior were the easi- 
est victims. Ever subject to the pillage of tax- 
gatherers and to attacks by marauding Kurds, 
spiritless from ages of slavery, unarmed and 
scattered, they could offer no effective resistance 
to organized massacre. Even in considerable 
towns, they were without the habits of com- 
bined action. At Urfa more than eight thou- 
sand of them perished, about a third of the 
number being killed or burned in a cathedral 
where they had taken refuge. What happened 
in Constantinople, the world knows. In fine, 
the whole Armenian country was given over 
to fire and sword, to atrocities nameless and

terrible. For these infamies, Mr. Bryee de- 
clares, the Sultan is personally responsible. 
"No one at Constantinople, from the ambas- 
sadors downwards, now doubts it." That the 
massacres were predetermined and instructed 
is circumstantially evident from the absorption 
of all administrative power in the person of the 
Sultan, and his laborious and minute interfer- 
ence with public affairs, the systematic nature 
of the slaughter, the participation of the 
Turkish soldiery, the arming of the Hamidieh 
cavalry, the active directing presence of some 
officials, the expressed belief of the Mussul- 
mans that they were doing the wishes of the 
Sultan, the fact that no assailant was punished 
while leading official participants were re- 
warded, the careful immunity of foreigners, 
the trumpet signal which sometimes began a 
massacre, and the formal religious procession 
which sometimes ended one, the destruction of 
such winter stores as could not be carried away, 
and, finally, the obstruction to benevolent aid 
from without the empire, all these constitute 
a chain of inculpatory facts which indicates a 
deliberate policy of extermination. 

The refusal of the signatory powers to inter- 
vene to prevent this wholesale murder is one of 
the most disgraceful happenings of modern his- 
tory. Russia could have protected the Armen- 
ians, because she maintains a standing army of 
150,000 men in Transcaucasia ; and this, in- 
deed, she engaged to do in a treaty made by 
her with Turkey at San Stefano, at the con- 
clusion of the last Turko-Russian War ; but 
this undertaking was superseded at the Treaty 
of Berlin, and by a separate pact made between 
England and Turkey. Thereupon, Russia be- 
came unsympathetic, sullen, and hostile to the 
Armenians, who, even in Russian dominions, 
now began to show disturbing signs of inde- 
pendent vitality. On the other hand, England 
undertook to do two contradictory things : to 
protect Turkish territory in Asia from Russia 
(in consideration of the cession of Cyprus), and 
to protect the Armenian Christians from Tur- 
key. In fulfilment of the second half of this 
contract, she sent consuls to Asia Minor and 
exacted many promises of reform from the 
Turkish Government ; but her repeated pro- 
tests in behalf of the Armenians have been 
effective only in irritating the Sultan and in 
driving him into the arms of Russia. Owing 
to mutual jealousies, the other powers showed 
but a languid interest in the Armenian trouble, 
and finally Germany intimated with brutal cyn- 
icism that she " cared nothing about the mat- 



ter, and that it had better be allowed to drop." 
Mr. Bryce pays a tribute to the American mis- 
sionaries, as being " the only good influence 
that has worked from abroad upon the Turkish 
Empire." Disinterested, earnest, and culti- 
vated men, they have brought the light of ed- 
ucation and of learning into dark places, and 
have inspired the Armenian youth with higher 
ideals of life. Wisely discouraging political 
agitation, as affording a pretext for massacre, 
and with equal wisdom working towards secu- 
lar rather than sectarian ends, they have suc- 
ceeded, in some places, in modifying appreci- 
ably the severity of Turkish persecution. 

Although Mr. Bryce does not predict the 
future, it is certain that the Sultan is rapidly 
approaching his doom. " From the Euphrates 
to the Bosphorus, all is silence, poverty, de- 
spair. . . . The Sultan's government has been 
reduced to such financial straits that no one in 
the public service is now paid, except the troops 
who guard the palace and the spies who carry 
secret reports to it." It is likely that the end 
will be partition, in the form of European pro- 
tectorates, with Russia the gainer. The tradi- 
tional English policy of " nursing the sick man" 
will be abandoned, and with small loss to En- 
gland, save that her trade in the Black Sea 
may pass through Russian custom-houses. As 
to her interest in the Suez Canal, military and 
naval authorities generally agree that, even to- 
day, in the event of a war with a Mediterranean 
power, it would be better for England to send 
her troops to India around the Cape of Good

THE PHILOSOPHY OP SCHOPENHAUER.* 

Schopenhauer once wrote to his satellite, 
Frauenstadt, in the following terms : " The 
time will come when he who does not know 
what I have said upon a given subject will be 
held an ignoramus." Forty years have passed 
since this particular prediction (but one among 
many of the writer's expressions of confidence 
in the enduring character of his philosophical 
system) was made, and the remark has been 
fairly justified by the event. It is not that the 
educated man of to-day is bound to know what 
Schopenhauer said upon every subject, but he 
is at least bound to know the main lines of his 
thought and its bearings upon the fundamental

problems of philosophy. If he seeks to know 
more than this he will at least not go unre- 
warded, for Schopenhauer illuminated and 
adorned all of the many subjects upon which 
he touched, and to read intelligently the whole 
body of his work is, as we said in these pages 
twelve years ago, in itself almost a liberal edu- 
cation. 

No apology is needed, then, for such a work 
as Professor Caldwell's recent monograph, and 
it is a little surprising that we should have had 
to wait so long for the appearance of such a 
study as this in the English language. We have 
long had good translations of Schopenhauer, 
readable biographies and essays, elaborate ex- 
aminations of the pessimism for which he chiefly 
stands with the average reader, and special 
expositions of his system in histories of phil- 
osophy and reviews scientific or popular. Pro- 
fessor Caldwell does not attempt to do any of 
these things over again, except as they are inci- 
dentally connected with the purpose stated in 
the following sentence : 

" I have rather tried to connect Schopenhauer with 
some few broad lines of philosophical and general 
thought, and so far as I could with some few broad 
principles of human nature." 

This statement is too modest by more than 
half, and needs to be supplemented by the fol- 
lowing analysis of the chapters into which the 
discussion falls : 

"The first chapter is general in its character, and 
suggests only the scope of Schopenhauer's significance 
and the spirit in which we ought to study his system. 
The next two chapters, I imagine, will demand a some- 
what closer attention on the part of the reader than the 
first. They constitute an attempt to trace out the theo- 
retical roots of Schopenhauer's philosophy. The fourth 
chapter occupies itself with the practical bondage of life, 
from which art and ethics and religion are supposed by 
many people (and by Schopenhauer himself) to set us 
free. The following four chapters present the Schopen- 
hauer that is known to the thought of the nineteenth 
century. Chapter IX. tries to show the fundamental 
philosophical character of Schopenhauer's thought. It 
takes up, incidentally, the threads of Chapters II. and 
III., and interweaves them with the other chapters of 
the book and with the system as a whole. Chapter X. 
attempts some general positive statement about Schopen- 
hauer. In it and in the Epilogue points are suggested 
which might form the material for further study and 
exposition." 

Having thus, with the author's help, got our 
orientation in the book, we may proceed to the 
discussion of a few of its more salient features. 
At the outset, we are met with a protest against 
the extent to which Schopenhauer's striking per- 
sonality is assumed to color his philosophy. " I 
am inclined to resent the practice of attributing 
the exaggerations of his philosophy to his per- 



sonality, when such attribution does not rest 
upon a broad perception of the philosophy of 
such a personality as Schopenhauer's." This is 
very justly as well as neatly put, and warns the 
reader against a tendency which is peculiarly 
dangerous in the case of the philosopher in ques- 
tion. " The feelings play a tremendous part in 
Schopenhauer's system," says Professor Cald- 
well, " and this certainly explains the human 
interest that attaches itself to his writings." A 
little further on we are told of " his marvellous 
personality, combining as it does to a more won- 
derful extent than that of any other man who 
ever lived the power for abstract speculation 
with an enormous vitality of force and feeling." 
The difficulty of subjecting the work of such a 
man to a process of purely intellectual analysis 
is very great, and it is no wonder that we are met 
with this preliminary note of warning. Having 
duly sounded the note, the author proceeds to 
indicate the way in which Schopenhauer turned 
the traditional philosophies topsy turvy, and 
found a new starting-point for his work of sys- 
tematic construction. " It is no doubt intellect- 
ually satisfactory to think the world downwards, 
or from the point of view of ' the whole '; man 
had done so for two thousand years before 
Schopenhauer, he had had gods and heroes for 
his ancestors, and 'trailed clouds of glory' 
after him, and the like. The nineteenth cen- 
tury began to look at the world from below 
upwards, and Schopenhauer was its philosoph- 
ical mouthpiece." He was among the forerun- 
ners of nineteenth century naturalism (some- 
thing very different, as the author points out, 
from the naturalism of the eighteenth century), 
" a naturalism whose real drift Schopenhauer 
divined before Comte and Darwin and Spencer 
had written." 

Considered thus with reference to his histor- 
ical position, Schopenhauer affords a peculiarly 
interesting subject for examination. Had he 
lived half a century later, he would have ac- 
cepted the philosophy of evolution, in its essen- 
tial features, without reserve, although he 
would have objected strenuously to some of its 
metaphysical implications. He would have 
made short work, for example, of Mr. Spencer's 
" Unknowable," and would have had for the 
materialism of Haeckel the same scorn that he 
had for the crass materialism of his own day. 
As it is, there is no very great difficulty in trans- 
lating his philosophical language into more 
modern forms of speech, and his theory of dis- 
tinct stages of the objectification of the will 
does not require much modification to become

a theory of the absolute continuity of develop- 
ment. His language has not escaped from the 
bondage of formalism, and his philosophy is 
expressed in terms of Kantian categories and 
Platonic " ideas," but it is really a philosophy 
of evolution, and is at heart convinced that 
nature makes no leaps. Professor Caldwell 
quotes the following suggestive passage : 

" If Nature had only taken its last step to man from 
an elephant instead of from an ape, how different would 
man then have been! He would have been an intelli- 
gent elephant, or an intelligent dog, instead of an intelli- 
gent monkey." 

And there is another passage, not quoted, in 
which he speaks of one species giving birth to 
another, zur glucklichen Stunde, in terms that 
are not Darwinian merely because the key of 
natural selection has never been put into the 
speaker's hands. Similarly, he anticipates mod- 
ern psychology in the passage which speaks of 
" first principles and abstract knowledge " as 
"the reservoir in which the disposition to act, 
which is the source of all moral conduct, and 
which does not exactly flow out into action at 
every moment, is kept stored up ready to flow 
through certain conducting channels, when the 
real occasion for action arrives." 

The formalism which stiffens Schopenhauer's 
philosophy in the stricter sense, and which ap- 
pears to his modern readers such a stumbling- 
block until they realize how easily it may be 
pushed aside, appears also in his treatment of 
such an extra-metaphysical subject as art. 

" His whole philosophy of art seems almost a phase 
of that glorification of Greek statuary and architecture 
which was a kind of worship in his days, with its Neo- 
Hellenism as opposed to crude Protestantism and Juda- 
istic theism. Schopenhauer certainly never felt the full 
force of the modern gospel of Romanticism, with its 
exaltation of the need of a free and expansive (and even 
fantastic and extravagant) sense for beauty and reality. 
It would probably have shocked him very much to think 
that there was color and ornament even in Greek stat- 
uary and architecture." 

But here again it is not difficult to translate 
his theory of art into terms sufficiently compre- 
hensive to embrace the very manifestations for 
which he had neither eye nor ear. Had 
Schopenhauer lived to hear the later works of 
Richard Wagner, he would probably have 
condemned them as barbaric, and argued con- 
vincingly (to himself) that they were inferior 
to the operas of Rossini. Yet Wagner's theory 
of art is confessedly based upon the principles 
laid down by Schopenhauer, who in this respect, 
as in so many others, builded better than he 
knew. 

The limitations of space forbid our discus- 



sion, in any exhaustive sense, of Professor 
Caldwell's work. The style of the writer is on 
the whole admirable. If at times it resorts to 
the sort of philosophical algebra that makes 
metaphysical exposition so difficult for the gen- 
eral reader, and if the light which it sheds upon 
its subject is often the dry light so character- 
istic of the Scotch philosophers, it can rise upon 
occasion to eloquent heights, and can draw for 
illustrative comment upon the stories of a cul- 
tured and finely-balanced mind. Sometimes, 
the neatness of the style is the chief element in 
our satisfaction, as in the following passage : 
" Agnosticism may lead to mere empty Pyrrhonism, 
which is too thin and useless to be taken seriously; or 
it may lead to mysticism, which is not philosophy. Ag- 
nosticism generally does lead, in the case of those who 
profess it, to an airy empiricism in theory and practice, 
which substitutes brilliant or incisive utterances for 
reasoned beliefs and impressions, and sensations for 
ideas and thoughts. The only possible attitude of the 
mind to the world, if we are bent on learning the mean- 
ing of things, is a direct one, and not a general paraly- 
sis before such self-created barriers as the imaginary 
and spurious distinction between phenomenon and nou- 
menon." 

With this extract may go another to show that 
Schopenhauer by no means fell a victim to such 
paralysis. 

"The intellectual side of things is to him merely 
phenomenal and phantasmal, merely ideal and not real; 
on the other hand, the volitional side of things is sub- 
stantial and actual, real and not ideal. There is some- 
thing healthy in this thought, and indeed Schopenhauer 
appeals to one because he teaches throughout all his 
writings that knowledge is a poor thing at best, a kind 
of indirect way of apprehending reality, and that in 
order really to understand things one must feel them, 
must to a certain extent be them, energise with them, 
or energise with the great cosmic agency that we call 
the world-will." 

Something of Schopenhauer's own marvellous 
feeling for style seems to have become the pos- 
session of the author when he writes as follows : 
" Schopenhauer knew what beauty was, but he did 
not appreciate it in his soul as Sophocles did. To him 
beauty was only a ' light ' not the spontaneous and 
joyoua creation of a full sense for reality, but a feeble 
fair flicker the ' light ' and the steady gaze ' on the 
face of genius,' or the gleam of rest and repose ' that 
often appears on the faces of those who die after extreme 
suffering. He evidently came at the end of his life, 
through reflection upon poetry and music as universal 
arts, to appreciate art as the outcome of a healthy and 
refined general sense for things, but this feeling repre- 
sented a summit of effort towards which he had strug- 
gled during the course of his life, and not a level of 
attainment from which he could always calmly survey 
the realm of beauty." 

We are not sure that this is quite fair to Scho- 
penhauer, but there can be no doubt that it is 
strikingly and beautifully expressed.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Professor Caldwell deserves our thanks for 
his treatment of Schopenhauer's pessimism. To 
the average person, Schopenhauer stands for 
pessimism and nothing else. Yet his pessim- 
ism was really a matter of temperament and 
environment rather than of philosophical prin- 
ciple, and we are opportunely reminded that 
Schopenhauer rarely makes use of the word. 
As far as his pessimism was the result of en- 
vironment, its causes are briefly summarized 
in the statement that " he was an unregenerate 
youth, living in some of the most trying years 
of this century, with no one country that he 
cared about in particular, and no relations or 
friends for whom he had any real affection." 
His pessimism was accidental rather than essen- 
tial, and the author is well-advised in giving it 
a subordinate place in his analysis. Schopen- 
hauer's primary assumption that all pleasure is 
negative was never proved by him, although he 
made the assertion over and over again, nor is 
it susceptible of proof. Rather is it open to abso- 
lute disproof by anyone who will interrogate his 
own experience and honestly accept the answer. 
So much for pessimism in the absolute sense. 
As for the other sense, the sense in which it 
means the firm grasp and unblinking view of 
life in its totality, poets and philosophers and 
religious teachers are well-nigh unanimous in 
their recognition of the futility of a great part 
of human endeavor, of the illusory nature of 
much of the happiness that men consciously 
pursue, and of the ignoble aims of any philos- 
ophy that is hedonistic and nothing more. 
" II ne s'agit pas d'etre heureux," says Kenan, 
" il s'agit d'etre parf ait," and this is the sub- 
stance of Schopenhauer's pessimism in its 
nobler aspect, in the only aspect in which it has 
serious claims upon our attention. 

A few not very important criticisms may 
close this review. The book is so exception- 
ally well printed that such occasional slips as 
" Nietsche " and " Frauenstadt " stand out all 
the more prominently. There is no more reason 
for saying " von Hartmann " than there is for 
saying " von Goethe." The split infinitive " to 
fully characterize " occurs to mar the author's 
usually correct style. We must take exception 
to a few of Professor Caldwell's dicta, to the 
statement, " There is little that is noble in 
Schopenhauer," and to the statement, " Most 
thinkers are now prepared to admit that con- 
scious existence for self or conscious person- 
ality is something that we do not find lower 
down in the biological scale than man." In 
the remark that " the final process of the 



world Schopenhauer absurdly imagines to be 
downwards or backwards," we object vigor- 
ously to the adverb. The following seems to 
us an unfair statement of Schopenhauer's the- 
ory of the will : " There is much in the thought 
that the reality of the world and of the individ- 
ual consists in will ; but the will that should 
be selected for this honour is rational purpose 
and achievement, and not mere atomic attrac- 
tion and repulsion, or mere organic reaction to 
what is called external stimulus." A good deal 
of the discussion concerning Schopenhauer's 
theory of art appears to be mere play upon 
words, as the following sentences will illustrate : 
" Art must not be thought to take us out of 
reality, but more deeply into reality." " He 
ought to have brought art infinitely into life 
instead of taking it infinitely out of life." 
Finally, we note the misquotation (besteht for 
entsteht) of a familiar passage from " Faust." 
Such matters as these are, however, but slight 
blemishes upon a work remarkable for its 
acuteness, sympathy, and knowledge, and for 
its successful analysis of the most important 
system of philosophy that has appeared during 
the post-Kantian period.

BIRD LORE AND BIRD LOVE.* 



During the sessions of the World's Congress 
in the Memorial Art Palace in the never-to-be- 
forgotten year 1893, a group of enthusiasts in 
the study of ornithology organized a series of 
meetings for the consideration of their favorite 
branch of science. The movement was initiated 
so late in the season that but a scanty time was 
allowed for the arrangement of details and the 
preparation of papers ; nevertheless, a gratify- 
ing degree of interest was aroused, and large 
audiences assembled on the days appointed, 
toward the close of the month of October. The 
late Rev. David Swing delivered the opening 
address ; the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Pro- 
fessor D. D. McCormick, and other earnest 
speakers, followed. The papers presented by 
special investigators or observers in the domain 
of bird-life were characterized by a commend- 
able degree of serious thought and original 
research, and, notwithstanding the haste with 
which they were called forth, were worthy of 
praise from a literary point of view. They

were too valuable, in fact, to be lost from 
sight, and a select number twenty-seven, all 
told have been gathered into a handsome 
octavo volume. The edition is limited to six 
hundred copies, an inadequate number, one 
would think, judging from the excellence and 
importance of the work ; yet the readers to 
whom it appeals are probably still a small, 
though we trust a constantly enlarging, circle. 

The names of some of our foremost ornithol- 
ogists are found in the index of authors ; for 
example, Dr. Elliott Coues, Mr. J. A. Allen, 
and Mr. Frank M. Chapman, each of whom 
speaks with authority on the subject which he 
treats. An interesting variety marks the con- 
tributions offered, each article bringing for- 
ward some peculiar point in the general topic. 
In his opening address as President of the 
Congress, Dr. Coues calls particular attention 
to the enormous utility of birds, quoting as one 
item of evidence that " the total output of the 
poultry industry, in the shape of hens' eggs 
alone, exceeds annually that of all the mines of 
gold, silver, and other precious metals." 

Mr. Chapman's paper gives an ingenious 
account of " The Ornithology of Columbus's 
First Voyage." Now Columbus, in all prob- 
ability, did not know one bird from another, 
being presumably as ignorant of these exquisite 
creatures as the great bulk of mankind remain 
to the present day ; yet the record of his mo- 
mentous trip across the Atlantic yields data 
from which the skilled ornithologist gains val- 
uable hints regarding the movements of birds 
during the period of their autumnal migration. 
It was the birds, as Dr. Fiske has shown, who 
guided Columbus to the Bahamas, thereby 
shortening his perilous voyage and possibly 
saving himself and his mighty project from 
destruction by a mutinous crew. The presence 
of small land-birds about his little fleet of cara- 
vels, when they were seven or eight hundred 
miles from the nearest shore, renewed in the 
hearts of the sailors their lost hope and forti- 
tude, and, hovering about the vessels from time 
to time in the weeks following, enabled the 
heroic leader to control his rebellious men until 
the coast-line of San Salvador was sighted. 

Despite the agreeable diversity manifest in 
this assemblage of papers, there is a sorrowful 
plaint sounded in most of them over the de- 
struction which is unceasingly waged against 
the birds of beautiful plumage throughout the 
world. Chief of the miscreants engaged in 
this pitiless warfare is the mercenary assassin 
who prowls about the fields and hedgerows to 



slay the innocents for the gratification of fem- 
inine vanity. In a paper on " The Herons of 
Central Florida," Mr. T. Gibert-Pearson de- 
scribes the sorrowful scene witnessed by him in 
a devastated heronry in which the plume-hunter 
had but lately accomplished his fiendish work. 

" Under a bunch of grass a dead heron was discovered, 
from whose hack the plumes had not been torn. The 
ground was still moist with its blood, showing that death 
had not long before taken place. The dirt had been 
beaten smooth with its wings; its neck was arched; the 
feathers on its head were raised ; and its bill was buried 
in the clotted feathers of its breast, where a gaping 
wound showed where the leaden missile had struck. It 
was an awful picture of pain. Sorely wounded, this 
heron had crawled away, and after enduring hours of 
agony had died, the victim of a foolish passion. Young 
herons had been left by scores in the nests, to perish 
from exposure and starvation. These little sufferers, 
too weak to rise, reached their heads over the nests and 
faintly called for the food which the dead mothers could 
never bring." 

Would it be more than a just retribution, if each 
woman who wears on her bonnet an aigrette 
torn from the back of a murdered heron, or the 
wing or body of any of the feathered species so 
cruelly slaughtered to furnish her a barbarous 
decoration, should be compelled to hear the cries 
of the starving nestlings moaning in her ear, and 
to feel in her heart the pang of the dying parent 
snatched from the care of its helpless young, 
should be compelled to hear and feel all this 
until she repent of her inhumanity ? It rests 
with women to suppress the fearful traffic in 
the skins of murdered birds for the supply of 
the milliner's demand. It is said that eight 
millions of these loveliest beings in the animate 
world had their gentle lives put out, in answer 
to fashion's brutal call in the city of Chicago 
alone, last autumn. How can such things be, 
and we lay any claim to advance in civilization ? 
It rests with women, too, to stop the wanton 
destruction of our song-birds by the sling and 
the small gun in the hands of ruthless boys, 
who kill every living thing in sight for the mere 
fun of killing. 

We are our own worst enemies in allowing 
such deplorable work to continue ; for when 
bird-life ends, plant life will end likewise, and 
human life swiftly follow. It is the birds that 
save our crops of every kind from the devour- 
ing insects, and in their loss we lose a service 
on which it is scarcely too much to say that 
our very existence depends. But women and 
small boys are not the only culprits of human 
kind worthy of blame for the destruction of our 
feathered friends. The collector who, under 
the pretense of furthering science or of stock-

ing a private cabinet, shoots and plunders with- 
out mercy, shares in full the guilt of the crime. 
It is sickening to read, in every number of every 
periodical devoted to ornithology, the stories 
of nest-robbing and bird-killing by men who 
have had a mother and perhaps have children 
of their own, and yet show no pity for the be- 
ings whose devotion and fidelity to their mates 
and their young is not parallelled by the race 
holding the highest rank in the animal world.

FOLK-TALES FOR YOUNG AND OLD.* 

Folk-tales appear to be particularly in vogue, 
judging from the three collections that have 
lately come to hand. Usually there are but two 
excuses that can be urged for the publishing of 
a book of folk-tales. One of them is the desire 
to supply children with stories ; the other, to 
provide the student with material for serious 
study. Grimm's " Household Stories " met 
both needs ; many later collections meet neither. 
There should be no doubt that the folk-tales of 
his own ethnic group form wholesome food for 
the child-mind. At a certain age most children 
live in fairyland ; to such among us the dear old 
stories of the German or the English folk have 
a real charm. Teachers do not do ill to recog- 
nize this fact ; and at present many of them 
dole out such material to their little learners. 
But it is just as certain that the folk-tales of 
other ethnic groups have little interest or 
attractiveness to our small savage or barbarian. 
It is enough for his little mind to be crammed 
with gnomes and elves and brownies who think 
and act somewhat in our own fashion. Both 
theoretically and practically, he cannot and 
ought not to be given all kinds of foreign imag- 
inings. 

For the student, folk-tales of a given people 
should be seriously told, as nearly as may be 
in the native words and style. The collection 
should rarely be a selection, but should be as 
complete as prolonged study and collecting can 
make it. Either the tales should be given sim- 
ply and without comment, or there should be 
scholarly notes going to the very marrow and 
heart of the stories, discussing both expression

and thought, and presenting the character and 
life of the people from whom they come. If illus- 
trated, the book should contain only necessary, 
helpful, and instructive pictures ; it should also 
be honestly printed, in a compact form, conven- 
ient for use. The same book should not aim 
to please both the child in the nursery and the 
student in the library, though occasionally it 
may do so. 

Probably these propositions, in their abstract 
form, will meet with ready acceptance. When 
they are applied to the three books before us 
we become critical. The " Totem Tales " are 
intended for small readers ; yet we have a 
" preface " for which no child will care, a 
" credit mention " which can mean nothing to 
children, and twelve pages of " vocabulary and 
historical appendix " which all " wee tots " will 
skip. That the two " wee tots " Laura and Elden 
were delighted by the narration of these stories, 
we may believe ; but they would probably have 
been also delighted if the tales were told, vigor- 
ously and with animation, in the Chinook jargon. 
For boys and girls to listen to stories is one 
thing ; for them to enjoy reading them is another. 
The book shows much hard work ; it breathes 
an honest and enthusiastic spirit ; it contains 
considerable suggestive matter for older people ; 
but it is not a good book for children who have 
enough Aryan fairies without Indian skallala- 
toots, and enough witches without Quootshois. 
If meant for adults, the style should be changed, 
the book condensed to half its present size, and 
all the illustrations except the Indian pictures 
omitted. The stories are told in the region 
of Puget Sound; but they represent several 
mythic groups, and the native pictures are all 
Haidah. The notes are unsatisfactory, being 
often indefinite or even misleading. 

Professor Brun's " Tales of Languedoc " 
have a certain general literary value. The 
book is not aimed at small children ; it does 
not claim to be important to the student ; the 
author distinctly invites " to the hearth a wider 
circle." The book really appeals to this wider 
circle. Children will like the stories, which are 
daintily told. For folk-lorists the collection is 
meagre, there being but half-a-dozen tales. But 
the ordinary reader of adult years, who delights 
in good literature and in the life of simple folk, 
will enjoy the book heartily. In these times of 
sensational literature, the narrative of days 
when young men facing life all longed " to 
make the tour of France " is wholesome. 

The collection of Slav Fairy Tales comprises 
twenty fairy stories ; " principally they are

intended " for the young folk, but " it is hoped 
that older readers will find some additional 
interest in tracing throughout the many evi- 
dences of kinship between these stories and 
those of more pronounced Eastern origin." 
There is no question that young people will 
like the stories, which are well told notwith- 
standing their double translation and are 
vital with Aryan emotion and thought. Slav 
tales are becoming quite common in English 
dress, both for young people and students. 
We cannot discuss their character in detail. 
While some of the stories in this collection are 
probably new in English, they present many of 
the characteristic features shown by those 
already translated. FREDERICK STARR. 



SOME PROBLEMS or MODERN 
PSYCHOLOGY.* 



The four volumes included in the present survey 
may well serve as illustrations of the diversity of 
the questions upon which the modern psychologist 
seeks and gives light. They are equally illustrative 
of the international character of the contributors to 
this department of knowledge : the one author is 
an Italian, the second a German, the third a French- 
man, while the fourth, though writing in this coun- 
try, is an Englishman with considerable German 
training. 

With regard to Professor Mosso's work on 
" Fear," the reviewer's first duty is to make known 
the charm of the author's presentation, and the fas- 
cination of his treatment of a subject upon which 
he has labored with great ingenuity and success. 
It is a brilliant example of a bit of popular scientific 
writing, popular not by any sacrifice of accuracy 
or dignity of presentation, but by the author's strong 
conviction of the deeply human interest of his sub- 
ject ; and by his ability to express bis results in a 
significant and attractive form. It may well be 
doubted whether a popular scientific work of this 
flavor could originate outside of Southern Europe ; 
the Anglo-Saxon scientist would certainly hesitate 
to throw so much of his own personality into the 
account of his researches, to mingle social and moral 
reflections with descriptions of experiments and de- 
fence of conclusions. In Professor Mosso's hands 
the result is to give the reader a refreshing glimpse

of a genial and enthusiastic devotee of science and 
to imbue many of his pages with the exhilarating 
charm of a fascinating story. To recommend the 
book as a model for others to follow would, however, 
be a venturesome step. 

The title of the book is somewhat misleading ; its 
general subject is the Physiology of the Emotions, 
amongst which fear is treated somewhat fully, but 
by no means to the exclusion of other important 
topics ; while the general introduction upon the rela- 
tions of mental states to bodily states forms one of 
the most valuable portions of the work. This is 
indeed the keynote of his problem, the gaining of a 
physiological insight into tbe nature of the emotions. 
" The time has come when we must throw off our 
professional robes, tie on our aprons, roll up our 
sleeves, and begin the vivisection of the human 
heart according to scientific methods." Blushing, 
trembling, pallor, the quickening of the heart-beat 
and the respiration, the distortion of the facial mus- 
cles, weeping, the frown, the cry, cold perspiration, 
cold shivers, goose-skin, momentary paralysis, and 
the like, these are the symptoms the explanation 
of which attract Professor Mosso's abilities. In 
part this is the problem of Darwin, whose researches 
in the expression of the emotions are frequently 
cited and discussed ; but the physiological aspect is 
more particularly dwelt upon, and leads repeatedly 
to a refutal of the conclusions suggested by zoolog- 
ical considerations alone. It is hardly possible to 
discuss within the present limits these conclusions 
and their evidence ; but some attempt may be made 
to suggest the author's fertility in experiment. 

One of Professor Mosso's most valuable re- 
searches proved most strikingly the exquisitely deli- 
cate relation between blood-supply and emotional 
or mental disturbance. He constructed a balance- 
table resting on knife-edges, on which the subject 
could recline, while delicate apparatus recorded the 
heart-beat as well as the slightest divergence of this 
" scientific cradle " from the position of perfect 
equilibrium. The slightest change in the occupa- 
tion, a sudden noise, talking to the subject, listening 
to music, reading, even the change from the familiar 
Italian to the translating from Homer, caused reg- 
ular changes in the rate and nature of the pulse. 
Another instrument devised by the author to register 
similar changes is the plethysmograph, which con- 
sists essentially of a glass cylinder large enough to 
contain the arm, and so connected that the slightest 
change in the volume of the arm as determined by 
the flow of blood toward or away from the arm, is 
delicately recorded. While the apparatus was ap- 
plied to one of his subjects in the laboratory of the 
eminent Leipsic physiologist, Professor Ludwig, the 
latter walked into the room, whereupon the volume 
of the arm instantly and markedly decreased, the 
blood being drawn off to the brain by the mental dis- 
turbance. The eminent professor noted his appre- 
ciation of the significance of the experiment by 
marking on the record at the point of the disturb- 
ance caused by his own appearance on the scene,

" Der Lowe kommt " (" Enter the lion "). Similar 
effects are shown upon dogs ; the printed record of 
the change in a dog's pulsation caused by the sight 
of a gun or the click of the trigger is more eloquent 
than much description. Still more remarkable are 
the cases in which, owing to an injury to the skull, 
the apparatus could be directly applied to the ex- 
posed brain. Such a patient is being observed as he 
falls asleep ; the pulsations gradually become regu- 
lar and smooth, like the disappearance of the ripples 
from the surface of a sheet of water. 

" At length Bertino fell asleep. Consciousness was 
extinguished, the troublous thoughts of life had ceased ; 
only the last sentinels of the nervous system were still 
vigilant. At the slightest noise, a wave of blood dis- 
turbed the surface of the brain. If the hospital clock 
struck the hour, or someone walked along the terrace, 
if I moved my chair or wound up my watch, or if a 
patient coughed in the next room everything, the 
slightest sound, was accompanied by a marked altera- 
tion in the circulation of the brain, all immediately 
traced by the pen which the brain guided on the paper 
of my registering apparatus." 

After Bertino had slept an hour and a half, Pro- 
fessor Mosso arose and gently called his name. He 
did not stir, but the blood circulation was markedly 
altered, and even the noise made in the rising from 
the chair left its trace on the pulse record. 

This minute interaction between emotion and 
some physiological change, between thought and its 
expression, this conviction that our feelings and 
our reflections are writ large in our bodily system, 
if only we can render the record legible, domi- 
nates all of the author's inquiries ; and there is per- 
haps no one among contemporaneous workers who 
has contributed more to the proof and development 
of this conception than Professor Mosso. The ap- 
pearance of some portion of his results in an English 
form is a deserved tribute to their value, a tribute 
rendered several years ago by the German and the 
French edition of this work. 

The notion that the great man, in his striking 
divergence from popular standards of thought, feel- 
ing, and action, is somehow akin to the madman 
who is equally out of touch with the average man, 
has been the frequent subject of epigram, from 
Plato and Aristotle to Shakespeare and Dryden. 
The problem thus suggested has been repeatedly 
presented in recent years in the light of modern 
psychological study ; and it is as a strictly psycho- 
logical problem that Dr. Hirsch, the author of 
" Genius and Degeneration," proposed to treat it ; 
although, as will appear presently, with a distinctly 
timely motif. The useful discussion of the relations 
between genius and insanity would seem to be de- 
pendent upon an understanding of what is meant by 
genius and what by insanity. The most various 
conceptions of genius have been entertained ; a 
great deal of hard thinking has been expended in 
drawing a distinction between genius and talent ; 
much of this seems to be dominated by a desire to 
keep the great man in a class sui generis, unap- 



proachable through the avenues of cleverness, pains- 
taking ability, and success. Quite the contrary 
notion has been likewise entertained, making the 
genius nothing more than the development to an 
unusual degree of the qualities distinguishing the 
leaders, great and small, of mankind, " the infinite 
capacity for taking pains." Some have seemed 
to discover the true secret of genius in the uncon- 
sciousness, the inspiration, of his work ; others in his 
marked originality ; others in the keenness of his 
sensibilities and the vividness of his imagination ; 
others again in his irresistible impulse toward, his 
passion for, self-expression. Insanity, likewise, is a 
term not easily defined ; when the doctors discuss 
the classification of insanity their differences in con- 
ceptions of the nature of the condition at once ap- 
pear ; and when the doctor and the lawyer come 
into conflict over this mooted point, the expectation 
of any mutually satisfactory result is quite idle. 
None the less, the underlying essentials of the 
insane condition are sufficiently well understood to 
enable an alienist, such as Dr. Hirsch, to bring to 
the study of his problem a practical notion of what 
insanity is. We may be quite certain of where the 
centre of an infected district lies, even if we do not 
know how far it extends on all sides ; we can point 
out the focus, even if we cannot draw the boundary 
lines of the penumbra. 

The outlook for tracing a definite relation be- 
tween terms so vaguely defined is certainly not very 
promising ; and it cannot be claimed that the light 
of psychological science has as yet penetrated very 
far into the obscurity of this field. The cause of 
this failure lies to a very considerable extent in the 
inherent imperfections of the data. The study of 
individuals is always difficult ; there is the constant 
difficulty of separating the essential and typical from 
the accidental ; with regard to most men of genius, 
the facts most valuable for such an investigation 
are unknown, the interest in observing or recording 
such facts being distinctly a modern acquisition. 
There is, again, the question of how far imperfec- 
tions and abnormalities would be revealed in the 
lives of average mortals if the biographical search- 
light were turned upon them. And there is still 
another difficulty, as serious perhaps as any, in the 
requirement of treating as a group a number of 
individuals who have frequently so little in common 
and who present such striking individualities and 
differences. 

The author of " Genius and Degeneration " brings 
to the discussion of this problem as keen and com- 
prehensive an insight into its nature and difficulties 
as any recent contributor to this field. He perhaps 
does not add appreciably to our knowledge of the 
subject; but he presents the problem ably and 
attractively. He points out the essential weakness 
of such theories as that of Dr. Lombroso, whose 
conception of genius is so elastic that any divergence 
from commonplaceness may be included in it, and 
who carefully checks up every personal foible and 
trick of mind and body as a mark of mental instabil- 



1897.]

ity. The author shows clearly that the same outward 
traits may appear in the insane and in the genius ; 
and yet these traits will be psychologically diverse. 
In the same way, two men may rise to eminence in 
allied fields Goethe and Schiller are the author's 
favorite examples and yet the psychological na- 
ture of their distinction be entirely different. This 
insistence upon the necessity of a comparability of 
the mental faculties involved in different kinds of 
genius is important, and characterizes the entire 
discussion. On the other hand, full recognition is 
given to the fact that morbid characteristics abound 
in the lives of great men. To send the arrow to the 
highest mark, the cord must be stretched to its 
utmost ; and what wonder if it occasionally snaps ! 
Great men are to madness near allied, but the more 
precise nature of this connection is still a perplexing 
problem. 

Dr. Hirsch's volume is not wholly devoted to the 
discussion of genius ; it is equally concerned with 
the much-talked-of degeneration which is supposed 
to be a marked characteristic of our times. In this 
respect the author takes up a position antagonistic 
to Dr. Nordau, and proceeds at considerable length, 
and with a long review of evidence, to show the 
groundlessness of Nordau's alarm. He has no dif- 
ficulty in exhibiting Nordau as a dilettante in psy- 
chology, who applies his two lashes, degeneration 
and hysteria, without justice and without discrim- 
ination ; but the tone of this discussion is too contro- 
versial for the English reader. And although the 
chapter on Wagner and the chapter on Art and 
Insanity make interesting reading, the work must 
depend for its more permanent value upon the 
earlier chapters dealing with Genius and Insanity. 

The general impression which the reader is likely 
to carry away from a reading of M. Binet's " Alter- 
ations of Personality " will be that of a bewildering 
array of curious, interesting, and puzzling facts and 
cases ; that, indeed, the mind of man is fearfully 
and wonderfully made. The central topic of the 
discussion is the nature of the subconscious and auto- 
matic mental activities ; and the facts are derived 
from the study of natural somnambulism, of mo- 
mentary and protracted distraction, of the varied 
phenomena of hypnotism, of the protean forms of 
hysteria, and of other obscure forms of nervous 
derangement. The thesis to be supported by the 
analysis of cases is the existence of multiple person- 
alities, of various egos, at times successively, at 
times simultaneously in one individual ; such per- 
sonalities being more or less ignorant of, and yet in 
part connected with, one another. The array of 
evidence begins with the description of a few as- 
tounding cases, which certainly seem to admit of no 
other interpretation than that of a complete dissolu- 
tion of the personality. The most interesting case 
is that of a French soldier who, in consequence of a 
bullet wound in the brain, developed a most astound- 
ing aggregation of mental symptoms. At indefi- 
nite intervals he passes within a few seconds from 



his normal condition to the abnormal one the 
latter being characterized by the loss of all the 
senses save touch, by a complete absence of all initia- 
tive in his movements, by a reduction to a state of 
total automatism. His sense defects, however, are 
not real, not physiological, but of that complicated 
mentally inhibited type characteristic of hysteria. 
With this as the extreme case, the author proceeds 
to other similar cases, and then takes up an ex- 
tended series of observations of hypnotised hyster- 
ical subjects ; the constant symptoms in these cases 
being some form of anaesthesia and the possibility 
of exciting subconscious action through the stimula- 
tion of the anaesthetic surfaces. The phenomena of 
distraction, of suggestion, and of automatic writing 
are studied in some detail, and are further illus- 
trated in the presentation from the author's point of 
view of the more generally recognized hypnotic phe- 
nomena in normal subjects, post-hypnotic sugges- 
tion, negative hallucinations, suggested alterations of 
personality, and the like ; and finally the same prin- 
ciples of explanation are applied to the phenomena 
of table-moving, rapping, and spirit messages. 

The main value of M. Binet's book, which sanc- 
tions the present translation, lies in its discern- 
ing and unprejudiced collection of cases ; it is a 
valuable reference book for those desirous of know- 
ing the kind of work upon which the students of 
abnormal psychology, particularly in France, have 
been engaged within recent years. The subject 
treated is very abstruse and obscure, and it is no 
disparagement of the gifted author's endeavors to 
say that the total outcome of his researches is unsat- 
isfactory both in kind and amount. As a matter 
of method, as well as for other reasons, it would 
unquestionably be better -r- as the sponsor of the 
English edition, Professor Baldwin, points out to 
begin with those cases diverging least from normal 
every-day experience, and gradually lead up to the 
complete dissolutions of personality. Had this been 
done it would have deprived the term " alterations 
of personality " of its extreme and forbidding sig- 
nificance ; and have made it clear to the reader that 
when he goes on copying from a text by mere force 
of habit while his mind is elsewhere, or fails to 
hear the clock tick, but can afterwards resuscitate 
the ticks from the subconscious, or cannot remember 
whether he has wound his watch or not and finds 
that he has done so, but not consciously, that in 
these cases the perceiving and the acting agent is 
somewhat different from the normal fully conscious 
self. The author has also laid himself open to the 
charge of neglecting the accurate description of the 
conditions of his experiments, a fault always seri- 
ous in scientific work, and particularly so in this field 
when the sources of error are so many and so dif- 
ficult to avoid. A book including fewer cases, more 
accurately described, more systematically arranged, 
more concisely treated, would certainly have created 
a stronger impression of scientific method and re- 
sults than is done by M. Binet's volume. Pioneer 
work, however, can never be architecturally perfect.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



It still remains for some discerning compiler to 
bring together the various facts of this fascinating 
but treacherous study, in a form at once scientific, 
attractive, and pedagogical. 

The problem which Professor Titchener attempts 
to solve in his " Outline of Psychology " is of great 
practical importance, especially in this country, 
where, perhaps more than in any other, attention is 
given to psychology as an educational discipline. 
This problem is the satisfaction of the demand for 
a clear, readable, scientific, and fairly comprehen- 
sive elementary text-book for the student and gen- 
eral reader. It can hardly be said that there is any 
general agreement, either as to the fact material or 
the method of presentation, among the " Psycholo- 
gies " of to-day. If one takes up a similar group 
of text-books in physics or physiology, one finds a 
very marked similarity and concordance, the dif- 
ferences being confined in the main to minor points 
of treatment and special emphasis of certain facts 
or methods. Very likely the suitable text-book will 
emerge as the result of a process of selection from 
among many and diverse trials ; and for the present 
the professional psychologist and the interested 
reader must be content to welcome every able con- 
tribution, and be thankful for so much of light and 
aid as it may give. As a contribution both able 
and useful, Professor Titchener's volume will un- 
questionably find, as it deserves, a most cordial wel- 
come. In many ways it is the most serviceable 
text-book of psychology from a modern scientific 
point of view that has been written. 

The method is analytic, the main stress being laid 
upon the discovery and description of the simplest 
elements of which mental life is composed ; and fol- 
lowing this the combination and elaboration of these 
elementary processes into the varied activities of 
mind demand attention, while the connection of these 
with physiological conditions is considered, though 
not prominently so, throughout. The experimental 
method is adhered to, and, indeed, the author claims 
to present only " the most important results of ex- 
perimental psychology." Bearing this in mind, it 
is somewhat disappointing to find the really exper- 
imental results treated in so step-motherly a fashion ; 
it is true they are always cited, but their mode of 
citation would frequently seem to give color to the 
view that the principles involved are established by 
other facts and methods, and merely receive a cer- 
tain acceptable, though not indispensable, corrobora- 
tion from the experimental evidence. That this 
impression is not intended is quite clear, and it very 
likely results, similar to the equally unfortunate 
absence of all mention of the sources of the experi- 
mental data and of references to further informa- 
tion, from a desire for the greatest possible con- 
densation. 

As was indicated above, the psychological leaders 
are not yet in complete harmony as to either doctrine 
or practice ; and Professor Titchener is in a measure 
an adherent of a school within a school. He is an ex- 



perimentalist, but clings to the special interpreta- 
tion of certain fundamental principles which is char- 
acteristic of Wundt and his disciples ; and to this he 
adds an adherence to " the traditional English Psy- 
chology." The result of this extremely definite 
position, consciously and consistently maintained, is 
to make the work clear, exact in expression, system- 
atic, methodical. The reader cannot but feel that 
the author has strong convictions as to what is to 
be said, when and where it is to be said, and how it 
is to be said. Admirable as these characteristics 
are, it is much to be feared that they will detract 
from the inspirational value of the work to the be- 
ginner. In brief, the work lacks suggestiveness ; 
the outlines are too complete in itself, too severe and 
unadorned. It may be said, however, and with 
truth, that this is precisely the point at which the 
teacher should supplement his text-book. Notwith- 
standing these failings and there are a few other 
peculiarities which might be mentioned in the same 
class the work is thoroughly good and useful. It 
is not an ideal text-book, but is in many respects as 
close an approximation to the ideal now entertained 
in the minds of the teachers of psychology as any 
recent writer has been able to prepare. 

JOSEPH JASTROW. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The reviewer attacks Mr. Nathan 
The literature of Haskell Dole's variorum edition of 

Omar Khayyhm. . _ _ , 

the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 
published in two handsome volumes by the Joseph 
Knight Co., with a feeling that the editor's task has 
been not unlike that of " breaking a butterfly," and 
that all this ponderous enginery of annotation and 
illustration might better have been reserved for 
some less modest and more voluminous poet. After 
the volumes have been examined, the same reviewer 
is ready to "take back" whatever a priori objec- 
tions he may have made, and to express instead 
something of the gratitude which he feels for a piece 
of work so interesting and so thoroughly well done. 
The edition proves its own justification and needs 
no theoretical defence or apology. It consists essen- 
tially of three parts : an introduction, a variorum 
text, and a collection of appendices. The introduc- 
tion, which extends to 132 pages, is a historical and 
critical essay upon the fortunes of Omar in the 
modern world. It describes the various translations 
into English, French, and German, and reproduces 
many interesting passages from the writers who have 
dealt with Omar, all the way from Dr. Thomas 
Hyde (1636-1703) to Mr. John Leslie Garner of 
Milwaukee. It includes, among many other mat- 
ters of interest, Professor Cowell's paper in the 
" Calcutta Review," with its curiously cautious rec- 
ognition of Omar's genius, and its specimen quat- 
rains, to which FitzGerald was so much indebted, 
as the following will illustrate :

" Oh heart, wert thou pure from the body's dust, 
Thou should'st soar, naked spirit, alone the sky ; 
Highest heaven is thy native seat, for shame, for shame, 
That thou should'st stoop to dwell in a city of clay." 

The introduction also includes several noteworthy 
critical discussions of Omar, and the passages in 
FitzGerald's letters that relate to his own occupation 
with the Persian poet. FitzGerald's paper on Omar 
then follows, and the text of FitzGerald's second 
edition. The remaining half of the first volume 
gives us the various translations of Nicolas, Boden- 
stedt, Graf von Schack, Whinfield, Mr. Michael 
Kerney, Mr. J. H. McCarthy, Mr. J. L. Garner, 
and of FitzGerald in his first, third, and fourth edi- 
tions. All the translations of a given quatrain are 
brought together upon two pages facing each other, 
thus making easy the work of comparison. It is 
extremely interesting to note the differences between 
these versions, of which as many as ten are in the 
case of some stanzas brought together. The sec- 
ond volume of Mr. Dole's edition is wholly given 
up to appendices, which term is in this case inter- 
preted to include all manner of notes, illustrations, 
parallel passages from other poets, and bibliograph- 
ical information. It is all reading of the most de- 
lightful sort for anyone who cares for Omar, and 
our thankfulness to his editor increases with every 
page. The work is creditable to Mr. Dole's learn- 
ing, taste, and industry alike ; it would be difficult 
to improve upon it, and to most readers, who know 
their FitzGerald's Omar and nothing more, the 
bringing together of all this literature will prove 
nothing less than a revelation. 



Mr. John Bigelow's work entitled 

r The M y stei 7 of Slee p " ( Har P er ) 

is what De Quincey would have called 
Rhetoric, although the thesis which the book rec- 
ommends does not seem to fall within that singular 
category, " the immense range of truths where . . . 
the affirmative and the negative are both true." 
The thesis in question is to the effect that sleep is 
not merely a period for physical refreshment, but 
that its presumptive purpose is chiefly the admission 
of the soul to certain sacred mysteries, " for the re- 
ception of such spiritual instruction as we may be 
qualified to receive there" (p. 133). Mr. Bigelow 
does not seem desirous of establishing this point to 
a certainty ; he plays the part of De Quincey's 
rhetorician, who " exhibits his art by giving an im- 
pulse to one side, and by withdrawing the mind so 
steadily from all thoughts or images which support 
the other, as to leave it practically under the pos- 
session of a one-sided estimate." Not that we be- 
lieve that in this age of rigid scientific proof many 
minds will be left under the possession of the esti- 
mate in question ; but such is the purpose of the 
writer. Mr. Bigelow's book is practically an ampli- 
fication of the statement, "I have noted various 
things about sleep which lead me to think that it 
may be a time for spiritual growth." Where the 
affirmative is so tentatively put, there is little need 



of any negative at all. We own that our idea of 
spiritual growth is very different. We do not be- 
lieve that spiritual strength is suffused about us 
while we lie in passive torpor ; we think that it is to 
be attained only as the reward of active and vigor- 
ous exercise. But we know so little accurately of 
spiritual growth that we cannot be dogmatic as to its 
conditions, and there is so much that is uncertain 
about sleep that it is not difficult to say, Why not 
this or that connection ? One point noted by 
Mr. Bigelow is certainly significant of something . 
namely, the fact that people are apt to sleep in 
church. We think, however, that he is the first to 
detect any spiritual significance in the practise. 
Mr. Bigelow would reverse Lear's order, " I '11 
pray and then I '11 sleep," for he thinks the little nap 
comes best at the beginning (p. 95). This view 
is at least a comforting explanation of a matter 
which has heretofore been taken chiefly as a cause 
for mocking and scorn. 

The making and Pf essor N. S. Shaler, in his work 
protection of Am- entitled "American Highways" 
erican highways. (Q e ntury Co.), has presented an ac- 
count of the public roads of this country, their un- 
satisfactory condition, and the means and methods 
of their renovation. The subject is well discussed 
from its historic, economic, and engineering aspects, 
and it is well that the community should be freshly 
aroused as to its interests and duties. Within a 
few years two valuable assistants have come to the 
aid of Professor Shaler's " highwaymen "; these are 
the stone-crusher and the road-roller, both operated 
by steam. Aside from the important modifications 
in the practice of road-making which follow the use 
of these machines, little can be added to the litera- 
ture of this subject as it was developed in the early 
part of this century, and as it was taught in at least 
one American school of engineering forty years ago. 
The art of making a good road is well known, and 
is easily formulated : Grade and drain your way ; 
crush and distribute your stone, and roll it down. 
There is plenty of good road-metal in Massachusetts, 
in the form of trap, granite, and conglomerate ; 
there, the bones of old Terra protrude through the 
scanty soil in picturesque profusion, even where the 
native gravel needs no epidermal protection. But 
what can be done in the great central plain stretch- 
ing from Pennsylvania to Colorado, where areas 
much larger than Switzerland, which Professor 
Shaler refers to as a worthy example for emulation, 
are utterly destitute of rock? Or where in areas 
equally broad the only rocks are decayed limestones, 
or sandstones of even less cohesion? In America, 
the highway has lost much of its commercial con- 
sequence, and has become a luxury to be enjoyed 
by the users of the pleasure wagon, the bicycle, and 
the coming motor. Its commercial importance has 
faded under the supremacy of the railway and be- 
fore the growing distribution of the electric tram. 
It has to contend with the same silent influences 
which have banished the Conestoga wagon, the

Gossip about Peter Cunningham left -behind him 
Charles IL several works of value and several 
and his mistresses. wn i c h we re more amusing than any- 
thing else. " The Story of Nell Gwyn " (Francis 
P. Harper) is of the latter class. It has long been 
out of print, and is now republished with a sketch 
of the author's life, a few notes, and some good 
portraits. We confess to a feeling that it would 
have been quite as well to have left the book where 
it was. Antiquarians or students could always get 
at it ; and as for popular interest, we are inclined 
to think that the Restoration has declined in popular 
interest of late. Restoration plays will probably 
continue to have a value to the collector, and Pepys 
will probably never be deserted. But we suspect 
that there are now but few who care much for anec- 
dotes of Charles II. and Nell Gwyn, Moll Davis, 
Louise de Querouaille, the Countess of Castlemaine, 
and others of their kind. Mr. Cunningham notes 
as the " true apology for this story " the testimony 
of Gibber, who says that Mrs. Gwyn had less laid 
to her charge than the king's other mistresses, that 
she never dabbled in politics, that she was not un- 
faithful but had a " particular, personal inclination 
for the king." This speaks well for Mrs. Gwyn, 
but surely not so well as to make one yearn to 
know more of her. But if anyone wishes to know 
Nell Gwyn and her time fairly well without bur- 
dening the memory, we offer him the story that she 
gave the King the name of Charles III. because he 
was the successor of Charles Hart and Charles 
Sackville. 

In "The Balladists" (imported by 
Scribner) Mr. John Geddie has suc- 
ceeded very happily in a somewhat 
difficult task. Everybody knows that ballad poetry, 
although in itself a simple and popular thing, offers 
a glorious opportunity to the specialist. And although 
an old ballad may be a pure delight to the apprecia- 
tive, it may also give occasion to the most arid and 
tortuous mouthings. Mr. Geddie gives us a taste of 
his quality in his preface ; he says that instead of 
studying out the original or most authentic reading 
in any particular case, he has purposely taken that 
which best pleased his ear or clung most closely to 
his memory. Hence we have not a strictly scholarly 
treatise, but a more intimate account, written as 
much from the heart as from the intellect, and to 
the heart as well. To such a treatment almost any- 
thing may be forgiven (except ignorance or inac- 
curacy, on which points Mr. Geddie would seem to 
be quite blameless), provided only the treatment is 
successful, as is here the case. Mr. Geddie has 
made an attractive book on an attractive subject, a 
subject on which everybody has many associations 



and little information. His work, we should have 
said before, is confined to the Scotch Ballads : it 
makes a volume of the " Famous Scots " series. It 
was very well to include such a volume in the series : 
perhaps " famous " is hardly the word for the un- 
known authors of these well-known ballads, but 
although they did little for their individual fame, 
they certainly did much for the fame of their country. 

The present currency in literature of 

the ^ C tS dialect g ives a more g en ' 

eral interest to Professor William 
Hand Browne's "Early Scottish Poets" (Johns 
Hopkins Press) than it would otherwise possess. 
The book is a publication of what has long existed 
in MS. for the use of Professor Browne's classes, 
and is intended chiefly for students of Scottish lit- 
erature and dialect. It gives selections from Scotch 
poetry from Barbour to Lyndsay, with an introduc- 
tion, notes, on the poets and on the texts, and a glos- 
sary. Being practically on the same general plan as 
Zupitza's Uebungsbuch, it has, even for the student, 
the same difficulty as that excellent work, namely, 
that it pushes brevity and conciseness to such an 
extreme as to impair its usefulness a little, except in 
the hands of a competent teacher. The student of 
Middle English, however, will find the book some- 
thing of a necessity, for it is a most convenient 
basis for work, and, so far as it goes, thorough and 
accurate. The more general reader may be glad 
of an opportunity to see the practical evidences of 
Scotch literature at a time when there was a literary 
language in North Britain far more distinct than 
that which exists to-day.

on the other hand, a clear and concise statement of 
the annals of that richly endowed but unfortunate 
people. Miss Kirkland, in the latest addition to her 
series of Short Histories (McClurg), has attempted 
the latter task, and with at least fair success. The 
general reader will find in this book perhaps the 
best complete account of the events that have oc- 
curred in that peninsula whose priceless contribu- 
tions to the world's civilization make its history of 
perennial interest. Half the book is given to the 
development of national unity during the present 
century, and this part is by far the most interesting 
because of its greater fulness.

measured, weighed, and their properties ascertained, 
are explained to the intelligent lay reader as well 
as to the trained chemist. Two subjects receive 
especial attention. The first is the almost forgotten 
phlogiston, which, like the inter-planetary ether of 
to-day, was only a creation of the philosophic imag- 
ination, devised to explain difficulties otherwise 
apparently insoluble. For a century the ideal phlo- 
giston was a stumbling-stone in the path of chem- 
ical discovery, which vanished only when chemistry 
was subjected to accurate experimentation, chas- 
tened by mathematical methods. The other topic is 
the discovery and accurate determination of argon, 
the latest-found constituent of the air.

have recently received two editions of " The Princess," 
one edited by Professor Woodberry (Longmans), the 
other by Mr. A. J. George (Heath). In the "Athenseum 
Press Series " (Ginn), we have " Sartor Resartus," 
edited by Professor Archibald MacMechan, and a vol- 
ume of selections from Steele, edited by Professor G. R. 
Carpenter. The same publishers put forth Spenser's 
" Britomart," a volume of passages from the " Faery 
Queene," edited by Miss Mary E. Litchfield. In the 
" Riverside Literature Series " (Houghton), we have 
four scattered books of Pope's " Iliad," and Burke's 
speech on " Conciliation," the latter edited by Mr. 
Robert Anderson. We get a good deal more of Burke 
in the volume of " Selections " made by Professor Bliss 
Perry for Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., as good a book of 
its sort as one could wish. Finally, the American Book 
Co. publish Carlyle's essay on Burns in a small volume, 
with a few notes. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a new and extended edi- 
tion of the admirable " Physiology for Beginners " that 
we owe to the collaboration of Professor Foster and 
Dr. L. E. Shore. The same publishers send us a 
" Hygiene for Beginners," by Dr. Ernest S. Reynolds. 
Messrs. Hinds and Noble publish in their " University 



Tutorial Series " a text-book of " The Tutorial Chem- 
istry, Part I.," by Messrs. G. H. Bailey and W. Briggs. 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish the " Outlines of 
Electricity and Magnetism," a clear and logical treatise 
by Professor Charles A. Perkins. 

Some fifty pages of Robinsons usher in the new vol- 
ume (the forty-ninth) of the " Dictionary of National 
Biography" (Macmillan), and some fifty pages of 
Russells stand guard at the end. The greatest literary 
name included is that of the Rossettis, of whom Dr. 
Richard Garnett writes with knowledge and sympathy. 
George Romney is the subject of another important 
article. Mr. C. H. Firth's account of Prince Rupert is 
the longest biography included in this volume. 

A number of German text-books have recently been 
published. The American Book Co. have a " First Year 
in German," by Professor I. Keller, and Storm's " Im- 
mensee," edited by Mr. F. A. Dauer. Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. send us "Kopnicker Strasse 120," by 
Herren Moser and Heiden, edited by Professor B. W. 
Wells; and Goethe's "Iphigenie auf Tauris," edited 
by Professor Lewis A. Rhoades. Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
publish a volume of " Tales from Hauff," edited by Pro- 
fessor Charles B. Goold. Last of all, a selection of 
" German Scientific Reading," made by Professors 
H. C. G. Brandt and W. C. Day, comes to us from 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

"The Earth and Its Story," by Professor Angelo 
Heilprin, is a " first book of geology " published by 
Messrs. Silver, Burdett, & Co. It is a very elementary 
treatise, highly readable, and provided with satisfactory 
illustrations. The American Book Co. publish an " Ele- 
mentary Meteorology," by Dr. Frank Waldo, designed 
for high schools and colleges. The suggestions of the 
Committee of Ten have been taken as the basis of this 
work. " Problems in Elementary Physics," by Mr. 
E. Dana Pierce, comes from Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a " Laboratory Manual of 
Inorganic Chemistry," by Mr. Rufus P. Williams; and 
a handbook of " Inorganic Chemical Preparations," by 
Dr. Frank Hall Thorp. Both of these books are ad- 
mirably planned for high school use. 

Mr. Andrew J. George has just published a school 
volume of " Select Poems of Robert Burns " (Heath), 
putting to good account his long experience as a teacher 
and as an editor of annotated texts. He gives us a 
careful preface, over two hundred pages of the poems 
and something like a hundred pages of notes. He 
makes extensive use of brief extracts from those writers 
who have dealt critically with Burns, wherein he does 
wisely, for such extracts are of great value to students. 
The note of enthusiasm for his subject is possibly a 
little strained, but few writers who take up Burns for 
criticism quite keep their balance, and Mr. George errs 
in good company. 

Professor Edward B. Poulton, of Oxford, England, 
issues in the " Century Science Series " (Macmillan) an 
account of Charles Darwin and the Theory of Natural 
Selection, which is a model of clearness and brevity. It 
is at once a memoir of Darwin, a lucid statement of the 
theory which bears his name, and a history of the pro- 
cesses by which the theory was evolved. The elements 
of power are portrayed that won, almost against their 
will, the support of Lyell and Huxley, Hooker and Asa 
Gray, and within less than twoscore years have assured 
the world- wide recognition of Darwin as one of the fore- 
most discoverers of the closing century.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. announce a series of " Lives 
of the Great Explorers," by well-known writers. 

The long-expected critical study of Shakespeare by 
Dr. Georg Brandes, in Mr. Archer's translation, is again 
announced for early publication by the Macmillan Co. 

" The Story of Extinct Civilizations of the East," by 
Mr. Robert E. Anderson, is published by Messrs. 
D. Appleton & Co. in their " Library of Useful Stories." 

The " Cambridge " Lowell is to be published imme- 
diately by Messrs. Houghton, Mil'llin & Co. It will 
present all the poems in a single volume, uniform with 
the " Cambridge " Longfellow, Whittier, and Holmes. 

The Macmillan Co. publish Maria Edgeworth's " Be- 
linda," with an Introduction by Mrs. Anne Thackeray 
Ritchie and illustrations by Miss Chris Hammond, in 
their handsome series of " Illustrated Standard Novels." 

" St. Ives," the last up to date of Stevenson's 
posthumous works, will begin as a serial in the March 
number of " McClure's Magazine." It is a love-story 
and tale of adventure, left " all but complete " at Stev- 
enson's death. 

" The Chronicles," edited by Professor R. G. Moulton, 
is published by the Macmillan Co. in " The Modern 
Reader's Bible." The same publishers send us Jonson's 
" Every Man in his Humour," in the pretty series of 
" Temple Dramatists." 

A thoroughly revised edition of Lanier's " The En- 
glish Novel," printed from new plates and including 
several passages that have not been printed before, is 
now published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Mrs. 
Lanier has prepared this edition for the press. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have in press a new and 
revised edition of Gary's version of Dante's " Divina 
Commedia," together with Rossetti's translation of the 
" Vita Nuova," edited by Professor L. Oscar Kuhns of 
Wesleyan University, with explanatory notes and intro- 
duction. The work will be illustrated. 

A series of volumes made up entirely from the origi- 
nal sources of American history is announced by the 
Macmillan Co., under the general title " American His- 
tory told by Contemporaries " and the editorship of 
Professor A. B. Hart. The initial volume, "Era of 
Colonization 1492 to 1689," is promised for April. 

The first number of " The Expositor," the new theo- 
logical monthly published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., 
has just reached us. Dr. Robertson Nicoll is the En- 
glish editor, and his American associate is Dr. Charles 
Cuthbert Hall. The magazine is attractive in appear- 
ance, and contains a variety of articles some popular 
and some purely scholarly by well-known writers. 

A correspondent writes us that Mr. Aldrich's poem of 
" Judith and Holofernes," reviewed in the last issue of 
THE DIAL, is incorrectly spoken of as " new." The 
poem is new in its present form and under its present 
title, some lyrical interludes, etc., constituting about 
a hundred and twenty out of its thousand lines, as stated 
in the author's introduction, having been printed about 
ten years ago under the title " Judith." 

We have heretofore refrained from mentioning the 
great cooperative work upon modern history planned by 
Lord Acton, because only the vaguest announcements of 
the project have reached us until recently. It seems, 
however, that preparation of the work is assured, that it 
will extend to twelve volumes, and that it will be called 



" The Cambridge Modern History." The first volume, 
dealing with the Renaissance, will probably be ready in 
two or three years. 

The authorities at Harvard are gradually increasing 
the courses offered in their Summer School, and widen- 
ing the scope of the instruction. During the early years 
of the school's existence, only a few elementary courses 
in science were taught, but the list of courses to be given 
in 1897 contains the names of thirty-four courses in arts 
and sciences, embracing almost all the subjects taught 
at the university. Modern languages are represented, 
as well as the classics, history and civil government, 
psychology, pedagogy, mathematics, topographical sur- 
veying, and the whole range of sciences. 

Dr. Elliott Coues has been engaged upon, and Mr. 
Francis P. Harper is to publish, " The Journals of 
Alexander Henry the Younger, and David Thompson," 
an important work of exploration of the West in the 
early years of this century. Dr. Coues writes of the 
author of this work in the following terms: " Henry was 
a fur trader among the Indians, and a partner in the 
Northwest Fur Company. His daily Journal opens in 
1799, and ends with his death in 1814. He was a 
remarkable man a keen observer and accurate re- 
corder, and preeminately a man of veracity in the writ- 
ing of his Journal, concealing nothing, not even palliat- 
ing anything. His diary may be compared with that of 
Samuel Pepys in many respects. It throws a flood of 
new light on the actual life of those hardy ' Northmen ' 
without artificial coloring or sentimental romanticism. 
The stirring incidents and clear-cut picture of life in 
the wilderness holds the reader's attention from begin- 
ning to end. As a piece of contemporaneous history it 
is simply invaluable. Nothing like it exists either in 
print or in manuscript."

the Rio Grande Western Railway " Great Salt Lake Route " 
for his route to the Pacific Coast. It is the only transconti- 
nental line passing directly through Salt Lake City, and in 
addition to the glimpse it affords to the Temple City, the

it offers the choice of three distinct routes through the moun- 
tains and the most magnificent scenery in the world. On all 
Pacific Coast tourist tickets stop-overs are granted at Denver, 
Colorado Springs, Manitou, Leadville, Glenwood Springs, Salt 
Lake City, Ogden, and other points of interest. Double daily 
train service and through Pullman and Tourist sleeping cars

NEW BOOKS. 

TELEPATHY AND THE SUBLIMINAL SELF. 

Hypnotism, Automatism. Dreams, Phantasms, and Related 
Phenomena. By Dr. R. OSGOOD MASON. With a copy of 
a portrait made while in a trance by a person who had never 
painted before. 12mo, $1.50. 

A book accurate enough for scientists and simple enough for lovers 
of " ghost stories." On a thread of theory and discussion, Dr. Mason 
links many startling examples from his own professional experience and 
from the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. 

A DIPLOMAT IN LONDON. 

Letters and Notes (1871-1877). Translated from the French 

of CHAKLES GAVARD. 12mo, $1.25. 

M. Gavard left Paris in 1871, just before the entry of the Prussians. 
He was in the French Legation to the Court of St. James for seven years. 
He took part in many "functions " and visited many great houses, and 
his account of the every-day life of the English aristocracy is most inti- 
mate, and brightened by humor and satire. He also met, among others, 
the Rothschilds, Gounod, the Empress of Germany, and the Czar. He 
writes much on Bismarck. He describes a meet, many receptions, 
dinners, and balls, the theatres, the slums, a sham battle, a great fire, 
the dissolution of Parliament, the review of the troops from Ashantee, 
Livingston's funeral, etc.

A REMARKABLE TRIBUTE 

TO A REMARKABLE BOOK. 



Professor PAULSEN of the University of Berlin, in the 
course of an extended review in the Deutsche Littera- 
turzeitung, says of 

FRANCKE'S SOCIAL FORCES IN 
GERMAN LITERATURE 

" / have not read any other History of Literature which 
so strongly inclined me to take up the authors myself. It is 
neither a dry summary nor a wearisome attempt to include 
every possible fact, nor does it abound in affected literary 
criticisms, or historical reflections about matters of course, 
but it puts the reader in the centre of the vital movements 
of the time. One often feels as though the authors treated 
of addressed themselves personally to him ; the discourse 
coming not through bygone dead books, but rather through 
living men. 

" The literary characterizations are not merely shadowy 
outlines of types or tendencies, but set men and their works 
in their concrete peculiarities clearly before our eyes, and 
in an extraordinarily lifelike way. The author has a great 
faculty for selecting characteristic extracts from the writers 
he treats of a poem, a word, an opinion to give his pic- 
ture life and motion."

$1000.J FOR A STORY 



Desiring to secnre a religious story of superior 
merit, we offer ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
in Cash for the best MS. submitted to us before 
September 1, 1897, and FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS for the second best MS., each to be from sixty thousand to sixty-five 
thousand words in length. 

PURPOSE OF THE BOOK. It is customary for Sunday-school teachers and officers to make gifts to their scholars at 
the Christmas season. This Company aims each year to take advantage of this by offering them, for the purpose, a book of 
superior attractiveness and merit one that will be unrivalled as a gift, and which will prove a powerful factor in elevating 
and moulding the heart and life of the reader. Of " Titus,'' 
our Christmas book for 1894, there have now been sold nearly 
one million copies. " The Wrestler of Philippi," published for 
the holidays of 1896, has had a very large sale. The $1000.00 book accepted we shall bring out for 1897. The $500.00 book, 
if one of sufficient merit is secured, will be published for the season of 1898. The book should help the reader to the best 
conception of this life and true living of it. It will be judged upon its literary merits and forcefulness for this purpose. The 
widest liberty will be given writers as to plot. 

THE PLAN. Each MS. will be given a number. A receipt will be sent to the author, stating the number assigned. All 
MSS. will be submitted (without authors' names) to three competent judges. Judges will not be asked to examine MS. written 
in pencil or otherwise improperly prepared. Payment will be made for the best two books received, without reserve, on com- 
pletion of examination, and not later than October 30, 1897. 

WHY UNDERTAKE WRITING. There is seldom such an opportunity offered a writer for both usefulness and gaining 
a wider reputation. Few religious story books reach a sale of more than five or six thousand. We can insure a sale of at least 
half a million. With such an incentive and purpose you should find greater inspiration in writing. If your book is not con- 
sidered the best, or second best, you will still have as good a chance as otherwise of selling it to some other publisher and 
most books are written and a publisher afterwards sought. For circular giving further particulars, address 

Book Department, DAVID C. COOK PUBLISHING CO., 36 Washington St., Chicago. 



LIBRARIES. 

WE solicit correspondence with book-buyers for private and 
other Libraries, and desire to submit figures on proposed lists.

THE LIFE OF A FOX. By THOMAS SMITH (Master of the

JALLAND. 

This volume contains both of Smith's published works, "The Life of 
a Fox " and " Extracts from the Diary of a Huntsman." The author's 
reputation as a huntsman, as well as his gift of literary expression and 
his skill as a spirited draughtsman, made these books exceedingly pop-

and Great Part of the Highlands of Scotland. By Colonel

Colored Plates by G. E. LODGE. 

This work, published in 1804, and reviewed hi the following year by 
SIR WALTEK SCOTT for the Edinburgh Review, has never been reprinted. 
It is extremely interesting, not only on account of the graphic descrip- 
tions of shooting, hawking, and angling, but because of the author's 
shrewd observations on the state of society and manners, and his sym- 
pathetic description of scenery.

THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN THE 

REIGN OF HENRY 111., 
And Its Culmination in the Barons' War. 

By OLIVER H. RICHARDSON, 

Professor of History in Drury College, Missouri. Just Beady. 
This brief history, based upon careful research and abounding in 
citations from original authorities, is designed for a student's book of 
reference, but will interest the reading public by its broad treatment 
and popular literary style. It aims to portray, first, those movements 
which tended to denationalize England by perversion of her constitution 
through the influence of the political doctrines of thirteenth century 
France and the Empire Church ; and, second, those counter-movements, 
which at length resulted in the establishment of a national and popular 
constitution. 



THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 
A Commentary on its Nature and Growth. 

By JESSE MACT, M.A., 
Professor of Political Science in Iowa College. 

Cloth, $2.00 net. 

The book has grown out of an effort to make American 
readers understand the present English government. The 
first part makes an excellent introduction to Bryce's American 
Commonwealth, as supplying the knowledge of English polit- 
ical institutions which Mr. Bryce presupposes and which his 
English readers possess. The second part shows how the 
present Constitution has been derived from English history. 



IMPORTANT WORKS ON ROCKS AND THE SOIL, GEOLOGY, ETC. 



ROCKS, ROCK- WEATHERING AND SOILS. 

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, Curator of Geology United States 

National Museum and Professor of Geology in the Corcoran 

Scientific School and Graduate School of the Columbian 

University, Washington, D. C. With many illustrations, 

full- page plates, and figures in the text. Just Ready. 

This book treats of the origin, composition, and structure of the 

rocks composing the earth's crust, the manner of their weathering, the 

causes that lead thereto, and finally of the petrographic nature of the 

Sroduct of this breaking down. The work differs from any published 
ere or in England in its full discussion of the principles of weathering 
and its geological effects. Much of the matter given has never before 
appeared in print. It will serve as a work of reference, as a text-book 
for students in agricultural colleges, etc., while its ample illustration 
renders it attractive to any teacher or student interested in geology.

A companion to the " Elementary Physical Geography " by the same 
author which has been so widely used duting the past year. The High 
Schools of Chicago and many others of high grade adopted it as soon 
after its publication as possible. A course in science which should com- 
bine these two books would be of great value.

MEMOIRS OF MARSHAL OUDINOT, 

Due de Reggio. Compiled from the hitherto unpublished 
souvenirs of the Duchess de Reggio by GASTON STIEGLER, 
and now first translated into English by ALEXANDER TEIX- 
KIKA DE MATTOS. With 2 Portraits in Heliogravure. 12mo, 
cloth. 

The marshal's wife was much with her husband in the field, 
accompanying him, for instance, during the retreat from Mos- 
cow. Of that she gives a very graphic description; and, 
indeed, she draws vivid pictures of all that stirring epoch. 
The book takes in the Revolution, the Directory, Napoleon's 
ascendency, the Restoration, and comes up to about 1830. It 
has photographs of the marshal and his wife, who in the end, 
of course, threw in their lot with the Bourbons. 

THE TRUE LIFE OF 
CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD F. BURTON. 

Written by his niece, QEORGIANA M. STISTED, with the au- 
thority and approval of the Burton family. 12mo, cloth, 
with portrait, $2.00. 

Few men have had careers so full of romantic interest, 
change, and adventure as that of Sir Richard Burton. The 
object of the author of this memoir has been " first to tell the 
truth, secondly to supply a want often complained of the 
story of the great traveller's life in a popular form." The re- 
sult is a notable and welcome addition to biographical litera- 
ture. As an English critic has remarked, " there have been 
few better romances ever written." 

THE EARLY CORRESPONDENCE OF 
HANS VON BULOW. 

Edited by his Widow. Selected and translated by CONSTANCE 
BACHE. With Portraits. 8vo, cloth, $4.50. 
These letters contain graphic descriptions of the trials of a 
young musician, and much interesting gossip about Liszt and 
Wagner, to whose encouragement Von Billow owed so much in

precocious talents in other directions than music, and the bio-

Romans," etc. A new volume in the Criminology Series. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In this volume Mr. Morrison deals with the extent and char- 
acter of juvenile crime. He shows the effect of sex and age 
on criminal tendencies, and describes the geographical distri- 
bution of the juvenile criminal population. Mr. Morrison has 
a vast amount of personal experience behind him, and his work 
derives additional interest from the fact that he is dealing with 
a subject which he knows at first hand.

interested in the development of the art of historical composition, of 
all who wish to see a fresh spirit and fresh methods applied to the writ- 
ing of American history. He has not only made an excellent contribu- 
tion to culture history, but he has reached a vantage-ground of broad 
and free observation which few of his predecessors has so much as dis- 
cerned and which subsequent historians must strive to attain if they 
have any consideration of their fame." Prof. W. P. TRENT, in the

" The spirit and method of Kipling's fresh and virile song have taken 
the English reading world. . . . When we turn to the larger portion of 
'The Seven Seas,' how imaginative it is, how impassioned, how su- 
perbly rhythmic and sonorous ! . . . The ring and diction of this verse 
add new elements to our song. . . . The true laureate of Greater Brit- 
ain." E. C. STEDMAN, in The Book Buyer.

TATTERLEY. 

The Story of a Dead Man. By T. GALLON. 
This curious and striking story takes the reader out of the 
beaten track of current fiction, and any prototype which is 
suggested belongs to an earlier time. The book will be found 
intensely interesting, very vivid in its pictures of avarice and 
love, the meaner passions and the noblest sentiments, and 
American readers are likely to join English critics in predict- 
ing a brilliant future for this new and talented writer. 

ARRESTED. 

By ESME STUART, author of "A Woman of Forty," etc. 

This entertaining and gracefully written story will take its 
place among the most interesting novels of the day. It will 
be read with pleasure, and unhesitatingly recommended by 
the reader. 

THE CAREER OF CANDIDA. 

By GEORGE PASTON, author of " A Study of Prejudices," etc. 

"A really interesting book." London Daily Chronicle. 

"One of the most robust and refreshing stories of the year. It 
tackles more than one thorny social problem with admirable courage, 
and challenges Mrs. Grundy to mortal encounter, but there is not the 
least verbal offence in it, not even to the most priggish and prudish of 
novel readers." London Daily Telegraph.

THE RE VAL UA TION OF LITER A TURE. 

Two recent numbers of " The Atlantic 
Monthly " have included in their contents an 
essay well calculated to startle the readers, es- 
pecially the older readers, of that conservative 
magazine. The essay in question is from the pen 
of a new writer, and is nothing less than a frank 
revaluation of the work of Emerson. Discard- 
ing, as far as possible, all traditional judgments, 
the attempt is made to estimate, from the 
broader because more cosmopolitan standpoint 
of these latter days, and in the light of a fuller 
knowledge than was in the possession of an 
earlier generation, the value of Emerson's con- 
tribution to American thought and American 
literature. Some of the conclusions reached 
by the critic are so far at variance with those 
that have long been seemingly crystallized in 
the histories of our literature that one rubs his 
eyes at the iconoclastic utterances, and wonders 
if anything is sacred to these daring young men 
who are so busily engaged in bringing us new 
lamps to exchange for our old ones. It is not 
that the essay betrays animus, or is in any offen- 
sive sense an attack upon a great and cherished 
reputation, but rather that its writer has set 
about a de novo exposition, and has freed him- 
self from the trammels of the conventional 
phrase and the conventional attitude. When 
we remember the indignation aroused in certain 
quarters less than fifteen years ago by the very 
qualified and cautious strictures of Matthew 
Arnold upon our beloved philosopher of the 
transcendental, it is a noteworthy sign of the 
times that the indigenous " Atlantic " should 
open its pages to an estimate of Emerson com- 
pared with which the Arnold essay marks almost 
the extreme of laudatory and reverent handling. 
It is not our present intention to examine 
this newest interpretation of Emerson, or even 
to express any very decided opinion upon its 
fairness, either in detail or as a whole. We 
doubt, indeed, if Emerson's warmest devotees 
in the past have ever given full expression to- 
their real thought, or at least to the whole of 
their thought, upon the subject. Their pane- 
gyric must have been accompanied by some 
mental reservations, for upon certain sides Em- 
erson's mind was curiously limited, and in very 
obvious ways. But we may profitably seize the 



138 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



occasion for the purpose of a few reflections 
upon the provisional character of all contem- 
poraneous literary judgments, and upon the 
necessity of such revaluations as the one now 
in question, before anything like finality can be 
hoped for. Can we never know, one is apt to 
cry somewhat despairingly, can we never really 
know whether the men of our own time, who so 
tower above the crowd, and to whom we bring 
the incense of our hero worship, are in fact 
men of stature fit to stand among the chosen of 
history ? We can see that they are taller than 
the men about them, and can we not get their 
figures in such perspective with the figures of 
other generations that we may know how they 
will stand in the retrospective view of our de- 
scendants ? Such questions as these are con- 
stantly arising in critical minds strenuous after 
absolute truth, and the attempt to answer them 
in the affirmative is as constantly baffled. 

Yet there are ways, if one will but seek them, 
in which our judgment of the men living in our 
midst may be in a measure purified and brought 
into rough conformity with the judgments that 
will be recorded by posterity. If we would 
escape from the error of the personal equation, 
we may do so in part by cultivating a tolerance 
of opinions not our own ; if the national or 
racial equation be (as it nearly always is) a 
source of error, we may largely eliminate it by 
consulting the judgment of intelligent men of 
other nations and races. But if we adopt the 
chauvinistic attitude in such matters, our case 
is quite hopeless. If we call all rational and 
balanced criticism that comes from abroad mere 
" condescension in foreigners," if, what is 
worse still, we reply to every adverse English or 
Continental comment with a childish tu quoque, 
we simply wrap ourselves up, head and all, 
in the mantle of provincialism, and barter our 
critical birthright for a little applause from the 
meaner spirits of our own day and our own 
Little Pedlington. There is more truth than is 
commonly realized in the saying that we may 
find a sort of contemporaneous posterity in for- 
eign opinion. Then, to approach the problem 
from another point of view, we find that in 
nearly all the cases in which some great writer 
has been ignored by contemporary opinion, 
there have not been lacking in his own time a 
few clear-sighted critics who have discerned the 
true quality of the neglected genius. Preach- 
ing to deaf ears in their own generation, these 
critics have found honor in the next, and shared 
in the posthumous praise that has come to the 
poets who got scant praise while they were 



alive. It may usually be found that in such 
unheeded utterances there is a note of convic- 
tion, a sense of absolute certainty that time will 
prove them to have been right. When we come 
upon such judgments, and realize, with our bet- 
ter light, how well-founded they were, we find it 
almost impossible to understand how they could 
have spent their force unechoed. We also learn 
that a genuine critical idea, however long may 
be the period of its gestation, emerges into 
active life in the end. Nothing could be more 
instructive for us, if we would escape the tyr- 
anny of the " subjective criticism " that so colors 
and distorts the popular judgments of every 
period, than a careful study of the thought of 
those men of the past whose intellectual habit 
has enabled them to anticipate the verdict of 
posterity ; nothing could be more helpful than 
the endeavor to acquire something of their tem- 
per, and to transfer our standards to their ob- 
jective plane. 

In our age, however, the question which con- 
fronts us is the question of deciding upon rel- 
ative values rather than that of discovering 
neglected genius. There are so many voices 
to-day, and so many organs of opinion, so strong 
a determination to let no new talent bud unde- 
tected, and so intricate a critical apparatus for 
the exploitation of every new literary develop- 
ment, that the world is far less likely than for- 
merly to pass the strong man by, and the real 
critical danger lies ia what has been wittily de- 
scribed as the " cygnification of geese." But 
time may be trusted to set these false classifi- 
cations right, and that very speedily ; while we 
may with equal confidence depend upon that 
potent agency for the readjustments and the 
regroupings that determine for the reputations 
of the hour their final stations in the pantheon 
of fame. 

The day seems to have come to attempt some 
such readjustment of the positions of our older 
American writers, and the essay which has fur- 
nished us with our text is in this respect timely. 
Its very title reminds us that it is now sixty 
years since the traditional estimate of Emerson 
was given shape, and sixty years means two 
generations. One who follows the deeper cur- 
rents of opinion can hardly fail to have ob- 
served that recent years have placed us in a 
more critical attitude toward the great men of 
our literary past, and that the old unquestioning 
acceptance has given place to a more searching 
and objective examination of their quality. As 
a result of this development of our critical 
temper, some men have gained and others have

lost. Lowell and Whittier have, we should say, 
gained distinctly ; and Hawthorne (considering 
his finest work) has still better stood the test 
of time. On the other hand, Emerson, consid- 
ering the fetichism of which he was long made 
the subject in certain quarters, could hardly 
fail to lose, just as Longfellow and Bryant 
have lost. The friends of Lanier have almost 
made good his title to a place among our major 
poets, while the friends of Parkman have been 
quite successful in securing for him the highest 
rank among our historians. As for the two 
men of genius at whose names American opin- 
ion has long looked askance, while European 
opinion has been lecturing us in clamorous 
fashion upon their greatness, we must say that 
the critical issue is still uncertain, with the 
odds rather in favor of Poe and rather against 
Whitman. But in these two cases, feeling is 
probably even yet too strong for judgment, and 
we shall have to wait until we get into some 
future generation " where beyond these voices 
there is peace " before we shall know the defi- 
nite status of either our enfant terrible or our 
"good gray poet." For one feature of the 
critical reconstruction now in full swing we 
may all be devoutly thankful, and that is the 
growing tendency to break down the artificial 
barrier between American and " British " lit- 
erature, the growing realization of the fact 
that, as men of essentially one blood and one 
speech, Englishmen and Americans are at work 
in the production of a common literature. De- 
spite the occasional mouthings of literary jin- 
goes upon both sides of the Atlantic, the lesson 
is now fairly well learned that the standards by 
which we judge a Tennyson and a Wordsworth 
must be the same as the standards by which we 
estimate the worth of a Lowell or an Emerson. 



DIALECTAL SURVIVALS FROM 
CHAUCER. 

In a former number of THE DIAL (Jan. 16, 1894) 
the writer took occasion to point out several dia- 
lectal forms which have survived from the English 
of Spenser's time, citing examples from Spenser in 
each case. Recently, in reading the complete works 
of Chaucer, notes were made of striking forms. It 
must, however, be remembered that in reading 
Chaucer one is often too much absorbed in the story 
to think of philology or to make notes. It is not 
supposed, then, that this list is complete. Taking 
the year 1390 as near the middle of Chaucer's 
period of fruitfulness, we thus go back to a time 
two hundred years before the publication of " The 



Faery Queene," the period represented in the former 
article. 

Some of these forms occurring in Chaucer such 
as aferd, contrarie, fift, sixt, pore were discussed 
in the preceding paper relating to Spenser, and will 
receive no further notice here. 

Again is often used in dialect as a preposition 
instead of against. This usage is not uncommon in 
Chaucer and in Middle English. 

" Which is agayu your I awes reverence." 

(Pr. T., 112.) 

Marlowe's "Edward II." (printed 1598) furnishes 
the following example : 

" Libels are cast again thee in the street." 
So agains, another form of the same word, still 
common, occurs in Chaucer. The following quota- 
tion (Ph. T., 180-3) contains both forms: 
" How that a knight, called Virginias, 
Agayns the lawe, agayn al equitee, 
Holdeth, expres agayn the wil of me, 
My servant, which that is my thral by right." 

Axe for ask is still common among ignorant 
people. It has an unbroken history from Anglo- 
Saxon days down to the present time. The Anglo- 
Saxon verb is acsian and axian as well as ascian. 
In Layamon's " Brut," lines 8217-8, we have 
" Yif her is seni cniht 

The of Eueline axeth riht." 
Langland's " Piers the Plowman," IV., 103, reads : 

" For Mede hath made me amendes ; I may namore axe." 

The Wycliffe Bible employs the form often, as for 

example in Matthew II., 8, " Go ye, and axe ye 

bisili of the child." Examples abound in Chaucer : 

" And for my work right no- thing wol I axe." 

(PA. T., 24.) 

A later example is : " My lady axes you, when you 
will take possession of your house." (" Three Ladies 
of London," printed 1584.) This word is no longer 
in good use, bat is still heard in both England and 
America. 

Bad was formerly compared bad, badder, baddest. 
For an example of the comparative, see Chaucer's 
" Squieres Tale," line 224 : 

" They demen gladly to the badder ende." 
For an example of later date (about 1664) see 
Henry More's " Mystery of Iniquity," " It will bring 
in a Principle of badder consequence." I do not 
remember to have heard badder used otherwise than 
humorously. 

Fer of the Middle English (Mod. Eng./ar), used 
both adjectively and adverbially, may be mentioned 
here as the ancestor of our fur, careless pronuncia- 
tion for far. In the following it is used as an ad- 
jective : 

" Fer ben thy freendes at thy grete nede I " 

(M. ofL. T., 560.) 

and in the following as an adverb : 

" Til finally she gan so fer espye." 

(Pr. T., 139.) 

It is compared fer, ferre, ferreste. An example of 
the superlative from Chaucer is : 

"The ferreste in his parissh, muche and lyte." 

(Prol., 494.) 



140 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



For to with the infinitive is common in Chaucer : 
" Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, 
And palmers for to seken straunge strondes." 

(Pro/. 12, 13.) 
Compare " Hamlet," III., I., 175 : 

" Which for to prevent, 
I have in quick determination 
Thus set it down." 

and the King James Bible, " What went ye out for 
to see?" retained in the Revised Version. The 
refrain in "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," is 

" Coming for to carry me home." 
Gret for great is a mispronunciation sometimes 
heard. Compare Chaucer : 

" And therfor god gret wreche upon him sente." 

(Monkes T., 223.) 
" A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was." 

(Pro/., 197.) 
" Her gretteste ooth was but by seynt Loy." 

(Pro/., 120.) 

The use of guess in the sense of suppose, think, 
judge, is now considered objectionable. This was 
the usual meaning of the word in Chaucer's time : 
" Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse." 

(Pro/., 82.) 

and it retained this meaning down to a recent date. 
Here is an example from Sheridan's " School for 
Scandal," III., II.: " Well, then, Mr. Trip, you have 
a pleasant sort of place here, I guess ? " 

He is used as a substantive in the following pas- 

" And nat so sone departed nas 
That he fro him." (H. of F., 2068-9. ) 

As also in Shakespeare ; for example : 
" 111 bring my action on the proudest he 
That stops my way in Padua." 

(T. of the S., III., 1L, 236.) 

The evolution of the meaning of heap is interest- 
ing. In Anglo-Saxon it meant a multitude, crowd, 
as in " Elene," 549 : 

" Tha cwom thegna heap 
To tham heremethle." 
[Then came a multitude of men (a heap of thanes) to the 

people's assembly.] 
In Chaucer (Prol., 575) we have 

" The wisdom of an heep of learned men," 
and in Shakespeare (King H. V., IV., V., 18): 
"Let us in heaps go offer up our lives 

[Unto these English, or else die with fame.] " 
Later we find the meanings of a great many, a large 
number, a large quantity ; and at present a pile, a 
mass. Colloquially the word has at present the 
meaning a great many, great deal, much. It is even 
said to be a synonym for very, but I have never 
heard it in that sense. 

Holp, used as past tense and past participle of 
help, is from the Anglo-Saxon holpen, past participle 
of the verb helpen. From the past participle it 
came to be used as the past tense also. 
" Now voucheth sauf that I may you devyse 
How that I may been holpe and in what wyse." 

(Frk. T., 315-6.) 
It occurs not infrequently in Shakespeare : 

" Let him thank me that holp to send him thither." 
(Rich. III., I., II., 107.) 



And so in modern dialect ; for example, " Brer B'ar, 
he holp Miss Meadows bring the wood " (" Uncle 
Remus," 112). Tennyson uses the form several 
times, as in " Guinevere," 45 : 

" So Sir Lancelot holp 

To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice 
Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went." 
The I is omitted as I have heard the word pro- 
nounced, that is, it is pronounced exactly as hope. 
I have even heard help called hep. 

Learn is used once in Chaucer for teach. See 
" The Chanouns Yemannes Tale," line 195 : 

" Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk," 
that is, taught by a clerk. It was more frequently 
so used by Shakespeare : 

" Come, civil night, 

Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, 
And learn me how to lose a winning match." 

(B.andJ., III., II., 12.) 
The mistake is common enough now. 

Lever (comparative of lief, A.-S., leofj was fre- 
quently used by Chaucer : 

" He hadde lever him-self to mordre and dye 
Than that men shulde a lover him espye." 

(L.ofG. W., 1536-7.) 

The following example is from Spenser (F. Q., L, 
IX., 32, 9) : 

" For lever had I die then see his deadly face." 
In late English rather with had has taken the place 
of lever. I am not sure that I have heard the form 
used other than humorously. Tennyson often em- 
ploys the form liefer ; for example : 

" Far liefer by his dear hand had I die." 

(G. and Jff.,68.) 

Set is often confused in modern English with sit. 
In Chaucerian English seten was the past participle 
of sitten. Compare " Legend of Good Women," 
1109: 

"And with the queene whan that he had sete." 
Langland uses the form in the past tense (P. P., 
XIII., 98) : 

" And I sete stille, as pacience seyde." 
Squire is a square, a carpenter's tool, in the fol- 
lowing quotation : 

" Now, Thomas, leve brother, lef thyn ire ; 
Thou shalt me finde as just as is a squire." 

(Som. T., 381-2.) 

And in Spenser's " Faery Queene," II., L, 58, 1-2 : 
" ' But Temperaunce,' said he, ' with golden squire 
Betwixt them both can measure out a meane.' " 
And in Shakespeare's " Winter's Tale," IV., IV., 
348: 

" One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced 
before the king ; and not the worst of the three, but jumps 
twelve foot and a half by the squire." 
I have heard the instrument so called. 

One sometimes hears sistren from ignorant peo- 
ple, especially in connection with brethren, " brethren 
and sistren." Compare Langland (P. P., V., 627 ) : 
" And there aren sevene sustren that serven treuthe evere." 
And Chaucer (H. of F., 1401) : 

" And hir eiglite sustren eke, 
That in hir face semen meke." 

Tother (the tother that other) was not uncom- 
mon in Middle English: 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



141 



" He shal not rightfully his yre wreke 
Or he have herd the tother party speke." 

(L.ofG. W., 324-5). 

" But if ony smyte thee in the right cheke, schewe to him 
also the tothir." (Wycliffe, Mat., V., 39.) 

Whatsomever is found in the " Romaunt of the 
Rose," line 5041 (the authorship need not concern 
us here) : 

" But what-som-ever wo they fele, 
They wol not pleyne, but concele." 

Compare James VI. of Scotland (afterwards James 
I. of England), " Revlis and Cavtelis of Sc. Poesie," 
III.: 

" And finally, quhatsumever be zour subject, to use vocabula 
artis, quhairby ze may the mair vivelie represent that per- 
soun, quhais pairt ze paint out." 

The following example is from " Uncle Remus," 64 : 
" Brer Rabbit aint see no peace w'atsomever." 

Wrastle is old. Compare Layamon (Brut, 
1871-2) : 

" Ther wes muchel folc 
At there wrastlinge." 

And Chaucer (Prol, 547-8) : 

" That proved wel, for over-al ther he cam, 
At wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram." 

And Shakespeare (A. Y. L. I., I., 1) : "Was not 
Charles, the duke's wrastler, here to speak with me ? " 

Year is often found in Chaucer with the same 
form for the plural as for the singular. The Anglo- 
Saxon neuter gear had the same form in the nom- 
inative plural as in the nominative singular, just as 
had the words for deer, sheep, and swine. These 
latter words have come on down to us with no dis- 
tinction of number, whereas year has taken the s 
of the masculine to form its plural. Compare Lay- 
amon (Brut, 301-2) : 

" He was fiftene yer old 
Tha he to wode ferde." 

And Chaucer (Prol, 601) : 

" Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age." 
See also the example quoted above under guess. 
Compare also Shakespeare (Temp., I., II., 53) : 

" Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since 
Thy father was the duke of Milan, and 
A prince of power." 

The clown in " Hamlet " (V., I.) also uses this form : 
" He will last you some eight year or nine year ; a 
tanner will last you nine year." 

In conclusion may be mentioned three proper 
names which have, besides the usual pronunciation, 
an abreviated one, as is shown by the meter such as 
is now heard colloquially. Antony is reduced to 
Ant'ny, as in " Legend of Good Women," 657 : 

" And when that Antony saw that aventure." 
As also in Shakespeare. Caunterbury is pronounced 
Caunterb'ry, as in the " Prologue," line 22 : 
*' Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage 
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage." 

Jerusalem is apparently reduced to J'rusalem in 
the Prologue," line 463 : 

" And thryes hadde she been at Jerusalem."

COMMUNICA TION. 

DEMOCRATIC CRITICISM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The reference by Mr. Cook to Matthew Arnold and 
his critical principles, in your issue of February 1, re- 
minds me of the remark made by Mr. Arnold, when, on 
a visit to Boston, he was asked if he knew Whitman. 
With languid drawl, slow-rising eyebrows, and hardly 
concealed scorn, he answered: "No, I do not read his 
works. But what does Longfellow think of him ? " If 
he had been told what Thoreau said of Whitman, " He 
is Democracy," would he not have repeated the com- 
ment of Alfred Austin: "I really think he is Democ- 
racy; being, like it, ignorant, sanguine, noisy, coarse, 
and chaotic " ? There is something pathetic in the inca- 
pacity of these and other critics of an aristocratic cul- 
ture to deal either with Whitman or the world-forces 
playing in and through him. Mr. Arnold treated Amer- 
ica with persistent and varied scorn. To the signifi- 
cance of democracy he was insensible; its vision was 
denied him. He is confessedly the critic of the past, 
the spokesman of the feudal world that is " dirged by 
Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme." 

The issue of this discussion of Whitman is, I submit, 
just at this point. Are aristocratic or democratic modes 
of criticism to prevail in the New World ? Are we to 
form our methods on the lines of a culture that is nar- 
row, intellectual, exclusive, or of a culture that is com- 
prehensive, social, inclusive ? The tendency of modern 
criticism, under the combined influences of science and 
democracy, is to substitute relative for absolute stand- 
ards and the personal for the impersonal point of view. 
Aristocratic criticism estimates literary values according 
to absolute standards. Scientific criticism is content 
with description, interpretation, and the study of the 
progress of ideals. Democratic criticism records a per- 
sonal experience. The oue starts from an objective 
form, the second from an objective content, the third 
from a subjective effect. The end of the one is " good 
taste "; of the second, knowledge; of the third, charac- 
ter. The significance of Mr. Burroughs's study of 
Whitman is that it is genuine democratic criticism; it 
is the record of a vital experience, the statement of an 
enthusiasm and a passion. It has heart, and the words 
burn; it has head, and the thoughts strike. 

The limitations of the relative and the subjective are 
to be overcome, not by restricting the personal view, but 
by its extension. Democratic criticism is firmly based on 
character. That is best in art which is best to the best 
person. The best person is the one with the widest 
aesthetic field. The problem of sanity and permanency 
in critical judgment is solved by making an absolutely 
inclusive critic. The content of another of my critics, 
Mr. Watson, to limit his field of possible pleasures, is 
deplorable. Democracy arrives at its result not by nar- 
rowing the interest but by expansion of sympathy till 
the individual includes the multitude. Given an abound- 
ing personality, it is as easy to live in balance on the 
circumference of a circle as at the bounded centre. The 
insanity of an " extreme Whitmanite " is to be corrected 
by seeking madness if you will have it so in a hun- 
dred other directions. Balance Whitman's heat by 
Emerson's ice. Professor Cook is right in living in the 
whole of literature ; but let him not carp at enthusiasm 
and power. He has read Mr. Burroughs to little effect 
if he is not aware of his capacity to respond to myriad 
appeals. The theory of the " sponge " is not so simple 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



as it appears. Said Balaustion, an ideal critic of the 
democratic type, " Poetry is a power that makes." It 
is a power that energizes, so transmuting the reader that 
he shares the poet's privilege and brings forth new 
good and beauty. To be a " sponge " is to be alive in 
every faculty, to have the greatest possible total of ideal 
activity the fullest sensory experience, the most com- 
prehensive intellect, the warmest emotions, the most 
vivid imagination, the freest play of the creative will. It 
is to be capable of inspiration, of receiving the whole of 
life that art affords. Democratic criticism takes for its 
function the exploitation of the theory of the " sponge " 
in just such books as Mr. Burroughs has written. 

Mr. Watson asks, " Why shall we not remain critical 
when we read ' Leaves of Grass ' as much as when we 
read ' Paradise Lost ' ? " For the reason that to remain 
critical (in Mr. Watson's sense) is to remain on the out- 
side of " Leaves of Grass." This is the most human 
book in the world it is almost pure personality. It 
radiates love and adds to the being. John Addiugton 
Symonds spoke of his inability to treat critically a book 
whose essence had entered into the very fibre of his 
being. " In Whitman," says Professor Cook, " the ob- 
ject becomes one with the thinker, in Shakespeare the 
thinker becomes one with the object." This simply 
describes a difference in method and is a disparagement 
of neither. Whitman was a transcendental philosopher, 
Shakespeare was not. It was Whitman's purpose to 
fuse the objects of the universe with himself and through 
himself with his readers; or, as he expresses it 
" To compact you, ye parted diverse lives, 
To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams 
And the winds of the north, and the forests of oak and pine, 
With you soul." 

In an early review of his poems their method is clearly 
described: " He never presents for perusal a poem 
ready made on the old models, and ending when you 
come to the end of it; but every sentence and every pas- 
sage tells of an interior not always seen, and exudes an 
impalpable something which sticks to him that reads and 
provokes him to tread the half-invisible road, where the 
poet, like an apparition, is standing fearlessly before. 
If Walt Whitman's premises are true, then there is a 
subtler range of poetry than that of the grandeur of acts 
and events as in Homer, or of character as in Shake- 
speare. It is the direct bringing of occurrences and 
persons and things to bear on the listener or beholder, 
to reappear through him or her; and it offers the best 
way of making them a part of him or her as the right 
aim of the greatest poet." This is but another state- 
ment of the theory of the " sponge." Mr. Burroughs is 
the only one thus far who has completed and published 
the interior poem. Whitman's works cannot be made to 
operate to any other end than that for which they were 
designed. Whether Whitman is superhuman, or only 
human, is outside the discussion. The necessity of ab- 
sorption does not inhere in the nature of the man but of 
the method. Like Emerson and other interior men, 
Whitman is protected from misconceptions by the mode 
in which he has embodied himself in form. One open 
eye is worth all the closed eyes in the world. 

It was not my function to review Mr. Donaldson's 
book. I do not object to it for what it is not, but for 
what it is. Mr. Harper ought now to publish a treatise 
by Mr. Watson, and another by the writer of the scurri- 
lous reviews on Whitman for " The Nation."

CURIOSITIES OF LITERARY HISTORY.* 

In THE DIAL for March 1, 1896, we re- 
viewed at length the initial volume of Dr. Nic- 
oll's " Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth 
Century," and set forth the aim and scope of 
the projected series of six volumes. Volume 
II. is now at hand, and it sustains the fair 
promise of its predecessor. The piece de resist- 
ance of the book is ostensibly the section en- 
titled "The Building of the Idylls." This 
chapter deals exhaustively with the develop- 
ment of Tennyson's " Idylls of the King," and 
embodies descriptions of " Eneid and Nimue " 
(1857), "The True and the False" (1859), 
" The Last Tournament " (1871), and other 
Tennysonian "trial books," particulars of which 
have not heretofore been satisfactorily recorded. 
Few students, perhaps, have realized the extent 
to which the late Laureate altered, re-wrote, 
and re-cast the various portions of his master- 
work latterly with the intent of welding the 
several separate Idylls into coherent epic form. 
Another section of considerable bibliographic 
interest is that headed " A Contribution to 
the Bibliography of the Writings of Algernon 
Charles Swinburne." Many of Mr. Swin- 
burne's poems and essays have been printed in 
short numbers and in pamphlet form, and some 
of these separate prints are of extraordinary 
scarcity. At least one of them, " Siena," has 
been reproduced in an unauthorized way, and 
copies of the reprint have been fraudulently 
sold as examples of the original issue. The 
usefulness to students and collectors of this 
carefully compiled list is obvious. Besides 
the titles cited above, the volume contains : 
" Three Letters Concerning Ruskin's ' Notes 
on the Construction of Sheepfolds,' by the Rev. 
F. D. Maurice," together with an Introductory 
Note by Dr. Furnivall and extracts from letters 
of Mr. Ruskin touching the discussion ; " The 
Adventures of Ernest Alembert," a fairy tale 
written at fifteen by Charlotte Bronte ; " Eliza- 
beth Barrett Browning, and her scarcer Books" 
including descriptions of " The Battle of 
Marathon " (1820), "An Essay on Mind, with 
Other Poems" (1826), "Prometheus Bound, 
Translated from the Greek of JEschylus, and 
Other Poems" (1833), "Poems" (2 vols.,

yard Kipling " mainly passages from a little 
volume of selections from Mr. Kipling's early 
contributions to Indian Journalism, entitled 
" Letters of Marque " (the book circulated for 
some weeks in India, and was suppressed by 
the author as too immature) ; a letter (1893) 
from Mr. Philip James Bailey, in which the 
author of " Festus " energetically repudiates 
the title of " father of the Spasmodic School "; 
" Tennysoniana," consisting of personal recol- 
lections of the poet and his family, together 
with some particulars of his dealings with his 
publishers, and a letter from Mr. J. W. D'Al- 
beville (reprinted from the " Bookman " of 
December, 1892) regarding the origin of " Riz- 
pah." The volume closes with thirty odd pages 
of ana, wherein the reader may find recorded 
many interesting scraps of literary memorabilia 
and curiosities of literary opinion. Emerson 
fares rather ill in this section. We find, for 
instance, Mr. Ruskin saying of him, in a letter 
addressed to Alexander Ireland (1883), "I 
have never cared much for Emerson, he is little 
more to me than a clever gossip, and his ego- 
ism reiterates itself to provocation "; while Mr. 
John Morley is recorded as having said, in a 
youthful lecture on "Reading " and apropos of a 
class of readers whose only " object is to drench 
the mind in a certain quantity of words," that 



for these there is " no more benefit to be derived 
from Bacon or Shakespeare than from Martin 
Tupper or Ralph Waldo Emerson." Strange 
collocation ! How far the author of this pre- 
cious dictum grew away in riper years from his 
juvenile estimate of Emerson, the readers of 
his admirable Miscellanies know. Among the 
ana we note some interesting epistolary scraps 
by George Eliot. The following, concerning 
marriage, was written to an early school friend 
in 1845 : 

" What should you say to my becoming a wife ? 
Should you think it a duty to ascertain the name of the 
rash man that you might warn him from putting on such 
a matrimonial hair-shirt as he would have with me ? I 
did meditate an engagement, but I have determined, 
whether wisely or not I cannot tell, to defer it, at least 
for the present. My health is not of the strongest 
dreadful headaches come now and then to me as well as 
to the rest of mankind, but idleness is my chief disease, 
and my most salutary medicine the exhortation, Work 
while it is day.' I and my father go on living and lov- 
ing together as usual, and it is my chief source of hap- 
piness to know that I form one item of his. . . . Per- 
haps you would find some symptoms of age creeping 
over me if you were with me now, and you would accuse 
me of being too old for five-and-twenty, which is a suf- 
ficiently venerable sum of years in the calendar of young 
ladies generally. But I can laugh and love and fall 
into a fit of enthusiasm still, so there is some of the 
youthful sap left." 

A letter (1840) from Carlyle to the editor of 
the " Dumfries Herald," touching the reviews 
of his " French Revolution," contains a passage 
in vigorous Carlylese that is worth quoting : 

"You spoke rightly of my Edinburgh Reviewer; a 
dry, sceptical, mechanical lawyer (one Merivale, I hear) , 
with his satchel of Dictionaries dangling at his back 
with the heart of him torpid or dead, and the head of 
him consequently not alive. His notion of Robespierre's 
' religion ' struck me, as it does you, as the product of a 
heart dead. Kill the heart rightly, no head then knows 
rightly what to believe ; has then any right sense of true 
and false left in it! . . . But it does not equal a third 
thing which I found in that article, which I wonder no 
Iconoclast, radical or other, took note of; this namely: 
that ' hunger ' is universal, perennial and irremediable 
among the lower classes of society unknown only 
among the horses and domestic animals; that enlight- 
ened and liberal government means a judicious combin- 
ing of those who are not hungry to suppress those who 
are, and lock them up from revolting! ' The pigs are 
to die, no conceivable help for that; but we, by God's 
blessing, will at least keep down their squealing! ' It 
struck me as the most infernal proposition, written down 
in that cold way, I had ever had presented to me in 
human language unattended with its fit corollary, the 
duty of universal simultaneous suicide,' and a giving 
up of this God's creation on the part of Adam's race as 
a bad job! " 

Passing to " Tennysoniana," we find some 
pleasant jottings by Mr. Robert Roberts. In 
an interview ten years ago with the aged Parish 



144 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



Clerk of Bag Enderby, Mr. Roberts asked his 
interlocutor if he could remember anything 
about Tennyson. 

" Tennyson,' said he. ' D'ya mean tha owd doctor ? ' 
Said I, 'Not the doctor particularly, but any of the 
Tennyson family.' He replied, ' Tha doctor was a fine 
owd gentleman. I remember on 'im dying. It's a 
strange long time agoa, an' he 's in a fine big tomb ageiin 
the church.' I asked, ' Do you remember any of the 
family, any of the sons Charles or Alfred ? ' He 
began to think, stared vacantly, and as the past dimly 
rose before him, said, ' Y-e-e-s, I do remember Muster 
Half red, sewer-ly; he wus alus walkin' about tha lanes 
and closins wi' a book in 'is 'and; but when he grew up 
he wornt at 'oam much; assiver he went up to Lunnon 
or some big place, and when he yeust ta cum 'oam for a 
bit one o' tha servants teld me he yeust ta goa upstairs 
in a top room, an' 'ang a mat ower 'is doar. I doant 
kna' what fur, but they said he did n't want ta 'ear noa 
noise.' " 

The principal facts as to " Muster Halfred " 
gathered from other villagers amounted to the 
one that " 'e wur always dawdlin' about wi' a 
book," whereas, according to local notions, such 
a young fellow ought normally to have been 
rabbiting or rat-baiting, or indulging in some 
other sport suitable to his years and station. 
Very different, as we remember, from these 
bucolic memories of young Tennyson were those 
once gathered in a similar way of Keats one 
rustic witness, when severely cross-questioned 
by a fair votary of the poet, managing to fish 
up from the depths of a reluctant memory the 
discouraging fact that " Muster Keats 'e wur 
fond o' fightin', an' wur a main 'and at pun chin' 
'eds." As Keats's readiness to resort to na- 
ture's weapons was proverbial, the description 
was probably pretty accurate. 

Mr. Roberts was the fortunate owner of one 
of Tennyson's earliest productions a tale 
written by him when a boy, and seemingly un- 
der the joint inspiration of Fenimore Cooper 
and G. P. R. James. It consisted of a half- 
dozen octavo leaves, cased in brown wrapping 
paper, with the title, " Mungo the American," 
written in a hand suggestive of pot-hooks and 
hangers, on the cover. At the foot of the leaf 
was inscribed the name of the " publishers," 
Longman & Co.! Says Mr. Roberts : 

"It is many years since I glanced through it, and 
therefore my recollection is somewhat misty, but plot 
there was none ; it was merely an incident, and related 
how Mungo was traversing the mighty Prairie and lost 
his sword (a rather unusual thing one would think) . He 
wandered about in great agitation, searching for it amid 
poetical surroundings, but all in vain. A considerable 
time elapsed, and again Mungo was journeying in a wide 
waste land, when he espied a hut, toward which he has- 
tened for guidance or for water. As he stood in the 
doorway, he beheld his sword hanging upon the opposite 



wall. He started but recovered himself, and asked the 
solitary inhabitant where he obtained that sword. The 
answer did not prove satisfactory ; or, as this was long 
anterior to the advent of the modern ' interviewer,' Mun- 
go's question was naturally resented as an unwarrantable 
intrusion into the privacy of domestic life. But, what- 
ever the cause, there ensued a short and sharp conflict 
the sudden crack of a pistol, 'alarums and excursions'; 
finally Mungo snatched the weapon from its place and 
' slew him with the sword.' So he regained possession 
of his long-lost trusty blade. The sun set : or threw his 
slanting beams over the prairie or something of that 
sort as Mungo departed from the scene of the fray." 

Another contributor to Tennyson iana has 
some pleasant things to say of the laureate's 
mother a tiny woman of dainty, fairy-like 
mould, who used to speak with pride of her 
" thirty-six feet of sons." A marked charac- 
teristic of Mrs. Tennyson was the impartial 
loyalty with which she stood by all her children. 
When an enthusiastic hero- worshipper once 
said to her, " How proud you must be of 
Alfred ! " the gentle lady thoughtfully replied : 
"Yes ; but Charles and Frederick have written 
very beautiful verses too." 

An extract from Dr. Furnivall's pleasant 
account of his first meeting with Mr. Ruskin, 
at an " At Home " at the house of a London 
friend in 1848, may serve as a fitting close to 
our quotations. We preserve the writer's Lan- 
dorian orthography : 

" After a short chat with the wife, I saw the door 
open, and John Ruskin walkt softly in. I sprang up 
to take the outstretcht hand, and then there began a 
friendship which was for many years the chief joy of my 
life. Ruskin was a tall slight fellow, whose piercing 
frank blue eye lookt through you and drew you to him. 
A fair man, with rough light hair, in a dark-blue frock 
coat with velvet collar, bright Oxford blue stock, black 
trousers and patent slippers how vivid he is to me 
still ! The only blemish in his face was the lower lip, 
which protruded somewhat: he had been bitten there 
by a dog in his early youth. But you ceast to notice 
this as soon as he began to talk. I never met any man 
whose charm of manner at all approach! Ruskin's. 
Partly feminine it was, no doubt; but the delicacy, the 
sympathy, the gentleness and affectionateness of his 
way, the fresh and penetrating things he said, the boyish 
fun, the earnestness, the interest he showd in all deep 
matters, combined to make a whole which I have never 
seen equalled. Association with Ruskin was a continual 
delight. And when one got him to show his Turners to 
charming women like Mrs. Wm. Cowper . . . and the 
like, it was indeed a pleasure to see him and them; the 
pictures had on those days fresh color and fresh light." 

Dr. Nicoll's work thus far bids fair to equal 
in freshness, variety, and intrinsic worth of 
matter his well-known "Literary Anecdotes 
of the Eighteenth Century," the exemplar of 
the present series. The bibliographic element 
is of special value ; and while one or two of the 
sections for instance, the sketch of Cory and

the extracts from Fitzgerald's Common-Place 
Book seem relatively of rather slender inter- 
est, there is nothing in the volume absolutely 
suggestive of padding. The facsimiles of holo- 
graphs and the reproductions of rare title- 
pages, etc., are interesting and well chosen. 
Of the one thousand copies of the work to be 
printed, two hundred and fifty are for America; 
and these will doubtless promptly find their 
way to the shelves of lovers of literary rarities.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN EUROPE.* 



The author of k ' The Historical Development 
of Modern Europe " remarks in his preface : 

" There are two methods of writing the history of 
Europe since 1815, one or the other of which will be 
employed according to the purposes of the writer. The 
first of these is to treat events more or less chronolog- 
ically, by passing from country to country, from national 
to international affairs, not so much with regard to con- 
tinuity of treatment and unity of subject as from a desire 
to keep the history of all the European states at a con- 
stant level. ... A different method [is] that of treat- 
ing separate movements and subjects such as the 
European political system, the Restoration in France, 
the July Monarchy, the liberal movement in Germany, 
as logical wholes, carrying each forward to its issues 
before turning to others." 

The latter impression is left upon the reader's 
mind, as the present review may show, in the 
case of Professor Andrews's work. He gets 
view of events in cycles ; certain similar pur- 
poses actuate men everywhere, producing sim- 
ilar results in countries often remotely apart. 
The unity of Europe's political life in this cen- 
tury, its continuity and the close relation of the 
history of the separate states, are realized. 

The Nineteenth Century began in 1789. Its 
history is the history of the development of 
what was creative in the French Revolution. 
The French Revolution was more than French. 
It was universal. It gave the death-blow to 
feudalism ; substituted equal justice for privi- 
lege ; the national idea for monarchic, feudal, 
and ecclesiastical forms of government. The 
tide of popular right broke over the middle 
walls of class antagonism, as waves over a sea- 
wall. When the people of Europe realized that 
Napoleon's heel was treading down the free 
ideas in government and society upon which he 
himself had been raised to power, then the peo- 
ple burst the bonds with which he sought to

nam's Sons. 



bind them. The people did the work. But the 
governments took the credit unto themselves. 
Outwardly, after 1815, the old lines were re- 
stored as much as possible, for governments are 
conservative. Yet beneath were the great coils 
of things intense, elemental, national, which the 
spirit of revolution had waked to perish never. 

The Vienna Congress cheated the people out 
of almost everything for which they had poured 
out their blood and treasure. If the settlement 
suited the potentates, what matter to the peo- 
ple ? " People " was a sinister word to them, 
too suggestive of the hot days of '89. Under 
the parole of " legitimacy " the coinage of 
Talleyrand's fertile brain the powers of 
Europe fabricated the states of Europe. In 
this continental gerrymander, historical ante- 
cedents, language, religion, race, were all dis- 
regarded. Apportionment was by population 
and taxability. Ecclesiastical states having 
more immunity than others, Austria and Ba- 
varia quarrelled. Alsace and Lorraine could 
not be restored to Germany. Even Gentz, the 
publicist, thought Prussia narrow-minded to 
want it. The future was to prove that Germany 
and all Europe would have profited by the re- 
storation. Germany lost Metz and Strasburg, 
while Russia gained Odessa. Poland was given 
to Russia. Saxony, for its betrayal of the Em- 
pire, was halved to Prussia's advantage. Norway 
was forced to stay by Sweden, although it and 
Denmark had more in common ; while German 
Schleswig-Holstein was wrested from Germany 
and saddled upon Denmark. Belgium and 
Holland were united, though the union was as 
full of explosive possibilities as a mixture of 
saltpetre and charcoal. Austria resumed sway 
over Lombardy, and a suzerainty, through its 
ducal houses, over the most of Italy. Thus 
was the seed of revolution ingeniously planted 
by the sovereigns who thought thus to secure 
their thrones. The germs of three wars and 
many more revolutions were in the arrange- 
ment ; and the end is not yet. 

Germany fared worst, and Austria best. 
Metternich had the advantage of being clear 
in his own mind. He dextrously made use of 
the jealousy of the smaller states of one another 
and their greater jealousy of Prussia. The 
latter favored a national federation, but her 
statesmen had not yet breadth of vision enough 
to see that her greatness lay in the divorce of 
Germany and Austria. It remained for Bis- 
marck to see that. Prussia was unwilling to 
see the empire revamped for Austria's glory, 
but her unsettled purposes ruined Prussia's

present chances. But the Austrian minister's 
ambition to make Austria first, overleaped 
itself. He did not see that in the reduction of 
Prussia to a subordinate place in the Confed- 
eration, he had put a drag upon Austria too. 

The history of Europe for the next genera- 
tion was to be an effort to undo the wrong of 
1815. The most political life upon the conti- 
nent was in France. Not that that life was 
recognized in law ; it was there in fact. The 
national pride was not exhausted. On the con- 
trary, the sting to French pride by the spec- 
tacle of a government imposed by the sword 
and that too of a foreigner, at least so far as 
sympathy with the new spirit of France was 
concerned, quickened the nation's sensibili- 
ties. Hitherto France's government had been 
of her own making : even the Terror and the 
Ca3sarism of Napoleon. The Bourbon Restora- 
tion was not thus. Yet it had to be so. There 
were no positive elements in France upon which 
to build. The Revolution had been mainly a 
destructive force. When Napoleon was gone, 
there were only the remnants of former parties 
jealous of one another and unable to unite upon 
any policy. Hence a government had to be 
imported a government sure of its seat only 
so long as the negative elements failed to com- 
bine. 

Light for New Europe gleamed and there 
faintly in England. Even across the chan- 
nel, reaction prevailed. Suspension of the right 
of habeas corpus, censorship of the press, gag- 
laws, propped a Tory regime. But England's 
was a government of law. England was the 
hearth of constitutional liberty. Her people 
were intelligent, and would have been thrifty if 
they could have had the chance. Moreover, 
the land had never felt Napoleon's heel. There 
was no hope for the association of England and 
France, however, for a Bourbon could not strike 
hands with a Briton without compromising his 
position, without acknowledging the supremacy 
of the law ; and Louis XVIII., in ignoring the 
constitution of the provisional government and 
substituting one of his own, had practically 
affirmed that he owned the crown and the na- 
tion too. Tallyrand's fall in the autumn of 1815 
prevented any possibility of French and English 
affiliation. Richelieu was honest, but a man of 
little talent. The real control of the government's 
policy was in the hands of the Count d'Artois, 
an ultra-royalist. The Chamber of Deputies 
was so royalistic that it was impossible to find 
any other sort of man. Europe stood amazed at 
the spectacle of an ultra-royalistic crown and 



cabinet assailed by a body of representatives 
because the executive was not royalistic enough I 
The 21st of January, the anniversary of Louis 
XVI.'s execution, was made a memorial day. 
The legislature passed a set of laws of which it 
was said that " one half France may arrest the 
other half and try it before an extraordinary 
court." The Jesuits were restored, schools put 
under church control, mortmain renewed, the 
emigres were brought back and reimbursed at 
enormous expenditure. In the face of such 
reactionary zeal Europe felt safe in withdraw- 
ing the army of occupation in 1818. The next 
election proved the artificial expression France 
had worn. The Liberals got twenty-three of the 
fifty-five seats, among them being Lafayette. 
Richelieu resigned. Decazes, a moderate roy- 
alist, succeeded. The mixture of parties was 
complex and peculiar. An element headed by 
Guizot held that the Liberals would be too lib- 
eral, and that they the so-called Doctrinaires 
would be called upon to take the govern- 
ment. Thus the Liberals were the real Doc- 
trinaires, and the so-called Doctrinaires were 
the party of practical politics. The fact that 
no one of the parties, however, had a positive 
programme was a danger to France. 

In Germany, the people had fallen back into 
the depths, spent and exhausted, after the War 
of Liberation. The nation had risen above 
itself : its fall was the greater. Moreover, the 
settlement of 1815 had left no most powerful 
state to take the lead. Austria and Prussia 
were balanced, and particularism reigned every- 
where. Again, the mind of Germany was not 
adapted to grasp political ideas and give them 
concrete manifestation in institutions. The ex- 
altation of 1813 remained as a mental quality 
when political life was in the depths. Sentiment 
and imagination Romanticism reigned. 
What Germany needed was force, rude phy- 
sical force, to shake it from its trance. The 
policy of " blood and iron " had to come. The 
salvation of Germany lay with Prussia, but as 
yet she knew not her mission. But if Prussia 
had no clear political policy, the Zollverein 
inspired by her was to give Germany a germ 
of economic unity destined to become political 
in character. The weakest point in Prussia, 
however, was the fact that by her development 
she was absolute in law, in thinking, in train- 
ing ; hence her conduct depended in largest 
part upon the character of her sovereign, and 
he was weak. 

Curiously enough, though, the first real blow 
to this rigid and reactionary condition of things 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

was to come through events in Spain, just as 
the first resistance which Napoleon could not 
crush was also found in Spain. In Spain, Fer- 
dinand VII., as infamous a king as ever sat 
upon a throne a seat restored to him by the 
Holy Alliance had restored the old things to 
such a degree that even the Inquisition was 
reestablished. Spain was too dead to respond, 
too craven to protest. What in a living state 
is a public calamity outside intervention in 
Spain's case alone could prevail. Spanish des- 
potism naturally had nothing in common with 
English reign of law. Yet it was England that 
was to make her influence felt in the peninsula. 
The event which brought this about was the 
revolt of the South American colonies. Spain 
demanded that as Europe had crushed the spirit 
of '89, so now it should unite to crush the ris- 
ing revolution across sea ; in other words, that 
the principles of the Holy Alliance be applied 
in South America. This reaction, as a world- 
comprising idea, alarmed Great Britain. Mean- 
while, the fire of revolution leaped to Italy and 
Greece. In France, the murder of the Duke 
of Berry, the sole representative of the Bourbon 
family apart from the king, produced renewed 
reaction, and an ultra- royalist ministry came 
into power. Villele determined to succor Spain, 
partly to sustain the principle of " legitimacy," 
partly to divert the excited passions of the 
French from the consideration of matters at 
home, partly to restore national prestige, always 
military in its expression. While Austria 
crushed Italy, Angouleme, on the 27th of 
March, 1823, entered Spain. England was too 
cautious to interfere directly. Canning had no 
mind to expend money and men in support of 
so uncertain a thing as Spanish liberalism. But 
the indirect blow he delivered Spain and the 
Holy Alliance was more positive than armed 
intervention could have been. By a stroke of 
his pen, the British government recognized the 
revolted Spanish- American republics. That act 
of renunciation of the existing political princi- 
ples of Europe isolated Great Britain. The Eu- 
ropean constellation was broken. It was the first 
successful protest against Metternichism. The 
restoration of Ferdinand was a success on the 
surface only. The spectacle of such a ruler 
as Ferdinand VII. reigning " by the grace of 
God " shocked the sense of Europe. The Greek 
Revolution accentuated this just horror. Turk- 
ish atrocities and Greece's heroic struggle 
awakened unbounded sympathy. Conquest of 
Greece at last became impossible. Vienna and 
St. Petersburg disagreed upon what should be 



done with Greece. Russia could not hope to 
acquire Turkey yet, and therefore proposed a 
number of half-sovereign states under Ottoman 
suzerainty. Metternich opposed such a crea- 
tion, as it would weaken Turkey and give op- 
portunity for Russian interference. From this 
time Austria and Prussia parted. The Holy 
Alliance had carried in its own bosom the 
weapons of its own destruction. What was left 
of it was shot to pieces at Navarino. Austria's 
prestige was tarnished. Prussia's economic 
policy was paving the way for constructive 
statesmanship. Peel and Grey and Goderich 
in England were leading reform measures. 
Already the globe was cracked. In the Revo- 
lution of 1830 in France, in the cleavage be- 
tween Belgium and Holland, in the Reform 
Bill of 1832, the people emerged. The force 
that had lain dormant and crushed was raised 
up. The people were raw and crude but gen- 
uine. They rose from their narcoticized slum- 
ber of nearly twenty years and rubbed the sleep 
from their eyes. 

The next eighteen years was to be a transi- 
tion period a period of oscillation between 
the governments and the people. Things were 
most stable in England, most unstable in 
France. In Germany liberalism was on the 
increase, Metternichism on the decline. The 
influence of the personal character of Prussia's 
ruler was to hinder German development until 
the regent succeeded as King William I. in 
1862. But the revolution of 1848 was decisive 
for Europe. Two centres remained out of the 
old despotism, " the camp of Austria's army 
and the court of Russia." Race divisions in 
Austro - Hungary, political complications in 
Germany, lack of efficient leadership in Italy, 
defeated successful revolutions there. But the 
" Wonderful Days " of '48 were not a mirage 
nor a haze upon the horizon. " The effects 
were not lost. Things which had been visions 
became realities. Political interest and new 
life were aroused. The Revolution gave a vivid 
sense of unity to both Italy and Germany. It 
frightened governments, liberalized their policy, 
by showing how insecure was their foundations. 
It showed the people their weakness, the dan- 
ger of race prejudices, and the futility of the 
revolutionary and radical methods. It brought 
to the front as leaders of unity and liberalism 
men of greater diplomatic and administrative 
ability. Already are Bismarck, Cavour, and 
Deak prominent in their respective places."

Development of Modern Europe " tells of the

JAMES WESTFALL THOMPSON. 



" THE ARCH- AMATEUR OF ALL, HISTORY." * 

Author, naval commander, diplomatist, phi- 
losopher, mystic, all of these, and more, was 
Sir Keneltn Digby. His epitaph proclaims him 

" Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise ; 
This age's wonder for his noble parts, 
Skilled in six tongues and learned in all the arts." 

Lord Clarendon said of him : " He was a man 
of a very extraordinary person and presence, 
which drew the eyes of all men upon him, which 
were more fixed by a wonderful graceful behav- 
iour, a flowing courtesy and civility, and such 
a volubility of language as surprised and de- 
lighted." Henry Stubbes called him " the very 
Pliny of our age for lying "; his contemporaries 
agreed in their admiration of his varied accom- 
plishments and brilliant conversational powers ; 
and his latest biographer, in his final estimate 
of the man, characterizes him as a gifted ama- 
teur, " perhaps the arch-amateur of all history." 

An interesting character he certainly was, 
and the present life of him, by "one of his de- 
scendants," is very good reading indeed. The 
brief and modest preface predisposes one in the 
author's favor. The lack of any satisfactory 
biography of Digby is pointed out, and the hope 
expressed that if the present attempt to supply 
one shall prove a failure, it may yet stimulate 
some " able writer, languishing for want of a 
subject, to produce a really brilliant biography 
of Sir Kenelm Digby." 

A foot-note tells us that Digby was born in 
1603, although in the body of the book (p. 129) 
we read that certain things happened in 1624, 
" when he was of the age of nineteen." But 
as in the concluding portion of the work it is 
stated that he died in 1665, " at the age of sixty- 
two," and as other authorities agree in giving 
1603 as the year of his birth, we conclude that 
the statement on page 129 forms one of the

scendants. With Illustrations. New York: Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 



very few errors, whether of author or printer, 
to be found in the entire work. The first half 
of the book is principally taken up with the one 
absorbing love-affair of Kenelm's childhood, 
youth, and early manhood, and with the secret 
marriage of the faithful lovers and the compli- 
cations resulting therefrom. The lady was the 
peerless Venetia Anastasia Stanley, daughter 
of Sir Edward Stanley ; and as the whole story 
of their love and marriage is as interesting as 
a modern novel, we will not spoil it for the fu- 
ture readers of the book by giving details. 

Sir Everard Digby, Kenelm's father, was ex- 
ecuted in 1606 for complicity in the Gunpowder 
Plot. After two years at Oxford, Digby was 
induced to go abroad by his mother, who sought 
thus to make him forget Venetia Stanley. The 
young man, not yet eighteen years of age, went 
first to Paris, and thence to Angers, to escape 
the plague. But having here attracted the too 
favorable notice of the queen-mother, Marie 
de Medicis, he avoided her importunities by 
spreading a report of his death and proceeding 
to Italy. Two years were spent in Florence, 
and then he was invited to Madrid by his kins- 
man, Sir John Digby, Earl of Bristol, who was 
at that time English ambassador to the Spanish 
court. Prince Charles and Buckingham arrived 
at Madrid a few days after Digby's coming, 
their mission being to obtain the hand of the 
Infanta for the young prince. The nearer view 
of the Spanish court, of Spanish diplomacy, 
and of the characters of Prince Charles and the 
Duke, which the author here gives us, drawing 
principally from Digby's " Private Memoires," 
is valuable, and forms the most interesting, if 
not the most important, part of the book. Bits 
of love and intrigue, too, are not wanting to give 
spice to the narrative. 

The return to England, the knighting of the 
young wanderer, his secret marriage to the 
matchless Venetia, his wonderful experiments 
with the " sympathetic powder," and the account 
of other chemical nostrums believed in by the 
credulous would-be discoverer, follow next in 
order. And then, being upbraided by his noble 
relative, the ex-ambassador, for nursing " a 
servile affection which, wheresoever it entereth, 
is a clog to generous spirits and freezeth all 
heroic thoughts in their very births," Sir 
Kenelm resolved to embark on an enterprise 
which should be worthy of a gentleman of his 
parts and valor, and clear him from any impu- 
tation of indolence. Accordingly, with the 
royal permission, he equipped a small fleet and 
set sail for the Mediterranean on a privateering

cruise, in which he captured some considerable 
prizes, won a victory over the French and 
Venetian vessels in the harbor of Scanderoon, 
and finally returned to England with much 
pelf and not a little renown. " In that drowsy 
and inactive time," says Clarendon, the victory 
at Scanderoon " was looked upon with general 
estimation." The author of the present biog- 
raphy, however, does not attempt to make Sir 
Kenelm out as much better than a pirate in 
this expedition, and he seems entirely right in 
this view of the case. 

The latter part of the book treating of 
Digby's repeated banishments and recalls, his 
examinations for alleged connection with the 
popish recusants, and his imprisonment at 
Winchester House is of less general interest 
than the earlier chapters, and may be dismissed 
with a few words. This portion is important, 
however, as affording a view of the man which 
is not in all respects flattering, much as the 
reader might wish the contrary. But, as the 
writer says, " human nature is human nature, 
and Sir Kenelm was essentially human ; he was 
no great saint, he was naturally of a diplomatic 
disposition, he was a courtier, and he had what 
is called ' a keen eye to the main chance.' " 

After all the vicissitudes of a somewhat 
stormy career, he died peacefully at his own 
home in Co vent Garden, where, until the last, 
he was wont to gather scientists and scholars 
about him, and where, another writer tells us, 
he often " wrangled " with Hobbes. He was 
one of the founders of the Royal Society, and 
was a member of the council at the time of its 
incorporation in 1663. Throughout his life he 
was possessed of an active and inquiring mind, 
and was a shrewd observer of natural phenom- 
ena, although he was a scientific amateur rather 
than a man of science. Devoting himself seri- 
ously to astrology and alchemy, his credulity 
led him into many absurdities. But he held in 
high esteem Bacon, Galileo, Gilbert, Harvey, 
and Descartes, and is said to have been the 
first to notice the necessity of vital air, or oxy- 
gen, to the life of plants. (See his " Vegeta- 
tion of Plants.") 

The sources drawn upon by his biographer 
are, in the main, Digby's own " Private Me- 
moires," which bring his life down to 1629, and 
have been edited, with a long introduction, by 
Sir Harris Nicholas ; Wood's " Athenae Oxon- 
ienses," the "Biographia Britannica," Aubrey's 
" Letters " and " Lives," Lodge's " Portraits," 
the "Crosby Records," the "State Papers," 
Digby's own miscellaneous writings, and various 



histories of England, memoirs, and letters. The 
volume under review contains good reproduc- 
tions of two portraits (one by Vandyck) of Sir 
Kenelm, one of Sir Everard, and one (by Van- 
dyck) of Lady Venetia Digby, together with a 
view of Gothurst, Sir Kenelm's early home. 
Paper and print are all that a fastidious biblio- 
phile could desire, and one needs but to open 
the book to become interested. We only regret 
that the author has so carefully concealed his 
identity. Beyond the fact that he is one of 
Sir Kenelm's descendants, that he is accord- 
ing to the title-page the author of " The Life 
of a Conspirator " (Sir Everard Digby), " A 
Life of Archbishop Laud," "The Life of a 
Prig " and hence of all the other engaging 
little volumes from the " Prig's " pen we 
know nothing, except that he signs the preface 
to this book with the initials " T. L." Perhaps 
some reader more skilled than the reviewer in 
such matters can throw light upon the question 
of his identity. p ERCY R BICKNELL. 



MODERN APPRECIATIONS OF THE STAGE.* 



The attitude of the public mind toward " the 
drama " and " the stage " has presented some 
curious phases. For two hundred years En- 
glish-speaking peoples pointed to Shakespeare, 
writer of plays, as the greatest of all writers ; 
on our literature of the stage we based our 
claim to ownership of the world's greatest lit- 
erature ; yet at the same time the stage itself 
was shunned by pious folk and condemned by 
church and council, and the poor players were 
placed under social ostracism, sometimes even 
denied sacraments, funeral rites, and marriage 
by the clergy. It is very different in our day. 
While the drama as a form of literary expres- 
sion is cultivated but little and without striking 
success, the stage and the actor were never so 
much honored. Although no great writer en- 
riches contemporary dramatic literature, the 
profession of actor is steadily growing in favor 
with the educated classes. The most eminent 
of living English actors is honored with knight- 
hood and Sir Henry Irving is invited to lec- 
ture at the high seats of learning both in En- 
gland and America, choosing for his theme the 
praise of his art ; an English clergyman a few

years ago dedicated a memorial window to 
Shakespeare in a London church, and still 
more recently an American " divine " delivered 
the address at the opening of a new theatre. 
Play-houses multiply rapidly ; and the week- 
day audiences at a first-class theatre are as intel- 
ligent, as well-mannered, and probably as vir- 
tuous, as the Sunday audiences at the churches. 

Sir Henry Irving defines acting as " the art 
embodying the poet's creations, of giving them 
flesh and blood, of making the figures which 
appeal to your mind's eye in the printed drama 
live before you on the stage." He regards the 
actor as the complement of the author, not 
merely his translator ; apparently, he ranks the 
art of reproduction of character not far below 
the art of original creation of character. 

With this new dignity accorded to the actor's 
calling comes a new interest in actors, espe- 
cially in actors of Shakespearian roles. We 
desire to supplement the dicta of the critics 
even such critics as Lamb, Hazlitt, Coleridge, 
and Schlegel by the record of such actors as 
Garrick, Kean, Kemble, Macready, Booth, 
Irving, men of high imagination, who have 
made life-long studies for their impersonations 
of Hamlet, Shy lock, Macbeth, or Lear, in order 
to present these " in their habit as they lived." 
But, alas ! as has been so often pointed out, no 
other art is so fleeting as that of the actor. 
While all other artists may leave behind them 
lasting memorials of their genius, the player's 
work vanishes with his disappearance from the 
stage, and survives only in the recollection of 
the few who have seen and heard him. 

To collect and preserve some of the records 
of the great actors and actresses of the past 
and present is the worthy undertaking of Mr. 
Charles E. L. Wingate, in a series of entertain- 
ing volumes. Following soon after his earlier 
work, " Shakespeare's Heroines of the Stage," 
come two other volumes, " Shakespeare's He- 
roes of the Stage" and "Famous American 
Actors of To-day" the latter bearing also 
the name of Frederic Edward McKay as asso- 
ciate editor, the sketches (forty-two in number) 
being contributed by different hands, mostly 
dramatic critics of leading newspapers. Othello, 
Lear, Shylock, Coriolanus, Macbeth, Hamlet, 
Richard III. are the "Shakespeare Heroes," 
and the book tells something about every actor 
of prominence in these roles from the days of 
Burbage and Betterton to the present. Also, 
the author has taken great pains in collecting 
rare portraits ; and nothing could be a better 
commentary on the advance of the histrionic 



art in the matter of historical accuracy and 
appropriate costume than these pictures. For 
example, here is Quin as Coriolanus, dressed 
in a tunic with flaring hoop-skirts, and his head 
surmounted with plumes two feet high ; and 
Garrick as he played Lear, in a ruffled waist- 
coat, knickerbockers, and silk hose. The seri- 
ous student will regret that so much space ha& 
been given to anecdote and green-room gossip y 
although these chatty features may give the 
work a certain popularity of a temporary kind, 
a different handling of the material and more 
dignity of treatment would have given it a lit- 
erary and critical value which it now lacks. 

The collection of " Famous American Ac- 
tors " includes those who have died recently, 
as well as those still living. The lives here 
recorded are, most of them, of a high, clean, 
noble, and inspiring order. With such person- 
alities as Joseph Jefferson, Edwin Booth, Mme. 
Modjeska, and Lawrence Barrett as subjects, 
and such writers as Henry A. Clapp, Philip 
Hale, " Dorothy Lundt," Laurence Hutton, 
and George Parsons Lathrop to deal with them, 
we have a book of much literary and critical 
value, albeit a large number of lesser names 
have been admitted that might well be spared. 
The work ought to do much to clear the actor's 
calling from such odium as may still linger 
about it, for not many professions could make 
a better showing of genuine and conspicuous

THE CHURCH, PAST AND PRESENT.* 

There is no more interesting section of church 
history from several points of view than that of 
the fourteenth century. " The Great Western 
Schism " is an uncovering of some of the deep- 
est schemes of ecclesiastical corruption and 
infamy ever known in the Church of Rome. 
Dr. Locke gives us, in his volume on this topic, 
a popular and of course very much abbre- 
viated recital of the chief events of this cen-

tury, carrying the narrative through the coun- 
cil of Basel. The " Babylonic captivity " of 
the papal see to Avignon, then the double- 
headed church, the clashiugs, the bulls and 
counter -bulls of contemporaneous popes, the 
great councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basel, 
constitute a panorama of the degradation and 
corruption of ecclesiastics, and the almost fruit- 
less efforts at reform, such as shocks the good 
sense and the moral consciousness of purely 
political bodies of this century. Dr. Locke's 
general outline is well sketched, though it is 
somewhat humiliating to find him so frequently 
falling into the use of colloquialisms and almost 
slang phrases to express himself. The more 
of such clear-cut outlines the better. They give 
the popular reader an appetite which can be 
appeased only by further indulgence in works 
on the same period. 

The mighty influence of the Church of En- 
gland during the last thousand years demands 
more than ordinary notice in church history. 
Mr. Wakeman has undertaken, in his book of 
500 pages, to introduce the reader to the his- 
tory of that body from its origin to the present 
day. It is not a manual or a text-book in form 
or style, but is written in a running narrative. 
The chapters are not long, are well condensed, 
and charmingly written. There is just enough 
of incident or anecdote mixed in the pictures 
to give them a delightful fascination. The 
reader finds just what he expects in the line of 
Episcopal prejudices. Though remarkably free 
for a churchman, he sometimes falls into the 
snare of special pleading. One of the striking 
sections of the book is that dealing with the 
ecclesiastical eruptions and disruptions of the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Inquisition 
under fire and flame, persecution by torture and 
torment, and worse than death-pangs, were the 
results of adopting and maintaining heretical 
views on ecclesiastical, and almost on political, 
questions. The marvel is that the church could 
be both the executioner of spiritual men and 
the conserver of spiritual truth. But out of 
this dead formalism, not many years hence, 
sprang the life element of the dissenters which 
not only stirred England to its foundations, but 
galvanized the old church into a new life, and 
became a mighty force in the foundation of 
modern church history. Mr. Wakeman gives 
us vivid and thrilling descriptions of some of 
those events, which will stimulate readers to 
search out the larger works to find satiety. The 
book is provided with an admirable chronolog- 
ical table covering eleven closely printed pages. 



A full index completes the volume. The pub- 
lishers also have done their part in making a 
handsome and useful book. 

This is the day of unions commercial, 
social, labor, and not-quite-ecclesiastical. Dr. 
Mason, in his work on "The Principles of 
Ecclesiastical Unity," has set for himself the 
task of telling how he thinks this union can be 
consummated. Lecture I., on the " Duty of 
Unity," is a practical rebuttal of the Pope's 
encyclical ad Anglos, and a weak discussion of 
the duty of unity as based on the teachings of 
Scripture. Lecture II., on the internal prin- 
ciple of unity, is simply the fact that in Christ 
all are brethren, hence should be working 
toward the same end with one purpose. * Lec- 
ture III. reveals the attachments of the lec- 
turer. The external principle is the fact that 
the Church of England, the Roman Church, 
and the Greek Church possess the only author- 
ized ordained ministers ; and that true union 
would mean the lifting of all dissenting bodies 
to the high plane of accepting ordination at the 
hands of the Church which has preserved from 
the beginning an unbroken succession of author- 
ized and ordained clergy. He even goes so far 
as to say : 

" In a country where there is an authoritative Church 
a church which has not apostatised from the faith and 
which imposes no terms of communion with which it is 
sinful to comply there, for any group of Christians 
who have received no commission [in succession from 
apostolic times] for the purpose to take upon them 
the office of ordaining, is, I will not say inexcusably or 
necessarily wicked, but essentially anarchichal " (p. 90). 
" It would be faithless and disloyal to quit this church " 
(p. 91). 

This is the spirit in which the lecturer pro- 
poses the union, " You join us and we '11 unite, 
and form a union." Such a proposition is ab- 
surd on the face of it. Only the Church of 
Rome and her western cousin are possible allies 
of such a body. To Protestant Christendom 
he openly says, " Accept our tenets, and there 
will be union." It is wasted time, empty words, 
and only a clanging cymbal, to be haranguing 
audiences in this fashion. 

Why " The Prophets of the Christian Faith " 
in the title of Dr. Lyman Abbott's volume ? 
Fifty as noble saints might have been chosen

THE REMINISCENCES or A FAMOUS 
MAESTRO.* 



Musical people, and many others, know that 
Signor Luigi Arditi is one of the most popular 
orchestral conductors of Italian opera in the 
world. Born seventy-four years ago, at Cres- 
centino in central Piedmont, and always turn- 
ing affectionately to the beautiful land of his 
nativity, Arditi is yet an American citizen. He 
married, in 1856, a lady of Richmond, Va., and 
has since regarded this as his adopted coun- 
try. He speaks of it always with the enthu- 
siasm of the lover : what pleases him, pleases 
him very much ; but his praise, though never 
half-hearted, seems judiciously bestowed, and 
his criticism is always good-natured. He writes 
with a good command of English, in so natural 
and easy a style that one is seldom reminded 
that a foreigner holds the pen. 

Signor Arditi has conducted operas in all 
the great cities of this country and Europe, and 
nearly all the great singers of the past fifty 
years have either made their debuts or sung 
under his baton. His reminiscences, therefore, 
present many charming sketches and anecdotes 
of world-famous musicians and other noted peo- 
ple with whom he came in contact. Of Alboni, 
with whom he appeared in the United States 
in 1850, he says : 

" She was a most charming and amiable woman, and 
it was impossible to know her without liking and re- 
specting her. Unlike many prime donne I have since 
known, who find it hard to stand the wear and tear and 
trying ordeal of rehearsal and study of opera without 
losing their serenity of temper, Alboni was a veritable 
embodiment of immutable good-nature and affability. 
. . . Singing was a second nature to her. She loved 
her work, and revelled in her triumphs. Her vocal 
compass was perfectly marvellous. I wrote some vari- 
ations for her once, wherein she trilled on the high B 
flat with the greatest facility, immediately passing to

Illustrations, Facsimiles, etc. Edited and compiled, with

York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



the lower G; and although she suffered from intense 
nervousness at such a marvellous feat, considering that 
her voice was practically a contralto, she acquitted her- 
self so brilliantly of the passage in question that her 
audiences on every occasion of her singing the music 
were stirred to the greatest enthusiasm." 

It was for Piccolomini that Arditi composed 
his famous " II Bacio," in 1859, which, while 
it has made fortunes for several others, has 
netted the author just .50. Some amusing 
incidents are given in connection with this song, 
the title of which was suggested by Madame 
Arditi. 

Of Christine Nilsson, who made her London 
debut in " La Traviata," in 1867, he writes : 

" Nilsson's singing reminded me greatly of Angiolina 
Bosio, her brilliant jioriture being delivered with the 
same exquisite grace and refinement that characterized 
the style of the Italian artist. Everything was in favor 
of the young Swedish artist, her youthful freshness 
(in itself a priceless charm); a definite individuality; 
her slight, supple figure, which lent itself to the draping 
of any classical robe; and above all, the voice, of exten- 
sive compass, mellow, sweet, and rich." 

The artist who receives the largest share of 
attention in this book is Adelini Patti, with 
whom Signor Arditi's acquaintance began when 
theprima donna was only eight years old. His 
account of their first meeting is as follows : 

" Madame Salvador Patti, Adelina's mother, was 
anxious that I should hear the child sing, and so she 
brought her little daughter to my rooms one day. [This 
was in New York.] Bottesini and I were highly amused 
to see the air of importance with which the tiny song- 
stress first selected a comfortable seat for her doll in 
such proximity that she was able to see her while sing- 
ing, and then, having said, ' La, ma bonne petite, attends 
que ta Maman te chante quelque chose de jolie,' she 
demurely placed her music on the piano, and asked me 
to accompany her in the rondo of ' Sonnambula.' 

" How am I to give an adequate description of the 
effect which that child's miraculous notes produced upon 
our enchanted senses? Perhaps if I say that both Bot- 
tesini and I wept genuine tears of emotion, tears which 
were the outcome of the original and never-to-be-for- 
gotten impression her voice made when it stirred our 
innermost feelings, that may, in some slight measure, 
convince my readers of the extraordinary vocal power 
and beauty of which little Adelina was, at that tender 
age, possessed. We were simply amazed, nay, electri- 
fied, at the well-nigh perfect manner in which she de- 
livered some of the most difficult and varied arias with- 
out the slightest effort or self-consciousness." 

Signor Arditi has made many tours with Patti, 
and is her warm friend and admirer. Surely 
the most delightful house-party that one ever 
read about was that extending over four weeks, 
which the Arditis spent with Count Nicolini 
and his wife at their Craig- Y-Nos home in 
August, 1889. The account reads like a page 
from the " Arabian Nights."

RECENT FICTION.* 



It is a rather remarkable fact that what are un- 
questionably the two greatest novels of the present 
season should be works of historical fiction. One 
of these novels, the Polish "Quo Vadis," we re- 
viewed some weeks ago ; the other, " On the Face 
of the Waters," calls for our chief attention in the 
present survey of recently-published novels. We 
have heretofore expressed the opinion that, as a de- 
lineator of Indian life, Mrs. Steel stands, not ex- 
actly as a rival of Mr. Kipling for her elaborate 
compositions are as unlike his flash-light photographs 
as they could possibly be but as Mr. Kipling's 
peer among workers in this comparatively new im- 
aginative field. Of course, there were great men 
before Agamemnon, and good books about India 
were written before Mrs. Steel and Mr. Kipling 
were born, but these two writers satisfy our modern

desires fall in with our searching psychological 
proclivities and our envisagement of ethnological 
distinctions as none of the older generations can 
possibly do, and for us, at least, they make both the 
Indian and the Anglo-Indian seem alive. Compar- 
ison between the two writers is an idle task ; each 
has his gifts and his limitations, and little need be 
said beyond the statement that one is in no sense 
an imitator of the other. Certainly, Mrs. Steel 
could not do Mr. Kipling's most characteristic things, 
and equally certainly Mr. Kipling could not write 
a long novel having the close texture of Mrs. Steel's 
book, and sustained, as that book is, upon an almost 
epic level. So much for the inevitable coupling of 
the two names ; let us now try to see something of 
what Mrs. Steel has done. In the first place, it 
must be admitted that her work is faulty. There 
is nothing pellucid about the stream of her narra- 
tive, which rushes along over a rough bed, and has 
many whirling eddies. The transitions from scene 
to scene are so abrupt that the plan of the whole has 
a patchwork effect, and many of the paragraphs 
must be reread before one can find out their mean- 
ing or what they are about. The style is not only 
unpolished, but even lapses into gross solecisms, as 
in the frequent use of locutions which make " like" 
do duty as a conjunction. These are not promising 
phrases with which to begin the characterization of 
a great novel, yet great in the sober sense of that 
overworked word this novel undoubtedly is. For 
its faults are but surface-faults, after all, and, to 
revert to our metaphor, the stream has volume and 
depth, and the strength that they imply. In the 
first place, it has one of the greatest themes that 
history can offer the theme of those months of 
terror that forty years ago prepared for English- 
men so splendid a heritage of heroism that the mem- 
ory of the Mutiny even to-day thrills through and 
through every man of English race. This note of 
heroic passion and pride informs Mrs. Steel's work 
from beginning to end. She does not gloss over the 
faults of English rule in Hindostan, nor does she 
attempt to conceal the amazingly impolitic course 
of conduct that led to the outbreak, but she does 
understand how richly English devotion made atone- 
ment, during that fateful summer of 1857, for the 
errors of English policy, and, in this sense, Mr. 
Kipling's 

" If blood be the price of admiralty, 
Lord God, we ha' paid in full ! " 

might be taken, mutatis mutandis, as the motto of 
her work. In the second place, Mrs. Steel makes 
us understand, as no novelist before her has suc- 
ceeded in doing, the Sepoy point of view. She knows 
what the religious fanaticism of Brahman and Mo- 
hammedan meant at the time of the Mutiny, with 
how deep a sense of wrong the native was filled as 
he contemplated the assaults of the foreigner upon 
the most sacred traditions of his faith, what was the 
play of the Oriental mind in some respects child- 
ishly simple, and in others subtle beyond any occi- 
dental comprehension upon the events connected

with the fastening upon British India of the yoke of 
the despised but feared foreigner. It is in the two 
features ahove set forth, and in the way in which 
they are balanced and given each its due value, that 
the power of this novel chiefly consists. It does not 
deal with the whole history of the Mutiny, but solely 
with the siege and capture of Delhi. Cawnpore 
and Lucknow are referred to only in an incidental 
way ; the names of Lawrence, Campbell, and Have- 
lock are barely mentioned ; John Nicholson is its 
one conspicuous historical hero. But, within its 
limits, the book is history in a very exact sense. 
" The reader may rest assured that every incident 
bearing in the remotest degree on the Indian Mu- 
tiny, or on the part which real men took in it, is 
scrupulously exact, even to the date, the hour, the 
scene, the very weather. Nor have I allowed the 
actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word 
regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts 
of eye-witnesses, or in their own writings." As for 
the fictive part of the book, the chief interest lies in 
the fortunes of the English woman who remains 
secreted in Delhi during the siege, and in the two 
men her husband and the stranger whose fortunes 
become so strangely linked with hers who illus- 
trate anew the old idea that a great occasion may 
make a hero out of the most contemptible material. 
These three figures are triumphs of portraiture, and 
show the creative powers of the writer to be upon a 
plane with her conception of the essential spirit of the 
history concerned. The alluring poetic title of the 
novel is thus explained : " I have chosen it because 
when you ask an uneducated native of India why the 
Great Rebellion came to pass, he will, in nine cases 
out of ten, reply, ' God knows ! He sent a Breath 
into the World.' From this to a Spirit moving on 
the face of the Waters is not far." The controlling 
artistic impulse which led to this felicitous choice of 
a title has been with the author throughout her work, 
and has made of it, despite all surface defects, a 
novel of quite extraordinary value and vitality. 

In comparison with a work like the above, the 
best of everyday novels must seem tame and com- 
monplace, and the rest of those that we have grouped 
in the present review may be dismissed with very 
brief mention. Since the contrast must be marked 
in any case, we may as well make it as marked as 
possible by placing Miss Macleod's " Green Fire " 
next upon our list. It is by no means intended to 
say that this book is as poor as its predecessor is 
good, but merely that the qualities of Celtic imagi- 
nation which it displays in such abundant measure 
are as remote as anything well can be from Mrs. 
Steel's dramatic actualities. The dreamiest moon- 
light and the most fervent sunshine are not further 
apart than two such books are in spirit, to say nothing 
of fact. The style of " Green Fire " alone makes 
the reading of the book a pleasant task, and yet the 
effect, almost magical at times, is produced by sim- 
ple means. Take such a sentence as this for ex- 
ample : " St. Martin's summer came at last, and 
with it all that wonderful, dreamlike beauty which 



bathes the isles in a flood of golden light, and puts 
upon sea and land a veil as of ineffable mystery." 
The example is a typical one, and illustrates the 
haunting beauty that may be given a simple sentence 
by the harmonious collocation of a few congruous 
epithets and the melodious arrangement of a few 
vowel-sounds. Miss Macleod's story is in keeping 
with her style ; it is an exquisitely-wrought study, 
rich in imaginative quality, and touched with enough 
of passion to give it life. It is something like the 
work of " Loti " at his best, with the Celtic dimness 
of atmosphere, the Celtic sense of the brooding fate 
that shapes the lives of men. 

Another sharp contrast is offered by " The Car- 
issima," the next book upon our list. Here, too, 
there is something of the sense of brooding or im- 
pending fate, but the effect is grotesque (as the au- 
thor clearly intends it to be) rather than tragic. The 
book is a study of character, as exhibited by a group 
of five or six people summering together in a Swiss 
hotel. The analysis is extremely well done, so well, 
in fact, that the occasional interpositions of the 
writer for the purpose of explaining her characters 
are quite unnecessary, and rather irritate than help 
the reader. The heroine is a very modern young 
woman, and one is likely at the end to agree with 
the opinion expressed by the speaker in the " Pro- 
logue," that " compared with even a superficial com- 
prehension of the intricacies of her thought and 
conduct, the mastery of the Chinese language would 
supply an airy pastime, the study of the higher 
mathematics a gentle sedative." The interest of 
the story as a whole is considerable and is well sus- 
tained, but its real strength lies in the finish of the 
workmanship, in the innumerable touches of humor, 
of epigrammatic wisdom, and even of cynical ob- 
servation, with which its pages sparkle. It is a ripe 
book, but with the flavor of the hot-house, and the 
suggestion of what come after ripeness, both to fruit 
and to society. 

The reader of "Tomalyn's Quest" should be 
prepared for all sorts of surprises. The writer has 
evidently made it a point of honor that the interest 
of his story should never be allowed to lag, and it 
never does. Tomalyn is an ingenuous young En- 
glishman who goes to Constantinople as private sec- 
retary of one Tompkins Pasha, an officer of the 
Turkish army. His quest is " experience," and he 
gets it in the shape of Russian intrigue, Armenian 
villainy, and the coquetry of a female spy who finds 
him an easy victim. The story is really very graphic 
and entertaining, although it strains credulity now 
and then, most of all, perhaps, when in the end the 
beautiful but wicked heroine, in an hour of impulsive 
penitence, allows her skin to be transplanted to an- 
other face for a consideration. This is, to say the 
least, a startling way of smoothing matters for Tom- 
alyn, since the other face is that of the heroine's 
rival, who is (before the operation) good but not 
beautiful. The book is well provided with local 
color, which is applied with boldness and an eye for 
artistic effect. We are many times reminded of 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

Mr. Kipling's methods of treatment and characteri- 
sation, which statement is perhaps the most illumi- 
nating one that may be made in so brief a review 
as this. 

The amateur detective story will always have its 
harm for the reader who looks to a story-book for 
nothing more than diversion or recreation, and the 
variations to be played upon this theme are prac- 
tically inexhaustible. Mr. Kernahan's " Captain 
Shannon " is a capital book of its kind, and tells of 
an Irish dynamiter, finally run to earth after hav- 
ing committed several outrages and caused the 
death of some hundreds of innocent people. If the 
reader be not too critical of details, and have not 
too keen an eye for the minor points of construction, 
we can assure him that this novel will provide an 
hour or two of acceptable entertainment, and more 
than that the author never intended to provide. 

If Mr. Rider Haggard ventures to tempt fortune 
with many more books of the sort that he has given 
us of late, he will lose the slight claim he has hith- 
erto had to be considered seriously. " The Wizard," 
the latest of his romances, is stucco-work of the 
cheapest description, and displays an imagination so 
poverty-stricken that we wonder at its publication. 
The theme is a fine one that of the conversion of 
a fierce African tribe by a missionary who pays for 
his devotion with his life but it is so handled that 
we never for a single moment experience the emo- 
tional thrill that might so easily have been made to 
accompany the presentation of such a subject. Mr. 
Haggard has in his day written about a great many 
tiresome savages, but never before quite so ineffec- 
tively as in the present instance. 

" A Court Intrigue " is the story of an English- 
man on a holiday in Brittany. Stopping for the 
night in an out-of-the-way place, he comes upon as 
queer a collection of people as could well be imag- 
ined. An exiled king and his followers are found 
in possession of a country house, where they have 
established themselves and set up a semblance of a 
court. The doings of these people are strongly sug- 
gestive of Alice in Wonderland, and the reader is 
not altogether unprepared to learn that the king is 
royal only in his imagination, being in reality a sim- 
ple lunatic, sent to this remote refuge for treatment. 
His followers are in like case, and all have been left 
to their own devices and delusions by the proprietor 
of the establishment, a swindler who has pocketed 
his fees and decamped. No such trifling things as 
probabilities are ever taken into consideration by 
the author of this story, and the work is a mere 
jumble of dull and incoherent episodes. 

" Life the Accuser " is an exasperating book be- 
cause it is so good in some respects that its defi- 
ciencies in others are glaring. For one thing, the 
author can write such good English, and is so con- 
scious of the fact, that she makes stylists of all her 
characters, whatever their condition in life. For 
another, she is absolutely without humor, and the 
sustained seriousness of her story is rather depress- 
ing. Then there is everywhere so strong an insist- 



ence upon the psychological, so evident a determina- 
tion to get into the deep parts of character and life, 
that description and dramatic action are sacrificed, 
and soul-dissection becomes nearly everything. The 
story is of English provincial life, and has a gray 
coloring not unlike that to be found in the novels of 
" Mark Rutherford." In spite of its faults, the book 
is well worth reading, and contains two or three 
scenes of singular power. 

There is no lack of excitement in Mrs. Hugh 
Fraser's " Palladia," but the incidents are strung 
together without much regard for symmetrical ar- 
rangement, and a sort of nightmare effect is pro- 
duced by this jumble of Balkan intrigue and English 
country life and oriental trickery. When the inter- 
est seems about to lag, a dynamite explosion or an 
assassination is introduced to enliven the situation, 
and all goes well again at least for a time. Pal- 
ladia, the heroine of this many-colored romance, is 
an attractive figure, and her character and fortunes 
give a certain unity to what without her would be a 
hopelessly incoherent series of episodes. The scenes 
in which the oriental prince figures display a con- 
siderable degree of insight into the oriental mind, 
and can hardly have been drawn from an imagina- 
tion unaided by actual contact with the life which 
they depict. 

Shall we never have done with historical romances 
of the Civil War and the Restoration? So many 
such have come to us during the past five years that 
we have lost track of the count, and here is Mr. 
Max Pemberton with " A Puritan's Wife," which 
again fixes our attention upon the period in question, 
and again strings together a lengthy series of adven- 
tures and escapes. The year is that of the Plague, 
and the hero is a Cromwellian refugee who has re- 
turned to England, after five years of life in France, 
hoping that the hue and cry will no longer be raised 
against him. It is not a very successful story, as 
such stories go, and drags a good deal toward the 
close. 

" On the Red Staircase " is a well-planned and 
well-written story of seventeenth-century Russia. 
The scene is Russia, and the time is the exciting 
period of the childhood of Peter the Great. One 
gets an extremely vivid picture of the anarchy into 
which Russia was plunged by the contending fac- 
tions that sought for power after the death of the 
Tsar Alexis, and is at the same time privileged to 
follow the course of a romantic love-story quite ab- 
sorbing in its interest. The quality of the narrative 
is a little thin, but it has abundant action, and the 
plot is deftly worked out to a satisfactory conclusion. 

"White Aprons" is a pleasing romance of the 
Old Dominion, the date being 1676, and the histor- 
ical setting being provided by the episode of Bacon's 
rebellion against Governor Berkeley. The book is 
essentially a love-story, and its interest centres about 
a young follower of Bacon, who, after the death of 
his leader and the suppression of the revolt, is sen- 
tenced to death. His sweetheart thereupon makes 
bold to cross the seas, and solicit a pardon from the

King. As she conveniently happens to be a niece of 
one Samuel Pepys, her brief stay in London is full 
of incident, and brings her into contact with Dry- 
den, the Duke of Buckingham, and Mr. Godfrey 
Kneller. The latter even paints her portrait, which, 
we are assured, may still be seen in the National 
Gallery. We should add that her head is not turned 
by all these attentions, and that she returns with the 
royal pardon just in time to save her lover from the 
hangman. The story is charmingly told, and shows 
an increase of strength over Mrs. Goodwin's earlier 
romance of colonial history. 

Miss Seawell's " A Colonial Cavalier " is a dis- 
appointment. It looks like a novel, but we speedily 
discover it to be nothing more than an account of 
George Washington's boyhood and early manhood, 
written in goody-goody style, with the moral stick- 
ing out everywhere. It seems to be intended for 
youthful readers, and they may possibly accept it 
for the sake of the fighting, but its language is too 
prim and stilted for them to find it really enjoyable. 

General Washington appears as a figure, although 
not very prominently, in Mr. George Morgan's ro- 
mance of the Revolutionary War. The Valley 
Forge period of our national fortunes is the subject 
of this story, which shows something of the seamy 
side of the American struggle for independence and 
of the factious spirit that mars the history of Amer- 
ican patriotism in those its darkest hours. As a 
corrective of such decorous chromo-history as Miss 
Seawell gives us, the book has a certain value, but 
considered as a romance, we do not know when we 
have read a more shapeless and incoherent produc- 
tion. It is almost impossible to follow the thread of 
the narrative, and quite impossible, we should say, 
to take a real interest in any of the characters. 

Still another story of this period comes to us, with 
" The Scarlet Coat " for a title, and Mr. Clinton 
Ross for the author. The story is in marked con- 
trast to the one just mentioned, for it is clean-cut 
in style and structure, and extremely interesting. 
The events leading up to, and clustering about, the 
siege of Yorktown, are the subject-matter of the 
story, and we are introduced to both Cornwallis and 
Washington. The love-story intertwined with the 
history is in charming taste, and altogether the book 
makes a distinctly pleasant impression.

Mystery of 
Cell-life. 



Biological research in recent years 
has been largely devoted to the struc- 
ture and activities of the cell. This 
unit of living matter has been explored for the secret 
of heredity and the key to the mystery of growth 
and differentiation. Professor Wilson of Columbia 
University has rendered a valuable service in pre- 
paring for the student and the general reader a crit- 
ical summary of the most recent work in this field, 
in "The Cell in Development and Inheritance," 



published by the Macmillan Co. in the " Columbia 
University Biological Series." An historical sketch 
of the cell-theory and a discussion of its relation to 
current views of evolution and inheritance precede 
the full treatment of the structure and organs of the 
cell and the complicated mechanism of cell-multipli- 
cation. The ultimate structure of protoplasm, the 
physical basis of life, is reviewed in the light of the 
investigations of Biitschli and Strasburger. Living 
matter is not a single chemical substance, but a 
mixture of many that are self -perpetuating without 
the loss of their specific characters. The open ques- 
tion is whether these substances are localized in dis- 
crete bodies aggregated to form the cell, as cells 
unite to form the body, and whether these ultimate 
particles, if they exist, lie within the reach of the 
microscope. The chapters which deal with the sub- 
ject of the sex-cells, their intimate structure, and 
the phenomena which precede, attend, and follow 
their union in offspring, will be of prime interest to 
the lay reader who wishes to gain an understanding 
of the basis and bearings, the strength and the weak- 
ness, of Weismann's theory of heredity. The chem- 
ical relations and the physiological activities of the 
cell receive passing notice. The book closes with a 
discussion of the broader problems that lie at the 
outposts of cell research. What is the guiding prin- 
ciple of development that correlates its complex 
phenomena to a definite end ? This unknown factor 
in development is involved in the structure of the 
germ plasm inherited from foregoing generations ;. 
but what this structure is, and how it has been ac- 
quired, are at present beyond our ken. Despite all 
our theories, we no more know how the properties 
of the germ plasm involve those of the adult, than 
we know how the properties of hydrogen and oxygen 
involve those of water. The study of the cell has 
widened rather than narrowed the enormous gap 
that separates the lowest forms of life from the inor- 
ganic world. A popular treatment, a pleasing style, 
abundant illustrations, and a full glossary assist the 
uninitiated reader of this volume to an understanding 
of the technical side of the topics discussed. No 
single book better illustrates the trend of biological 
investigation in the past decade. 

Another volume in the " Columbia 
Study of Fi*he, University Biological Series "is by 

hvtng and fossil. -TV-DU/J-TV t. U't' 

Dr. Bashford Dean, whose subject is 
" Fishes, Living and Fossil." Dr. Dean has given 
a very accurate and readable account of the struc- 
ture and evolution of the outlying and ancestral 
types of the fishes. The chapters relating to the 
lampreys, sharks, and their fossil allies, are thor- 
oughly excellent, and the account of the develop- 
ment of the organs of fishes is in general very sat- 
isfactory. The chief criticism that suggests itself 
lies in the expectations aroused by the title. The 
typical fishes, or Teleosts, including ninety-five per 
cent of the existing species of aquatic vertebrates, 
are very inadequately treated. Among the true 
fishes are very great modifications of form and struc-

ture, and many notable lines of evolution, of which 
this work gives scarcely a suggestion. The true 
fishes are treated* by Dr. Dean as constituting a 
single order, within the limits of which no essential 
variety is observed, except certain oddities produced 
by peculiar conditions of environment. No refer- 
ence of importance is made to the taxonomy of the 
bony fishes, or to the anatomical studies on which 
their classification rests. In the Bibliography, the 
references to the embryology and anatomy of the 
lampreys, sharks, and lung-fishes are very complete 
and accurate ; but that on the bony fishes is very 
far from sufficient, many of the most important 
memoirs being omitted as, for example, Professor 
Cope's memoir on the osteological characters of the 
orders of fishes in a paper on the " Fishes of the 
Lesser Antilles." So far as taxonomy is concerned, 
the references are almost valueless. Thus, of some 
three hundred papers by Dr. Gill we have reference 
only to one popular article. Jordan and Gilbert's 
elaborate " Synopsis of the Fishes of North Amer- 
ica" is superseded by "Jordan and Guilbert : Manual 
of the Vertebrates of Eastern N. A., McClurg, Last 
Edition," an elementary treatise with which Dr. 
Gilbert has had nothing to do. The work is, as 
indicated by the author, but "an introductory study "; 
and the general work which shall do justice to the 
structure, evolution, and classification of the true 
fishes, is yet to be written. 

Foundations The foundation of the modern science 

of modem of Ichthyology rests on Dr. Albert 

Giinther's Catalogue of the Fishes of 
the British Museum (eight volumes, 1859 to 1870). 
With all its faults and these are many this 
monumental work has been of inestimable service 
to every student of fishes, and it has been the key- 
stone to the science of which it treats. The Second 
Edition of this Catalogue, under the hands of Dr. 
G. A. Boulenger, promises to mark as great an ad- 
vance over the work of Dr. Gttnther as GUnther's 
work marked over the chaos that preceded it. 
Dr. Boulenger brings to his task a thorough train- 
ing in the discrimination of species, a sound judg- 
mentj a freedom from personal or national preju- 
dices, and an accuracy in detail which places him 
in the very front rank of taxonomists. So far as 
any man can say the last word in matters of this 
kind, he is prepared to say it. Every part of the 
work shows the most conscientious application, and 
if the author is spared to finish this task he will have 
placed his name as an ineffaceable stamp on the his- 
tory of every group of fishes. A feature of especial 
value is in the attention given to the osteology, on 
which classification in this group must ultimately 
rest. Dr. Boulenger has been generous in his recog- 
nition of the work of others. Concerning American 
fishes, he says : " It is especially in North American 
Ichthyology, which was in an utterly confused state 
when the First Edition of this work was prepared, 
and when no materials were available in any Euro- 
pean museum, that the greatest progress has been

Felix. 



made, thanks chiefly to the untiring energy of Pro- 
fessor Jordan and his associates, Professors Gilbert 
and Eigenmann. All this excellent work of revision 
of the earlier systematic attempts has greatly facili- 
tated my task." In style and typography, Boulen- 
ger's Catalogue is a model. It is gratifying to note, 
at a time when the activity of naturalists is being so 
largely directed into other channels, that systematic 
zoology is represented by one of the noblest pieces of 
scholarship since animals were first ranged in order. 

Mr. Du Maurier lost a chance when 
he did not call his second novel " In 
Bohemia without Moscheles." Pos- 
sibly that title would not have appealed to the pub- 
lic a few years ago, but it would do so now ; and as 
to posterity, we will leave the matter open. As for 
the work now in hand, " In Bohemia with Du Mau- 
rier " (Harper), by Felix Moscheles, we know of noth- 
ing quite equal to it, except the book which Shan- 
don wanted Captain Sumph to get together from his 
experiences, Captain Sumph, who began, " I re- 
member poor Byron, Hobhouse, Trelawney, and 
myself." We have here a sufficient reason for Du 
Maurier's having omitted Mr. Moscheles where he 
inserted Mr. Whistler. To speak of the matter seri- 
ously, however, it is a pity that somebody did not 
persuade Mr. Moscheles to make simply a book out 
of his collection of Du Maurier's early caricatures, 
and then to print it privately for a few friends. They 
are not the best of caricatures, but we suppose every 
line of a master ought to be preserved, though surely 
everything need not be popularised. As it was, Mr. 
Moscheles endeavored to use the sketches as illus- 
trations of his own reminiscences, a matter wherein 
his powers are fatally handicapped by comparison. 
His companion in Bohemia did have precisely the 
gift necessary to put into actual forms his recollec- 
tions of the past, and to make them roseate and of 
a glamour charming to the world. This power Mr. 
Moscheles lacks ; and hence his reminiscences are 
not such as to make us wholly sympathize in his 
delight in recollection. We might quote many pas- 
sages to give an idea of his manner, but we believe the 
distilled quintessence may be found in the following : 
" These occasions were productive of a great num- 
ber of drawings and sketches, illustrating our little 
adventures, and all plainly showing that the inci- 
dents recorded occurred to us at that pleasant time 
of life when bright illusions and buoyant spirits lead 
the way, and when sorrow itself has more of the 
rose-colour than many a rose of later day " (p. 45). 
What a funny Bohemia it must have been while he 
was in it, and how Du Maurier must have enjoyed 
being with him ! 

Mr. Stuart Henry's " Hours with 
? amous Parisians" (Way & Will- 
iams) fills a long-felt want. It is a 
translation, or say a paraphrase, of " Nos Contem- 
porains chez Eux " those photographs of famous 
Parisians sitting overwhelmed by their home sur- 
roundings, which used to be common in the shop-

windows of Paris, and may be still. For instance, 
in the photograph you saw Verlaine sitting in a cafe 
with absinthe before him ; so does he appear in the 
book. Really, however, Mr. Henry has not para- 
phrased the photographs be has vitascoped them ; 
the famous Parisians move about and do character- 
istic things. In the photograph Verlaine always 
sits with his head thrown back and a kind of blink. 
In the book we have just the same background, but 
Verlaine wakes up, writes poems, limps, looks at 
Mr. Henry, and finally "moves out of the front 
door." Such is the power of words, as was long 
since discovered by Lessing; they are infinitely 
more amusing than photographs. Mr. Henry shows 
us interiors devoted to M. Zola, M. Anatole France, 
Mile. Yvette Guilbert, M. Bougereau, and many 
another of whom we have often heard, and we see 
just who and what they are. This marvel he accom- 
plishes partly by his mastery of style. Mr. Henry 
has captured for himself the modern style, the 
curiosa felicitas style which we have all admired 
from a distance : he has lassoed it and removed 
enough verbs to prevent its escape, and then has 
made it his own by inoculating it with a mixture of 
Gallicisms and French words. He is almost a con- 
temporary N. P. Willis (though not quite), and 
therefore very amusing. He gives no literary infor- 
mation as such, but conveys an excellent idea of the 
men of letters, as of the others, by means more 
agreeable and cleverer. In fact, in this respect the 
book is almost as good as " Letters to Dead Au- 
thors." So it fulfils every requisite : it deals with 
matters we all long to know about, it deals with 
them to most satisfying results ; and then its style 
we cannot somehow get away from that lovely 
style. Madame Bernhardt " ripples forth in a key 
of lyric and pearl : JSonjour, monsieur." It is a 
most delightful book : the chosen few will appreci- 
ate it at its real worth, and the unelect will read it 
with immense interest and edification. No one need 
avoid it. Mr. Henry allows himself to neglect some 
of the directions of the activity of M. Catulle Monde's 
although it must be confessed that he does give rather 
an adequate idea of the masterpiece of M. Marcel 
Prvost. 

We will own to feeling somewhat 
<g8ted on finding that the books 
which whiled away Sir Herbert Max- 
well's "Rainy Days in a Library" (Francis P. 
Harper) were books of which we had heard not even 
the names. Our chagrin was somewhat lightened 
when we discovered, on going on, that some of the 
books were really not unknown to us, and that it 
was very pleasant to make acquaintance with the 
rest. The author of these papers thinks that many 
books which delight us when we read in bed would 
not do so well for sober daylight. But even in 
broad day there are times when one wants merely 
to be amused and " seduced into caprice." A wet 
morning in a country-house library, at such a time 
and place one appreciates things otherwise regarded 



as perhaps too trivial. In these thirteen papers we 
have something on as many books ; a little com- 
ment, a few extracts, and all good. As to the best 
thing in the book, it is hard to decide between the 
remedy for the scorpion's bite in Jonson's "Wonder- 
ful Things of Nature," " If he [the person bitten] 
sit upon an Asse with his face toward the tayl, the 
Asse will endure the pain and not he," between 
this unkind remedy and the piece of folk-lore re- 
ported from Brazil in Blaeu's Atlas, to the effect 
that " the newly-married couple occupy a hammock 
of network ; the father of either of them takes the 
opportunity of their slumber to cut with a sharp 
stone the cord suspending it a necessary precau- 
tion, as they believe, to prevent the future progeny 
having tails, which but for this operation they would 
naturally have." Sir Herbert is a man of humor 
and of scholarship ; perhaps his good traits are fur- 
ther explained by his appreciation of sport and 
sports it goes without saying that he appreciates 
golf. And although the books that please him and 
us are not, so far as this collection is concerned, 
sporting books, yet there is in his dealing with them 
that fine temper that comes from a due admixture 
of the study and the open world. So we commend 
the book to readers who want to pass a rainy day, 
and yet have not at hand either Adam Petrie's 
" Rules of Good Deportment," Bulwer's "Artificial 
Changeling," or " The Acts of the Scottish Parlia- 
ment." 



A readable 
text-book 
on Rhetoric. 



Text-books in English rhetoric and 
composition have so multiplied of re- 
cent years that a new candidate for 
favor must possess extraordinary merit if its publi- 
cation is to find justification. Such merit is, how- 
ever, disclosed by an examination of the " Construc- 
tive Rhetoric " (Holt) just put forth by Professor 
Edward Everett Hale, Jr. The word " construc- 
tive " strikes the keynote of the book ; for the au- 
thor never loses sight of the fact that men should 
study rhetoric to learn the art of acceptable writing, 
rather than to acquire a smattering of linguistic 
science or even to fortify the culture with a body of 
sesthetical canons. So we find in the present trea- 
tise exercises of all sorts and in great abundance, 
exercises that have stood the test of class-room work 
and given ample proof of their helpfulness to both 
teacher and student. We have never seen a more 
stimulating and searching series of tests than are 
here offered, and the student who conscientiously 
works through them will get both a start and an 
impetus along the path that leads to the mastery of 
effective discourse. But the author does not let us 
forget that art is long, and notes that to do all the 
exercises in the book would mean the writing of 
only about twenty thousand words. " Anyone who 
would acquire a good style must write as much as 
that in a month, and so on every month for a good 
while. In other words, no college course will give 
much more, even in the way of practice, than an 
idea of how to proceed." Another thing should be

said of Professor Hale's book. It is the product of 
a mind so finely- tempered, so wide in its range of 
interests, and so quick to connect literature with life, 
that it is actually readable, just as a volume of 
essays is readable ; and we are inclined to think its 
pedagogic quality all the better for this fact. It is, 
after all, a little absurd that the books which pro- 
fess to teach the writing of attractive English should 
be (as most of them are) quite unattractive them- 
selves, and that because of their pedantry and exces- 
sive formalism of presentation. Such books illus- 
trate " the delicate sarcasm of print " far better than 
the one before us, although the author, too modest 
by half, applies this deprecatory phrase to his own 

production. 

The latest book The latest, and in some respects one 
on Southern of the best, of the many works on 

California. Southern California is the little vol- 

ume published by the Lippincott Co. with the title, 
"Two Health -seekers in Southern California." 
Though lacking the graphic descriptions and the 
picturesque effects that one finds in the more ex- 
tended and pretentious works of Mr. Warner and 
Mr. Finck, this book of a hundred and fifty small 
pages has the advantage of compactness and low 
price, and presents a good deal of varied informa- 
tion of much practical value to the prospective health- 
seekers to whom it is addressed by the two members 
of the class who have gone before and now send 
back this carefully-studied and instructive report. 
The two are Dr. W. A. Edwards, a Philadelphia 
physician, who has lived eight years in Southern 
California, and Miss Beatrice Harraden, who has 
lived there two and a half years. The latter's con- 
tribution to the work is slight, consisting of two some- 
what unrelated chapters on Southern California in 
general and on " Out-door Life for Women," which 
are well worth reading. The more substantial and 
scientific portions those dealing with questions of 
climate and health, as well as with many practical 
considerations of vital concern to invalids and others 
looking toward Southern California as a refuge or 
a home are contributed by Dr. Edwards. The 
facts regarding climate, evenness of temperature, 
etc., are very fully given, and supported by official 
tables ; and the showing certainly appears to justify 
the highest opinion of this favored region. The 
offsets and drawbacks in the case seem to be pre- 
sented with fairness, and with no attempt to hide or 
belittle whatever disadvantages may exist, and which 
in the nature of things may be expected to make 
even Southern California not quite an earthly Para- 
dise. Tourists to California, or the many persons, 
sick or well, who are thinking of going there some- 
time, may read the book with interest and profit. 

From the number of volumes on one 
or another phase of the history of the 
Christian Church, one would suppose 
that department of literature already full to over- 
flowing. It seems odd, therefore, to find a new vol- 
ume in this well-worked field put forward for the

purpose of supplying " an urgent need for a popular 
history of the Christian Church for English-speak- 
ing Protestants." The Rev. George H. Dryer, D.D., 
the author of " History of the Christian Church " 
(Curts & Jennings), evidently intends that stress 
shall be laid upon the word " popular "; his attempt 
is to provide a history to be read by young people's 
societies and to find a place in Sunday school and 
home libraries. In expressly addressing Protestants, 
Dr. Dryer's success in popularizing Church history 
must be looked for among the former class. The 
Rev. William Bright, D.D., who is Professor of 
Ecclesiastical History in the University at Oxford, 
has been an industrious and persistent writer of 
papers and reviews upon historical subjects, chiefly 
polemical. He has recently gathered up these arti- 
cles, and other papers written for like purposes, and 
revised and expanded them into form for a volume, 
which receives the title of the first essay, " The 
Roman See in the Early Church" (Longmans). 
The volume contains, besides, papers anent St. Am- 
brose and the Empire, Alexandria and Chalcedon, 
the Church and the " Barbarian " Invasion, the 
Celtic Church in the British Isles, and the English 
Church in the reign of Elizabeth. It is a valuable 
addition to a theological library. Doubtless the 
intention of the Christian Literature Company, in 
their series of " Ten Epochs of Church History," is 
to popularize a knowledge of that department of 
historical study. In every other respect but this, a 
wise choice was made in assigning the " Epoch of 
the Ecumenical Councils " to the Rev. William P. 
Du Bose, S.T.D., of the University of the South. 
The subject is treated by him from its philosophical 
side, its Christology, as he calls it. The book is 
likely to have a wide reading among theologians, 
and may be found provocative of some controversy. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The lives of Richelieu and Philip Augustus, in the 
"Foreign Statesmen Series" (Macmillan), are timely 
biographies. Everyone is ready again to read of the 
great cardinal who " made his master the first man in 
Europe but the second man in France," so that Mr. 
Lodge's book is justified of its appearance. The same 
remark is applicable to Mr. Hutton's " Philip Augustus," 
although for a precisely opposite reason. It is worth 
while to read of Richelieu because he is so well-known; 
it is worth while to read of Philip II. because he is not 
familiar at least to English readers. 

Prof. Israel Abraham's point of view in " Jewish 
Life in the Middle Ages " (Macmillan) makes his exhaus- 
tive study of the structure of mediaeval society among 
the Jews remarkably profitable reading. His thesis is 
that civilization is responsible for the Jew as seen to-day; 
that the Ghetto transformed him. He shows that in the 
early mediaeval epoch the Jew was a creature of con- 
siderable privilege and showed a tendency to cast in his 
lot with the life of the new nations then in process of 
formation. But the intolerance of the Church from the 
twelfth century onward, and the avarice of the strong 
monarchies which had grown up in France and England, 



160 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



finally drove him to defensive organization. He became 
a pariah in society; and the Ghetto, with its intricate 
combination of social, economic, and religious elements, 
was the result, out of which, as out of a crucible, the 
Jew came forth a different creature. 

The recent publication of the Gibbon manuscripts has 
directed some attention to the woman whose skill did so 
much to fashion (and to mar, as Mr. Frederic Harrison 
thinks) the autobiography of the historian in the form 
that it has hitherto had. This fact gives a certain time- 
liness to " The Girlhood of Maria Josepha Holroyd " 
(Longmans), a handsome volume made up, for the most 
part, of letters written by that brilliant woman during 
the last quarter of the eighteenth century. 

Sir Joseph D. Hooker has done a piece of good service 
to the history of modern science in editing the " Journal 
of the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks" (Macmillau). 
Banks was the companion of Captain (then Lieutenant) 
Cook in his first voyage round the world (1768-71), 
and his journal is of great interest, even to readers of 
the present day. It emphasizes, as the editor remarks, 
the position of Banks as " the pioneer of those naturalist 
voyagers of later years, of whom Darwin is the great 
example." The volume is printed in handsome, almost 
sumptuous, library style. 

Recent English texts include three numbers of the 
" Riverside " series (Houghton), all edited by Professor 
W. P. Trent, and containing, respectively, Macaulay's 
essay on Milton, Addison, and Johnson and Goldsmith. 
Professor Trent's work is always well done, and we can- 
not recommend these books too highly. Messrs. Silver, 
Burdett & Co. publish texts of " The Tempest " and " A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," both edited by Dr. Homer 
B. Sprague. " Macbeth," edited by Dr. John M. Manly, 
is a volume in the series of Longmans' " English Classics." 
Messrs. Allyn & Bacon publish " As You Like It," ed- 
ited by Mr. Samuel Thurber. Finally, we may mention 
a pamphlet of helpful " Analytic Questions " on " Julius 
Csesar," by Professor L. A. Sherman, published in Lin- 
coln, Nebraska, by Mr. J. H. Miller. 

The volumes that have thus far been issued in the little 
series of " Temple Classics " (Macmillan) are as dainty 
and charming specimens of bookmaking as could well 
be imagined. Paper, typography, and binding are all 
in the best of taste; and the editing, under the general 
supervision of Mr. Israel Gollancz, is judicious and un- 
obtrusive. Southey's Life of Nelson, Wordsworth's 
Prelude, Browne's Religio Medici, Swift's Gulliver's 
Travels, and Lamb's Essays of Elia, have already ap- 
peared in the series; and Malory's Morte d'Arthur, 
Bacon's Essays, and Florio's Montaigne in six volumes, 
are promised for early publication. The low price and 
general excellence of this series should make it even 
more popular than the "Temple Shakespeare," which 
has enjoyed a sale of over half a million copies. 

A beautiful specimen of Japanese book-making, and 
at the same time a work of considerable literary interest, 
comes to us from Tokyo, under the title "Poetical 
Greetings from the Far East." The book is a small 
anthology of Japanese poetry, originally a German 
adaptation made by Professor Karl Florenz and now 
translated into English by Mr. A. Lloyd. The printing 
is on delicately tinted crepe paper, and each page is 
embellished with drawings by native Japanese artists. 
These designs are reproduced in colors, so beautifully 
printed as to have the appearance of being painted by 
hand. T. Hasegawa, of Tokyo, Japan, is the printer and 
publisher of this interesting and artistic little volume. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Professor C. G. D. Roberts has taken up his residence 
in New York, and associated himself with the editorial 
management of " The Illustrated American." 

Freytag's library, comprising over seven thousand 
volumes on the history of civilization in Germany, has 
been secured for the Frankfurt Public Library. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. have brought out a 
translation, by Mr. O. W. Weyer, of Richard Wagner's 
interesting novelette, " A Pilgrimage to Beethoven." 

Mr. Henry N. Ellacombe's " The Plant-Lore and 
Garden-Craft of Shakespeare " is now published in a 
handsomely illustrated new edition by Edward Arnold. 

The American students in Berlin arranged a Lowell 
anniversary celebration for the nineteenth of last month. 
Ambassador Uhl presided, and the programme included 
addresses by Dr. Alois Brandl and Professor James T. 
Hatfield. 

Mr. Laurence Hutton's "Literary Landmarks of 
Florence " (Harper) is the fifth volume in a well-known 
series of pleasant books descriptive of the haunts of 
famous people. Dante, Savonarola, Galileo, Landor, and 
the Brownings are its principal figures in this volume. 

The publication of " Modern Art," which for the past 
two years has been issued by Messrs. L. Prang & Co. of 
Boston, has passed into the hands of Mr. J. M. Bowles, 
who has been the editor of this excellent periodical from 
the beginning. Boston will continue to be the place of 
publication. 

Mr. James Lane Allen's long-expected novel, " The 
Choir Invisible," will be published this month by the 
Macmillan Co. Mr. Allen will be in Chicago, as the 
guest of the Twentieth Century Club, on the sixth of 
March, and will read a paper entitled " Seven Waves of 
Literature." 

" A Previous Engagement," a comedy by Mr. W. D. 
Howells, and " Six Cups of Chocolate," " freely En- 
glished " by Miss Edith Matthews from the German of 
Herr Schmithof, are two numbers of a new pamphlet 
series of drawing-room plays published by Messrs. Har- 
per & Brothers. 

" The Yellow Book " for January opens with a poem 
by Mr. William Watson, and continues with contribu- 
tions by Mr. Henry James, Mr. Henry Norman, Mr. 
Kenneth Grahame, Miss Evelyn Sharp, Dr. Richard 
Garnett, and other good writers. The " art " of this 
volume is varied, but not particularly striking. 

Dr. W. H. Tolman, Secretary of a Mayor's Committee 
of New York City, has issued an admirable " Report on 
Public Baths and Public Comfort Stations." He gives 
the history of the movement to establish and maintain 
public bath-houses, laundries, lavatories, and comfort 
stations, in Europe and at home. The report should be 
in every public library, and in the hands of advocates of 
sanitation and morality in towns. 

No more fitting memorial of a great scholar could 
possibly be planned than the library which it is pro- 
posed to place in the English Department of Harvard 
University in honor of the late Professor Child. Sub- 
scriptions to the amount of nearly ten thousand dollars 
for the endowment of this Library have already been 
received, and the amount should be materially increased. 
Only the income of the endowment will be expended for 
the purchase of books. Mr. J. H. Gardiner, Cambridge, 
will be glad to receive gifts of either money or books 
for this worthy object.

TO CHRISTIAN WRITERS.

$1000.J FOR A STORY 



Desiring to secure a religious story of superior 
merit, we offer ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
in Cash for the best MS. submitted to us before 
September 1, 1897, and FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS for the second best MS., each to be from sixty thousand to sixty-five 
thousand words in length. 

PURPOSE OF THE BOOK. It is customary for Sunday-school teachers and officers to make gifts to their scholars at 
the Christmas season. This Company aims each year to take advantage of this by offering them, for the purpose, a book of 
superior attractiveness and merit one that will be unrivalled as a gift, and which will prove a powerful factor in elevating 
and moulding the heart and life of the reader. Of " Titus,'' 
our Christmas book for 1894, there have now been sold nearly 
one million copies. " The Wrestler of Philippi," published for 
the holidays of 1896, has had a very large sale. The $1000.00 book accepted we shall bring out for 1897. The $500.00 book, 
if one of sufficient merit in secured, will be published for the season of 1898. The book should help the reader to the best 
conception of this life and true living of it. It will be judged upon its literary merits and forcefulness for this purpose. The 
widest liberty will be given writers as to plot. 

THE PLAN. Each MS. will be given a number. A receipt will be sent to the author, stating the number assigned. All 
MSS. will be submitted (without authors' names) to three competent judges. Judges will not be asked to examine MS. written 
in pencil or otherwise improperly prepared. Payment will be made for the best two books received, without reserve, on com- 
pletion of examination, and not later than October 30, 1897. 

WHY UNDERTAKE WRITING. There is seldom such an opportunity offered a writer for both usefulness and gaining 
a wider reputation. Few religions story books reach a sale of more than five or six thousand. We can insure a sale of at least 
half a million. With such an incentive and purpose you should find greater inspiration in writing. If your book is not con- 
sidered the best, or second best, you will still have as good a chance as otherwise of selling it to some other publisher and 
most books are written and a publisher afterwards sought. For circular giving further particulars, address

NEW BOOKS. 

THE CHIEF END OF MAN. 
By GEORGE S. MERRIAM, author of "T~e Story of 

William and Lucy Smith," etc. Crown 8vo, gilt top, 

$1.50. 

This book is an attempt to show the nature and method of 
the spiritual life, as it manifests itself in new clearness and 
beauty after the old foundations of dogma and miracle have 
passed away. It is in part a rapid survey of " our spiritual 
ancestry," in the classic, Jewish, and Christian lines; it in- 
cludes an exposition of "the ideal of to-day," and it makes 
familiar and homely application of the new yet old truths as 
"daily bread." 

A BIRDS-EYE VIEW OF OUR CIVIL WAR. 

By THEODORE A. DODGE, author of " Great Captains," 
etc. With New Maps and Illustrations. Students' 
Edition, thoroughly revised. 12mo, $1.00 net. 
This is a new edition, at a popular price, of a book which 
has been accepted as the one single-volume history of the War 
for the Union which can be relied on as an accurate, clear, 
and impartial narrative of that tremendous struggle. 

Eighth Thousand. 
CHAPTERS FROM A LIFE. 

By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS, author of " A Singular 

Life," The Gates Ajar," etc. With 24 portraits and 

other illustrations. 12mo, $1.50. 

The Critic says that " the autobiographical harvest has been 
unusually heavy this year, and in certain ways one of the most 
interesting ears in the sheaf is ' Chapters from a Life.' " 

The Congregationalist pronounces it '* one of the most read- 
able and stimulating among recent volumes." 

Fifth Thousand. 
AUTHORS AND FRIENDS. 

By Mrs. JAMES T. FIELDS. 12mo, gilt top, $1.50. 

This book has been welcomed as one of the best and most 
interesting of recent publications. It contains reminiscences, 
anecdotes, and letters of Longfellow, Emerson, Holmes, Mrs. 
Thaxter, Mrs. Stowe, Whittier, Tennyson, and Lady Ten- 
nyson. 

The Real Joan of Arc. 

JOAN OF ARC. 

By FRANCIS C. LOWELL. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 
" The story is one of the most thrilling, pathetic, and pitiful 
in all history, and this without the legends which have gath- 
ered themselves about it. Mr. Lowell tells it in a manner and 
style which leave nothing to be desired." Boston Advertiser.

PEPPER, W. F. GIESE, H. A. SOBER, and others. With numerous Historical, Geographical, Ethno- 
logical, Bibliographical, Archaeological, and Biographical Notes. Illustrated by many Portraits, Maps, 
and Facsimiles. 

Edited by REUBEN GOLD THWAITES, 

Secretary of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin ; editor of " The Wisconsin Historical Collections," Withers's 

" Chronicles of Border Warfare "; author of " The Colonies, 1492-1750," " Historic 

Waterways," " The Story of Wisconsin," etc. 

The work is printed in large type, at the Imperial Press, on a special make of Dickinson's hand- 
made deckle-edged paper. About 60 vols., 8vo, of about 300 pages each; polished buckram cloth, 
uncut, top edges gilt ; price, $3.50 net per vol. The edition is limited to 750 numbered sets. Volumes 
are issued at the rate of one a month. Subscriptions only entered for complete sets. 

The publication will embrace: The entire series of original Cramoisy Jesuit Relations (Paris, 1632-'72). 

The Shea-Cramoisy Series of Reprints The O'Callaghan Series of Reprints and Facsimiles. Le Journal des 

Jesuites, publie par MM. les Abbe's Laverdiere et Casgrain (Quebec, 1871). All portions of Lettres Edifiantes et 
Curieuses that bear on the French Missions in North America. Carayon's Premiere Mission des Jesuites au Canada 

(Paris, 1864) Relations Inedites de la Nouvelle-France, 1672-1679 (2 vols., Paris, 1861). Many privately printed 

Letters and Relations, collected by Fathers Martin and Jones, Mr. James Lenox, and others. Much hitherto 
unpublished Material, from MSS. in the Archives of St. Mary's College, Montreal, and elsewhere Also several 
Relations (such as Bressaui's, 1645-'49) and other Documents not ordinarily cited in bibliographies of the subject. 

" The greatest literary event of the year will be the publication of the Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents. . . . The 
Jesuit Relations are the very beginnings of American History, yet they have hitherto been only partly accessible, even to the 
most learned and wealthy. . . . There are many collectors of Americana who would have cheerfully paid a hundred times 
the publication price for a half of what is now placed within easy reach of every historical library. . . . The old French text 
is excellently reproduced, even to some of its misprints. The translations are remarkably clear and idiomatic." Chicago 
Tribune (Jan. 16, 1897). 

"Some months ago we indicated its monumental character and the care taken to render it in every way worthy of its 
subject. The first volume quite equals our. expectation in respect to both editing and printing. Mr. Thwaites's general intro- 
duction is admirable. . . . The translation is exact without being awkward, . . . free from tedious detail concerning the 
professional aspects of the mission, and will afford entertainment to the lover of adventure who has never heard of Poutrin- 
court, or Biard, or Port Royal." The Nation (Jan. 9, 1897). 

" A series of books, famous beyond most others to American historians and collectors of Americana, ... a work at once 
monumental and indispensable to historians. . . . The volumes offer an excellent specimen of bookmaking, as creditable to 
Cleveland as it is surprising to New York." New York Times. 

" Admirably made volumes, . . . whose value to the student of American history it would be difficult to overestimate. 
. . . The difficulty of the undertaking can only be measured by those who realize the rarity and the wide dispersion of the 
sources from which the editor must patiently collect his material, and at the same time the historical perception and training 
which he must have in order to present it in a scholarly and scientific manner." Critic (Feb. 6, 1897). 

" Of the greatest value to the students of American history, and should be in every library of considerable size. Mr. 
Thwaites's editorship gives assurance of careful, scholarly, and judicious work throughout." F. H. Crunden, Librarian, 
St. Louis Public Library. 

"A work which it would be difficult to overestimate." J. H. Dulles, Librarian, Princeton Theological Seminary. 

"Such a work has long been needed by students of American history, and the present plan of publication will bring this 
invaluable mass of materials within the reach of many college libraries and individual workers." H. H. Adams, Professor 
of History, Johns Hopkins University. 

" Realizes all my expectations of the work, and I expected much. Your editor's knowledge in the field of history covered 
by these ' Relations ' is not surpassed, if it is equaled, by that of any other historian now living. Of the typographical features 
of the publication there is nothing but praise to be spoken. The most important historical undertaking of recent years." 
J. N. Lamed, Librarian, Buffalo Library. 

" The first volume shows a grasp of the subject that inspires confidence. The works are becoming more and more difficult 
to obtain, and it is impossible to secure them at any cost, so that so careful reprint must be of immense importance to the his- 
torical investigators, and the notes will throw a flood of light on the circumstances of the times in which the documents were 
written." Douglas Brymner, LL.D., Dominion Archivist, Ottawa, Canada. 

" We are fully prepared to say that the large promise made by its projectors makes it evident that we are to have here 
not only the most considerable, but the most important, addition to the shelf of accessible American history which has been 
seen for many years. The scheme is an honor to American scholarship, and the execution of it bids fair to bring high credit 
to American workmanship. It has been laid out upon a scale and is proceeding with signs of excellence, both literary and 
mechanical, which would add to the repute of the oldest and most resourceful of the publishing houses of the country." 
Literary World (Jan. 9, 1897). 

" Every library claiming any degree of completeness of its historical collections should have your translation of these 
works. Dr. W. Scott Hill, our most notable local historian, expresses to me the most enthusiastic commendation of your work. 
He has studied for the last ten years, with great care and diligence, copies of the original documents now in this library, and 
has read and examined your two volumes of the translation, so that his judgment in the matter is of great importance. I wish 
our libraries and historical societies might each be induced to purchase copies." L. D. Carver, State Librarian, Maine.

Charles Scribner's Sons' New Books 


An Important New Book by Donald G. Mitchell. 

AMERICAN LANDS AND LETTERS, with 90 illustrations. i2mo, $2.50. 

Mr. Mitchell's new book covers the literature of our country from Captain John Smith to William Cullen 
Bryant. The author has for many years made a special study of the fountain-heads of American letters, and 
this wide and intimate scholarship has combined with his personal knowledge of most of the great literary fig- 
ures of half a century ago to create a peculiarly understanding and comprehensive sympathy with his subject. 
The illustrations comprise a really remarkable collection of portraits and views, many of them exceedingly rare. 


J. M. BARRIE'S LATEST BOOKS. 

Two notable books from the pen of Mr. Barrie were published during the fall, each of them unique in quality and 
character. The first of these, " Sentimental Tommy " (Fifth Edition, 12mo, Illustrated, $1.50), has been characterized 
by Joel Chandler Harris as "A work of fiction as original as it is fascinating." The other book, "Margaret Ogilvy " 
(Fourth Edition, 1'Jrao, $1.25), possesses an equal interest, though of an altogether different kind. It is an affectionate 
and exquisitely delicate sketch of Mr. Barrie's mother, of which the New York Examiner says : " It is so tender and so 
sincere it seems almost sacrilege to praise its art." 


PERIODS OF EUROPEAN LITERATURE. 

Edited by Professor George Saintsbury. Each volume crown 8vo. (In Press.) 
In this important series, the purpose of which is to consider Europe as being, for intellectual and spiritual purposes, 
one great confederation, bound to a joint action and working to a common result, one volume is now ready : " The Flour- 
ishing of Romance and the Rise of Allegory," by Professor Saintsbury. Future volumes will be devoted to The 
Romantic Revolt, The Dark Ages, The Transition Period, The Later Renaissance, The Augustan Ages, etc., and will be 
written by Edmund Gosse, Walter H. Pollock, H. D. Traill, and other well-known writers. 


THE BUILDERS, and Other Poems. By Henry Van Dyke, izmo, $1.50. 

This book of collected verse will have a great interest to all Dr. Van Dyke's readers as the first volume of poetry that 
has come from his pen. The most notable feature of its contents is the title poem, which was read by the author as the 
commemoration ode on the occasion of the sesquicentennial celebration of Princeton University last October, and which 
was characterized by Prof. Edward Dowden as " a permanent contribution to English literature." 


AMERICA AND THE AMERICANS 

From a French Point of View. 12010, $1.25. 

" He has seen the surface of things so clearly, has painted 
it so skilfully, that he is sure to be widely read." New 
York Tribune.

MONTIJO*. 

By Imbert de Saint- Amand. 12 mo, $1.50.

ume an elaborate study of the history of France during the

MEMORIES OF HAWTHORNE. 

By his daughter, ROSE HAWTHORNE LATHROP. With a new Portrait of Hawthorne. 1 vol., crown 8vo, 

gilt top, $2.00. 

Every addition to our knowledge of Hawthorne is peculiarly welcome. Admiration for his genius has caused 
many a reader to wish for fuller information concerning him as a man. His daughter in this book gives numerous 
glimpses of him, especially as a father, which will be very gratifying. Her pride and delight in him will find 
sympathetic appreciation in a host of Hawthorne's admirers. Her charming book covers the family life in Salem, 
Lenox, and Concord; the term of Hawthorne's residence in Liverpool as United States Consul from 1853 to 1858; 
his years of travel in France and Italy, 1858-1860; and his last years in Concord, 1860-1864. 



THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 

A Study of the Monuments and Culture of Pre-Homeric Greece. 

By Dr. CHRESTOS TSOUNTAS, Ephor of Antiquities and Director of Excavations at Mycenae, and J. IRVINO 
MANATT, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor in Brown University. With an Introduction by Dr. WILHELM 
DORPFELD, a Map, Plans, Tables, and over 150 Illustrations, including many full-page plates. 1 vol., 
large 8vo, bound very handsomely, $6.00. 

This important book offers a reasonably complete survey of Mycenaean culture, and registers the most signifi- 
cant results of Mycenaean research down to the present time. Its illustrations offer the reader and student just 
the apparatus needed to vivify their appreciation of primitive Greek life and art. An Introduction by Dr. Dorp- 
feld, the eminent discoverer of Mycenaean Troy, adds to the value of the work. The volume is of the same high 
order as Schliemann's and Lanciani's works. 



A TRANSATLANTIC CHATELAINE. 

A Novel. By HELEN CHOATE PRINCE, author of " The 
Story of Christine Rochefort." 16 mo, $1.25. 

The " Chatelaine " is born in Europe, lives for some years 
in America, her husband and father taking part in the War 
for the Union ; later she lives in France, and her intimate 
friend is in the Franco-German War. The story is very inter- 
esting, well written, and promises to be as popular as " Chris- 
tine Rochefort." 

UPON THE TREE -TOPS. 

By OLIVE THORNE MILLER, author of " In Nesting 
Time," Bird- Ways," " Little Brothers of the Air," 
etc. Illustrated by J. CARTER BEARD. 1 vol., IGino, 
$1.25. 

Mrs. Miller devotes this book to birds that haunt trees and 
make the woods glad the hermit thrush, other thrushes, the 
crows, sparrows, swallows, wrens, woodpeckers, humming- 
birds, orioles, larks, bluebirds, and many others. 



THE SPOILS OF POYNTON. 

A Novel. By HENRY JAMES, author of " The Portrait 
of a Lady," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

This is a novel of English characters and scenes, told with 
the high perfection of manner and the fascination of style 
which mark the best work of Mr. James. It is one of the most 
interesting of that series of novels with which he has charmed 
all appreciative readers and enriched English literature. 



MISS ARCHER ARCHER. 

By CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM, author of " The Wise 
Woman," " Sweet Clover," The Mistress of Beech 
Knoll," Next Door," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
Mrs. Btirnham's large circle of readers will gladly welcome 
this new and very readable story. The scene is partly on the 
coast of Maine, partly at an old " bef ore-the-war " homestead 
in Virginia. Some chapters take in Fortress Monroe, Hygeia 
Hotel, and Washington. 



THE SPIRIT OF AN ILLINOIS TOWN and THE LITTLE RENAULT. 

By MARY HARTWELL CATHERWOOD, author of " The Lady of Fort St. John," " The Chase of St. Castin," 

" Old Kaskaskia," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

The first story relates to the Illinois of about two generations ago. The interesting narrative is lighted up 
with the charming heroine, the Spirit of the Illinois town. " The Little Renault " is a touching episode of Tonty's 
life in Illinois in 1680.

of the greatest interest to literary students generally.

SOUTHERN STATESMEN OF THE

By WILLIAM P. TRENT, M.A., Professor in the Uni- 
versity of the South. 12mo, gilt top, with portraits, 
$2.00. (Vol. XIII. in Crowell's Library of Economics 
and Politics.) 

Washington, Jefferson, Randolph, Calhoun, Stephens, 
Toombs, and Jefferson Davis are the seven statesmen 
whom Professor Trent has chosen as representatives of 
political conditions now forever passed away. His style 
is fresh and vigorous, his summing-up of events is clear 
and logical, and his fairness is beyond cavil. He has 
produced a really remarkable book, and has conferred 
a great obligation on all students of history who wish to 
read the past with unprejudiced eyes.

ROCKS, ROCK-WEATHERING, AND SOILS. 

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, 

Curator of the Department of Geology, United States National 

Museum, and Professor of Geology in the Corcoran 

Scientific School and Graduate School of 

the Columbian University. 
Fully Illustrated. 8vo. Just Ready. 
Dr. Merrill has taken up a hitherto much neglected line of 
work, and one which on both economic and scientific grounds 
is of the greatest interest and importance. He treats of the 
origin, composition, and structure of the rocks composing the 
earth's crust, the manner of their weathering or breaking 
down, and the causes that lead thereto, and finally, of the 
petrographic nature of the product of this breaking down. 
The work differs from any thus far published in either En- 
gland or America in its thorough discussion of the principles 
of weathering and its geological effects. Much of the matter 
given is the result of the author's own observations and re- 
search, and has never before appeared in print. The twenty- 
five full-page plates and many figures in the text are of more 
than usual excellence, and are in large part either entirely new 
or reproduced from the originals as they have appeared in sci- 
entific journals, not having as yet found their way into exist- 
ing text-books. The matter is so arranged that the book will 
be of value as a work of reference, and also as a text-book for 
students in the Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Sta- 
tions, while teachers and students in general geology or physi- 
ography will find it to contain much of interest.

This series is made up entirely from the original sources of 
American history, the records and narratives of men who wit- 
nessed and shared in the events which they describe. Ex- 
tracts, long enough in each case to give some idea of the 
writer's style, are arranged in a local sequence, so as to make 
up a general account of the times from the first voyages to 
the present day. To each volume is prefixed a practical In- 
troduction on the use of sources by teachers, students, pupils, 
libraries, and readers, with a bibliography of the most valu- 
able sources and collections. It is hoped that these volumes 
may aid in the proper teaching of and study of American his- 
tory, by putting within the reach of classes some of the illustra- 
tive material which supplements and makes more vivid the 
regular narrative histories. Every pains will be taken to make 
exact transcripts, and to suggest proper secondary accounts 
parallel with the narratives selected.

A WORD FOE MINOR POETRY. 

The flood of verse that is produced in these 
latter days, and that somehow finds its way into 
print, offers a subject for serious reflection to 
the student of literary phenomena. Nothing 
like it was ever known before, since there never 
before was a period in which mastery of the 
elementary technique of verse was so common 
a possession among workers with the pen. 
Every now and then we learn with surprise 
that some famous scholar, whose reputation 
rests upon strictly prosaic achievements, has 
often had recourse to the composition of poetry 
as a recreation, and has long been dabbling in 
the art of rhyme and metre unknown to any 
but his most intimate associates. A few years 
ago, Mr. Lecky published a volume of verse 
that delighted all of its readers except those who 
based their sapient judgment upon the a priori 
grounds that so great a historian could not pos- 
sibly have the poetical gift ; and it was only 
the other day that a posthumous volume by the 
late Professor Romanes showed us that the sci- 
entific habit of thought by no means precludes 
possession of the sympathies and the sensibili- 
ties that are requisite for the production of 
very acceptable verse. Even the dry light in 
which the world appeared to a man of Huxley's 
temperament did not prevent him from penning 
one of the most striking of the many poetical 
tributes evoked by the death of Tennyson. 
Then, besides the occasional men of eminence 
in other intellectual fields who from time to 
time surprise us in this agreeable way, there 
are the writers a very numerous host who 
have no other distinction at all, but who every 
year swell the list of those who must be reck- 
oned with when we estimate the choral forces 
of English song, far removed as they may be 
in both aim and achievement from the select 
ranks of the soloists. 

The existence of this choir invisible that 
is, invisible to the gaze of the general public 
is a fact persistently borne in upon the con- 
sciousness of the closer student of contempo- 
rary literature. The reviewer of books, in par- 
ticular, whose task it is to make some sort of 
assessment of from one to two hundred volumes 
of new verse every year, is acutely aware of 
this multitude of singing voices, and, unless he

be hopelessly committed to a standard of judg- 
ment impossible to apply in such cases, is bound, 
in simple fairness, to recognize the sweet and 
sincere quality of many of the notes sounded, 
although he knows well enough that these notes 
will never penetrate very far into the popular 
consciousness. If he be honest, his attitude 
toward these bards struggling to make them- 
selves heard will not be inspired by a fine Hora- 
tian scorn of poetical mediocrity so much as 
by the feeling that a good deal may be said 
in behalf of poetry that is not too bright and 
good for human nature's daily food. There are 
hours and many of them in our lives when 
we are content to browse upon the meadow- 
lands of song, and leave the peaks unsealed. 
Even the poets that dwell upon the lowest slopes 
of Parnassus may offer some food for our spir- 
itual sustenance. 

The term "minor poetry" is of compara- 
tively recent origin, and indicates a definite 
realization of the fact that there is a difference, 
not of degree merely, but of kind, between the 
singer of the age or the race and the warbler 
of the hour or the coterie. The distinction 
between the two is reasonably well marked, 
although in the nature of the case no hard and 
fast line of demarcation can be drawn. There 
are always some poets " on promotion," as it 
were, poets whose place we cannot quite deter- 
mine because of the heated controversies occa- 
sioned by their work. Whitman, for example, 
was for many years in this condition of sus- 
pense, and now, long after his death, it is quite 
impossible to say whether he is a minor or a 
major poet. Mr. Kipling may be taken as a 
living illustration of this uncertainty of classi- 
fication. Then there are occasionally mute 
inglorious Miltons, as far as the larger public is 
concerned, who nevertheless are both vocal and 
glorious in the estimation of the cultured few. 
But the distinction between major and minor 
poets is worth making, in spite of the difficulty 
of dealing with a few exceptional reputations, 
and it is coming to be seen more and more 
clearly that the minor poet has a mission and an 
utterance of his own ; or, to supply a concrete 
illustration, that Mr. Dobson is in no. sense 
a rival of Mr. Swinburne, but rather a worker 
in different materials, shaping them to different, 
and, in a way, to equally successful ends. 

If this position be well taken, it will follow 
that there is no reproach in the title of minor 
poet. We do not think slightingly of the blue- 
bird because it is not an eagle, nor do we wrong 
the singer of simple lyrics because he has been 



denied the power to fashion epics or dramatic 
tragedies. When we 

" Read from some humbler poet, 

Whose songs gushed from his heart, 
As showers from the clouds of summer, 
Or tears from the eyelids start," 

we are not justified in measuring him by the 
standard of Milton and Shakespeare, but should 
rather ask : Does he accomplish what he has 
sought to accomplish ; is there a natural bal- 
ance between gift and utterance ; has he power 
to stir the springs of emotion at his own spir- 
itual level and upon his own terms? Some 
years ago, Mr. Slason Thompson published a 
collection of the minor poetry that, in news- 
paper and magazine, had appealed to him for 
a score of years past. He styled his collection 
"The Humbler Poets," and was in conse- 
quence, we believe, the recipient of more than 
one indignant remonstrance from versifiers who 
thought themselves anything but humble. But 
the very fact that a "humble " or minor poet 
should be too proud to accept the ascription, 
proves, as far as it proves anything, that the 
remonstrant does not deserve the title of poet 
in any sense, that his aim has been so far mis- 
taken as to make his work relatively a failure. 

Speaking of the " hedgerow poems" of his col- 
lection, Mr. Thompson said fittingly : " There 
come hours to every lover of poetry when he 
wishes for ' some simple and heartfelt lay,' 
something that shall speak from out a mind 
feeling the everyday cares of life amid the mul- 
titude, and not from the heights to which the 
masters ' proudly stooped.' " Something of this 
feeling, expressed with more of elaboration, and 
based upoti more broadly philosophical grounds, 
may be found in the preface to " A Treasury 
of Minor British Poetry " (Arnold), recently 
published by Mr. J. Churton Collins. Here we 
are told that : 

" It is in the minor poetry of an age that contempor- 
ary life impresses itself most deeply, and finds perhaps 
its most faithful mirror. In the great masterpieces of 
poetry that life is_ presented in an ideal light, and in 
relation to ideal truth. What belongs to a time is sub- 
ordinated to what belongs to all time, what is actual to 
what is typical, what is local to what is universal. There 
is, moreover, in genius of the higher order a dominant, 
a despotic individuality which tempers and assimilates 
the material on which it works to its own potent idio- 
syncrasy." 

The author then goes on more specifically to 
say that in Langland, not Chaucer, " the En- 
gland of Edward III. becomes fully articu- 
late," and that neither Spenser, nor Shake- 
speare, nor Milton, completely reflects the En- 
gland of the period in which he lived. 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



175 



" It is otherwise with the minor poetry of any par- 
ticular era. Here for the eclecticism, if we may so ex- 
press it, of the great masters the age itself finds a 
tongue. For the voice which speaks in these poets is 
the voice of the nation, of the courtier, of the statesman, 
and man of affairs, of the scholar, and litterateur, of the 
Churchman, of the man of pleasure, of the busy citizen, 
of the recluse, of the soldier and sailor, of the peasant, 
of the mechanic, and of women of all classes and of all 
callings. What is moulding, what is colouring, what is 
in any way affecting the life of the time has its record 
here. Is the pulse of the nation quickened or depressed; 
are imagination and passion, or fancy and sentiment, or 
reason and reflection in the ascendant, is the prevailing 
tendency in the direction of simplicity and nature, or 
towards ingenuity and art, is the moral tone in society 
high or low, is the period a period of progress, or of 
decadence, or of transition, the answer to all this may 
be found, and found in detail, in our collections of minor 
poetry." 



A 



COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION 
OF POETS. 



It is amazing how few serviceable sign-posts or 
blazed paths the criticism of twenty-five centuries 
has furnished for the wayfarer in the realm of liter- 
ature. By dint of ceaseless comparison, the older 
writers have got established in some sort of rank, 
though this is always subject to revision ; but for 
newer writers we are reduced to the kind of phrase- 
ology we find in the margins of books in a public 
library, shadowy glosses which strive to stand up 
against the dignity of the text by the prop of exclama- 
tion marks. It is possible that criticism is a failure ; 
that we cannot analyze the charm of a poet, any 
more than we can dissect a beautiful woman and 
find out the secret of her power ; that the true atti- 
tude in either case is to say, " You are beautiful ; 
your grace fills my soul ; I love you ! " But the game 
of criticism is delightful, even if played without rules. 

Perhaps the most valuable distinction ever made 
in criticism is De Quincey's, or rather Wordsworth's, 
separation of the " literature of knowledge " and 
the " literature of power." That distinction is cer- 
tain though in many authors the line cannot be 
accurately drawn. Lessing's demarcation of the 
provinces of poetry, painting, and sculpture, is of 
course invaluable, and might be carried farther. 
Aristotle's " imitation of life " and Arnold's " criti- 
cism of life " both fail to serve us, the one being too 
broad and the other too narrow. In Arnold's case, 
indeed, it is curious to study the fluctuations of 
opinion about the chief good in poetry, which he fell 
into at various periods of his life. In the preface 
to his poems, he decries the care for expression, and 
declares for creative art, the description of noble 
actions, as the main thing to seek for. A little later, 
in the Essays on Guerin and Celtic Literature, it is 
mainly style that takes his fancy, " natural magic " 
and the like. Toward the end of his life he grav- 
itated to the " grand style," which, if definite mean- 
ing can attach to the phrase, seems to imply the 



impassioned utterance of great thought. Lowell is 
even more confusing. He is like the universe, in that 
he has his centre everywhere and his circumference 
nowhere. He is capable of laying down a half-dozen 
contradictory doctrines in a single essay, and leaving 
you to take your choice. Mr. Theodore Watts has 
tried to give us a distinction by which we may group 
poets in his 4< relative and absolute visions." But, 
alas, one suspects that all " vision " is relative. 

The main contention in modern criticism is in 
regard to the respective value of matter and form. 
A recent editor of Catullus says that " to conceive 
simply and express vividly is the whole end of art," 
and that " the secret of immortality can be learned 
better from Catullus than from anyone else." On 
the other hand, Goethe uniformly condemns the 
preoccupation with style, and decides that if one has 
something to say the rest will follow. Mr. Swin- 
burne selects one quality of expression rhythm 
and makes that the pivotal point : "A poet must 
sing." And so the whole question is a muddle. 

I can imagine a sort of deified schoolmaster to 
whom all the books of the world should be sent up 
for examination, and who, after turning over in his 
mind the component parts of good literature, should 
mark them accordingly. The first quality that 
would engage his mind would doubtless be expres- 
sion, diction, style, name it as you will. To a cer- 
tain extent, style is weight of matter ; for the gift 
hinges largely on the amount you can express or 
imply in little. But not altogether, in spite of the 
Goethean doctrine that if you have your matter 
ready the style will come. It will, if you are born 
that way. The girl who received from the fairy 
the gift of uttering pearls and diamonds every time 
she opened her mouth, probably did not differ greatly 
from her unhappy sister who could only speak toads 
and frogs. Lucretius describes his primordial atoms 
as of various kinds : some were round and smooth, 
and these, flowing off from each other, formed the 
air ; some were square and rough, and these, coal- 
escing closer, produced the water ; and others had 
little hooks attached to them, and out of these the 
solid structure of the world was built. Well, the 
gaseous, watery, and solid structures of literature 
are built up out of words which possess character- 
istics in common with the atoms of the Latin poet. 
My examiner would therefore accept style as the 
first necessity of literature, and might set down a 
hundred marks for perfection in it. 

The second requisite he would decide to be crea- 
tive power. Looking into this power closely, he 
would see that some authors are better in creating 
men and some in setting forth women. Still more 
closely considered, he would see that there are some 
great poets notably Lucretius, Wordsworth, Shel- 
ley who had little force in human portraiture, but 
had a gift of embodying universal nature in a sense 
which may be called creative. If, therefore, he 
allowed a hundred marks to the whole quantity of 
creativeness, he would assign a third of this number 
to each of the sub-divisions. He would remark, too, 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



that creative force seems to come from the heart 
rather than the brain, and that accordingly the great 
authors love their bad characters equally with their 
good ones ; and he would be inclined to mark very 
low those modern novelists who go on a different 
principle and seem to think that a large proportion 
of their personages ought to be in the penitentiary. 

The third requisite would be thought. My imag- 
inary critic would see that there is a difference 
between width of thought and depth of thought, 
that English literature is wider than French, and 
German than English. I suppose there is no stu- 
dent who has not remarked, on going from English 
to German books, that he had got into a wider 
horizon and one with windows in it. The critic 
would therefore divide his hundred marks for this 
branch into two equal parts. 

The fourth important qualification for greatness 
is mass, quantity. A single mountain may have the 
same height and be of the same kind of rock as a 
range ; but it would be absurd to make them equally 
important. 

Having settled his preliminaries, my examiner 
would proceed to put them into use. For this pur- 
pose, he might take up the four accepted masters of 
the world, and mark them in the various excellences 
he had proposed. And first, as to style, he might 
say to Homer : " You are still the enchanter of man- 
kind. Your verse is as musical and as picturesque 
as when it rolled and lived before the Greeks. The 
one dominating quality in your poetry is splendor. 
The sun never seems to set in the Iliad or Odyssey." 
And to Dante and Shakespeare, he would say : " In 
this you are his equals. Not any of those poets 
who have been specialists in style and little else, not 
Catullus or Keats, can match you." But on Goethe 
he would turn a melancholy eye, and say: "Well, 
sir, you see what comes of despising style. You 
have no style. On a plain matter, such as a song 
or a ballad, you do well enough, though even here 
Burns or Heine can beat you. But for the light- 
ning phrase, the wheel revolving so rapidly that the 
spokes disappear and nothing is left but a burning cir- 
cle, there you are nothing. And your whole works, 
great as they are, are as formless as polyps. No, 
your three brothers must each get the mark of per- 
fection, one hundred, for this business ; but you can 
consider yourself lucky if I put you down for fifty." 

Taking up the question of creative power, he 
would say to Homer : " You had the luck to come 
first, and you are credited with having named the 
sons of men. But, honestly, you have omitted a 
vast number. The whole tribe of comedy escaped 
you. Humor knows you not. Imagine a world 
without Falstaff , or Don Quixote, or Tartuffe ! Still, 
if you do not run in every race you are first where 
you compete ; there is no other such splendid image 
of youth in literature as Achilles, and your Nausicaa 
is the clearest, freshest girl in poetry. Take twenty- 
five each for men and woman. There remains your 
embodiments of nature. You are not a master of 
incarnation in this kind, as is Lucretius or Shelley, 



but of the four I am considering you give the broad- 
est, most elemental effects. Twenty-five again." 
Then, turning to Dante, he would say : " Your men 
are tremendous, and your women the most intense 
and concentrated figures the world knows. You 
paint the night of nature rather than its day, and 
only as night or twilight is more monotonous than 
day are you inferior to Homer. Take ninety for 
your total for creative power." Then to Shake- 
speare : " You are unequalled in scope and variety 
in all art. Your women have been reproached for 
sameness ; but 't is a wide range from Cleopatra to 
Lady Macbeth, from Lady Macbeth to Constance, 
from Constance to your innumerable individualized 
young girls. You paint nature as a background to 
humanity. All in all, you must take the same mark 
as Dante." Last, he would say to Goethe : " You, 
sir, have painted a dozen women, one devil, and 
practically no men none at least that an appren- 
tice would not be ashamed of. You have put off 
the wild demonism of nature, and altogether your 
mark must be about seventy." 

As to depth of thought, he would say to Homer 
as the Egyptian priest did to Solon : " You Greeks 
are children. The Scandinavian skalds were pro- 
found beside you. If shallow, your thought is wide. 
Marked seventy-five in this branch." To Dante : 
" You are the deepest of mortals, and the narrowest. 
Seventy-five for you also." To Shakespeare : " You 
possess in perfect balance the all-embracing and all- 
revealing thought." To Goethe : " You are as wide 
as the world ; all races and kinds of men speak 
through you. But they do not speak so powerfully 
as in Shakespeare. One hundred, then, for him ; 
for you, ninety." 

As for mass of important work, this factor, while 
a necessary element in greatness, is hardly of equal 
value to the other three requisites. My examiner 
would perhaps give fifty points to Shakespeare as 
the highest ; forty to Goethe, and twenty-five each 
to Homer and Dante. 

Here I would take leave of my competitive ex- 
aminer, if only for fear that his presumption might 
get me into trouble. But I cannot forbear tabulat- 
ing the above results with some others arrived at by 
the same methods, and so have done.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE TRUE CRITICAL ATTITUDE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Everyone was relieved when it appeared, from recent 
numbers of THE DIAL, that Mr. O. L. Triggs had helped 
your Whitman reviewer out of the pit which is ready 
for everybody who writes about Walt Whitman. 

When your reviewer has had one or two more escapes 
of this kind, he will be convinced that his own method 
of criticism is futile and that he must become absolutely 
and unswervingly absorbed. He will doubtless learn in 
time that to understand or appreciate anything you must 
surrender yourself to it entirely, and, for the time being, 
judge everything else by that one thing. As Mr. 
Triggs so excellently points out, there is only one way 
to criticise Walt Whitman, translate all life and all 
literature into terms of Whitman, and then express 
Whitman in terms so acquired. But Mr. Triggs might 
have added that this is the only way to criticize any- 
thing. Dismiss former standards, get wholly absorbed 
in what you are to judge, look at everything from the 
point of view so gained, and then express your views. 
This is the only true criticism of literature or of life; 
although I do not know that before Mr. Triggs anyone 
ever stated it quite so definitely. 

For my part, excellent as is his theory, I could wish 
that Mr. Triggs were a little more of a middle-of-the- 
road Whitmaniac in practice. I am thinking of those 
passages in his letter where he sees fit to explain Walt 
Whitman by references to Christ and Socrates, argu- 
menta ad hominem which I must take leave to call clap- 
trap. That is not absorption in Whitman. Whitman 
does not interpret himself by Christ and Socrates: he 
interprets them by himself; and so does Mr. Triggs, or 
else what he writes on Whitman criticism is pretentious 
rhodomontade. Let us not imagine such a thing. Mr. 
Triggs is a comrade of the right sort: there is nothing 
"cold, critical, disinterested" about him: although he 
does shrink from going to the logical length of his theory. 

I, however, have no such hesitation, and I beg space in 
your valuable columns to lay down the following truths : 

1. There is no such thing as criticism of Walt Whit- 
man (or anyone else), or, rather, if there is it is cold, 
hesitating, niggardly, judicial, negative, professional, 
and no one need consider it; or, more plainly, if you do 
not wish to take Walt Whitman on his own terms you 
must not read his books. 

2. There is nothing but appreciation, which must be 
deeply and widely sympathetic, without reservation, 
boundlessly enthusiastic, emotional, and various other 
things, in fact, absorption. 

3. There is (as everyone knows) but one Walt Whit- 
man: it is not so generally understood that, although 
he has a good many prophets, there is but one who is 
the true genuine article. EDWARD E. HALE, JR.

"LEARN" FOR "TEACH" IN TENNYSON. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I was much interested and instructed by Professor 
Brown's article in your last issue, on " Dialectal Sur- 
vivals from Chaucer." In one of his examples he cites 
the verb learn used for teach. I am curious to know 
what he would say if he found that same use in Tennyson, 
whether he would read that now mighty shade a 
lesson in English grammar, or call up printer and proof- 



reader for a scolding. I fear there would be little satis- 
faction in either case, for Tennyson's use of learn for 
teach in the passage which I am about to quote seems to 
have been deliberate and intended. In the second stanza, 
or division, of " Merlin and the Gleam " these lines occur: 

" Mighty the Wizard 
Who found me at sunrise 
Sleeping, and woke me 
And learn! d me Magic." 

I quote from the first English edition of " Demeter 
and Other Poems," 1889. In Houghton and Mifflin's 
Household Edition, complete, the word appears in the 
same form, apostrophe and all. It is a small yet singular 
matter, which perhaps Professor Brown can make plain 
or relegate to a dialectal survival. JO HN ALBEE

A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF AMERICAN DIALECT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

At a recent meeting of the American Dialect Society, 
a committee was appointed to supervise the reading of 
American books, for the purpose of collecting all words 
and uses of words not yet recorded in dictionaries. This 
is part of the larger work of the Society in gathering 
all dialectal material which represents spoken and writ- 
ten usage in America. Such material will be eventually 
incorporated, it is hoped, in a compendious American 
Dialect Dictionary, similar to the English Dialect Dic- 
tionary now in course of publication. 

The reading of American books for this purpose has 
already begun, but the committee desires to secure more 
volunteers for this great and important undertaking. 
The books to be read include especially all dialect novels, 
as well as dialect stories and sketches in magazines or 
special volumes. Besides, American books of all sorts, 
particularly books of early date, may furnish valuable 
material. Anyone who wishes to assist in the reading 
is invited to address the chairman of the committee, 
stating the book or books he wishes to undertake, or 
asking for assignment of reading. Such volunteers will 
receive a circular of directions, describing a simple and 
uniform plan of collecting and reporting dialect words. 

The committee hopes to secure the cooperation of 
teachers of English or other languages in colleges and 
schools, of clergymen, and of people of leisure who 
are interested in observing peculiarities in language. 
The assistance of all such, as well as of any others who 
are willing to undertake the reading, is earnestly solic- 
ited. The importance of such an enterprise need not be 
urged. The undertaking should appeal to all Ameri- 
cans, as contributing to settle the relations of English in 
Britain and America, and as showing the growth and 
development of the language upon American soil. Be- 
sides, the Dictionary which will doubtless grow out of 
the work of the Dialect Society will be a reliable com- 
pendium of American usage, useful not only to this 
generation but to coming ones. 

The committee in general charge of the work consists 
of Professor Benjamin I. Wheeler of Cornell University, 
Mr. E. H. Babbitt of Columbia, and the chairman, whose 
name appears below. Q. F. EMERSON.

Two NEW BOOKS ON WASHINGTON.* 



New books on Washington, if well written, 
are always to be welcomed. They show that 
interest is felt in the man, not only by authors 
and publishers, but by readers also, for without 
readers publishers would not publish books on 
such a theme or authors write them. We can 
hardly think of a sign more hopeful for the 
country than a well-grounded belief that the 
readers of the country, and particularly the 
young people of the country, are deeply inter- 
ested in the really great men that the country 
has produced. Our best educators are men, 
not dogmas, principles, or systems. The belief 
just referred to, the frequent appearance of 
such books as the two now before us tends to 
create or strengthen. If the present period in 
our national history is attended by the peculiar 
dangers that some people think, it would be 
hard to imagine anything that would tend more 
directly to make the nation strong to overcome 
these dangers than a general appreciative study 
of the life, character, and work of Washington. 

The two books referred to, while both good 
of their kind, are quite different in character. 
Professor Wilson's ten chapters bear the head- 
ings : " In Washington's Day," " A Virginia 
Breeding," " Colonel Washington," " Mount 
Vernon Days," " The Heat of Politics," " Pilot- 
ing a Revolution," " General Washington," 
* The Stress of Victory," " First in Peace," 
" The First President of the United States." 
These titles do not suggest a symmetrical, all- 
around work on their subject, but rather a series 
of studies of some of the greater and more 
interesting phases of the man. And such is 
the fact ; the volume is made up of magazine 
articles. While it is not what the author would 
produce if setting himself to the production of 
a life of Washington rather than to a series of 
effective studies of him, it is still well worthy 
of commendation to the reading public. The 
matter is well chosen, a sense of proportion is 
observed, and the literary workmanship is good. 
The book is rather rich in quotable passages. 

We have been particularly interested in the 
last study, which recounts how Washington 
strove to establish what we may now call the

& Brothers.

tradition of the Presidency. At present, when 
official dignity is sometimes forgotten and some- 
times remembered only to be condemned, this 
admirable chapter could hardly be too widely 
read. How much Washington's efforts in this 
particular direction had to do with making the 
new government successful, Professor Wilson 
hints rather than expressly states in the fol- 
lowing passage : 

" While he waited to be made President, he called 
upon every Senator and Representative then in attend- 
ance upon Congress, with the purpose to show them 
upon how cordial and natural a basis of personal ac- 
quaintance he wished, for his part, to see the govern- 
ment conducted; but the oath of office once taken, he 
was no longer a simple citizen, as he had been during 
those two days of waiting; the dignity of the govern- 
ment had come into his keeping with the office. Hence- 
forth he would pay no more calls, accept no invitations. 
On a day fixed he would receive calls; and he would 
show himself once a week at Mrs. Washington's general 
receptions. He would invite persons of official rank or 
marked distinction to his table at suitable intervals. 
There should be no pretense of seclusion, no parade of 
inaccessibility. The President should be a republican 
officer, the servant of the people. But he would not be 
common. It should be known that his office and au- 
thority were the first in the land. Every proper out- 
ward form of dignity, ceremony, and self-respect should 
be observed that might tell wholesomely upon the imag- 
ination of the people ; that might be made to serve as a 
visible sign, which no man could miss, that there was 
here no vestage of the old federal authority, at which it 
had been the fashion to laugh, but a real government,, 
and that the greatest in the land." 

One is glad to know that such writing as this 
commands the large audience of one of the 
great magazines of the country. 

The second of our two books excites a dif- 
ferent class of reflections. One of our best 
students of American history, the late Professor 
Alexander Johnston, after remarking upon the 
intense opposition that the Constitution of the 
United States encountered at the time of its 
ratification an opposition so great that the 
change of two votes out of sixty in New York, 
of five votes out of a hundred and sixty-eight 
in Virginia, and of ten votes out of three hun- 
dred and fifty-five in Massachusetts would have 
defeated it says : 

"It is not a little odd to notice how rapidly this 
intense opposition was supplanted by what Von Hoist 
has called ' the worship of the Constitution.' Within 
four years after its formation, and in the second year 
after its ratification, its original opponents had begun to 
pose as friends of the Constitution; and from that day 
to this the chorus in praise of its general scheme and of 
its details has been swelled higher by every minority 
which has found here its last and strongest bulwark 
against the power of the majority." 

Something like this might be said of Wash- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

ington. Nearly driven from the command of 
the army in 1778 by a politico-military cabal ; 
factiously and almost successfully resisted in cer- 
tain leading features of his policy as president ; 
maligned in office as few Americans have been 
maligned, and followed to the retreat of Mount 
Vernon in 1797 by a loud volley of vitupera- 
tion, he was no sooner in his grave than the 
opinion rapidly culminated which found its 
fittest expression in the famous phrase, " First 
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of 
his countrymen." Appreciation, in fact, went 
so far that long ago it became as treasonable 
for an American to question the supreme wis- 
dom and virtue of Washington as it was to 
doubt the absolute perfection of the Constitu- 
tion. And was not the Constitution a work of 
*' divine inspiration " ? Of course Washington 
does not stand alone in this respect. Think of 
Lincoln in 1864 and in 1897 ! Nor is the 
idealizing of men peculiar to our times or to 
the United States. Mr. Ford finds examples of 
it in the legends of the East, the folk-lore of 
Europe, and the traditions of the native races 
of America. He even assumes that the myth- 
ology which " the keen, practical American of 
to-day " creates is akin to the process that gave 
the world Jupiter, Wotan, and King Arthur. 
It is only in a very remote sense, if at all, that 
a parallelism can be said to exist between these 
ancient creations and our national hero. But 
Mr. Ford is nearer the truth when he says : 

"By a slow evolution we have well-nigh discarded 
from the lives of our greatest men of the past all hu- 
man faults and feelings; have closed their greatness in 
glass of the clearest crystal, and hung up a sign, ' Do 
not touch.' Indeed, with such characters as Washington, 
Franklin, and Lincoln, we have practically adopted the 
English Maxim that The King can do no wrong.' In 
place of men, limited by human limits, and influenced 
by human passions, we have demigods so stripped of 
human characteristics as to make us question even 
whether they deserve much credit for their sacrifices and 
deeds." 

It is no doubt true that the canonizing pro- 
cess has been more active for the last hundred 
years in the United States than in the old coun- 
tries of Europe, and for the best of reasons. To 
a degree, human experience is transmitted from 
generation to generation, and from country to 
country ; in a sense, the world grows old together. 
But there is good cause for thinking that every 
new people which attains to a distinct national 
existence and life, no matter how dependent it 
may be historically upon others, must have a 
little mythology of its own. Abused as the 
term may be, there is such a thing as a national 
psychology ; not only so, the birth of a new 



people or nation is accomplished in, or at least 
is attended by, a state of mind that is favorable 
to the idealizing process. The attainment of 
nationality is a great gain ; it has cost labor 
and sacrifice ; somebody must be entitled to 
gratitude ; the tendency to individualization 
points to a person or to persons as the proper 
recipients of this gratitude whenever the facts 
will at all permit it, such seems to be the 
nature of the process. In the present case, the 
great qualities of the man canonized facilitated 
the operation. 

We do not, therefore, think it so strange 
that " the keen, practical American of to-day " 
chould canonize his Washington and Lincoln. 
The time may come when he will cease to can- 
onize new heroes, but there is little occasion to 
think that he will ever uncanonize the old ones. 
Even such realistic books as Mr. Ford's will 
produce little effect upon the popular mind. 
And why should they ? The historical critic 
will say something about " the truth of history"; 
but it would not be hard to prove that the great 
national idealizations of history, so far from 
being sources of evil, are rather sources of great 
good. Mr. Ford is not of this opinion ; at least 
he asks whether, in the case of Washington, we 
have not lost more than we have gained, both 
in example and in interest. Holding that 
opinion firmly, he seeks " to humanize him," 
" to make him a man rather than a historical 
figure "; but he restores our confidence when 
he assures us that, as the result of his investi- 
gation, he thinks Washington greater than he 
thought him before he entered upon his " hu- 
manizing " work. 

We have taken so much space with these 
general reflections that little remains in which 
to speak of the book itself. We have found it 
distinctly readable. Under the heads " Family 
Kelations," " Physique," " Education," " Rela- 
tions with the Fair Sex," " Farmer and Pro- 
prietor," " Master and Employer," " Social 
Life," " Tastes and Amusements," " Friends," 
" Enemies," " Soldier," " Citizen and Office- 
Holder," the author groups a great amount of 
information, and largely out-of-the-way informa- 
tion, that is interesting and much of it valuable. 
Often this information is conveyed in the form 
of quotations from Washington's own pen. It is 
not impossible that some of the information con- 
veyed will be shocking to the old-fashioned wor- 
shipper of the Father of his Country, as when, 
for example, he comes upon the accounts of 
some of Washington's first ventures in politics. 
Mr. Ford also thinks it probable that Wash-

ington partially outgrew, in his more mature 
years, the disability that the Rev. Mason L. 
Weems accredits to him, of being unable at the 
age of six to tell a lie. But interesting and valu- 
able as Mr. Ford's book is, we hope he does not 
think for a moment that it really presents the 
true Washington to the reader's eye. He has 
gathered, with great patience and industry, a 
mass of very valuable material, which also he has 
worked up in good literary form ; but he does 
not present, and perhaps did not intend to 
present, any full or complete picture of the real 
Washington. A mass of disjecta membra does 
not constitute a man. R A> HlNSDALE> 



PARTY POWER IN EUROPEAN 
GOVERNMENTS.* 



In the recent literature of government there 
is a curious note of uneasiness. The old con- 
viction that autocratic power must everywhere 
yield to popular sovereignty, made effective 
through some form of the parliamentary plan, 
is becoming sensibly weaker. It once seemed 
just to estimate the maturity of any people's 
governmental institutions according to the de- 
gree in which they approximated the system so 
skilfully built up in England. As a popular 
impression, this has been largely due to the 
difficulty of gaining comprehensive views of the 
political conditions which obtain outside of 
America and England. Living in an intellec- 
tual atmosphere, filled, as it were, with the par- 
liamentary idea, it has been hard to conceive 
of a different state of affairs except as tempo- 
rary and transitional in character. 

By his volumes on " Governments and Par- 
ties in Continental Europe," Mr. A. Lawrence 
Lowell has greatly facilitated the comparative 
study of institutions and has thus supplied a 
much needed corrective. Mr. Lowell's work 
covers France and Italy ; Germany, including 
the Empire, Prussia, and many of the smaller 
states ; Austro-Hungary, and Switzerland. His 
method of presenting his subject requires a few 
words of explanation, for he has given us some- 
thing better than a digest of half a dozen Eu- 
ropean constitutions. He starts from the fact 
that it is often impossible to understand the 
actual operations of government without con- 
sidering many things not suggested by the 
mechanism provided in the fundamental law.

By A. Lawrence Lowell. In two volumes. Boston : Houghton, 
MSfflin & Co. 



Among these, he singles out the phenomena of 
parties, which he believes have not received the 
attention they deserve. His particular aim, ac- 
cordingly, is to study the relation of their de- 
velopment to the actual structure of govern- 
ment. For this purpose, after describing the 
chief institutions of each country, he enters 
largely into the recent history of parties and 
into the more significant features of party life. 
In his description of the political organiza- 
tion of France, Mr. Lowell has made unusually 
intelligible the causes for the peculiar Conti- 
nental distinction between private law and pub- 
lic or administrative law. A simple illustration 
will make the importance of this distinction 
clear. If in England or the United States a 
citizen suffers wrong at the hands of officials in 
the supposed performance of their duty, he 
may obtain redress in the ordinary courts. In 
most European countries, on the contrary, the 
ordinary courts have no jurisdiction over such 
matters, which are assigned to special adminis- 
trative courts. Writing of France, Mr. Lowell 
says that any attempt on the part of the ordi- 
nary courts to judge administrative acts, and 
thus pass on questions of public policy, " would 
be regarded as an invasion of the province of 
the executive." Thus there is in France " one 
law for the citizen and another for the public 
official." In explaining historically the con- 
trast between English and French practice, Mr. 
Lowell is led to discuss the growth in France 
of the doctrine of the separation of powers. 
While what he says is on the whole true, has 
he not misunderstood the reasons which led the 
Constituent Assembly in 1789 to proclaim, in 
the Declaration of the Rights of Man, that a 
society in which the separation of powers is not 
defined has no constitution at all ? From the 
debate, August 26, on this famous principle, it 
is evident that the leaders of the Constituent 
did not have in mind possible encroachments 
on the part of the judiciary. They were affirm- 
ing the doctrine in order to limit the power of 
the executive, not in order to facilitate its action. 
The words of the Archbishop of Aix are espe- 
cially significant. After remarking that unless 
the legislative power was separated from the 
executive a despotism would be created, he 
added : " The agents of the executive would 
never make laws except to their own advantage 
and would never execute the laws against their 
advantage." In other words, the men of 1789 
could not have had much sympathy with the 
exemption of officials from the legal conse- 
quences of executive acts. 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



181 



Mr. Lowell, in his chapters on Italy, dis- 
cusses the same legal distinction and the man- 
ner in which it renders easy arbitrary executive 
action. The Italians are even more inclined 
than the French to encourage government by 
ordinance. Parliament has, says Mr. Lowell, 
" a habit of delegating legislative power to 
the ministers." For example, the final text of 
the recent criminal code was not submitted to 
the Chambers at all, since they had authorized 
the government after the preliminary debates 
to complete and enact the code, harmonizing it 
with previous statutes. Indeed, there is in 
Italy a " marked contradiction between the the- 
ory and practice of government ; for there is a 
strong ambition to be abreast of the times and 
a general belief in the principles of personal 
liberty ; but the actual condition of the nation 
has made it impossible to live up to these stand- 
ards." 

The difficulties of parliamentary government 
in France are much discussed, and yet each 
new diagnosis is anxiously scanned, to discover, 
if possible, the source of the political evils 
which threaten the great Continental Republic. 
Mr. Lowell remarks that there has been in the 
Chamber of Deputies recently a tendency away 
from excessive subdivision into groups and 
toward the formation of two parties. It is the 
group evil which is largely responsible, of 
course, for the dangerous ease with which min- 
istries are overthrown. But Mr. Lowell has 
made the insecure position of the French cab- 
inet still more intelligible by his explanation of 
the influence of the committee system. The 
committees are chosen, in both Senate and 
Chamber of Deputies, by the various Bureaux^ 
each bureau having a member on every com- 
mittee, and two or three members on the large 
committees. As the make-up of the bureau is 
determined by lot, and as the bureau is renewed 
each month, it is obvious that any given com- 
mittee may be politically hostile to the ministry 
in power. The ministry may therefore be 
forced to see its favorite legislative measures 
amended quite without its sanction. It can 
rarely count upon continued friendly coopera- 
tion. And yet it cannot decline its responsi- 
bility in the initiation of legislative measures, 
any more than it can decline to be responsible 
for the administration. 

The admirers of the parliamentary system 
will get very little comfort from Mr. Lowell's 
pages on Germany. They have ordinarily been 
unable to believe that the glowing promises of 
the constitutional struggles of the past would 



be unfulfilled, and that Germany would long 
remain an administrative despotism. But at 
the end of his discussion Mr. Lowell concludes 
that " popular government in Germany is 
neither probable or desirable." He does not 
think ministerial responsibility is possible under 
existing arrangements. These give the Bundes- 
rath, a comparatively inconspicuous body, more 
actual power than the Reichstag, which does 
little except consider bills which the Chancellor 
and the Bundesrath have prepared. Since it is 
through the Bundesrath, as the council of the 
federated states, that Prussia exercises her 
supremacy, any attempt of the Reichstag to 
control the imperial cabinet and to overshadow 
the Bundesrath would seriously endanger the 
Prussian hegemony and would meet with deter- 
mined resistance. Moreover, as the chancellor 
of the empire has, with the exception of a por- 
tion of Caprivi's administration, been also the 
President of the Prussian council, he could not 
be responsible at once to the Reichstag and 
Landtag. The separation of the two offices 
would, however, and actually did from 1892 
to 1894, make the pursuit of a harmoni- 
ous policy in Prussian and Imperial affairs diffi- 
cult. 

Much that Mr. Lowell says about the minor 
governments of Germany will be new to his 
readers, since these governments are rarely 
described. His study of the race problem in 
Hungary is instructive. There is also a val- 
uable chapter on the practical working of the 
referendum and initiative in Switzerland. He 
finds the referendum rather unpopular.

MORE PSYCHIC RESEARCH.* 



The only serviceable function performed by 
Dr. R. Osgood Mason's work on " Telepathy 
and the Subliminal Self " is to give an oppor- 
tunity to those who care to know something of 
the observations and views of " psychic re- 
searchers " to acquire such information with a 
reasonable expenditure of energy. The author 
is perfectly convinced that telepathy, or the 
communication of mind with mind without the 
use of the ordinary channels of sensation, is as 
thoroughly established as the laws of the solar

system, and when universally accepted will 
prove as beneficial to man's conception of the 
universe as any of the great contributions to 
knowledge. Further, the subliminal self 
which is our ordinary semi-automatic sub-con- 
scious action separated out from the rest of our 
mental complex and elevated to the dignity of 
an alter and a better ego is the active and 
efficient agent in telepathy, in phantasms, in 
automatism, in hypnotism, and all the trans- 
cendental manifestations of our souls. 

This is the point of view of the book a 
point of view shared by a considerable number 
of mankind ; and granted its correctness, the 
account of the phenomena given by Dr. Mason 
must be pronounced clear, concise, and plausi- 
ble. From a scientific point of view, the work 
is extremely weak, and its tendencies perni- 
cious. " Psychic Research " is a conglomerate 
term including a variety of phenomena, some of 
which stand upon an entirely different footing 
from others, and the study of no two of which can 
be successfully pursued by the same methods. 
Hypnotism, dreams, and some of the phenomena 
of automatic action, have been thoroughly es- 
tablished by the same kind of evidence as led to 
the recognition and study of the various kinds 
of insanity. The evidence for telepathy and 
veridical dreams and phantasms is wholly dif- 
ferent in its logical force ; and, what is equally 
important, the interest in them is a funda- 
mentally different one. The interest in the 
study of abnormal mental phenomena is thor- 
oughly legitimate ; but the popular interest, 
which must be constantly fed by startling coin- 
cidences and nibblings at the occult, is in the 
search for transcendental laws that will bring 
back the days of miracles and reveal the secret 
passage to Nature's storehouse. This is an 
unwholesome interest. In Dr. Mason's book, 
as in most books of this kind, all these various 
phenomena are jumbled together and treated 
as though they were equally " occult," equally 
unrelated to other forms of knowledge, and 
could only be established by appeals to endless 
narratives by persons whose character is above 
suspicion, and who are perfectly certain that 
they gave no indications of their thoughts, and 
that no one could possibly know this or that 
detail of their lives, and so on, and so on. To 
this is added, for the benefit of the skeptic, the 
moral lesson to be drawn from the fate of those 
who refused to look through Galileo's telescope, 
and the fact that most great laws and teachings 
had a hard struggle for acceptance. The dif- 
ficulty with those who reason in this way is a 



totally perverse conception of the logic of sci- 
ence ; they fail to realise that their analogies are 
irrelevant because the logical problem involved 
in the several cases is utterly different. A car- 
load of evidence of one kind is not worth as 
much as a thimbleful of another kind. 

In still another way is the tendency of such 
writings as Dr. Mason's an undesirable one. 
He speaks of these investigations of alleged 
supernatural powers as the results of " the new 
psychology," as " experimental psychology "; 
and the notion is spread abroad that the mod- 
ern study for which college professorships are 
maintained is mainly concerned with such spec- 
ulations. The professor is supposed to be devot- 
ing all his energies to collecting cases of coin- 
cidences and ghosts and trance utterances, and 
the like, and is constantly assailed privately 
and publicly by wearisome and meaningless 
stories of commonplace coincidences, and by 
demands for explanations of personal idiosyn- 
crasies and experiences. Of course modern 
psychology deals with very different problems, 
and is founded upon very different methods 
and interests ; the psychological laboratory is 
not a seance hall ; and the psychic experiences 
are a great bore to the professor. None the 
less, the popular impression which, in our 
democratic environment at least, is not to be 
ignored goes forward that this is psychology ; 
and the interests of an essential and potent 
factor of modern knowledge are endangered. 
A popular interest in mental phenomena is in 
itself most desirable ; but the interest should be 
expended upon the significant and ever-present 
phenomena of our mental make-up, and not be 
wasted in sentimental strivings for the occult. 
Why exhaust one's energies in trying to fly, 
when the things of our desire are within easy 
access of journeys by foot !

the best that modern presswork can give. It will be 
interesting to follow the discussion of the works which 
may properly be placed among the classics of the lan- 
guage, especially when it comes to the consideration of 
prose. The edition will be brought out under the au- 
spices of the most competent literary authorities of the

AN ENGLISH WOMAN IN WEST AFRICA.* 



If a visitor from Mars should take a trip 
round our sphere, and on his return home 
should report his most important observation 
as to the state of affairs on Earth, this would 
doubtless be the fact that the people of one 
small corner are fast spreading over and sub- 
duing the whole planet. That the globe is be- 
ing Europeanized is certainly the most salient 
fact, and the most significant, of our time. This 
great migration and conquest, which has been 
going on for four centuries and may continue 
for four more, so dwarfs all previous historic 
events that even the extension of the Roman 
Empire seems but a ripple compared to a tidal 
wave. 

The continent which is now most exploited 
by Europeans is undoubtedly Africa, and hence 
it is a centre of interest both for what it is and 
for what it has been. Scientific observers feel 
that the indigenous life of Africa, animal and 
human, is about to pass away, or lose its prim- 
itive character ; and so all haste must be made 
to study the fast-perishing types. Miss Kings- 
ley enrolls herself as such an observer, when 
she announces in her book of " Travels in West 
Africa" that her "chief motive for going to 
West Africa " was to study " the African form 
of thought." 

The most important chapters in this book 
are those on Fetish. Here the author shows a 
thoroughly scientific temper, with much pene- 
tration and judgment ; and the result is a dis- 
tinct contribution to anthropology and specially 
to the science of religion. Her inquiries con- 
vince her that religion begins neither in the 
worship of nature nor of the dream-world, but 
" lies in man's misfortunes." 

" There can be little doubt that the very earliest hu- 
man beings found, as their descendants still find, their 
plans frustrated, let them plan ever so wisely and care- 
fully ; they must have seen their companions overtaken by 
death and disaster, arising both from things they could see 
and from things they could not see. The distinction be- 
tween these two classes of phenomena is not so definitely 
recognized by savages or animals as it is by the more 
cultured races of humanity. I doubt whether a savage 
depends on his five senses alone to teach him what the 
world is made of, any more than a Fellow of the Royal 
Society does. From this method of viewing nature, I 
feel sure that the general idea arose which you find 
in all early cultures that death was always the conse- 
quence of the action of some malignant spirit, and that 
there is no accidental or natural death, as we call it; 
and death is, after all, the most impressive attribute of

and Cameroons. By Mary H. Eingsley. New York : The

life. If a man were knocked on the head with a club, 
or shot with an arrow, the cause of death is clearly the 
malignancy of the person using these weapons; and so 
it is easy to think that a man killed by a fallen tree, or 
by the upsetting of a canoe in the surf or in an eddy in 
the river, is also the victim of some being using these 
things as weapons." 

This certainly is an interesting and suggestive 
point of view, and the whole treatment of the 
subject is worthy of careful attention. 

However, by far the most interesting por- 
tion of this book to many readers will be the 
graphic description of Miss Kingsley's journey 
from Kangwe to Agonjo, in large part over 
territory never before crossed by a white man, 
much less by a white woman. This journey, 
made through forest, swamp, and river, afoot, 
and also alone, save only for a few natives, and 
these mostly cannibals, certainly marks Miss 
Kingsley as the most plucky of womankind. 
Even in the haunts of gorillas and cannibals, 
she is quite undismayed. One night, in a can- 
nibal's hut, she awoke and noticed a suspicious 
smell. 

" Knocking the ash-end off the smouldering bush-light 
that lay burning on the floor, I investigated, and tracked 
it to those bags, so I took down the biggest one, and 
carefully noted how the tie had been put around its 
mouth; for these things are important and often mean 
a lot. I then shook its contents out in my hat, for fear 
of losing anything of value. They were a human hand, 
three big toes, four eyes, two ears, and other portions 
of the human frame. The hand was fresh, the others 
only so so, and shrivelled. Replacing them, I tied the 
bag up, and hung it up again. I subsequently learnt 
that although the Fans will eat their fellow friendly 
tribesfolk, yet they like to keep a little something be- 
longing to them as a memento. This touching trait in 
their character I learnt from Wiki; and, though it 's to 
their credit, under the circumstances, still it 's an un- 
pleasant practice when they hang the remains in the 
bedroom you occupy, particularly if the bereavement in 
your host's family has been recent." 

Miss Kingsley is rather condemnatory of 
missionaries, though she looks upon the Mission 
Evangelique with much favor. West African 
traders she regards as an unjustly abused class. 
She speaks very highly of the administration 
of Congo Franais, and regards M. de Brazza 
as " the greatest of all West African explorers." 
She also has a good word to say for the much 
impugned veracity of Du Chaillu. 

Though Miss Kingsley, as befits a niece of 
Charles Kingsley, shares in his interest in nat- 
ural phenomena, she is far from possessing his 
aptitude for literary style. She fairly blurts 
out her remarks in the most abrupt and des- 
perate fashion ; and the book is further marred 
by coarse flippancy and jocular smartness of a 
low masculine type. However, she is always

terse and vigorous, and by pure good luck some- 
times attains for a few sentences to a really good 
descriptive style. 

On the whole, notwithstanding that some of 
the earlier and later chapters are " padding," 
this work impresses us as a strong, original, 
veracious, and important book, and we trust 
that Miss Kingsley will publish further results 
of her studies of the West African man and his 
country. The illustrations are good, and the 
appendices are valuable ; but we regret the ab- 
sence of a map. HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



THE ORBIT OF FAITH.* 



If we put " The Ambassador of Christ," by Car- 
dinal Gibbons, at the perigee in the revolution of 
religious belief as nearest in its own feeling to the 
Eternal Centre, and " Guesses at the Riddle of 
Existence," by Goldwin Smith, at the apogee as 
farthest off, we see how vast and how eccentric the 
orbit of faith has become. Here, the light and heat 
so stream in as to bathe the spirit and become the 
one productive power of the world ; there they 
dwindle and fade till they are no more than the 
insensible beams of a remote star, caught sight of 
at rare intervals in the shifty night. We are trav- 
ersing immense spaces, seeking anew the construc- 
tive forces of creation. 

The work of Cardinal Gibbons cannot fail to 
impress the earnest spirit with its simplicity, direct- 
ness, and devotion. We can easily believe that the 
hope of the author will be fulfilled, and that it will 
animate the clergy with renewed ardor in the culti- 
vation of piety and science. There is a very appre- 
ciative recognition in the preface of the genius of 
American institutions, and of the American people. 
This is the more observable, because we have just 
been suffering from one of those blind flurries of 
popular hatred to Popery which have so long been 
indigenous in the English race. The volume is rich 
in the current coin of piety which has been in inter- 
change for thousands of years between the wisest 
and the best of men. It is rather an earnest and 
reiterative enforcement of truth, sincerity, charity, 
chastity, diligence, knowledge, than any new and

logical development of them. It is, and was intended 
to be, a book of practical persuasive power. This 
much must be conceded in recognition of its noble 
quality. We are compelled, however, as one well 
outside of its ecclesiastical atmosphere, to feel that 
this most friendly voice of admonition comes from 
a period and a method well behind us. It fails to 
recognize fully either the peculiar strain of our time 
or its peculiar inspiration. It is as if a son who had 
endured strange temptations, and caught unusual 
glimpses of truth, should return to the home of his 
childhood and hear once more from the lips of his 
venerable father the well-worn precepts of his youth. 
He might listen to them reverently and profitably, 
and yet feel that they did not probe his soul to the 
bottom. 

Archbishop Ireland has been for a long time one 
of those who have helped us to associate an earnest 
public spirit with high ecclesiastical position. It is 
a rare combination. The present volume, ' The 
Church and Modern Society," is, as the title implies, 
an expression of this interest. Most of the ad- 
dresses which compose it turn, directly or indirectly, 
on the duties of the Church and State in reference 
to each other. " For the sake of the world, the 
Church must be in close contact with life, and must 
face the living issues of the day." This is the un- 
derlying sentiment of the entire volume. It finds 
full and forceful expression in the address entitled 
" The Church and the Age," delivered in Baltimore 
at an anniversary of the episcopal consecration of 
Cardinal Gibbons. It was spoken to a large repre- 
sentative assembly of Catholic clergy, and is full of 
the fire of profound conviction. The style is clear 
and direct, and charged everywhere with the ruling 
idea. Such simplicity and dignity of purpose and 
such moral force are sure to carry his words to the 
hearts of men. He apologizes for not treating the 
labor movement in this volume. He felt it to be too 
large a subject for the space he could assign it. 
Leo XIII. receives ardent commendation for his 
sympathy with social development. There is an 
outspoken address on "Intemperance and Law," 
and an equally direct paper on " The Church and 
the Saloon." Archbishop Ireland, in two addresses, 
defines the attitude of the Church in reference to 
our public-school system. It is an attitude in no way 
hostile. The Church wholly concurs with the public- 
school system of the United States. It is simply 
not willing to yield the right of religious instruction. 
The Archbishop claims, what has long seemed to 
us undeniable justice, that the public should dis- 
criminate between secular and religious education ; 
should support the one and tolerate the other. This 
is a moral elevation to which the American people 
have not yet attained. The addresses are replete 
with patriotism ; and if the reader wishes to meet 
a strong mind fired with large and generous pur- 
poses, he will find it in this volume. 

" Contemporary Theology and Theism," by Prof. 
R. M. Wenley, is a work of unusual power. It 
handles the deepest religious themes with insight

and large suggestion. The intuitive line of thought 
prevails. Those who remember Professor Morris 
with affection will rejoice that Professor Wenley is 
associated with the University of Michigan. The 
book is made up of three parts. The first part con- 
siders historically and critically what the author 
terms the " Speculative Theology " of the present, 
the theology that rests back on the powerful render- 
ing of history and theology by Hegel the most 
vigorous remedy that has ever been administered 
to the ill-digestion of pure empiricism. The author 
finds that this movement, while disappearing in its 
formal elements, has left a large remainder of insight. 
The second part is occupied with Ritschlian theol- 
ogy. This has arisen in antagonism both to the 
extreme empirical and extreme speculative tendency. 
Christ is considered in his character and teachings 
simply as an ethical, spiritual force. His words are 
of supreme moment to men because of the hold they 
have on men's thoughts. Here are undoubted inner 
phenomena, not to be surpassed in their actual 
power over human life. Feeling and accepting these 
words of truth, we are made superior to scientific, 
historical, and speculative criticism. We have our 
own facts of their own order. The criticism of the 
author at this point seems to us a little severe. We 
may accept this attitude of liitschl as at least a 
provisional one. The third part of this work takes 
up more independently the " Theistic Problem." It 
undertakes, at the same time, a philosophical and 
a religious construction of the world. It affirms 
that theology brings to the problem of being terms 
that may, indeed, make it more complex, but also 
make it more intelligible. All deep questions are 
answered together, or not well answered. We com- 
mend the volume to lovers of philosophical religious 
thought. 

" Immortality and the New Theodicy," like the 
previous volume, grew out of a lecture. In this case, 
the lecture was given in Harvard University under 
the Ingersoll bequest. In the former case, the ad- 
dress was given to the Glasgow University Theolog- 
ical Society. The effort is " to carry the question 
of the immortality of man to the moral conception 
of the universe for determination." The ardent 
spiritual temperament of Dr. Gordon fits him to 
affirm the force and integrity of the moral idea. 
" When it is the sword of the spirit by which a man 
seeks to live, he should ask no happier fate than to 
die by it." There is a noble enthusiasm pervading 
the words of Dr. Gordon. To us, at least, they seem 
to arise from a true insight into the spiritual rela- 
tions of the world. The doctrine of immortality is 
so dependent on our sense of the inner character of 
the world that we cannot handle it, any more than 
we can handle a point of aesthetical criticism, aside 
from the feelings involved in it. " The three grand 
positions from which faith in a hereafter for man 
would seem to follow are the moral perfection of 
the Creator, the reasonableness of the universe, and 
the worth of human life. The three are at heart 
one ; for if the first is true, if God is absolutely good, 



the other two must follow" (page 46). "A uni- 
verse that defeats his best life, that contradicts his 
deepest thought, cannot be considered by man at 
least as the expression of Supreme Reason " (page 
57). " The appeal in behalf of the permanence of 
man is ultimately away from all matters of physical 
organization, to the heart of the universe, to the 
Absolute conscience and pity that are believed to 
have dominion over all things " (page 59). Immor- 
tality resolves itself into faith, and faith resolves 
itself into the force of our spiritual powers. The 
volume is full of inspiration to the concurrent mind. 
Mr. Goldwin Smith's " Guesses at the Riddle of 
Existence" is made up of five essays. The first 
essay gives the title to the book. The remaining 
four are : " The Church and the Old Testament," 
"Is There Another Life?" "The Miraculous Ele- 
ment in Christianity," " Morality and Theism." 
The astute, incisive character of the author's literary 
work is too well known to call for any comment. 
The first essay is a criticism on Professor Drum- 
mond, Mr. Kidd, and Mr. Balfour. Much of it is 
telling and true. While, however, we do not com- 
plain of the temper of the book as especially faulty, 
we cannot think it of the best. Destructive criti- 
cism is not often either wholly kindly or just. One 
cannot trim a tree without knowing equally well 
what is to be retained and what is to be cut away. 
The bull that worries and tears an evergreen shrub 
with its horns is not trimming it. Mr. Smith ful- 
fils his purpose in breaking down and pulling to 
pieces. He feels no disposition to save and restore. 
This is not making one's work a part of the con- 
structive labor of humanity. Why should one paint 
again the picture of life, as in the article on immor- 
ality, in all its darkest colors, simply because he has 
a trick of hand in these dismal, distressing shades ? 
The plea of truth hardly avails. It is not true to 
analyze out and heap up the evil of the world, and 
offer it as the world. It is not the world ; it is only 
its distressful, distorted shadow. It is both stale 
criticism and shallow criticism to decry the phi- 
losophy of the world. Most of the subsoiling of the 
human mind has been done, and is still done, in 
this very region of philosophy metaphysics, if you 
will. Mr. Smith assumes as accepted truth what is 
not accepted, and is at best only a metaphysical ren- 
dering of facts. " We know . . . that what he calls 
the soul is but the higher and finer activity of our 
general frame." If Mr. Smith knows that, he might 
certainly have saved himself the labor of casting up 
again the doubts of immortality. Mr. Smith treats 
unfairly the enthusiasm of Professor Drummond. 
The love of the mother for her child is altruistic, 
though not a very pure example of altruism. There 
is in it natural affection, but there is also the germ 
of spiritual affection. Altruism is not, as Mr. 
Smith seems to imply, doing good to others with no 
reference to ourselves ; it is finding our highest 
pleasure in doing good to others. It is enclosing 
others in the tissue of our spiritual lives. There is, 
in the way that many have of casting, in the name

of science, dark shadows on the world, great exag- 
geration. These persons stand between the light 
and the world, and then draw attention to the gloom 
they have occasioned. A highly organized being, 
full of intense and morbid feelings, physical and 
intellectual, reads his own degrees and moods of 
suffering into the world, and then pronounces upon 
it. The world is to be rendered from its own centre 
as a happy-go-lucky product, and so rendered is far 
more enjoyable than the sharp critic of good, and 
the diligent delineator of evil, make it out to be. 

" The Knowledge of Life," by Mr. H. J. Harald, 
stands for the speculations of a single person. Ob- 
jectionable as the dogmatism of the believer may be, 
it is not as objectionable as the dogmatism of the 
unbeliever. The first is consistent with its own 
principles, and is supported by more or less concur- 
rent belief. The second is scornful of belief, and 
yet has nothing but the belief of one person to offer 
in its place. It is as if a man should deny the exist- 
ence of any road, and yet claim that his own half- 
effaced tracks across a waste of drifting snows was 
the king's highway. " Great religions have taken 
their rise in this mystery the mystery of life 
professing to expound it ; but despite all, we are 
little if any nearer the solution to-day." Now, 
under these trying circumstances, our author buckles 
on his armor better, slips on his snow-shoes, and 
takes the lead. Religion is the aim of life ; the 
aim of life is evolution. Immortality is the con- 
tinuity of evolution. The amoeba has his religion, 
though of a somewhat attenuated order. " Religion 
may be called the hand-rail to the path of life," 
to life as a sensuous experience. " The God of 
every man is the spirit within him." To this, his 
prayers are addressed. As the expression of a shal- 
low, empirical self-confidence, this volume is rarely 
surpassed. It is impossible to elaborate anything 
which we are content to call religion out of simple 
quasi-mechanical evolution. Mr. Herbert Spencer 
has given us such a prodigious volume of philosophy, 
in which facts looked on as necessary are made the 
causes of themselves, that he puts everyone who 
follows him in the same field to disadvantage. Yet, 
if anyone has a curiosity to see sunbeams extracted 
from cucumbers, this is the book which will interest 
him. The style is perspicuous, and the volume ad- 
mirable in form. A slight redemptive touch is found 
in the discussion of the true position of woman. 

"The Shadow Christ" is a prose poem of much 
delicacy of feeling and scope of thought. It should 
be read, as it was written, with snatches of insight. 
Its motive seems to be that religion must be inter- 
preted from within ; that, like every phase of life, 
it must be grasped as a mastery of its own condi- 
tion. We cannot render the faith of the world reflec- 
tively, across long periods, with no sense of the 
instant, urgent problem involved in it. Religion 
is ever an incarnation, " An empty Bible, in an 
empty universe, in an empty life, to him who dares 
to read a Bible by itself." It is refreshing, after 
the somewhat weary, speculative road we have just 



traveled, to reach this unhesitating phase of faith, 
to which all skepticism is the melancholy moan of 
a dying year. The spirit of the author is an aeolian 
harp which needs only the winds. What matters it 
that this or that harpist is ailing or is gone, the 
music of the world is still in it. It is to this we

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



The theory 
of Beauty. 



A book on the theory of Beauty may 
be a treatise in psychology with Sully, 
in psycho-physics with Fechner, in 
physiology with Grant Allen, in metaphysics with 
Hegel, in history with Taine, from the title, you 
can never guess what kind of a book it is going to 
be. Of one thing, however, the general reader may 
usually feel assured, namely, that it will not be 
interesting, nor even such as he can comprehend. 
To this latter rule there have been notable excep- 
tions ; and Mr. George Santayana has added a new 
one to the worthy few by his book on " The Sense of 
Beauty" (Scribner). For a technical treatise we 
think the book singularly well adapted to general 
reading. The style is easy, the exposition clear, the 
illustration effective. A technical treatise it is ; but 
we think that many beside psychologists and stu- 
dents of scientific aesthetics will be interested in it. 
It is an example of the best form of popular sci- 
ence : the statement by a student of matters special 
to his particular studies, in terms and in form such 
that anyone who is really interested in the matter 
can readily comprehend it. No book on aesthetics 
can be really light reading ; and this book is not, 
though it comes even dangerously near it. One 
would infer from the title that the standpoint is 
psychological ; and, indeed, the author says as much. 
It is, however, not rigidly psychological, according 
to our idea : it certainly tends rather to the specu- 
lative than to the psycho-physical. To our minds, 
the chief value of Mr. Santayana's book lies in 
his definition of Beauty and in his discussion of 
Form. We do not find any very satisfactory solu- 
tion of the problem of the origin of beauty, although 
the author seems to regard it as necessary to his 
treatment (p. 5). Nor do we find anything with 
which we can rest satisfied as a criterion of degree 
(p. 130). These are two important aesthetic prob- 
lems, and we do not find that Mr. Santayana says 
very much that helps us. On the points noted above, 
however, we think him excellent : his discrimination 
between aesthetics and ethics, between aesthetics 
again and hedonics, the aesthetic differentia, his final 
definition, all these we regard as admirable. The 
idea of the definition itself we have met with before ; 
but the development of idea in reaching it seems to 
us a considerable achievement. We also admire 
Mr. Santayana's dealings with Form. Without feel- 
ing that the last word has been said, we do feel that 
a number of things have been made clearer. We 
like also some of the results, indeed, are influ-

enced, perhaps, in our judgment of the theory by 
the neatness of some of the explanations. This we 
confess is unscientific, and yet we could not help 
a thrill of conclusiveness at Mr. Santayana's expla- 
nation of the preference of our time for suggestion 
over form (p. 96) or of the superadded charm of 
associated expressiveness, which is so common now- 
adays (p. 85), a feeling which was, we fear, more 
realized than our assent to the progress of his argu- 
ment. The book is one which the specialist will 
study carefully, and from which anybody may carry 
away much. 

Doctor Johnson, while listening to 
8ome music that rather bored him, 
was assured that the piece was inor- 
dinately difficult : he wished it had been impossible. 
Such will be the harsh judgment of some concerning 
Tone Noguchi's " Seen and Unseen " (Gelett Bur- 
gess and Porter Garnett) ; but from such inhospi- 
tality we hasten to dissent. True, we do not agree 
with Mr. Gelett Burgess, who thinks that this young 
Japanese " has discovered fresh beauties and unex- 
pected charms in our speech." But then, Mr. Gelett 
Burgess is known to be a consummate wag : we 
almost believe that he has written these poems him- 
self, to rival Mrs. Browning and Prosper Me'rime'e. 
We do see fresh beauties and charms certainly un- 
expected in these poems, but they are such as we 
perceive in any broken English in the mouth of a 
pretty woman or a clever man. Nor do we think 
that Yone Noguchi has " honoured our tongue by 
his writings ": in this view of his, Mr. Gelett Bur- 
gess shows himself inappreciative of those things 
which really are the honor and glory of the English 
language. Nothing is gained by taking the matter 
too seriously ; it is needless to affirm that Noguchi 
is the greatest poet since Maeterlinck. Let us be 
content with the actual facts ; he has written some 
reveries full of delicate wanderings of sentiment, of 
charming vagaries of the imagination. As such we 
think his poems will surely give pleasure to many; 
we think that not a few will turn in sympathetic 
affection to " The Homeless Snail " whose attract- 
ive face appears on his frontispiece. We have here 
the simple and naive utterances of one whose mind 
works in a manner quite strange to our ordinary 
modes of thought ; and that is something that many 
will appreciate. We have also many quaint and 
delicate flowers of a fancy quite different from our 
fancy ; that also has its charm. To find really 
great thought or really beautiful expression would, 
to say the least, require determination or profound 
study. We ourselves think the work particularly 
interesting, because, without having in any way the 
spirit of Walt Whitman, it has to a great extent 
possessed itself of his form : not simply the rhyme- 
less, unrhythmical line, but the less obvious points, 
the exclamation and apostrophe, the anaphora 
and repetition, the absolute constructions and the 
parentheses, the neologisms, and so on. And this 
is interesting because it shows, to some extent, the

capabilities of that form as a form. But we did not 
mean to make a new poet the subject of a technical 
disquisition ; that shows a pedantic and doctrinaire 
spirit that should be far from one who is fortunate 
enough to have to do with a new poet. We find 
the quality of Yone Noguchi pleasing, and we wish 
he did not feel so terribly lonely. 

The forty-sixth volume of the " Story 
of the Nations" series (Putnam), 

with its beautiful illustrations, is the 

most interesting of all to the American reader, 
since it tells a tale of our own times and of our 
most closely connected neighbor. The story-teller 
is Mr. J. G. Bourinot, Clerk of the Canadian House 
of Commons, and pleasantly known by his partici- 
pation in our societies of learning and his coopera- 
tion in the different plans of research and bibli- 
ography in the two countries from time to time. 
The task of condensing four centuries " from the 
day the Breton sailor ascended the St. Lawrence 
to Hochelaga, until the formation of the Confeder- 
ation which united the people of two distinct nation- 
alities " into less than four hundred pages must 
appear peculiarly formidable to so intensive a stu- 
dent and so minute an investigator. Yet the work 
has been most skilfully done, and the last hundred 
pages have thus been reserved for modern Canada 
the part of the book to which the American 
reader will turn first, to ascertain the views of so 
authoritative a writer upon the future of Canada 
and her relations to the United States. Of the Cana- 
dian future, Mr. Bourinot is justly sanguine. "All 
classes now agree as to preserving the federal sys- 
tem in its entirety, since it ensures better than any 
other system of government the rights and interests 
of the French Canadian population. . . . No French 
Canadian writer or politician of weight now urges 
so impossible or suicidal a scheme as the foundation 
of an independent French nationality on the banks 
of the St. Lawrence." In common with later Cana- 
dian writers, Mr. Bourinot laments the indifference 
to colonial interests which England displayed in 
adjusting her southern boundary line. By " the 
persistency of American statesmen," u the State of 
Maine now presses like a huge wedge into the prov- 
inces of New Brunswick and Quebec, and a Canadian 
railway is obliged to pass over American territory, 
which many Canadians still believe ought to be apart 
of the Canadian Dominion." Likewise the author 
does not fail to contrast " how honourably her [Can- 
ada's] government discharged its duties of a neutral 
between the belligerents " in our Civil War, and how 
at the time of the Fenian raids the United States 
authorities calmly looked on while all the prepa- 
rations for these raids were in progress ; how the 
President discontinued the prosecutions on request 
of the House of Representatives ; and " for all the 
losses Canada sustained through these invasions of 
her territory, she has never received any compensa- 
tion whatever." Truly, these last hundred pages 
make interesting reading for those American states-

THE DIAL, 



[March 16, 



An old-time 
author of 
Baltimore, 



men who are wont to picture the Dominion sitting 
out in the cold and piteously begging to be allowed 
a humble seat by the Yankee fireside. 

The name of Severn Teackle Wallis 
is an unfamiliar one to readers of our 
day, though known to the last gen- 
eration as that of an eminent lawyer, an able public 
speaker, and a graceful writer of both verse and 
prose. Mr. Wallis was educated at Baltimore, and 
there entered on the practice of his profession, and 
soon was highly esteemed for his ability, integrity, 
public spirit, and scholarly attainments. The most 
noticeable incident in his life was his arrest among 
the " Maryland suspects " in 1861, and his imprison- 
ment for more than a year as a Southern sympa- 
thizer. He died in Baltimore in 1894, at an ad- 
vanced age. Soon after his death, some of his friends 
formed the Wallis Memorial Association; and 
through the efforts of this association a handsome 
library edition of Mr. Wallis's selected works, in 
four well printed volumes, has appeared with the 
imprint of Messrs. John Murphy & Co., Baltimore. 
The first volume includes several addresses which 
well exhibit Mr. Wallis's oratorical powers; per- 
haps the most impressive of these is the discourse 
on the life and character of George Peabody. This 
volume includes also the author's poems, which 
show taste and scholarship ; one of them is the stir- 
ring lyric of " The Guerrillas " (beginning "Awake 
and to horse, my brothers "), which is not unknown 
to collectors of the poetry of the Civil War. The 
second volume consists of miscellaneous reviews 
and political documents, and the third is a reprint 
of " Glimpses of Spain," which was first published 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers in 1849. Mr. Wallis 
had early become a proficient in Spanish literature 
and history, and in 1847, being in ill health, he 
made a journey through Spain, and later published 
this modest volume. It contains much just and 
careful description which would answer almost as 
well for the Spain of to-day as that of a half-century 
ago, written in a mild and genial vein, somewhat in 
the manner of Washington Irving. The fourth vol- 
ume is the result of a second visit to Spain, in 1849, 
made at the instance of the Secretary of the Interior, 
with the object of studying certain Spanish grants 
which had reference to Florida lands. This was 
originally published under the title, " Spain, Her 
Institutions, Politics, and Public Men," and is a 
reliable summary of the Spain of that time. While 
these volumes chiefly appeal to the people of Balti- 
more and Maryland, yet they have a general inter- 
est and value which entitles them at least to a place 
in our larger libraries. 

After a considerable delay, although 
not unreasonable one when we 
consider the magnitude of the under- 
taking, the publishers of Professor Palgrave's " Dic- 
tionary of Political Economy" (Macmillan) have 
put forth the second volume of that valuable work. 



It will be remembered that the first volume was 
published in parts, but this feature of the plan was 
abandoned upon the completion of that volume, and 
we now get all at once the 848 pages that take us 
from F to M inclusive. A third volume will com- 
plete the work. It is difficult to do justice in a few 
words to this much-needed and admirably-planned 
" Dictionary." The bulk of the matter is enormous, 
and the art of condensation has been so skilfully 
exercised as to produce a work of reference in the 
best sense. Both the historical and the theoretical 
aspects of economic science are fully presented, and 
we note with peculiar satisfaction the justice done 
by the editor to the various Continental schools, 
past and present, of economic thought. A rather 
minute subdivision of subject-matter, resulting in 
many short articles rather than in a few elaborate 
essays, has been an essential feature of the editor's 
plan, and the work is thus differentiated from the 
" Cyclopedia " of Mr. Lalor, in which it often takes 
much time and patience to run down a desired fact. 
There are, of course, some elaborate articles, such 
as Finances (20 pages), and Insurance (14 pages), 
but the average is about half a page. The articles 
are written by a great number of scholars, European 
and American, and are all signed. This makes 
inevitable a certain unevenness, which, however, the 
skill of the editor has done much to smooth away. 
Still, as he says of the articles : " Some are the 
labours of practised scholars with a perfect command 
of the vocabulary they employ, enforcing the broad 
views which wider experience enables them to ex- 
press," while " others have been the jottings down 
of hard-working but comparatively uneducated men, 
full of practical common sense and of shrewd ob- 
servation, but sometimes exhibiting a deficiency in 
dialectic skill which prevents them from setting 
forth the truths they desire to inculcate to fullest 
advantage." All students of economics will join in 
congratulating Professor Palgrave upon his two- 
thirds completed work, and be impatient for the 
time when they may place the final volume with the 
two others upon their shelves. 

The Elizabethan Age is as fertile a 

fi <^ for the hi8torian as for the 8tu - 
dent of literature. Major Hume, in 

" The Year after the Armada, and Other Historical 
Studies " (Macmillan), has brought together a num- 
ber of essays dwelling upon this time of knight and 
naval hero. Most of these essays deal with the history 
of the Armada. But in reading them, if one would 
get the continuity of the story he should read them 
in reverse order. As arranged, the reader embarks 
at once with the " Counter Armada of 1589 " an 
English attempt to capture Lisbon. The conflicting 
policies and the intricate problems of European 
politics revolving mainly around England, France, 
and Spain, with accessory complications caused by 
the Reformation in France, Scotland, and the Neth- 
erlands ; the gradual widening of the breach with 
Spain ; the rising religious and national sense of the

English ; the work of the privateers ; the open rup- 
ture with Spain in 1584, and the grand sea struggle 
of 1588, are told in the articles upon " The Coming 
of Philip the Prudent " and " The Evolution of the 
Armada." Perhaps nothing in the whole course of 
the book will arrest the reader's attention more than 
the author's estimate of Philip II., not " a murderous 
ogre, guiltily and silently plotting the enslavement 
of England for thirty years before the great catas- 
trophe which reduced his vast Empire to the rank 
of a harmless second-rate power," but " a laborious, 
narrow-minded, morbidly conscientious man, pa- 
tient, distrustful, and timid ; a sincere lover of 
peace and hater of all sorts of innovations." Mr. 
Hume's ability in character-sketching is remarkable. 
The descriptions of Charles II. and of Philip IV., 
those queer sprigs of the House of Hapsburg, are 
further examples. And when Mr. Hume quits the 
sea, and takes to land with " Julian Romero, Swash- 
buckler," or with " Richard Bere," sometime En- 
glish gentleman and adventurer in petty scrapes, he 
is no less entertaining. Indeed, for a healthy and 
wholesome book, tingling with the old-English spirit, 
smelling of the salt-sea air, and as entertaining as 
Smollett, we commend the pages of " The Year 
after the Armada." 

The True Life of Captain Sir Rich- 
ard Burton ( Appleton ), by his 
niece, Georgiana M. Stisted, is a 
compact, popularly-written book that affords a very 
satisfactory general view of the unique career of the 
great explorer and Arabist. The dryest pen could 
scarcely make a dull tale of the life of Sir Richard 
Burton ; and Miss Stisted writes crisply, graphically, 
and to the point. Her description of Burton's re- 
markable pilgrimage to Mecca and El-Medinah is 
especially good, and she does fair justice to the 
African and South American journeys, the tour in 
the States, and so on. The opening chapters, detail- 
ing Burton's somewhat erratic and unpromising 
early career, are extremely readable. Miss Stisted 
goes a little out of her way, as we think, to air some 
unpleasant family secrets, and her strictures on 
Lady Burton seem rather illiberal one might almost 
say spiteful. Lady Burton was a Romanist, and 
naturally made some attempts to divert her husband 
from paths which she doubtless believed led to per- 
dition and eternal torments of a very material and 
humanly realizable kind. The poor lady's frantic 
efforts, when Burton was on his death-bed, to effect 
a tardy conversion, and her despairing petition to 
the priest to administer Extreme Unction even when 
the body lay cold and stark, and, to the calmer eye, 
plainly inanimate (there might, she thought, be a 
lingering spark of life to sustain the saving efficacy 
of the sacrament), are ascribed by the author to a 
Jesuitical desire on the part of Lady Burton " of 
glorifying her church." Perhaps had the author 
made a little kindly effort to attain to Lady Burton's 
point of view, her closing chapter would have had a 
more charitable ring. The book contains a striking

portrait of Burton, showing a strong, rugged head, 
surmounting the massive neck of an athlete. There 
is an appended list of his works, and the lack of 
an index is partially supplied by a copious table of 
contents. 

The series of papers embraced in 
the little volume entitled " Adeline, 
Countess Schimmelmann " ( Dodd, 
Mead & Co.) present a fairly complete picture of 
the life of a remarkable and, to our thinking, some- 
what erratic lady whose name, we learn, is " a house- 
hold word " in Germany and Scandinavia. Count- 
ess Schimmelmann's story is indeed a singular one, 
and not lacking in the essentials of melodrama. The 
papers, which, with one exception, are from the pen 
of the Countess herself, contain, in the editor's 
rather question-begging phrase, " the record of her 
offense against conventional custom, in forsaking 
the brilliant circles of fashion for obscure toil among 
neglected fishermen, and in attempting the task, so 
often deemed impracticable, of living in literal obe- 
dience to the precepts of Christ." Stated otherwise, 
Countess Schimmelmann's tale is that of a Danish 
lady of rank whose natural pietism, early manifested 
in good works and a reasonable degree of self- 
abnegation, resulted eventually in a form of relig- 
ious and humanitarian monomania that threatened 
her own impoverishment, produced divers eccentric- 
ities of conduct and opinion, and so scandalized her 
relatives that they confined her in a private asylum 
for the insane, whence she was released through 
parliamentary interference. We do not venture to 
pronounce upon the merits of Countess Schimmel- 
mann's case which has attained the dignity of a 
cause cel&bre in her own country, and of which her 
own side only is stated in the present volume ; but 
it must be apparent to the practical mind that " obe- 
dience to the precepts of Christ " may very conceiv- 
ably be carried to a literal and suicidal degree war- 
ranting the intervention of friends and relatives and 
the issuance of a writ de lunatico. To literally 
pluck out and cast away an offending right eye, for 
instance, is not a commendable deed, nor one com- 
patible with the sanity of the doer. The volume 
contains some fairly interesting passages relating to 
the author's life at the court of Berlin, to her Baltic 
missions, to her experiences with Berlin socialists 
and anarchists, and to what she terms her " persecu- 
tion and prison.' ' There are two portraits of Countess 
Schimmelmann. 

Mr. Frank S. Child's The Colonial 
Parson of New England" (The 
Baker & Taylor Co.) is generally 
similar in matter and treatment to the books of 
Mrs. Alice Morse Earle, who has worked with such 
happy results in this Colonial field. Mr. Child has 
gleaned pretty freely from Mrs. Earle, Colonel Hig- 
ginson, and Mr. Bliss, and claims to have gone to 
some extent to original sources. His book is pleas- 
antly written, and affords some amusing and instruc- 
tive glimpses of Colonial parsons in general (omit-

ting, we note, that choice specimen of the cloth, the 
" Maryland Parson "), as well as parsons specific 
the parson political, the parson agricultural, the par- 
son as a scholar, a preacher, an ancestor, and so 
forth. A chapter on " The Parson's Ordination " 
is calculated to dispel most effectually a not uncom- 
mon delusion that the New England Puritan was 
ascetic in the matter of strong drink. Here, e. g., 
is a bill for an ordination in 1785 : "30 Bowles 
of Punch before the People went to Meeting ; 44 
Bowles of Punch at dinner ; 18 Bottles of Wine ; 
8 Bowles of Brandy ; Cherry Rum " (quantity not 
mentioned). It cost the taxpayers of Woburn 
(1729), to launch the Rev. Edwin Jackson on his 
clerical career, six and one-half barrels of cider, 
twenty-five gallons of wine, two gallons of brandy, 
four gallons of rum ; while the diary of one Thomas 
Smith, describing the ordination of the Rev. Samuel 
Foxcrof t at New Gloucester, concludes : " We had 
a pleasant journey home. ... A jolly ordination. 
We lost sight of decorum." To properly " raise " 
a meeting-house, an incredible amount of strong 
liquor was required almost enough to float the 
edifice when raised. Mr. Child's book is a capital 
one of its kind. 

In these days when a comparatively 
few citizens, ashamed of the past 
treatment of dependent and per- 
verted children, are seeking to improve our laws 
and institutions, Mr. W. D. Morrison's book on 
"Juvenile Offenders" (Appleton) appears to be 
timely and valuable. It is a book which should be 
read by every resident of Chicago and every other 
city whose great and growing " dangerous classes " 
are being trained to crime in sweatshops, stores, 
factories, jail, and bridewell. The only form of 
compulsory education we have in Illinois is given 
where the associations are such as to minify the best 
influences of superintendents. Few men in the 
world are so well equipped for writing a book on 
this subject as the talented and gracious chaplain of 
Wordsworth Prison, London. The fact that the 
book was written on English soil does not make it 
less valuable for American students, because the 
principles of social treatment are essentially the 
same for all countries, and because the author has 
made himself acquainted with the methods of our 
institutions in the United States. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Miss Eckenstein's " Women Under Monasticism " 
(Macmillan) is a good contribution to culture-history, 
within limits which are not expressed in the title. The 
subject has to deal almost entirely with convent life in 
England in the Middle Ages. The author brings to bear 
upon her work sympathy, training, and industry. There 
is not a little irony in the paragraph upon the political 
influence of an abbess, because of the unconscious reflec- 
tion upon a Madame du Barry or Pompadour: "The 
career open to the inmates of convents, both in England 



and on the continent, was greater than any other ever 
thrown open to women in the course of modern history. 
Abilities might raise the nun to the rank of abbess, a 
position of substantial authority. In a Kentish charter, 
the names of the abbesses as representatives of religion 
follow those of the bishops." 

Volumes 7 and 8 of the uniform subscription edition 
of Mr. Barrie's writings have just been published by the 
Messrs. Scribner, and the set is now complete. The 
closing volume brings " My Lady Nicotine " and " Mar- 
garet Ogilvy " within one pair of covers a rather incon- 
gruous association, it must be admitted. The volumes 
are exceedingly attractive in form, and the set makes a 
worthy companion for the Field and Stevenson sets for 
which we are indebted to the enterprise of the same 
publishers. 

Volumes 3 and 4 of " American Orations," complet- 
ing the set, have just been published by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. This work, it will be remembered, was 
first edited by Alexander Johnston, and, in its present 
revised form, is due to the scholarly labors of Professor 
James A. Woodburn. Volume 3 continues the subject 
of the anti-slavery struggle down to the actual secession 
of the Southern States; Volume 4 deals with reconstruc- 
tion, free trade and protection, finance, and the reform 
of the civil service. 

Mr. Herbert Small's " Handbook of the New Library 
of Congress " (Curtis & Cameron) is an attractive and 
timely pamphlet. In addition to Mr. Small's detailed 
description of the new building, there is an essay on the 
" Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting " of the Library, 
by Mr. Charles Caffin, and a paper on " The Function 
of a National Library," by Mr. A. R. Spofford. The 
pamphlet is well provided with illustrations, and will be 
a welcome guide to the many visitors with whom the 
capital is thronged during this eventful month. 

We need not characterize the comely volume entitled 
" Undercurrents of the Second Empire " (Putnam) fur- 
ther than to say that it is a liberal aftermath of Paris 
gossip reaped from the seemingly exhaustless memory 
of Mr. Albert E. Vandam, author of " An Englishman 
in Paris." So far as we can see, Mr. Vandam's pen 
shows no signs of flagging. No man certainly ever had 
a better memory for trifles; and readers whose appetites 
are not already dulled by his well-seasoned plats should 
find his latest book quite as entertaining as his first one. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. issue a volume of 
essays by George John Romanes, edited by Principal 
Lloyd, of Bristol, England. The essays, ten in number, 
are reprinted from " The Nineteenth Century " and 
similar periodicals. With a few exceptions they discuss 
corollaries to the main propositions of natural selection 
and the survival of the fittest, as applied to the devel- 
opment of instinct and reason in man and animals. They 
illustrate the versatility of thought and the breadth of 
view of this well-known supporter of Darwin. 

Professor Herbert A. Howe's " Elements of Descrip- 
tive Astronomy " (Silver, Burdett & Co.) is a text-book 
for high-school use. It is attractively printed, and illus- 
trated far more handsomely than such text-books are 
wont to be, but its study can hardly have the disciplin- 
ary results to be obtained from such a book as Professor 
Young's, for example. The author seems all the time 
to be afraid of expecting too much mathematics or 
physics from his students; in other words, he aims to 
make astronomy as easy as possible, which is not exactly 
the aim that such a text should have in view.

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



IjITEKARY NOTES. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. have become incorporated, 
although the name of the house will remain the same as 
heretofore. 

" Isaiah," edited by Mr. R. G. Moulton, is the latest 
volume of " The Modern Reader's Bible," published by 
the Maemillan Co. 

The life of Tennyson, by Lord Hallam Tennyson, is 
now in the press, and will be published in October by 
the Maemillan Co. 

The Rev. Henry Van Dyke's first volume of verse, 
" The Builders, and Other Poems," will soon be issued 
by the Messrs. Scribner. 

" Arden of Feversham," edited by the Rev. Ronald 
Bayne, has been added to the " Temple Dramatists," 
published by the Maemillan Co. 

Messrs. Lyon & Healy, Chicago, have just issued a 
prettily printed book of 272 pages about " Old Violins," 
which should interest violinists everywhere. 

Mr. J. G. Bartholomew's " Pocket Atlas of the 
World " is now published in its tenth edition, rewritten 
and much extended, by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Herr Bjornson's " Magnhild " and " Dust " are com- 
bined to form the sixth volume of the new edition of 
the great Norwegian in course of publication by the 
Maemillan Co. 

The Doubleday & McClure Co., a new publishing 
house, will begin active operations in New York next 
autumn. Mr. A. F. Jaccaci has become art editor of 
" McClure's Magazine." 

Part IX. of Professor M. Jastrow's "Dictionary of 
the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and 
the Midrashic Literature" has just been published by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard, the veteran poet and 
literary critic, is to receive the well-deserved tribute of 
a complimentary dinner from the Authors Club, in New 
York, on the evening of March 25. 

Dr. Garnett, lecturing the other evening on " The 
Dictionary of National Biography," held out hopes that 
this great work might be completed in 1899. It will 
fill about 25,000 pages, and deal with about 30,000 
names. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish " A History 
of China," being the historical chapters from S. W. 
Williams's " The Middle Kingdom," supplemented by a 
chapter upon recent events, prepared by Mr. F. W. 
Williams. 

Dr. G. E. Wire, secretary of the fund for a memorial 
bust of the late W. F. Poole, reports that $380 of the 
needed $500 has been subscribed, and solicits further 
contributions. Dr. Wire's address is 1574 Judson Ave., 
Evanston, 111. 

Professor Willard Fiske has placed some five hundred 
additional volumes in the Dante library of Cornell Uni- 
versity. This special collection now embraces over six 
thousand volumes, practically all of which are the gift 
of Professor Fiske. 

The " Novoe Vremya " of St. Petersburg states that 
the conclusion of Pushkin's " Russalka " has been dis- 
covered among the poet's manuscripts, and will soon be 
published. There are about two hundred verses in the 
newly-found fragment. 

Mr. Charles Day Lanier son of the poet Lanier, 
from whom a strong love of Nature has been inherited 



has made a study of forest-life which will appear in 
" Scribner's Magazine " for April, with the prepossess- 
ing title of The Oak-Dwellers." 

A case of literary versatility is that of Dr. Henry 
Van Dyke, the New York preacher, whose published 
works last year ranged from a volume of sermons to one 
on fishing and hunting, and this year will include a vol- 
ume of poems and another of short stories. 

The February publications of the American Economic 
Association are a Handbook of the Association for 1897 
(including a report of the last December meeting), and 
the presidential address of Dr. H. C. Adams, upon the 
subject of " Economics and Jurisprudence." 

Apropos of our recent article on women at German 
universities (THE DIAL, Feb. 1, 1897), we may note that 
Miss Ellen C. Hinsdale (daughter of Dr. B. A. Hins- 
dale of Michigan) has achieved the distinction of a suc- 
cessful examination at Gb'ttingen in Germanic and Anglo- 
Saxon studies and in philosophy. 

Bacon's Essays and the first part of Malory's " Morte 
Darthur " are the latest additions to the series of " Tem- 
ple Classics," published in this country by the Maemillan 
Co. The archaic spelling and punctuation of the orig- 
inal have been retained in the " Essays," but in the 
" Morte Darthur " both are " modernized " so far as 
possible. 

The illustrated " International Magazine," which has 
for its main feature the publication of translations of 
current continental literature, begins in its March num- 
ber as a special feature an " international register " of 
first-class passengers sailing from our Atlantic ports, 
with vessels and dates. The " International " is pub- 
lished at 358 Dearborn Street, Chicago. 

The " Cumulative Index to a Selected List of Peri- 
odicals," issued by the Cleveland Public Library, has 
entered upon its second year with an enlarged list, in- 
cluding seventy-five periodicals in the monthly index. 
Twenty-five others will be included in the annual vol- 
ume published at the end of the year. The current 
issue (January-February) contains a special Cuban list 
of great value. 

Dr. Nansen's "Farthest North" is now definitely 
announced by Messrs. Harper & Brothers for publica- 
tion on the 19th inst. The work is in two large octavo 
volumes, profusely illustrated, and, being published 
simultaneously in several languages, is attracting the 
attention of the whole reading world. It will be re- 
viewed, from advance sheets already received, in the 
next issue of THE DIAL. 

With the March number, Mr. John Lane begins the 
publication in this country of " The International Studio," 
a monthly magazine of fine and applied art, edited by 
Mr. Charles Holme. It turns out to be the familiar 
London " Studio " under a new name, with a few pages 
of American notes at the end. The magazine is pro- 
fusely illustrated, and exceedingly attractive in appear- 
ance, to say nothing of the marked excellence of the 
contents. 

Mr. A. J. Grant's new edition of Rawlinson's Herod- 
otus gives us the text unchanged except for the sub- 
stitution of the Greek names of the gods for the Latin 
forms used by the translator but abridges the notes 
greatly, and leaves out the appendices altogether. The 
resulting work, now imported by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons, is contained within two volumes of moderate 
size, and the price, of course, is much less than that 
asked for the earlier and fuller edition.

WILLIAM PENN'S PLAN FOR 

The United States of Europe. 

In 1693, one hundred years before Kant wrote his " Eternal 
Peace," William Penn published a remarkable "Essay towards 
the Present and Future Peace of Europe," proposing a general 
union of the nations of Europe, with a federal parliament, as 
the only sure means of peace. This great essay, almost for- 
gotten, is now added to Old South Leaflets, being No. 75 in 
the series. The interest in international arbitration and peace 
is so great that this essay should be read everywhere. 

Price, 5 cents a copy, $4 per 100. Three bound volumes of 
the Leaflets are now ready, price $1.50 each. Send for com- 
plete lists.

Westward Through the T{ockies. 

The traveler, tourist, or business man is wise when he selects 
the Rio Grande Western Railway, " Great Salt Lake Route," 
for his route to the Pacific Coast. It is the only transconti- 
nental line passing directly through Salt Lake City, and in 
addition to the glimpse it affords of the Temple City, the 
Great Salt Lake and picturesque Salt Lake and Utah Valley, 
it offers the choice of three distinct routes through the moun- 
tains and the most magnificent scenery in the world. On all 
Pacific Coast tourist tickets stop-overs are granted at Denver, 
Colorado Springs, Manitou, Leadville, Glenwood Springs, Salt 
Lake City, Ogden, and other points of interest. Double daily 
train service and through Pullman and Tourist sleeping-cars

he did when he began . . . thoroughly interesting if merely for its cu-

Boston A dvertiser : " Scientific, yet in the best sense of the word popu-

THE CENTURY CO.'S BOOKS. 



Ready in 



PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE. 

By AMELIA E. BARB. About 250 pages, illustrated, 

12mo, $1.50. 

To the story as it appeared in THE CENTURY MAGAZINE 
last fall the author has prefixed an account of the life, love, 
and early death of the hero's father, Liot Borson. As the sin 
of the father is visited upon the son, this throwing of light 
upon David's antecedents still further strengthens an already 
powerful tale. Mrs. Barr has written nothing stronger, or 
withal more readable, than this little tragedy of a Shetland 
fisher- village. 

"THE STAND-BY." 

By EDMUND P. DOLE. About 250 pages, 12mo, $1.25. 
The hero gains his name at college, where he is the captain 
of a victorious crew ; and retains it as the editor of a vigorous 
prohibition paper in a city despotically ruled by a wealthy 
brewer. The temperance question is fully and fairly treated, 
but the chief interest lies in the conflict of an irresistible force 
with an almost immovable body. The story is founded on fact. 
There are no points in it where the reader's interest flags. 

ONE MAN WHO WAS CONTENT. 

By Mrs. SCHUYLEB VAN RENSSELAEB. About 150 pages, 

Kmio, $1.00. 

The author's occasional appearance as a writer of short 
stories had scarcely prepared her readers for the powerful 
impression recently produced by the publication, in magazine 
form, of the profound psychological study that gives its title 
to this collection. As a writer of fiction Mrs. Van Kensselaer 
promises to become no less well known than she is already as 
a critic of art and architecture, and as a worker in the cause 
of education. 

NATURE IN A CITY YARD. 

By CHARLES M. SKINNER. About 160 pages, 16mo, $1.00. 
This is the work of a philosopher a Thoreau transported 
forcibly from Walden Pond, and cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd 
in^a thickly populated city. One would never suspect that 
this ardent d elver in the made soil of a Brooklyn back yard 
was by profession a daily journalist. There is no suspicion of 
hack-work about these "rambling dissertations" on nature, 
art, and society. 

FOR THE COUNTRY." 

By RICHABD WATSON GILDER. About 100 pages, 

16mo, $1.00. 

A collection of the author's poems on patriotic subjects 
Washington at Trenton, The Life- Mask of Abraham Lincoln, 
Grant, Sheridan, Sherman, The Great Remembrance, A Hero 
of Peace, The Heroic Age, etc. The collection has a special 
interest as voicing the soldier sentiment in the period since the 
war ; it upholds the idea of nationality, and of good citizenship 
in times of peace. 

Two books by the Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst, D.D. 
Each about 125 pages, 16mo, $1.00. 

TALKS TO YOUNG MEN. 

The pastor of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church was 
noted as a man of sound sense and a singular facility in the 
production of epigrams, even before he blew the trumpet- blast 
that shook down the walls of Tammany Hall. In these brief 
" Talks " he is as sound and as sententious as of old. 

TALKS TO YOUNG WOMEN. 

Though a man among men, the famous New York preacher 
can address himself as effectively to an audience of women as 
to a mass-meeting of citizens or a congregation of both sexes. 
The secret of this power is that he addresses himself in every 
case straight to the heart and conscience. 



Recent Successes. 



SONNY. 

A Book of Stories. By RUTH MoENERY STUART. $1.00. 
"Sonny" is a little Arkansas boy, whose adventures are 
told by his doting father, a simple old farmer whose whole 
life is wrapped up in the boy. The New York World says, 
" Exquisitely tender, and with a delicate and delicious humor 
that never flags, is this charming little series of monologues." 

WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 

A Book of Essays. By I. ZANOWILL. 8vo, $1.50. 
For the last four or five years Mr. Zangwill has contributed 
to the Pall Mall Gazette a department entitled " Without 
Prejudice," in which he has commented on men, women, life, 
manners, and literature. Such of these comments as have a 
lasting value are gathered into this volume. 

STORIES OF A SANCTIFIED TOWN. 

By LUCY S. FURMAN. 12mo, $1.25. 

James Whitcomb Riley wrote recently to the publishers : 
" Long ago I should have congratulated The Century Co. as I 
did the author of your superb volume, ' Stories of a Sanctified 
Town.' In this immediate region the book is a success and a 
most wholesome and delightful one." The book contains 
twelve stories of a community in Western Kentucky. 

THE SHADOW CHRIST. 

By GERALD STANLEY LEE. 12mo, $1.25. 
" The aim of the writer of this beautiful little book," says 
a reviewer of the Chicago Living Church, " is to point out how 
intimately connected with our Lord and introductory to him 
are the lives and writings of the Jewish prophets. . . . One 
can hardly read it without feeling its charm and having one's 
thoughts elevated above the literal and earthly." 

ELECTRICITY FOR EVERYBODY. 

By PHILIP ATKINSON. 265 pages, $1.50. 
A new edition of this very popular book has just been issued, 
containing a new chapter on the X-rays, and a number of 
other additions and corrections which bring the work up to 
January 1, 1897. Its object is to meet the demand on the part 
of the general public for information, simply told, in regard 
to the nature and uses of electricity. 

THE CAT AND THE CHERUB. 

Stories by CHESTER BAILEY FERNALD. 300 pages, $1.25. 

This book is attracting very wide attention. The San Fran- 
cisco Call says that " Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard is said to 
have declared ' The Cat and the Cherub ' ' the best short piece 
of fiction produced in the United States within a decade.' " 

THE WONDERFUL WHEEL. 

By MARY TRACY EABLE. 152 pages, $1.25. 
A charming romance of Louisiana, the story of a potter and 
his luminous wheel and its effect upon the ignorant Creoles. 
The Woman's Journal says : " This is a work of genius." 

QUOTATIONS FOR OCCASIONS. 

By KATHABINE B. WOOD. 200 pages, $1.50. 

A collection of 2500 clever quotations for use on menus, 
programmes, etc. It may fairly be included under a list of 
" Books that People are Reading," for it is so entertaining 
that one enjoys the reading of it even without a dinner menu 
to prepare. 

AMERICAN HIGHWAYS. 
By Professor N. S. SHALEB. Illustrated with pictures and 

diagrams, 300 pages, $1.50. 

A book for the practical roadmaker, telling of American 
roads, their conditions and the means by which they may be 
bettered. " The work, although written by a scientist, is not 
the least technical, but is thoroughly popular in its mode of 
treatment of the topic in hand." Boston Post.

dramatic moments. Daily News (London). 

Certainly it will remain for many years to come as an Arc- 
tic classic, and the narrative which beats its record will be

SCIENTIFIC "BOOKS. 

JUST READY. 

AN INTRODUCTION TO GEOLOGY 

By WILLIAM B. SCOTT, 
Blair Professor of Geology and Palaeontology in Princeton 

University, N. J. Cloth, large 12mo, $1.90 net. 
A work dealing principally with American Geology, intended 
to serve as an introduction to that science, both for students 
who desire to pursue the subject exhaustively, and also for the 
much larger class of those who wish merely to obtain an out- 
line of the method and principal results of study of this science. 
The future specialist will benefit by this 
elementary outline showing the relative 
significance of parts of the subject and 
their bearing to the whole and each other. 



LABORATORY PRACTICE 

FOR BEGINNERS IN 

BOTANY. 

By WILLIAM A. SETCHELL, Professor of 
Botany in the University of California, 
formerly Instructor at Yale Univer- 
sity. Cloth, 16mo, 90 cents net. 
The author claims that Botany should 

be taught : 

1. As a science, to cultivate careful, 
accurate observation, together with the 
faculty of drawing from observations the 
proper inferences ; and 

2. As a means of leading the mind of 
the student to interest itself in the phe- 
nomena of nature for its own further de- 
velopment and profit. 

Both aims are carefully kept in view 
during the whole of this little manual.

ROCKS, ROCK -WEATHER- 
ING, AND SOILS. 

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, Curator of the 
Department of Geology, United States 
National Museum, and Professor of 
Geology in the Corcoran Scientific 
School and Graduate School of the 
Columbian University. Fully Illus- 
trated. 8vo, $4.00 net. 
Dr. Merrill has taken up a hitherto 
much neglected line of work, and one 
which, on both economic and scientific 
grounds, is of the greatest interest and 
importance. He treats of the origin, 
composition, and structure of the rocks 
composing the earth's crust, the manner 
of their weathering or breaking down, 
and the causes that lead thereto, and 
finally, of the petrographic nature of the 
product of this breaking down. 

The matter is so arranged that the 
book will be of value as a work of refe- 
rence, and also as a text-book for stu- 
dents in the Agricultural Colleges and 
Experimental Stations.

THE PROPOSED TAX ON 
CIVILIZATION. 

Upon the specious pretext of " clearing up the free 
list," the Committee on Ways and Means of the 
House of Representatives, headed by a graduate of 
an honored Eastern college, embodied in the re- 
cently framed tariff bill a provision that for sheer 
brutality and wanton disregard of all the things that 
make for the welfare of a nation was absolutely 
unparalleled in the legislation of countries that make 
the least pretence to civilization, a provision so 
atrocious and so utterly indefensible that we would 
not have believed it possible for the policy that it 
represents to be entertained seriously by any person 
of intelligence. This provision, to state it briefly, 
was that hereafter all books of all kinds, and for all 
uses whatsoever, shall pay a duty of twenty-five per 
centum before being passed through the custom- 
houses of the United States. We have had many 
sorts of tariff laws during the century of our na- 
tional existence, laws good and bad, reasonable 
tariffs and " tariffs of abominations," but such a 
villainy as this was never before even contemplated. 
It has heretofore been taken for granted that uni- 
versities and public libraries were proper objects of 
government encouragement, as far as it was possible 
for legislation to encourage them, and the notion of 
treating them, for purposes of taxation, as we treat 
those things that minister to the tastes of the luxu- 
rious and the vicious, never before, within our knowl- 
edge, found a place in any draft of a proposed leg- 
islative measure. 

It will be remembered that our tariffs have always 
provided for the free entry of all books imported 
for the use of colleges and libraries, and of all books 
over twenty years old even for the use of private 
purchasers. Up to the Act of 1890, however, books 
less than twenty years old, when imported by indi- 
viduals, had been taxed at a rate of twenty-five per 
centum. The Act of 1890, reactionary as it was in 
so many respects, had at least the saving grace of 
adding all books in foreign languages to the free 
list, and thereby lessening the affront to intelligence 
that is implied by any taxation of books whatsoever. 
When the Act of 1894 was framed, it was discov- 
ered, with great regret, that its enlargement of the 
free list had not been liberal enough to wipe away 
the disgraceful tax on new English books, which 
were still kept among dutiable articles, proclaiming 
to the world the hollowness of our national preten- 
sions to enlightenment. For it must not be forgotten 
that the Copyright Act of 1891, with its absolute 
prohibition of the importation of books copyrighted 
in this country, had removed what slight pretext 
there had been for considering a tax on books as a 



206 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



protective measure. In spite of the irrational char- 
acter of this tax, and of the petitions for its aboli- 
tion, circulated by THE DIAL, and signed by great 
numbers of the most representative Americans irre- 
spective of party affiliations, it remained a feature 
of the Act of 1894, a law which made but one slight 
concession to civilization in the shape of a provision 
for the admission, duty free, of books embodying 
the results of original scientific investigation. 

We have now outlined the situation up to the 
other day, when the publication of the proposed new 
tariff law dealt to every friend of education so un- 
expected and so brutal a blow in the face. It took 
some time for the public to discover what had really 
been attempted, since the nefarious plan for taxing 
intelligence was carefully concealed. But the full 
import of the provisions concerning books gradually 
leaked out, and it was also discovered that the ma- 
lign influences which were seeking to discourage ed- 
ucation by the taxation of readers had planned to 
discourage art by restoring the old barbarous tax 
on painting or sculpture, and to discourage science 
by taxing, for the first time in our history, all ap- 
paratus imported for the use of schools and colleges. 
When these facts became generally known, they 
were bound to call forth a protest, and we are 
happy to say that the libraries, and the universities, 
and the more enlightened newspapers of the country 
have been prompt in the expression of their indig- 
nation. During the two or three weeks that fol- 
lowed the discovery, petitions and remonstrances 
came pouring in to Washington in such numbers 
that the framers of the proposed tax were forced to 
recede, in a measure, from their earlier position, 
although the amendment adopted by them is so un- 
satisfactory that nearly as much as ever before still 
remains to be worked for. 

It is upon this amended form of the provision 
relating to books and scientific apparatus that the 
struggle must now be made, and the paragraph is 
so ingeniously worded that a close scrutiny is needed 
to fathom its deceptive intent. It exempts colleges 
and libraries from the payment of duty upon " sci- 
entific apparatus, instruments, books, charts, and 
chemicals, such as are not published or made in the 
United States." This reads well at the first glance, 
but it means almost nothing. Latet anguis in herbd. 
A strict construction of the words " such as are not 
published or made in the United States " would take 
away with one hand nearly all that is given by the 
other. Microscopes, for example, are made in the 
United States ; consequently no college may import 
German microscopes without paying the tax. En- 
glish dictionaries and editions of Shakespeare are 
published in the United States ; consequently no 
public library may import the Cambridge Shake- 
speare or the Oxford Dictionary without tribute to 
the Treasury. As far as it pretends to concede any- 
thing, the paragraph is a mere "blind," while it 
does not even assume to do anything for the student 
and the scholar, who are absolutely dependent upon 
books in the languages of Continental Europe to 



say nothing of English books, new and old and 
who are the last persons in the world that should be 
singled out by any enlightened government for this 
special and peculiarly oppressive form of taxation. 

The reasons advanced in support of this benighted 
measure are too puerile for serious consideration. 
The paragraph relative to free books for libraries, 
we are told, " has proved to be wonderfully elastic," 
which is nothing less than a charge that our libraries 
have been engaged in importing new English books 
for the benefit of private individuals. Since this 
charge is nothing less than one of perjury, it will 
hardly be believed unless it is substantiated by the 
most unimpeachable testimony. The privilege of 
importing " books of scientific research," first 
allowed under the Act of 1894, has been abused, 
we are informed. If so, the fault is surely with the 
Treasury regulations or the laxity of customs offi- 
cials, and by no means calls for the drastic remedy 
proposed. It is further said that new English books 
have been prepared in special editions, with falsely- 
dated title-pages, for the purpose of evading the 
duty. Here, again, no evidence is offered for so 
astonishing a charge ; and here, likewise, the means 
proposed to do away with the abuse are so out of 
proportion with it that they suggest the Chinese 
method of getting roast pig. These arguments are, 
as we have said, merely puerile ; the argument for 
reimposing the tax on books in foreign languages is 
absolutely unique in its absurdity. " We publish an 
abundance " of such books ourselves, says the report 
of the Committee, and airily dismisses the whole 
subject. 

Those who are most firmly wedded to a belief in 
the principle of protection need only clear their 
minds of cant to perceive that the protective prin- 
ciple is not involved in a tax upon books. Our 
copyright legislation provides the only protection 
that is possible under the circumstances, and the 
question of taxing uncopyrighted books is purely a 
question of revenue. The amount of revenue to be 
obtained from such a tax is, of course, insignificant ; 
but were it ten times what it is, the real question 
would remain that of deciding whether books (to 
say nothing of scientific apparatus and works of art) 
are a legitimate subject for the imposition of a 
purely revenue tax. The question is no sooner 
stated than it answers itself. A revenue tax is justi- 
fiable on one of two grounds, and of two only. Either 
it aims to reach the mass of the people ( who would 
else escape national taxation altogether) by falling 
on some article of practically universal consumption, 
or it aims to strike the wealthy through their habits 
of luxurious, or possibly vicious, expenditure. But 
a tax on books accomplishes neither of these objects. 
It strikes instead, for the most part, a comparatively 
small class of consumers, few of whom are wealthy, 
and nearly all of whom deserve every encourage- 
ment that it is possible to give them by such indi- 
rect means as tariff legislation. They are, as a class, 
the men whom the nation should honor beyond all 
others, for their life is one of patriotic service in the 



1897.]

highest sense. They are doing more than any other 
class to make the name of America respected abroad, 
and the country a place in which a civilized man, 
whether native or foreign-horn, may feel at home. 
One word more, and our protest is ended. Aside 
from all considerations of principle, and of civiliza- 
tion, and even of decency, a tax upon books is so 
wanton an affront to intelligent men, that the lower 
grounds of expediency are sufficient upon which to 
condemn it. The class of men who are outraged 
by the proposition is not large, considered numer- 
ically, hut no other class in the Republic is so influ- 
ential in the moulding of opinion. During the com- 
ing months of tariff discussion, we shall doubtless 
hear a great deal about wool and iron, about lumber 
and coal, and comparatively little about books and 
pictures ; but we firmly believe that in the end this 
measure, so seemingly unimportant in the public 
eye, will do more, if persisted in, to injure the polit- 
ical party now in power, than any other feature of 
their proposed reconstruction of the tariff. As a 
mere matter of party tactics, it is a deplorable 
blunder, for the sake of a million or two of addi- 
tional revenue, to irritate and antagonize every edu- 
cated man and every friend of education in the 
entire country. 



THE NEW APHRODITE. 

Out of the deep sea-stream, 

Into the light and the air, 
Rose like a gracious dream 

Venus the fair. 

How much of sorrow and rue, 

How much of joy and peace, 
Sprang that day from the blue 

Waters of Greece ! 

Oh, from a Cyclad's verge, 

Or swift galley's prow, to have seen 
Her, the world's wonder, emerge, 

Veiled in the sheen 

Of her glorious sea-dripping locks, 
Buoyant of limb, and as bright 

As the sole star that leads out the flocks 
Of the shepherdess Night ! 

But what avails it to sigh 

For a glimpse of that day withdrawn ? 
Not for long in the sky 

Stays the fair dawn. 

Ours the nobler lot 

Under the broad noon-tide, 
Gazing, to falter not, 

Till from the wide 

Ocean of life we behold 

Rising in splendor and might, 

Fairer than Venus of old, 
Calmer than Night, 

Purer than Dawn, or the blue 

Depths of ether untrod, 
Nature, the only, the true 

Daughter of God.

RESULTS AND PROSPECTS OF 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 

The pioneers of University Extension in this 
country, as in England, were missionaries and en- 
thusiasts. They dreamed of a system of popular 
education which should promote culture among the 
masses. Lectures on Greek tragedy have not be- 
come popular among working men and women, 
not because of the limitations of the social law of 
culture, nor for lack of zeal among the apostles of 
culture, but because leisure is as necessary for intel- 
lectual progress as previous training. The present 
conditions of industry and knowledge in this country 
make it difficult for the average middle-class citizen 
to appreciate University Extension lectures, to say 
nothing of artisans and domestics. 

The University Extension staff, in the early days 
when every institution was offering lectures, was 
composed of volunteer professors and instructors 
from the several colleges, who offered makeshift 
courses and learned University Extension methods 
while experimenting on the unsuspecting public. 
University Extension had come in response to the 
undoubted lack in the lives of many people of a 
fit use of leisure. The first attempts were expe- 
rimental, but they proved advantageous both to 
the communities and to the universities which were 
to undertake the work more seriously as they grew 
wiser. 

One of the first lessons of experience was the 
necessity of a special University Extension faculty. 
The existing faculties of the various institutions were 
already overworked. So far from having time for 
courses of lectures away from the campus, they had 
not even leisure for personal development. Lack of 
leisure was accompanied by deficient ability. It 
was at first supposed that any able university man 
could deliver Extension lectures ; it was soon found, 
however, that the Extension lecturer of even mod- 
erate attainments was rarer than the really compe- 
tent university professor. Not only were there few 
university men who could lecture, but the best lec- 
turers among them, when they lacked either the 
time or the will to adopt Extension methods, by their 
very ability hindered the work of popular education. 
They not only merely entertained the people, but 
made it more difficult for the University Extension 
man subsequently to accomplish any serious educa- 
tional work. There was often abundant enthusiasm 
among the pioneers, but it did not last unless they 
came fully into harmony with the University Ex- 
tension scheme. Enthusiasm has been a large fac- 
tor in all efforts for popular education, and this is 
peculiarly true of University Extension. These de- 
ficiencies in the average university man, leisure, 
ability, enthusiasm, necessitated a University Ex- 
tension faculty. The members of this faculty need 
not necessarily give their entire time to Extension 
work, but they must, at least for a short period^each 
year, give to it their undivided energies.

Such a faculty could not be established without 
good financial backing. The only educational insti- 
tution in this country which has seriously undertaken 
University Extension and continued the work to the 
present time has had a deficit in this department of 
thousands of dollars each year. It is quite possible 
in the development of University Extension, by suc- 
cessful division of labor, by the coordination of 
College, University, and University Extension work, 
to make such an investment economical when judged 
by the standards of higher education. These finan- 
cial requirements have, however, excluded the aver- 
age institution from the field. 

Another necessity requiring both money and 
machinery was that of organization. The haphazard 
appeals to the various communities by some univer- 
sity professors, designated temporarily for that work, 
were inadequate for the building up of an educational 
system. Yet, if University Extension is to become 
permanent, the various centres must feel themselves 
a part of a great system. 

While University Extension is still far from be- 
ing well organized anywhere in America, much has 
been done in the last five years in Illinois and neigh- 
boring States. A large number of towns have their 
permanent committees which plan in the Spring for 
one or two or more lectures during the following 
season ; they have, in many cases, their well organ- 
ized study clubs which cooperate with the centre. 
Some of the already existing literary and other clubs 
coordinate their work with that of the centre ; and 
much, though not enough, has already been done in 
organizing circuits of three to six towns, for their 
economy and the convenience of the lecturer. 

Conferences are held in different places, attended 
by the University Extension representatives in the 
neighborhood, which tend to bring the centres into 
contact with each other and into closer relations 
with the university. By means of regularly organ- 
ized class and correspondence study, many students 
come into very intimate relations with the univer- 
sity, taking annually examinations which will ulti- 
mately count in the securing of a degree. 

There have not been merely difficulties experi- 
enced because of the limitations of the universities, 
but there were also discovered to be serious defi- 
ciencies on the part of the people. Only a limited 
range of subjects was found to be adapted to the 
average community. It is not possible to establish 
what may properly be called an educational system 
where people demand a continuous cycle of history, 
literature, and sociology. Such restricted demands 
do not encourage the universities, and they impose 
heavy burdens on the local committees that desire 
to promote culture in their constituencies. The 
University Extension lecturer meets no more serious 
obstacle than the bad habits of thought and inade- 
quate methods of observation which are almost uni- 
versal. There is little cure for these evils in the 
very common pedantry and carelessness of the uni- 
versity men, but the University Extension system 



can more easily overcome the latter evil than the 
former. No member of society has been made to 
feel the bane of modern commercialism more em- 
phatically than the Extension lecturer. It makes it 
difficult to get an audience for anything but amuse- 
ment, to secure attention to controversial topics, and, 
above all, to interest men. A not insignificant diffi- 
culty confronting the lecturer has been the long and 
uncomfortable railway journey, ending in bad accom- 
modations at the typical American hotel, where even 
" all the modern improvements " will not compen- 
sate for the bad meals. 

Some advantages, however, have been discovered 
which more than make amends for the difficulties. 
The first is the nucleus of ambitious intellectual 
people in every sizable community ; the second is 
the body of progressive school-teachers so often 
found ; the third is the modern woman's club, which, 
with all its dilletantism, is one of the most hopeful 
of contemporary organizations to the educator ; the 
fourth efficient aid is the public library, often the 
most satisfactory means of culture in the American 
city. 

In the endeavor of the universities to grapple with 
these problems of popular education, what can be 
said to be the results attained or attainable ? There 
has been, at least on the part of one institution, a 
differentiation of method to meet the different 
classes of students and hearers. The University of 
Chicago offers lecture- studies in courses of six or 
twelve, with accompanying syllabi, libraries, and 
classes, designed to reach promiscuous audiences 
which are held together by the organized efforts of 
the local committees and the attractiveness of the 
lectures ; class study-courses of twenty-four hours, 
attracting teachers, clergymen, business men and 
women, and others, constituting a University Minor, 
and duplicating university work; correspondence 
study-courses, giving to individual students in any 
part of the world twenty or forty lessons that enable 
them also to accomplish university work. With the 
better organization of centres and a growing confi- 
dence in the university, it has been possible to extend 
the range of subjects offered to the centres. It is 
found, too, that University Extension is proving a de- 
cided stimulus to the intellectual life of the commu- 
nities that undertake it. The clubs, the schools, the 
churches, even the newspapers, have been aroused 
to greater intellectual activity. A minor but gen- 
uine impetus has been given to the intellectual life 
of the university by the introduction of Extension 
methods into its work, and by the enthusiasm which 
comes from contact with the people. A valuable 
result has been the promotion of good feeling be- 
tween town and gown. The university and the 
public are drawn closer together by University Ex- 
tension than by any other means ; one evidence of 
this being found in the number of students who are 
attracted to the university by their University Exten- 
sion experiences. 

There is no doubt that University Extension can

become a part of our educational system wherever 
a university fairly meets the difficulties suggested in 
this article. Not so much is now expected as was 
hoped five years ago ; but there is a basis for the 
present expectation. The process of selection which 
has gone on, both among the lecturers and the 
Extension centres, together with the lessons of expe- 
rience, have limited the scope of University Exten- 
sion and made moderate ideals attainable.

THE USE OF "LEARN" FOR "TEACH." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In regard to Mr. John Albee's citation of Tennyson's 
use of " learn " for " teach," permit me to suggest that 
Tennyson's admiration for the English of the King 
James version of the Bible, and the Book of Common 
Prayer of the English Church, was well known. He 
frequently expressed the opinion that those two books 
contained the best English extant. The use of " learn" for 
" teach " appears repeatedly in the Psalter; e. g., " Lead 
me forth in Thy truth and learn me " (Ps. XXV., 4). 
"They will not be learned" (Ps. LXXXV., 5). O 
learn me true understanding" (Ps. CXIX., 66). The 
Psalms in the Book of Common Prayer follow the trans- 
lation of the Great Bible of 1539. The German word 
lehren is " to teach." And we call a man who has been 
well taught a " learned man." That the use of " learn " 
for teach is now a vulgarism is due to causes which 
Tennyson may not have recognized as sufficient to change 
the English language of the sixteenth century.

ENLARGE THE CIRCLE OF DEMOCRATIC 

SCIENCES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Apropos of a recent communication in your columns 
concerning Whitman, the question arises why the words 
" democracy " and " democratic " should be so narrowly 
limited in their application. It is obviously unfair. 
Now that we bask in the full radiance of a democratic 
literary criticism, by all means let the circle of dem- 
ocratic sciences be extended to include a democratic 
botany, and zoology, and geology, and astronomy, and 
physics, and geometry. Above all, let us have a demo- 
cratic psychology; for unless all signs fail, as they are 
said to do in a dry season, a democratic psychology could 
show some fearful and wonderful results.

THE PUZZLE OF VERNACULAR FORMS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An amusing, and perhaps profitable, diversion of ex- 
act scholars a sport not unknown, indeed, to your own 
columns consists in proving each other ignorant, per- 
verse, and inconsistent in the use of the most familiar 
vernacular forms: infinitives, for instance, the future 
auxiliary, etc. All the world loves a fighter; yet even 
Homeric strife grows at times monotonous, and those of 



us too ignorant and indolent to joust ought no doubt, as 
occasion serves, to try to throw in a fresh bone of con- 
tention. " Upon this hint I speak." 

A few days ago, a class reading Plato's Protagoras 
stumbled over the colloquial idiom, whereby an eager 
proposal of course really future is thrown into a past 
tense (negatived), as if in protest that the thing is not 
already done : " Why did n't you tell us," i. e., " Pray 
tell us," etc. 

Casting about for an illustrative English idiom, we 
chanced on a usage which leaves open the time and 
nearly everything else: " Why not tell us "; " Why not 
call Prodicus." What mood is call or tell? Our first 
appeal was to the copula, as the only verb in English 
with a distinct form for the infinitive. E. g., " Why not 
be quiet." That gave us little comfort. In fact, the 
more we study this puckery idiom the more we feel like 
calling on our neighbor Ajax the Omniscient. 

Is it an infinitive? Some ellipsis, like " Why [is it] 
not [well to] be quiet," seems to be supported by the 
German Warum nicht ruTiig sein ? etc. 
. Is it a dislocated imperative ? "Be quiet: why 
not ? " There are uses of the Greek verb which seem 
to make this plausible. 

Is it a potential, with omitted subject, like Quare non 
sitio tranquilli f 

Lastly, may it not be a plain indicative? There are 
plenty of encroachments of the " bhu " root there also. 
Not only ich, bin, du, bist, or provincial " be'st a fool," but 
Shakespeare's " Everything that pretty bin," " Ye be no 
friends of mine," etc., came readily to mind. 

Here the scholar's Hamlet-like paralysis of the will 
befell us, and we were utterly unable to choose at all. 
Perhaps a four-sided inter-collegiate debate might be 
arranged about the problem. Perhaps nay, probably 
even the hastiest glimpse into a historical English 
syntax would have enlightened us. But we are moving, 
our Matzner is packed, and, lastly, we leave the query 
unanswered by preference, to wing the dilettante's part- 
ing shaft, viz.: With a vernacular bristling full of such 
thorny puzzles, can we fairly expect or desire school- 
children to analyze and classify every subjunctive in the 
Pro Archia, or every an in the Anabasis ? w. Q > L_

TENNYSON'S FONDNESS FOR ARCHAIC WORDS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent's citation of the use of " learn " 
for " teach " by Tennyson simply illustrates the poet's 
fondness for old forms. He was not an absolute purist. 
At least three of the words in my list of " Dialectal Sur- 
vivals," in THE DIAL for March 1, might have been 
illustrated from him. " Holp " for " helped " he uses 
often; as, for instance, in "The Princess," I., 198: 

"He brought it, and himself, a sight to shake 
The midriff of despair with laughter, holp 
To lace us up." 

Little John ( The Foresters,"!., I.) uses the playful 
word circumbendibus, just as Tony Lumpkin did. 

Tennyson and a friend were driving in Derbyshire, 
when some rooks flew by. The friend asked, " Why do 
you make a crow lead the rookery ? " (Locksley Hall, 
68.) The poet replied, " Ask the driver what he calls 
those birds." 

The use of " learn " for " teach " is certainly an 
archaism. CALVIN S. BROWN.

NANSEN'S STORY OF HIS VOYAGE.* 

Having signalized his name and time by an 
achievement that ranks, when regarded abso- 
lutely and apart from social and political con- 
siderations, with the exploits of Columbus, Da 
Gama, and Magellan, Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the 
latest of the long line of Norse explorers whose 
annals run back to the days of Leif and Eric 
the Red, now recounts his adventures in a book 
that for wealth of detail and animation of style 
is at least unsurpassed in the literature of 
Arctic exploration. Lit and vivified by its won- 
derful array of pictures, the story is one to lend 
wings to the feeblest fancy. Engrossed with 
the Defoe-like pages, the sympathetic reader 
embarks with Dr. Nansen on the " Fram," and 
with him watches the headlands of Norway 
wane and fade in the fog, as the sturdy little 
vessel, braced for her long grapple with the 
ice-giant, works her way seaward ; he drifts 
with him, locked in the grip of the ice-floe, into 
the heart of the Polar Sea ; he journeys with 
him by sledge and kayak over the untrodden 
wastes of ice and snow ; he endures with him, 
housed in a den or lair compared with which 
a Lapland hut were luxury, the dragging 
months of the Arctic winter ; he welcomes with 
him the pale beams of the languid polar Spring 
chill and flowerless, but unlocking nature for 
the final stage, southward and homeward, of 
the long journey ; he shares with him the tri- 
umphs of the return to civilization. National 
enthusiasm in Norway is very intelligibly and 
justifiably at a white heat over Dr. Nansen and 
his hardy companions ; and it may be that a 
Norse Homer will arise to sing the voyage of 
the " Fram " and the deeds of these latter-day 
Vikings who travelled the " swan-road " of their 
ancestors, not like them to slay and ravage, but 
to assist in widening man's intellectual domain. 
The theme is a worthy one intrinsically far 
worthier and larger, we may believe, than the 
adventure that inspired the singer of the wan- 
derings of the home-faring Ithacan. But until 
the advent of such not impossible Norse bard, 
Dr. Nansen is likely to remain the sole saga- 
man of his great enterprise. 

The detailed scientific results of the expedi-

tion Dr. Nansen necessarily reserves for fu- 
ture publication. " The scientific observations 
brought back are," he says, "so varied and 
voluminous that it will be some time before 
they can be dealt with by specialists, and be- 
fore any general estimate of their significance 
can be formed." With this exception the rec- 
ord before us is singularly complete. Broadly 
speaking, it comprises : The record of the pe- 
riod of some twenty months (July, 1893, to 
March, 1895) during which Nansen remained 
on board the " Fram," and prior to his leaving 
her for his sledge journey northward with 
Johansen ; the story of this subsidiary sledge 
expedition of fifteen months, from the " Fram," 
at 84 4 ' north latitude and 102 east longitude, 
northward to 86 13.6' north latitude (the 
northernmost point reached), and thence south- 
ward to the point where Nansen and Johansen 
were met by the English party encamped on 
Cape Flora ; the story of the trip homeward on 
the " Windward," and of the arrival at Nor- 
way. The account of the " Fram's " adventures 
after Nansen left her is well told in the Appen- 
dix, by Captain Otto Sverdrup. The opening 
chapters give full details as to the inception of 
the undertaking, the designing and building of 
the " Fram," the personnel of her crew, and so 
on. In his Introduction the author briefly 
summarizes the history of previous Arctic ex- 
peditions, and outlines his theory as to the ex- 
istence of a current across the Polar Sea. ^ 

What, according to Dr. Nansen, are the chief 
results of the Norwegian Polar Expedition ? In 
the first place, it has been demonstrated that 
the circumpolar sea is a deep basin, which is a 
continuation of the channel extending from the 
Atlantic northward between Spitzbergen and 
Greenland. The extent of this deep sea is not 
now certainly known ; but we can safely say 
that it stretches a long way north of Franz 
Josef Land, and eastward to the New Siberian 
Islands. That it extends still further east than 
this is fairly inferable from the " Jeannette " 
party's observations. Dr. Nansen is led to be- 
lieve that in a northerly direction also this deep 
sea is of considerable extent. Nothing was noted, 
either during the drift of the " Fram " or dur- 
ing the sledge journey, that indicated the prox- 
imity of any considerable expanse of land the 
floe seeming to drift unimpeded, especially in 
a northerly course. Any large body of land 
to the north would certainly have checked the 
movement of the ice in that direction. The 
large quantity of drift-ice carried southward 
with great rapidity down the east coast of 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



211 



Greenland also points to the above conclusion. 
" Such extensive ice-fields must have a still 
larger breadth of sea to come from than that 
through which we drifted." A tolerably clear 
idea may now be formed of the way in which 
the drift-ice is continually shifting from one 
side of the polar basin north of Bering Strait, 
across the basin and out towards the Atlantic. 
Where geographers once located a solid ice- 
mantle, massive and impenetrable, sheathing 
the northern extremity of our globe, we now 
find a shifting expanse of drifting ice. The 
motion of this ice is mainly due to the winds 
the prevailing ones, in the sea north of Si- 
beria, being southeasterly. A slow current in 
the water acts as a cooperating force. It will be 
some time, Dr. Nansen adds, before his investi- 
gations as to these points can be satisfactorily 
calculated and checked. 

The hydrographic observations made furnish 
some curious data. 

" Thus, for instance, it was customary to look upon 
the polar basin as being filled with cold water, the tem- 
perature of which stood somewhere about 1.5 C. 
Consequently our observations showing that under the 
cold surface there was warmer water, sometimes at a 
temperature as high as +1 C., were surprising. Again, 
this water was more briny than the water of the polar 
basin has been assumed to be. This warmer and more 
strongly saline water must originate from the warmer 
current of the Atlantic Ocean (the Gulf Stream), flow- 
ing in a north and northeasterly direction off Novaya 
Zemlya and along the west coast of Spitzbergen, and 
then driving under the colder, but lighter and less briny, 
water of the Polar Sea, and filling up the depths of the 
polar basin." 

Concluding his summary of the results of 
the voyage, in their more general aspects, Dr. 
Nansen observes that, while many problems as 
to the polar area are still unsolved, much has 
been done to lift the veil of mystery that has 
so long shrouded those regions. We have been 
put in a position to form a tolerably just idea of 
them ; " and should we in the near future get a 
bird's-eye view of the regions around the Pole 
as seen from a balloon, all the most material 
features will be familiar to us." Still, he admits, 
a new drift, like that of the " Fram," is most 
desirable ; and should such an expedition be 
undertaken (say, through Bering Strait and 
thence northward, or perhaps slightly to the 
northeast) Dr. Nansen is of opinion that the 
observations made will prove of greater scope 
and importance than his own. 

Broadly and popularly speaking, Dr. Nan- 
sen may be said mainly to have accomplished 
two things : (1) He has proved his grand the- 
orem that the true method of Arctic explora- 



tion is the working with and not against the 
forces of nature ; (2) he has reached the north- 
ernmost point yet touched by man. To the inev- 
itable cavil that " after all Nansen did not reach 
the Pole," the Doctor's indignant friends and 
countrymen have replied in a way satisfying 
enough perhaps to practical, scientific minds. 
But the fact asserted remains. The North 
Pole, the goal of so many gallant adventurers, 
is still to be " discovered." Who is destined 
to be the hero, the winner of deathless renown, 
who shall first succeed in planting his country's 
flag at that cynosural point ? Fridtjof Nansen, 
we trust ; since he has, of all who have grap- 
pled with the northern problem, done most to 
point the way and ease the path thither. Nor 
can we easily conceive that Dr. Nansen is or 
was in reality quite so indifferent to the eclat 
of the exploit to the fame, or notoriety if you 
will, of succeeding where Franklin, McClin- 
tock, Parry, Nares, De Long, Peary, failed 
as he would apparently fain have us believe, 
and as he has himself doubtless succeeded in 
believing. To such men as Nansen fame (the 
incentive of high spirits and the spur to great 
ventures) is never a mere bubble, the vacant 
echo of an empty name ; and it is doubtless 
well for humanity that the pseudo-philosophical 
maxims as to the worthlessness of fame have 
never been taken seriously by those able to 
achieve it. We are inclined to think that the 
hope of reaching the Pole was seldom absent 
from and was usually uppermost in Nansen's 
mind so long as the exploit seemed feasible. 
One finds in his journal such tell-tale jottings 
as this : 

" Our aim, as I have so often tried to make clear, is 
not so much to reach the point in which the earth's axis 
terminates, as to traverse and explore the unknown 
Polar Sea; and yet I should like to get to the Pole, too, 
and hope that it will be possible to do so, if only we can 
reach 84 or 85 by March." 

Eighty-four degrees was, as we learn later, 
reached in March ; and it was from that point 
that Nansen and Johansen, leaving the "Fram," 
started north by sledge. Can we doubt what 
was their real goal ? or can we doubt as to their 
bitter chagrin when they were forced to turn 
back, baffled, at 86 13.6'? To argue that, in 
failing to reach the Pole, Nansen missed what 
was to have been the crown and glory of his 
journey, is not to detract from the merit of his 
actual achievement. To argue that the reach- 
ing of the Pole was a matter of small moment 
to him, and that had he reached it his expedi- 
tion would have gained little lustre save in the 



212

apprehension of the vulgar, seems rather futile. 
The voyage of the " Fram " eclipsed all pre- 
vious Arctic ventures. It remains to outdo the 
voyage of the " Fram." 

Dr. Nansen's narrative is happily lacking in 
the harrowing features that sadden the records 
of so many polar expeditions. Privations were 
endured, of course ; and there was no lack of 
perils and even hair-breadth 'scapes ; but the 
party was never in serious straits from hunger 
and exposure. The dogs were the great suf- 
ferers ; and the tale of these unhappy brutes 
dumbly toiling in the service of man through a 
brief life that to them meant little save ice, 
hunger, and stripes is one to wring the heart. 
Says the author (much to his own credit) : 

" It was undeniable cruelty to the poor animals from 
first to last, and one must often look back on it with 
horror. It makes me shudder even now when I think 
of how we beat them mercilessly with thick ash sticks 
when, hardly able to move, they stopped from sheer 
exhaustion. It made one's heart bleed to see them, but 
we turned our eyes away and hardened ourselves. It 
was necessary; forward we must go, and to this end 
everything else must give place. It is the sad part of 
expeditions of this kind that one systematically kills all 
better feelings, until only hard-hearted egoism remains. 
When I think of all those splendid animals, toiling for 
us without a murmur, as long as they could strain a 
muscle, never getting any thanks or even so much as a 
kind word, daily writhing under the lash until the time 
came when they could do no more and death freed them 
from their pangs when I think of how they were left 
behind, one by one, up there on those desolate ice-fields, 
which had been a witness to their faithfulness and devo- 
tion, I have moments of bitter self-reproach." 

The sledge journey was, for men as well as 
dogs, a dreary business enough. The supreme 
moments of it, those which were " looked for- 
ward to the whole day long," were the evenings, 
when the supper was cooked and portioned out, 
and the two travellers, stiff and numb, crept 
into their sleeping-bags to enjoy it, and thaw 
themselves into a faint returning sense of man's 
capacity for something other than pain. 

" But sometimes we were so weary that our eyes 
closed, and we fell asleep with the food on its way to 
our mouths. Our hands would fall back inanimate with 
the spoons in them, and the food would fly out on the 
bag. . . . But even in our dreams we went on cease- 
lessly, grinding at the sledges and driving the dogs, 
always northward, and I was often awakened by hear- 
ing Johansen shouting in his sleep to Pan,' or ' Barra- 
bas,' or ' Klapperslangen ': < Get on, you devil, you! Go 
on, you brutes! Sass, sass !* Now the whole thing is 
going over ! ' and execrations less fit for reproduction, 
until I went to sleep again." 

Food was never seriously lacking during the 
sledge journey ; and the possibility of being 
driven to the hideous dernier ressort of the

Greely party at no time loomed into view. 
Latterly, seal's flesh became plenty. 

" This meat, in our eyes, is as good as meat can be. 
We had it yesterday for breakfast, in the shape of meat 
and soup served with raw blubber. For dinner I served 
a highly successful steak, not to be surpassed by the 
' Grand ' (Hotel), though a good ' seidel ' of bock-beer 
would have been a welcome addition. For supper I 
made blood-pancakes fried in blubber instead of butter, 
and they were a success, inasmuch as Johansen pro- 
nounced them 'first-class,' to say nothing of my own 
sentiments." 

The earliest report of the Norwegian Polar 
Expedition was written by Nan sen in the spring 
of 1896, when he and Johansen broke up their 
winter camp for the final trip south. The paper, 
which was enclosed in a brass tube and hung 
to the roof of the hut, ran as follows : 

" Tuesday, May 19, 1896. We were frozen in north 
of Kotelnoi at about 78 43' north latitude, September 
22, 1893. Drifted northwestward during the following 
year, as we had expected to do. Johansen and I left 
the < Fram ' March 14, 1895, at about 84 4' north lat- 
itude and 103 east longitude, to push on northward. 
The command of the remainder of the expedition wa& 
given to Sverdrup. Found no land northward. On 
April 6, 1895, we had to turn back at 86 14' north lat- 
itude and 95 east longitude, the ice having become 
impassable. Shaped our course for Cape Fligely; but 
our watches having stopped, we did not know our longi- 
tude with certainty, and arrived on August 6, 1895, at 
four glacier-covered islands to the north of this line of 
islands, at about 81 30' north latitude, and about 7 
E. of this place. Reached this place August 26, 1895, 
and thought it safest to winter here. Lived on bear's 
flesh. Are starting to-day southwestward along the 
land, intending to cross over to Spitzbergen at the near- 
est point. We conjecture that we are on Gillies Land. 

FRIDTJOF NANSEN." 

A month after the date of this report, oc- 
curred the meeting between Nansen and the 
Englishman Jackson, near the latter's station 
at Cape Flora. We shall allow ourselves a 
fragmentary extract from the author's account 
of this dramatic finale of his journey. 

". . . Suddenly I thought I heard a shout from a hu- 
man voice, a strange voice, the first for three years. How 
my heart beat and the blood rushed to my brain as I ran 
up on to a hummock and hallooed with all the strength of 
my lungs! Behind that one human voice in the midst of 
the icy desert this one message from life stood home 
and she who was waiting there ; and I saw nothing else as 
I made my way between bergs and ice-ridges. . . . We 
approached one another quickly. I waved my hat; he 
did the same. I heard him speak to his dog, and I lis- 
tened. It was English, and as I drew nearer I thought 
I recognized Mr. Jackson, whom I remembered once to 
have seen. I raised my hat; we extended a hand to one 
another, with a hearty ' How do you do ? ' . . . On one 
side the civilized European in an English check suit and 
high rubber water-boots, well shaved, well groomed, 
bringing with him a perfume of scented soap, percept- 
ible to the wild man's sharpened senses; on the other 
the wild man clad in dirty rags, black with oil and soot,

with long uncombed hair and shaggy beard, black with 
smoke, with a face in which the natural fair complexion 
could not possibly be discerned through the thick layer 
of fat and soot which a winter's endeavors with warm 
water, moss, rags, and at last a knife, had sought in vain 
to remove. No one suspected who he was or whence he 
came. Jackson : I 'm immensely glad to see you.' 
' Thank you; I also.' ' Have you a ship here ? ' ' No; 
my ship is not here.' ' How many are there of you ? ' 
' I have one companion at the ice-edge.' . . . Suddenly 
he stopped, looked me full in the face, and said, quickly : 
' Are n't you Nansen ? ' Yes, I am.' ' By Jove ! I 
am glad to see you ! ' And he seized my hand and 
shook it again, while his whole face became one smile 
of welcome, and delight at the unexpected meeting 
beamed from his dark eyes." 

We need not enlarge on the importance of 
this pictorially and typographically superb 
work. It is emphatically the book, as its author 
is the man, of the hour ; and book and man 
seem destined to long outlast the span of the 
proverbial " nine days' wonder." E. G. J. 



ILLUSTRATIONS or SHAKESPEARE.* 

A few years ago one of the most eminent 
writers of modern times wrote, upon the basis 
of Shakespeare's " Tempest," a philosophical 
drama entitled " Caliban." Whatever may be 
thought of this drama as a continuation of 
" The Tempest," few readers but must be sen- 
sible of its pervasive charm. It is the product 
of a mind of a range little short of Shake- 
spearian. The hopeless jangle of modern opin- 
ion has never been illustrated at once so vari- 
ously and so concisely. If second to Ibsen 
in dramatic vigor, Kenan as far surpasses him 
in catholicity of thought as in grace of style. 
Kenan is the most insinuating of writers : while 
admiring his grace, you are insensibly over- 
mastered by his power. His special note is a 
certain smiling yet not irreverent skepticism, a 
quality so original that the French have been 
forced to coin a word for it, Vironisme. Indeed, 
to apply the much-abused term " skepticism "

to this catholic sense of the relativity of human 
knowledge is to be guilty of a crudity of judg- 
ment quite at variance with the spirit of a 
thinker whose mind is the most delicate of 
instruments of precision. 

Kenan's " Caliban " is a work which might 
appropriately figure in the list of the publica- 
tions of an American Shakespeare Society. 
The great difficulty would lie in finding a com- 
petent translator. The least of the translator's 
qualifications for such a task would be a sound 
knowledge of both languages. Even a trans- 
lator as skilful and refined as Mr. Henry James 
might fail to preserve the exquisite bouquet of 
Kenan's style. In default of such a translator, 
why did not " The Shakespeare Society of New 
York " simply reprint the drama in the French ? 
To say that the translator selected by the So- 
ciety has not a single qualification for the task, 
is to say too little. The translation is so gro- 
tesquely inaccurate as to become a literary curi- 
osity. The publication would be discreditable 
to any literary club in an Arkansas village. 
This version resembles the original about as 
much as the face which Rip Van Winkle beheld 
upon the sign-board of Jonathan Doolittle's 
hotel resembled the face of Washington. 

Abundant justification of this sweeping con- 
demnation is furnished by every page of this 
travesty, which, in point of accuracy, is far 
below the standard of viva voce construing that 
any respectable teacher would set in the class- 
room. The translator and her introducer are 
not even acquainted with the name of their 
author, which they everywhere misprint *' Ke- 
nan." What the author expresses tersely in 
twenty words, the translator bungles in thirty. 
There is space here for but an example or two 
of the quality of the work. The following 
recalls " English as She is Spoke ": 

" Whom didst thou say is the Grand Citizen ? " 
This question of the polished Prospero, thus 
rendered by the translator, reappears in the 
Introduction mended as follows : 

" Whom didst thou say was the Grand Citizen ? " 
Caliban's reference to " ces diablotins qui me 
faisaient tomber dans des fondrieres " ( the 
imps that made me pitch i' the mire), is ren- 
dered : 

" Those little devils which made me fall into fits in 
the thunder." 

Ariel, who is about to be resolved into the 
elements whence Prospero had summoned him, 
in the course of his exquisite final speech, says : 
" D'autres parties iront se perdre dans la chev- 
elure des algues, qui se mirent sur le sable

lost in the hair of the seaweeds which are mir- 
rored upon the wave-marked sand). This is 
transmuted into the following mystic strain :

tresses of the seaweed which mirror themselves upon

Students of French in search of a book to 
drive away the blues (s'epanouir la rate) will 
find their account in this ninth publication of 
" The Shakespeare Society of New York." 

Mr. John Boyd Thacher's " Charlecote, or 
the Trial of William Shakespeare " is a really 
charming little book. Luxuriously and fault- 
lessly printed upon " Imperial Japan paper," 
with illustrations always decorative and in one 
or two instances something more, it is delight- 
ful to hand and eye. Moreover, it pleasantly 
recalls agreeable associations, being a free dra- 
matization of Landor's " Citation of William 
Shakespeare." In some respects Mr. Thacher 
follows closely in the footsteps of Landor, not 
hesitating to reproduce his points and some- 
times his very language. In return he adds a 
good deal of legal jocosity from his own stores. 
Improving a hint of Landor's he introduces a 
new character Hannah Hathaway, and 
makes the poet's love for her the central inter- 
est of the play. He omits Landor's long dis- 
cussion upon divinity between the good justice 
and the culprit, and introduces a scene between 
the lovers. The author's humble acknowledg- 
ment of his indebtedness to Landor makes un- 
kind criticism impossible. " If the reader shall 
withhold from us all acknowledgment of orig- 
inality, let him at least at our instance turn 
again to Landor's work and refresh himself 
with his inimitable fancy." To draw readers to 
Landor may indeed be the chief service of this 
elegant book ; and it will be a worthy service. 
One could scarcely aspire to a better reward 
than to be remembered with the author of the 
" Imaginary Conversations." 

The "Brief for Plaintiff" in the case of 
" Bacon vs. Shakspere " is held by Mr. Edwin 
Reed, another member of the " Shakespeare So- 
ciety of New York." It was said of Francis of 
Verulam, " He writes philosophy like a Lord 
Chancellor." Of his " counsel " in the present 
case it may be said, " He writes literary criti- 
cism like a special pleader." Mr. Reed has the 
lawyer's faith in the virtue of authorities, but 
not the lawyer's discrimination as to their re- 



spective weight. He overwhelms the reader 
with obiter dicta of literary critics, whom he 
regards in the light of so many judges on the 
bench. Unfortunately, he sometimes resorts to 
devices upon which a pleader could not safely 
venture. One cannot always trust his citations. 
For example, Lowell remarks that certain 
things prove of Shakespeare that, k ' whatever 
the extent of his learning, the range and accu- 
racy of his knowledge were beyond precedent 
or later parallel." Omitting the important 
qualifying clause, " whatever the extent of his 
learning," Mr. Reed prints only the latter part 
of the sentence. Inasmuch as he is aiming to 
win his case rather than to bring out the truth, 
he deems it his cue to suppress the distinction 
between knowledge and learning, a distinc- 
tion so plainly emphasized by Lowell. This 
habit of mind deprives the book of much of the 
cogency and value which it might have had. 

The pleader assumes an antecedent improb- 
ability that the plays in question were written 
by William Shakespeare, " for he was unedu- 
cated "; and asserts that nearly all authorities 
concede their author to have been " a man of 
broad and varied scholarship." On the contrary, 
it is pretty generally agreed that the kind of 
knowledge exhibited in these marvellous dramas 
is not the kind which is properly to be called 
scholarship. Their author, whoever he may be, 
is, in the student's sense, almost as uncritical 
as the author of the book before us. William 
Shakespeare (supposing him to be the author 
of the plays) was evidently better versed in 
" the books, the arts, the academes " which he 
found in woman's eyes than in the severely 
limited curriculum of the grammar school at 
Stratford. And it is well for him and for us 
that this is so. Of the larger and humaner 
humanities which so far transcend mere schol- 
arship, and of which the great scholar is likely 
to be more ignorant than the unlettered, there 
was never a more accomplished master. That, 
without great knowledge of books, it is possible 
to be deeply read in human nature, is no more 
antecedently impossible in the case of Shake- 
speare than in that of Burns, or in that of 
Homer, who perhaps did not know the alpha- 
bet. Nor is there anything miraculous in the 
art of such a poet : it is simply a consummate 
adaptation of means to an end, and depends 
upon personal qualities which cannot be com- 
municated. " The art itself is nature," learn- 
ing cannot make it, though learning might, con- 
ceivably, mar it. 

It is not to be denied that Mr. Reed's book 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

has a certain interest. To gather and group in 
the form of a legal brief all the arguments and 
evidence in favor of the Baconian authorship 
of the plays was a happy conception, and it has 
been carried out with a good deal of brightness 
and plausibility. The book is the product of 
some industry, chiefly, perhaps, of the scis- 
sors- an d-paste variety. If, however, the author 
had always used the scissors, he might have 
better deserved our confidence. When he par- 
aphrases he is prone to inaccuracy, especially 
when (as is usually the case) a point is to be 
made. The example already cited is not the 
only one in which Lowell fares badly at his 
hands. He makes Lowell guilty of the follow- 
ing nonsense : " It is only in the ' whine of 
poets ' that the ' outward world was cold to 
him.' ' For what Lowell really said, see the 
last sentence of his " Shakespeare Once More." 

Mr. Reed never thinks of doubting his au- 
thorities, nor of verifying their statements. 
Disraeli, in his " Curiosities of Literature," had 
said : " Coke was exhibited on the stage for his 
ill usage of Rawleigh, as was suggested by 
Theobald in a note on Twelfth Night." Mr. 
Reed garbles this in quoting it, omitting the 
reference to Theobald, and placing that refer- 
ence in a footnote, so as to make it appear to 
be the result of his own research. In the trial 
of Raleigh, Coke had abusively said to the 
accused : " Thou viper ! for I thou thee, thou 
traitor ! " Sir Toby Belch, in his instructions 
to Sir Andrew about the challenge, remarks : 
" If thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not 
be amiss." Neither Theobald nor Disraeli had 
remarked that, as we know from Manningham's 
Diary, " Twelfth Night " had been acted nearly 
two years before Raleigh's trial. Of course 
Mr. Reed could not have been expected to look 
this fact up, for it is adverse to his theory that 
Bacon introduces this expression into Sir Toby's 
speech in covert satire of his rival, Coke. 

These examples of the carelessness and dis- 
ingenuousness of this author must suffice. After 
all, what else is to be expected of a book that 
is, on its face, a special plea ? It has the merit 
of condensing the whole argument for the Ba- 
conian authorship, and of putting all the points 
clearly and succinctly. But it will certainly 
mislead those who lack time and patience to 
verify references. The reckless method of the 
pleader is prlma facie evidence that his cause 
is bad. It may be confidently recommended 
to any careful reader who is unsettled in mind 
about the subject with which it deals, as tend- 
ing to confirm him in the orthodox faith. 



No better illustration could be desired of the 
difference between the method of tne sound 
scholar and that of the easy-going sciolist than 
is furnished by contrasting the book just con-* 
sidered with Mr. Bos well-Stone's " Shakspere's 
Holinshed." This is a work of great utility, 
which can be unreservedly commended both as 
to conception and as to execution. In this noble 
quarto of 532 pages, all the passages in the 
Chronicles which Shakespeare has made use of 
are reprinted in the original spelling with 
scrupulous exactitude. The parallel passages 
in the plays are either quoted or referred to. 
In cases like the archbishop's exposition of the 
title of Henry V. to the crown of France, the 
passages from the play and the chronicle are 
printed in parallel columns. Illustrations from 
other chroniclers, corrections due to the re- 
searches of modern historians (including Mr. 
Boswell-Stone himself), are plentifully fur- 
nished in the footnotes. The book is provided 
with an impressive list of " authorities referred 
to " and with a thorough index. The racy and 
fascinating old book to which Shakespeare owed 
most of his knowledge of English history, and 
upon which he makes boot so freely, is now 
placed within the reach of every student. 

For the illustration it affords of Shake- 
speare's, literary methods, this reprint of Hol- 
inshed is of course immensely interesting ; nor 
is it by any means devoid of interest in and 
for itself. No reader who loses himself in the 
quaint narrative of Holinshed will marvel at 
the fascination the Chronicles exercised upon 
the mind of the youthful Shakespeare. But no 
reader can regard with any feeling short of 
amazement these prosaic materials, in compari- 
son with the magnificent creations the dramatist 
contrived to evoke from them. To read Hol- 
inshed and Shakespeare together is like assist- 
ing at the erection of Pandemonium : 

" Anon out of the earth a fabric huge : 
Hose like an exhalation." 

The spectacle is more than instructive : it is 
exhilarating ! It shows how sufficient to the 
creative imagination are the commonest stuffs 
that life presents, and how simple are the meth- 
ods of genius. The question is often asked, 
" What do we know of Shakespeare ? " This 
book admits us into his workshop, and enables 
us to form as clear a notion of the way he 
worked as we have of the methods of Scott, of 
Goethe, of Tennyson, of Browning. In com- 
parison with such knowledge of him as this, the 
lost facts of his biography would be of small 
significance. MELVILLE B. ANDERSON. ,

THE LATEST GREAT HISTORY or GREECE.* 

When George Eliot, as a young woman re- 
coiling from the Evangelicalism of her girlhood, 
translated Strauss's " Leben Jesu," she urged, as 
a justifying motive, the conviction that Strauss 
" required to be read in England." We may 
assume that a similar conviction has induced 
certain scholars to produce an English version 
of Adolf Holm's "Griechische Geschichte," 
the first three volumes of which now lie before 
us. There was room in the English-speaking 
world for a new presentment of the story of 
Hellas. Of the classic triumvirate, Mitford, 
Thirlwall, and Grote, the first two loom more 
and more dim ; and even Grote's great work 
has passed its half -century, the first volumes 
having been issued in March, 1846. The artis- 
tic narrative of Curtius retains its high place as 
" the standard of fine feeling for the problems 
of Kulturgeschichte "/ Dr. Evelyn Abbott's 
history is a perspicuous account of the main 
streams of events ; and of monographs bearing 
on limited epochs there is no end, either in 
Germany or England. But here is an attempt 
to condense into four moderate volumes a com- 
pendious treatment of the whole field, and more, 
covered in the ten volumes of Mitford, the eight 
of Thirlwall, and the twelve of Grote. 

It may be said at once that the translation 
seems an excellent one. There are few traces 
of German idiom discernible ; and what may 
be called perfunctory English is rare. In the 
orthography of Greek proper names, the at- 
tempt to follow the traditional English spelling 
has been attended with some inconsistencies 
which recall Grote's " Socrates " and " Thucy- 
dides." In the matter of the Lesbian capital, 
the translators have apparently tried to play 
fair, giving it now " Mitylene," with the ma- 
jority of MSS., and again ' Mytilene," with the 
coins ; in the third volume the latter spelling 
has become fixed. Agrigentum (i., 360) and 
Akragas (i., 363), Selinus (ii., 166) and Se- 
linunto (ii., 167), Polycletus (ii., 168) and 
Polyclitus (ii., 273), Halonessus (iii., 227), 
Halonnessus (iii., 265), and De Halonneso 
(iii., 275), Tisamenus (i., 138), and Tisa- 
menes (i., 139), are confusions rather than 
compromises. We note some vexatious mis- 
prints: a misplaced comma after "Amphion " 
(i., 46) makes havoc of the sense ; Zethus ap- 
pears as " Lethus " ( i., 97 ), Dionysius as

" Dionysus" (i., 372), Polities as "Politics" (i., 
185) an error noticed by J. B. Bury in The 
Classical Review Greece as " Greek " (ii., 
3), Phrynichus as " Phrynicus " (ii., 11), Cor- 
onea as "Chaeronea" (ii., 194), Gylippus as 
"Cylippus" (ii., 415), ally as "alley" (iii., 
268). " Megapolitans " seems an unfortunate 
shortening of Megalopolitans ; and a reference 
to Them, i., 93 " (ii., 36) should obviously read 
Thuc. i., 93. 

There are a few slips in grammar. " Neither 
Diodorus . . . nor Plutarch are of importance " 
(ii., 74) escaped the proof-reader's eye, as per- 
haps did also " who can we prefer to him ? " (ii., 
325) ; and the following disjointed sentences, 
while grammatical, rattle like marbles in a bag : 

" Hippocrates, who had been successful in many things, 
did not succeed in the undertaking which he looked [sic] 
to bring him the greatest profit. He wished to take 
Syracuse. He actually defeated the Syracusans on the 
river Helorus, but could not take the city, owing to the 
interference of Corinth and Corcyra, who were united 
on this occasion. He obtained only the Syracusan col- 
ony of Camarina. He was killed in 491 B. C., in a war 
against the Sikelian Hybla. He was followed as ruler 
of Gela by his best general, Gelon, who succeeded in the 
great undertaking without even resorting to force " 
(ii., 79). 

We may add that in style and in freedom from 
such slips as those noted above, the third vol- 
ume is a great improvement on its predecessors. 

In the examination of these volumes, the 
absence of an index is keenly felt ; but of course 
the final volume will supply this temporary 
want. A graver deficiency is the absence of 
maps and charts, a form of help which Grote 
did not disdain, and which the best informed 
of readers would welcome. The lack of these 
essential aids to the understanding of such 
events as, e. g., the Sicilian campaign of 415- 
413 B.C., is a distinct drawback to the working 
value of the book. 

We have taken time and space to call atten- 
tion to defects which are, many of them, tri- 
fling enough, and which can readily be cor- 
rected in a second edition , but time and space 
are not at our command to praise adequately 
the merits of Professor Holm's work. His 
" Geschichte Siciliens " (1874) was an exhaus- 
tive and scholarly book, which has not been 
superseded by the freshness and vigor of a 
Freeman ; and those who had learned to rely 
on its winnowed learning and dispassionate 
judgments could with confidence expect equally 
satisfactory results in the larger field of Hel- 
lenic civilization. It is now eleven years since 
the first volume of Holm's " Griechische Ges- 
chichte " was issued by Calvary of Berlin. It 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



won recognition among scholars for its full 
possession and command of all the results of 
the latest investigations, its cool and indepen- 
dent estimates of measures and men, its fresh 
and original handling of venerable cruxes, and 
its compact and symmetrical grouping of the 
great epochs. This admiration was deepened 
by the succeeding volumes, in the last of which 
the author pushed the terminus of Greek his- 
tory from the usual date, 146 B. C., to the tri- 
umph of Octavian over Antony at Actium, 31 
B. C. The three volumes thus far translated 
bring the narrative down to the death of Alex- 
ander the Great. 

A striking feature of Holm's work is its 
interrogative note. He cleaves skilfully through 
a mixture of historical truth and traditional 
accretions with a series of posing questions 
which leave the known and the unknown on 
different sides. An example of the result of 
this treatment is his criticism (i., chap. 3) of 
Grote's " more or less detailed account of events 
in Greece before the Dorian migration, on the 
authority of the hero-myths and certain later 
traditions, to which a scientific value is 
ascribed." Starting with the preliminary ques- 
tion, " Is this method justifiable ? " Holm 
shows that in the absence of written records, 
oral tradition must misstate facts, and that this 
misstatement must increase with time. Homer 
he places not much before 800 B. C., and re- 
gards it as questionable whether these poems 
" really contain the traditions and recollections 
of the past which we have to consider as the 
basis of earliest Greek history." So with cere- 
monial traditions : 

" The light thrown upon the migrations of Greek 
races by the method of statistics and analysis of forms 
of worship has a larger amount of subjectivity than is 
desirable in history. But in truth every history is sub- 
jective which has any life in it and is not a mere col- 
lection of names; and the history of remote ages is the 
most subjective of all. The reader even demands sub- 
jectivity because he demands life. But he will also 
feel grateful to those who say: this little do we know, 
beyond it lies the region of possibility." 

Professor Holm recognizes in Herodotus 

" A consummate artist, who took such pains to de- 
scribe the East accurately that his contemporaries might 
know what it was like; it never entered his head to de- 
scribe the Greeks in the same fashion, for they of course 
were acquainted with their own ways. In Herodotus 
Greek life is indirectly revealed to the reader by means 
of the contrast it presents to the East" (ii., 287). 

He opposes the unfavorable view of Thucydides 
held by such scholars as Christ and Miiller- 
Striibing, and concludes that " on the whole, 
the old view that Thucydides is a truthful 



writer is not in the least shaken " (ii., 325). 
He finds in Xenophon's Hellenica " no trace of 
bias against the democracy " (ii., 508), though 
on page 534 he characterizes the concluding 
words of Book II., as " the more honorable a 
testimony to the Athenian democrats the far- 
ther removed the writer himself is from the 
democratic standpoint." 

In his lofty estimate of Alexander (whom 
he calls " a Greek in the fullest sense of the 
word"), and his worst -possible view of De- 
mosthenes, Professor Holm inevitably reminds 
us of the Caesar and Cicero of Mommsen's 
great History ; though Holm's condemnation 
of Demosthenes lacks that unhistorische Ge- 
reiztkeit with which Mommsen's treatment of 
Cicero has been justly reproached. 

In contrast to the prominence usually as- 
signed to the racial characteristics of the Dori- 
ans and lonians, Holm offers an ingenious sug- 
gestion (ii., 456 ff), which is, that " at least six 
different intellectual tendencies, which had been 
long in preparation, may be discerned among 
the Greeks of the three last decades of the fifth 
century : some of them just come in contact 
with one another, others are blended, and each 
proceeds from a distinct geographical centre." 
These are (we can only enumerate them here) 
the old Ionic culture, the .ZEolic, the Thracian, 
the Italian, the Sicilian, and the Attic. 

" The first of these is marked by a spirit of curious 
inquiry ; the second possesses depths of thought and feel- 
ing; the third is scientific; the fourth touches the ex- 
tremes of self-indulgence and self-renunciation; the fifth 
is acute and satirical. Athens assimilated something 
from each of them, but least of all from that of Lower 
Italy." 

Touches of a grim humor are not wanting ; as, 
for instance (referring to Philip's succession) : 

" It is true that Perdiccas' son, Amyntas, ought really 
to have taken over the government; but Philip was pow- 
erful, and his rival still a child, and in families of this 
kind they were never so very particular about such mat- 
ters. It was a great deal that Philip did not put his 
nephew to death. The omission was corrected by his 
son Alexander after his accession to the throne." 

Here is an allusion (iii., 179) which might 
better have been omitted : 

" The meetings of the [Athenian] Assembly were by 
no means so disorderly as to invite comparison with the 
sittings of certain modern Chambers of Deputies." 

The elaborate bibliographical notes at the 
end of each chapter are a striking evidence of 
the wide learning and controversial powers of 
the author, and form an apparatus which 
doubles the immediate usefulness of the book 
to all students of Greek history.

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF A FAMOUS 
MUSICIAN.* 



"The Early Correspondence of Hans von 
Billow " is a selection and translation, made by 
Constance Bache, from an edition which the 
musician's widow, Marie von Biilow, brought 
out something over a year ago in Germany. To 
be precise, the present edition contains one 
hundred and twenty letters, or just half the 
number in the German edition ; and of these, 
one hundred and four are by Biilow himself, 
while the remaining sixteen are from the pens 
of his father and mother, and the musicians 
Liszt, Wagner, and Berlioz. The translator 
urges that this selection was approved by Marie 
von Biilow ; that the letters omitted, " whilst in- 
teresting to Billow's fellow-countrymen, would 
hardly appeal to the general English reader," 
and that " at the same time nothing has been 
omitted that is of vital interest or importance 
in enabling us to understand the sequence of 
events which moulded Billow's youthful life and 
decided his career." But these numerous omis- 
sions limit the usefulness of the book, since the 
careful student will still be obliged to consult 
the complete German edition, and since even 
the general reader in many cases prefers to 
make his own selection. Otherwise the book 
is well planned, and even in this incomplete 
form it constitutes an invaluable autobiography 
of Biilow down to the beginning of his twenty- 
sixth year, when he had begun his remarkable 
career as a virtuoso. 

In reading this selection, then, one may start 
with the presumption that one is reading Billow 
at his best, and it may not be denied that this 
best is exceedingly good. The letters seem to 
have been written straight off on the spur of 
the moment, and are therefore entirely free 
from the faults usually found in letters written 
with the thought of publication in mind. For 
once, one is freed from the nightmare of nine- 
teenth century letter- writing ; there was no im- 
patient publisher standing behind Billow and 
darkening his page. It is true that Billow 
sometimes sacrificed form to spontaneity, but 
of this he himself was fully conscious. He said : 

" Amongst other things, I have the bad habit of hop- 
ping about from one thing to another in iny letters ; and 
because my pen cannot catch up my thoughts, in which 
there is occasionally a dearth, owing to a musical idea 
coming into my head between-times, I make the most

extraordinary leaps in all directions in what I write. It 
is all very well for me to determine to write a proper 
letter; in the most favourable case it only results in a 
larger and more careless note. I can't fix my mind on 
a continuous chain of thought, and wander about in a 
sort of anarchical way, from innate propensity." 

But this is just the sort of carelessness one 
likes to find in a letter, because then the play 
of thought is as free as it is in conversation. 
And a letter is, after all, only a little talk set 
down on paper. Thus the varied play of the 
emotions reveals with extraordinary clearness 
Billow's interesting personality. His thought 
is always in a glow, and he himself is always 
in extremes. " At one time tremendously cour- 
ageous," he writes, " at another endlessly apa- 
thetic and dejected." But although the depths 
which he sounds sometimes seem dark with de- 
spair, there is always a ray of humor to light 
up the gloom of his surroundings. The ray is 
often a " dull, imprisoned " one, and the humor 
is often of the Jacques order ; but their presence 
is undeniable. Then at the least change of cir- 
cumstance he rises to where all is light, showing 
that by nature he was cheerful and enthusiastic. 
At such times his letters are not infrequently 
filled with noble and lofty sentiments. 

But no matter what be the mood of the mo- 
ment, there is everywhere traceable in Billow's 
letters an absolute allegiance to art. It was this 
devotion to art which made him flee from his 
father's home at Otlishausen and undertake 
that journey to Wagner at Zurich, in order to 
test whether he had " the energy to do that 
piece on foot in the most awful weather, amid 
ceaseless rain and storm," and later on write 
these resolute words to his father : 

" I have become a man by my own energetic act. I 
have a conscience and a conviction, upon which I con- 
sistently act, and I think these ought to be respected by 
everyone. I am a musician, and intend to remain one." 

The flight from Otlishausen may be called the 
turning-point in his career, for by this action 
he cast off the fetters of a profession which was 
in every way distasteful to him, and chose one 
for which he was in every way fitted, beginning 
at the same time a friendship that was as last- 
ing as it was beneficial in his subsequent career 
as a musician. 

That the friendship thus begun between 
Wagner and Billow was mutual, and that the 
former regarded his youthful follower with sin- 
cere love and respect, may be seen from the 
candid and plain-spoken letter sent to Billow's 
mother for the purpose of reconciling her to 
her son's choice of a profession. On the other 
hand, everyone knows of Billow's devotion to

the master of Baireuth, that most abused and 
least understood of musicians. His letters are 
filled with warm expressions of love for the 
man and admiration for the musician. His 
early success as a conductor, for which he even 
then showed an undeniable talent, was directly 
due to Wagner's instruction. But another phase 
of Wagner's potent influence soon began to ap- 
pear. As early as January, 1851, Billow wrote 
to his sister of his great respect for Wagner. 

" I do not know if you can understand it, but it is 
through this respect, which necessitates also an under- 
standing of his works, that I really came to my right self. 
I have become more and more conscious that this esteem, 
this understanding, is the best germ in me, the one 
by means of which, if properly fostered by me, I shall 
become a man who fills a distinct place in the world, 
and in humanity." 

Here, then, was the birth of the idea by whose 
expression Billow meant to show his fellow-men 
that he had a distinct mission to fulfil, to which 
he devoted the best powers of his mind and the 
best years of his life, thus drawing down upon 
himself much of the abuse that had been heaped 
upon Wagner. 

Billow, however, was not the first to enter 
the lists in defence of Wagner's work, for the 
great Liszt had preceded him. And perhaps 
the friendship between Liszt and Billow was 
even more intimate than that between Wagner 
and Billow, though it was not of so rapid a 
growth. That it was a real friendship, in spite 
of differences in age and attainment, is proven 
by the many incidents of their companionship 
which these letters record. During his stay at 
Weimar, Billow gave himself over completely 
to Liszt's direction, and allowed himself to be 
" be-Weimared," as he expressed it. Indeed, 
so inseparable were the two that a caricature of 
the time represented Liszt as Don Quixote and 
Billow as Sancho Panza. It would be impos- 
sible to overestimate the influence which Liszt 
as a musician exerted on Billow, because he did 
for him as a pianist even more than Wagner 
had done for him as a conductor. Liszt's plan 
was to have Billow remain at Weimar for one 
year and prepare an extensive repertoire for 
his concert tours, since his immediate career 
was to depend on his executive talent. He was 
also to learn to write for the piano. What 
Billow saw and imitated in Liszt's method is 
suggested in a letter to his father in May, 1852. 
"The great mastership of Liszt apart from his 
individual appearance and personality rests princi- 
pally on his marvellously expansive and manifold power 
of expressing outwardly what he feels inwardly; not 
merely in the perception and grasp of a musical work, 
but in the way he can reproduce it outwardly, the extra- 



ordinarily faithful embodiment of the spiritual. Noth- 
ing is further from him than calculated effects; his 
genius as an artist consists chiefly in his certainty of the 
effect he gives so brilliantly at every performance. This 
point in Liszt seems to me the most worthy because the 
most possible of imitation, and I have tried for some 
time, and not without result, to copy him somewhat in 
this." 

And at the end of his stay at Weimar, which 
had been considerably prolonged, Billow had so 
caught the spirit of Liszt's methods of execu- 
tion that Liszt wrote of him : " Je le reconnais 
comme mon successeur legitime, comme mon he- 
ritier de par la grace de Dieu et de son talent." 

But even such unqualified praise as this was 
not sufficient to bring at once to the young 
musician the success which Liszt had predicted 
and which he certainly deserved. His early 
concerts were rather costly experiments from a 
financial standpoint, and nearly all of them left 
him extremely depressed in both spirit and 
purse. But while the letters of the time are 
filled with expressions of bitter discontent, he 
never quite forgot the humor of his situation. 
What time he could he spent in reading Balzac 
in order, as he says, " to take the bitter edge 
off irony, and to settle all its elements of fer- 
mentation down into a non-effervescent hu- 
mour." Finally, however, criticism changed to 
enthusiasm ; and one of his well-earned rewards 
was an appointment, early in 1855, as principle 
teacher of pianoforte at Stern and Marx's Con- 
servatorium in Berlin. 

Shortly after this event the correspondence 
comes to a close. While the story told is a 
short one, the years which it covers are in some 
respects the most important, as they are with- 
out doubt the most interesting, of Billow's life. 
It was during this period that his character was 
formed, and to a considerable extent developed ; 
and in his early correspondence, therefore, one 
may see foreshadowed many of the eccentrici- 
ties that characterized the later life of a man 
whom many chose to receive with contempt and 
derision. TULEY FRANCIS HUNTINGTON. 



PROF. MICHAEL BERNAYS, formerly of Munich, and 
one of the greatest interpreters of German classical poe- 
try, died in Karlsruhe on the 25th of February. He was 
a scholar of fine literary sensitiveness, and was endowed 
with remarkable histrionic gifts and with a memory 
little short of marvellous. Because of this phenomenal 
memory, Bernay's knowledge of facts was astounding, 
and he was a veritable encyclopaedia of knowledge on 
universal literature. The weight of this erudition 
seemed to be a burden upon his productive powers, and 
he seemed ever to be absorbing rather than creating. 
He has, however, given to the world several works of 
considerable literary value and importance.

CENTRED osr BIBLE STUDY.* 



The market is overloaded with stock for the 
Bible student ; and the products are easily 
assortable into several classes. To a general 
class belongs the somewhat miscellaneous work 
entitled " The Bible as Literature." Professor 
Moulton's popularity as a lecturer, and his new 
series "The Modern Reader's Bible," have 
begun to reveal to some people the fact that 
the Bible is not simply a religious book, but 
that it is full of masterpieces of literature. The 
fact that it has been hedged in by reverence 
has been by some enthusiastic though narrow 
religionists sufficient ground for excluding it 
from the common field of literature. This sym- 
posium for such it is on different themes, 
books, and sections of the Bible, is a direct 
campaign against such a " hands-off " spirit. It 
purports to discuss the Bible as literature pure 
and simple. Professor Moulton leads off with 
a keen and discriminative article on the title of 
the book. Nineteen chapters by eighteen au- 
thors make up the body of the book ; and the 
closing article, on "the influence of biblical 
upon modern English literature," is by Pro- 
fessor A. S. Cook of Yale. The discussions, 
by some of the leading professors and Bible 
scholars of America, touch several degrees of 
worth, some even running quite wide of the 
general purpose of the book, and possessing 
little real value. On the Old Testament, two 
treatments, " The Book of Job as Literature," 
by Professor Genung of Amherst College, and 
" The Love-song of the Bible," by Dr. W. E. 
Griffis, are masterly condensations of what 
could be said of the literary beauty and value 
of the respective books. Of the six articles on 
the New Testament, special attention may be 
called to that on " the epistles of Paul as liter- 
ature " by Professor George B. Stevens of Yale

University. Though this is becoming a fash- 
ionable method of making books, we greatly 
doubt its real value to the thoughtful public. 

It is distinctly appetizing to find a writer who 
leaves the beaten paths of theory and practice 
in the making of books on special themes. 
Dr. Caverno has indeed a very " narrow ax," 
and it cuts deep into the vitals of biblical criti- 
cism. The microscopic nicety and the theoretic 
presumptions of many modern biblical critics 
are cuffed about by a man who takes large and 
comprehensive views of literature and interpre- 
tation. It is evident that the author has not 
kept posted on the latest literature on the topics 
touched ; but this works no ill for his methods 
of interpretation. They are generally sound to 
the core, laid on broad principles, and carried 
out on common-sense plans. Facts not theories, 
literary not hypothetical principles, must un- 
derlie all criticism which anticipates reaching 
the truth. This is a keen, spicy, original book, 
with some degree of usefulness ahead of it. 

The aids to Teacher's Bibles, which formerly 
could easily be bound in the same covers with 
the Bible, have so increased in bulk as to de- 
mand their own covers. " Bible Illustrations " 
is a handy volume, made up entirely of 124 
plates with descriptive text. These plates are 
largely new, and are each full-page. They give 
us beautiful facsimiles and reproductions from 
photographs of famous Bible manuscripts of the 
Old Testament and the New, of all the import- 
ant versions in which it has been handed down 
to us. Then sample pages of early English ver- 
sions are of peculiar interest to every student 
of the Bible. The religion of the Egyptians 
is illustrated by several pages of cuts from the 
land of the Nile. Egyptian life and customs are 
also quite tastefully pictured. The great civ- 
ilizations of Assyria and Babylonia contribute 
portraits of some of the kings whose shocks of 
battle shook Israel and her land. Roman em- 
perors also stare at us from some of the later 
plates. The whole volume is commendable in 
form, substance, and method of presentation. 

The new " Illustrated Bible Treasury " 
reaches the acme in the field of Bible students' 
helps. Dr. Wright had the assistance of twenty- 
eight British and nine American scholars, many 
of them eminent specialists in the particular 
themes upon which they wrote. Among these 
we may mention Professors A. B. Davidson, 
Marcus Dods, J. Rendel Harris, W. M. Ram- 
say, and J. F. McCurdy, Dr. Ed. Naville, Dr. 
A. H. Sayce, Dr. George Adam Smith, Canon 
Tristram, and Dr. B. B. Warfield. The cata-

logue of themes treated and the compactness 
and lucidity of the articles are a delight to the 
reader. The wealth of illustrations of the best 
sort not old worn-out cuts adds greatly 
to the beauty and completeness of the articles. 
The natural-history sections are especially fine 
in matter and make-up. The Concordance is 
the most complete yet produced, being adapted 
both to the Authorized and to the Revised Ver- 
sions, and containing also proper names. We 
also find incorporated in it several themes which, 
in other helps, are found merely in separate 
sections under the dry uninteresting form of 
tables. Some of these are Messianic Prophecy, 
Parables in the Old Testament, Quotations in 
the New Testament for the Old. This feature 
simplifies the Bible student's task. The full 
dozen of new up-to-date maps, fully colored and 
indexed, are superb. The entire book, printed 
on thin paper, so that it is less than one inch 
thick, is elegantly bound in leather, with red 
under gold edges, and is nearest the ideal Bible 
student's manual of any publication in its field. 
The histories of Israel are legion, and he is 
a rare man indeed who thinks that he can 
improve upon his predecessors. The second 
volume of Dr. Kent's " History of the Hebrew 
People " is a small book printed in large type, 
severely condensed and rigorously modern in 
views and treatment. Its raison d'etre seems 
to be its use of the latest utterances of special- 
ists on the vital points and periods of Israel's 
history and literature. The author is quite free 
to state without qualification results which can 
be said to be as yet mere theories (cf. for ex- 
ample sections 23, 24 latter part, 164, 167, 
168, 171, 188). He is in full sympathy with 
such writers as Driver and his school. The 
blocking-out of the material seems to be fittingly 
done ; and the separate- section method of dis- 
cussion gives a kind of continuity to the story. 
While the work has marks of value, it is open 
to criticism at one essential point. It is appar- 
ently intended for the beginning student's use ; 
but for such it is too condensed. It must be 
supplemented by larger and more complete 
works. It should contain references to such, 
in some accessible place. Again, it is not what 
scholars, to whom all of its facts are familiar, 
need. Its material yields no new facts. But 
the one class to which it may be of value is 
that of the Bible student reasonably familiar 
with the Old Testament, who desires to ascer- 
tain the standing ground of the modern advance 
school of criticism as touching the history of the 
Hebrew people. IRA M. PRICE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Life and letters two handsome volumes contain- 

of a distinguished ing the " Life and Letters of William 
American educator. Barton Rogers," edited by his wife 
and published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 
present two distinct claims upon our interest. First, 
it brings us into sympathetic communion with a 
remarkable group of brothers, who, about the mid- 
dle of this century, occupied an important position 
as teachers and scientists. The four sons of Pat- 
rick Kerr Rogers, a professor in William and Mary's 
College in Virginia, all graduates thereof, were long 
notable in educational circles as the Rogers brothers. 
James was professor of chemistry in the University 
of Pennsylvania ; Henry acquired fame as conductor 
of the geological survey of Pennsylvania, and was 
afterwards professor of natural history at Glasgow ; 
Robert succeeded James in the chair of chemistry 
in the University of Pennsylvania, and held a sim- 
ilar place in the Jefferson Medical College in Phil- 
adelphia ; while William Barton is the central fig- 
ure in this portrayal. He was born in Philadelphia 
in 1804 ; succeeded his father as professor of nat- 
ural philosophy in William and Mary's College in 
1828 ; was appointed to the conduct of the geolog- 
ical survey of Virginia in 1835 ; and in the same year 
was transferred to the chair of natural philosophy in 
the University of Virginia. This position he re- 
signed in 1853, removing to Boston, where his 
brother Henry was already lecturing. This closed 
the first period of his professional career, in which 
his reputation as an investigator and an instructor 
had been fully established. Were the records here 
closed, and the estimate of his character, ability, 
and success made up, his place would have been 
found in the first class of American physicists. But 
and here arises the second and largest claim upon 
our interest his removal to Boston was the en- 
trance upon a new phase of labor whose results quite 
eclipse his preceding achievements. From now on, 
his memoir is an account of the inception, the de- 
velopment, and the early success of the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology. As early as 1846, 
the brothers William and Henry sketched a plan of 
a school of technology, to be located in Boston ; but 
the conditions were not then favorable, and the 
scheme lay in abeyance until 1859. By this time 
the State had filled the basin of shallow water near 
Boston known as the Back Bay, and Governor Banks 
had intimated in his annual message that the oppor- 
tunity was favorable for some important educational 
enterprise to be benefited by the proceeds. In the 
sequel, several scientific associations were made ben- 
eficiaries ; but doubtless the most notable result was 
the founding of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, of which it may be said that, while its plan 
was largely original, its nearest prototype was the 
famous Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, in Paris. 
The organization was made with wise deliberation, 
in which the broad views entertained by Professor 
Rogers were ever directive, and at no time met any

serious opposition. In February, 1865, the first 
class was assembled in temporary quarters ; in Nov- 
ember of the same year, Dr. Rogers was formally 
made president ; and in 1866 a commodious and 
costly building was occupied. In 1868 he retired 
from the presidency because of ill health ; he re- 
turned temporarily at the resignation of Doctor 
Runkle, in 1878, pending the election of a successor, 
who was found in 1881 in the person of General 
Francis A. Walker. On Tuesday, May 30, 1882, 
while Dr. Rogers was speaking at the graduating 
exercises of the Institute, he wavered for an instant, 
then fell to the platform, dead. As to time, place, 
and circumstance, he could not have wished a more 
fitting departure. In the foundation of the Insti- 
tute by President Rogers, three fundamental prin- 
ciples were never lost sight of : First, it should not 
be affiliated with any other institution ; second, its 
instruction should be adapted not to boys but men ; 
third, its equipments should be of the fittest and its 
teachers of the largest calibre. In its development 
the Institute has been fortunate in securing adequate 
funds as needed, without being hampered by the 
name or the fancies of any person. As a result it 
has secured the commanding position it now enjoys, 
without a peer in this country or a superior in any. 

The United state* In " The Nicaragua Canal and the 
and the Nicaragua Monroe Doctrine " (Putnam), Pro- 
Canai project. fesgor Keasbey, of Bryn Mawr Col- 
lege, describes the plans for crossing the narrow but 
elevated ridge which unites the two Americas, and 
shows the tangled web of diplomacy woven about 
the claims of the United States regarding an enter- 
prise of such momentous import. Ever since Bal- 
boa's astonished gaze descried from an isthmian cor- 
dillera the sheen of the southern sea, explorers and 
engineers have dreamed of finding some depression 
through which the barrier could be passed, so that 
Pacific ports could be reached more directly than by 
the long circuit of the southern cape. By as many 
as eight different routes, supposed to be feasible by 
canal or railway, and by more than twenty variants, 
solutions of the problem have been proposed, among 
which only the Panama railway has been completed. 
The wish has been to find transit for fully-laden 
ocean steamships, and the hope was for such transit 
at the sea level, as in the Suez Canal. Of all the 
various schemes, but two have survived for present 
discussion. One, the Panama Canal, was to have 
been finished by now, after the removal of 176 
millions of cubic yards of material, at a cost of 120 
millions of dollars. After six years of labor, two- 
fifths of the work was done at a cost of 262 mil- 
lions of dollars, of which it has been said " one third 
was used legitimately, one third was squandered, 
and one third was stolen," followed by a ruin of 
reputations without a parallel in modern times. But 
the Panama scheme has not been abandoned. For 
the open tide-water channel, first proposed, it now 
substitutes at the summit a high level to be reached 
by locks. It is estimated to require an added ex- 



penditure of 200 millions of dollars. The Nicaragua 
plan proposes to utilize the lake of that name, the 
level of whose waters is 110 feet above that of the 
oceans, and is to be reached by four locks on each 
side. About eighteen miles of canal are to be con- 
structed upon the Pacific side, and thirty-one miles 
on the Atlantic side. The total distance, including 
lake navigation, is 174 miles. The estimated cost 
is 133 millions of dollars. In view of the sums used 
in the grand enterprises which the United States 
has already brought to successful issue, this amount, 
though large, is not prohibitory. The chief obstacle 
to immediate progress in this well-perfected scheme 
seems to be the involved diplomacy which invests 
the attempt, hardly yet to be deemed successful, to 
bring the enterprise under the protection of the 
United States behind the aegis of the Monroe Doc- 
trine. The history of this controversy, as outlined 
by Professor Keasbey too fully to be briefly epi- 
tomized, shows how often the Monroe Doctrine has 
been put forward, and how often it has been per- 
mitted silently to retire under the pressure of shrewd 
diplomacy or vigorous protest, leaving it now doubt- 
ful whether concessions, weakly or ignorantly made, 
have not committed the nation beyond the oppor- 
tunity of honorable retraction. Professor Keasbey's 
volume is timely, and indicates thorough and con- 
scientious investigation. 

The first four of Mr. Joseph Jacobs's 
Semi-journalistic < < Literary Studies" (Scribner) ap-

peared in an earlier volume, while 
all of them were originally published in either " The 
Athenaeum " or " The Academy," being in the na- 
ture of obituaries " written within the two or three 
days that elapsed between the death of their sub- 
jects and the appearance of the ensuing issue " of 
the paper to which they were contributed. The 
longest and best of the studies is the first, which is 
an appreciative review of George Eliot's works. 
That the author of " Daniel Deronda " and " The 
Spanish Gypsy " should have appealed with peculiar 
power to the writer of " An Inquiry into the Sources 
of the History of the Jews in Spain " is not difficult 
to understand. Essays on Matthew Arnold, Brown- 
ing, and Newman make up the remainder of the 
first edition of this little book, and are already 
familiar to many readers. The last three chapters 
are new, in book form, and are devoted to Tennyson, 
R. L. Stevenson, and Sir John Seeley. Tennyson's 
supremacy in lyric poetry and his limitations in epic 
and dramatic composition limitations arising 
chiefly from his secluded mode of life and the aris- 
tocratic reserve of his nature are clearly set forth ; 
but the writer is unduly severe in his criticism of 
the " Idylls of the King." This epic, which Mr. 
Stedman has called " Tennyson's master-work . . . 
suffused with the Tennysonian glamour of golden 
mist," Mr. Jacobs regards as little better than a 
failure, and claims that for epic poetry Tennyson's 
powers, " great as they were, were inadequate. He 
was not an epic poet." His strictures upon the

dramas will meet with less dissent than will hia treat- 
ment of the " Idylls " and what he calls their " some- 
what namby-pamby chivalry." The essay has some 
keen analysis, and explains well the reasons of Ten- 
nyson's being both the people's and the poets' poet. 
The article on Stevenson is only eleven pages long, 
but is good. That it is highly eulogistic, goes with- 
out saying ; for who that has written about Steven- 
son has not written in his praise? Mr. Jacobs's 
strong preference for what he calls the novelists of 
out-of-door life to the other school of " Howells and 
James young men," is very apparent. Yet we may 
question whether the verdict of coming decades and 
centuries will agree with this critic in placing " Dr. 
Jekyll " beside the " Pilgrim's Progress " and " Gul- 
liver's Travels," " as one of the three great allego- 
ries in English." Mr. Jacobs's volume is an attrac- 
tive one, and is worthy of a place perhaps beside 
Mr. Lang's " Essays in Little " and Mr. Hutton's, 
Mr. Henley's, and Mr. Woodberry's literary studies. 

The recently published Memoirs of 
Mgr. de Salamon," an historical doc- 
ume nt that has awakened the liveliest 
interest in France, now appears in an English ver- 
sion (Little, Brown, & Co.). The author of the 
Memoirs was a clerical counsellor in the Paris Par- 
lement, a position which he owed to his appointment 
by Pius VI. as Internuncio at Paris in 1790 ; and 
his narrative extends from that date to 1801. The 
Memoir is divided into three parts. The first part 
treats of the narrator's imprisonment at the Abbaye 
during the September massacres, and of his narrow 
escape from the butchery of which he was an eye- 
witness. No similar narrative of these events that 
we know of exceeds that of the Abbe in realistic 
force and unmistakable literal truth of detail. The 
second portion deals with the Chambre des Vaca- 
tions, of which the Abbd de Salamon was a member, 
and before which suits were brought in the interval 
created by the suppression of the Parlements. Dur- 
ing this period the author was proscribed by Robes- 
pierre's satellites, and the chapters he devotes to his 
pursuit and escape afford a vivid impression of the 
conditions under the Terror. Portion three relates 
to events under the Directory, Mgr. de Salamon's 
correspondence with the Pope leading to his arrest, 
trial, and final acquittal. The Abbess recital is tell- 
ingly simple and naively circumstantial, manifestly 
exact as to fact, but colored, of course, as to esti- 
mates of men and events with the writer's personal 
and official prejudices. He adds his mite to the 
now pretty conclusive mass of evidence that the 
September massacres were the work, planned, paid, 
and systematically carried out, of the Commune. 
On leaving the prison, after the butchery was 
finished, the Abbe* saw through a window a member 
of that body, in his tricolor scarf, with some bags of 
money beside him, engaged in paying the assassins. 
" The wages of those who had ' worked well,' that is 
to say, 'massacred well,' was from thirty to thirty-five 
francs. A certain number had to be content with 



European 



less. There was one who obtained only six francs. 
His labor had been considered very insufficient. It 
was a horrible spectacle to see those wretches argu- 
ing which of them had done the most butchery. . . . 
I saw also a woman, who must have been whelped 
in hell, insult a corpse. She was astride of it, and 
shouted, ' Look how fat this dog of a calotin was ! ' ' 
One regrets that Rousseau did not live to see his 
precious " sovereign " exercising its prerogative and 
demonstrating its " virtues." The book is furnished 
with a rather profuse editorial apparatus of notes, 
introduction, appended documents, etc., and there is 
a frontispiece portrait of the author. 

^ general work upon European pre- 
historic archaeology, which shall tell 
archeology. simply and well, not only what was 

well told a dozen years ago, but also the discoveries 
of recent years, is a desideratum. Such a book must, 
of course, be abundantly and well illustrated. We 
can hardly say of Mr. H. N. Hutchinson's " Pre- 
historic Man and Beast " ( Appleton) that it meets 
the need described. It is fairly interesting, but con- 
tains little that is new, even in British archaeology, 
and that little is badly told. After presenting the 
already pretty well known facts regarding palaeo- 
lithic man of the gravels and of the caverns the 
author wastes sixty pages in a tirade against extreme 
ideas in glacial geology, which have not needed to be 
combated for a decade of years. The author is care- 
less and repetitive. Thus, he twice touchingly refers 
in identical terms to " Prof. T. McKenny Hughes, 
from whom we learned much at Cambridge "; again, 
he three times ( pp. 17, 46, 138 ) suggests that 
some biblical chronology claims that the world is 
4000 years old a very strange idea. The author's 
statements are often discordant, as (p. 97) " Pro- 
fessor James Geikie in his Great Ice Age ' (1894) 
gives a coloured map showing its huge dimensions 
according to his theory "; (p. 86) " Professor James 
Geikie has now (1889) abandoned his theory." In 
his list of works of reference, Mr. Hutchinson omits 
de Mortillet's, Le Prehistorique, perhaps the most 
important popular work upon his subject; other 
nearly as bad omissions might be named. There 
are ten full -page plates in the book before us, 
intended to reconstruct the life of prehistoric men, 
which, were they not saddening, would be amusing. 
The author's attitude toward the illustrations may 
be shown by two quotations. His frontispiece rep- 
resents a " happy family " composed of a sabre-tooth 
tiger, a cave-bear, and hyenas, advancing to attack 
a cave-dwelling family. Mr. Hutchinson admits the 
incongruity of such a combination of forces, but 
naively remarks: "It makes a more interesting 
picture, and scientific accuracy may in some cases be 
pushed too far. Artistic effect has also to be consid- 
ered." Again, in mentioning the picture representing 
the building of Stonehenge, he congratulates himself 
upon a new hint as to method of moving the great 
stones supplied by Mr. Read in these words : " We 
are greatly obliged for this excellent suggestion, es-

pecially as a long embankment " (demanded by the 
other suggested method of work) " would spoil the 
composition of the picture." With entirely kindly 
feeling toward the author, we cannot say that Mr. 
Hutchinson's book is a valuable contribution to its 
field. 

The publication of Lord Leighton's 
Lo^d Leighton (l R j Academy Addresses " (Long- 

and his addresses. J J . , 

mans) will not alter the general esti- 
mate of his character. They were delivered bien- 
nially as President of the Royal Academy, during 
the last twenty years ; and although a compara- 
tively small number ever heard or read them, yet 
their general character trickled out, as it were, into 
the wider constituency that knew or admired Lord 
Leighton. The president of an academy holds a 
singularly difficult position. By the very nature of 
the case, he can hardly be other than conservative : 
and conservatism in art has more attraction for 
prigs and sycophants and weaklings than for such 
as really need it. It is also difficult to avoid the 
temptation to become merely ornamental: and 
artists, although they love beauty, are apt to decry 
the most exquisite figure-heads if found in their own 
profession. Lord Leighton was somewhat conserv- 
ative, and singularly ornamental : he was by nature 
a P.R.A. In life, therefore, he was peculiarly open 
to the shafts of satire ; nor will this volume in any 
respect serve as a buckler. Lord Leighton's ad- 
dresses have called forth much unkind criticism ; 
they have been called rigmarole, opulent disquisi- 
tions, and what not, and certainly, as one now 
reads them over, they offer a certain reason for such 
terms. But such abuse shows one side only. Lord 
Leighton was not a creative power, a moulding 
force, an artistic influence : admit so much, and you 
are free to recognize what he was namely, a man 
of broad culture and learning, of remarkable gifts 
in many lines, and of many accomplishments, even 
a man of devotion to artistic ideals, and if not great 
as an artist, certainly great as a connoisseur and a 
lover of art. His addresses will be compared with 
those of Sir Joshua Reynolds ; and the comparison 
is of interest. Sir Joshua discussed general ideas, 
and what he said may still be read with profit. 
Lord Leighton deals chiefly with the history of art, 
and wisely, for he was as learned as he was bril- 
liant. His work certainly lacks some things that we 
should value, but it has at least that quality which 
comes from the assured handling of a great and 
inspiring subject. 

A volume of " English Studies " by 
" tne late James Darmesteter, trans- 
lated into English by his devoted 
widow (who signs herself " Mary James Darmes- 
teter " for her French public, but whom English 
poetry knows as Miss Mary Robinson), has recently 
been published by Mr. Fisher Unwin. The volume 
is a delightful one for a number of reasons. First, 
because it gives us a portrait of the author ; second, 
because the prefatory pages contributed by Madame 



Darmesteter contain one of the most delicate and 
charming characterizations that we have ever read ; 
third, because Darmesteter never wrote anything 
that was not interesting. Having said thus much in 
praise of the volume, it is permissible to add that 
these " English Studies " are among the slighter 
things of the author's literary output, and that, charm- 
ing as they are, one can get from them no adequate 
idea of Darmesteter's scholarship or of his powers 
as a thinker. The " Studies " deal with such themes 
as " Joan of Arc in England," " The French Rev- 
olution and Wordsworth," George Eliot, Mary Rob- 
inson, and Irish poetry. Three oriental studies are 
appended, one of them being a somewhat lengthy 
paper on " Calcutta." It need hardly be added that 
the translator has done about all that art can do to 
preserve the aroma of Darmesteter's style. But we 
cannot quite forgive her for her f requent use of the 
affectations " 't was " and " 't is." 



An eminent Miss Alice Brown's " Mercy War- 

Coioniai ren," forming the fourth volume in 

blue-stocking. the Women of Colonial and Revo- 
lutionary Times " series (Scribner), is a readable 
and instructive sketch of a noted blue-stocking of 
the period. Mercy Warren, by her maiden name 
Mercy Otis, was the sister of James Otis, the wife 
of James Warren of Plymouth (a sound patriot, 
of the excellent stock of the "Mayflower" War- 
rens), and the friend and correspondent of John 
Adams and other notabilities of the day. Mrs. 
Warren was a rather voluminous writer, prolix, 
stilted, and pedantic. Her magnum opus was, of 
course, her " History of the Revolution." Her pen 
occasionally stooped to humor, and she was the au- 
thor of an acting farce entitled " The Group." Of 
the deadly properties of Mrs. Warren's lighter vein 
we get an inkling in a letter of hers " playfully " 
hinting that certain overdue letters may have been 
lost at sea : " But if most of them as is probable are 
Devoted to the Oozy Nymphs who attend the Watry 
God below it may serve as an Interlude amidst the 
variety of political packages consigned to their 
perusal in these Days of danger and uncertainty." 
Of Mrs. Warren's literary ventures the present au- 
thor gives an interesting account that forms a very 
suggestive episode in the annals of early American 
literature. Miss Brown's little book is pleasantly 
written and deftly put together, and forms perhaps 
the most solidly instructive volume thus far of the 
capital little series to which it belongs. 



Forms of 
land-holding 
in India. 



The common view among writers on 
social institutions is that the " joint- 
village " is the prevalent type through- 
out India, and that " land held in common " is the 
rule. Mr. Baden- Powell's book on " The Indian 
Village-Community " (Longmans) is a vast accumu- 
lation of facts regarding Indian villages, gathered 
from every source, and marshalled in such a way as 
to indicate that the joint-village with common hold- 
ing of land (except where the latter is the result of 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



225 



some special voluntary association) is only traceable 
among the superior tenures of the Hindu Aryans 
and the later tribes who settled in northern or upper 
India. The author claims that in the great majority 
of cases the so-called joint-village followed rather 
than preceded the village of separate holdings. He 
goes little into arguments or conclusions : to pre- 
sent the facts is his chief aim. After a brief state- 
ment regarding the Indian village and its forms in 
general, two chapters are devoted to the "Physi- 
ography of India "in its relations to land tenure, 
and to "Ethnographic Considerations." The re- 
maining chapters discuss forms of land-holding in 
different parts of India. The author finds nine 
varieties of villages, each with some peculiarity in 
tenure. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The new " Cambridge " edition of " The Complete 
Poetical Works of James Russell Lowell," published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., leaves nothing to be 
desired. It is uniform with the other single-volume 
" Cambridge " editions of our chief American poets, and 
extends to nearly five hundred double-column pages. 
The portrait is a singularly attractive one, and Mr. 
Horace E. Scudder's " Biographical Sketch " is a model 
composition of its sort. The notes are Lowell's own, 
as found in the earlier editions, or as extracted from Mr. 
Norton's edition of Lowell's " Letters." The text com- 
prises that contained in the four volumes of the " Riv- 
erside " edition, and in the thin volume of " Last Poems " 
edited by Mr. Norton. 

Miss Agnes Godfrey Gay has compiled for American 
children a volume of " Chansons, Poe*sies, et Jeux Fran- 
c,ais " (Jenkins) that we take pleasure in commending, 
although we cannot pardon the error of judgment that 
has led to the suppression of mute syllables in the songs 
that are set to music. The book contains many singing 
games, besides such classical pieces as Adam's " Noel " 
and " La Marseillaise," and provides also a number of 
poems for children, ranging all the way from nonsense 
jingles to Hugo's " Dieu est toujours Ik." 

Dr. Smith's " Smaller History of Greece " (Harper), 
which has been deservedly popular in American schools 
for over thirty years, is now republished in a revised 
edition, prepared by Mr. Carleton L. Brownson. There 
is no change in the fundamental plan of the work, 
although the text has been largely rewritten, and ex- 
tended by about twenty per cent. There are new maps, 
plans, and pictures, and new chapters on the constitu- 
tional history, topography, and monuments of Athens. 
The full treatment of the two centuries following Chsero- 
nea is a noteworthy feature of the work in its present form. 

Professor Tarr of Cornell University has just pub- 
lished, through the Macmillan Co., an " Elementary 
Geology " which forms a worthy companion book to his 
earlier " Elementary Physical Geography," and which 
we take pleasure in recommending to school authorities 
as one of the very best texts to be had. Almost for the 
first time, we have here a book in which the strate- 
graphic branch of the subject is not given two or three 
times the attention that it relatively deserves. The 
book is beautifully made, and its illustrations are as 
fresh and attractive as any we have seen for many a day. 



IiITEBARY NOTES. 

Messrs. Maynard, Merrill, & Co. publish a selected 
volume of Hawthorne's " Twice-Told Tales " for use as 
a school text. 

Mr. J. Fred Smith is the author of a new " School 
Geometry," inductive in plan, published by Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co. 

Dr. Fridtjof Nansen has been engaged by the Red- 
path Lyceum Bureau for a series of lectures to be given 
in America next autumn. 

Mr. W. I. Fletcher will conduct a school of library 
economy at Amherst this summer. The course will last 
six weeks beginning July 5. 

An " Old English Grammar and Exercise Book," by 
Dr. C. A. Smith, is published by Messrs. Allyn & Bacon. 
It is a book of the most elementary sort, designed for 
beginners only. 

" About Catherine de' Medici " is the latest volume of 
Balzac published in the Dent-Macmillan edition. Mrs. 
Bell is the translator, and Mr. Saintsbury writes the 
usual introduction. 

According to the " Vossische Zeitung " of Berlin, 
Ambassador Uhl, in his address upon the occasion of the 
Lowell birthday celebration, alluded to our poet as the 
successor of Longfellow and Thakeray at Howard Uni- 
versity. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. have just published 
volumes 3 and 4 of " The Life and Works of Robert 
Burns," edited by Robert Chambers and revised by Mr. 
William Wallace. The work is now complete in four 
volumes. 

Mr. Henry Altemns, of Philadelphia, is the publisher 
of Mrs. Florence M. Kingsley's new book entitled " Paul, 
a Herald of the Cross," which bids fair to enjoy as great 
a popularity as her two previous books, " Titus " and 
" Stephen." 

The Peter Paul Book Company, of Buffalo, will soon 
issue a volume of the collected poems of the Rev. Dom- 
inic Brennan, C.P., which have appeared in various pub- 
lications under the pen-names of " D. O'Kelly Branden" 
and " Harlow Howe." 

The American Library Association has planned an 
excursion to England this summer for the purpose of 
taking part in the international conference of librarians 
to be held in London July 13-16. The party will leave 
Boston June 26, and is due to return August 22. 

Continental papers announce that the unveiling of the 
statue which Yenosa (the ancient Yenusia) in Apulia 
has erected to the memory of Horace will take place 
next September, on which occasion a grand popular fes- 
tival will be held which is to extend over several days. 

A " Catalogue of the Library of the Browning Society 
of Boston " has reached us, and its nearly fifty pages of 
entries testify to the zeal of that organization in collect- 
ing books, pictures, and magazine articles bearing upon 
the life of the poet, or rather of the poets, since Mrs. 
Browning shares the attention of the Society equally 
with her husband. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. have completed 
arrangements witb Dean Farrar for the publication in 
the United States and Canada of his forthcoming book, 
entitled " Men I Have Known." The volume will be 
made up of Dean Farrar's reminiscences of Browning, 
Tennyson, Arnold, Stanley, Darwin, Tyndal, Lowell, 
Whittier, Holmes, and many other famous men of En-

gland and America. The work will be issued in hand- 
some form, and will contain several portraits and fac- 
simile letters. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. announce a new work by 
Mr. Edward Bellamy the first that he has published 
since " Looking Backward." This new book, to be en- 
titled " Equality," will present the same characters made 
familiar to us in the earlier work, and the time and 
scene of action will be the same. The volume will prob- 
ably appear in the latter part of April, and publication 
will be simultaneous in all the important countries of 
the world The same house has now added Mr. Hamlin 
Garland to its list of authors, and will soon issue a new 
volume of his stories with the title " Wayside Court- 
ships," besides new uniform editions of three of his best- 
known novels, " A Member of the Third House," " A 
Spoil of Office," and " Jason Edwards." 

Upon the day when this issue of THE DIAL appears, 
the John Crerar Library of Chicago is opened to the 
public. It occupies rented quarters in the Marshall 
Field business building, in the heart of the city, and 
expects to remain in them from five to ten years, when 
the accumulated income from the endowment will pro- 
vide a building without any impairment of the capital 
of two and a half millions. Natural, physical, and social 
science, with their applications, constitute the special 
field of this Library, and about fifteen thousand volumes 
are now ready for use. The number of periodicals 
already taken is eight hundred, and four hundred more 
will soon be added. By the end of 1898, it is expected 
that the shelves will contain forty thousand volumes. 
Mr. Clement W. Andrews, formerly of the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology, is the librarian, and is to 
be congratulated upon the work of organization and 
collection that he has accomplished. 

Baron Pierre de Coubertin contributes an interesting 
article on " L'Ame'rique Universitaire " to the March 
number of " Cosmopolis," but perhaps the most striking 
thing about it is the evidence it offers of the difficulty 
that foreign observers find in understanding the real 
spirit of American institutions. The following is a 
shining example of the sort of thing to which we allude: 
" Princeton, which has just celebrated its hundred and 
fiftieth anniversary, has freed itself of everything that, 
in the presbyterianism of its creators, would no longer 
prove compatible with the age and might have retarded 
the progress of a modern university. But the University 
of Chicago, born the other day, is impregnated with the 
Baptist spirit, the money which supports it is Baptist 
money, and no one expects to hear enunciated in its 
lecture-rooms the principles of that broad and pure 
Christianity of which Senator Leland Stanford gave the 
formula when he laid the corner stone of Palo Alto." 
The suggestion that Chicago is more orthodox than 
Princeton is amusing, no less than the notion that the 
late Senator Stanford first provided an American uni- 
versity refuge for " broad and pure Christianity." 

The dinner given to Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard by 
the Author's Club of New York, on the twenty-fifth of 
last month, was a noteworthy event, and brought together 
at the Hotel Savoy about as distinguished a body of 
men as are often assembled about a banquet table. 
Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman presided, and delivered 
the principal address of the evening. Many letters of 
regret were read, including European tributes from 
" Maarten Maartens," Mr. Austin Dobson, Dr. Conan 
Doyle, Dr. Richard Garnett, and Mr. Edmund Gosse. 
The latter wrote: "At the very moment at which you 



sit down to dinner, the Omar Khayyam Club in London 
(of which I am the president) will be doing the same, 
and one of our pleasant duties will be to drink the health 
of Richard Henry Stoddard over our Persian cups." 
Mr. Stoddard's part in the exercises of the evening con- 
sisted in the reading of " A Curtain Call," written for the 
occasion, from which we make the following extract: 
" A long, unbroken line is ours ; 

It has outlived whole lines of kings, 

Seen mighty empires rise and fall, 

And nations pass away like flowers 

Ruin and darkness cover all ! 

Nothing withstands the stress and strain, 

The endless ebb and flow of things, 

The rush of Time's resistless wings ! 

Nothing ? One thing, and not in vain, 

One thing remains : Letters remain ! 

Your art and mine, yours more than mine, 

Good fellows of the lettered line, 

To whom I owe this Curtain Call, 

I thank you all, I greet you all. 

Noblesse oblige ! But while I may, 

Another word, my last, may be : 

When this life-play of mine is ended, 

And the black curtain has descended, 

Think kindly as you can of me, 

And say, for you may truly say, 
' This dead player, living, loved his part, 

And made it noble as he could, 

Not for his own poor personal good, 

But for the glory of his art I ' "

President D. C. OILMAN, of Johns Hopkins University, says': 

"Thoroughness is its marked characteristic. . . . American scholar- 
ship may be proud of this achievement." 

JOHN FISKE says:

Ten Thousand Dollars 

IN PRIZES. 

One First Prize of $5,000. 
Five Other Prizes of $1,000 Each. 

The PLAIN CITIZEN PUBLISHING COMPANY offers the above 
Prizes for the most complete lists of scientific errors in The 
Argentaurum Papers No. 1. 

Prof. C. A. YOUNG, of Princeton University, has publicly stated that 
he regards the questions dealt with in the book as having long ago been 
settled so conclusively as to be now " beyond debate." 

Prof. S. NEWCOMB, of the U. S. Naval Observatory, has publicly de- 
clared the views advanced by the author of the book to be " vagaries." 
It is true that the Professor also asserts that he has never seen the book. 

Mr. R. A. PAKKE, of the Westinghouse A ir-Brake Company, in a paper 
read before the National Science Association of Staten Island, has de- 
nounced the book as being a " document " of which " every department 
abounds in errors and absurdities." But he has prudently declined a 
challenge to debate the matter before the Association. 

If these very eminent authorities be correct in their very positive 
pronouncements, it should not prove a difficult matter for any person of 
ordinary intelligence to prepare a list of the errors in the book, and thus 
win a prize of $5,000 or $1,000. 

In all fairness, however, the PLAIN CITIZEN PUBLISHING COM- 
PANY feels bound to express its opinion that the eminent critics of the 
book are eminently wrong, and that upon careful examination the book 
will be found unassailable. 

Applications will be made to the American and British Associations 
for the Advancement of Science to appoint judges of the competition. 
Inasmuch as it is of vital importance for the " advancement of science " 
that the questions raised in the book should be seriously considered, it 
is to be presumed that the two Associations will comply with the re- 
quest. If they should not do so, the competitors themselves will be 
entitled to name two judges, while the donors of the prizes will name 
two, and the four thus selected will appoint a fifth. 

The competition is open to Professor Newcomb, Professor Young, and 
Mr. R. A. Parke, and every person of every nation. 

Full particulars may be had upon application to the 

PLAIN CITIZEN PUBLISHING COMPANY,

The Devil =Tree of 
El Dorado. 

By FRANK AUBREY. Illustrations by Leigh Ellis 
and Fred Hyland. Thick 12 mo, cloth, stamped 
in fire bronze and gold, $1.50. 
" We have often wondered why the famous legend of El 
Dorado had never found its way into romance. Though the 
novel of adventure is once more in vogue, and although the 
cry is general that all possible themes have long ago been 
exhausted, this still was left untouched ; the story-tellers 
seemed to have thought the quest as hopeless as the adven- 
turers found it. The omission has now been made good ; the 
hidden city has been found." Macmillan's Magazine

" At the very first sentence the reader realizes that he is 
breathing a rarer air than usually emanates from the printed 
page. . . . Whatever the cause, the achievement is the sort 
that revives one's faith in that quality which, for want of a 
better word, we know as inspiration." New York Sun.

addition to the glimpse it affords of the Temple City, the

it offers the choice of three distinct routes through the moun- 
tains and the most magnificent scenery in the world. On all 
Pacific Coast tourist tickets stop-overs are granted at Denver,

Illustrated with 19 portraits and plates in photogravure and 21 maps and battle plans. 2 vols, 8vo,

The Life of Nelson forms a third book in the series of brilliant works upon " Sea Power," recognized 
everywhere as an authority. Nelson's correspondence and despatches and other sources of information 
have been carefully examined. Captain Mahan has made Nelson describe himself, tell the story of his 
own inner life as well as his external actions. While the first adequate life of the greatest sea-fighter the 
world has known, it is likely to take a high rank among Memoirs.

AMERICAN LANDS AND LETTERS 

FROM THE MAYFLOWER TO RIP VAN WINKLE. 

By DONALD G. MITCHELL. With Ninety Illustrations. 12mo, $2.50. (Fifth Thousand.) 
Mr. Mitchell's fascinating volume, which has gone at once into a second edition, covers the history of American litera- 
ture from " journalistic " Captain John Smith to William Cnllen Bryant. A critic says in the New York Tribune: " He 
has gone to the heart of his subject and to the hearts of his authors ; and old remote pedagogues and sermonizers whom the 
world has lost sight of completely, come back from their oblivion at Mr. Mitchell's bidding, and are alive once more. . . . 
It is truly a delightful book. It deals with an interesting theme, and deals with it in a manner that is only to be described 
as lovable the manner of Ik Marvel."

This volume, by the author of "A Wandering Scholar in 
the Levant," is written in the most modern spirit from orig- 
inal sources, and wholly transcends the traditional biogra- 
phies in convincing life-likeness. The portraits of Philip

impressive, and at times poetic, style of the book gives it a 
truly classic character.

*#* This translation is believed to be the only work accessible 
to English readers which gives a full and accurate account of 
the Aristotelian doctrine. In his treatise Dr. Zeller passes 
under review the known facts concerning Aristotle's life ; and 
general considerations regarding his particular works form 
an introduction to a more detailed examination. This is done 
under the headings: Logic, Metaphysics, Physics, Ethics, 
Politics, Rhetoric, and the Theory of Fine Art. A chapter is 
devoted to the religious aspect of A ristotle's teaching. Finally, 
an examination is made of the immediate successors of Aris- 
totle in the Peripatetic School from Theophrastns, Endemus, 
Aristoxenus, and others, to the Peripatetic School after Strato, 
till towards the end of the second century.

THE NEW OBEDIENCE. 

A Plea for Social Submission to Christ. By WILLIAM BAYARD 

HALE, Mission Priest of the Church of Our Savior, Middle- 

boro, Massachusetts. 12mo, gilt top, $1.25. 

The title, " The New Obedience," is employed to designate 

a movement in contrast to the New Learning, but carrying 

on and completing it, which the author contends must be 

undertaken by the age. The initial conception of the book is 

of the authority of Truth. Pointing out how vast results would 

flow from an enthusiasm of obedience to Truth, the author 

comes to his specific subject, which is an inquiry as to what 

would transpire were Christians to begin seriously to accept, 

and really to obey, the commands of the historical personage, 

Jesus of Nazareth.

*** This work is intended to fill the gap between Professor 
Max Mullet's " Science of Language " and " Science of Relig- 
ion." The work of his life, which he had planned and traced 
out long ago, is thus carried through and finished. His views 
on Mythology as an essential phase in the growth of the hu- 
man mind had not hitherto been brought together, but they 
may now be studied in the complete form in these two volumes.

By BEATRICE HAERADEN. 

HILDA STRAFFORD. 

A California Story. By the author of " Ships that Pass in the Night." With Illustrations by ERIC PAPE. 

12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

This is the first novel Miss Harraden has written since her memorable " Ships that Pass in the Night." It is 
a story of Californian life, and depicts the scenes in which Miss Harraden has for the last year or two been living. 
It is written with fine literary and artistic appreciation. Miss Harraden, during her sojourn in the West, has been 
much impressed by the homesickness of those who have sought to create a new home and fairer prospects out 
on the Californian ranches. The forlorn feeling that overtakes the exile; the quickened sense of remembered joys, 
intensified by the imagination amid the loneliness of the life ; the self-sacrificing toil of years out of materials 
like these Miss Harraden has constructed a tragic tale of vivid power and fresh interest.

" Little Huguenot," " An Impregnable City," etc.

THE GREAT " K. & A." TRAIN ROBBERY. 

By PAUL LEICESTER FORD, author of " The Honorable 
Peter Stirling," "The Story of an Untold Love." 
12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

A novel that is admirable reading, for it is sure to rouse the 
interest of the most listless reader and to keep him on tenter- 
hooks to the happy ending, when all the mystery and compli- 
cations are satisfactorily settled. The story is entitled "The 
Great K. & A. Train Robbery." It is, of course, a tale of 
the West, and the holding up of the K. & A. train has no 
parallel in all railroad history. It is told in first-class style, 
and the exciting incidents that follow the "hold-up" move 
almost as rapidly as an express train. It is bonnd to be widely 
and appreciatively read.

THE DOMINANT NOTE, 

And Other Stories. By Mrs. W. K. CLIFFORD, author 
of " The Love Letters of a Worldly Woman," " Aunt 
Anne," etc. 12mo, $1.25. 

" The qualities that go to make up the amusing short story 
have been here exhibited in an unusual degree. The power 
Mrs. Clifford showed in ' The Love Letters of a Worldly 
Woman ' to tell a story, and tell it well, has not been lost by 
her in these stories, but has rather been concentrated, making 
of each story an abbreviated novel and of each character a 
study ready for a more detailed and more minute characteri- 
zation." 



CHARITY CHANCE. 

By WALTER RAYMOND, author of " Love and Quiet 
Life," " In the Smoke of War." 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Mr. Raymond's work has at last received in England the 
recognition which it deserves, where " Gentleman Upeott's 
Daughter," " Sam and Sabina," "Love and Quiet Life," and 
"In the Smoke of War" have met with the most hearty 
appreciation. " Charity Chance " shows the same delicacy of 
spirit and fine penetrative insight which is characteristic of 
his genius. For it is nothing less than genius that is evinced 
in his work, and " Charity Chance " is sure to strengthen Mr. 
Raymond's reputation both here and in England. 



NEW STORIES AND TALES.

etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.25.

ably enhanced by his latest story, which positively bristles

THE DEC A Y OF AMERICAN 
JOURNALISM. 

There is something touching in the " Letter 
to Editors and Journalists " recently put forth 
by the " Baltimore Yearly Meeting of Friends." 
It is an appeal for the purification of the news- 
paper press, and the faith must indeed be 
abundant that imagines a few soft words suf- 
ficient to arouse in the breast of that hardened 
offender against decency the remorseful twinges 
of conscience. If the average American jour- 
nalist ever had such a thing as a conscience, it 
was killed long ago, and its place taken by a 
simulacrum of hypocritical accent and leering 
mien. This effective modern substitute for a 
conscience in journalism has discovered the se- 
cret of preaching virtue in such a manner that 
it nowise interferes with the practice of vice. 
It will, for example, devote one editorial col- 
umn to deploring the brutal tendencies of the 
age, and fill twenty columns of the same issue 
with a highly-colored account, from all possible 
points of view, of the latest event in the annals 
of the prize-ring. It will take high moral 
ground upon the evils of partisanship, and at 
the same time gloss over the corruption of the 
party in whose interests its own are wrapped 
up. It will profess to regret oh, so deeply 
that the dear public has developed so insatiate 
an appetite for scandalous sensations and vul- 
gar personalities, and will at the same time fur- 
nish a large staff of young men with muck-rakes 
of the most approved pattern, and direct them 
to gather in as many sensations and personali- 
ties as they can discover or invent, in order that 
the aforesaid dear public may not be deprived 
of its customary diet, and the sales of its fav- 
orite family newspaper show no symptoms of a 
decline. 

Revolutions in taste and in the standards of 
public decency are no more to be made with 
rose-water than are revolutions in sterner fields 
thus to be accomplished. Nothing short of the 
energetic measures of a Hercules will suffice to 
cleanse the Augean stables of the " new jour- 
nalism," and we can fancy something of the 
derision with which the rose-water phrases of 
the Baltimore friends will be received by the 
men who have been chiefly instrumental in 



238 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



making the American newspaper so great a 
national calamity. " We appeal to you, as Ed- 
itors," so runs the " Letter " from the good wo- 
men of the Baltimore Meeting, " for a reticence 
in the detail of crime and scandal, that the 
purely sensational shall be excluded, that pic- 
tures and advertisements, both personal and 
medical, which so insidiously lead the innocent 
and unsuspecting from the path of virtue, shall 
find no place in your columns. We especially 
ask your influence in raising the moral tone of 
the edition issued as the ' Sunday paper,' till it 
becomes a power for good among the people." 
This appeal is reiterated, with some variation 
of phrase, in a " Report " which accompanies 
the " Letter," and the pleasant hope is ex- 
pressed that in our journalism henceforth 
"fairer, lovelier paths be traced, leading to 
virtue and to hope." 

We fear that all the ears that such an appeal 
as this seeks to reach will be found deaf to its 
gentle pleadings. The foul sheets at which it 
aims will continue to do lip-service to whatso- 
ever things are good and pure, while disregard- 
ing in practice every consideration of decency. 
The effective arguments for purified journalism 
will be of a very different sort, and indications 
are not wanting that such arguments are about 
to be employed. The ringing words of the late 
Governor of Illinois, setting forth the impera- 
tive demand for legislation that will really pro- 
tect men from wanton assaults upon their char- 
acter by practically irresponsible editors, found 
an echo in many minds, and the bills recently 
introduced into the law-making bodies of Illinois 
and New York, making it an offence to publish 
portraits without the consent of the persons por- 
trayed, have taken a step in the right direction. 
Even the recent New York bill proposing a 
press-censorship, while unwise in principle, has 
made a good many people seriously ask them- 
selves whether an excessive measure of restric- 
tion might not be preferable to the excess of 
license which now characterizes the conduct of 
our newspapers. " Freedom of the press " has 
always been, and ought always to remain, a 
watchword of much meaning to any liberty- 
loving people, but its force may be greatly 
weakened by such abuses of that freedom as 
are daily illustrated by the newspapers of our 
chief cities. Still more significant than the 
attempts at legislation to which reference has 
been made is the recent action of a number of 
public libraries and clubs in Eastern cities, ex- 
cluding from their reading-rooms the two most 
conspicuously objectionable newspapers that 



are published anywhere in the country. Some- 
times a movement like this, once started, grows 
far more rapidly than might be anticipated, 
just as crystallization takes place in an over- 
saturated solution when some rallying-point is 
offered for the aggregation of the ready mole- 
cules. That some such crystallization of senti- 
ment on the subject of American journalism, its 
duties and its responsibilities, may soon take 
place is the deep desire of every thinking per- 
son who has the interests of this country at 
heart. 

Just as every people has, on the whole, the 
government that it deserves, so it must be ad- 
mitted that every city is responsible for the 
newspapers that it supports, and deserves noth- 
ing better until it is prepared actively to re- 
pudiate the sheets by which it is represented. 
It will not do merely to claim that it is mis- 
represented by them, deploring their dishonesty, 
their vulgarity of tone, and their pernicious 
sensationalism, while at the same time giving 
them the encouragement of subscriptions and 
advertising contracts. Nor are any protests 
likely to avail so long as the man who has ac- 
quired wealth in the pursuit of disreputable 
journalism is permitted to associate with gen- 
tlemen, to figure as a leading citizen at public 
gatherings, to enjoy the freedom of the club 
and the communion of the church. When the 
public conscience is sufficiently quickened to 
recognize the fact that such a man is a moral 
outcast, that his newspaper pollutes the home, 
that to purchase it upon the street-corner is a 
direct encouragement of its vicious practices, 
and that to use its columns for advertising pur- 
poses is to pay too great a price for commercial 
gain, when these things come to be recognized 
not as counsels of perfection but as working 
maxims for the conduct of daily life we may 
hope for a return to the more dignified and 
decent journalistic methods of the past genera- 
tion, and for the assimilation of our press to 
the ethical standards that are upheld as a matter 
of course in most other parts of the civilized 
world. 

If the time ever comes when those standards 
shall obtain in American journalism, our news- 
paper press will have found its real mission, 
and may become what it certainly is not now, 
a potent agency of enlightenment and a pillar 
for the support of republican institutions. Intel- 
ligent citizens everywhere would be only too 
glad to look to the newspaper for both light 
and leading ; at present, instead of shedding 
light, it darkens counsel by words without 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



239 



knowledge, and instead of leading opinion, it is 
prone to follow the uncertain guidance of every 
blind popular prejudice and every brutal fanati- 
cism that sways the masses of its readers. Its 
once considerable influence has so waned that 
its boasts of power excite only the derision of 
the well-informed ; its pretended statements of 
fact are so untrustworthy that few people place 
any confidence in them ; its opinions are not 
taken seriously because nobody supposes that 
they are reached by a process of serious rea- 
soning. If a newspaper of the typical sort 
perchance champion a good cause, few will be 
found to believe in the sincerity of its attitude, 
for its championship of bad causes has long 
since made it an object of suspicion, if not of 
contempt. 

The darkest hour is that which just precedes 
the dawn, and perhaps the dawn of a purified 
journalism is nearer at hand than we suppose. 
The legal maxim that wherever there is a 
grievance there is a remedy may prove valid in 
the wider ethical field wherein this foe must be 
grappled with. Whether the remedy come from 
within or without, whether it be an organic 
process of regeneration or a surgical operation 
does not matter so much ; what does matter is 
the undeniable fact that most of the newspapers 
published in our large cities are so devoid of 
principle that they constitute a perpetual men- 
ace to every genuine interest of our civilization. 
We need not single out those journals that 
stand as honorable exceptions to this general 
statement, nor those other journals that are 
kept from the state of grace by weakness rather 
than by will ; their editors and their friends 
will know that these remarks are not meant for 
them. But no words of condemnation can be 
too strong for the newspapers that subordinate 
all other aims to the aim of enlarging their 
circulation and their advertising patronage, 
that care nothing for the truth and only enough 
for decency to keep out of the clutches of the 
criminal law. There is no more important 
work to be done for our civilization to-day than 
that of shaming such newspapers either out of 
existence or into amended lives, and the respon- 
sibility for that work is shared by all alike. 



AFTER an existence of two years, " The Lark," of San 
Francisco, will cease publication with its April issue. 
This queer little periodical, founded and edited by Mr. 
Gelett Burgess and published by Mr. William Doxey, 
was quite the brightest and oddest of its kind, such suc- 
cess as it had being due chiefly to the nonsense verses 
and pictures contributed to its pages by Mr. Burgess. 



THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL 
MATERIAL IN THE MIDDLE WEST. 

Among the many phases of American history 
awaiting local investigation and record, few present 
so broad a field with such varying aspects, and thus 
far so little occupied, as the intermigration of the 
American people, the contributions of different race 
elements to various communities, and the evolution 
of existing government and society from them. In 
less than two and a half centuries, of which period 
over one century was consumed in crossing the Alle- 
gheny mountains, the people have traversed the 
three thousand miles of the continent, have swept 
three civilizations from their path, have carried with 
them always the image of the old home to be repro- 
duced in the new, have invented forms of transpor- 
tation and manufacture as necessity or opportunity 
offered, and have constantly evolved law and orderly 
self-government from the rude and jostling frag- 
ments of empire. Like " a deluge of men driven 
by the hand of God," wave after wave came on, in 
regular order ; the Indian-fighter, the trapper and 
hunter, the trader, the fugitive and half-breed, the 
claim-jumper and squatter, the poor shiftless farmer, 
the moderate home-maker, the prosperous agricul- 
turist, the small artisan, the exploiteur and capital- 
ist, the mill and factory army, and, last of all, the 
varied population of the great city, with its educated 
and professional classes, its wealth, and its prole- 
tariat. 

But however picturesque this shifting panorama 
may be, it begins to have national weight and na- 
tional interest only after its cycle is complete. Es- 
pecially is this true from the standpoint of the inves- 
tigating student. Sufficient time must elapse to 
allow the attendant circumstances to crystallize and 
the results to be manifest before investigation be- 
comes profitable. Hence the wave which bears the 
student must be the last, and, indeed, must await 
its own peculiar agencies. Although it is a worthy 
boast of the emigrant that he went " to plant the 
common schools on distant prairie swells," yet inten- 
sive education comes only with the library, the col- 
lege, and the university. For the Middle West, the 
cycle seems now complete. The colonization from 
the Eastern section is finished ; the uncouthness of 
the West exists almost solely in the belated wit of 
the newspaper paragrapher ; and the Universities of 
Chicago, of Wisconsin, of Kansas, are as much real- 
ities as those of Harvard and of Yale. But the work 
accomplished in the two regions cannot bear a com- 
parison. Nearly every phase of self-government, 
the different phenomena of industrial development, 
the relative values of various social organizations, 
the evolution of national feeling from local preju- 
dice, all these have been thoroughly examined and 
the results recorded in the region lying east of the 
Alleghenies. West of that line the field is largely 
untouched. The older universities have long lists 
of historical " studies " and " annals "; in the newer 
ones the work has scarcely begun. 



240 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



Obviously, the possibility of research work is in 
direct ratio to the material which has been preserved 
for it. The settlers in the older States, proud of 
their individuality, before the levelling " union " 
idea and larger means of transportation had done 
so much to efface sectional lines, possessing largely 
an agreement of tastes and motives, were more 
likely to preserve memorials and tokens of their 
daily lives than the more heterogeneous West, the 
product of all races and all ideas. Local pride was 
more easily aroused and material more easily pre- 
served where the birth of civilization was the result 
of a religious or aesthetic principle, rather than crude 
materialism ; where the nucleus of a village or city 
was a beautiful site or picturesque water-power, 
rather than a large industrial plant, the mouth of a 
mine, or that perfect type of uncouth materialism, a 
" boom " town. 

Yet to a certain extent the newer region will 
profit by the example of the older. The necessity 
of greater effort in the future for preserving this 
historical material will be more appreciated, its edu- 
cational value better understood, and more effort 
made by institutions of learning to collect and prop- 
erly care for it. For forty years the Wisconsin 
Historical Society has been engaged in such labor, 
with the result that Madison is now the Mecca for 
local investigators who can afford to travel. Yet 
the rarity of the case but proves how much more 
might be done if other agencies would bring similar 
influence to bear on their constituencies ; and it also 
calls attention to the necessity of employing every 
means, as that society has done, to bring people to 
a realization of the value of this material and so pre- 
vent its further destruction. People are commonly 
willing to place their possessions at the disposal of 
students ; but, naturally, they have no means of 
knowing respective values. A gentleman near the 
Mississippi carefully preserved a bound volume of 
some religious periodical of the last century (because 
of its date), and threw away a large and hence val- 
uable collection of anti-slavery pamphlets which he 
had accumulated during his connection with that 
movement. The popular idea of historical material 
clusters about the word "relic." Nearly all the 
libraries of the Ohio and the Mississippi valleys 
have museums of varying size and value ; but, em- 
bodying as they do articles nearest the affections 
and the curiosity of the people, their treasures con- 
sist largely of spinning-wheels, old furniture, Indian 
curiosities, and portraits of first settlers. Pamphlets 
and newspaper files are not so well known as are 
samplers and stone arrow-heads. Illustrations of 
the development of political and industrial life 
broadsides, posters, medals, badges, campaign song- 
books, ballots, banners, paper money, account books, 
photographs of historic events, public letters of 
prominent men, proclamations, such things as 
these are rarely considered of sufficient value to find 
a place in a museum. 

How to bring this matter to the attention of the 
general public, and thus insure the preservation of 



what has thus far escaped, is a practical problem 
that may well engage the attention of historical 
teachers and students in the Middle West. One 
often hears stories of the unconcerned destruction 
of manuscripts, pamphlets, and papers, of priceless 
value. The writer was once just too late to save a 
file of Richmond papers published during the trial 
of Aaron Burr. In another instance, a file of a 
Chicago daily from 1860 to 1880 was used grad- 
ually to kindle fires, and this in face of the fact 
that to-day there is not open to the student in the 
city of Chicago a complete file of a Chicago daily 
paper back of the destructive year of 1871. The 
librarian of the Public Library at Keokuk, Iowa, 
has collected and bound a number of valuable pam- 
phlets, largely Kansas-Nebraska and " abolition "; 
but the case is so unusual as to demand special notice. 
Although praiseworthy, the collection is pitifully 
meagre compared with similar ones to be found in 
almost any large library in the older States. There 
is pressing need of work to be done in collecting and 
preserving the material out of which students and 
historians are to describe the making of the West. 
If it be true that each generation creates afresh its 
heroes and idealizes a new territory, it would seem 
that the time has fully come when the political 
emancipation of the Mississippi region is sufficiently 
advanced to warrant its intelligent study in the light 
of the men who have accomplished its development. 
The renewed interest in Lincoln as a man and a 
statesman, and the reflected light on his not un- 
worthy foeman, Douglas, the present regard of Cass, 
of Benton, and of other leaders, foretell the coming 
political investigation as clearly as the new study of 
internal improvements, the consequent migration of 
people, and the origin and growth of towns and 
local government, foretells the future lines of indus- 
trial and social inquiry. Some systematic method 
must be devised by which the material for such 
studies shall be preserved. EDWIN E. SPARKS.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



TENNYSON'S USE OF ARCHAIC FORMS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Each of the communications published in your col- 
umns, in regard to Tennyson's use of "learn" for 
" teach," has, it seems to me, failed to consider Tenny- 
son's purpose. The first writer intimates that Tennyson's 
use of " learn " for " teach " in " Merlin and the Gleam " 
makes it doubtful whether or not it is right to say that 
" learn " in the sense of " teach " is a dialectal survival. 
The second writer alludes to Tennyson's admiration for 
the King James version of the Bible, and for the Book 
of Common Prayer of the Church of England, and sug- 
gests that Tennyson may not have recognized sufficient 
cause for the change of attitude toward the verb " learn." 
Professor Brown says that Tennyson's use of " learn " 
for " teach " simply illustrates his fondness for old 
forms; that he was not an absolute purist, and that the

THE DIAL 



241 



use of " learn " for " teach " is certainly an archaism. 
Tennyson had undoubtedly a fondness for old forms 
as a means of producing the effect which he desired. 
But imagine the surprise of the educated public if he 
had used " learn " for " teach " in conversation, or in 
" Locksley Hall," " Maud," or " In Memoriam "! The 
truth is that Tennyson had mastered the art of using the 
right word in the right place. If an archaism was needed 
to produce an archaic effect, he used it as naturally as 
he would have used a match to light a fire. That the 
archaic effect is a necessary element in the charm of 
" Merlin and the Gleam," no one who reads it carefully 
can doubt. Tennyson was a nineteenth-century poet 
writing for nineteenth-century readers, and therefore 
obliged to write in language intelligible in the nineteenth 
century. But the suggestion of Old English, without 
which there could be no really poetic treatment of 
Merlin and Magic, is given to the poem by its form, by 
the use of archaic words and phrases, " learned " for 
" taught," " landskip " for " landscape," " I can " in the 
sense of " I am able," and by the careful selection of 
pure Saxon words. Most of all, the poem owes its atmos- 
phere to the use of that one word " learned "; we read 
it, and we are at once in an older England. 

" Mighty the Wizard 
Who found me at sunrise 
Sleeping, and woke me 
And learn'd me Magic." 

Magic, in Merlin's meaning of the word, has never been 
"taught." The magic that is "taught" is that of the 
sleight-of-hand performer or of the " professor of clair- 
voyance." 

It seemed worth while to suggest that Tennyson's 
choice of the word "learned" is simply one of the 
numberless touches that indicate the great artist.

A QUESTION OF LITERARY ART. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Several years ago I was called upon to write a review 
of " Vagabond Tales," by the late Professor Boyesen. 
In that review I said : " It is difficult to decide whether 
the translation of the peasant dialect of Norway into a 
North-of-England dialect (as in 'Crooked John,' the 
first of the tales) be a fault in literary workmanship or 
a mark of genius. We incline to the latter opinion. 
It certainly aids the imagination to differentiate the sev- 
eral classes of persons brought to the reader's notice; 
and the correspondence between the Norse peasant dia- 
lect and that of the North-of-England is a natural one." 
The dialect introduced into the story referred to was 
in the words of the old " Granny." The following will 
serve as a specimen: 

" Shame on thee, lassie, shame ! If he dinna care for thee, 
dost tha think he would ha workit himself to death to give 
thee thy sight back again? . . . Dinna be so workit up about 
it, lassie ; wait till tha hast seen him." 

Now, the old granny could not have been represented as 
using the correct and refined language of the other char- 
acters in the story; and the words the author puts into 
her mouth have a picturesqueness that adds much to 
the effect of his delineation of her character. They 
seem so natural, furthermore, that they might easily 
have escaped the attention of the casual and uncritical 
reader. 

It happened somewhat later that Professor Boyesen 
was blamed by another reviewer for introducing New 



England provincialisms in a Norwegian story. But the 
questions have often been in my mind, could the au- 
thor have succeeded so well in differentiating his char- 
acters without the use of some such dialect? And what 
should this dialect be, one manufactured for the pur- 
pose, or one found ready-made and in use by a people 
corresponding in their ordinary characteristics with the 
Norse peasantry; something that brings with it the salt- 
air suggestion of the rocky coast of the North Sea? I 
am not sure which of these Professor Boyesen did. The 
question is of little practical value to American writers, 
who are not likely to attempt to compete with Professor 
Boyesen in the field where he won such distinguished 
success. But the question of literary art which is in- 
volved may not be devoid of interest; and if I am right 
in my view, this one of the " Vagabond Tales " will show 
Professor Boyesen to have been a greater master in this 
field than he is even now held to have been.

"JAPAN TIMES." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

This caption is the appellation of a new journalistic 
enterprise soon to be started in Tokyo. It will include 
both a daily and a weekly newspaper, and printing and 
lithographing of every description, in English. The chief 
proprietor of the paper is a Mr. Yamada, ex-director of 
a branch office of the Japan Mail Steamship Company, 
and a man, it is said, of considerable means. The chief 
editor is Mr. Zumoto, once translator for the " Japan 
Mail " and lately Secretary of Marquis Ito, when the 
latter was Premier. His assistant is Mr. Takenobu, for 
several years translator of the "Japan Mail." Both of 
these gentlemen write English excellently ; but they will 
also have a foreigner, Mr. Cowen, as supervisory editor, 
and several foreign contributors. The daily is to be 
issued from March 15; and it is advertised to give the 
" latest and most reliable news on all matters of interest 
at home and abroad; special attention given to the po- 
litical, social, industrial, and economic development of 
Japan." It also promises to issue illustrated supple- 
ments and original notes dealing with the national insti- 
tutions, old and new, manners and customs, traditions, 
etc." It claims to be " assured of a large circulation 
among the Japanese public," and will be widely dis- 
tributed " all over the world." It promises to be " per- 
fectly independent." All this is to be supplied for 10 
yen (just about $5 U. S. gold) per year, whether in 
daily or in weekly issues in Japan. 

I make mention of this enterprise for two reasons: 
first, because it is another evidence of the increasing 
popularity of the English language in Japan; and again 
because it is a Japanese, and not a foreign, enterprise. 
It is true that foreigners are to be connected with it, 
but the responsibility in all ways rests upon Japanese. 
It remains to be seen, of course, whether it will have 
only a temporary, or a permanent, career; whether or 
not it can gain sufficient support, from Japanese prin- 
cipally, to continue its existence; and whether it can 
even compete with and, perhaps, drive out the English 
papers, published and edited by foreigners. Some of 
these can well be spared; and they may be supplanted 
by this new-comer in the journalistic field. At any rate, 
the inception of the " Japan Times " is, in many ways, 
a good illustration of the present trend of affairs in 
Young Japan. ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

NELSON AS A FORCE IN HISTORY.* 

The Life of Nelson has been written often and 
sympathetically, and the theme is preeminently 
one to engage and inspire the British pen. It 
has remained, however, for an American author, 
Captain A. T. Mahan, to do full and final jus- 
tice to the hero of Trafalgar. Rivals in point 
of style, in glow and vivacity of narration, 
Captain Mahan perhaps has among Nelson's 
many biographers ; but in breadth and calm- 
ness of view, and in historical grasp and insight, 
the accomplished author of " The Influence of 
Sea Power upon History " easily surpasses the 
best of his predecessors. Readers may still con- 
ceivably elect to consult the lives by Southey 
and Laughton, or even Barker's, for the more 
graphic and familiar qualities of portraiture ; 
but henceforth the student who desires prima- 
rily to understand the great Admiral's signifi- 
cance as an historical factor will turn as a 
matter of course to Captain Mahan's thought- 
ful and comprehensive pages. We do not mean 
to imply that Captain Mahan's predilection for 
history and disquisition has led him to neglect 
the biographer's first duty of painting the por- 
trait of his hero. This duty he has performed 
in his own painstaking and methodical way, 
basing his conception largely on careful study 
and analysis of Nelson's copious correspond- 
ence ; and the finished result probably gains in 
accuracy what it naturally loses in brilliancy 
and verve. 

History has been defined as " the essence of 
innumerable biographies." Captain Mahan, 
fresh from the considerations embodied in his 
magnum opus on Sea Power, and writing biog- 
raphy largely from the historian's point of 
view, has given us a Life of Nelson consisting 
in an unusual measure of that " essence " which 
goes to the making of history. He has painted 
his hero as a man ; he has also defined him as 
a historical and political force. His book may 
be regarded as in a sense supplementary to his 
masterly discussion of the Influence of Sea 
Power. It is essential, he thinks, to the com- 
pleteness of that discussion that a study be 
presented, from the point of view therein taken, 
of the man who in himself summed up and em-

bodied the greatness of the possibilities which 
Sea Power comprehends, " the man for whom 
genius and opportunity worked together, to 
make him the personification of the Navy of 
Great Britain, the dominant factor in the pe- 
riods hitherto treated." 

Nelson's page in history is as brief as it is 
brilliant, covering a little more than twelve 
years, from February, 1793, to October, 1805. 
Its opening coincides with the Reign of Terror 
with those dark days of disillusionment for 
liberal Europe, when men saw springing from 
the bosom of that democracy whose advent had 
been hailed as the dawn of a new and splendid 
era for the race an iron despotism with claims 
more sweeping and methods more drastic than 
those of the Grand Monarch himself. Louis 
XIV. in the plenitude of his power would have 
shrunk from measures which with men like 
Saint Just, Billaud, Robespierre, and Hebert 
were commonplaces of government. The sceptre 
of his successors was an unfelt bauble compared 
with the leaden mace with which the great Com- 
mittee crushed out all semblance of opposition 
to its decrees. Anarchy quelled and criticism 
stifled at home, the Revolution was at last free 
to indulge its innate propagandist tendencies 
abroad ; for the gospel of Jean- Jacques was 
essentially a message, not to Frenchmen alone, 
but to Man, " born free " yet " everywhere in 
chains." Abroad, as in France, the preliminary 
work of the apostles of the new light was work 
of destruction. Bastilles must be razed and 
tyrants dethroned in order that the enslaved 
peoples might profit, as Frenchmen had prof- 
ited, by the glad tidings of the century. It is 
not always clearly understood that France, not 
feudal and reactionary Europe, was primarily 
the aggressor in the wars of the Revolution. 
She would have made war or provoked it had 
there been no Declaration of Pilnitz, no Bruns- 
wick's Manifesto. The motives of the states- 
men who preponderated in her councils at the 
outset of hostilities, while not unalloyed by 
considerations of party expediency, were in the 
main generous, if chimerical. But the crusade 
of liberty preached by the eloquent Girondists 
and decried by the Jacobins was destined in 
time to degenerate into a war of conquest waged 
by the ruthless ambition of Bonaparte. And 
from first to last, from Longwy to Waterloo, 
France was really the aggressor. For twenty- 
three years she shook and menaced the estab- 
lished order of Europe. To beat back this 
spirit of aggression, founded in humanitarian 
dreams and ending in militarism and rapacity,

was the mission of Nelson. He was singularly 
fitted for the task. English to the core, insular, 
knowing no political ideal save King and Coun- 
try, no rule save that of duty, a seaman beyond 
compare, endowed with a splendid and match- 
less personal bravery that in the moment of 
action seemed to shine and radiate from his 
fragile frame and light a kindred spark in 
hearts commonly the least heroic, his name 
became the potent counter-charm that broke 
the spell laid by the conquering genius of Bo- 
naparte upon the soul of Europe. The cardinal 
article in his professed creed was characteristic, 
if unedifying : " You must hate a Frenchman as 
you do the devil." Not all the glories of Copen- 
hagen, the Nile, and Trafalgar should blind us 
to the relative moral narrowness of the holder 
of that maxim when we compare him with such 
figures as Turgot and Condorcet. But French- 
men of the Turgot and Condorcet type had 
long been displaced in men's imaginations by 
the Marats and Robespierres. Chaumette fol- 
lowed Voltaire as John of Leyden followed 
Luther ; and the Reformation of the Eighteenth 
Century was discredited, as that of the Six- 
teenth had been, by the violence of sectaries. 
Nelson's creed of hatred was intelligible enough 
to men of his day ; for there was latterly more 
of diabolism than godliness in the methods of 
the practical disciples of the philosophes. Re- 
garding Nelson's mission as Europe's defender 
against French aggression, Captain Mahan 



" Therein is found the true significance of his career, 
which mounts higher and higher in strenuous effort and 
gigantic achievement, as the blast of the Revolution 
swells fiercer and stronger under the mighty impulse of 
the great Corsican. At each of the momentous crises, 
so far removed in time and place, at the Nile, at Copen- 
hagen, at Trafalgar, as the unfolding drama of the 
age reveals to the onlooker the schemes of the arch- 
planner about to touch success, over against Napoleon 
rises ever Nelson; and as the latter in the hour of victory 
drops upon the stage where he played so chief a part, 
his task is seen to be accomplished, his triumph secured. 
In the very act of dying he has dealt the foe a blow 
from which recovery is impossible. Moscow and Water- 
loo are the inevitable consequences of Trafalgar; as the 
glories of that day were but the fit and assured ending 
of the illustrious course which was begun upon the 
quarter-deck of the ' Agamemnon.' " 

While the dominant note of Captain Mahan's 
book is one of unstinted, generous admiration, 
he does not shrink from the evidently painful 
duty of rehearsing impartially the story of his 
hero's lapses and imperfections. The Lady 
Hamilton scandal is a commonplace of histor- 
ical gossip, farcical and deplorable ; and Cap- 
tain Mahan does not try to gloss it. That un- 



happy episode lent a touch of bathos to the 
great sailor's career even to its heroic ending 
in the blood-spattered cock-pit of the " Vic- 
tory." What reader of Nelson's life has not 
winced at the picture of the susceptible hero 
dragged like a dancing-bear about Europe by 
his (and Greville's and a half-dozen others') 
fat inamorata? Captain Mahan ventures to 
compare Lady Hamilton with Lady Nelson, 
not altogether to the advantage of the latter. 

" Not that the Lady Hamilton of reality was utterly 
different from the Lady Hamilton of his (Nelson's) im- 
agination. That she ever loved him is doubtful; but 
there were in her spirit impulses capable of sympathetic 
response to his own in his bravest acts, though not in 
his noblest motives. It is inconceivable that duty ever 
appealed to her as it did to him, nor could a woman of 
innate nobility of character have dragged a man of Nel- 
son's masculine renown about England and the Conti- 
nent, till he was the mock of all beholders; but on the 
other hand it never could have occurred to the energetic, 
courageous, brilliant Lady Hamilton, after the lofty 
deeds and stirring dramatic scenes of St. Vincent, to beg 
him, as Lady Nelson did, ' to leave boarding to Cap- 
tains.' Sympathy, not good taste, would have withheld 
her. In Lady Nelson's letters there is evidence enough 
of a somewhat colorless womanly affection, but not a 
thrill of response to the greatness of her husband's dar- 
ing, even when surrounded herself by the acclamations 
it called forth." 

Whether or no Lady Hamilton really loved 
Nelson seems a point hardly worth refining on. 
It is a plain case to a plain understanding. To 
Nelson the man, stripped of the glamor of his 
fame, she was doubtless indifferent. As a lover 
she would have preferred Greville (who had 
discarded her and passed her on to his friend 
Hamilton without a " by your leave ") a hun- 
dred times over. But the victor of the Nile, 
the rival of Napoleon ? Nelson was the lion of 
the hour when Lady Hamilton spread her net 
for him. His name was in all mouths, the din 
of his renown in all ears. To captivate such a 
man, to couple her name with his in current 
rumor, and thus to secure a position that would 
enable her to dazzle and outshine with a bril- 
liant if borrowed light, was the natural im- 
pulse of a born and trained adventuress whose 
ruling passion was an insensate greed of social 
distinction, however won. Of the equivocal 
character of the distinction accruing from the 
possession of Lord Nelson as her devoted cicis- 
beo the ci-devant Amy Lyon naturally had no 
inkling. Her long contact with Neapolitan and 
Palerman manners had blunted sensibilities 
originally coarse enough. Nelson, as we know, 
yielded without a struggle to his " angel Em- 
ma's " sufficiently impetuous onset. The victor 
of the Nile ignominiously struck his colors at

willing prize, to the mortification of his friends. 
How the amazing joint establishment latterly 
set up at Merton appeared in " proper " En- 
glish eyes is amusingly manifest in a letter of 
Lord Minto's (1802). 

" I went to Lord Nelson's (Merton) on Saturday to 
dinner, and returned to-day in the forenoon. The whole 
establishment and way of life is such as to make me 
angry as well as melancholy ; but I cannot alter it, and 
I do not think myself obliged or at liberty to quarrel 
with him for his weakness, though nothing shall ever 
induce me to give the smallest countenance to Lady 
Hamilton. She looks ultimately to the chance of mar- 
riage, as Sir William will not be long in her way, and 
she probably indulges a hope that she may survive Lady 
Nelson ; in the meanwhile she and Sir William and the 
whole set of them are living with him at his expense.* 
She is in high looks, but more immense than ever. She 
goes on cramming Nelson with trowelfuls of flattery, 
which he goes on taking as quietly as a child does pap. 
The love she makes to him is not only ridiculous but 
disgusting. Not only the rooms, but the whole house, 
staircase and all, are covered with nothing but pictures 
of her and him, of all sizes and sorts, and representa- 
tions of his naval actions, coats of arms, pieces of plate 
in his honor, the flagstaff of L'Orient, etc. an excess 
of vanity which counteracts its own purpose. If it was 
Lady Hamilton's house there might be a pretence for 
it; but to make his own a mere looking-glass to view 
himself all day is bad taste." 

Captain Mahan's book is easily one of the 
notable ones of the year a finished and schol- 
arly production that must tend, like its prede- 
cessors, to add materially to the solid repute of 
American authorship abroad. It is sure of a 
warm reception in England especially, where 
the need of such a really adequate, judicial, and 
comprehensive life of the favorite national 
hero has been long felt ; and it deserves to be 
widely read in America. Captain Mahan has 
unquestionably taken his place with the little 
group of American historians whose books are 
standard throughout the English - speaking 
world ; and his success is a matter of national 
gratification. The volumes are handsomely and 
suitably made up, and contain a good Index, a 
very full and serviceable table of contents, to- 
gether with an abundance of maps and plans 
illustrative of the author's admirable descrip- 
tions of Nelson's sea-fights. The nineteen por- 
traits and plates in photogravure are well chosen 
and well made. 

Professor John Knox Laughton, who is the 
author of an excellent short Life of Nelson, 
now produces a handsome memorial volume en- 
titled " Nelson and his Companions in Arms."

incidents of Nelson's career, and points out the 
chief influences which contributed to the forma- 
tion of his character. As the title implies, 
considerable space is devoted to Nelson's lead- 
ing professional associates, whose portraits and 
signatures in facsimile form an interesting fea- 
ture of the volume. The work is not a mere 
panegyric. The author has, as he says, por- 
trayed his hero " as a man, with a man's pas- 
sions and a man's weaknesses, but as a man of 
transcendent genius, endowed with that grand- 
est attribute of genius, the capacity of taking 
infinite pains." As a Nelson Memorial, the 
work is well equipped. There are a liberal 
number of plates, comprising portraits, battle 
scenes, photographic views of Nelson monu- 
ments and trophies, views of Nelson's flagships, 
etc. There is a striking frontispiece in colors, 
representing the stern of the " Victory " sur- 
rounded by the flags which indicated to the 
British sailors at Trafalgar the famous signal : 
" England expects that every man will do his 
duty." The Appendix contains a list of Nelson's 
titles and orders, a Nelson Chronology, and a 
Nelson Bibliography. Professor Laughton is 
Lecturer on Naval History at the Greenwich 
Naval College ; and his book is presumably 
authoritative so far as it goes. E. G. J. 



THE CLASSICS OF CRITICISM.* 

At the present day it is, in the world of let- 
ters, much as it was in Israel after Samson : 
every man does what is right in his own eyes. 
Not only poets, but critics as well, are, if they 
desire to be, frankly subjective. Criticism tends 
to become a form of the lyric. If a man feel 
himself a prophet, his criticism becomes apo- 
calyptic ; if he have a taste attuned to all 
beauty, his work becomes a sympathetic and 
often adulatory appreciation ; if he be worthy 
the privilege of being an American, he sees to 
it that his criticism is democratic. Criticism 
to-day is as changeable as Proteus. 

It was not always so. During the last cen- 
tury, criticism was not apocalyptic, democratic, 
appreciative : it was usually procrustean. There 
were certain RULES. These " rules," by which 
our forefathers judged, were fondly conceived 
to be set down in certain treatises on the Art 
of Poetry. Of these the chief were those of

Aristotle, Horace, Vida, and Boileau ; but we 
may well add to them the " Essay on Criticism " 
of Pope. All five have fallen from their un- 
questioned station ; the critics of our day do 
not much trouble their heads or their readers 
with them. In this is both a gain and a loss. 
No one of the five is an adequate treatise on 
Poetry or the Art of Poetry ; but, on the other 
hand, each has a great deal that is of lasting 
value. Aristotle's " Poetics " has lately been 
made accessible to all in Professor Butcher's 
edition. Professor Cooke's " The Art of Poe- 
try " gave us very conveniently Horace and 
Boileau in the original and in translation, and 
has the advantage of including also poor old 
" immortal Vida," who might otherwise be for- 
gotten. And now we have an English para- 
phrase of Horace, " De Arte Poetica," by Mrs. 
A. O. Russell, and an edition of the " Essay on 
Criticism," by Mr. J. Churton Collins. 

There have been not a few translations of 
the " De Arte Poetica," and Byron's " Hints 
from Horace " may be called a paraphrase, 
although the noble author himself called it " an 
allusion." Mrs. Russell's paraphrase, however, 
is of a different sort ; it is a free prose transla- 
tion combined with a running explanation. 
The ideas of the original are set forth in a 
simpler, more extended form. So far as con- 
cerns the information to be had of the original, 
one has it here in a form that will be much 
more comprehensible to the general reader than 
most translations would be. In general one 
gets a good understanding of the substance of 
the poem, although in some cases (e. g., 11. 108- 
111, 128), Mrs. Russell has not given precisely 
the correct idea. To the paraphrase is added a 
useful collection of epigrammatic passages which 
have become familiar.* Mr. Churton Collins's 
volume is more conventional in its form an 
annotated text with introduction and more 
scholarly in its accomplishment. It is thor- 
oughly good, and will be useful far beyond the 
field for which it is designed. 

Mrs. Russell is content with Horace. Her 
plan included no more than is indicated in her 
title. We think the work demands a wider 

* In this part of the book are a number of errors which, for 
the benefit of possible users, it is worth while to correct. The 
references to Nos. 7 and 15 are incorrect ; they should be 1. 365 
and 1. 441 respectively. In Nos. 34 and 45 the references are 
omitted ; they should be 1. 476 and 1. 170. Nos. 32 and 25 
need the words which in the poem precede them. In Nos. 4 
and 30 the order of the words is incorrect. There are some 
errors or misprints ; nodi's in No. 13, -quae in No. 77. So also in 
the text; Porttus (p. 12), Ino (p. 21), Tyrteaus (p. 53), Mes- 
sela (p. 50). Zeus (p. 46), does not accord well with Juno in 
the next line : but perhaps this is only a touch of nature ; the 
two were proverbially ill-matched. 



view. Something certainly is gained by under- 
standing the ideas of Horace only, but not very 
much. Taken by themselves, without comment 
or comparison, they have been forced into a 
place for which they were never meant. Horace 
wrote his Epistle for a young Roman who had 
it in mind to write a play. The older man 
gave advice on the special topic : what more he 
added is of the nature of obiter dicta. It is a 
mistake to think that Horace sets down "rules "; 
in so far as the drama of his time is concerned, 
he does give the conventions that had long ob- 
tained ; but otherwise he gives merely the 
friendly advice in writing that any older crafts- 
man might offer a junior. It was by an irony 
that he would himself hardly have appreciated 
that his epistle became a treatise. We must 
read Horace as Mr. Churton Collins enables us 
to read Pope, with an eye always to the others. 
Of all these five, Horace has really packed 
the most sense into his work. Aristotle was a 
wiser man, but not so much of a man of letters. 
Pope and Boileau were more cramped by tra- 
dition than Horace : note, for instance, what 
Horace has to say on diction, on borrowing or 
coining words, 11. 46-72. We have not got to 
a more sensible position to-day. Our books on 
rhetoric have harsh names for those who use a 
French word now and then, or make up some 
fresh form to suit themselves. The caution is 
doubtless good, but in itself it is not consistent 
with the usage of the language which has always 
grown by just the processes which are now rep- 
rehended. So it was with Horace : 

" Quid autem 

Caecilio Plantoque dabit Romanus ademptnm 
Vergilio Varioque ? " 

Or with Byron, who is generally amusing in his 
" Hints from Horace ": 

" What Chaucer, Spencer did, we scarce refuse 
To Dryden's or to Pope's matnrer muse. 
If you can add a little, say why not 
As well as William Pitt or Walter Scott ? " 

Horace, in his position here, shows really more 
unconventional sense, more true knowledge of 
the authority of words, and so, in a way, of 
poetry, than can be found in Boileau or Pope, 
who never conceived such an idea at all. 

Or, to take another matter, one on which the 
moderns also have had their say, the remark of 
Horace on the problem of style : " Difficile est 
proprie communia dicere."* " It is hard to 

*Mrs. Kussell translates (p. 63), "To express commonplace 
things with propriety." One can hardly imagine Horace's 
making such a futile statement. It is not, and never was, 
difficult to express commonplace things with propriety ; on the 
other hand, it is, unfortunately, just the thing that everybody 
can do with ease. The translation on p. 22 does not miss the 
point so widely, although proprie does not mean ' ' acceptably."

speak of things that everybody may speak of 
in such a way as to make them your own." It 
seems almost necessary to take the passage as 
referring not merely to the working on material 
already known (as Shakespeare's plots, for 
instance), but with at least a thought of the 
broader application to all artistic work. Pope, 
when he says : 

" True wit is nature to advantage dressed ; 
What oft was thought, though ne'er so well expressed," 

does not say so much, because he does not really 
hit on the point of style. There is much of the 
difference between the eighteenth and the nine- 
teenth centuries in the difference between " to 
advantage" and our rendering of proprie, 
the difference between classic and romantic 
style. Mr. Churton Collins, in his note on the 
passage, quotes Dryden's definition, " a pro- 
priety of thought and words "; but by Dryden's 
time " propriety " meant what it means to-day 
Pope's lines seem to be practically based on a' 
passage in Boileau ; but the French critic, if 
we may believe M. Brunetiere, was keener than 
the English poet. " Ou encore," says M. Brun- 
etiere, " la pensee que tout le monde pourrait 
avoir, ou doit me me avoir cue comme nous, il 
y a une maniere de 1'exprimer ' fine, vive et nou- 
velle ' qui ne doit appartenir qu'a nous ; et 
c'est precisement a force d'art que nous la trou- 
vons ; et c'est en quoi consiste pour Boileau la 
veritable originalite"." I confess that I cannot 
see in the passage as much as does M. Brune- 
tiere, but anyone can see how admirably the 
comment expresses the romantic spirit, although 
perhaps not in its most modern form. If Boi- 
leau had the Horatian thought, he kept his view 
from Pope ; and so Pope impaired the vitality 
of English poetry for fifty years by his futile 
" to advantage dressed," and succeeded in teach- 
ing " a school of dolts to smooth, inlay, and 
clip, and fit," as the excited Keats has it. 

Horace is very modern, we say ; we can read 
him nowadays with great comfort, with greater 
comfort than we can get from Pope. Not only 
is Horace nearer to us in his ideas on language 
and on style ; he understood criticism better 
than did Pope. Not as proof, but as illustra- 
tion, take the question as to the qualification of 
the critic himself, in the art which he criticizes. 
Horace, although really an old poet advising a 
young one, says : 

" Munns et officium, nil scribens ipse docebo." 

Lord Byron paraphrases : 

" Nor write at all, unless to teach the art 
To those rehearsing for the poet's part." 

Pope, however, has the somewhat ambiguous 
couplet : 



" Let such teach others who themselves excel, 
And censure freely who have written well." 

But the quotation from Pliny seems to fix his 
meaning.* Mr. Churton Collins has a good 
note on the passage, unfamiliar to us, from 
" Serjeant Maynard, who was fond of saying, 
1 Felices essent artes, si nulli de eis judicarent 
nisi artifices.' " There is, however, the possi- 
bility of even an artist being prejudiced ; and 
if this be the case, he is generally much worse 
than any mere critic. 

It would be delightful to go further in com- 
parison ; we are glad to have the two books 
now in hand for suggestion. But they leave 
still an opportunity for anyone who knows the 
development of critical ideas in the last two 
hundred years to give us in a synoptic view the 
ideas of Aristotle, Horace, Vida, Boileau, Pope, 
with a good commentary. The classic tradition 
almost vanished in the flood of new critical 
thought which is marked for us by the names 
of Lessing, Goethe, Diderot, Coleridge. But 
the right hand could point out to us many 
places in which the old ideas have come to the 
surface again.

ONE OF THE FATHERS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION.* 

It is in itself a title to distinction to a public 
man to have had so shrewd a judge of men as 
Thomas Jefferson, a political opponent, say of 
him : " That is Mr. Sherman of Connecticut, a 
man who never said a foolish thing in his life." 
Another and greater title is it to have formu- 
lated and proposed the compromise principle of 
double representation that made our Constitu- 
tion possible in the struggle between large and 
small States. Therefore Mr. Lewis Henry 
Boutell, a grandson of Roger Sherman, has 
done well in bringing before this generation 
the well-nigh forgotten name of this one of the 
" Fathers " who in his character and work is 
typical of the best men of a century ago. He 
has given a plain straightforward account, with- 
out the padding that so often swells the biog- 
raphy of a minor character beyond all compar- 
ison with his ability and influence. The reader 
is supposed to be familiar with the history of 
the times, and only Mr. Sherman's part is de- 
scribed. The account is adequate, yet the de-

mand on the reader's time and attention is not 
excessive. 

Roger Sherman was entirely a self-taught 
man. He sat on the shoemaker's bench till he 
was twenty-two years old. But he had great 
thirst for knowledge, and, like many another 
exemplar of our boyhood, kept his book open 
before him as he worked, and gained a consid- 
erable fund of general knowledge in this way. 
Going west to western Connecticut in 1743, 
in two years he was a surveyor, and before he 
was thirty he was the owner of several hundred 
acres of land and a dwelling worth two thou- 
sand pounds. This great business ability was 
freely devoted to the service of the community 
and the church. After the age of thirty he 
was led to take up the study of law, which he 
practiced only a few years, when he moved to 
New Haven and engaged in mercantile pur- 
suits. After ten years of this, at the age of 
fifty, he turned over his business to his sons, 
and devoted the remaining twenty years of his 
life entirely to the public service. Yale College, 
the city, the state, and the nation, all put their 
burdens on his strong shoulders, and he never 
once shrank from the load. 

It is astonishing to see how little the unde- 
veloped democracy of that day realized its priv- 
ileges. So far were they from making the 
offices go as far as possible in satisfying hun- 
gry patriots by rapid rotation and the widest 
distribution, that they did not seem even to be 
hungry, and offices were actually heaped upon 
a few and kept there indefinitely. Mr. Sher- 
man's less than forty years of public life, if 
measured by years of office, would number more 
than seventy. It was not because he possessed 
abilities of that commanding quality that we 
call genius, that he was called to this long and 
varied service. He had indeed great business 
ability good sense to so high a degree that it 
might almost be called genius, an almost infal- 
lible judgment as to the practicable and expe- 
dient in any circumstances. He was a man of 
action rather than a man of thought. This he 
showed in his notable service in the Constitu- 
tional Convention of 1787. When the philoso- 
phers, intent upon the adoption of their theories 
and systems, had brought matters to a dead- 
lock, it was the practical men who arranged the 
compromises, found a working basis of agree- 
ment, and thus made possible a Constitution 
that fully pleased nobody, but has proved its 
excellence and their ability through a century's 



strenuous tests. His part in the framing of the 
Constitution was not like that of Madison and 
Wilson, but rather like that of Franklin. Mr. 
Boutell bases his grandfather's claim to a high 
place among the founders of the nation largely 
upon his proposal of the Connecticut Com- 
promise. 

" To Roger Sherman belongs the credit, not only of 
introducing in the convention this compromise, which, 
as we hare seen, was in substance the plan proposed by 
him eleven years before, but also of bearing the brunt 
of the contest in its favor, through a long and severe 
struggle, till it was finally adopted." 

A younger contemporary, Theodore Sedgwick, 
said : 

" Roger Sherman was the man of the selectest wisdom 
that I ever knew. No law or part of law that Mr. 
Sherman favored failed to be enacted." 

Happy were the days when wisdom ruled among 
lawmakers ! 

Jeremiah Mason, who was often, when a law 
student, at Mr. Sherman's house, gives this 
picture of the great man : 

" His manners, without apparent arrogance, were 
excessively reserved and aristocratic. His habit was, 
in his own house, when tea was served to company, to 
walk down from his study into the room, take a seat 
and sip his tea, of which he seemed very fond, and then 
rise and walk out without speaking a word or taking 
any manner of notice of any individual. In the street 
he saw nobody, but wore his broad beaver pointing 
steadily to the horizon, and giving no idle nods." 

He was often called aristocratic for his peculiar 
manners, but if one might apply common stand- 
ards to a Revolutionary statesman, certain facts 
seem to indicate that he was not above posing 
as a sage. 

Mr. Sherman was not an orator. He had but 
few words, going directly to the heart of the 
question. In New Haven they said that when 
he was interested in speaking his gesture was 
like that of a shoemaker drawing a thread. His 
ardent admirer, John Adams, said : 

"Sherman's air is the reverse of grace; there cannot 
be a more striking contrast to beautiful action than the 
motion of his hands. Hogarth's genius could not have 
invented a motion more opposite to grace; it is stiffness 
and awkwardness itself, rigid as starched linen or buck- 
ram; awkward as a junior bachelor or a sophomore." 

Yet Patrick Henry once said that the first men 
in the Continental Congress were Washington, 
Richard Henry Lee, and Roger Sherman ; and, 
later in life, that Roger Sherman and George 
Mason were the greatest men he ever knew. 
History hardly bears out this latter judgment, 
but he must have been a strong man who could 
call it forth. CHARLES H. COOPER.

THE MODERN "ETHICAL, MOVEMENT."* 



Mr. W. L. Sheldon's book upon the modern 
" Ethical Movement " will find many readers, 
and will be helpful to those who occupy relig- 
ious positions far removed from his own. He 
gives a frank, clear, and earnest description of 
the general ideas and methods of the movement 
which roots in the Society for Ethical Culture 
founded by Dr. Felix Adler in New York City 
about a score of years ago. But he does more than 
this : he illustrates how the spirit of this move- 
ment deals with many practical and important 
problems. The Ethical Movement represents, 
on the one hand, a wholesome reaction against 
dogmas remote from human concerns and rites 
that develope little more than a vague sense of 
mystery. On the other hand, it is a positive 
expression of those humane feelings which have 
so widely and powerfully expanded in recent 
years, feelings that reach out manward in 
pity over the sorrows of mankind, and in prompt 
service for the progress and enrichment of hu- 
manity. Its leaders feel profoundly that sci- 
entific truth must be put to use under the au- 
thority of the Moral Ideal. The enthusiasts 
for the higher life of man mourn the spiritual 
waste and lack of social fruitf ulness within the 
churches, while they see that scientific discov- 
ery alone can never be an adequate guide 
through the perplexities of life. They hold 
that we can never get along without religion, 
but religion must be enlarged on the side of 
moral sentiment. They hold, also, that we can 
never do without science, but the truth that it 
reveals must be put to use by ethical passion. 

All this is brought out clearly and forcibly 
by Mr. Sheldon in these thoughtful pages. 
The average religious reader will probably be 
surprised to find so much here with which he 
can most heartily agree. The author is more 
conservative than many would expect him to be. 
This book is free from both petty controversies 
and caustic criticism. It affirms vastly more 
than it denies. There is no dogmatic creed, but 
deep-rooted and far-spreading convictions. Its 
message sweeps on in jubilant affirmations that 
run into tenderest appreciation of the good in all 
forms of religious symbolism and organization. 
What we find here may not be our faith, but it is 
a positive faith which commands and satisfies 
a heart in touch with the mysteries that arch 
above and the humanities that spread around us.

This appreciative discussion of great themes is 
well illustrated in the chapters which deal in 
helpful, because fresh and suggestive, fashion 
with such topics as " Being Religious," " Our 
Attitude to the Religious Beliefs of Others," 
the " Use of the word God" the " Ethical 
Christ." It is evident that a large majority are 
not yet prepared to accept many things here 
advanced, but all will admit the fair spirit that 
pervades these statements, which the majority 
may well read and ponder. Upon " Marriage," 
" The Family," " Government," and " Private 
Property," there is earnest teaching that will 
do much good, wholesome words much needed 
in these unsettled times. We may not approve 
every sentiment, but the moral fervor is de- 
lightful. This language has the impressiveness 
that inheres in a calm treatment that is never- 
theless tremendously earnest. The chapters on 
the " Value of Poetry " and the " Methods for 
Spiritual Culture " contain many ideas both 
fresh and helpful to all of us. 

This is no place for a discussion of what 
seems to many the fundamental weakness of 
the Ethical Movement, the hesitation in say- 
ing " God," and the absence of worship and of 
hope. And yet there is no lack of reverence. 
One feels at times that it is the excess of rev- 
erence that leads these people to capitalize 
"Love" and "Law," and hide their worship 
under such terms as " Spiritual Centre " and 
" Central Fact." The reader feels that he is in 
contact with more piety than comes to expres- 
sion. While following Mr. Sheldon through 
his intensely interesting chapter on the " Use 
of the word God" one wonders how such a 
man can keep his worship from finding expres- 
sion in words. However, this Ethical Move- 
ment is to be most cordially welcomed, even 
though it may stop short in some respects. It 
is itself probably a transition. It is surely not 
an eclipse but a readjustment of faith. And 
some day the ethical sentiment here accumu- 
lating will break into worship and say " God " 
most heartily, not in forgetf ulness of man, but 
in joyous recognition of his divine sonship.

AN AMERICAN IN EAST AFRICA.* 

Public attention has lately been attracted to 
Somaliland and the neighboring sections of 
Africa by the expedition of Mr. Astor Chan- 
dler, and also by that of Mr. D. G. Elliot of 
the Field Columbian Museum. In the book 
now before us, " Through Unknown African 
Countries," by Mr. A. Donaldson Smith of 
Philadelphia, we have an account of a success- 
ful hunting, collecting, and exploring trip, 
which extended as far as Lake Rudolf. The 
title of the book gives a somewhat exaggerated 
idea of the author's performance, for only an 
extremely small part of the route lay over really 
unknown territory, though most of it was in 
little explored regions, upon which Mr. Smith's 
descriptions and maps have thrown much new 
light. 

He first started by way of the southern bor- 
ders of Abyssinia, but was turned back by the 
warlike people of that country, and was com- 
pelled to make his journey by a more southern 
route, where he forced his way, not without 
bloodshed, through several weak tribes. For 
this, he has been sharply criticised ; but on the 
whole he seems to have acted as wisely as pos- 
sible upon the principle, accepted by most 
African explorers, that if a savage tribe will 
not allow you right of way, you must take it 
with as little compulsion as necessary. 

While Mr. Smith's account is in many parts 
rather too desultory, rapid, and superficial to 
be of the highest interest, and very rarely, 
indeed, gives evidence of close and thoughtful 
study, yet several incidents are told in a quite 
entertaining way, notably his experiences with 
Wal-da Gubbra and with the Arbore. There 
are also scattered throughout the work a num- 
ber of interesting observations on animals and 
men ; for example, this remark on the roar of 
a lion which he shot at a distance of a few 
feet: 

" I have heard it said that outside of menageries the 
lion's roar is not so thrilling as one might suppose; but 
this is not the case. I have never in my life heard any- 
thing more magnificent or awe-inspiring than the roar 
of a maddened lion. It makes every fiber of your body 
tingle, especially when you hear it at such close quar- 
ters as I was at this time." 

On another occasion, while waiting at night for 
lions, he found himself present at a fight be- 
tween a pack of some forty hyenas and three

Expedition from Somaliland to Lake Lamu. By A. Donald-

lions, in which the lions came off second best. 
He also narrates some stirring adventures with 
rhinoceroses, which frequently charged his 
party, and, he found, were as active as goats 
and as pugnacious as bulls. 

Mr. Smith's observations on men are in gen- 
eral not of as much interest as those on animals, 
and his remarks for the most part deal with 
rather superficial matters. In his statements 
on savage religion he more than once shows 
great ignorance, as will be obvious to anyone 
who will consider his brief references on pages 
176, 296, and 358. However, he makes two 
very interesting observations which illustrate 
wonderfully well the status of the very aged 
and the very young in savagery. 

" The Somalis are the best savages in Africa, but they 
have their little ways; and one is not to trouble about 
a woman after she gets old, whether she be a mother or 
sister. So many of the poor old wretches are doomed 
to wander about, picking berries, or begging, until they 
die of gradual starvation, or are caught by lions or 
hyenas. Almost continually there would be some of 
these old women following along the caravan, doing 
what work they could, bringing wood or water, for the 
sake of a few bones our boys would throw them." 

The children are precocious and ingenious, as 
appears from an incident that occurred among 
the Ogaden fugitives from the Abyssinians, 
which Mr. Smith relates as follows : 

" A little boy not over three years old amused me 
very much by begging for a little leather to make san- 
dals for himself. On handing him a knife and some 
oryx hide, the youngster set to work like an old shoe- 
maker, cutting strips oft' the leather for laces, and fash- 
ioning the sandals wonderfully well. One of the first 
things that strikes a stranger in Africa is the wonderful 
rapidity with which children develope. Real childhood 
is unknown, although manhood is never reached. The 
little ones are thrown on their own resources at such an 
early period that they quickly learn to act for them- 
selves in providing for the passing hour, and little more 
than this is attained in after-life. Our little visitor said 
that he had no relatives in the country, and no one to 
look after him; but he coolly intimated that he was 
going to follow the caravan till it reached some large 
village, where he could earn his living by minding goats 
and sheep." 

We wish Mr. Smith had given us a clue to the 
fate of this youngster. 

Mr. Smith discovered a tribe of pygmies, the 
Dume, near Lake Stephanie, but he was unable 
to make any thorough study of them. 

The literary style of this book, though fairly 
good, sometimes suffers from the careless use 
of English. The volume is fine, large, well- 
printed and well-illustrated, and contains scien- 
tific appendices of value.

EVOLUTION AS A POPULAR CREED.* 



Every theory which is eventually accepted passes 
through certain common stages in its history. It 
comes into existence first as the rough formulation 
of an advancing movement of thought; struggles 
for recognition, while being constantly modified ; 
and finally wins its way to popular acceptance, as- 
suming then a definite and crystallized form. When 
this last stage is reached, there is a tendency in 
those who accept it to rest back upon it, defend it 
by argument, and support it by authority. Mean- 
while the advancing line of investigation has often 
moved on elsewhere ; it in turn formulates its work- 
ing hypothesis, and repeats the struggle with the 
popular creed for recognition. 

A quarter of a century ago, evolution as a general 
theory of the development of organic life was still 
struggling for its existence against accepted tradi- 
tion and authority. To-day it is taken for granted 
everywhere among scientists, while those who re- 
cently fought it plume themselves upon accepting it 
and applying it to new spheres and even in some 
cases attempt to show that it is what always has 
been believed. The controversies in the present 
battle-ground of evolution are carried on quite 
largely by metaphysical reasoning, on the basis of 
the accepted theory and the great names by which 
it is supported. This has been particularly evident 
in the Spencer- Weissmann controversy. The appeal 
to what Darwin thought, and to what is regarded as 
essential to the accepted theory, has been more fre- 
quent than an effort to find the facts and to see in 
an unbiased spirit their meaning. 

Those who formulated for us the evolutionary 
hypothesis were intellectual giants who studied rev- 
erently the world of nature, and told what they 
found. Among those who are now champions of 
the theory are many men of small intellectual cali- 
bre, whose work is carried on in a spirit of blind 
reliance on the authority of science, in its theories 
and its methods : a dependence on authority as dog- 
matic as any ever presented in the history of the- 
ology. Emerson called attention to the fact that 
the true followers of great teachers are not found 
in their schools ; and there are many who cry " Dar- 
win, Darwin," who are in no wise admitted into the 
kingdom of science.

When it is remembered that every theory the 
world has seen has been misused, has passed from 
being the formulation of an advancing movement of 
thought to becoming a bulwark of dogmatism, the 
dangers to the theory of evolution resulting from 
its present popularity are obvious. No theory is 
ever fully comprehended until it is outgrown. The 
vocabulary we develope to formulate our attitude 
toward the world becomes a limiting form when 
accepted as complete and final, and we need to pass 
out of it to attain fresh and strong insight into the 
truth of things. When any adventitious principle, 
whether it be the authority of revelation or the 
method of induction, is accepted as an absolute test 
of truth, it tends to destroy the openness to new 
facts and ideas, and the constant positive activity of 
the intellect, without which we cease to progress in 
the attainment of truth, and rapidly undergo intel- 
lectual deterioration. 

Hence, if we are to escape dogmatism a dog- 
matism as paralyzing when clothed in the vocabu- 
lary of science as when expressed through the no- 
menclature of theology constant vigilance is 
necessary. We must struggle to take points of view 
widely different from our own. We must recognize 
the transitory character of every method of expres- 
sion and every system of theory developed to form- 
ulate the thought of some particular man or epoch. 
Perceiving the adventitious value which we inevit- 
ably give to modern thought, we must seek to cor- 
rect the distorted perspective by endeavoring to 
view the theory and terminology dominant among 
ourselves, from without as well as from within. As 
action is everywhere the law of life and progress, so 
it is preeminently in the intellectual world. Con- 
stant vigilance and unceasing effort are the price we 
must always pay for the active appreciation of truth. 

The four books grouped for the present review 
emphasize in different ways these thoughts. The 
first is a popular review of the progress of organic 
life, and a discussion of the relation of evolution to 
Christian thought ; and is addressed to a body of 
theological students. The second is a re-statement 
of the theory of evolution, and an attempt to show 
that all its salient features are found in the historical 
teaching of the Church ; and is written by a Catholic 
priest for his peculiar audience. The third is a dif- 
ficult presentation and discussion of evidence and 
arguments in relation to questions on the border- 
land of evolution ; while the fourth is the record of 
the life and work of one of the most characteristic 
figures among modern scientists. 

Professor Tyler's primary desire, in " The 
Whence and Whither of Man," is to show the har- 
mony of evolution with Protestant Christianity. The 
great steps forward in the progress of organic life 
are clearly and forcibly differentiated, and in so 
simple a way as to appeal to a popular audience. 
The philosophy of life is optimistic and pleasant, 
but in no way profound. It should certainly en- 
courage (as it is obviously intended to do) young 
men who expect to enter the ministry, to go on with

a warm welcome for the great generalizations of 
science, as helping rather than hindering their 
chosen work. Still, it is the popular creed of evolu- 
tion which the book cordially welcomes ; and it is 
doubtful if the spirit it inculcates would save the 
new generation, in its attitude toward struggling 
research, from the error of the theologians who met 
the first statement of Darwinism with vituperation 
and menace. The author is careful to avoid any 
possible classification of himself with Tyndall and 
Huxley, and his attitude is well illustrated by the 
fact that he finds it hard to avoid using "agnostic" 
as a term of reproach. The theory of evolution is 
stretched out of its ordinary shape in order to make 
it appear that the Bible teaches it ( cf. pp. 8 and 9). 
The author's interpretation of the Bible is by the 
conventional method of hunting out texts that seem 
to fit his theory, and construing them apart from 
their context. Professor Tyler uses his language so 
loosely as to increase the great teleological implica- 
tions of evolution to a questionable degree. The 
unscientific character of many of the arguments by 
analogy is obscured by the biological terminology 
used. He succeeds in showing the vital relation of 
higher human activities, especially religion and altru- 
ism, to the great process of evolution, and also 
makes it clear that these highest results are natural 
and inevitable, in conformity with the fundamental 
laws of organic life. 

In Father Zahm's statement of evolution, in his 
work on " Evolution and Dogma," and in his argu- 
ments in behalf of his more special thesis, he dis- 
plays all the merits of logical scholastic training. 
He succeeds in making a stronger case than might 
be anticipated for his fundamental claim that evo- 
lution is everywhere implied, or at least nowhere 
excluded, in the orthodox teaching of the Catholic 
Church. The deeper we study into the writings of 
the great fathers of Christian theology, the more we 
realize how many of the ideas which seem to us pe- 
culiar to these latter days were present in the brood- 
ing thought of that fermenting epoch. Yet Father 
Zahm fails to distinguish in importance between the 
vague notion of evolution, present or implied, in 
phases of ancient and mediaeval thought, and the 
definite formulation of hypotheses and methods as 
a working basis of science. The fact is, evolution as 
a theory of the development of adaptations in living 
organisms would never have come into being through 
a study of St. Augustine and St. Thomas. The 
arguments by which Father Zahm tries to establish 
the presence of the evolutionary theory in mediaeval 
philosophy and theology are interesting, but of small 
value. By isolating and interpreting passages apart 
from their context, and giving the same weight to 
what is implied and what is made explicit, it is pos- 
sible to derive almost any theory from almost any 
authority. It is such methods of interpretation that 
are here used. As the spirit of the work is that of 
the special pleader rather than the investigating 
scientist, it is not surprising to find Haeckel and 
others called by many hard names. What the au- 



thor has to say of monism and agnosticism is full 
of invective ; and he frequently shows his profession 
by his inability to weigh quietly the value of these 
different attitudes. Still, his protests against the 
vagaries of pseudo-science are valuable ; and he sees 
clearly the profound teleological implications of evo- 
lution. He recognizes the fact that the dignity of 
the Divine Being is in no way compromised by re- 
garding evolution as the method of creation ; and 
says wisely that " to say evolution is agnostic or 
atheistic in tendency, if not in fact, is to betray a 
lamentable ignorance of what it actually teaches " 
(page 389). On the whole, the author succeeds in 
showing that the general thought of evolution is not 
incompatible with some of the views of the scholas- 
tics ; but this is very far from his claim that all the 
essential theory of evolution is in these scholastic 
writings. One feels, in reading such a book, what 
a burden it is to be weighted down with a great 
mass of tradition and authority, with which one 
must make his science conform. At the same time 
one is impressed anew with the value of mediaeval 
thought for our modern world, if we are not ham- 
pered with a sense of it as authority. 

The unsettled character of the problems of evo- 
lution, and the wide differences of opinion which 
exist as to the relative importance of the separate 
elements of the problem, are well illustrated in Dr. 
Cope's " Primary Factors of Organic Evolution." 
Here, as everywhere else, the author's views are 
very suggestive and stimulating, although seriously 
hampered in effectiveness by an unnecessarily tech- 
nical nomenclature. This book consists of an ex- 
pansion, extension, and attempted verification of 
the argument in the author's earlier work on the 
" Origin of the Fittest." The chief thesis is that 
the larger part of variation is not accidental, but pur- 
posive, being along the lines of extension or limita- 
tion of organ and function through acceleration or 
retardation of growth. In this work, as in the earlier 
one, it is often difficult to perceive a real meaning 
behind the terms used. Romanes is quoted as say- 
ing of the American Neo-Lamarckians, that " they 
do not distinguish between the statement of facts in 
terms of a proposition and an explanation of them 
in terms of causality." Although the author holds 
this charge to be now unwarranted, a careful read- 
ing of his present work deepens the impression that 
Romanes's criticism is a fair statement of the case. 
The confusion mentioned is made more possible by 
the use of so difficult a terminology. The facts on 
which the arguments of the present work are based 
are drawn chiefly from paleontology ; and the author 
succeeds in making a very strong case in defense of 
the significance of Lamarckian factors. The book 
is a healthy antidote to Weissmann's metaphysics, 
and seems at least to show how unsettled are all the 
problems on the borderland of evolution. Anyone 
who will take the pains necessary to understand the 
author's meaning must find the work peculiarly 
virile in opening up new chains of reflection. In 
addition to an immense amount of work in observ-

ing and gathering together scientific data, the author 
possesses an unusual ability to perceive the philo- 
sophical implications of biological facts. Such dis- 
cussions as that regarding the parallelism between 
heredity and conscious memory, or that concerning 
the " Energy of Evolution," as characteristic of 
organic life alone, serve to show the depth of philo- 
sophic reflection in the work. One feels occasionally 
the absence of that wholly impersonal spirit of 
investigation and discussion which it would seem 
should naturally be present in all science, but which 
is unfortunately often wanting in the scientist as 
elsewhere in the world of thought. The work 
focuses in interest upon the author's theory of con- 
sciousness. He questions whether consciousness, 
instead of being a last result of the unconscious pro- 
cesses of mind, be not rather a fundamental quality 
of protoplasm. If this be true, all organic functions 
must be regarded as having been at first conscious, 
and only having become unconscious with long- 
continued use. This view is obviously revolutionary, 
making consciousness, instead of an insignificant 
result, a positive and fundamental cause throughout 
the process of biological evolution, as it certainly is 
in the higher human life. There is much to be 
said in defense of this view, and it is in any case 
extremely suggestive. It is strange how the auto- 
matic theory of animal action has survived in shapes 
parallel to that given it by Descartes ; while every 
step of our modern biological investigation has 
shown more certainly the unity of the laws acting 
throughout the organic world. Professor Cope's 
main contention, that evolutionary theories hitherto 
have been occupied with explanations of the process 
of development, and have given no solution to the 
problem of the positive causes of evolution, is un- 
questionably just. The only points at which we are 
skeptical are : whether anywhere in science the 
human intellect has shown itself capable of under- 
standing more than the process, while ultimate causes 
remain unknown ; and whether Cope's theories, 
freed from their technical vocabulary come nearer 
than others to an explanation of the ultimate causes 
of evolution. 

Romanes's " Life and Letters " appeals to two 
distinct types of readers. The constant discussion 
of technical questions in letters to and from his 
fellow-workers gives the book an interest for the 
scientist who studies the questions upon which Ro- 
manes spent his life. On the other hand, the inter- 
esting story of the development of a man, focusing 
as it does upon the religious problem peculiar to our 
time, gives the book a value for all who care to un- 
derstand the deeper problems of living. The work 
consists so largely of Romanes's letters that it is 
really autobiographical. Mrs. Romanes has done 
her work as editor very skilfully, adding only the 
thread of narrative necessary to the unity of the 
work and the understanding of the letters. Her 
admirable taste and restraint are deserving of all 
praise. The brief narrative is remarkably grave 
and impersonal, and yet one is made to feel the 



background of deep personal affection, too sacred 
to be superficially displayed. The character pre- 
sented in this book is most admirable. Generous, 
chivalrous, open-hearted, sincerely and enthusiast- 
ically devoted to truth, yet finely sensitive to friend- 
ship and to those arts which give a higher beauty 
to human life, the personal character of Romanes 
is in every way inspiring and helpful. His life in 
the main was remarkably even ; in personal asso- 
ciations, in education, in activities, unperturbed by 
tides of struggle and storms of mi sad jus tin en t. The 
positive struggle of his life centres in the develop- 
ment of his religious faith. Early accepting the 
frank agnosticism of the average scientific worker, 
the philosophical and reflective character of his mind 
made it impossible for him lightly to set aside ulti- 
mate problems, as is easy for many experimentalists. 
The philosophic implications in all of his experi- 
mental work were of the deepest interest to him ; 
and he followed every point of view which he ac- 
cepted out to its speculative conclusion. He was 
always a disciple of the religion of truth. The ear- 
nest desire to test all things, and hold fast to noth- 
ing, however dear to him, which would not bear the 
most rigid investigation, dominated him throughout 
his life. He admitted frankly, while accepting it, 
that " naturalism " was an utterly hopeless doctrine, 
and never attempted to cheat himself or others into 
believing it otherwise. Stricken down with a mor- 
tal illness at the very height of his activity, with his 
largest plans of work but partly carried out, the last 
years of his life were spent in an unavailing struggle 
to regain health, with alternating periods of hope- 
ful work and enforced idleness. In this period of 
his life he works back to an earnest and essentially 
Christian faith. This seems to have been no sudden 
conversion, but the cumulative result of a long pro- 
cess of development. It is this change in his intel- 
lectual attitude which gives deepest interest to his 
life. Many different views are possible as to its 
significance. Those who have one cause to uphold 
may regard it as the inevitable return to the true 
faith which is coming in all modern science. Their 
opponents may look upon it as a weak falling away 
from the courageous attitude of Romanes's man- 
hood, due to his physical breakdown. Yet do not 
both of these views miss the essential point in the 
problem ? The generalizations of modern biological 
science, the laws of the struggle for existence and 
survival of the fittest, are preeminently a gospel of 
success ; and they are particularly a gospel for the 
successful. Christianity in all its characteristic 
phases has always been a gospel for the weak and 
heavy-laden, for those who have failed in the outer 
struggle of life. One's attitude toward life is always 
more or less dependent upon one's personal experi- 
ence ; and it is questionable whether a philosophy 
of life that is drawn from an easily achieved suc- 
cess is as interpretative of the love, tenderness, and 
infinite compassion and self-sacrifice of the higher 
human nature, as one drawn from a wider range of 
experience, involving the struggle and sorrow, often

THE DIAL

unavailing, which characterize so wide an area of 
human existence. There is a gospel of failure as 
well as a gospel of success. The mystery of life is 
not easily to be set aside by cheap theories and 
smart sayings ; and the experiences which unseal 
one's spiritual vision to the deeper truths in human 
life may perhaps be regarded as the " divine min- 
istry of sorrow." In the presence of such deeper 
phases of human experience the popular creed of 
evolution, like all other popular creeds, seems peurile. 
Browning's " Abt Vogler " sings with daring pride : 
" Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear, 

Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe : 
But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear ; 

The rest may reason and welcome ; 't is we musicians know." 

If we understand by " musicians " those who through 
the deeps of personal experience have entered into 
a positive appreciation of the spiritual harmony of 
the universe, the justness of Abt Vogler's claim is 
evident. We "appreciate" much that we never 
understand. The human love, the beauty and truth 
that answer the strivings of our nature are never 
fully comprehended by the understanding. Life 
continually transcends our logic ; and any theory 
which ignores simple facts of universal human expe- 
rience is a creed to be amended or discarded. After 
all has been said, it remains true that the love which 
would sacrifice itself infinitely and forever for the 
loved one, the hunger after absolute justice, the de- 
votion to ideals which makes " the passing shadow" 
of Time serve our will, the need to find a permanent 
to give meaning to the otherwise irrational process 
of change which is the universe, are facts of the 
higher human life, as real as any others in the world. 
Somehow in the great process of evolution these 
facts have come to be, and any theory of the world 
which ignores or fails to interpret them has not said 
the last word about the mystery of existence, how- 
ever arrogantly it may be championed. In the 
presence of such a creed it is the part of wisdom to 
" Cleave ever to the sunnier side of doubt, 

And cling to Faith beyond the forms of Faith," 
to trust life and the revelations of experience, rather 
than an inadequate theory of life.

Mr. Sarrie's 
memoirs of 
hit mother. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Even the most severe reviewer should 
be mollified by Mr. Barrie's memoir 
of his mother, " Margaret Ogilvy " 
(Scribner). He may not care for it all, but whoever 
has been once seized with the fever for literature 
will surely be hard hearted if he read entirely un- 
moved this story of a man of letters and his mother. 
This mother sympathized with her son's ambition, 
as other mothers have sympathized : who that has 
written does not recollect that kindly listener? She 
was proud of him, proud but fearful. He must go 
up to London where there was a field for young men 
of letters ; she acquiesced, but shrank with terror 



from the garrets in which " the poor fellows sat 
abject, and the park seats where they too often 
passed the night." When the terror of absolute 
failure passed away, it was only to leave her in 
apprehension as to the possible value of those slight 
matters which she had herself helped by her recol- 
lections of older days. She could hardly believe 
that " Auld Licht Idylls " were read with pleasure 
in London ; she could not help thinking " the Lon- 
don editor a fine fellow, but slightly soft." Then, 
when success was assured, there came a worse trial. 
There was the awful jealousy of those who were 
held greater than her son ; and, more awful still, the 
temptation to think that there might be something 
in the idea. The novels of Stevenson were both a 
delight and a torment. Finally came the confident 
happiness in her son's assured work, and the ill- 
concealed pleasure at seeing how much of it she had 
herself inspired. The heroines in those beloved 
stories, they were a constant source of joy to her ; 
in them, more than any other possibility, did she 
see how much she was to her son, and to such a 
mother not much more is needed. There must be 
many who have brought their first work to that 
critic so competent to judge impartially the fruit of 
one's labors. But not very many have there been 
in whom the relation has been productive of so much. 
" Margaret Ogilvy " is not a mere account of Mrs. 
Barrie's relation to the world of letters, but that 
especial part of it must appeal first to the man who 
writes. If our sympathy with the rest be not quite 
so keen, it is not so much against it. One hardly 
needs to commend the book ; in it Mr. Barrie is on 
a high level in more senses than one. The elements 
of interest we have, in a measure, met with before ; 
but the great difference is that here we have fact 
instead of fiction. In some eyes that is an advan- 
tage. The fact is, as far as criticism is concerned, 
that if " Margaret Ogilvy " were fiction it would be 
a far greater achievement even than it is. Just 
because it is truth, however, it ceases, one might 
almost say, to be an achievement at all ; and. be- 
comes something better to those who enjoy it, as 
doubtless it was to the author. 

The contrast in spirit and method 
between African psychology of to- 
day and that of thirty years ago is 
brought forcibly to our attention by Mr. John 
Douglas Sterrett's " Power of Thought " (Scribner). 
The thesis which the author presents may be stated 
as follows : Thought is the controlling power in the 
world of human activity. The idea of an action 
deliberately selected from a number of competitors 
is the only discoverable cause of the more important 
forms of conduct. But thought announces itself as 
an activity independent of the brain and in every 
respect free from the control of the laws of the ma- 
terial universe. The attempt to cast discredit upon 
this testimony of self-consciousness by resolving 
thought into sensation is doomed to failure, for 
thought is not sensation but simply works with it as

with a given material. Man, then, the thinker, is a 
free agent ; which was the point to he proved. Most 
of these propositions are worthy of serious consider- 
ation, and at least one that which affirms the inti- 
mate relation between thought and the resultant 
bodily movements represents an assured result of 
psychological research. This is the only claim which 
the book has upon the attention of serious students 
of to-day. The argument recalls all that was worst 
in the American text-books of psychology and ethics 
of a generation ago, with none of their redeeming 
features. Platitude alternates with an incoherence 
that often degenerates into pure nonsense ; impas- 
sioned assertion is mistaken for evidence ; complete 
assurance is exhibited in the criticism of views the 
force and even nature of which the author does not 
in the least comprehend. Such ignorance is all the 
more wonderful because the author informs us that 
his " whole life has been one unending, impetuous, 
uncrushable, and consciously thoughtful (personal 
and responsible) irruption upon the kingdoms of 
matter and mind." The saving element of the book 
is its unconscious humor. The patronizing air with 
which the " scientist " and the " logician" with their 
" dusky prattle " are shown the error of their ways, 
the sublime confidence with which the development 
of the infant mind is sketched with material drawn 
solely from the imagination, and an estimate of the 
reasoning powers of animals is offered on a basis of 
two anecdotes one a story of " those halcyon days 
[when he] companioned with an intelligent cur," 
all this and much else is delightful beyond descrip- 
tion, and can only be equalled by the best passages 
from Diedrich Knickerbocker's " History of New 
York." Some of the descriptions and definitions 
deserve to become classic. A sensation is declared 
to be " a mode of brain [which] swims into the 
mind's presence, giving the latter an opportunity 
instantly to lay hold of an object lodged in the sen- 
sorium." We have no space for further quotation, 
but perhaps enough has been said to convince the 
reader that in the words of our author " such lavish 
blundering," even if " not very instructive, may be 
a trifle picturesque." 

Professor Florian Cajori's " History 
of Elementary Mathematics " (Mac- 
millan) is evidently the product of 
wide and scholarly research. It traces the streams of 
mathematical science, if not to their original springs, 
to sources far remote in the history of man. The 
germs of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry appear 
in Egyptian hieroglyphics that were carved in stone 
four thousand, perhaps five thousand, years ago. 
Later, both arithmetic and algebra were developed 
by the Hindus, from whom they came to Europe 
through Arabic channels. The word algebra does 
not, as we have supposed, point to Gebir, a Spanish 
Moor, but appeared two hundred years before his 
time in the title of a treatise called " Aldschebr 
Walmukabela." The first word meant " restora- 
tion," and pointed to the artifice now called trans-

position. Geometry was brought from Egypt to 
Greece by Thales (about 675 B. C.), was developed 
by the Pythagoreans, and culminated in the Ele- 
ments of Euclid (300 B. C.), who remained for two 
thousand years the acknowledged master of the 
science, and whose powerful influence has not yet 
been fully superseded. Trigonometry originated 
with Hipparchus, the chief of ancient astrono- 
mers, who lived about 150 B. C. In tracing the 
early progress of these sciences, the marvel appears 
that the world should have been so long in discov- 
ering those concepts which we now recognize as 
necessary and fundamental. Thus, in numbers, the 
use of the zero and the principle of local values 
were not known until they were discovered by the 
Hindus as late as the sixth century A. D., and were 
not introduced into Europe until the twelfth cen- 
tury. Not until 1585 was the use of the decimal 
point indicated by Stevin of Belgium, and then 
imperfectly. With others, the present author notes 
the mathematical misfortune that man developed 
only five fingers on each hand, when he should have 
had six ; therefore he has learned to count by tens 
rather than by twelves, and hence has a decimal 
rather than a duodecimal notation. As it is, twelve 
appears in the dozen, and in months, pence, inches, 
and ounces ; and it submits to division by prime 
factors more than does any other number less than 
sixty. For its historical facts and its suggestiveness, 
this work should be read carefully by all students 
and teachers of mathematics. Too much stress can 
hardly be laid upon the fact that mathematics is an 
active stimulant to the powers of observation. Noth- 
ing avails so much to the mathematical student as a 
clear understanding of the theme offered for discus- 
sion, with an intelligent power to interpret results. 
The mathematical idiom invites the most careful 
linguistic scrutiny, while all linguistic study will be 
sharpened by the clear precision of mathematical 
acumen. 



An interesting 

volume on 

the Thackerays. 



Sir William Wilson Hunter's book 
" The Thackerays in India " ( Henry 
Frowde ) wins attention by the 
charmed name on its handsome covers. Our Thack- 
eray, however, left India when he was only six years 
old, and consequently it is with the earlier genera- 
tions of Thackerays that the volume deals chiefly. 
The first Thackeray in India went there in 1766, a 
lad of seventeen, to accept a Writership in the East 
India Company's service. Like his celebrated grand- 
son, he bore the favorite combination of family 
names William Makepeace. Four of his sons, and 
at least fourteen of his descendants and collaterals, 
followed the same profession, and those who are 
curious in the study of heredity may learn much 
that is interesting about the Thackeray family tree. 
But after all, the romantic strain seems to have come 
through the ancestry of the grandmother (Amelia 
Richmond- Webb) ; and the greatest single influence 
of the novelist's life-work was his mother, Anne 
Beecher. She it was who furnished the inspiration

for his fine tributes to woman ; and from his own 
experience he drew such paragraphs as these : " A 
good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms un- 
der heaven, and we look with love and wonder upon 
its silent grace, its pure fragrance, its delicate bloom 
of beauty. . . . Lucky is he in life who knows a few 
such women ! A kind providence of Heaven it was 
that sent us such, and gave us to admire that touching 
and wonderful spectacle of innocence and love and 
beauty." Thackeray was an only child ; the same 
gentle eyes that filled with joy when he was born, 
wept with sorrow when he was laid under the sod ; 
and on the first anniversary of his death, she fol- 
lowed him to her own grave. She is immortal in 
the immortality of the manliest and tenderest man 
of letters of our age. Sir William's volume is an 
interesting one, and a valuable addition to literary 

history. 

Mr. George Meredith's "Essay on 
Comedy and the Uses of the Comic 
Spirit " was written twenty years ago, 
and delivered as a lecture before the London Insti- 
tution. Published now in a small and attractive 
volume by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, it will 
command a large audience as the utterance of one of 
the greatest living masters of English fiction. Read- 
ers of "The Egoist" are familiar, in a general 
way, with Mr. Meredith's conception of the place of 
comedy in a civilization. In the present work he 
asserts positively that there never will be civilization 
where comedy is not possible ; that comedy comes 
only from some degree of social equality of the 
sexes, and that it is for cultivated women to recog- 
nize that the Comic Muse is one of their best friends. 
An interesting distinction is made between comedy 
and the other powers that produce laughter : differ- 
ing from satire in not driving sharply into the quiv- 
ering sensibilities, from irony in not stinging under 
a half-caress, from humor in having a narrower 
scope the humorist of high order having an em- 
brace of contrasts beyond the scope of the comic 
poet. According to Mr. Meredith, a good test of 
an individual's capacity for comic perception is 
found when he is able to detect the ridicule of them 
he loves, without loving them less ; and more, by 
being able to see himself somewhat ridiculous in 
dear eyes, and accepting the correction their image 
of him proposes. 

The wide learning and tireless re- 
search of the Rev. John Owen (an 
English clergyman) were combined 
with a character of rare simplicity and a gracious 
spirit. He was as fearless in his rationalism as he 
was tender and earnest in his reverence. His mind 
was as free as his heart was devout. The last pro- 
duct of his hospitable and far-ranging mind, com- 
pleted shortly before his death, has been issued in 
a substantial volume from the Putnam press. In 
this work he makes a comparative study of " The 
Five Great Skeptical Dramas of History " the 
" Prometheus Vinctus " of -ZEschylus, the " Book of

Job," Goethe's " Faust," Shakespeare's " Hamlet," 
and " El Magico Prodigioso " of Calderon. These 
masterpieces are interpreted with special reference 
to the play of skeptical thought upon the deep prob- 
lems of life, which they all in different ways exhibit. 
Here is something more than literary criticism ; and 
yet all students of literature will find profit from 
these pages, which open up new points of view and 
make familiar subjects freshly interesting by fram- 
ing them in the large horizon of universal history. 
Here, too, is something quite different from ordin- 
ary theological discussion ; and yet no student of 
religion can afford to ignore these rich materials of 
prophecy, so unconventional, but so genuine and so 
stimulating. Every earnest student of the great 
problems of human thought will find himself en- 
riched by this contribution, and will turn from its 
perusal with a deep sense of gratitude to Mr. Owen 
for a treatise abundant in information, prolific in 
suggestions, ennobling in character, fearless in spirit, 
reverent in temper, and everywhere broadly human. 
Specialists will probably qualify some of his state- 
ments and even combat some of his conclusions ; 
though the most censorious will surely commend 
his noble sobriety of tone and breadth of learning. 

Mr. Charles A. Cooper's " Editor's 
Retrospect" (Macmillan) is mainly 
the story of the fifty years' profes- 
sional life of a distinguished British journalist, some- 
what in the vein of Mr. G. A. Sala's reminiscences. 
Mr. Cooper is editor of " The Scotsman," and he 
devotes some informing chapters to the history of 
that excellent politico-literary sheet. The paper, it 
may be remembered, was founded in 1817 to secure 
a hearing for the long-smothered protests against 
the oppression of Scotch Toryism a Toryism then 
more high-handed and unbending than that of En- 
gland. In the adoption of such devices of modern 
newspaper enterprise as the special wire, the special 
train, etc., the Edinburgh journal seems to have led 
the way, and London followed. Unlike most vet- 
erans, Mr. Cooper is not disposed to glorify the past 
at the cost of the present. He does not look back 
upon a golden age of journalism, rather, he looks 
forward for one. Journalism, he thinks, " was never 
so good as it is now ; and it will be better. There 
are more able men engaged in newspapers now than 
there were in the wooden press days." One may 
easily agree with Mr. Cooper as to the ability, the 
keenness, the exceeding facility (too often " fatal ") 
of current journalism. Would that its morals had 
kept pace with its wits ! Mr. Cooper's narrative is 
freely sprinkled with anecdotes of London and Ed- 
inburgh notabilities, and there is an amusing chap- 
ter or so of angling recollections. Among the lat- 
ter are some notes on the peculiarities of the High- 
land " ghillie," notably his liking for whisky. One 
morning at the locks Mr. Cooper overheard a dispute 
between the ghillies outside his window as to the 
merits of their respective " shentlemen." The voice 
of his own man soon rose high and triumphant over

the rest : " You call your man a shentleman ? Him ! 
Look at his flask ! Look at my shentleman's flask !

conclusive.

although in his thirty-seventh year, 
was perhaps the greatest African explorer of our 
century. Joseph Thomson made no less than five 
distinct expeditions, one in Northwest Africa, one in 
West Africa, one in South Africa, and three in East 
Africa, all successful in throwing light on the geol- 
ogy and geography of these sections. He published 
his results in various papers and books, of which the 
best known and most notable is " Through Masai- 
Land." His brother, the Rev. J. B. Thomson, has 
written his biography, " Joseph Thomson, African 
Explorer" (imported by Charles Scribner's Sons), 
in a pleasant and interesting way, though of course 
from a very sympathetic point of view. In fact, 
the work savors almost too much of the spirit of an 
In Memoriam to be a biography in the largest and 
best sense of the term. Selections from Thomson's 
letters constitute the most important part of this 
volume, and they are often of interest as throwing 
light both on himself and on the men with whom he 
came in contact. Thus, he remarks of Cecil Rhodes : 
" His education is that of the mining-camp grafted 
on a university training, and he consequently often 
expresses himself and acts in a manner calculated 
to shock people at home, accustomed to the refined 
statesman full of suave language. How can you at 
home appreciate the character of a premier who 
delights to hang about a club bar, drinking whiskies 
and sodas, while with a word here and there be- 
tween he settles the affairs of a country half the 
size of Europe ? He would be an impossible per- 
son in England ; but for South Africa he is simply 
the ideal man, and throughout the length and 
breadth of the country he is recognized as such." 
The present work has a number of good maps, and 
some rather indifferent illustrations. 

Mrs. E. W. Latimer has added to her 
series of contemporaneous history a 
volume on " Italy in the Nineteenth 
Century" (McClurg). It is history made easy for 
both writer and reader, being largely historical gos- 
sip gathered about an outline of facts that is none 
too clear. The author's historical judgments and 
many of her facts are those generally current, rather 
than the results of profound study of the sources. 
It is to be said, however, that in the other volumes 
of the series, if not in this, the author modestly dis- 
claims profound scholarship, her aim being to bring 
together an interesting tale for him that reads as he 
runs. In this she succeeds, though not so well in 
this volume as in some of the others. Her personal 
experiences and observation have not served her as 
well, and the subject is more difficult in itself to 
give unity of interest. The account of the history 



of the last twenty years is the most useful portion 
of the book, in which we get a good account of the 
recent difficulties and the present conditions of this 
in many ways unfortunate country. The publishers 
have provided twenty- four excellent portraits, which 
add interest and value to the book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. James Lowry Whittle's " Grover Cleveland " 
(Warne) is a volume in the " Public Men of To-day " 
series, the object of which is to present " a study of the 
career of some conspicuous personage in each nation- 
ality." The choice of Mr. Cleveland as the representative 
American for the purpose for which this series is designed 
is hardly open to question, for, as the author says, " in the 
case of the United States of America, there is no one now 
alive who has played so important a part, and who, at the 
same time, possesses so distinct a personality as Grover 
Cleveland." Mr. Whittle is an Englishman, but he has 
given us the best study of our late President that has 
yet been written, and impresses the reader as being at 
all essential points well-informed and sound in judg- 
ment. The book was completed just before the election 
of last November. 

Mr. Woodrow Wilson has become known of late years 
to readers of the better magazines as one of the most 
graceful and stimulating of our serious American essay- 
ists. A volume now made up of these contributions to 
the periodical press is called " Mere Literature and 
Other Essays " (Houghton), and includes seven familiar 
numbers, together with an essay on Burke here printed 
for the first time. It is as great a pleasure to read these 
essays the second time as it was the first, and a marked 
satisfaction to have them thus brought together within 
a single set of covers. 

Some excellent biographical writing is to be found in 
Prof. W. P. Trent's volume on " Southern Statesmen of 
the Old Regime," which forms a number in Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s " Library of Economics and Pol- 
itics." The substance of the book is a series of popular 
lectures delivered by Professor Trent at the University 
of Wisconsin last year; the subjects range from Wash- 
ington to Davis, and the treatment is sympathetic and 
independent. The book is illustrated with portraits, 
but lacks an index. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons now publish the novels 
of Mr. Harold Frederic in a new and uniform five- 
volume edition. The set includes " The Damnation of 
Theron Ware," The Lawton Girl," " Seth's Brother's 
Wife," " In the Valley," and " In the Sixties." To the 
latter volume, which seems to come first in the series, 
Mr. Frederic contributes an interesting preface, telling 
how he came to be a novelist, and throwing some inter- 
esting side-lights upon his literary career. 

The series of " Handbooks of English Literature " 
(Macmillan), edited by Professor Hales, now includes, 
besides Dr. Garnett's " The Age of Dryden " and Mr. 
Dennis's " The Age of Pope," a third volume by Pro- 
fessor C. H. Herford, entitled "The Age of Words- 
worth." When the five additional volumes already 
announced shall have been written, we shall have in the 
series as a whole a practically continuous history of 
English literature. Mr. Herford's contribution to this 
work covers the period from the publication of the 
Lyrical Ballads " (1798) to the first appearance of Ten- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



nyson (1830). It is as good a condensed treatment of 
the period as has yet been made; the style and the phi- 
losophical breadth of view displayed by the writer leave 
little to be desired, while the soundness of his judgment 
gives a high critical value to the work. 

" The College Year-Book and Athletic Record for the 
Academic Year 1896-97," compiled by Mr. Edward 
Emerson, Jr., and published by Messrs. Stone & Kim- 
ball, is a sort of American " Minerva," and we are very 
thankful that the work has been undertaken. The 
greater part of the nearly six hundred pages is devoted 
to descriptions and faculty lists of the American institu- 
tions that confer degrees, the arrangement being alpha- 
betical. Such subjects as fraternities, colors, yells, and 
college publications, as well as the athletic record of the 
year, are compactly given in the closing sections. There 
are mistakes, of course, as was inevitable in the first 
issue of such a work, but we are not disposed to dwell 
upon them, so creditable is the general plan, and so vast 
the amount of information afforded. 

In " The Argentaurum Papers," Number 1, " Con- 
cerning Gravitation " (Plain Citizen Publishing Co., New 
York) the author, Mr. Stephen H. Emmens, the well- 
known inventor of the high explosive, emmensite, ad- 
vances some novel, and indeed startling, propositions in 
science. He starts out with an extended mathematical 
discussion of some of the fundamental propositions in 
Newton's Principia, pointing out what he regards as 
Newton's mistakes, which have misled all subsequent 
mathematicians and physicists. Out of his corrections 
he developes a new theory of gravitation, leading to 
the conclusion, taking into account also centrifugal mo- 
tion, that the earth is a comparatively hollow shell of 
unequal thickness. He further proceeds to the follow- 
ing revolutionary generalizations, which we give in his 
own words: "We are thus led to the great generaliza- 
tion that Space is Energy." " Gravitation is caused by 
Energy being more abundantly present in Matter occu- 
pied space than in other regions." The author, who is 
evidently a man of profound convictions, seems through- 
out especially solicitous as to how his work will be 
received. But if he is possessed of the true scien- 
tific spirit, he can rest in serenity, now that his book is 
given to the world; well knowing that, while error is 
certain to fail, the truth, as certainly, will ultimately 
prevail. 

Professor F. H. Storer's " Agriculture in some of Its 
Relations with Chemistry " is published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons in a new " Seventh edition," 
revised and enlarged. The work occupies three large 
volumes, and is issued at a very moderate price. It is 
based upon the author's lectures given from 1871 to 
1897 at the Bussey Institution, and provides a very 
thorough discussion of the chemistry of agriculture. 
" Gentleman " farmers, as well as the professional horny- 
handed variety, will find the work of the greatest utility 
and attractiveness. 

It is hardly too much to say that in the revised edi- 
tion of his " Primer of English Literature " (Macmillan), 
now simply entitled " English Literature," Mr. Stop- 
ford Brooke has given us the ideal book of its sort. For 
a sketch of these dimensions the little book could hardly 
be improved upon, and we should like to see it used as 
a text by every secondary school in the country. We 
note with particular satisfaction that the author has 
taken good heed of Matthew Arnold's suggestions and 
has accepted nearly all of them. It is evident that the 
revision has been more than perfunctory, and that every 



phrase has been scrutinized anew in the interests of 
both compactness and felicity of expression. 

Mr. T. Bailey Saunders has added a new volume (the 
seventh) to his series of translations from the miscel- 
laneous writings of Schopenhauer (Macmillan). " On 
Human Nature " is the title of this selection, and the 
contents are drawn from the chapters entitled " Zur 
Ethik " and " Zur Rechtslehre und Politik." Among the 
subjects discussed are government, character, moral 
instinct, and the problem of determinism. It need not 
be said that the thought is both weighty and suggestive; 
there are no lees in Schopenhauer's cask, for he never 
wrote for the mere sake of writing, but always because 
he had something definite and important to say. 

Messrs. Allyn & Bacon send us the eighth edition of 
Professor F. W. Kelsey's school text of Caesar's " Gallic 
War." The text is now printed with indicated quanti- 
ties, and in other respects also exhibits improvements 
over the form in which it first appeared about ten years 
ago. From Messrs. Ginn & Co. we have Book IX. 
of the " ^Eneid," edited by Mr. E. H. Cutler; and a 
volume of " Easy Latin for Sight Reading," edited by 
Mr. B. L. D'Ooge. Messrs. Leach, She well & Sanborn 
publish a " New Latin Composition," by Mr. M. G. 
Daniell ; and a " Greek and Roman Mythology," by Pro- 
fessors K. P. Harrington and Herbert C. Tolman. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " A Primer of 
French Pronunciation," by Dr. John E. Matzke; Bal- 
zac's " Le Cure* de Tours, and Other Stories," edited by 
Professor F. M. Warren ; and George Sand's " La Mare 
au Diable," edited by Professor E. S. Joynes. Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. publish " Napole*on," a volume of extracts 
from the best writers upon the Napoleonic period, ed- 
ited by Professor Alce*e Fortier, who links the extracts 
by means of his own narrative. The same editor has 
prepared Moliere's " Les Femmes Savantes " for Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co., and the book appears in their well- 
known " Modern Language " series. 

In " An Old English Grammar and Exercise Book " 
(Allyn & Bacon), Dr. C. A. Smith of the Louisiana 
State University gives a clear and accurate statement 
of the elementary principles of Anglo-Saxon. Phonology 
is simply but not extensively treated, but the chapters 
on etymology and syntax are full and well supplied with 
exercises of a practical character. The etymological 
hints in the vocabularies and the English exercises for 
translation into Anglo-Saxon are valuable features of the 
book. The reading selections are possibly not quite full 
enough. The work will be useful especially to teachers 
who do not wish a book so advanced as B right's " Reader." 



ZjITERARY NOTES. 

" The Forcing-Book," by L. H. Bailey, is the latest

text-book of " Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry," the 
work of Messrs. F. H. Bailey and F. S. Woods, both of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

" The Use of Analysis in Logical Composition " is a 
pamphlet by Dr. Edwin M. Hopkins, issued by the 
Journal Publishing Co., of Lawrence, Kansas. 

" Cuba in War Time," written by Richard Harding 
Davis and illustrated by Frederic Remington, has just 
been published by Mr. R. H. Russell of New York. 

Two important novels to be published at once by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. are Miss Beatrice Harra- 
den's story of California life, " Hilda Strafford," and 
Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's " The Great K. & A. Train 
Robbery." 

"The American Claimant, and Other Stories and 
Sketches," by Mark Twain, is a volume of odds and 
ends, among which we recognize two or three familiar 
and perhaps famous pieces. It is published by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers in their standard library edition. 

Scott's " Ivanhoe " and Bulwer-Lytton's " The Last 
of the Barons " are the latest additions to the excellent 
" Illustrated English Library " (imported by Putnams). 
Mr. C. E. Brock and Mr. Fred. Pegram are the illus- 
trators of the respective volumes, and the work in each 
case is well done. 

Samuel C. Griggs, the pioneer book publisher of 
Chicago, died on the 4th of April, at the age of seventy- 
five. A short time before his death he sold his pub- 
lishing business to Messrs. Scott, Foresman, & Co., who 
now issue the books that for so many years bore the 
imprint of S. C. Griggs & Co. 

A welcome addition to the beautiful little " Temple 
Classics " (Macmillan) is a new edition of Florio's trans- 
lation of the " Essayes" of Montaigne, revised and edited 
by Mr. A. R. Waller. The edition will be in six vol- 
umes, the first of which is now ready. The second part 
of Malory's "Morte Darthur" has also been published 
in the same series. 

A dinner of the publishers, booksellers, and stationers 
of Chicago will be given April 22, and promises to be 
an important event for these business interests, as it is 
expected that a permanent organization will be effected. 
The matter is in charge of a committee of which Mr. 
R. K. Smith of Messrs. McClurg & Co. is Treasurer 
and Mr. T. H. Devereaux of Messrs. Rand, McNally & 
Co. Secretary. 

" Art et Decoration " is the title of a new monthly 
review of modern art which has begun publication in 
France under the editorship of M. Thie'bault-Sisson and 
a committee composed of several of the best known 
French artists and designers. The first number, dated 
January, is well printed and beautifully illustrated, and 
contains several interesting articles. The American 
Architect and Building News Co. of Boston are the 
American agents for this periodical. 

Prof. Edward D. Cope, one of the most distinguished 
of American men of science, died at his home in Phila- 
delphia on the 12th of April. He was the author of 
350 scientific papers, devoted chiefly to researches in 
paleontology and to phases of the doctrine of evolution, 
and at his death occupied a professor's chair in the 
school of biology of the University of Pennsylvania. 
His last important publication, " The Primary Factors 
of Organic Evolution," is reviewed in this issue of THE 
DIAL. 

A new " Encyclopedia of American Biography " is in 
preparation under the management of the American 



Publishers' Association of Chicago. It is to be in a 
single volume, compactly written and printed, and aims 
at greater comprehensiveness than has been attained by 
any similar work ; in fact, it is intended to include " ap- 
propriate notices of all persons who have risen to any 
considerable degree of prominence." Current biography 
i. e., notices of persons still living will, we infer 
from the prospectus, have the lion's share of the space. 
The work is under the editorial charge of Mr. Thomas 
W. Herringshaw, and is expected to appear in the fall 
of 1898. 

The Burrows Brothers Co., of Cleveland, have just 
secured for their issue of " The Jesuit Relations and 
Allied Documents," being edited for them by Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites, the original manuscript of 
Father Claude Dablon's famous " Relation of the French- 
Canadian Mission " for the years 1676-77. It is a rare 
find, curiously coming to the surface on the tenth of 
March last, at the Messrs. Sotheby's auction rooms, in 
London. The publishing of the annual volume of "Jes- 
uit Relations " at Paris, was prohibited by Richelieu 
after 1672, and few thereafter found their way into 
print. In 1854, James Lenox for the first time printed 
this particular " Relation," edited by Dr. O'Callaghan; 
but they followed an abbreviated and modernized man- 
uscript copy at Laval University, Quebec. In 1861, it 
was again printed, at Paris, in Duniol's " Mission du 
Canada," but still in an imperfect form. The lucky 
finding of the original MS. now enables Mr. Thwaites 
to present this interesting document just as it was 
written.

IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS. 



Life of Roger Sherman. 

By LEWIS HEKRY BOUTELL. Crown 8vo, 361 pages, 

$2.00. 

" A timely and valuable contribution to the biographical 
literature of the country." The Nation. 

" Mr. Boutell has written a good piece of historical biog- 
raphy, and has brought out clearly the great services rendered 
to his state and nation by Roger Sherman. . . . The story is 
interestingly told, and may be relied upon as accurate and 
full." The Hartford Post. 



Eating and Drinking. 

By Dr. ALBERT H. HOY. 12mo, 304 pages, $1.50. 

Professor Albert H. Walker, author of " Text-Book of the 
Patent Laws of the U. S.," in a letter of a column and a half 
to the Hartford Times says, in part : "... It is the most 
profound and the most valuable, as well as the most clear ex- 
position of this subject which I ever saw or heard of ... and, 
desirous as I am at all times to do what I can toward extend- 
ing knowledge of good ideas, I am minded to write you about 
Dr. Hoy's most valuable book, and the theoretical and prac- 
tical science taught therein. 

" I forbear to expound Dr. Hoy's book further at this time ; 
but I would exhort all people who want to live long and be 
really happy while they do live, to buy or borrow a copy of 
that priceless book, and study it up as soon as possible." 



Italy in the Nineteenth Century. 

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. Illustrated. 8vo, 

$2.50. 

" It is the only single volume available in which the Amer- 
ican reader can find the whole of the elaborate web and woof

On the Red Staircase. 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR. 12mo, 352 pages, $1.25. 

The scene and time of this thrilling story are Moscow and 
the boyhood of Peter the Great. Much of the action takes 
place ON THE BED STAIRCASE in the palace of the Kremlin. 

"Another Zenda story ! " Chicago Times-Herald. 

" The hidden door, the dark passage, the abduction of the 
hero and heroine in turn, and the rescue of one by the other 
as occasion requires, are all laid along antique lines. Yet is is 
so admirably done, and the effect is so completely charming, 
that one wishes the lost art were more generally revived. 
After the many problem- novels and the myriad psychological 
disquisitions disguised as fiction, a wholesome, breezy tale like 
this, honestly and brilliantly told for its own sake, is a real 
treat, to be enjoyed without thought of criticism." The 
Bookman.

NEW BOOKS. 



The Wisdom of Fools. 

By MARGARET DEL AND, author of " John Ward, 
Preacher," "Sidney," "Philip and his Wife," 
"Mr. Tommy Dove," "The Old Garden, and 
Other Verses," etc. 16mo, $1.25. [April 24.} 
This book contains four stories, very modern, since 
they depict or assume conditions, tendencies, and prob- 
lems characteristic of society to-day. They are told with 
great vigor, and possess the well-known qualities of Mrs. 
Deland's style, which explain and justify the wide pop- 
ularity of her stories. 

Miss Archer Archer. 

By CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM, author of " The Wise 
Woman," "Sweet Clover," "The Mistress of 
Beech Knoll," " Next Door," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
[April 24.] 

Mrs. Burnham's large circle of readers will gladly 
welcome this new and thoroughly interesting story. The 
scene is partly on the coast of Maine, partly at an old 
" bef ore-the-war" homestead in Virginia. Some chapters 
take in Fortress Monroe, Hygeia Hotel, and Washington. 

The Day of his Youth. 

By ALICE BROWN, author of "Meadow Grass," 
" By Oak and Thorn," etc. 16mo, $1.00. 
A thoroughly interesting story, showing how a boy 
bred in the solitude of the woods developes into a noble 
manhood through the strong influence of love, through 
the suffering produced by treachery in love, and by un- 
selfish devotion to humanity. The story is told with 
much skill, and is very readable. 

The Young Mountaineers. 

Short Stories. By CHARLES EGBERT CRADDOCK 
(Mary N. Murfree), author of " In the Tennes- 
see Mountains," "The Prophet of the Great 
Smoky Mountains," etc. With Illustrations. 
12mo, $1.50. [May.] 

This book contains stories of adventure in the moun- 
tains of East Tennessee. They all have boys for heroes, 
and they are told in the vigorous, dramatic manner of 
other stories by the same author. 

The Open Mystery. 

A Reading of the Mosaic Story. By Mrs. A. D. T. 
WHITNEY, author of " Faith Gartney's Girl- 
hood," " Patience Strong's Outings," " The Gay- 
worthys," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
In this book Mrs. Whitney seeks to interpret the 
Pentateuch so as to enlist livelier and profounder inter- 
est in the Mosaic story. Back of simple narrative she 
finds deep and helpful suggestions for our daily life and 
stimulus to our wiser thought. She lends freshness to 
the legendary pages, and in her own skilful way " moral- 
izes the theme " so as to derive from the old story new 
inspiration and light for readers to-day.

addition to the glimpse it affords of the Temple City, the

it offers the choice of three distinct routes through the moun- 
tains and the most magnificent scenery in the world. On all 
Pacific Coast tourist tickets stop-overs are granted at Denver,

These Teachers' Bibles contain new Bible Helps, entitled "The Illustrated Bible 
Treasury," written by Leading Scholars in America and Great Britain. 

UPWARD OF 350 ILLUSTRATIONS 

of c/lncient {Monuments, Scenes in 'Bible Lands, Animals, "Plants, ^Antiquities , 
Coins, etc., etc., are distributed through the text of the Helps. 

"The new ' Illustrated Bible Treasury ' reaches the acme in the field of Bible 
students' helps. The catalogue of themes treated and the compactness and 
lucidity of the articles are a delight to the reader. The wealth of illustrations of 
the best sort not old worn-out cuts adds greatly to the beauty and complete- 
ness of the articles. The natural-history sections are especially fine in matter 
and make-up. The Concordance is the most complete yet produced, being 
adapted both to the Authorized and to the Revised Versions, and containing also 
proper names. We also find incorporated in it several themes which, in other 
helps, are found merely in separate sections under the dry uninteresting form of 
tables. Some of these are Messianic Prophecy, Parables in the Old Testament, 
Quotations in the New Testament for the Old. This feature simplifies the Bible 
student's task. The full dozen of new up-to-date maps, fully colored and 
indexed, are superb. ... Is nearest the ideal Bible student's manual of any pub- 
lication in its field-. "--The Dial. 

" A storehouse of great riches, indeed, is ' The Illustrated Bible Treasury/ 
edited by the Rev. Dr. William Wright. . . . The book will be of the greatest 
use to clergymen, and an invaluable aid to Sunday-school teachers. But the lay 
reader will find it most attractive, too. Many an hour of profitable and pleasant 
reading may be found in these pages."- -The Critic. 

"'The Illustrated Bible Treasury,' edited by William Wright, D.D., is one of 
the most valuable 'helps' to Bible study within our knowledge. . . . Such a 
publication as this attests not only the advance in Biblical scholarship, but the 
widespread interest there is in the Book of books. ... It has no superior . . .

But most of all he has shown the pity and the beauty of human

FOURTH EDITION 


PATIENCE SPARHAWK AND HER TIMES. By GERTRUDE 
ATHERTON. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
" However much this story may expose itself to the poisoned arrows 
of destructive criticism, it remains, when all is said and done, a 
remarkably fine novel. I confess that the story carried me along irre- 
sistibly. I do not think so adequate an exposition of the differing 
ferments and forces hi our modern American civilization has been 
made before. I am extremely grateful to Mrs. Atherton for what I 
consider one of the greatest novels of our time and one of the most 
vivid pictures of life as it is near the centre of our American mael- 
strom. ' Patience Sparhawk ' should interest the people of to-day. It 
is fascinating ; it is great art." Town Topics. 
" This book will be a success." JEANETTE D. GILDER in The Sun- 
day World. 


THE QUEST OF THE GOLDEN GIRL. By RICHARD LE 
GALLIENNE. With cover design by WILL BRADLEY. Crown 
8vo, $1.50. 
" Of the episodes, ' Aucasain and Nicolete ' is the most charming 
in a thoroughly decadent spirit, but when we come to ' Grace o' God,' 
we can hardly judge it dispassionately enough to criticise, so infinitely 
tender and personal is the note it strikes. For one who, gathering 
the best, may pass the evil unscathed, the book holds treasures." 
The Literary World. 
" In this airy book there are charming little bits of philosophy. . . . 
How many of us does not the following appeal to ? 'I blush to ad- 
mit it, my first love was a house-maid. ' But why the blush, if the 
girl was pretty ? . . . The young woman who wanted to go to bed in 
the dark, and put out the candle, but could n't put out the moon, is 
delightful, as are the chapters, ' How one makes love at Thirty,' and 
'How one plays the Hero at Thirty.' That seeing the world means 
seeing everything in it that ' most decent people won't look at ' is very 
true. The ' Venusberg of Piccadilly ' is a phrase that will sum up the 
recollection of that thoroughfare for all those who have known it 
between 11 and 12:30 at night. . . . This book is the most entertaining 
and best thing that Mr. Le Gallienne has done, and makes one forget 
the faults that have marred some of his other writings. Here they 
are conspicuous by their absence." If. Y. Evening Sun.

THE BATTLE OF THE BAYS. By OWEN SEAMAN. Flat 8vo,

The Dial, Chicago, says : " We read his little book from cover to 
cover with increasing delight. . . . For nearly a hundred delightful 
pages Mr. Seaman beguiles us with as ready a wit as these extracts 
exhibit." 
The New York Tribune says : " There is not a dull page in this book. 
We had almost said not a dull line. In its field, THE BATTLE or THE 
BATS will be a classic." 
Says The Chap Sook: "THE BATTLE OF THE BATS places him at 
one bound on the level of the very best of the lighter products of the 
English language. Most of his book is given over to a series of quite 
brilliant imitations of the various claimants for the laureateship. 
Whatever his subject, Mr. Seaman's delicate wit and absolute mas- 
tery over an easy conversational form of verse never fail him. THE 
BATTLE or THE BATS will give pleasure to everyone who reads it."

COPELAND AND DAY 

THE FALCON OF LANQEAC. By ISABEL WHITELY. Cloth, $1.50. 

Of its kind, "The Falcon of Lange"ac " is one of the strongest of a year of books. Boston Courier. 

Some of the best romantic works of to-day are from the pens of those writers who go to the distant past for their inspiration 
and ideas. Of this class of writers, they are the most successful when historical knowledge enables them to tell a simple tale 
in which human nature throbs strongly, and not pedantically, amid the glamour of by-gone days, when faith was strong, and 
life was painted in more glowing tales than it can be to-day. Such a story is " The Falcon of Lange*ac." It is more idyllic and 
sweet in character than a Hope tale. . . . The spirit of the Middle Age has rarely been better reflected in a story by a modern 
author. Worcester Daily Spy. 

LYRICS. By JOHN B. TABB. 3d Edition. Uniform with " Poems," now in its 6th edition. $1.00. 
Father Tabb's new book will not dissapoint the admirers of his " Poems." Many of the " Lyrics " are here published for 
the first time. All have the individuality, distinction, and charm that readers have learned to look for in the verse of the 
Maryland poet. 

A WRITER OF FICTION. By OLIVE HOLLAND, author of "My Japanese Wife." Cloth, $1.00. 

A psychologic study of a woman's conscience in regard to a posthumous novel written by her husband, the manuscripts and 
proof-sheets of which she heroically destroys to save his hitherto unblemished reputation. 

NEW POEMS. By FRANCIS THOMPSON. Cloth, $1.50. 

With one exception, the poems in this, Mr. Thompson's third volume, have hitherto been uncollected. The book is larger 
than its predecessors, and the work is of equal, if not superior, quality. It may be confidently predicted that its appearance 
will be one of the literary events of the season, in America and England. 

PATRINS. By LOUISE IMOGEN GUINEY. Cloth, $1.25. 

A number of short essays of a speculative and whimsical nature, on disconnected subjects. An extract from the dedication 
(to Mr. Bliss Carman) explains the curious title. " A patrin, according to George Borrow, in ' Romano Lavo-Lil,' is ' a Gypsy 
trail, handfuls of leaves or grass cast by the Gypsies on the road to denote to those behind the way which they have taken.' " 

IN TITIAN'S GARDEN. By HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD. Cloth, $1.25. 

The poems here gathered are eminently representative of the author's genius. To many readers they will recall and jus- 
tify the cordial words with which Mr. Stedman greeted one of Mrs. Spofford's earlier works. 

No. VI. OATEN STOP SERIES: THE HEART OF LIFE. By JAMES BUCKHAM. Paper boards, 75c. 

Under the sub- titles, ' ' Out of the City ' ' and ' 'With Men and Women, ' ' Mr. Bnckham brings together poems which, whether 
dealing with nature or humanity, are notable for insight, sympathy, and felicity of expression.

" Even if this volume were devoid of illustrations, and depended en- 
tirely on its letterpress for success, it would be welcomed as an addition 
to English literature. It is more than an accurate and comprehensive 
description of all the birds one is likely to find in an extended search. 
It is also an introduction to them and their haunts, so enticingly written 
that the reader at once falls in love with them and becomes an enthusi-

THE FRIENDSHIP OF NATURE. 

A New England Chronicle of Birds and Flowers. Second

" A dainty little volume, exhaling the perfume and radiating the hues 
of both cultivated and wild flowers, echoing the songs of birds, and illus- 
trated with exquisite pen-pictures of bits of garden, field, and woodland 
scenery. The author is an intimate of nature. She relishes its beauties 
with the keenest delight, and describes them with a musical flow of lan- 
guage that carries us along from a ' Hay day ' to ' a winter mood ' in a 
thoroughly sustained effort." The Richmond Ditpatch. 



TOMMY-ANNE AND THE THREE HEARTS. 

Illustrated by ALBERT D. BLASHFIELD. IGmo, cloth; price, $1.50. 

" The book is calculated to interest children in nature, and grown folks, too, will find themselves catching the author's enthusiasm. Ae for 
Tommy- Anne herself, she is bound to make friends wherever she is known. The more of such books as these, the better for the children. One 
' Tommy- Anne ' is worth a whole shelf of the average juvenile literature." The Critic. 

" No child who enjoys the familiar things of nature will be disappointed in Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright's ' Tommy- Anne and the Three Hearts.' 
The work is probably the most charming nature-book for children published this year." The Dial. 

"This book is altogether out of the commonplace. It will be immensely entertaining to all children who have a touch of imagination, and 
it is instructive and attractive to older readers as well." The Outlook.

to its affiliated secondary schools for supplementary reading. 

"One of the most delightful semi-scientific books which everyone 
enjoys reading and at once wishes to own. Such works present science 
in the most fascinating and enticing way, and from a cursory glance at 
paragraphs the reader is insensibly led on. ... The work is especially 
well adapted for school purposes in connection with the study of ele-

THE CHICAGO ORCHESTRA. 

The Chicago Orchestra, under the leadership 
of Mr. Theodore Thomas, has just ended the 
sixth season of its work, and the occasion seems 
to call for a few statements of fact, as well as 
for a few comments upon the significance of the 
organization for the city in which it has found 
a home. For six years now, the music-loving 
population of Chicago has been in the enjoy- 
ment of weekly concerts given by this unex- 
celled body of musicians, each programme 
receiving both an afternoon and an evening 
performance, and the steady increase of receipts 
from year to year has given evidence of the 
growing hold of the Orchestra upon the public. 
In addition to its own proper work, the Or- 
chestra has been the means of providing a 
suitable setting for the work of a great array of 
distinguished artists, both vocal and instru- 
mental, who have been inspired to their best 
efforts by its sympathetic and finished accom- 
paniment. It has also served to reenforce the 
work of the most important choral organization 
of the city, and to join forces with the visiting 
companies of grand opera, making possible 
performances of a character unequalled else- 
where in the United States. During the season 
just ended, it has organized and trained a spe- 
cial auxiliary chorus of its own, whose work 
thus far accomplished is full of promise for the 
future. It has also, by means of its occasional 
tours in neighboring states, brought musical 
opportunities of the highest character within 
the reach of many communities that could not 
otherwise have hoped to hear adequate perform- 
ances of the great orchestral masterpieces. 

Until recently, the public in general has 
been but imperfectly informed of the means 
whereby this superb musical organization has 
been enabled to carry on its work for the past 
six years. It has been known in a general way 
that the Orchestra was far from self-supporting, 
and that the liberality of a small body of public- 
spirited citizens has alone made its work pos- 
sible. A financial statement just published by 
the trustees of the Orchestral Association gives 
for the first time a series of definite statements 
upon this subject, and tells the city how much 
it owes to the men who have so nobly carried 
on the enterprise. It appears that the annual 



270 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



deficit, which was more than fifty thousand 
dollars for the first year, has steadily dimin- 
ished until it now amounts to about half of that 
sum. In other words, the guarantors (a body 
of men numbering fifty or less) have contrib- 
uted something like a quarter of a million of 
dollars during the six years, or what has been, 
roughly speaking, from one-third to one-fifth 
of the annual cost of the work. This great 
gift to the interests of culture has been made 
without ostentation, by men whose hearts were 
in the work to be done, and who have sought 
no recognition for their public-spirited en- 
deavor. Its importance deserves for this rea- 
son to be emphasized all the more, and the 
public can not honor too highly the men who 
have found so worthy an object for their ex- 
penditure, and who have maintained this mu- 
sical enterprise upon so high a plane of artistic 
excellence. 

For the most satisfactory thing about the 
whole six years' work, when viewed in general 
retrospect, has been its entire freedom from 
any attempt to win the applause of the multi- 
tude by concessions to vulgar prejudice or mere- 
tricious tastes. Unmindful of popular clamor, 
which has often been voiced in an ignorant 
way, and sometimes in a purely malignant way, 
by the more hopeless of the city newspapers, 
the trustees and director of the Orchestra have 
set themselves the highest possible standard for 
their work, and have persistently refused to 
derogate from a lofty ideal. The two leading 
aims have been to present the greatest musical 
works in the best possible way, and to give 
encouragement to new talent, European and 
American, by a generous production of the lat- 
est compositions. Many a time, doubtless, when 
a more popular selection of numbers would have 
filled the vast hall, the performance has found 
but a slender audience because the programme 
announced only works by men whose names 
seemed to the public either unknown or forbid- 
ding. The average Philistine resents being 
told that his own likings have nothing to do 
with the matter, that such and such works are 
the ones best for him to hear, and that if his 
self-sufficiency scorn the opportunity offered, 
he is not to be flattered by a descent to the level 
of his unformed tastes, but rather left to his 
own devices. 

Work done in this spirit often seems thank- 
less, and its reward is likely to be long-delayed. 
Yet it is the only spirit in which really worthy 
work may be done for popular culture, whether 
in music, literature, art, or education. " This 



masterpiece deserves your attention," we should 
say, " for it has the power to raise you to a 
higher spiritual level. If you do not like it now, 
pray that you may learn to like it, for the de- 
fect is yours, and we should do you but poor 
service in seeking to attract you by inferior 
things." He who takes this attitude has to 
contend against powerful odds ; all the forces 
of stagnant indolence, and ignorant self-asser- 
tion, and petty pride, and unreasoning preju- 
dice are arrayed against him, and the endeavor 
to help men in spite of themselves is of all 
forms of endeavor the most certain to be mis- 
understood. It requires strong convictions and 
unusual tenacity of purpose to live up to such 
an ideal. The educator, for example, finds it 
hard to resist the pressure of subjects that he 
knows should not invade the curriculum be- 
cause he knows that they offer but an inferior 
means of discipline ; the librarian finds it hard 
to refuse people the books that they want 
because he knows that they are not worth read- 
ing ; the literary critic gets small thanks for 
his insistence upon true literary values and 
his uncompromising maintenance of absolute 
standards ; the musician who would give the 
public only the best work too often finds that 
the public has no appreciation of the gift, and 
is clamorous only for work that is shallow or 
inane. 

It is not easy to form an adequate conception 
of the value to the public of such a service as 
has been performed by the Chicago Orchestra. 
The ministry of every form of fine art is elu- 
sive, and of none more so than of music. There 
are many estimable persons who would deny it 
any part in the development of culture or the 
shaping of character, considering it merely as 
a means of amusement, a titillation of the au- 
ditory sense, a recreation in the popular but 
not the real acceptation of the term. Non 
ragionam di lor. Their philanthropic endeavor 
will properly find exercise in charities of the 
material sort, in caring for the sick, feeding 
the hungry, and clothing the needy. But the 
life is, after all, we are told upon excellent 
authority, more than meat, and music is of 
all the arts that which contributes most imme-

THE DETERIORATION OF COLLEGE 
ENGLISH. 

Quintilian, the great Roman educator of the first 
century, regarded the power of speech as a divine 
gift, entailing upon its recipient the moral obliga- 
tion of careful use. It is true that one may pick out 
occasional blemishes in his fulfilment of this obliga- 
tion ; but that his ideal was a beneficent force in 
the development of his style, and in his influence 
over his pupils, cannot be questioned. 

To pass over eighteen centuries at a bound, it is 
worthy of consideration whether the teaching of 
English to-day is not hampered by the lack of some 
such noble point of view. We say " hampered " 
advisedly, for a deficiency may easily have just such 
an effect as a positive encumbrance. Anyone who 
is at all acquainted with the college life of to-day 
knows that it is permeated, not simply with a lack 
of care as to the correct use of language, but also 
with the habit of taking the most grotesque liber- 
ties in its morphology, phonetics, syntax, and mean- 
ing, for no more adequate reason than the supposi- 
tion that such linguistic butchery is humorous. 
There are very few college periodicals in which the 
influence of both these elements is not prominent, 
notwithstanding the fact that many colleges allow 
work on the college paper to count as a substitute 
for a portion of the work of the English Depart- 
ment. 

Now it is utterly impossible that such loose habits 
of speech indulged in constantly during student life 
should have no permanently deleterious effect upon 
the speech of after days. We may as well look for 
the average youthful spendthrift to take his place 
among careful and successful men of business as for 
the student who habitually mangles his language 
during his college days, just for the fun of it, to 
become a graceful writer or speaker. There might 
be some mitigation if these same students were in 
the habit of spending their spare hours in the 
thoughtful reading of the great literary masterpieces 
of our own and other tongues ; but it must be ad- 
mitted that this kind of reading is not very gener- 
ally in vogue among American colleges of the pres- 
ent day. With the improved systems of cataloguing 
now in use, it is true that most college libraries are 
issuing more books than ever before, but there is 
here no evidence that thoughtful students of lin- 
guistic expression are increasing in numbers. The 
prevalent haste that is rendering thorough work 



impossible in all other walks of life has unfortu- 
nately made its way into our colleges and universi- 
ties. An Eastern professor can in these latter days 
describe the kind of psychological training which 
he advocates as that which will enable the student 
to " get there "; and on all sides the cry is heard 
for shorter paths to college honors paths which 
can be trod only at the sacrifice of much that should 
be inseparable from the idea of liberal education. 
And even when there is no attempt to shorten the 
period of college residence, it is none the less true 
that a shortening of the portion of this time which 
can be given to reading is rendered inevitable by 
the excessive multiplication of college organizations, 
a tendency which has gone so far in many col- 
leges that organization falls little short of disinte- 
gration. With so many outside calls upon his time, 
even the well-meaning student often finds himself 
hunting for spare hours in which to "get his les- 
sons," and does less collateral reading during his 
whole course than should be compassed in a single 
year. 

All these disadvantageous circumstances can be 
overcome only by influences of immense strength in 
the opposite direction ; and it is well worth consider- 
ing whether a sine qua non among such influences be 
not the assiduous cultivation of a wholesome respect 
for correct and graceful expression as such. We 
have little respect for the man who from mere lack 
of effort remains a life-long bungler with the tools 
of manual labor, but we are all too lenient with 
him who remains unnecessarily a bungler with the 
delicate tool for the expression of thought. Can 
there not be a general determination among, not 
merely the teachers of language, but all who think 
accuracy and grace in the use of language a boon 
worth striving for to secure for this acquirement a 
higher place in the public esteem than it now occu- 
pies? Genius is proverbially hard to tether, but 
even the man of genius should be made to feel the 
critic's lash when he indulges in slovenly expression, 
or in any other faults of expression which a reason- 
able caution would avoid. If one's claim to genius 
be in any way bound up with language which would 
be simply carelessness^ of expression in another, 
then it is a claim the validity of which will bear 
investigation. 

There is one source of linguistic deterioration in 
our colleges which it takes some temerity to men- 
tion, and yet it deserves notice, that is, the prac- 
tical working of the modern elective system. Under 
older methods the study of a few models of literary 
expression, even if only in foreign tongues, was an 
absolute requisite to college honors. Now nothing 
of the kind is true. Entering with no Greek, and 
with not enough Latin to have reached the point 
where an appreciation of literary excellence is pos- 
sible, the student in some of our most famous schools 
may pursue a course which will bring him into con- 
tact with polite letters at no single point, and grad- 
uate with the same honor as any other. Colonel

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



Higginson has recently told us of a Harvard Pro- 
fessor (name omitted) who stopped him in the street 
to inquire who Charles Brockden Brown was, and 
of a Harvard Senior seeking for a lecturer before 
some society, and obliged to confess that he had 
never heard the name of John Fiske. Now if free 
election may legitimately follow paths which will 
allow the elector to escape even a hint of the exist- 
ence of Charles Brockden Brown or John Fiske, are 
we to throw stones at him who elects a course which 
will not bring him into contact with such points as 
the propriety of avoiding split infinitives and the 
various other offenses against good taste which need 
no enumeration here? And then, too, as professor- 
ships in this and that specialty multiply, the new 
chairs in the faculty circle will often be filled by 
graduates who began their specialization at so early 
a date as not to come into contact with any of the 
departments of instruction which can fairly be called 
upon to look carefully after the student's habits of 
expression. The inevitable result is a faculty not 
at all in harmony as to the inherent importance of 
the niceties of verbal expression. This lack of uni- 
formity in standard has its positive influence for bad 
on the speech of students who come under such a 
faculty, and indirectly it deprives them of much of 
the good influence which a portion of the faculty 
might otherwise exert ; for one feels a natural hesi- 
tation about passing a severe sentence of condemna- 
tion upon language which may be heard from the 
lips of a colleague before the day is over. 

With such conditions, it is not altogether strange 
that the offer of a good prize failed to bring to 
the editor of the " Bachelor of Arts " a story from 
an undergraduate of sufficient merit to justify the 
award. But let not the editor be too severe in his 
conclusions ; has not an editorial department of his 
own magazine startled all old-fashioned Bachelors 
of Arts with such a hash of Greek and Latin as " hoi 

populoi"? _ TT T

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE MAGAZINES AND NEW TALENT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The prevailing flatness and sameness of American 
literature is due in great measure to the influence of the 
magazines. If any young writer can get his work 
printed in the magazines, he cannot afford to publish 
elsewhere, except as an afterthought; and hence in style 
and substance he is apt to be controlled by the ideals of 
the magazine editors. These ideals are purely com- 
mercial. 

The magazine editor serves a firm and handles the 
money of others. A single mistake may mean a damage 
of thousands of dollars. The appearance of an unpop- 
ular article or an unpleasing phrase may alienate a pub- 
lic; not only a reading public, but an advertising public. 
Hence the flatness of the magazines. 

What the business man dreads is risk. A publisher is 



a business man, and all novelty represents risk. When 
a magazine has established a circulation, the only safe 
thing to do is to keep on reprinting the same number. 
If this point has been reached in the progress of a mag- 
azine, it is marked by the appearance in the stationery 
of the editorial office of the phrase " policy of the maga- 
zine." 

A magazine ought to have no policy except the policy 
of discovering and publishing the live thoughts of living 
men and women, and the editor in printing or rejecting 
ought to be governed by his own personal feelings, his 
good sense, his taste, his beliefs. 

The other day I wrote an article on a popular author. 
It was quite short. In order to find out what it was like, 
I showed it to half a dozen intelligent people. They 
thought it well-written and entertaining. The article is 
now in process of being rejected by all the leading maga- 
zines. The real reason of its rejection is that it repre- 
sents a slightly novel view of a very popular writer: each 
magazine is afraid that some portion of the public will 
pick up the number, glance at it, see an unsympathetic 
view of a favorite writer, and throw down the copy. 
The forms of rejection are different, but the substance 
is the same. 

Now note the point: I am perhaps thirty-five years 
old. I believe I know the rank and value of such arti- 
cles as I turn out. They are secondary work of an intel- 
ligent sort. I know, too, that by consulting certain 
people I can make sure of just how much any article 
amounts to before publishing it. I have money enough 
to live on. I have a contempt for the magazines. It 
may be that rejection means encouragement. But take 
the case of a boy of twenty-one, and let us imagine a 
boy of genius who out of the blood of his heart writes 
something. He himself is no judge of its merits. He 
only knows he thinks it true. He does not even know 
how to find out whether his article is good. He has a 
narrow acquaintance among persons whose opinions 
might stead him much, and he needs money. He sends 
his work to a magazine. The better the work is, the 
more real and vital and novel it is, the more certainly 
will it represent risk. He receives it back, and begins 
to collect notes of rejection. The worst of this is that 
these rejections represent not only discouragement to 
him, they represent criticism. He begins to mistrust 
his own work. For a time he starves. Then it occurs 
to him that if he wants to get his work printed, he must 
provide some magazine with the material which that 
magazine is printing. Upon trial, he finds this not so 
difficult; and this is the beginning of the end for that 
young man. 

Let us now imagine a writer to get past this first 
barrier. He writes a good story and has it printed. It 
turns out a success, and his name and work are in de- 
mand. One would think that the writer was now a 
made man. And so he is, but on condition. He must 
write on the subject or in the manner of his first effort. 
He may turn out replicas for the next ten years, and 
can sell them all; but his venture in any new field will 
represent risk as before; and the business pressure will 
begin to fall exactly upon his own weakest point. Inertia, 
self-esteem, and expediency, all prompt him to content 
himself with his old style. The work done by a man 
under these circumstances is very different from the 
work done in creating his first masterpiece. He strug- 
gles to reproduce his success, to keep his audience. He 
is paying for his advancement in coin much like that of 
his weaker neighbor.

Hence the daily destruction of talent, on the one side 
by starvation, on the other side by success; and hence 
also the general tone and character of our magazines. 

It is not to be expected that any improvement will 
take place except upon the realization by the magazines 
of a new commercial interest. If the public is now well 
served, and gets what it really wants, the case is hopeless.

THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL 

IN THE WEST. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wish to add my word of cordial endorsement of the 
article on " The Preservation of Historical Material in 
the Middle West," in THE DIAL of April 16. I wish 
it were possible to place Professor Sparks's admirable 
article within the easy reach of every intelligent and 
thoughtful citizen in the land. For the significance of 
his contention cannot be overrated. He correctly says 
that much historical material is disappearing from hu- 
man view forever, the loss of which will be a serious 
one not only to the student of history, but to the country 
and the world. This material cannot, in many instances, 
be duplicated. Once destroyed, there is often nothing 
left of the facts but conjecture and tradition. Professor 
Sparks is quite right, therefore, in urging the generation 
of to-day to place such historical material as it may 
possess at the disposal of trustees of public libraries, 
historical societies, museums, and the like, so that this 
valuable matter may be accessible to the generations 
that are to follow. 

I have thought that an excellent way to stimulate 
original historical research in the West might be to pur- 
sue some such plan as is adopted in the Eastern colleges 
with reference to their admirable series of " historical 
studies." Perhaps there are a few lesser Rockefellers 
in the great and growing West who would offer some 
substantial encouragement for such investigations. I 
feel sure that there are students of Western history and 
Western life who are ready to engage in the laudable 
undertaking. DUANE MOWRY.

A GOOD EXAMPLE FROM KANSAS. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

Having read with much interest Professor Sparks's 
article on " The Preservation of Historical Material in 
the Middle West," in your last issue, I intrude on your 
valuable space only to call attention to the splendid 
example afforded by one Western State. The Kansas 
State Historical Society, located at the State Capitol in 
Topeka, is peculiarly rich in just such materials as Mr. 
Sparks refers to. The society has been very fortunate 
in its secretary, Mr. Frank G. Adams, to whom his work 
has in verity been a grateful " labor of love." I doubt 
if there is a richer mine of contemporaneous historical 
material in any other State of the Union than has been 
collected largely by his efforts. The history of Kansas 
has been made within the memory of our older genera- 
tion; and Secretary Adams, who was himself an active 
participant in those stirring events and struggles, has 
labored unceasingly to make the records of them com- 
plete, and to preserve every scrap of pioneer and per- 
sonal data. The collection is peculiarly rich in its news- 
paper files, pamphlets, and manuscripts; especially is it 



full on everything relating to anti-slavery affairs, while 
its John Brown collection is unique and almost complete. 
It has become a matter of personal pride on the part of 
old residents of Kansas, like myself, to send all their 
historical material to Topeka; and this has by no means 
been confined to the " abolition " side of the State's his- 
tory. The society has also a valuable collection relating 
to the New West. RICHARD J. HINTON.

A DISPUTED ARCHAISM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It has long seemed to me that there is something 
more than an " archaism " in the widespread disposition 
to use the word " learn " for " teach." 

When the rustic brings " young hopeful " to the pro- 
fessor with the proposition to " learn " him algebra, he 
means something more than teach; he means, Can you 
make him learn ? Can you teach him so that he will 
learn ? 

In a word, if I am right in my recollection of the 
Greek, the usage is a survival of the " middle voice.'*

A UCASSIN ET NICOLETE. 



Sweet his lady, fair of face, 
From the turret to the ground 

In a moment's breathless space 
Glad escape has found. 

Swift she takes her wilful way 

Past the blossoms drenched in dew; 

(What if Aucassin were I 
Nicolete were you!) 

Fair white daisies 'gainst her feet 
Show less white, less pure than they; 

Through the shadowy moonlit street 
Love has found a way. 

To the dungeon deep and chill 
Comes she where her lover lies, 

And the air is all athrill 
With his passion-cries. 

Sharp and bright her dagger gleams, 

As she cuts her yellow hair; 
Throws it him who oft in dreams 

Kissed and called it fair; 

Whispers, ere she turns to fly, 
All the old words, dear and true; 

(Ah, that Aucassin were I 
Nicolete were you!) 

What is left to us to-day 

From that simple elder time ? 

Just the half-forgotten way 
Of a captive's rhyme. 

Yet it breathes of courage high, 
Strong Love, swift to dare and do; 

(Ah, that Aucassin were I ! 
Nicolete were you!)

SOME AMERICAN HISTORY REWRITTEN.* 



In his work entitled "The Middle Period, 
1817-1858," Professor Burgess confines him- 
self to the political history of the United States 
during the period covered by his plan. The 
burden of his task is slavery ; but of course he 
deals with the related questions which group 
themselves about it, including the acquisition of 
Florida and our Seminole wars, the admission 
of Missouri, the tariff issue and internal im- 
provements, the bank question and the sub- 
treasury, nullification and the rise of abolition- 
ism, the annexation of Texas and the Oregon 
question, the war with Mexico and the Com- 
promise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Law and 
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and 
the struggle in Kansas and the Dred Scott 
decision. These are old questions, about which 
history has had much to say in the form of 
detailed narrative ; but we believe that never 
before have they been so clearly presented for 
the use of the general reader as in the well- 
written and compact pages of this volume. 

The author says in his preface : 

" The continued misunderstanding between the North 
and the South is an ever-present menace to the welfare 
of both sections and of the entire nation. It makes it 
almost impossible to decide any question of our politics 
upon its merits. It offers an almost insuperable obstacle 
to the development of a national opinion upon the funda- 
mental principles of our polity. If we would clear up 
this confusion in the common consciousness, we must 
do something to dispel this misunderstanding; and I 
know of no means of accomplishing this, save the re- 
writing of our history from 1816 to 1860, with an open 
mind and a willing spirit to see and to represent truth 
and error, and right and wrong, without regard to the 
men or the sections in whom or where they may appear." 

This breathes the right spirit, and doubtless 
expresses the sincere purpose of the writer 
touching the task before him. But he acknowl- 
edges its difficulties and freely confesses his 
" many misgivings " as to its performance. 
His self-distrust is quite natural, and evidently 
precludes the hope of complete success. Our 
first occasion for criticism is found on page 27, 
where Professor Burgess refers to the Seminole 
Indians, and the destruction of what has been 
known as Blount's Fort, on the Appalachicola 
river. This fort had been erected by Great 
Britain during the War of 1812, when Florida 
belonged to England, and was intended for

ner's Sons. 



offensive and defensive purposes by the negroes 
and Indians who occupied that region ; and 
after the close of the war Colonel Nichols, who 
had been in command of it, left it in the posses- 
sion of these people. Professor Burgess says : 
" Professor Von Hoist, in his great work, has desig- 
nated the expedition against the Nichols Fort as a hunt 
by the United States army for fugitive slaves. He does 
not seem to have recognized the danger to the peace 
and civilization of the United States of the growth of a 
community of pirates and buccaneers upon its borders. It 
does not appear to have occurred to him that the most 
humane attitude towards the slaves of Georgia may have 
been to prevent them from being drawn into any such 
connection. He does not seem to have comprehended 
that any public interest was subserved by disposing of 
the negroes captured in this expedition in such a way as 
to prevent any future attempts on their part at coopera- 
tion with the Indians in their barbarous warfare upon 
the frontiers of the United States. In a sentence, he 
seems to have regarded the entire incident as a prosti- 
tution of the military power of the United States to the 
private greed of slave-hunters, and to have discovered 
in it a most convincing proof of the canting hypocrisy 
of the free republic. In view of all the facts of the 
case, this certainly appears to be a very crude apprecia- 
tion of the subject. This same historian calls the attack 
upon the Nichols Fort the beginning of the Seminole 
War." 

These are remarkable statements. Professor 
Burgess speaks of the people in this fort as 
" pirates and buccaneers." It is always easy 
to call names, but history should deal with facts. 
There were three hundred and thirty-four per- 
sons in the fort, all or nearly all of whom were 
fugitive slaves or the descendants of slaves who 
had escaped from their masters during two or 
three preceding generations. They were citizens 
and subjects of the crown of Spain, and as free 
as the fugitive slaves who had found protection 
under the British flag in Canada. They were 
cultivating their lands and occupying their 
homes in that section of Florida, and were en- 
titled to all the rights of Spanish citizens. Of 
course the presence of such a body of fugitives 
was disagreeable to the slaveholders, and tended 
to weaken their title to this peculiar form of 
property ; but the fugitives could not justly be 
blamed for exercising the right to run away, 
nor was the general government under the 
least obligation to assist their masters in their 
recovery. Professor Burgess complains that 
Dr. Von Hoist designates this expedition 
against the Nichols Fort as " a hunt by the 
United States army for fugitive slaves." This 
is exactly what it was, and the order of General 
Jackson was to " blow up the fort and return 
the negroes to their rightful owners." Dr. Von 
Hoist was right, therefore, in regarding it as 
" a prostitution of the military power of the

United States to the private greed of slave- 
hunters," while he was also right in asserting 
that the attack upon this fort, which was sixty 
miles from United States territory, was the 
beginning of the first Seminole War. In this 
statement he is supported by Hildreth and 
other trustworthy authorities. We believe no 
fact is better established than that both of our 
Florida wars were organized military slave- 
hunts, during the progress of which the author- 
ities of the government offered a bounty of 
twenty dollars for each slave captured, while 
the bloodhounds which the government im- 
ported from Cuba were not employed in the 
capture of Indians, but of slaves. In the light 
of these facts, the reader can form his own 
opinion of the bombarding of this fort by red- 
hot shot which instantly killed two hundred 
and seventy men, women, and children, who 
were torn and mangled beyond description ; 
while of the sixty who remained, only three 
escaped unhurt. We add, as a further contri- 
bution to the truth of history, that twenty-odd 
years afterwards Congress appropriated five 
thousand dollars as the reward of the officers 
and men who perpetrated this wholesale work 
of rapine and murder. If " the development of 
a national opinion upon the fundamental prin- 
ciples of our national polity " has become neces- 
sary, as Professor Burgess insists, we respect- 
fully submit that " the re-writing " of our 
political history will have to be done after a 
different fashion, and that it will necessarily 
include some adequate account of our wars with 
the Seminole Indians and the shocking sub- 
serviance of the national government to the 
interests of slavery. 

In referring to the mobbing of Abolitionists 
in the North and the insurrection of Nat Turner 
in Virginia, Professor Burgess says (p. 250) : 

" Only one person, the Rev. Mr. Lovejoy, was killed 
in these [Northern] collisions; that this happened under 
circumstances of some aggravation; and that, if the ex- 
citement at the South over the massacre of sixty-one 
innocent persons was out of proportion with the event, 
then not too much should be made out of the killing of 
a single person, who was not entirely guiltless on his 
part of giving provocation." 

We think the fling at Mr. Lovejoy contained 
in this passage is unwarranted. He was a min- 
ister of the gospel and the editor of a religious 
newspaper. He was not a politician or the 
champion of any party. He was not in the fel- 
lowship of the Abolitionists, and criticised their 
methods. He disclaimed any right to meddle 
with slavery, either by legislation or physical 
violence. His newspaper only dealt with the 



question incidentally, and always with modera- 
tion and good temper. When he found he 
could not do this in Missouri, and was driven 
into a free State, the barbarism of slavery fol- 
lowed him, and he was put to death, solely be- 
cause he refused to surrender the right of free- 
speech at the bidding of the mob. These are 
the simple facts of his heroic career, and his- 
tory should not attempt to palliate the crime of 
his murderers by the pitiful plea that he pro- 
voked it. 

Speaking of our war with Mexico (pp. 330, 
331), Professor Burgess says : 

" Some of the Whigs claimed that if war existed at all, 
it was offensive war, and that the President had exceeded 
his constitutional powers in bringing it on, and should be 
impeached for so doing. The truth of this proposition 
depended, of course, upon the recognition by the United 
States of Mexico's title to the territory between the Rio 
Grande and the Nueces, or at least upon the recognition 
of it as a free zone, a proposition difficult to reconcile with 
the acts of Congress annexing Texas, and extending the 
laws of the United States over this very district. The 
fact is, it was a defensive war at the outset, and if the 
Mexicans were excited to their move across the Rio 
Grande by the appearance of United States troops on 
the northern bank, they had only to thank themselves 
for bringing them there by previously massing their 
troops on the south bank. Of course the abolitionists 
could see nothing in the matter but a wicked scheme 
for the extension of slavery. Their attitude was, how- 
ever, too narrow and bigoted to win much attention." 

In a serious historical undertaking, written 
" with an open mind and a willing spirit to see 
and to represent truth and error," these state- 
ments are surprising. It was not " some of the 
Whigs," but all of the Northern Whigs, who 
believed that the war was one of aggression and 
conquest, although they lacked the courage to 
vote their convictions. In this, both Calhoun 
and Benton agreed with them, and the latter 
demonstrated that the country between the 
Nueces and the Rio Grande, about one hundred 
miles wide and two thousand miles long, be- 
longed to Mexico. The United States in annex- 
ing Texas had expressly reserved the right to 
determine her disputed boundaries, and this 
certainly could not be done by an order of the 
President commanding General Taylor to begin 
offensive operations a hundred miles beyond 
the boundaries of the United States. As to the 
bill extending the revenue laws of the United 
States over a portion of the territory claimed 
by Texas, Professor Burgess must be aware 
that it was smuggled through Congress by a 
trick, and was never recognized by Mexico. 
We did not suppose that any respectable writer 
of our political history would at this day defend 
the executive falsehood of President Polk in 



276 



THE DIAL 



[May 1 



declaring that " American blood has been shed 
on American soil," or the parallel falsehood of 
Congress that " by the act of the Republic of 
Mexico a state of war exists between that gov- 
ernment and the United States." The con- 
temptuous reference of Professor Burgess to 
the Abolitionists is not less remarkable. He 
says they " could see nothing in the war but 
a wicked scheme for the extension of slavery," 
but that their attitude was " too narrow and 
bigoted to win much attention." That the ani- 
mating purpose of the war was the extension of 
slavery, nobody will now dispute ; and intelli- 
gent men of all parties so understood it at the 
time, while history has abundantly shown that 
the " attitude " of the Abolitionists on this 
question did finally " win much attention." 

In speaking of the Brooks assault upon Sum- 
ner (p. 439), Professor Burgess speaks of 
Senator Butler of South Carolina as " a gentle- 
man of great refinement and politeness," and 
pronounces Sumner's speech in reply to him 
" especially coarse and brutal." He says : 

"Senator Butler was in ill health, and was absent 
from his seat, both of which circumstances made the 
affair all the more exasperating. For two days the Cap- 
itol rang with denunciations of the insulting speech, 
when Preston S. Brooks, a nephew of Senator Butler 
and a member of the House of Representatives, de- 
manded and took satisfaction of Mr. Sumner for the 
attack upon his kinsman. Had he carried out his pur- 
pose in a brave and manly way, he would have been 
generally applauded for it; but being a small, weak 
man physically, while Sumner was a powerful athlete, 
Brooks had recourse to a method which stamped him as 
a coward, and his attack upon Sumner as a brutal out- 
rage." 

We think this is entirely too gingerly. Sen- 
ator Butler was by no means a saintly charac- 
ter, but an irascible representative of Southern 
chivalry, who had already given Mr. Sumner 
adequate occasion for what he said, and who, 
in the debate which followed this assault, called 
Senator Wilson a liar. It is true that Senator 
Butler was absent from his seat, but he knew 
before he left for his home that Sumner was to 
speak on this day, and that he was under no 
obligation to postpone the time of his speaking 
on this account. Professor Burgess speaks of 
Brooks as a nephew of Senator Butler ; but he 
was in fact only the son of Butler's cousin. He 
says if Brooks had " carried out his purpose in 
a brave and manly way, he would have been 
generally applauded for it ; but being a small, 
weak man physically, while Sumner was a pow- 
erful athlete, Brooks had recourse to a method 
which stamped him as a coward," etc. Brooks 
was over six feet in height, strongly built, and 



in the prime of life, so that this poor excuse 
fails him ; while the statement that if he had 
chastised Sumner in a brave and manly way he 
would have been generally applauded is a re- 
markable one, for Sumner had kept himself 
strictly within the rules of parliamentary de- 
corum, and thus left his enemies without any 
excuse for an appeal to violence, although they 
had singled him out for months before for their 
special venom and personal vituperation. It is 
true that Sumner's words were winged with 
power, because he told the naked truth and 
made no attempt to " nullify damnation with 
a phrase." But he was neither " coarse " nor 
" brutal " in his diction. He saw that the slave- 
masters had united in the resolve to crush him, 
and he felt that the time had gone by for the 
policy of conciliation and concession, or any 
form or degree of surrender to brow-beating 
and threats. He therefore offered them his 
defiance ; and the nation to-day owes him its 
unbounded thanks for his blasting assault upon 
slavery, which was made necessary by the habit 
of submission to its demands and the growing 
audacity of its pretensions. 

Professor Burgess refers (p. 440) to the 
frightful slaughter of five men by John Brown 
and his associates on Pottawattomie creek in 
Kansas, and says : " No sane man can find the 
slightest justification, excuse, or palliation for 
this atrocious crime. It was murder, pure and 
simple." And he brands them as " cutthroats 
and highwaymen." This sweeping and unqual- 
ified statement will be questioned by many. 
Brown was a sincere and intense hater of slavery. 
He regarded the repeal of the Missouri Com- 
promise as a conspiracy to nationalize and per- 
petuate the evil in the United States. He saw 
the border ruffians of Missouri rushing into 
Kansas in armed hordes, and by fraud and 
force seeking to legalize slavery there, while 
the administration at Washington was giving 
them aid and comfort. Several of his own 
family had fallen in this fearful conflict, in 
which the border ruffians were seeking to ter- 
rorize the free-state men into submission. These 
were certainly palliating facts. It seemed to 
him that the nation was asleep, and he finally 
persuaded himself that divine Providence had 
chosen him to be the special avenger of unright- 
eousness. Both in Kansas and afterwards in 
Virginia he showed himself to be a man with- 
out fear and without self-reproach, and that he 
gloried in the consciousness of having become 
the instrument of the Most High in giving 
liberty to the slave. The propriety of classify-

ing such a character with ordinary " cutthroats 
and highwaymen " is not apparent ; but we 
agree with Professor Burgess when he says : 

"It is a source of congratulation that the juristic 
sense of the last decades of the nineteenth century re- 
fuses to place the crank who kills or robs for what he 
considers, or professes to consider, the welfare of society 
under any other class than that of the most dangerous 
criminals. It remains for the ethical sense of the 
twentieth century to sweep the hero worship too often 
accorded such characters out of the world's literature." 

The order and well-being of society must at all 
events be entrusted to the care of the sane. If 
one man is accorded the right to undertake the 
work of reform as the chosen instrument of the 
Almighty, and to set aside the commands of 
the Decalogue, any other man may claim the 
same right, and the multiplication of these 
saviors of society would turn the world upside

POSITIVISM AND THE HISTORY OF 
PHILOSOPHY.* 



Comte, when he wrote his Philosophic posi- 
tive and constituted himself sovereign pontiff in 
the newly erected hierarchy of science, supposed 
that he had performed the last rites over the 
defunct discipline of metaphysics, and that with 
his pronunciation of requiescat in pace this 
troublesome pretender had been forever laid to 
rest. That was half a century ago. After this 
lapse of time we find metaphysics still stalking 
about the intellectual world as alive and vigor- 
ous as in Comte's prime, when he supposed him- 
self to be in mortal combat with it. Indeed, 
a discipline of knowledge, not to say science, 
such as metaphysics, which from the time of the 
Greeks to Comte's own countryman Descartes 
had occupied the very best of the world's talent, 
was not to be throttled in that way. Even sup- 
posing " ultimate reality " to be some mirage 
or will-o'-the-wisp, the pursuit of it had been 
useful, and we shall not impugn the services of 
Plato, Kant, Spinoza, and Descartes to man- 
kind, by saying that their theories should be rel- 
egated to the limbo of idle speculative dreams 
or that their metaphysics should be thrown out 
of the back door into the rubbish of the past. 

The whole trouble was that Comte wrongly 
identified Scholastic Ontology with metaphys- 
ics, and was really occupied in exhuming and 
reburying a thing which was as dead as it ever

ized translation from the fifth French edition by Frank Thilly.

would be and had been successfully interred by 
Bacon and the creators of empirical and induc- 
tive science. One should no more identify a 
single aspect in the evolution of metaphysics 
with the discipline itself than one should excom- 
municate chemistry because it has a historical 
connection with alchemy, or astronomy because 
there might be found in it some hereditary taint 
of astrology. The fact is that speculative phil- 
osophy, the hunt for " being," " reality," the 
" first cause," a Weltanschauung, is an impulse 
that is not only legitimate, but ineradicable and 
necessary in every man of intelligence. " Phil- 
osophy," to quote the words of Lewes, an En- 
glish disciple of Comte, " is inherent in man's 
nature. It is not a caprice, it is not a plaything, 
it is a necessity ; for our life is a mystery, sur- 
rounded in mysteries. We live encompassed by 
' wonder.' " No more is metaphysic a caprice. 
The disposition to seek a unitary principle to 
explain the world is, I believe, inherent in the 
mind. Every religion, apart from the elements 
of feeling in it, the correlation of the sciences, the 
investigation of the criteria of knowledge, the 
inquiry into the relation of mind to matter and 
into the nature of ultimate concepts like " force " 
and " matter " and " cause," are metaphysical 
processes, and every man carries around with 
him, whether conscious of its pernicious charac- 
ter or not, a more or less articulated metaphysic. 
He may not even have heard of that name or he 
may have very serious objections to it as a re- 
puted intellectual disease, but whether he will or 
not (unless he is mentally abnormal) he has his 
own view of life and duty and destiny (or, as 
the Germans would call it, his Weltauschan- 
ung) which constitutes his private metaphysic, 
much as one regrets to thrust on a person some- 
thing he does not want. 

Comte's own philosophy presupposes a meta- 
physic and terminates in a religion, although 
he supposed religion and metaphysics to be the 
two stages in the development which had been 
forever superseded by the final era of positive 
philosophy. In his new ecclesiasticism, science 
takes the place of traditional dogma and Hu- 
manity "with a big H " plays the role of divinity. 
He appears to be unaware of this because he is 
all the while, when speaking of metaphysics, 
employing it in a mistaken sense, in the sense 
of an obsolete transcendentalism ; he appears to 
be always thinking of the scholastic "essences " 
and theology. Now, no one will question the 
statement that all modern philosophy, whether 
it be materialistic or idealistic, is openly hos- 
tile to every unempirical metaphysic. In this

respect there is nothing peculiar to Comte or 
his congeners. Neither is there anything pecu- 
liar to these advocates of positive science in 
their insistence upon verification. In respect 
of rigidity of proof, Descartes, Locke, Hume, 
and Kant were as exacting as the most con- 
scientious investigator of the truths of mathe- 
matics or of the material world. The difference 
is not in method, save in so far as experiment 
may be employed, but in the subject-matter of 
the several disciplines, in the relative illusive- 
ness of their immediate materials. And even 
in the physical sciences, when one comes to the 
ultimate, concepts on which they rest, one finds 
that truth is not to be hunted down with a cru- 
cible or a piece of apparatus. Indeed, it is 
much as Emerson says : " Truth is such a fly- 
away, such a sly-boots, so untransportable and 
unbarrelable a commodity, that it is as bad to 
catch as light." In so far as the physical sci- 
ences may be applied to our comfort and to the 
amelioration of our physical condition, they 
have a certain utilitarian superiority, but in 
so far as they purport to furnish us with a body 
of irrefragable truth about ultimate reality they 
are no better off than metaphysics, for the pro- 
cess in both cases is speculative, though each 
to have any value must have an empirical basis. 
In this connection one need only call to mind 
the atomic theory, the doctrine of energy, of 
motion as an explanation of light, heat, elec- 
tricity, etc., etc. Comte repudiates metaphysics 
altogether. He will none of it, and yet in the 
development of his own system he abandons 
nominalism (which, to be sure, is as much a 
metaphysical hypothesis as is realism), and in 
his Politique positive he talks of that abstrac- 
tion, Humanity, completely unconscious of his 
self-contradiction, as if Humanity had some 
objective reality over and above individual men. 
But is this Humanity anything else than one 
of his much maligned substantiated abstrac- 
tions ? And more than that, this same Human- 
ity is as much Comte's fetish as was the nature 
of the old philosophers or the hypostasized ideas 
of Plato. In his later days he even attempts 
to rehabilitate the subjective method, and so 
turns apostate to his own evangel ; and in his 
creed of the superiority of heart to intellect, 
after he had fallen under the dominion of a 
woman's love, he becomes the weaver of vaga- 
ries, of sheer poetry, with as slender basis of 
fact as have the gossamer systems of the Neo- 
Pythagoreans. We have in this brilliant 
Frenchman the most persistent and learned 
crusade against the traditional philosophy made 



in modern times ; yet his own system had fallen 
largely into disrepute before his own death and 
his disciples have never made any considerable 
propaganda for it. 

A trite objection to the metaphysician is that 
he looks inward to discover what is outside of 
him. But one may retort that positive science 
errs equally in ignoring the subject. Is it not 
equally fallacious to suppose that in science we 
are concerned merely with objective things? 
Is color out there on the painted surface ? or is 
pigment manufactured in the laboratory of the 
eye ? Do we know. things, or do we know only 
certain states of consciousness ? Is there any 
intelligible object without an intelligent sub- 
ject? Are not knowing subject and known 
object indissoluble correlates for science as well 
as for philosophy ? And is philosophy, after 
all, anything else than science become conscious 
of itself and its methods and its ultimate mean- 
ing ? Huxley, in his " Lay Sermons," very 
wisely and charmingly says : 

" When the Materialists stray beyond the borders of 
their path and begin to talk about there being nothing 
else in the universe but Matter and Force and Neces- 
sary Laws and all the rest of their < grenadiers ' I de- 
cline to follow them. . . . Matter and Force are, so far 
as we know, mere names for certain forms of conscious- 
ness. . . . The reconciliation of physics and metaphysics 
lies in the acknowledgement of error on both sides; in 
the confession by physics that all phenomena of nature 
are, in their ultimate analysis, known to us only as facts 
of consciousness; in the admission by metaphysics that 
the facts of consciousness are practically interpretable 
only by the methods and formulae of physics. Their 
differences are complementary, not antagonistic, and 
thought will never be completely fruitful until the one 
unites with the other." 

This attitude towards philosophy on the part 
of the distinguished English interpreter of sci- 
ence is very different from that of Comte, and 
is, I believe, much more representative of the 
spirit of contemporary thought. For this rea- 
son an adequate interpretation of the historical 
meaning of philosophy is at the present moment 
a much desired work. In my opinion, we have 
in Weber's treatise, skilfully translated by Dr. 
Thilly from the fifth French edition, the best 
extant history of philosophy in a single volume. 
It ought to find a large body of readers amongst 
students of science, of philosophy, and of the 
general evolution of civilization. Weber is an 
admirable expositor of philosophical doctrine. 
There is no Scotch mist or German fog here. 
He is perspicuous and direct ; his employment 
of system is well-nigh faultless ; he has given 
us in these six hundred octavo pages, not a lot 
of facts chronologically strung together, but the

conceptual evolution of speculative thought, its 
genesis and development, the mutual relation- 
ships of its doctrines, set forth in such fashion 
that we can see them forming and growing in 
their vital succession from Thales to Schopen- 
hauer. First and foremost, he is thoroughly 
conversant with the matter in hand (that is the 
main thing); and then, his fine sense of literary 
form adds a not unimportant extraneous attrac- 
tion. Matter and form are here happily mated. 
It is a comparatively rare thing for a French 
philosophical work to be translated into En- 
glish. The present instance seems to be one of 
the most justifiable exceptions. 

Weber considers for the most part the meta- 
physical aspect of philosophy ; the disciplines 
of ethics, psychology, and logic, as distinct 
from metaphysics, receive only incidental con- 
sideration. The phases of philosophy which 
are the legitimate subjects of treatment here 
are ontology, scepticism and dogmatism, ra- 
tionalism and empiricism, idealism and realism, 
dualism and monism, atomism and dynamism, 
theism and pantheism, materialism, and similar 
questions. Philosophy, as Weber treats it, is 
intimately connected with the sciences, although 
it has its own subject-matter. The sciences fur- 
nish the raw material of philosophy, and, guided 
by their deliverances, it aims to answer the 
questions as to the origin and meaning of the 
world, the first cause and the end. " The sci- 
ences without philosophy," as Weber says, "are 
an aggregate without unity, a body without a 
soul ; philosophy, without the sciences, is a 
soul without a body, differing in nothing from 
poetry and its dreams." The progress of the 
sciences, if the so-called natural sciences be 
permitted to usurp that term, and the relation 
of philosophy to them, are, therefore, kept con- 
stantly in view through the entire length of the 
treatise, from the rise of the philosophy of na- 
ture amongst the lonians to the latest phase of 
the philosophy of evolution amongst ourselves. 
The stammering infancy, the vigorous manhood, 
and the senile dotage of Greek thought are 
portrayed in living historically faithful outline. 
Not less interesting is the account of the revolt 
from scholastic philosophy at the Renaissance, 
which went hand in hand with a revolt from 
the church, scientific and ecclesiastical reforma- 
tion keeping pace with each other, both born 
of the same spirit of liberty. After a short 
luminous treatment of Pessimism, Darwin, and 
Positivism (Kant and Hegel are, of course, 
examined at considerable length), Weber finds, 
as the leading characteristic of contemporary 



thought, a tendency to a monism of the will, 
which has had only " an accidental and passing 
alliance with the pessimism of Schopenhauer." 
Since modern science has reduced matter to 
force, there is an unmistakable tendency on the 
part both of idealism and materialism to com- 
bine Idea and Force into a monism of the will. 
This monism of the will is the synthesis which 
the three factors in European philosophy co- 
operate in forming. These three factors are 
reason, which interprets the world as a cosmic 
unity, experience, which asserts the universality 
of struggle, and conscience, which sees the 
world under its aspect of moral order. The 
world is observed under the forms of unity, 
effort, and morality. This will, then, is not sim- 
ply the will to live ( Wille zum Leben), but 
will working towards the good ( Wille zum 
Guten). Nature is therefore an evolution, and 
the creative force in this evolutionary process 
is will operating in the struggle for existence 
ever towards the Good as goal. In so far this 
view, philosophically derived, is akin to the 
poet's belief, 

" I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs." 

Small defects, like the lack of appreciation 
of the meaning of Socrates and the rather slash- 
ing criticism of Leibniz's theodicy, and the 
somewhat numerous inexactitudes in quota- 
tions, will not unduly bias the reader against 
the solid merits of the volume as a whole.

" Kingdom and People of Siam " still remains 
the best general account of the country. Vin- 
cent's " Land of the White Elephant," Cort's 
" Siam," and Child's " Pearl of Asia," are also 
worth mentioning. Professor Sommerville's 
work is professedly no more than a series of 
sketches based upon a short visit to Bangkok 
and a flying trip of fifty miles up the Meinam 
to Ayuthia. The first part of the work is taken 
up with a rapid description of the sights of 
Bangkok, the bazaars, markets, temples, and 
especially the far-famed river life of the Venice 
of the East. At evening he finds a great charm 
in the light and sound effects in this water city. 
"The floating theatres add their glare and glitter; 
the supernumeraries stand well out on the platform, 
beckoning with their firebrands; others guard the lights 
of the many-colored paper lanterns ; and here is a show 
where some of the actors stand without, giving tempt- 
ing examples of the entertainment to be enjoyed within. 
Near at hand is a broth and curry-and-rice shop. Two 
or three fellows on a float are striving with string instru- 
ments to tempt some of the pleasure-seekers to enter 
there and amuse their stomachs. Fruit shops and toddy 
boats, all with gay lanterns; and beyond, on a floating 
platform in the subdued light, stands a screen, on which 
a light from within and behind casts a series of silhou- 
ettes. The performer's hand and arms are posed in 
such a manner as to produce representations of birds, 
animals, and human beings; many amusing contests 
between the characters and ludicrous predicaments of 
mirthsome Judys are shown on the screen. . . . The 
artistic performance of the silhouette-maker is inter- 
rupted at intervals by a company of quasi-musicians, 
who, by a terrific blast of horns and ringing of gongs, 
call on the innocents to try Dame Fortune. There are 
floating gambling-shops, where, at games similar to rou- 
lette, so much coin changes hands of an evening that an 
implement resembling a coal-scoop is used to shovel in 
the money, the bankers at the same time paying the 
winners with their hands, which should give all level 
heads an idea of the chances in the game." 

The steamer-ride to Ayuthia and the sights 
there are briefly described. The author then 
gives a chapter on Buddhism, which cannot be 
accounted the best thing in the book, being 
quite too slight, superficial, and prejudiced to 
be of real assistance to the reader. For instance, 
his contention (p. 148) that he has " fully and 
finally " settled the question as to whether im- 
ages are mere symbols, implies both great pre- 
sumption and great ignorance of the animistic 
form of religion. He gives no account of mis- 
sionary work in Siam. The tales illustrating 
Siamese life seem to us a little formal. Though 
this work is neither thorough nor incisive, it is 
yet a brisk and pleasant description. Its inter- 
est is very greatly enhanced by the abundance 
of excellent photographic illustrations, though 
the two pictures of vultures eating a corpse 
might well have been omitted on the ground of 



good taste. The book is well printed and bril- 
liantly bound. 

Of quite a different order from the book just 
noticed is Colonel Pollok's " Fifty Years' Rem- 
iniscences of India." Colonel Pollok writes, 
as he suggestively puts it, in " the hope of 
amusing and instructing those who may be 
thinking of taking to sport in earnest." Here, 
then, we have a book, and an excellent one, for 
the benefit of the thorough-going sportsman. 
Colonel Pollok is firmly convinced that the best 
school for the soldier is in hunting big game ; 
and he has lived up to his convictions. Many 
a campaign has he made against tigers, boars, 
buffaloes, and elephants, and many an enter- 
taining story of adventure is one result, and 
perhaps the best result, of his prowess. The 
story of a hunt for a man-eating tiger, and of 
the assistance he received from some four-footed 
allies, is extremely interesting. The tiger's last 
exploit was the slaying of a girl, and Colonel 
Pollok took up his watch near the corpse, for 
the return of the beast. After waiting some 
time, he inadvertently turned his eyes away from 
the body for a moment, and on looking again 
the dead girl was not there. As no trail was 
found, it was evident the tiger had carried off 
the body just as a cat does a mouse. 

" So, although I ran along some way, I failed to find a 
trail; but just ahead of me I saw a herd of buffaloes, 
headed by a very large bull. The tiger was not likely 
to have gone toward them, for these animals, when to- 
gether, act in concert, and do not fear a tiger. I got hold 
of the gwalas (herdsmen), and promised them twenty 
rupees if they would drive their herd as I should indicate. 
The men took the cattle right across the place where the 
girl's body had lain, and no sooner did the bull smell the 
blood and the scent of the tiger than, with a bellow, low- 
ering his head, he galloped forward, followed by the 
cows and young bulls, tracing the scent much as a pack 
of dogs might have done. I ran my best, hoping to get 
a shot; but the ground was covered with trailing vines, 
over which I kept stumbling, and finally came a cropper. 
By the time I got on my feet again, the buffaloes had 
overtaken the tiger; the bull rushed at him, and I saw a 
brindled mass thrown high up. It had barely reached 
the earth again, when it was again sent flying. The 
tiger roared, clawed, and bit, but he had fully twenty 
beasts on him. I could not put in a shot; if I had rushed 
in amidst the infuriated herd, I stood more than a chance 
of being hoisted myself. The cattle formed a phalanx 
round the tiger, and what with tossing, prodding, and 
kneading, they soon deprived the scourge of the country 
of its life. The buffaloes were in such a state of excite- 
ment that even their attendants hesitated to go in to 
drive them off; the bull in particular would not leave 
his prey; when driven off, he would make a detour, re- 
turn to the charge, with eyes flaring almost out of his 
head, nostrils blowing like a grampus, and furiously 
assail the dead body again. I promised the men ten 
rupees more to get him away, as I did not wish to have 
the skin ruined. They succeeded at last in doing so,

and as soon as the coast was clear I found the tiger 
stone-dead, or rather kneaded into a jelly." 

In the book entitled " Crags and Graters," 
Mr. W. D. Oliver gives a pleasant account of 
some excursions in the little-heard-of volcanic 
island of Reunion, or Bourbon, situated in the 
Indian Ocean some four hundred miles east of 
Madagascar. Reunion is about as large as 
Rhode Island. It is extremely mountainous, 
and contains mineral springs which make it a 
health resort for the neighboring island of 
Mauritius. Reunion, now under French con- 
trol, can hardly be called prosperous at present, 
owing to the lack of proper labor for the sugar 
plantations, and also to absentee landlordism. 
In a direct and unpretentious way the author 
tells the story of his rambles, which, however, 
were only mildly interesting, though his descrip- 
tions of the beautiful scenery are rather tantal- 
izing. On the whole the book is to be com- 
mended as a quite reliable and well-written 
description of a corner of the earth practically 
unknown to most people. 

Major J. R. L. Macdonald, in " Soldiering 
and Surveying in East Africa," gives us a mix- 
ture of adventure and history, the first part of 
the book being mainly adventure and the later 
part history. In surveying the Uganda Rail- 
way he met with adventure in various forms, 
both from wild men and wild beasts. Strange 
to say, bees and rhinoceroses were the greatest 
impediments to his party. More than once 
they were put to rout by swarms of bees or by 
rampant " rhinos." He gives quite the best 
description of a rhinoceros reconnoitering a 
caravan that we have come across. 

" The great beast scents the caravan at once, but can- 
not quite make it out, so he stands facing it, wagging 
his enormous head from side to side in ludicrous uncer- 
tainty. Then up goes his tail, and he comes tearing 
down, only to pull up again after twenty or thirty yards 
to repeat his investigations. To give time for reflection 
and vary the monotony, he then trots along parallel to 
the caravan, till, on an extra strong whiff of scent, he 
wheels round, and makes a headlong charge for a few 
yards. This somewhat stupid, though distinctly enter- 
taining, performance is repeated until, in most cases, the 
caravan has passed safely, and the rhinoceros is left in 
his uncertainty. Sometimes, however, the caravan is of 
such a length, or so slow, that a charge home comes off; 
when the porters drop their loads and scatter, and the 
rhinoceros gallops through the line and away up-wind, 
with his tail in the air, and no damage done." 

A curious custom among the Masai is thus 
mentioned in connection with the freeing of 
some hostages by Major Macdonald's partner. 
" The women were then liberated, and, being 
evidently struck with Pringle, insisted on his 
spitting on each individually in token of friend- 



ship." Major Macdonald gives a careful ac- 
count of the way in which Uganda became a 
British Protectorate, with particular details as 
to the battles in which he was engaged. Espe- 
cially in his chapters on the three Mohammedan 
wars he has made a valuable contribution to 
East African history. 

In their " Letters from Constantinople," 
Mrs. Max Miiller and her husband have con- 
tributed to the literature of travel some agree- 
able descriptions of Constantinople and its 
environs. As Mrs. Miiller's son was Secretary 
to the British Embassy, she obtained extraordi- 
nary privileges ; and she thus describes her 
visit to the wife of a Turkish Minister behind 
the Harem walls : 

" She told me that she drove out once, at the utmost 
twice, a year, in a shut carriage, the only time she passed 
outside those terrible walls. She was fond of her gar- 
den and her pets, cats and birds, but she had no children, 
and, I was told, lived in constant dread that her husband 
would, in consequence, divorce her, for very few Turks 
now have two wives. Her idea of European life was 
founded on French novels, which she read incessantly, 
and she said to me: 'Well, we are happier than you, 
for our husbands may fancy one of our slaves whom we 
know, but your husbands go about with French actresses 
whom you don't know! ' Sweetmeats were brought in 
by slaves, and then cigarettes, but I had to confess my 
ignorance of smoking; and, lastly, the delicious Turkish 
coffee in golden cup-stands. The minister's wife is a 
good musician, and her sister-in-law draws and paints, 
taught by the minister, who is quite a good artist; but 
in spite of music, and painting, and French novels, and 
lovely garden, I had a sad feeling that she was like a 
bird beating her wings against her gilded cage. She had 
read too much to be content." 

As Mrs. Miiller and her husband were treated 
most hospitably by the Sultan and the highest 
officials, their account is in the main rather too 
rose-colored and superficial, and the letters are 
also sometimes too formal in tone, too obviously 
revised for print ; still, the volume affords much 
pleasant, and often suggestive, reading, and the 
illustrations are admirably clear. 

The book entitled " In the Land of Tolstoi " 
is valuable and interesting. Its material is due 
to Mr. Jonas Stadling, and its literary form to 
Mr. Will Reason. Mr. Stadling assisted Tol- 
stoi in relief work during the famine of 1892, 
and had an opportunity of coming into more 
intimate relations with Russian peasant life 
than is often granted to foreigners. He seems 
to think that the Russian peasant is worse off 
to-day than before the abolition of slavery. 
Everyone preys on the mushik, especially the 
money-lenders and Government officials, so that 
he is reduced to misery, and easily attacked by 
actual famine. Many of the accounts of relief

work will be painful reading to the sympathetic 
reader. Mr. Stadling, by the way, helped in 
giving out much of the aid sent from America. 
Mr. Stadling's impressions of Tolstoi are inter- 
esting, and this account of his first meeting with 
him is worth quoting. 

" With a hearty grip of his strong hand he bade me 
welcome, asked about my journey, admired my Lapp 
dress, and showed me into a small room that I was to 
occupy. Then he told me to hold out my feet, and 
pulled off my Lapp boots. This was done so simply that 
they were off before I thought of protesting. Yet the 
spectacle of Count Tolstoi, whose greatness had been 
filling my mind a moment or two before, pulling off my 
boots like a common servant, left me breathless with 
surprise. Then things took their proper perspective, 
and I saw the naturalness of it, and learnt more from 
this little unaffected deed of helpfulness than from all 
the learned lectures I had heard or all the volumes of 
theology I had read. I was in the presence of a man 
who had devoted a whole life to passionate search after 
truth and reality, and had found ' the meaning of life ' 
in following Him ' who came not to be served, but to 
serve ': a man who not only talks about ' egalite etfra- 
ternite,' but whose life is ' egalite etfraternite.' " 

The illustrations in this boob, though not very 
artistic, have much intrinsic interest of subject. 
For instance, there is a suggestion of great 
pathos in the picture of the peasant woman 
with her arm over the neck of her only cow, 
which is about to be seized by the tax-collector.

THE NATIONS OF THE ANCIENT EAST.* 

When but eighteen years of age, so he once 
told the writer, M. Maspero began collecting 
material for a history of the ancient East, which 
later appeared in a modest volume entitled 
" Histoire ancienne des peuples de I 'orient" 
The work has since grown to its present pro- 
jected form of three large volumes. Of these, 
two are ready ; the second, the subject of this 
review, having just appeared in English form.f 
The work when thus completed will offer a very 
detailed historical picture of the great oriental 
world which lies back of the classic age, a world 
which the decipherment of the cuneiform and 
the hieroglyphic has revealed to us within the 
memory of men still living. With the single 
exception of Lenorm ant's work, it is the most

Assyria. By Q. Maspero ; edited by A. H. Sayce ; translated 
by M. L. McClnre. With map, 3 colored plates, and 400 illus- 
trations. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 

t As to the completion of the work, the writer may quote 
from a letter from M. Maspero : " Le troisifime volume de mon 
Histoire auquel je travaille en ce moment . . . paraitra, je 
1'espere, en 1899." 



extensive that has yet appeared in this field, 
and represents an undertaking so vast and com- 
plex in its scope that one can but admire the 
prodigious industry which has brought the task 
so near completion. The first volume, called 
" The Dawn of Civilization " (French " Les 
Origines "), appeared in 1894, and brought 
the history from the beginning in pre-historic 
times down to the end of the feudal age in 
Egypt (the middle empire), and through the 
earliest dynasties in Chaldaea. The second vol- 
ume, " The Struggle of the Nations " (French 
" Premieres Melees des Peuples "), takes up 
the narrative at the rise of the first Chal- 
dean empire and the new empire in Egypt, 
when for the first time the civilization of the 
Euphrates-Tigris valley and that of the Nile 
came into intimate contact and open collision. 
This volume is well named, for it is occupied 
from beginning to end with the successive con- 
quest of Palestine and Syria by these two civ- 
ilizations. Into the account of this struggle is 
woven the story of the minor peoples of this 
region, who were the sufferers in such collisions ; 
and the whole picture is filled out with accounts 
of the geography, topography and roads, re- 
ligion, political organization, commerce, art, 
and the industrial and social life of each na- 
tion. All this, in Maspero's picturesque and 
interesting style, is rendered still more vivid by 
the many beautifully executed illustrations. 
The arrangement of the material, though not 
so convenient for reference as that of Lenor- 
mant, is far superior in giving a complete pic- 
ture of the whole oriental world during each 
great period, instead of separately following 
the career of each nation uninterruptedly from 
beginning to end. The main outlines of the 
picture, however, are sometimes lost, owing to 
the insertion of many pages of archaeological 
material. 

It is useless, within the limits of this review, 
to attempt any adequate analysis of the book or 
any discussion of debatable questions. Of these 
there are many, as the author frankly admits ; 
and he systematically refers in the foot-notes to 
opinions differing from his own, always adding 
the references to the publications where they 
may be found. Indeed, the references to the 
literature of the entire oriental field are aston- 
ishingly full, even for so extensive a work. In 
this respect especially, the volume is an inex- 
haustible storehouse, showing an unusual ac- 
quaintance with the history of the subject. 
Every orientalist will be grateful to M. Maspero 
for the vast quantity of scattered material 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



283 



which he has here brought together. The work 
of Erman, however, seems sometimes to be over- 
looked. 

The distinguished author's name is of course 
quite sufficient surety for the value and char- 
acter of the work in so far as it concerns Egypt. 
Although not an Assyriologist, he is so inde- 
fatigable in his use of translated and edited 
sources, so sober and judicial in his estimate 
of accessible materials and his interpretation 
of the evidence, that the work will also com- 
mand the highest respect in the Assyro- Baby- 
lonian field. It is, perhaps, owing to the enor- 
mous territory thus covered that the volume 
contains more slips than we look for in a work 
of its kind. It would be impossible in one life- 
time to command all the vast range of material 
except by the greatest dispatch in making and 
putting together one's prelimary notes and ob- 
servations. Hence the seams sometimes show, 
and sometimes notes of a curiously contradic- 
tory nature, made evidently at different times, 
are both inserted. Referring to that remark- 
able XVIIIth dynasty queen, Hatshepsut, the 
author says (p. 239) : " She governed with so 
firm a hand that neither Egypt nor its foreign 
vassals dared to make any serious attempt to 
withdraw themselves from her authority." But 
on page 254 he states that " by the end of her 
life she had lost nearly all that her father had 
gained in Syria," which is a flat contradiction. 

In the geography, which is very full, there 
are some strange errors. It is impossible to 
cross the Jabbok on the way from " Bethshan " 
northward to Damascus (p. 138). I suppose 
the author means the Yarmuk. Again, how is 
it possible for the mountains of Moab to shut 
out David at Jerusalem from a view of the 
Dead Sea (p. 727) when the sea was between 
him and the mountains ? 

In connection with the reign of the above- 
mentioned queen, there is an extraordinary 
mistake. Her favorite nobleman, Senmut, 
whose Berlin statue is well known, is stated 
(p. 245) to be " holding between his knees the 
young king Thutmosis III." The figure thus 
held is that of the queen's little daughter Nef eru- 
Re, and her name is inscribed on the statue at 
her side. In describing the Amarna palace of 
the strange king Amenhotep IV., the author 
states (p. 319) : "Altars of massive masonry 
rose in the midst of the courts." This state- 
ment is based on a false restoration in the 
author's archaeology, where a series of doors 
appear as altars (!), a mistake pointed out by 
Steindorff eight years ago. Similarly, in the 



painted pavement of this palace, the row of 
negro and Syrian captives appears at one end 
only, not " at each end of the room " (p. 320, 
cf. fig. p. 321). An evil fate seems to have 
pursued our author at Amarna, for he speaks 
(p. 336) of the " two funerary chapels " built 
there by Ai. These two chapels exist only in 
the Denkmaeler of Lepsius ; the mistake being 
due, probably, to some confusion in Lepsius's 
notes before publication. A visit to Amarna 
discloses only one chapel of Ai, and this con- 
tains all the inscriptions given in the two Ai 
chapels of Lepsius (III., 103 to 106a, 107d 
to 109). It seems strange that this was un- 
known to one who has been active in Egypt so 
long as our author. But leaving Amarna and 
ascending to Abydos (p. 380), there are seven 
chapels in the Seti temple, not " eight " as 
stated. Again (p. 628), the Assyrian chariots 
are said to have " wheels with eight spokes "; 
they have only six. The shaft where the royal 
mummies were hidden at Der-el-bahri is said 
to be 130 feet deep " (p. 771) ; it is less than 
forty feet. 

As the above shows, in matters archaeolog- 
ical the work contains more errors than it 
should. But even on historical ground such 
slips are not entirely wanting. Speaking of the 
Hittite kings (p. 389), the author says : " Khat- 
usaru, a younger brother of Maurusaru, mur- 
dered the latter and made himself king." 
Maurusaru was the father, not the brother, of 
Khatusaru. The brother to whom he intends 
to refer is Mutenr (not mentioned here), whom 
Maspero calls " Mautallu " and recognizes him 
rightly on page 372 (and in Note 3, p. 389). 
Undue haste must be the cause of these errors. 

In the " Expository Times " (March, 1897), 
Professor Cheyne of Oxford has suggested that 
Maspero is unfamiliar with the apparatus of 
Old Testament criticism ; and it must be ad- 
mitted that he has not satisfactorily treated Old 
Testament sources. He simply summarizes, 
without estimating the value of the evidence. 
An amusing error in the use of these sources 
occurs on page 728, where it is stated that the 
Ark, on its return by the Philistines, " was 
placed on a new cart, and two milch cows with 
their calves drew it." The Hebrew narrative 
(I. Sam. VI., 10) distinctly says the calves 
were shut up at home, a circumstance upon 
which the whole point of the narrative turns. 
A number of errors like " eastern " for western 
(p. 433) we omit. It is but just to add that 
one or two of the above slips may be due to the 
translator, for I have been unable to obtain a 



284

copy of the French edition. We wish all refer- 
ences to the maps had not been omitted ; this 
seems strange in view of the numerous refer- 
ences to the illustrations and the numerous and 
excellent maps themselves. We are loth to refer 
to that bugbear of all orientalists, the question 
of orthography. The author makes a praise- 
worthy effort to supply the unwritten vowels 
of the Egyptian. But he should be consistent 
in it. We cannot understand why he writes 
side by side nutir and nofir, when consistency 
demands either notir and nofir, or nutir and 
nufir. Likewise " UsirmaH," but " Amonra." 
We notice that the orthography is sometimes 
not the same in the maps and the text ; this 
may be due to the translator. On page 573 he 
has Sankhoniathon, but on page 572 Sanchon- 
iathon. 

We are grateful to the translator for the 
excellent English which she has given us. 
Without the French, however, we are unable to 
vouch for its correct rendering of the original. 
On page 320, referring to the Amarna pave- 
ment, it is clear that the French arcs has been 
translated " arches " where it means bows. A 
reference to the illustration (p. 321) would 
have avoided this error. In " The Athenaeum " 
of January 2, 1897, a letter signed " Verax " 
exposes a most unfortunate weakness in the 
translation. It consists in systematic and de- 
liberate changes of the wording wherever Mas- 
pero incidentally shows his acceptance of mod- 
ern critical views on the Old Testament. Thus, 
where the original had " tradition related," the 
translation has " the narrative says "; " tradi- 
tion " is regularly changed to " sacred writ- 
ings " or something similar. Thus, in different 
ways, which Verax clearly shows in the " deadly 
parallel column," Maspero's real position is 
concealed. The defense offered (see " Athe- 
naeum," Jan. 9, 1897), by Mr. McClure, whose 
wife is the translator, simply states that Mas- 
pero knew of these changes. This explanation 
does not in the least justify an attempt to de- 
ceive the reader as to Maspero's real views. 
When one remembers that Mr. Sayce, the 
editor, is continually assuring the public that 
the facts of oriental archaeology are daily up- 
setting the results of Old Testament criticism, 
it is easy to understand why it was so impor- 
tant to conceal from the same public the fact 
that a great archaeologist like Maspero accepts 
the conclusions of Old Testament criticism. 

Misprints are rare, and we omit for lack of 
space the short list which we have found. The 
mechanical work on the volume is of the highest 



character. The paper is excellent, the print 
large and clear. We have already referred to 
the excellent workmanship on the illustrations. 
The volume is well and tastefully bound, and 
will be an ornament to any library. It is rarely 
that the student of oriental history and civiliza- 
tion is privileged to review a work like this of 
Maspero, and the few evidences of haste above 
noted do not mar the impression of the author's 
great critical insight and marvellous arbeits- 
kraft, which the reader feels as he lays down a 
volume representing so many years of self- 
denying toil. JAMES HENKY BREASTED. 



TEN BRINK'S LAST VOL.TJME.* 



No single writer has yet completed an ex- 
haustive account of English literature. Morley 
died while dealing with the later Elizabethans, 
and Ten Brink's work came to its unhappy end 
ere the author was well upon the threshold of 
the great Shakspearian age. 

The period under consideration the four- 
teenth century to the death of Surrey wit- 
nessed the beginnings of important movements, 
and to these the book is chiefly devoted : the 
Renaissance, the introduction of Humanism, 
the origins of the Drama and of prose style, 
the poetry of allegory. 

The love of prose romances was fostered by 
Caxton with his busy pen and busier press. Of 
the " Morte d' Arthur," Ten Brink has too little 
to say. Here, one would think, is a subject 
specially fitted for research in the German man- 
ner, with full discussion of Malory's sources ; 
but in this, as elsewhere, we are reminded that 
the author was of a race more nearly akin to the 
English. He seems closer to us in his sympa- 
thies than do most teachers of literature in Ger- 
many. He is not without an ear for the sub- 
tler harmonies and an eye for the romantic and 
picturesque. Of such rememberable phrases 
as enchant the reader in the critical writings of 
Saintsbury and Gosse, he has, to be sure, not 
a great many ; his style is sustained rather than 
brilliant. Yet it has a charm of its own, and 
the translator has been happy in her rendering 
of this charm. Witness the delicate charac- 
terization of " the gracefully mobile figure of 
sensitive Dunbar "; or that of Skelton as " the 
grand virtuoso in verse and language," who 
adorns his song with "melodious repetitions and

endings that ring on the ear." From Lord 
Berner's admirable translation of Froissart, he 
writes, " the chivalrous and romantic tenden- 
cies of the day drew new nourishment." Wyatt, 
with all his attachment to religion, yet cherished 
a " semi-Platonic, semi-Troubadour-like devo- 
tion to Love." And he records with evident 
delight the youthful Surrey's enjoyment of 
" the birds warbling their thanks to Nature for 
the happiness of their loves," or his captivation 
by the charms of the Lady Elizabeth so that 
he " elected her mistress of his heart and of his 
Muse." 

Ten Brink's best work is his chapter on 
Wyatt and Surrey. In tracing the sources of 
their art and of the forms which they imported 
into English song, he has given us a worthy 
close since close it must be of his history. 
From Chaucer and from Petrarch they drew 
copious draughts of inspiration ; from Italy, 
then in the springtide of the Renaissance, they 
brought home echoes of harmonies lovelier than 
any yet heard in England ; and, tireless in their 
endeavoring after beauty of melody and of 
technique, they wrought out enduring measures 
and forever dispelled the prosaic and pedantic 
diction of the old school. The influence upon 
Surrey of Chaucer and of his own fellow- 
minstrel is thus pleasantly stated : 

" Chaucer, one might fancy to have been the intimate 
friend in Surrey's parental home . . . whose image 
remained associated in the son's memory among the 
most cherished impressions of his childhood ; Wyatt, on 
the other hand, seems the teacher to whose school he 
had been sent." 

Following the story of Surrey's unhappy 
devotion to the fair Geraldine, 

" So sweet a wight, so sad, so wise," 
the author gives many a lyric from the poet- 
lover's album of adoration, among them the fine 
sonnet wherein the world first learns of the lady 
and her lineage, 

" From Tuscan came my Lady's worthy race ; 

Fair Florence was sometime her ancient seat," etc. 

So ends, all too early, the work of the emi- 
nent Dutch scholar. His own closing words on 
the noble Surrey have been well quoted by the 
editor as applicable to Ten Brink himself : 

" Great things he might still have accomplished, but 
what he did accomplish has not been lost to posterity."

MR. GLADSTONE'S famous collection of miscellaneous 
articles and essays, " Gleanings of Past Years," has 
been continued in a volume of " Later Gleanings : Theo-

by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 



PHASES or THE SOCIAL QUESTION.* 

All of the books named in the present article 
deserve the attention of those students who are 
interested in the field they cover, although none of 
them are exhaustive treatises. Two of these are 
pioneer studies of interesting developments of social 
life in the United States. 

Soderini's " Socialism and Catholicism " is intro- 
duced to the English-speaking world by this sen- 
tence of Cardinal Vaughan : " Count Soderini's 
work, Socialismo e Cattolicismo, may be taken as 
the best and fullest commentary on the Encyclical 
Rerum, Novarum that has appeared in Italy." 
Twenty chapters are devoted to an analysis of the 
social problems of the age, and to an examination 
of the proposals of Socialism. A sketch of the devel- 
opment of collectivist doctrines, written in a some- 
what florid and polemic style, leads up to a critical 
examination of the central economic doctrines of 
Lassalle and Marx. The lines of the Encyclical 
concerning labor are closely followed, and the en- 
tire book may be regarded as at once a commentary 
upon and a eulogy of the papal treatment of the 
subject. This fact alone would give great signifi- 
cance and value to the work. Eight chapters are 
devoted to " Remedies." The rich are called upon 
to regulate their expenditures according to the laws 
of social health. The State, within carefully-guarded 
limits, may be employed to further the interests of 
the working classes, as in the matter of protecting 
factory children and securing a legal day of rest. 
Associations of employers and employes may pro- 
mote peace and welfare by means of boards of con- 
ciliation. Cooperation, in its many forms, will give 
to wage-earners a method of improving their lot. 
The climax of the book is reached in the plea of the 
last chapter. Religion alone can insure order and 
progress. The Pope has come to the rescue of the 
modern world, the champion of the laborer, the 
emancipator of the oppressed, the guardian of uni- 
versal justice. 

We are sure of walking in the presence of reality 
when we take up a piece of work by Mrs. Bosanquet. 
The study of a London parish, in her volume en- 
titled " Rich and Poor," is done so thoroughly and 
so deeply that world-wide lessons are taught. In 
the first part of the book we are shown, by an artist 
in the craft, how to observe the conditions that effect 
life and character, and in the second part we are 
taught how to take hold and help. Selecting a few

typical sentences, we see the points of view and 
range of ideas. " Character is one amongst other 
economic causes, and as such cannot fail to have 
economic effect." Bribes to the poor to secure 
attendance at worship are held up for deserved 
castigation. An example is given of a legacy of 
1628, which provided 10s. for a sermon, the sur- 
plus to be divided amongst the " poore, weake, aged 
or decayed inhabitants of the parish that shall be 
present at the hearing of said sermon." On the 
subject of old-age pensions, we read : 

" Let those who are interested in the question of old 
age pensions realise the fact that there is in England a 
sum of 1,025,000 per annum actually in their hands 
and available for the purpose, which is now to a large 
extent being frittered away in meaningless doles of bread 
and clothing and half-crowns, which serve no purpose 
but to create greedy expectations and discontent." 

This sentence will reveal a danger of our own out- 
door relief : " It is not an uncommon thing in the 
poorer districts of London for householders to apply 
for charity to pay heavy rates." Our public relief 
fund is largely paid by persons who themselves have 
a hard time to support themselves. There is a play 
of humor which brings to light the sunny side 
of East End London. The character of the local 
practitioner which Dickens ridiculed reappears in 
the conservative quarters of the poor : "A doctor 
who will suit his fees to his patients, and give them 
plenty of medicine in targe bottles, can generally get 
a good practice." Ailments are objects of human 
interest, and their consideration a part of the enter- 
tainment. " A long fine-sounding name does much 
to mitigate the evils of illness, and the woman who 
told me her husband was suffering from the first 
assumptions of paralysis forgot for the moment her 
distress." We are taught that the etiquette of East 
Londoners forbids inquisitiveness. " The man who 
gave his wife standing instructions to say he was 
drunk when the parson called was perhaps within 
his rights." Mrs. Bosanquet helps to correct the 
notion that the life of the poor is altogether sordid, 
hopeless, and without redeeming elements. 

" On the cover of a popular tract, issued by a popular 
society which revels in dramatic misrepresentations of 
industrial conditions, I find the quotation " Hell is a 
City much like London." If this were so I would cheer- 
fully accept a sentence which should doom me to hell, 
and would play my part as a citizen to the best of my 
power; for it would be a city full of pathos and humor, 
where much that is bad is mingled with all that is human 
and lovable, where the very fiends who are represented 
as tormenting the lost are really engaged in works of 
mercy and brotherly love; a city above all where justice 
and straightforwardness and manly effort never fail to 
make their influence felt." 

Those who are interested in the " Forward Move- 
ment " of the " Institutional Church," and in the 
recent developments of social work in many direc- 
tions, will find a very convenient summary and de- 
scription in Mr. Mead's volume on " Modern Meth- 
ods of Church Work." It is rich in suggestions of 
practical methods actually in successful use by 



churches in all parts of the United States. The 
author is in touch and sympathy with the tendency 
which he illustrates, and understands its motives. 
Among the many interesting topics are cardinal prin- 
ciples, the open or institutional church, methods of 
reaching various classes, clubs, and associations of 
men and boys, the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon, 
young people's societies, modes of evangelization, 
educational classes, athletics, temperance and social 
purity work. The chapter on results seems to show 
that the recent methods are highly successful, as 
shown by the earnestness and growth of church 
membership. The discussions are too brief to be 
entirely satisfactory, especially on such subjects as 
charity and reforms. The relation of the church 
to economic and political life, the two chief social 
interests of the people, is hardly touched, although 
the typical church which the author describes " seeks 
to become the centre and source of all beneficent and 
philanthropic effort, and to take part in every move- 
ment which has for its end the alleviation of all hu- 
man suffering, the elevation of man, and the better- 
ment of the world." The optimistic statistics (page 
2 ) declare that since 1800, church members have 
increased thirty-eight fold, while the population has 
increased twelve fold. The statistics of anxious 
doubt (page 49) are difficult to reconcile with the 
hopeful figures, and an explanation is desirable.

covers a wider field than Professor Salmon's work, 
and has a different object. It is adapted to its pur- 
pose of stating the problems of the family life and 
driving home the conviction of their importance. 
Public university lectures delivered to a somewhat 
mixed audience could not go far into technical de- 
tails, but the significance of the various functions 
of the household is made clear and vivid. In a 
rapid sketch of the evolution of industry, the organic 
relation of household activities with all others is 
made plain. The House is analyzed, and its various 
parts interpreted by a description of their uses. The 
main principles of construction are treated under 
the heads " building of the house " and " organism 
of the house," the biological analysis being followed 
quite as far as it is safe to go. The aesthetic mean- 
ing and uses of decoration and furnishing are sug- 
gestively treated. Valuable discussions of food, 
cleaning, and household industries, follow. Of 
course one chapter is devoted to the vexed question 
of " household service," and the discussion of the 
inordinate cost of employment bureaus and intelli- 
gence offices brings to the surface some startling 
facts. The closing chapter is devoted to the theme 
of " organized living," in which a plea is made for 
connecting the family industries in natural relations 
with the industrial and political order of our age. 
Full bibliographies are furnished with each chapter, 
and add much to their value. 

Professor Lucy M. Salmon, of Vassar College, 
has given to the world a discussion of " Domestic 
Service " which is of the highest value. Various 
papers already printed in magazines appear as a

book in more impressive form. The earlier chap- 
ters are devoted to the various historical aspects of 
domestic service in this country during and since 
the Colonial period. It is shown that household 
industry is organically connected with and affected 
by the industrial system which prevails at a given 
period. One important deduction from this discov- 
ery is that the problem is social quite as much as 
personal. It is very generally believed and taught 
that amiability, kindness, and consideration, on the 
part of individual mistresses, would render the pres- 
ent method of employment tolerable. While it is 
admitted that personal qualities have much to do 
with mitigating the evils of the present situation, it 
is shown that the causes of friction are too wide and 
deep to be removed by individual action or charac- 
ter. There is an admirable analysis of the difficul- 
ties, advantages, and disadvantages of domestic ser- 
vice, with illustrations and statistics drawn from a 
careful investigation by the author and from govern- 
ment reports. The vague complaints which one 
hears on every side are here classified and given 
articulate expression. Various " doubtful remedies" 
are shown to be antagonistic to the economic and 
other social conditions of our age or only partly con- 
formed to them. One of the first remedies proposed 
is the removal of the stigma now attached to house- 
hold work, and the frank and honest acceptance of 
democratic ideals in the home. Much value is at- 
tached to the specialization of employments and the 
socialization of household service. This tendency 
has already become conspicuous. For example, 
clothing was once made in the home, but is now 
manufactured in public establishments. Fruit is 
now canned in factories, seldom in the kitchen. It 
seems probable that this specialization will be car- 
ried much further, and the amount of personal ser- 
vice be reduced at a corresponding rate. Very inter- 
esting suggestions are made in relation to " profit- 
sharing." In the strict economic sense, there could 
be no "profit-sharing" in an ordinary household, 
because there are no " profits," only savings. In a 
hotel the term might be employed. It would be well 
to distinguish clearly between profit-sharing and a 
bonus on efficiency or economy, as is done by Mr. 
Schloss. A strong plea is made for great profes- 
sional schools in household science, open only to 
college graduates. Perhaps there would be more 
chance for such a school if the terms of admission 
were not made more severe than those for the legal 
and judicial professions. Yet the ideal is none too 
high. The book should be carefully studied by all 
who believe that the Family is the primary agency 
for social reform and progress, and that public health 
and happiness wait for the advancement of its indus- 
trial methods. The author agrees with Miss Addams 
in regarding domestic service as a " belated indus- 
try," clinging desperately to the relics of the feudal 
system long after it has been made obsolete by the 
introduction of machinery and the factory system in 
all other forms of business.

BRIEFS ON_NEW BOOKS. 

The memoirs "The Recollections of Alexis de 
of Count de Tocqueville," edited by the Gomte 
Tocqueville. de Tocqueville and translated by 
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, cover the most inter- 
esting portion of the eminent political philosopher's 
somewhat brief experience in the world of active 
politics, namely, the revolutionary period of 1848. 
De Tocqueville was elected to the Chamber in 1839. 
When the Revolution of February broke out, he 
threw himself into the struggle, resolving to devote 
himself to the interests of the country and of society. 
He was, says his relative, one of the first among 
those whole-hearted, single-minded men who en- 
deavored to keep the Republic within a wise and 
moderate course by steering clear of the two-fold 
perils of Csesarism on the one hand and revolution 
on the other. He was a member of the provisional 
government, and served France well as Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. After the fall of his short-lived 
and perplexed ministry he retired to Sorrento in 
search of needed repose; and it was during this 
time that the notes composing the present volume 
were written. They were not intended for publica- 
tion. " They shall," says M. de Tocqueville, " be 
a mirror in which I will amuse myself in contem- 
plating my contemporaries and myself ; not a pic- 
ture painted for the public." Some of these con- 
temporaries are mirrored with unsparing literalness 
M. Hubert, the Minister of Justice, for instance. 
Says the author : " I have always observed that law- 
yers never make statesmen ; but I have never met 
anyone who was less of a statesman than M. Hubert. 
. . . You must imagine a little, wizened, sorry face, 
shrunk at the temples, with a pointed forehead, nose, 
and chin, cold, bright eyes, and thin, in-drawn lips. 
Add to this a long quill generally held across the 
mouth, and looking at a distance like a cat's brist- 
ling whiskers, and you have a portrait of a man, 
than whom I have never seen anyone more like a 
carnivorous animal." There is a touch of life in 
De Tocqueville's portraits that would have charmed 
Carlyle. The Memoir forms an interesting and 
authoritative record of the brief and changeful pe- 
riod between Louis Philippe and the beginnings of 
the Second Empire ; and it bears throughout the 
impress of the lofty and philosophical mind of its 
author. The volume is neatly made by the Mac- 
xnillan Co., and contains an attractive portrait of 
De Tocqueville. 

Mr. Edward Field's " The Colonial 
Tavern " ( Providence : Preston & 
Rounds) is constructed on the now 
familiar model of Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's books 
on Colonial life. Mr. Field has gleaned his mate- 
rial from the usual sources old diaries, letters, ac- 
count books, town records, and so on and has ar- 
ranged it in the usual way. A number of printed 
volumes have also been consulted, including Roads's 
" Marblehead," Fielden's " Medfield," Chase's 
Haverhill," Paige's " Cambridge," etc. The re-

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



suit is a very amusing and suggestive picture of an 
important side of New England town-life during 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Of that 
life the tavern, or " ordinary," was a centre second 
in importance only to the meeting-house. The for- 
mer edifice was usually built near the latter a jux- 
taposition of " rum and true religion " that, so far 
from being regarded as a snare of Satan by the 
town authorities, was favored and sometimes even 
enforced by them. It is of record, for instance, that 
in 1651 John Vyall of Boston was granted " Lib- 
ertie to keep a house of Common entertainment if 
the Countie Court consent, provided he keep it neere 
the new meeting house." There was certainly sound 
reason for such a proviso in winter. The early New 
England meeting-house was (despite the doctrine 
preached therein) a proverbially chill and frost- 
bitten place ; and it must have been a delightful 
change from its precincts to the neighboring tap- 
room, with its crackling log-fire and restorative 
creature comforts, such as hot flip, cherry rum, etc. 
Mr. Field has extracted some quaint records from 
the tavern accounts. The following, for instance, 
was the great Governor Endicott's score with one 
Joseph Armitage, inn-keeper between Boston and 
Salem : 

" to beare and cacks 6d 

beare & cacks to himself 
and other gentlemen la 2d 

beare and cacks with 
Mr. Downing Is 6d 

beare and a cack 6d 

3s 8d" 

The author has arranged his matter conveniently 
under such heads as : " The Tavern Keeper," " The 
Tavern Sign and Name," "Tavern Cheer and 
Charge," " The Tavern in the Revolution," etc. The 
book is legibly printed, and substantially bound in 
red buckram. 

In a time when readers turn eagerly 
to tne 8tran g e romance of other lands 
or other times, Miss Fiona Macleod's 
The Washer of the Ford" (Stone & Kimball) will 
not lack a welcome. The book is well characterised 
by its sub-title, "Legendary Moralities and Bar- 
baric Tales "; it is a modern rendering of the ancient 
Gaelic tradition, coming to us from the remote 
Western Isles. So far we may have known of Welsh 
and Irish legends. But this is a different matter ; 
whereas the Keltic literature already not unknown 
is chiefly preserved in numberless manuscripts, we 
have here a rescuing of what must have come down 
to us chiefly in popular tradition. It has, therefore, 
its own very curious interest. It is independent and 
individual, for one thing ; not myth, but history, for 
another. Some of the tales that make up the book 
are pagan perversions of Christian stories; some 
are echoes of that remote day when Colomba 
brought Christianity to lona ; some arose from the 
strife between the Gael and the Christian invader 
from the South, and some from the clash between 
the dwellers in the Western Isles and the Vikings

from Norway. It is an unknown and an attractive 
region, with many things in which many will find 
delight. The book has one drawback at least, how- 
ever, and that is a serious one : it is not done by a 
master-workman. We do not pretend to be thor- 
oughly acquainted with the spirit of Gaelic tradi- 
tion, but we know enough of what is written to-day 
to be sure that the author often gives us, not the 
simplicity of the original, but an affectation of sim 
plicity which shows the unpractised hand. These 
tales do not come to us in the naiv&te of the con- 
scious translator ; nor, however, do they have the 
artistic unity of good metaphrase. Hence they have 
interest, but lack charm. Taken in and for them- 
selves, as if they were originals, they would some- 
times seem to us childish, ill-done. As renderings 
of what was genuine and true, they appeal to us, 
and that with such force that we often forget their 
drawbacks. One is a good deal impressed by the 
book, and yet wonders that the impression is not 
deeper : in criticism one must often look a gift-horse 
in the mouth. The best thing in the book, because 
the most genuine, is " Mircatn." As for the tale 
that gives its name to the collection, it is almost 
worthy the author of " Zanoni." 

" I am at a loss to account for this 
violent hurry that has infected the 
world in all its pursuits, and will still 
be making a toil of our pleasures." Such is the state 
of Mr. E. H. Lacon-Watson ; and having quoted 
his remark we have done much to give the discern- 
ing an idea of his volume, called from the second of 
its fifteen essays " The Unconscious Humorist " 
(G. H. Richmond & Co.). We will confess that to 
our mind it is a dangerous experiment suddenly to 
burst loose and write a classic, for people do not 
to-day give to current literature the time necessary 
to appreciate classics. This, however, is Mr. Lacon- 
Watson's affair. He is willing to sit down calmly 
to write essays on " L' Allegro " and " II Penseroso," 
or "An Examination of the Commonplace," or " The 
Waters of Castaly," and a person must sit down 
calmly to enjoy them. As we have hinted delicately, 
there is in these essays a sedate and contemplative 
air, a leisurely amplitude of expression, to which we 
are reconciled in the writings of Bacon or Charles 
Lamb by the inward self-approval connected with a 
perusal of such great works. Mr. Lacon-Watson 
does not always compress the weight of thought into 
his sentences which we find in the philosophic Ver- 
ulam ; he has, perhaps, about as much as Dr. 
Johnson. Nor has he the really dilletante air of 
Lamb ; he has more of the light-minded seriousness 
of Addison. But Mr. Lacon-Watson knows what 
he is about. He leads off with a paper on " The 
Essay," which gives us an idea of what is to follow. 
This paper pleased us so much that we went right 
on and read at once some of those following, not 
all (that would have been piggish), but still enough 
to show us that we had been justifiably interested. 
To our mind, there was much in the old-time man-

ner that is still almost as good as oar smart mod- 
ernity. Of course the purple rioting and the electric 
neology and the aromatic raffinescence are what 
make the real thing, and it 's a pity (for their sakes) 
that the old fellows did n't attain to them ; still, 
there was much that was really good about them, as 
there is to Mr. Lacon-Watson. 

The Rev. James M. Ludlow, D.D., 
L.H.D., has succeeded in infusing a 
new interest in an oft-told tale by his 
manner of telling it, in " The Age of the Crusades " 
(Christian Literature Co.). Not to be hypercritical, 
however, it is provoking to the reviewer to find an 
error upon the first page of the introductory chap- 
ter of an otherwise admirable book. Speaking of 
the enrichment of the Church's hymnody " by the 
songs of those who caught their rhythm from the 
march of the crusading host," the author mentions 
Bernard of Cluny as having caught the spirit of the 
crusaders, and quotes : 

" happy band of pilgrims, 
If onward ye will tread 
With Jesus as your fellow 
To Jesus as your head I " 

in connection with eight lines of John Mason Neale's 
paraphrase of Bernard's world - renowned poem. 
Now, as a matter of fact, the four lines above quoted 
are from a Greek hymn by S. Joseph the Hymn- 
nographer, written two centuries before the age of 
the Crusades. And it is well known to hymnolo- 
gists that Neale's paraphrase is very far from repro- 
ducing the " dactylic hexameter verse, wherein each 
line consists of three parts and two of these parts 
rhyme with each other, while the lines themselves 
are in couplets of double rhymes," of Bernard's ex- 
quisite hymn. In his preface to his long poem, the 
monk of Cluny, so far from recognizing his rhythm 
as caught from the tramp of crusading hosts, 
avowed the belief that nothing but the special inspi- 
ration of God had enabled him to employ this diffi- 
cult form of versification through a poem of three 
thousand lines. The brilliant author's choice of 
specimens of the treasures added to the Church's 
hymnody by the spirit of the Crusading age is un- 
fortunate for the adornment of what is evidently a 
pet passage, in a most conspicuous part of his book. 
The volume is one of the series of " Ten Epochs of 
Church History," of which several have already 
received notice in these pages. 

In Mr. H. Schutz- Wilson's " History 

and Criticism " ( Fisher Unwin ) 

have, not anything on the inter-rela- 
tion of criticism and history, but a collection of 
essays, some historical and some critical. The Life 
of Wallenstein, the Second Part of " Faust," Cal- 
deron and Goethe, Goethe and Carlyle, Carlyle and 
Taine as historians of the French Revolution, the 
Conciergerie, the subjects dovetail into each other, 
and (excepting Bianca Cappello) are so connected 
in a way that one may easily read the book with 
something of a feeling of continuity. The essays on 



historical subjects are the best. The study of the 
Second Part of "Faust" admits frankly that Goethe 
is here involved and over-curious. Such being a 
very prevalent opinion, it is hardly worth writing 
on the point, unless one have something especial to 
say. In like manner it is commonly enough under- 
stood that Carlyle's " French Revolution " was not 
the most unprejudiced statement of absolute fact ; 
that Taine had studied the sources more thoroughly. 
The critical essays, then, except that on Goethe and 
Carlyle, are rather commonplace. The historical 
essays, however, are more interesting. In the study 
of Bianca Capello, we think Mr. Schutz- Wilson has 
met his match : we get but a confused idea of his 
heroine ; Italy in the sixteenth century is a con- 
fused matter at the very best. But the essay on 
Wallenstein is good, and will be read with interest, 
especially by those familiar with Schiller's concep- 
tion. The first essay in the book, however, is the 
best as well as the longest, a detailed and careful 
study of the Conciergerie during the Terror. Here 
the author has a good subject, and a good deal of 
material not commonly known ; and he produces a 
strong and effective piece of work, which is read 
with pleasure and not readily forgotten. 



Botwellian 
memorietof 
General Grant. 



"Ulysses S. Grant: Conversations 
and Unpublished Letters " ( Curts & 
Jennings) is a trim little volume, of 
Boswellian flavor, that repays reading. Its author, 
the Rev. M. J. Cramer, was an intimate friend of 
the General, saw much of him in a social and 
familiar way, and seems to have been unusually suc- 
cessful in judiciously " drawing out " the commonly 
taciturn soldier. Of the General's most interesting 
sayings embodying his views on religion, on slav- 
ery, on the characters of such contemporaries as 
Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Chase, Johnson, etc., 
reminiscences of his early life, of the war, of his 
trip abroad, Dr. Cramer made careful memoranda. 
These jottings, together with a number of hitherto 
unprinted letters by the General, form a volume 
which those desiring an intimate view of the great 
soldier's personality cannot afford to neglect. The 
author, it may be added, was United States Minis- 
ter to Denmark in 1878, and entertained General 
Grant at Copenhagen while the latter was on his 
famous globe-girdling tour.

is the gift of music to those for whom music is really 
written. " It is not an exaggeration to say," writes 
Mr. Krehhiel, " that one might listen for a lifetime 
to the polite conversation of our drawing-rooms with- 
out hearing a symphony talked about in terms indi- 
cative of more than the most superficial knowledge 
of the outward form, that is, the dimensions and 
apparatus of such a composition." It is because of 
this curious ignorance of an art seemingly appre- 
ciated by the general public, that Mr. Krehhiel has 
prepared the little book before us ; and he has done 
the work in so tactful and illuminating a fashion 
that the instinctive but untrained music-lover will 
find it helpful in a very high degree. A few of the 
subjects treated are the elements, the content, and 
the kinds of music, the make-up of the modern or- 
chestra, the oratorio, opera, symphony, sonata, and 
concerto. An instructive feature of the book is the 
series of plates which show the chief orchestral 
instruments in position for playing, and, incidentally, 
the portraits of several well-known performers. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Rev. Philip H. Wicksteed is the editor, and Miss 
Rose E. Self e the translator, of a volume of " Selections 
from the First Nine Books of the ' Croniche Florentine ' 
of Giovanni Villani" (Macmillan). The selection has 
been made with special reference to students of Dante, 
and marginal notes indicate the passages in the works 
of the poet that deal with matters mentioned by the 
chronicler. There is also a special " Index to Dante 
References," besides the general index to the " Chron- 
icle." The work is carefully done, and will be found 
useful by students who do not read Italian. 

The Statesman's Year-Book" for 1897 (Macmillan), 
still issued under the editorship of Mr. J. Scott Keltic, 
is the thirty-fourth annual publication of that indispens- 
able reference volume. It is more bulky than ever this 
year, made so in part by new matter in the text, and in 
part by a series of folding maps which exhibit, side by 
side, the contrasted political geography of the world in 
the two years 1837 and 1897 which now mark the limits 
of the reign of Queen Victoria. These maps are ex- 
tremely interesting, especially those of Africa and of the 
Colonial possessions of European powers. 

The new " Gadshill " edition of Dickens, of which the 
Messrs. Scribner are the American publishers, has been 
inaugurated with "Pickwick" in two volumes, and 
" Oliver Twist " in one. The form is a square crown 
octavo, and the number of volumes will extend to thirty- 
two. The special feature of this edition is provided 
by the introductions to the several works, which Mr. 
Andrew Lang has undertaken to write, and which are as 
vivacious as might be expected. A general essay on 
Dickens, also by Mr. Lang, will appear in one of the 
later volumes. The illustrations are reproductions of 
the old and familiar etchings of Cruikshank, Seymour, 
and Browne, as well as a series of other drawings by 
such men as Maclise, Landseer, and Marcus Stone. A 
good deal of matter hitherto unincluded in any of the 
complete " editions of Dickens is also promised by the 
publishers, who are altogether to be warmly congratu- 
lated upon their venture. 



I^ITERAKY NOTES. 

The Spring meeting of the Illinois State Library As- 
sociation will be held in Peoria, May 13. An interesting 
programme has been prepared, and a large attendance 
is expected. 

Messrs. H. S. Stone & Co. are soon to publish 
" Maude," a story written by Christina Rossetti when a 
young girl. The story is said to be partly in verse and 
largely autobiographical in character. 

Messrs. Copeland & Day have just published a new 
edition of the " Lyrics " of Father John B. Tabb. It is 
a pretty book and the contents are even prettier. Such 
simple, heartfelt, and exquisite song deserves a large 
audience. 

The Caxton Club of Chicago, most of whose 117 mem- 
bers are book-collectors, has issued a stirring protest 
against the proposed restrictive tariff on books, which 
the club justly declares would be " a step backward and 
a disgrace to our civilization." 

"The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton," the life- 
story of the wife of the famous orientalist and explorer, 
is announced for immediate publication by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. The same firm will issue shortly a new 
volume by M. Maeterlinck entitled " The Treasure of 
the Humble." 

The Dent-Macmillan Balzac now includes " La Femme 
de Trente Ans," translated by Miss Ellen Marriage. 
The Macmillan Co. also send us Peacock's " The Mis- 
fortunes of Elphin " and the poem " Rhododaphne," the 
two works in a single volume of the well-known library 
of standard English fiction. 

An exhaustive " Encyclopaedia of Sport," edited by 
the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire, Mr. Hedley Peek, 
and Mr. F. G. Aflalo, will be published in this country 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. The work will be 
issued in twenty monthly parts, and will contain numer- 
ous photogravure and other illustrations. 

" Hazell's Annual " for the current year has made its 
appearance, and is imported by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons for the American market. Nansen, Rontgen, 
Armenia, Crete, Venezuela, and Li Hung Chang are a 
few of the new subjects treated, and the work is brought 
well up to date on all matters of recent interest. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. will shortly begin, in 
conjunction with Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 
of London, the publication of a history of the Royal 
Navy, commencing with the earliest times and coming 
down to 1898. It will be in five volumes, fully illus- 
trated. Captain Alfred T. Mahan and Mr. Theodore 
Roosevelt are among the contributors. 

About one hundred and fifty of the best drawings 
that have appeared in the well-known humorous weekly, 
" Life," during the last year are now published in a 
handsome quarto volume entitled " Life's Comedy " by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Messrs. Gibson, Wen- 
zell, Hyde, and Hy. Mayer are among the more prom- 
inent artists represented in the collection. 

The handsome and inexpensive " Centenary " edition 
of Carlyle, imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, 
is making rapid progress. We note the receipt of five 
new volumes, three containing " The French Revolu- 
tion," one containing " Heroes and Hero- Worship," and 
one giving the first section of " Cromwell." Occasional 
portraits add to the attractiveness of these volumes. 

Professor B. L. Gildersleeve is to give a course of six

lectures on "The Language, Literature, and Life of 
Greece " before the Northwestern University, at Evans- 
ton, Illinois, during the week of May 10. The subjects 
are: " A Grammarian's Spectacles," " An Evening with 
Odysseus," "An Hour with Sappho," "A Talk with 
Aristophanes," " Poet and Potter," and " Hellas and 
Hesperia." 

Mr. George P. Humphrey, of Rochester, N. Y., has 
begun the publication of a series of "American Colonial 
Tracts," to be issued monthly. The work is designed 
to offer in convenient form and at a reasonable price 
some of the more valuable pamphlets relating to the 
early history of America, which, although of much im- 
portance to the historical student, have hitherto been 
inaccessible to the general public. 

Captain Mahan's "The Influence of Sea- Power on 
History" and Dr. Griffis's life of Commodore Perry 
have recently been translated into Japanese. The Rev. 
Mr. Allen, an American missionary in China, has writ- 
ten a twelve-volume history of the war between Japan 
and China, a work which required 90,000 characters for 
the printing, and which has been so successful as to be- 
come the prey of the Chinese pirate-publisher. 

The first volume of the new illustrated edition of 
Francis Parkman's Histories will be published by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. this month. The edition is a 
limited one, and will be printed from entirely new type. 
It will be in twenty volumes, and will be illustrated with 
one hundred and twenty photogravure plates, consisting 
chiefly of authentic portraits and contemporary prints, 
with a number of original illustrations by noted artists. 

Since the publication of the article on "The Preser- 
vation of Historical Material in the Middle West," in 
the last issue of THE DIAL, we have received from Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites, Secretary of the Historical 
Society of Wisconsin, a timely pamphlet on the duty of 
public librarians in collecting for preservation the his- 
torical materials of their respective localities. The 
pamphlet truly says that no exact list can be made of 
such material, but suggests especially complete news- 
paper files, printed reports of all public bodies, cata- 
logues and programmes of institutions, published ad- 
dresses, local church literature, and programmes of local 
entertainments. Mr. Thwaites makes an urgent plea 
for the present generation becoming missionaries for the 
next in the collection of this valuable driftwood. 

The first number of the new " Journal of Germanic 
Philology " contains several articles of a strictly linguis- 
tic nature, and also two of a more purely literary type. 
The journal is based on a firm foundation, and ought to 
meet with success at once. Professor G. E. Karsten of 
the University of Indiana is editor-in-chief, and his 
associates are Professor Georg Holz of Leipzig, who 
will look after the European interests (some sixty Ger- 
manists of Europe have promised contributions), Pro- 
fessor A. S. Cook of Yale for the English department, 
Professor H. S. White of Cornell for the department of 
German literature, and Mr. G. A. Hench of Michigan 
for the Germanic grammar. Financial support has 
been provided by the patronage of seven public-spirited 
gentlemen of Indianapolis, and the journal is published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co. Only articles by specialists will 
be admitted, but the journal is intended for teachers of 
all grades and for students of Germanics, and through 
the medium of teachers in academies, colleges, and high 
schools, it ought to establish a close relation between 
pure and applied philology, between the study and the 
class-room. The term " Germanic philology " ig accepted 



in the broad sense laid down in Paul's Grundriss, and 
through the influence of the journal much of the narrow 
prejudice too often existing between the mere linguist 
and the student of belles lettres ought to diminish.

THE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE 
AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 

By MOSES COIT TYLER, Professor of American History in 
Cornell University, and author of "A History of American 
Literature during the Colonial Time," etc. Two volumes, 
sold separately. 8vo, each, $3.00. 

Vol. I., 1763-1776. Vol. II., 1776-1783. 

" This work is the result of an altogether new and original treatment 
of the American Revolution. In the present work, for the first time in 
a systematic and complete way, is set forth the inward history of our 
revolution the history of its ideas, its spiritual moods, its passions, as 
these uttered themselves at the time in the writings of the two parties 
of Americans who either promoted or resisted that great movement. 
The plan of the author is to let both parties in the controversy the 
Whigs and the Tories tell their own story freely in their own way. 
Moreover, for the purpose of historic interpretation, he has recognized 
the value of the lighter, as well as of the graver, forms of literature, 
and consequently has here given full room to the humorous and satir- 
ical side of our Revolutionary literature its songs, ballads, sarcasms, 
and literary facetiae." 

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE 
DURING THE COLONIAL TIME. 

By MOSES COIT TTLBH, Professor of American History, Cor- 
nell University. New edition, revised. Two volumes, sold 
separately. 8vo, each $2.50. 

Vol. I., 1607-1676. Vol. II., 1676-1765. 

" In the execution of his work, Professor Tyler has evinced a skill in 
the arrangement of his materials, and a masterly power of combination, 
which will at once place it in a very eminent rank among American 
historical compositions. It is not so much the history of a special de- 
velopment of literature, as a series of profound and brilliant studies on 
the character and genius of a people of whom that literature was the 
natural product. The work betrays acute philosophical insight, a rare 
power of historical research, and a cultivated literary habit, which was, 
perhaps, no less essential than the two former conditions to its success- 
ful accomplishment. The style of the author is marked by vigor, orig- 
inality, comprehensiveness, and a curious instinct in the selection of 
words." GEORGE RIPLBY, in The Tribune. 

THE LITERARY MOVEMENT IN FRANCE 
DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 

By GEORGES PKLLISSIER. Authorized English version by 
ANNE G. BRINTON, together with a General Introduction. 
8vo, about $3.00. 

The eminent French critic, M. FERDINAND BRUNETIERE, says of this : 
" M. Pellissier's work is no less the picture than the history of contem- 
porary French literature. In addition, it is also the philosophy of, or 
rather describes, the evolution of the literary movement of our country. "

M. BRUNETIERE'S PEDAGOGICAL 
PRESCRIPTION. 

The visit to this country of M. Ferdinand 
Brunetiere is one of the most important " lit- 
erary " events of recent years. In significance 
and influence, it may be compared only with 
Matthew Arnold's visit of fifteen years ago ; 
for M. Brunetiere is as distinctly the first of 
living French critics as Arnold was of English 
critics then living. This does not in either case 
mean it never means that any one man can 
be an absolute ruler in the critical domain, or 
that all of his judgments must be taken as 
finally authoritative. But it does mean, with 
both the Englishman and the Frenchman, that 
an unusually successful effort to eliminate the 
personal equation, and to see things as they 
absolutely are, has invested the judgments of 
these two men with a degree of authority hardly 
to be claimed for any others of their genera- 
tion. 

In one of his New York lectures last month, 
M. Brunetiere said that no one had followed 
more anxiously or more disinterestedly than 
himself the French literary movement of the 
past score of years. He then added, in a pas- 
sage which may be taken as the keynote of his 
entire critical career : 

" The first condition of disinterestedness is never to 
follow one's tastes, and to begin by distrusting the 
things which give us pleasure. The most delicious 
dishes are not the most wholesome; we never fail to 
distinguish between our cooks and our doctors. In the 
moral world the beginning of virtue is to distrust what 
is most natural to us, and the same is true in the intel- 
lectual world. To distrust what we like is the begin- 
ning of wisdom in art and literature." 

These words represent so accurately what has 
always been the attitude of THE DIAL toward 
the fundamental doctrine of criticism that we 
hardly need, in so many words, to express our 
concurrence with M. Brunetiere in this all- 
important matter. That the value of literary 
work must be determined with reference to law 
and not to caprice, that the only valid critical 
judgments are those which are free from the 
taint of subjectivity, and that personal opinion 
represents only a rudimentary stage in the de- 
velopment of criticism, are propositions that 
mean substantially the same thing, and that it 
is the first duty of the critic to recognize and 



300 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



to justify. What is commonly called " subjec- 
tive criticism " may be, and frequently is, read- 
ing of the most delightful sort, but it is not 
criticism in any real sense, for its aim is the 
illumination of the recesses of the writer's own 
mind, rather than of the work held up for ex- 
amination. It is always pleasant to follow the 
play of a finely sensitive intellect about some 
production of literary art, but it does not help 
us, except in a very roundabout way, to under- 
stand that production in its essence. 

The function of opinion in criticism is pre- 
cisely what it is in any other branch of science. 
It assists in the framing of hypotheses, which 
may, in their turn, lead us by tentative paths 
to the truth. But to make of opinion an end 
in itself is a procedure as grotesquely inade- 
quate in aesthetics as it would be in physics. 
What would be the present position of natural 
science if its masters had remained content with 
their neat hypotheses, and had spared them- 
selves the arduous tasks of modification by ex- 
periment and of ultimate verification ? Grav- 
itation and evolution and the conservation of 
energy were once matters of opinion, with no 
binding force whatever. If Newton and Dar- 
win and Helmholtz had been content to put 
these things forward as opinions, the world 
would soon have forgotten their names. But 
the opinions became unquestionable truths 
when they were enforced by the application of 
a rigorous scientific method, and we honor the 
men who established them for the very reason 
that those men knew the assertion of opinion 
to be but the beginning of knowledge. 

It is doubtless true that the science of aes- 
thetics offers a peculiarly difficult field for 
investigation, and that critical opinion often 
requires a long time to ripen into knowledge. 
But we must not for that reason imagine that 
there is any finality in opinion, that its char- 
acter is other than transitory or provisional. 
The subject may be illustrated by the history of 
the reputation of every great writer who has 
been long enough before the public to acquire 
recognition among the fixed stars of literature. 
M. Brunetiere took Racine for the special illus- 
tration of this thesis. 

" M. France said : We know only ourselves. What- 
ever you are trying to explain, you are only expounding 
yourself. Shakespeare alone has known Shakespeare.' 
I answered M. France that his argument that we cannot 
go outside of ourselves proves too much, as it applies to 
our knowledge of the physical world as well as to our 
knowledge of other minds, and I added that one of the 
men who knew Victor Hugo least was Victor Hugo. 
M. Lemaitre says: 'I have an opinion of Racine. You 



have another. Good, that makes two. Perhaps there 
is another; that makes three. There may be an infinity 
of them. Why should one submit to another ? It is 
much more amusing to have three opinions of Racine 
than one, still more amusing to have an infinite num- 
ber.' I answered M. Lemaitre that no doubt there were 
several opinions about Racine, but that he, the master, 
with his elegant, ' malicious,' and subtle spirit, exagger- 
ated the differences of human opinions. It is certainly 
agreed that Racine is a great man, that he is a higher 
dramatic genius than Voltaire, for instance, and a lower 
one than Corneille, and such general agreements are all 
we need for our kind of criticism." 

Here the discussion ends, as far as Racine is 
concerned ; but the speaker might easily have 
gone on to show that the position of Racine is 
not thus fixed merely because of a practically 
unanimous consensus of opinion, but that this 
consensus itself is the resultant of forces by 
which the judgment of every serious critic is 
more or less consciously determined, that it 
follows from the very laws of literary art. 

A writer in the New York " Nation " has 
recently undertaken to traverse this funda- 
mental doctrine of M. Brunetiere's creed. Tak- 
ing for his text the very paragraph that we 
quoted at the beginning of the present article, 
he says that the " analogy of the delicious but 
unwholesome dishes is a little misleading." He 
then goes on as follows : 

" The primary object of eating is to nourish the body, 
not to please the palate. . . . With the work of art, on 
the other hand, pleasingness, in the broad sense of the 
word, is the final test of excellence. Its usefulness is to 
please. There is no higher court of appeal, no doctor 
with exact scientific tests who has a right to pronounce 
it good though disagreeable, or bad though acceptable 
to the taste. It is true that the moralist often arrogates 
to himself this right, but he is only a fallible brother 
expressing an opinion. One is a moralist one's self." 

The shallowness of this reasoning is so apparent 
that it need not be taken very seriously. It is the 
old plea for hedonism transferred to the plane 
of aesthetics, and is defended by the old familiar 
logomachies. We are quite content to admit 
that aesthetic law can have no higher claim to 
authority than moral law, and should even have 
been willing to allow that the moral law was 
the better defined and the more firmly grounded 
of the two. " One " may be " a moralist one's 
self," if he please, but the consequences of this 
sort of individualism, if put into practice, are 
likely to be distressing. So, in aesthetical mat- 
ters, one may be a critic one's self, to his heart's 
content, but his position, if he set up his pri- 
vate judgment against the collective judgment 
of the best informed in a succession of genera- 
tions, will not prove exactly comfortable. 
But our individualist critic practically aban- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



301 



dons his own position in a passage that soon 
follows : 

" Of course this reasoning does not apply to the young, 
whose tastes are in the formative stage, or to the men- 
tally indolent who have never reflected on their own 
tastes. In the interest of education such persons may 
very well take to heart the maxim to distrust their own 
taste. But it is hardly to be supposed that M. Brune- 
tiere meant to offer a pedagogical prescription." 

Is it not? In our opinion, that is precisely 
what M. Brunetiere did mean to offer. Most 
people are either young or mentally indolent 
as far as the appreciation of literature is con- 
cerned. To like a book is one thing, and to 
know whether or not it is a good book, and why, 
is quite another thing. It is the natural man 
whom M. Brunetiere seeks to warn, not the 
man of trained perceptions and sympathies. 
We presume that M. Brunetiere has a great 
deal of confidence in his own likes and dislikes, 
the reason being that a strenuous process of 
analysis has transferred them from the plane 
of prejudice to the plane of deliberate and rea- 
soned judgment. And it is just because he 
knows so amply from his own experience how 
great is the difference between a prejudice and 
a judgment, between the likes and dislikes of 
the natural man and those of the critic whose 
historical sense has been developed by the wid- 
est reading and who has learned to substitute 
scientific method for empiricism, it is just be- 
cause of these facts that he offers us the " ped- 
agogical prescription " so much needed in this 
country, which has as yet produced but little 
critical writing in the high and true sense of 
that term. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



IN DEFENSE OP THE MAGAZINES. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Mr. Chapman's frankly subjective letter raises a 
question a series of them on which light is most 
desirable. The case seems to me too gloomily put. 
" Prevailing flatness and sameness " is not the present 
condition of fiction, at any rate. Any and every sort of 
originality, especially in the short story, is eagerly caught 
at. The market seems enormous, production is entirely 
too much encouraged, and certainly nothing like so 
many different publications were ever afloat at one time. 
Biography (to take a fair instance) is generously treated, 
and much creditable work is being done. Certainly 
Mr. Woodrow Wilson does not seem like a product of 
deforming conditions. Consider, again, Mr. John Fiske's 
success. 

As to magazine poetry, it is harder to be optimistic. 
Probably there is no real demand for it anyway, good 
or bad, and so each magazine fills those little chinks 



between articles with the rhymes of the editors and of 
their cronies. That is what Whicher and I say to each 
other, at least, when our good sonnets and chants are 
"in process of being rejected by all the principal mag- 
azines." Still, I believe, and hope, there is always a 
wide niche for the real thing, whenever Miss Edith 
Thomas, for instance, is inspired to sing. And T. W. H., 
a writer both delicately artistic and prolific, says in 
public that he never got but one thing back. O Colonel ! 
How can a man so spoiled by prosperity retain such 
tender sympathy for failure and crudeness in others ? 

Mr. Chapman has himself had a very full and fair 
hearing, in our most conservative literary monthly, this 
very year, for the express purpose of traversing sharply 
the vague veneration felt for our most venerable (Amer- 
ican) classic author. If his briefer paper goes a-begging 
for a hearing, there is a large general reason that may 
explain it. There is a deplorable lack of interest, 
among our people, in literary criticism. 

Since the experience-meeting example is already set, 
I may perhaps continue it. Mr. Chapman took the 
trouble to applaud my paper on " Nausicaa," and asked 
for more. But the publishers knew they had given me 
an over-generous hearing on such themes. They were 
quite right to shut the door at last. In the long run, 
the public should not be fed with what it certainly 
does n't want. When my first collection of Greek papers, 
with " The Atlantic " (and much generous reviewing) 
behind it, failed to sell seven hundred copies in seven 
years, it was high time to accept the broad hint, and to 
devote all the limited space of the magazine to fresher 
themes. 

But, speaking for the barred-out, I still say heartily, 
the great magazines are well up among the best elements 
in our national life. Abuse the daily papers as much 
as you please, and I for one cry Amen! I wish I had 
the courage and firmness to refrain from reading them, 
and to save the time for the immortals whom Mr. 
Mabie mentions in every sermon. Does he really read 
his Dante yearly ? The dust is undisturbed on mine, 
from one house-cleaning to the next; but I know the 
record of league base-ball games up to yesterday. We 
are what we are, very near the end of the century. The 
magazines give us the best we will tolerate, and far 
better than we deserve. Mr. Chapman himself confesses 
they are the young author's one chance for a hearing 
and an income. Why complain of them, that they will 
not print what we cannot, or dare not, offer the dear 
public in separate book form ? 

There should be an ideal audience for ideally good 
work? Yes: that is true. There should be a literary 
organ so liberally endowed that it should be absolutely 
independent of its readers or its buyers. It should have 
a goodly corps of editors, as eminent, as fearless, as 
critical, as can anywhere be found. Admittance into 
its pages should be as much a matter of pure literary 
merit as twenty Charles Eliot Nortons could make it. 

Personally, I think a million dollars could not be 
better laid out. I even believe the ideal publication 
would pay very fair dividends, and have a very large 
circulation provided always it remained clearly 
indifferent to both ! But such a thing never existed, 
doubtless, anywhere. Meantime, why complain that 
legitimate and beneficent enterprises, which minister 
delightfully to widely-felt needs, are partially influenced 
by necessary business principles ?

A NAPOLEONIC MARSHAL. AND HIS AIDE.* 

Of additions to the stock of memoirs of Rev- 
olutionary and Napoleonic times there seems no 
end. Talleyrand once assigned vanity as the 
leading motive force of the French Revolution ; 
and one who reads attentively the annals of that 
era can scarcely fail to note in the bearing of 
its worthies a tinge of the histrionic, a tendency 
to pose and perorate, even when the boards 
they trod were the ensanguined planks of the 
guillotine. It was natural that men so con- 
vinced of the importance of their individual 
roles in the drama of their time should be solic- 
itous lest history should obscure or belittle 
those roles in the eyes of posterity. There 
were few of them who did not at least place it 
in the power of someone they implicitly trusted 
to amply record what they had been and done. 
Such seems to have been the case with Marshal 
Oudinot, Due de Reggio a brilliant soldier 
and steadfast man, whose name is an often re- 
curring one in the story of the Napoleonic wars, 
and whose memoirs, compiled from the souve- 
nirs of his wife, are now for the first time done 
into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, 
forming a volume of some 460 pages. 

Nicolas Charles Oudinot (1767-1847) was 
one of the many men of talent and energy for 
whom the Revolution opened a path to distinc- 
tion that must in all likelihood have been closed 
to them under the old order. The son of a 
brewer of Bar-le-Duc, he began life a common 
foot-soldier, and ended it a Peer and Marshal 
of France one of the most notable figures of 
an era prolific of notable men. He owed his 
advance, or at least his repute in high places, 
scarcely less to his integrity and steadfastness 
as an administrator than to his capacity as a 
soldier. He won laurels in the first Austrian 
and the Russian campaigns, and at Bautzen 
and Leipzig. In 1812 he led the second corps 
in the invasion of Russia, and so skilfully pro- 
tected the crossing of the Beresina that he was 
hailed as the " preserver of the army." On the 
return from Elba, Oudinot, who had a high

sense of loyalty, remained faithful to Louis 
XVIII., though his command went over en 
masse to the Emperor. He refused to serve 
during the Hundred Days. " Well, M. le Due 
de Reggio ! " said Bonaparte ironically to the 
inflexible soldier, " and what have the Bourbons 
done more for you than I, to make you want to 
defend them so finely against my approach ? " 
For once the speaker had failed to read and 
appreciate his man. After Waterloo, Oudinot 
was made Commander-in-Chief of the National 
Guard ; and he made a determined effort to 
save his old companion in arms, Marshal Ney. 
He finished his career as Governor of the 
Invalides, under Louis Philippe. 

On Oudinot's death, letters of condolence 
were received by his family from sovereigns of 
countries against which he had fought and 
whose local affairs he had administered under 
the great foe of all. One of these letters espe- 
cially, from Frederick William of Prussia, 
breathes the warmest regard for the dead sol- 
dier of the Empire, and attests that he was a 
magnanimous, as well as a formidable, foe. 

The Duchesse de Reggio's narrative is flu- 
ently and simply written a frank and unpre- 
tentious tale wherein a mother retraces for her 
children the different phases of her own and 
their father's chequered existence. Much of 
the value of the book is due to the painstaking 
work of the compiler, M. Gaston Stiegler. 
There are interesting portraits of the Marshal 
and his wife. 

Among the military memoirs of Napoleonic 
times those of the soldier-painter Baron Louis 
Francois Lejeune possess a charm and charac- 
ter distinctive enough to entitle them to rank 
as a book apart. Lejeune was a soldier through 
stress of circumstances, an artist by choice and 
temperament. His military career was long 
and distinguished ; but it is plain to the reader 
of his memoirs that he mentally signed himself 
painter, not soldier, throughout. In the lull of 
a campaign we find him studying such collec- 
tions of art as offered themselves ; and where 
the interval of peace was long enough he re- 
turned to Paris and his easel as to an occupa- 
tion interrupted. The artist's temperament 
everywhere lends color and character to his 
narrative. In the main, Lejeune depicts for 
us a scene or an incident, not because it was 
historically important, but because it appealed 
to his artistic sense formed, in fact, an attrac- 
tive or a striking motif ior a picture. He inter- 
rupts the account of an advance of his division

on the eve of Austerlitz, to paint the charms of 
a wintry landscape ; the grim details of a siege 
are relieved by bits of genre and sentiment 
touched in by a master-hand. In portraying 
the moving incidents and ghastly minor accom- 
paniments of war, in making the reader see and 
feel what war means to people who directly 
share in it and suffer by it, Lejeune has few 
rivals in literature. Nothing in Tolstoi or Zola, 
no canvas of Verestchagin, excels in lurid real- 
ism his description of the siege of Saragossa. 

We have heard something in this country of 
late as to the " educative value " of war, as to 
its saving efficacy as a national regenerator and 
tonic for patriotism grown languid. War, so 
far from being, as commonly supposed, a thing 
essentially brutalizing and demoralizing to 
those waging it, is held by the philosophy of 
chauvinism to be the grand conserver of the 
national bond and fountain of the civic virtues. 
In Lejeune's narrative there is little that tends 
to support this paradoxical theory of the tonic 
effect upon national morals of recurring periods 
of wholesale havoc and bloodshed. On the con- 
trary, we can point to no more cogent peace 
tract, no more shocking picture of the satanic 
moral and physical results of the frenzy of 
battle, than Lejeune's account of the siege 
and storm of Saragossa. The awful straits 
to which the inhabitants of the town were re- 
duced, and the fanatic fury of their resistance, 
is familiar matter of song and history. In the 
train of slaughter and famine came pestilence. 
The famishing wretches, herded in fetid vaults 
and cellars to escape the hail of bombs that 
crashed through the roofs of their houses, died 
in droves, stricken as by an unseen hand. 

" Many were no longer strong enough to remove their 
dead, and those corpses which were carried into the 
streets or to the doors of the churches remained there 
without burial. Often bombs would burst and shatter 
the dead to pieces, tearing them from their tattered 
shrouds, so that at every turn the most horrible sights 
met the eye. ... I can still see one room in the second 
story of a house which had been broken into and par- 
tially destroyed from the bottom to the top. An ex- 
plosion had surprised a father and a daughter just as 
they were taking their siesta after their meal by a little 
round table, on which a few drinking vessels still re- 
mained. The old man, who was pretty well dressed 
and partly wrapped in his cloak, was seated in a big 
black wooden arm-chair, and his daughter was stretched 
on a rush mat at his feet. There was nothing in their 
features to betray what they had suffered, and during 
the few minutes I spent near the motionless group I 
really wondered whether the bodies were real or made 
of wax." 

Lejeune draws a grewsome picture of the 
scenes in and about the Convent of St. Francis, 



which the French took by assault after a most 
determined resistance. More than four hun- 
dred Spanish workmen and a whole corps of 
grenadiers had been destroyed at a blow by the 
explosion of a mine under the convent walls. 

" Not a step could be taken without stumbling over 
torn limbs, often still palpitating, hands or fragments of 
arms torn from the bodies to which they had belonged, 
revealing to us how fearful and widespread had been 
the catastrophe." 

The vestiges of carnage were strewn even to 
the roof of the shattered church. A grenadier 
who had pursued the few surviving Spaniards 
thither, drew back in horror, exclaiming : 
" Look at that stream of blood ! Look at the 
lamentable results of obstinacy and rage ! " 

" We looked and saw the blood of a number of Ara- 
gonese flowing beneath our feet into the gutters of the 
roofs, whence it poured through the prominent Gothic 
gargoyles, representing dragons, vultures, and winged 
monsters. For some eight centuries nothing but rain- 
water had flowed from these gutters and spouts; but 
now, by a horrible contrast, they vomited forth upon 
the assailants below torrents of human gore." 

The French, after the outer walls were breached, 
forced their way into the city with the aid of the 
sapper and the miner literally foot by foot. 

" As soon as a house was taken, a miner was sent 
down to the lowest part of the cellars, where he set to 
work to open a mine beneath the street or under the 
next house so as to reach the one we wanted to attack. 
This mine was then charged in the most profound silence, 
and with such skill that the line of least resistance was 
beneath the condemned house. Directly after the ex- 
plosion the soldiers, who were held in readiness, flung 
themselves through the clouds of dust which arose, and 
took possession of the ruins of the house just thrown 
down, where to secure possession they quickly barri- 
caded themselves and awaited the night. . . . One 
day it so happened that two parties of miners one 
besieged, the other besiegers debouched at the same 
moment from their rival galleries in the same cellar; 
and there, in the gloom, scarcely relieved by the light 
of their lanterns, they flung themselves upon each other 
with their tools, their knives, and their sabres, without 
waiting for any other weapons. It was indeed war to 
the knife promised us by Palafox. The furious blows 
exchanged knocked down around the combatants the 
great stone jars used by the Spanish for storing wine 
and oil, and those who were struck down by pick or 
matlock were drowned in a mixed flood of wine, oil, and 
blood." 

A dramatic picture is drawn by Lejeune of 
the storming of the Convent of the Nuns of 
Jerusalem. The plight of the pious inmates, 
who saw their once peaceful haven wrapped. in 
flames and defiled by carnage, was pathetic 
enough. 

" As we approached we saw them tearing down from 
the altars the objects of their chaste devotion, in the hope 
of saving them from destruction. The devoted women, 
with no thought for themselves and inspired only with

religious zeal, took nothing with them but crucifixes and 
images of the Infant Savior, which they held closely in 
their arms as they abandoned, with heartrending cries, 
the only homes they had, strewn with tokens of their 
piety and loving kindness. In all the chapels were nu- 
merous pretty little figures in colored wax representing 
the Infant Jesus, with snow-white lambs decked with 
ribbons and various ornaments invented by the childlike 
imaginations of the guileless nuns. Wounded soldiers 
fell across mangers decked with flowers, evergreens, and 
moss, or overturned cradles of the Infant Savior ; and 
the blood of the dying trickled over bunches of immor- 
telles, crowns of roses, and azure-blue ribbons." 

Saragossa fell at last ; and on the appointed 
day the Spanish column filed out in marching 
order, carrying their flags and arms, according 
to the terms of capitulation. Says Lejeune : 

" Never, perhaps, had any of us gazed on a sadder or 
more touching spectacle. Thirteen thousand sickly- 
looking men, bearing in their bodies the seeds of disease, 
all frightfully emaciated, with long black matted beards, 
and scarcely able to hold their weapons, dragged them- 
selves slowly along to the sound of the drum. Their 
clothes were dirty and disordered ; in a word, every- 
thing about them bore witness to their terrible misery ; 
but in spite of their livid faces, blackened with the smoke 
of powder, and scarred with the deep traces of rage and 
grief, their whole bearing still radiated forth an inde- 
scribable dignity and pride. . . . When the moment 
came for these gallant troops to pile their arms and de- 
liver up their flags to us, many of them gave violent ex- 
pression to their despair. Their eyes gleamed with rage, 
and their savage looks seemed to say that they had 
counted our troops, and deeply regretted having yielded 
to such a small number of enemies. They started for 
France, and Saragossa was conquered ! " 

As a compiler of historical anecdotes and 
purveyor of memories of the Emperor, Lejeune 
is naturally inferior to writers like Marbot, De 
Meneval, and Barras. In narrative freshness 
and charm he is the equal of Thiebault ; while 
in purely pictorial quality he has no peer among 
Napoleonic memoirists. E> G> Jt 



MYCENJEAN EXPLORATION SINCE 
SCHUEMANN.* 



In a sumptuous and fascinating volume, 
creditable alike to American scholarship and 
American publishing enterprise, we are pre- 
sented with a record of the remarkable recent 
discoveries, and the latest conclusions based 
upon those discoveries, at the sites of Mycenae, 
Tiryns, and Troy. These conclusions may 
be briefly announced thus : first, that a rich

Culture of Pre-Homeric Greece. By Dr. Chrestos Tsountas, 
Ephor of Antiquities and Director of Excavations at Mycenae ;

Literature and History at Brown University. With an Intro- 
duction by Dr. Dorpfeld. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



and artistic civilization prevailed at Mycenae, 
Tiryns, Troy, Orchomenus, and Amyclae ; sec- 
ond, that the " bloom-time " of this civilization 
was from the seventeenth or sixteenth century 
B. C. down to the twelfth ; third, that the 
Homeric poems, produced after the Mycenaean 
period, yet describe its aftermath of art and 
life. 

The reader is first of all impressed with the 
celerity of archaeological progress since the 
pioneer Schliemann, in 1870, turned the first 
sod on the hill of Hissarlik and opened a new 
and wondrous era for " the science of the 
spade." For twelve years he strove to win the 
world of scholars away from Bunar-bashi to 
Hissarlik as the site of Homer's Troy ; but 
critical scholarship, proverbially shy, shrank 
from his superb enthusiasm, and "only took 
snuff " when he announced that in the sec- 
ond stratum from the native rock he had dis- 
covered the treasure of Priam. The treasure 
was indubitable enough ; but Priam ? In 
1882, however, with the invaluable help of 
Dr. Dorpfeld, the Second City was proved to 
have had an imposing acropolis, and to have 
perished in a great conflagration ; and its 
identity with the Homeric Troy to say noth- 
ing of Priam was regarded as fairly estab- 
lished. But in 1890, Schliemann and Dorp- 
feld returned to the attack, and shifted their 
excavations to the southwest of the burnt city ; 
and here they discovered no less than seven 
distinct layers of buildings above this second 
city. In the fourth layer counting from above, 
or the sixth from the bed-rock, were found the 
remains of a mighty fortress of the Mycenaean 
age, which answered, even better than the Sec- 
ond City, to the description of the Homeric 
Pergamos. The untimely death of Dr. Schlie- 
mann in 1890 left the problem to be worked 
out by Dr. Dorpfeld, whose decision, published 
in 1893, now commands general assent. And 
so the matter stands to-day, as regards Troy : 
namely, that in the Sixth City we have the 
remains of a citadel of the Mycenaean era, and 
that this citadel is, to date, the best claimant to 
Homeric standing. 

The book before us is a collaboration. Dr. 
Chrestos Tsountas, a young Greek archaeolo- 
gist, was commissioned by the Greek govern- 
ment in 1886 to continue the excavations at 
Mycenae which Dr. Schliemann had so bril- 
liantly begun ten years before ; and his " My- 
cenae and the Mycenaean Civilization " (written 
in Greek and published in 1893) was almost 
epoch-making in its systematic treatment of

" the whole subject of Greek culture in the light 
of the monuments." Professor J. Irving Manatt, 
of Brown University, one of our most enthusi- 
astic American Hellenists, undertook the ardu- 
ous but grateful task of making a book which 
should embody all of Tsountas's results with 
all that has been added to Mycenaeology by 
the last three fruitful years, and should spread 
the whole rich record before the eyes of the 
English-speaking world. Probably no better 
interpreter could have been found. Professor 
Manatt has scholarship, experience, and a 
glowing style well held in hand. He has com- 
pletely recast the materials before him ; and has 
certainly given Dr. Tsountas an introduction to 
American and English readers which will place 
him and his work in line with Schliemann and 
Dorpfeld. 

The two great sites of Mycenaean civilization 
are Mycenae itself and its neighbor Tiryns. 
Our authors devote the bulk of their work to 
an elaborate discussion of the discoveries at 
Tiryns and Mycenae, many of which had been 
made familiar to English readers in Schlie- 
mann's " Mycenae " and " Tiryns," and especi- 
ally in the admirable summary of Schliemann's 
excavations prepared by Schuchhardt, and pub- 
lished, in translation, in 1891. Schliemann's 
thrilling announcement, in 1876, that he had 
found the " royal graves in the circle at My- 
cenae, with their heroic tenants still masked in 
gold and their heroic equipage around them " 
(as Manatt puts it), is still fresh in our mem- 
ory. He at once believed and proclaimed that 
these were the graves of Agamemnon and his 
followers, butchered by JEgisthus and Clytem- 
nestra. With almost equal positiveness, Tsoun- 
tas and Mannatt now say : 

" That they are the tombs of a royal line is beyond a 
doubt, but the name of that line we can no more deter- 
mine than we can tell those of the families which fash- 
ioned the great domes (the bee-hive tombs, the ' treas- 
ury of Atreus,' etc.). Whatever hypothesis be put for- 
ward, it must always remain pure conjecture. . . . But 
we do know that many centuries later there was current 
at MycenfE a tradition, certainly mistaken, that the lar- 
gest and the finest of the domed tombs were the treas- 
uries of Atreus and his sons, and that within the Acrop- 
olis were buried Atreus and Electra, with Agamemnon 
and his followers, foully done to death by .^Egisthus and 
Clytemnestra." 

The chapter devoted to Tiryns is an excellent 
piece of topographical description, and leaves 
the careful reader in complete possession of the 
latest and best-considered opinions as to the 
position and probable use of every wall, cham- 
ber, and gallery on that ancient ridge of lime- 
stone. The distinction between " Cyclopean," 



"polygonal," and rectangular masonry is well 
brought out and made clear to the layman, who 
may have confused the first two of these with 
each other. Cyclopean structure means " huge 
masses of rock, either unwrought or roughly 
dressed with the hammer and piled one upon 
another, not quite irregularly, as has been held, 
but with an effort at horizontal jointing and 
with the use of clay mortar (now mostly washed 
out) as a bedding material. . . . Polygonal 
masonry employs stones carefully hewn into 
polygons with unequal sides, and so closely 
joined together that there are no gaps and con- 
sequently no bonding with small stones or mor- 
tar." The rectangular order is too familiar to 
need description, having persisted in all subse- 
quent architecture. Curiously enough, however, 
our authors affirm, apparently with reason, that 
this form of structure at Tiryns and Mycenae 
was earlier than the polygonal, and assign to 
the famous " polygonal tower " a date not long 
before the destruction of Mycenae by the Ar- 
gives in 468 B. C. 

The book is lavishly illustrated with maps, 
plans, and pictures ; the covers being peculiarly 
enriched with gilt embossed bands reproducing 
the superb goldsmith's work on the Vaphio cups 
found by Dr. Tsountas in 1889. The illustra- 
tions, as a whole, do not reach the standard of 
clear-cut precision set by Schuchhardt's book 
mentioned above, comparison with which is 
inevitable. A notable exception must be made 
in the case of the five fine plates from photo- 
graphs by Professor Colwell, of Denison Uni- 
versity. 

A number of slips in the proof-reading, and 
some items of latest information prepared after 
the rest of the book had been printed, are noted 
in two pages of " addenda et corrigenda." Be- 
sides these, we may call attention to the sen- 
tence (on page 145), " At either hand lay two 
more cups, one of silver and one of gold ; the 
latter are the now famous Vaphio cups," etc., 
where the word " pair " would seem necessary 
after " one." JOSIAH RENICK SMITH.

THE BIOLOGICAL, PROBLEM OF TO-DAY.* 



The translation of Prof. Oscar Hertwig's 
essay, " Preformation oder Epigenese ? " which 
has been published under the title " The Bio- 
logical Problem of To-day," may perhaps serve 
a useful purpose. One of the most remarkable 
features of certain writings which have ap- 
peared in the last few years has been their un- 
hesitating acceptance of Weismann's captivat- 
ing speculations. Weismannism in its crudest 
and most uncompromising form has run riot 
in the pages of reviews and even of text-books. 
Some of the votaries of sociology that sci- 
ence which Mr. Leslie Stephens characterizes as 
" a very vague body of approximate truths " 
have built up imposing structures on the sup- 
posedly established facts of biology. The ingen- 
iously simple hypotheses of the prophet are 
taken as the very flower and fruit of biological 
wisdom. If one takes as foundation (pace 
Mr. Kidd) "this conclusion which biology is 
now approaching," a very pretty edifice may 
doubtless be erected. Should Hertwig's notable 
essay lead some of these authors, dutifully am- 
bitious to embody in their writings the " latest 
biological thought," to realize that Weismann's 
notions of development and heredity, stimulat- 
ing though they have been, are yet based largely 
on a foundation of unverified and unverifiable 
hypotheses, it will not have been in vain. 

The question of the development of the indi- 
vidual from the egg may well be regarded not 
only as the problem of to-day, but as the prob- 
lem of the past and the future. The particular 
phase of the question considered in Hertwig's 
essay was also the subject of the life-long labors 
of the Genevan naturalist Bonnet, more than a 
hundred years ago. Does the adult organism 
exist ready-made in the egg or " germ," or does 
it develope by a process of new formation (epi- 
genesis) ? Bonnet, as is well known, was the 
untiring advocate of the preformation theory. 
The consequences arising from thus picturing 
the adult as already formed in miniature in the 
germ, and as developing by means of a simple 
" swelling-up " of parts, were unflinchingly met 
by Bonnet and carried to their logical conclu- 
sion. Hertwig sees in the Weismannian doc- 
trine of determinants a return to the preform- 
ationist standpoint of Bonnet. If it be true that 
the difference in the various cells of the body, 
muscle-cells, nerve-cells, etc., is due to differ-

or Epigenesis ? By Prof. Dr. Oscar Hertwig ; translated by 
P. Chalmers Mitchell, M.A. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



ence in the structure of certain units, the deter- 
minants, the similarity of the new and old doc- 
trines is apparent. " It would be impossible," 
says Weismann, " for any small portion of the 
human skin to undergo a hereditary and inde- 
pendent change from the germ onwards, unless 
a small vital element corresponding to this par- 
ticular part of the skin existed in the germ 
substance, a variation in this element causing a 
corresponding variation in the part concerned. 
Were this not the case, birthmarks would not 
exist." 

Hertwig attacks this position, which he re- 
gards as the position of the preformationists of 
the last century " slightly altered." Two of 
Weismann's interesting assumptions first, 
the distinction between an Erbgleiche Theilung 
(translated doubling division) and an Erbun- 
gleicJie Theilung (differentiating division), and 
second, the sharp contrast which Weismann 
claims to exist between body-plasm and germ- 
plasm are brushed aside by Hertwig. An 
adult organism arises from a single cell, the 
egg or germ, by a process of repeated division 
and subdivision of the protoplasm of the egg- 
cell. On Weismann's hypothesis the division 
is at first " doubling," afterwards " differentiat- 
ing." The germ protoplasm remains passive, 
undeveloped, undifferentiated, and is handed on 
by doubling division unchanged from 
parent to offspring; the somatic protoplasm 
undergoes active differentiation and develop- 
ment, and the elements composing it (deter- 
minants) are sorted out, by differentiating 
division, into appropriate groups of cells, each 
with its predetermined destination in the adult 
soma. To this Hertwig replies : " Cells mul- 
tiply only by doubling division. Between so- 
matic cells and reproductive cells there is no 
strong contrast, no gulf that cannot be bridged " 
(page 84). 

Against the specific doctrine of determinants, 
Hertwig argues strenuously. He neatly turns 
the tables on the sociologists by inserting the 
famous social organism comparison. 

" The human state may be conceived as a high and 
compound organism that, by the union of many individ- 
uals, and by their division into classes with different 
functions, has developed into a form always becoming 
more complicated. ... As the state develops, urban 
and district communities, unions for husbandry and man- 
ufactures, colleges of physicians, parliaments, ministries, 
armies, and so forth, appear. All this visible complexity 
depends upon individuals associated for definite pur- 
poses and specialized in different directions. It would 
certainly not occur to anyone to explain the growth of 
this complexity in the developing state by the assump- 
tion that this secondary complexity was preformed as

definite material particles present in the first pair, 
although the first pair is the rudiment of the whole. 
. . . But what applies to the causal relations between 
the state organism and men applies also, ceteris paribus, 
to the explanation of the causal relations between the 
rudiments in the egg and the organism to which the 
egg gives rise " (pp. 91, 92). 

Hertwig's own view, which he regards as or- 
thodox epigenesis, is stated in similar terms. 

" Culture and civilization are the wonderfully com- 
plicated results of the cooperation of many individuals 
united in society. By the manifolding of their relations 
and their combinations, men in society have brought 
about a higher complexity than man, left by himself, 
ever would have been able to develop from his own 
individual properties a complexity that has arisen by 
the interaction of the same characters of many men in 
cooperation. Similarly, the activity of the egg in growth 
and cell-formation is an inexhaustible source of new 
complexity; for the self-multiplying systems of units 
always binding themselves into higher complexes, con- 
tinually enter into new interrelations, and afford the 
opportunity for new combinations of forces in fact, 
of new characters." 

And again : 

" Thus, during the course of development, they are 
forces external to the cells that bid them assume the 
individual characters appropriate to their individual re- 
lations to the whole; the determining forces are not 
within the cells, as the doctrine of determinants sup- 
poses. The cells develop those characters that are sug- 
gested by their relation to the external world and their 
places in the whole organism. ... In my theory two 
assumptions of totally contrasting nature are made: I 
assume a germ-plasm of high and specific organization, 
and I assume that this is transformed into the adult 
product by epigenetic agencies " (pp. 136, 138). 

This last remark plays directly into the hands 
of the enemy. Mr. Herbert Spencer, although 
equally with Hertwig an opponent of Weis- 
mannism, has noticed the incongruity : 

" To this it may be replied that the ability to form 
the appropriate cell-complexes, itself depends upon the 
constitutional units contained in the cells." 

It may well be questioned whether Hertwig 
in this essay does not show to better advantage 
as critic of Weismann's hypotheses than as 
architect of his own. It has been found easier 
to point out the faulty architectonics of Weis- 
mann's unsteady structure than to figure a sat- 
isfactory fa$ade to his own conception. 

The translation, as might be gathered from 
the examples given, is not mellifluous, but that 
perhaps should not be demanded. It is accu- 
rate and fairly smooth, though with too many 
inversions. The troublesome word Anlage is 
" rudiment " for this translator, which is at 
least better than " fundament." On page 12 
the translator leaves undisturbed a beautiful 
juxtaposition of metaphorical pillows, bricks, 
and cobwebs. EDWIN O. JORDAN. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



Mr. Hardy's new novel is not strictly new, for it 
was published serially several years ago. It seems, 
however, to have made little impression at the time, 
and there is no doubt that before the appearance of 
"Teas " and " Jude " the author had much less vogue 
than has since been given him by those extraordi- 
nary books. We could wish, indeed, that " The Well- 
Beloved" were a recently- written book, for it would 
represent a reaction from the mood of cynical bit- 
terness that has been upon Mr. Hardy of late, and 
all lovers of good literature would rejoice to learn 
that the "blue devils" had been exorcised, and to 
find the novelist of " Far from the Madding Crowd " 
and " A Pair of Blue Eyes " restored to them. Such 
a " return of the native " to his old-time scenes and

themes would be welcome indeed, as we feel over 
and over again in reading this old book that we 
should be glad to think a new one. Mr. Hardy is 
well-advised to describe the book as "a sketch of a 
temperament," for it is distinctly a temperament 
and not a character that is presented under the name 
of Jocelyn Pierston. He is a man who all his life 
long is in love with love rather than with any partic- 
ular woman, and " the well-beloved " is his name 
for a sort of Platonic idea that assumes one embodi- 
ment after another, for an elusive ideal which is the 
permanent element in many fleeting forms. " Each 
individuality known as Lucy, Jane, Flora, Evange- 
line, or what-not, had been merely a transient con- 
dition of her. He did not recognize this as an excuse 
or as a defence, but as a fact simply. Essentially 
she was perhaps of no tangible substance ; a spirit, 
a dream, a frenzy, a conception, an aroma, an epi- 
tomized sex, a light of the eye, a parting of the lips. 
God only knew what she really was ; Pierston did 
not. She was indescribable." To the hard-headed 
reader, this may seem nothing more than a fine-spun 
theory, a sophistical way of describing the natural 
fickleness of the homme sensuel moyen. But there 
is a difference, and this difference is so entirely of 
the essence of Mr. Hardy's story that a failure to 
comprehend it is a failure to get the author's point 
of view, a failure to see anything at all worth seeing 
in his book. To begin with, Pierston is not a sen- 
sual man ; we are told distinctly that he had never 
wronged one of the many women in whose forms 
the migratory well-beloved had taken up a tempo- 
rary abode. To call him a nympholept, as one critic 
has done, is to exaggerate unduly the sensual ele- 
ment in a passion that is presented to us as almost 
purely a matter of the intellect, and that should 
rather be taken as akin to the rapture of artistic 
contemplation. The real key to the problem of this 
temperament is to be sought elsewhere, and is sug- 
gested by the author himself in an apt quotation 
from Tennyson's " Tithonus." To project the fresh- 
ness of youthful feeling into the years of ripeness 
is given to but few, and the possibility of such a 
consummation has much that is alluring. But the 
tragic aspect of the matter is not wanting, as we 
are taught by the example of " this gray shadow 
once a man," enamored at the age of sixty with the 
grandchild of the woman whom he had loved when 
he was twenty. The bare outline of Pierston's story 
is that he loves successively, at intervals of twenty 
years, three girls who represent three generations of 
the family with which his own fate seems to be 
linked. One might think that there was stuff for 
comedy in this situation ; but Mr. Hardy will not 
have it so, and it is a signal triumph of his art that 
the reader is not moved to mirth as the tale unfolds. 
A year or two ago the author of " The Green Carna- 
tion" seemed to be distinctly a man of promise. The 
short stories and the half-grown novel that followed 
that amusing skit bore out the promise to a certain 
extent, revealing descriptive and imaginative powers 
somewhat out of the common, and a marked talent 



for the impressive treatment of weird or horrible 
themes. That the author took himself seriously is 
now made evident by the publication of " Flames," 
a novel that extends to over five hundred pages. It 
is clear that the ability of Mr. Hichens is not com- 
mensurate with his ambition. He has sought after 
the kind of triumph that Bulwer's " A Strange 
Story " exemplifies ; he has attained a triumph that 
would be about worthy of Miss Corelli. In con- 
tent, this novel tells of a mysterious transfer of souls 
from body to body ; in form, it is a dreary waste of 
pretentious verbiage ; in spirit and conception, it 
represents the most corrupt type of decadent litera- 
ture. It is impossible to have any patience with 
its flaunting indecencies, or any sort of sympathy 
with the neurotic individuals who figure in its pages. 
Its whole view of life is morbid, its sentiment maud- 
lin, its fundamental idea impossible, and its tone 
disgusting. 

We are inclined to think " Phroso " the best 
novel, considered simply as a story of adventure, 
that " Anthony Hope " has published since " The 
Prisoner of Zenda" took the reading public by 
storm. There is perhaps better literature in some 
of his other books, more analysis, delicate comedy, 
and the like; but for romantic and adventurous 
interest, this latest novel must take high rank. The 
very suggestion of the isles of Greece is fascinating, 
and when we learn that the English hero is about 
to take possession of one of them, our hopes rise 
high. Nor are they disappointed by the outcome ; 
for the isle in question turns out to be, as someone 
suggests early in the narrative, " a very conserva- 
tive part of the world," and our hero and his com- 
panions seem to have reached a complete impasse 
when they find themselves in their new castle, sur- 
rounded by a mob of islanders howling for their 
lives. But the inventions of the romantic novelist 
are many, and seeming defeat is at the end trans- 
formed into victory. The heroine, whose name is 
short for Euphrosyne, is a very engaging product 
of an unsophisticated race, so charming, in fact, 
that the point of honor seems a little strained that 
so long prevents the hero from renouncing the En- 
glish girl to whom he is betrothed, and in whom we 
are evidently not expected to take the least interest, 
even at the outset. The book illustrates the pecu- 
liar exigencies of serial publication, and is, in that 
respect, defective when taken as a whole. 

A stirring romance of the seventeenth century 
Netherlands is "The Master -Beggars," by Mr. 
L. Cope Cornford. Its theme is found, as the title 
indicates, in those guerrilla bands that made so much 
trouble for Alva, and that accepted as a badge of 
honor the title derisively bestowed upon them by 
their enemies. Mr. Cornford himself happily de- 
scribes his book as " a tale of old time ; wherein the 
scenes are laid, and the persons of the legend pursue 
their affairs, in that foreign country of rich plains 
and shining water, usurped from the waste kingdom 
of the sea and sown with monumental cities, which 
you know : a land so eloquent of calamitous genera-

tions, and ancient, bloody wars long since composed, 
that, were no histories extant, written (according to 
the vaunt of the knightly chronicler) for princes 
and persons of quality, a man could surely trace the 
footprints of the dead, and go to and fro, and sleep, 
and wake to find their story in his heart." The 
reader will surely find this story in his heart long 
after he has laid it aside, for it is vivid, dramatic, 
and forceful, full of the stuff of genuine romance, 
and made tender by the golden thread of a love- 
story. The hero, a monk turned soldier, and the 
heroine, a lady of high degree, are singularly engag- 
ing characters ; and the rugged figure of the Wild 
Cat, the " beggar " chieftain, evokes sympathy and 
admiration up to the very hour of his heroic death, 
which somehow recalls the death of Hereward in 
Kingsley's magnificent romance. 

The tide of English historical fiction continues as 
swollen as ever, and several recent productions in 
this field deserve to be mentioned here. "A Pearl 
of the Realm " is by a new writer, Miss Anna L. 
Glyn, and dates from the period of the Civil War 
in England. It is not a strong or vivid piece of 
work, but it has a very winsome heroine, and the 
narrative flows smoothly and pleasantly along to its 
happy conclusion. It is, moreover, exceptionally 
accurate in its history and topography, and alto- 
gether a satisfactory piece of work. 

"A Woman's Courier," also by a new writer, has 
for its subject the conspiracy of 1696 against the 
life of the King. It is told in reminiscent vein 
by an old man whose youth was passed among the 
stirring scenes that filled the years just following 
the Revolution. It is mainly a story of adventure 
and intrigue, with enough love-interest to give the 
needed infusion of sentiment. The narrative is 
clean-cut, and the interest is never allowed to flag. 

" For the White Rose of Arno," Mr. Owen Rhos- 
comyl's new romance, is anything but clean-cut, and 
we follow its course with considerable difficulty. We 
have previously spoken of the dense quality which 
serves to obscure the undoubted merits of this nov- 
elist ; and the defect is still as noteworthy as ever. 
This story of " the Forty-five " has dramatic vigor, 
romantic atmosphere, and a fine Welsh flavor. Its 
sympathies are distinctly with the cause of the Pre- 
tender, and it is evident that the author would gladly 
have chronicled, did history permit, a success of the 
Stuart arms at Culloden. 

The story of " The Last Recruit of Clare's " is 
described as " being passages from the memoirs of 
Anthony Dillon, Chevalier of St. Louis, and late 
Colonel of Clare's Regiment in the service of 
France." The time is that of Fontenoy ; and the 
author is Mr. S. R. Keightley, two of whose histor- 
ical novels were recently reviewed in these columns. 
The book presents a series of detached episodes 
rather than a continuous narrative, but is highly 
interesting for all that, and helps to strengthen our 
earlier conclusion that the author is quite the equal 
of Mr. Weyman as a master of historical romance. 

Miss Olive Schreiner's recent contribution to the 



literature of South African affairs has the form of 
fiction, but is in reality a tract undisguised. The 
greater part of it is a dialogue between a young 
English trooper in the service of the Chartered 
Company and a mysterious stranger who appears 
by his camp-fire one night when the trooper has lost 
his way on the veld. It is a little startling to realize 
that the stranger is no other than the Founder of the 
Christian religion ; but there is no touch of irrever- 
ence in the author's design, and the conversation 
that ensues brings into striking contrast the two 
points of view of modern colonial enterprise and of 
fundamental ethics. Were it not for the prophetic 
earnestness of the stranger's discourse, we might 
take him to be the Altrurian discovered by our 
friend Mr. Howells, and made to point, although in 
other social spheres, absolute morals of much the 
same sort. Of the entire sincerity of Miss Schrein- 
er's attitude there can be no doubt ; but the book is 
too surcharged with emotion to prove very convinc- 
ing to a logical mind, and her abhorrence of both 
Mr. Rhodes and the methods of the British South 
African Company has led her to a one-sided pre- 
sentment of the situation. That the book has a cer- 
tain power is not to be denied ; it might almost have 
been written by Count Tolstoy, so simply confident 
and uncompromising is its stand on the side of what 
its author conceives to be the purest essence of 
Christian teaching. Yet it seems to us on the whole 
ineffectual, because its protest is not so much against 
the perversities of men as against the forces of 
nature herself. 

"A Pinchbeck Goddess " will attract readers be- 
cause it is written by a sister of Mr. Rudyard Kip- 
ling ; were it not for this adventitious commendation, 
a story so feebly conventional would hardly call for 
mention. It is a narrative of Anglo-Indian society, 
and the characters chatter interminably without de- 
veloping into anything interesting. The metamor- 
phosis of the shy and morbid girl who figures in the 
opening chapters into the dashing heroine of the 
rest of the book is so untrue to the possibilities of 
human nature that we can have little patience with 
the writer who relies upon so cheap a trick for the 
main interest of her story. 

It is only fair to the novel-reader to inform him, 
before saying anything further about " En Route," 
just translated from the French of M. J.-K. Huys- 
mans, that the claim of the book to be classed among 
works of fiction is of the most tenuous sort. It is 
really a religious tract undisguised, being the second 
part of the trilogy begun with " La-bas " and ended 
with " La Cathe'drale." The purpose of the entire 
work is to analyze the soul of a sensualist, and to 
describe the process of his conversion from the life 
of corruption to the life (or living death) of spiritual 
contemplation. Mr. C. Kegan Paul, who has trans- 
lated this book, takes it very seriously indeed, as his 
preface indicates ; and there is no doubt that it is a 
powerful piece of analysis, however morbid and 
perverse in both conception and method. But the 
artificial, almost mechanical, ministry that it brings

the mind diseased, is, to our thinking, about as far 
removed as anything well can be from a truly re- 
generative discipline. Church architecture, and 
sacred music, and the ritual of worship, and the reg- 
imen of the monastic life, are all vastly interesting 
subjects of study, but they are, after all, the trap- 
pings of religion, and not, as M. Huysmans would 
have us think, of its very essence. Upon all these 
subjects, the book displays much curious erudition, 
besides portraying a temperament that is an inter- 
esting object of study, but that is not, we feel bound 
to say, a normal type in any civilized community. 

The latest novel of Mr. Jokai to be translated 
into English is called " The Green Book," and is 
based upon the Russian revolutionary movement of 
1825. Like all of this versatile author's books, this 
novel is extremely animated, and crammed with 
picturesque incidents that throw probability to the 
winds ; like most of them, also, it is shapeless and 
incoherent, bewildering the reader by its unexpected 
windings, and dazing him with its harshly-contrasted 
colors. It gives us full-length portraits of Alexan- 
der I. and the poet Pushkin, and outline sketches of 
other historical figures. The translation, we regret 
to say, is very badly done. It seems to have been 
made from some other language than the original 
(probably from the German), and the Russian 
proper names, after their triple metamorphosis, 
emerge in singular shapes so singular that they 
are difficult of identification. 

Turning now to the latest productions of Amer- 
ican fiction, it seems in every way proper that " The 
Choir Invisible " should be given the place of honor. 
Looking about among our younger men of letters 
for the promise of some new and vital impulse, it 
has for several years seemed to us that such an im- 
pulse might be expected to come from the work of 
Mr. James Lane Allen. He has published few 
books as yet, but the number is sufficient to reveal 
a steadily increasing mastery of his art, and the 
quality such as to warrant readers of discernment 
in predicting for him a brilliant career and an as- 
sured place in the front rank of American writers. 
" The Choir Invisible " does not disappoint these 
expectations. It is not only the most ambitious of 
Mr. Allen's books, considered merely as to its scale, 
but it is also the one in which he has carried to the 
highest pitch that fineness of perception and that 
distinction of manner that have from the first set 
his work apart from the work of nearly all of his 
contemporaries. Hardly since Hawthorne have we 
had such pages as the best of these ; hardly since 
" The Scarlet Letter " and " The Marble Faun " 
have we had fictive work so spiritual in essence and 
adorned with such delicate and lovely embroiderings 
of the imagination. There are descriptive passages 
so exquisitely wrought that the reader lingers over 
them to make them a possession forever ; there are 
inner experiences so intensely realized that they be- 
come a part of the life of his own soul. The mere story 
of " The Choir Invisible " is no great thing, but we 
do not read such a book for its plot. The scene is 



laid in Kentucky, the year is 1795. We read of a 
man who loves a gay and shallow village beauty, is 
separated from her by a series of petty misunder- 
standings, and afterwards learns the real meaning 
of love from the companionship of a noble-hearted 
woman several years his senior. The passion is 
hopeless, for she is already bound by the ties of a 
loveless marriage, and the inborn strength of the 
man comes out in the struggle of renunciation. A 
word must be said of the book Malory's " Morte 
d'Arthure " which helps the hero in his deep 
trouble, or rather a word of the part played by that 
noble chronicle of heroic deeds born of high ideals 
in bringing him to a realization of his better self 
and in teaching him how men are made strong 
through suffering. No finer tribute has ever been 
paid to this " old Bible of manhood " than is 
afforded by this study of its restraining and ennob- 
ling power. There are many other things in Mr. 
Allen's novel that deserve mention ; such, for ex- 
ample, as its deep feeling for the epic of the pio- 
neer, the historical vistas that it opens to the view, 
the tenderness and the grace of its reflective pas- 
sages, the fine idealism that is never missing from 
its pages. It might, indeed, be urged that many of 
the pages belong to essay-writing rather than to 
creative art, and one must reluctantly allow that the 
interests of the individual characters concerned are 
at times so merged in the larger interests of an ab- 
stract humanity that we forget about the story. But 
this defect in the book, considered merely as fiction, 
makes it all the better literature, for literature it is 
in a sense that lifts it far above the level of stories 
that entertain for the hour and are then forgotten. 

" The Landlord at Lion's Head," the latest novel 
by Mr. Howells, must be reckoned among his com- 
parative failures. It is inordinately long for the 
modicum of interest attaching to its plot and to the 
characters with whose fortunes it deals. The study 
of the principal figure, although faithfully pursued 
through a maze of incident and delineative de- 
tail, is on the whole indeterminate and unconvinc- 
ing ; it comes out in a certain way, but the reader 
feels that it might just about as easily have been 
made to come out in an an entirely different 
way. The other characters are as nearly lay fig- 
ures as it is possible for Mr. Howells to draw, for 
his poorest sketches cannot help having a certain 
sharpness of outline, resulting from his trick of 
shrewd minute observation. Of course there are 
pages, and whole episodes, in this book that reveal 
the work of a master-hand, and of course the book 
as a whole is a "document" wherein the future 
historian of New England society may delve with 
the certainty of reward. But it is not altogether 
worthy of its author, from whom we have a right to 
expect as much as from any other American novelist 
now living. 

The anonymous author of " The Descendant " is 
unduly oppressed with the doctrine of heredity. His 
thesis seems to be that the invidious bar of birth 
lies athwart the best intentions and the most reso-

lute character, shaping the life in spite of itself. 
This thesis is worked out in the character of a man 
whose childhood has been hopelessly embittered by 
the slurs cast upon it on account of illegitimacy, 
who leaves his country home for the city, who 
throws his whole energy into journalism of a radi- 
cally socialistic and destructive type, who wins only 
to scorn the love of the woman who might have 
saved him, and whose maturer realization of the 
folly of his course results only in a fit of passion 
that makes him a murderer and lands him in a 
felon's cell. The book is undeniably strong, and 
rises to the height of genuine passion in its climac- 
teric scenes ; but it is crude in the working-out of 
many of its episodes, and is rather suggestive of 
future possibilities than the earnest of achieved 
mastery. 

Mr. Robert Herrick, in " The Man Who Wins," 
also sounds the note of heredity in a somewhat 
insistent fashion, rapidly sketching the history 
through several generations of a New England 
family of Puritan stock. The outline is truthful 
enough, for many a New England race has gone into 
just such a decline as is here held up for our edifi- 
cation, and nothing is more common than to find 
the austere self -repression of the ancestor counter- 
vailed by the reckless excesses of the descendant. It 
is simply a way that Nature has of making up her 
balances. And this moral and physical degenera- 
tion brings down not only the family type, but also 
drags into its current, through the agency of pas- 
sion, the representatives of stronger strains. The 
principal character in Mr. Herrick's little book is a 
man of great capabilities, who marries into a failing 
family of the sort indicated, and renounces for the 
sake of love the career that he has marked out for 
himself. He is successful as the world views success, 
but the world sees nothing of the inner tragedy of his 
career. In the closing pages a new generation ap- 
pears upon the scene, and the man who feels that 
the better part of his own life has been arrested in 
its development saves from a similar fate the youth 
who is a suitor for his daughter's hand. " The 
man who wins does not devote his life to an exact- 
ing passion for a neurotic woman." This is the 
key-note of the story, which has a certain sombre 
strength, which is told in terse straightforward En- 
glish, and which exhibits both finish and restraint. 

Probably no such vivid and realistic description 
of the life of the sailor has been given to the public 
since " Two Years before the Mast " than is to be 
found in the recently-published book called " On 
Many Seas." It is essentially autobiography rather 
than fiction, and is mentioned here only because it 
has all the entertaining qualities of an invented 
story, although supplemented by touches such as 
must always be beyond the reach of mere invention. 
" Frederick Benton Williams " is the name given 
upon the title-page, but we understand that Mr. 
Herbert Hamblen is the real name of the author. 
The ten years or more of voyages described are quite 
literally " on many seas," and the work goes far 



beyond Dana's classic narrative in the scope and 
variety of the experiences recorded. The chief 
charm of the book lies in its unpretentious language ; 
things are described exactly as they are recalled, 
and there is not the slightest effort to veneer them 
with any kind of "style." Although the period 
concerned is more than a generation later than that 
dealt with by Dana, the life described is one of at 
least equal hardship and perhaps even more sicken- 
ing brutality. Only the hall-mark of truth saves 
many of the chapters from sheer repulsiveness. But 
it is pleasant to think that America can produce 
men with constitutions capable of surviving such 
conditions as are here relentlessly depicted, and 
with sufficient optimism to write about them in so 
unvariably cheerful a strain. 

" The Great K. & A. Train Robbery " is, as the 
author calls it, nothing more than a " skit," and it 
would not be fair to base upon it any estimate of 
Mr. Ford's work. What he can do as a serious 
novelist is shown by that remarkable book, " The 
Honorable Peter Stirling," as well as by the serial 
now running in the pages of " The Atlantic 
Monthly." But we may say of his story of the 
train robbery that it is good literature of its kind, 
with skilful construction, exciting incident, pleasing 
dialogue, and the expectedly happy outcome. 

" The Spoils of Poynton " consist of the " objects 
of bigotry and virtue " with which Mrs. Gereth, an 
ardent collector, has in the course of many years 
brought together for the adornment of her English 
home. Upon the sad event that leaves Mrs. Gereth 
a widow, the house and its belongings revert to her 
son, who knows nothing about bric-a-brac. Pres- 
ently this son becomes enamoured of a very vulgar 
young woman, as incapable as he is of realizing 
what a dream of beauty Poynton has been made by 
its furnishings, but nevertheless determined to have 
them all, and to dispossess their collector. The 
heart-broken Mrs. Gereth thereupon resorts to the 
desperate measure of conveying the things surrep- 
titiously away to the cottage provided for her future 
residence. Threatened with legal process, she still 
refuses to give them up, but at last restores them in 
the belief that her son will renounce the young 
woman in question, and marry another who has the 
virtue of artistic appreciation, to say nothing of 
many others. In a well-regulated novel, this is ex- 
actly what would have happened ; but both the 
young man and the desirable young woman carry 
their notions of honor to the extreme of quixotism, 
and in the end the mother is left destitute of all 
that she most prizes, the son is mated to the woman 
whom he does not love, and the other woman, whom 
he has at last learned to love, has only the bitter 
satisfaction that her excess of scrupulosity has set- 
tled everything awry. This is the substance of the 
latest novel by Mr. Henry James, which is, of 
course, written with the most delicate literary art, 
but which remains about as cold-blooded and unat- 
tractive as it is possible for a work of fiction to be. 

Dr. Abbott is a charming naturalist, but his gifts

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



as a story-teller are more questionable. There is 
excellent stuff in his unpretentious tale of the days 
" When the Century Was New," but the hand that 
deals with it is not enough practised in romance to 
make the most of his opportunities, or to keep his 
threads from getting tangled in the weaving. The 
situation set forth is as puzzling as a problem in 
chess ; and when the final clearing-up comes, one 
still has to think out a good many things for him- 
self, which is annoying. 

It is pleasant to be reminded that such writers of 
accomplished achievement as Mrs. Harriet Prescott 
Spofford and Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis are still 
in the active ranks, and have lost nothing of their 
early powers. Each of these women has recently 
given us a new story, and embodied anew some of 
the older and better ideals of American fiction. 
"An Inheritance," by Mrs. Spofford, has both sweet- 
ness and strength, and shows that an island home 
in the Merrimac is still as good a vantage-ground 
as any for the observation of life. The story has, 
indeed, the fault of being half-completed before it 
begins ; that is, more than half of the pages are em- 
ployed to bring the lives of the characters concerned 
down to the date at which they appear upon the 
actual scene. 

" Frances Waldeaux," by Mrs. Davis, is the story 
of a woman and her son. Incidentally, it is also the 
story of two other women, one a foreign adventuress, 
the other an American girl. The hero meets the ad- 
venturess on a transatlantic steamer, and marries 
her, in brutal disregard of the wishes of his mother, 
to whom he has more than ordinary reasons for being 
grateful. The son and the mother separate ; and 
a year or so later, the mother, half-frenzied by her 
sufferings, makes an attempt, happily unsuccessful, 
upon the life of the woman who has wronged her. 
The latter dies soon thereafter, and the husband 
returns to America with his mother, having lost a 
good many of the illusions of youth. In the end he 
marries the American girl who has loved him all 
the time. This brief outline can give but a slight 
idea of what is an exceptionally strong piece of lit- 
erary work. There are some unnatural things about 
it, but the reader is carried over them by the rapid 
sweep of the narrative. Among the minor figures, 
that of the fortune-hunting German princeling is 
particularly successful ; and the moral of interna- 
tional marriages is very explicitly set forth. 

Mrs. Sullivan's story of " A Questionable Mar- 
riage " is told with more of didactic purpose than of 
literary art. Its aim is to call attention, by means 
of a concrete and very painful instance, to the 
chaotic condition of American divorce legislation. 
The instance is supplied by a decree of the Okla- 
homa courts, dated 1894, which nullified all divorces 
granted within that territory during the preceding 
year. The heroine of the story is a woman who has 
freed herself from a brutal husband by means of 
such a divorce, and who has married again before 
its annullment by the decision in question. It is evi- 
dent that the author has taken her subject deeply 



to heart (as who familiar with the facts has not?), 
but her attitude toward the whole question of divorce 
seems to be one of hesitancy between the civil and 
the sacramental views of marriage. 

There is a marked similarity between the two 
novels that have been left to close this review. It 
is not merely that both are the work of women, and 
replete with a peculiarly feminine form of sentiment, 
but that their plots, barring accidents of time and 
place, are essentially the same. In each there is a 
high-minded heroine, sought after by two men, and 
in each is the worthy lover cast aside through the 
treachery of the unworthy one, learning the truth 
only after an unfortunate marriage has made it 
impossible to set matters right. In each, also, the 
wife has an hour of passionate self-abandonment, fol- 
lowed by a revulsion of feeling when duty once more 
resumes her sway. Miss Litchfield's " In the Cru- 
cible " is a novel of Washington society, which is 
evidently to her a very familiar subject. The book 
has many charming episodes, and is informed 
throughout by a spirit of fine idealism that stands 
in grateful contrast to the spirit in which most con- 
temporary novels are conceived. " A Transatlantic 
Chatelaine " is the second novel that Miss Prince 
has written, and, like its predecessor, the scene is 
laid in provincial France. It is always refreshing 
to get such glimpses of the real life of the French 
people, and they are not to be got by the most assidu- 
ous student of the French novelists chiefly in vogue. 
The author of the present work knows her subject 
au fond, and writes of it with such grace and sym- 
pathy as to win the affections as well as the interest 
of her readers. WILLIAM MOBTON PAYNE.

The sex idea 
in religion. 



The scope and argument of Mrs. 
Eliza Burt Gamble's work entitled 
"The God-Idea of the Ancients" 
(Putnam) are better defined by its alternate title, 
" Sex in Religion." Mrs. Gamble has brought to- 
gether a great amount of material, drawn chiefly 
from Furlong's " Rivers of Life," Faber's " Pagan 
Idolatry," Inman's "Ancient Faiths," " Isis Un- 
veiled," etc. For those acquainted with these works, 
little comment is needed ; to others it may be stated 
that the work before us deals largely with the wor- 
ship of trees, fire, water, and the phallus. The au- 
thor's views regarding the " Evolution of Woman " 
are fundamental to this work. Just as Mrs. Gamble 
believes that woman in primitive times was socially 
and intellectually man's superior, so she also believes 
that in early religion the female idea in deity was 
supreme. It was only when, in his selfish might, 
man encroached socially upon woman's domain, 
that the old and beautiful religion of adoration of 
the universal mother gave way. In tree, phallic, 
and water worship, we have fragments pointing back 
to the olden happier condition. Mrs. Gamble hates

the Jews, with their male presumption ; she deals 
ungently with Christianity, which to her is a decep- 
tion of the priests, while Christ himself is Crishna, 
a sun-god. Both Christ and Crishna are male 
supplanters of an early feminine solar deity. That 
our author is in earnest, no one can doubt. She is 
not altogether happy, however, in her selection of 
authorities, and not at all critical in her use of ma- 
terial. What she presents may be worth examina- 
tion, but it does not carry conviction. There are 
still some peoples who, if not really in the matriar- 
chote, are not far removed from it. Among them 
are most of our American Indians. Their religion 
is the nature-worship which Mrs. Gamble so much 
admires. Yet in it the female is not supreme. That 
the fundamental idea in it is reproduction, that the 
symbolism is sexual, all this is true. But the ideas 
are all bisexual. The male sun and the mother 
earth combine to produce. Similarly, where other 
nature forces are the agents in creation, reciprocal 
principles are found. Nowhere is the idea of the 
female producing alone conspicuous. The virgin 
mother is an after-thought, not primitive. Every 
illustration the author gives comes from adult re- 
ligions, among civilized populations, and not from 
primitive religious thought. In connection with 
native American religions one other point may be 
mentioned : While in society the woman prevails, in 
religion the female is distinctly subordinate. In 
many ceremonials she is absent ; in others, though 
present, she takes an inferior position. Yet all this 
is against Mrs. Gamble's contention. According to 
her view, the feminine divinity is dethroned or re- 
placed by a male, because in society the man is 
encroaching. The social slavery precedes the relig- 
ious revolt. The facts point in another direction. 
Mrs. Gamble's book is interesting as an example of 
curious reasoning ; but it has little other value. 

After all, there is a great difference 
. between the raw materials for a novel 

and the finished product as turned 
over to us by a master workman. Mr. Lang tells 
us in the preface to " Pickle the Spy " (Longmans) 
that what he here publishes was to have been used 
by Mr. Stevenson as the basis of a novel ; and one of 
the sources of interest in the volume will be the con- 
jecture of what he would have done with it. From 
hitherto unpublished papers in the British Museum 
and in the Stuart Collection at Windsor, Mr. Lang 
solves two riddles in the minor annals of the eigh- 
teenth century : the whereabouts of Prince Charles 
Edward from 1749 to 1751, and the identity of a 
special agent of the Pelham government hitherto 
known as Pickle. To frame these revelations he gives 
a tolerable complete account of the Young Pretender 
down to the death of his father, James III., and a 
sketch of Alexander (Alastair) Ruadh MacDonnell 
of Glengarry, especially his later years, during 
which, according to Mr. Lang, he was playing the 
double role of devoted Jacobite and of Pickle the 
British spy. "Young Glengarry," as he called him- 



self, was a " cool, good-humoured, smiling, unscru- 
pulous villain," a " scoundrel happily unconscious of 
his own unspeakable infamy, proud and sensitive 
upon the point of honour," a " picturesque hypocrite 
in religion." Although Mr. Lang does not thus 
summarize the character of Prince Charles, the pic- 
ture given by that unworthy's own correspondence 
is not much more flattering, and removes most of the 
little idealistic romance that still lingered about the 
name. The author says, very fairly : " Our history 
is of next to no political value, but it revives as in 
a magic mirror certain scenes of actual human life. 
Now and again the mist breaks and real passionate 
faces are beheld in the clear-obscure. We mark 
Pickle furtively scribbling after midnight in French 
inns. We note Charles hiding in the alcove of a 
lady's chamber in a convent. The old histories 
emerge into light, like the writing in sympathetic 
ink on the secret despatches of King James." Young 
Glengarry would be a disgrace to a band of Jameses 
or Youngers ; and the chief pathos to the fortunes 
of the Stuart claimants is that honest loyal-hearted 
Scots should have spilled their good red blood for 
such selfish varlets. The book is provided with 
very thorough table of contents and index, with six 
fine portraits, and is luxurious typographically. 

The " Introduction to Geology " 
Geology and (Macmillan), by Professor William 

kindred subjects. ^ / ' ' . . 

B. Scott of Princeton University, 
illustrates an important change in the drift of geo- 
logical science, as to both investigation and instruc- 
tion, which has occurred within the last few years. 
Not long since, the bulk of a geological text-book 
was filled with palaeontology, the records of crea- 
tion and development entombed in the stratified 
rocks. Dynamical geology was treated as an ad- 
dendum, filled with speculations and probabilities. 
Its hypotheses were presented as guesses at truths 
rather than as theories substantially grounded upon 
physical and chemical verities. In Professor Scott's 
manual these conditions are reversed. He attacks 
at once the problems of the building of mountains, 
the carving of their uplifted masses by air and 
water, in streams, fluid and frozen, the covering of 
vast areas with alluvium, and the spreading of the 
debris of eroded continents over the wide floors of 
oceanic basins, afterward to be again lifted into the 
air and to be subjected to the renewed processes of 
physical change. And this field he treads not un- 
certainly, but with a confidence based upon a wealth 
of observation and deduction well sifted and sys- 
temised. After his earth has been fashioned, he 
proceeds to show how it has been filled with living 
things. His illustrations are numerous and perti- 
nent, but some have suffered in the printing, while 
that of Vesuvius, on page 55, has been reversed. 
As a text-book this work appears to be admirably 
adapted to the needs of the class-room. A fitting 
supplement to Professor Scott's " Introduction " ap-

Merrill of the United States National Museum. The 
study of geologic formations leads naturally to an 
investigation of the materials of the rocks, the phy- 
sical and chemical forces which unite them, and the 
methods of their disintegration and decomposition. 
Thus comes the evidence that within the rocks are 
stored essential elements of food, which, under the 
solvent action of air and moisture, become available 
for the nourishment of plants, which in turn support 
all animated life. For Nature's economy wins bread 
out of a stone. The work evidences the study of a 
wide range of authorities and great industry of pre- 
paration. Such of the illustrations as have been 
printed carefully upon separate pages are very effec- 
tive. Professor Israel C. Russell, of the University 
of Michigan, modestly offers as a " reading book 
for students of geography and geology " his well- 
written work upon " The Glaciers of North America " 
(Ginn). In past geologic ages the glacier has been 
an agent of tremendous power for carving and 
smoothing the rocky ribs of the earth, and for trans- 
porting and distributing the d&bris which itself has 
made. From most of the scenes of its continental ac- 
tivity it has retired, but it still lives in places of high 
latitude or altitude. On the lofty peaks distributed 
along the Pacific slope, from the heights above the 
Yosemite to the unconquered summits of Mount St. 
Elias, grim sentinels watching over Alaskan wastes, 
are many living glaciers of magnificent proportions, 
and, for glaciers, easily accessible. Every phase of gla- 
cial action is thus offered to the study of the American 
geologist on a scale surpassed, if at all, only in the 
fastnesses of the Himalayas or of the polar zones. 
Professor Russell presents a graphic account of 
these frozen rivers as observed by himself and de- 
scribed by others, with some very effective illustra- 
tions. He adds lucid explanations of the phenomena 
as interpreted by the most advanced hypotheses. 
His book is instructive and stimulating, and after 
reading it the student or the tourist who will not 
with his own eyes see the wonders of the Illecel- 
lewaet and the Muir Glaciers will be restrained by 
circumstances clearly beyond his control. 



The sonnets 
of muscular 
Christianity. 



The name of Edward Cracroft Le- 
froy will be remembered by some, 
perhaps, as the writer of a number 
of sonnets distinguished by their pure and classic 
thought, and by others for the somewhat singular 
position which he may claim in the development of 
English ideas in our own time. Two lines of thought, 
or, more exactly, two theories of life, are 
marked for us by the names of Charles Kingsley 
and Thomas Hughes on the one hand, and of Walter 
Pater and John Addington Symonds on the other. 
" Muscular Christianity " is the name by which we 
think of the first ; "^Esthetic Hedonism " is a nick- 
name which has been given the latter. Lefroy, a 
brilliant Oxford man and afterward a curate in sev- 
eral charges, was really trying to find a via media 
between the two. He would not himself have ac- 
knowledged that this was his effort. " Pater Pa- 



ganism and Symonds Sensuality " was, we believe, 
the term he found for the one tendency, while to 
the other he was openly and earnestly attached. Yet 
those who believe that paganism and sensuality are 
not a necessary development of what has been called 
"JEstheticism " will not be surprised that it should 
have been the appreciative essay of Symonds him- 
self that has given many their sole acquaintance 
with Lefroy. Now, however, Lefroy's sonnets and 
other poems have been republished (John Lane) in 
a volume prefaced by a short memoir by Wilfrid A. 
Gill, and followed by the essay by Symonds just 
mentioned. It is a book which many will wish to 
have, not merely, however, for an interest in the 
author's ideas. The sonnets are not precisely in the 
tone of our day, but they have a cool touch that is 
refreshing.

short sketches bearing the collective name of " My 
Village" (Scribner). The author, Mr. E. Boyd 
Smith, is an American artist, a native of Boston, 
who has for years plied his art in Paris during the 
winters, and in the summers found a congenial 
change in the small community inhabiting Valombre, 
a hamlet lying a few miles to the northward. He 
has dwelt among these simple villagers as one of 
them, entering into their life with friendly sympa- 
thy, and by such close contact gaining an intimate 
knowledge of their individual characteristics along 
with their general habits and customs. His sketches, 
apparently careless of a formal connection, succeed 
in presenting a continuous history of persons and 
families, and in exciting a greater interest than 
might be supposed from the quiet incidents which 
make up the narrative. But it is human nature 
which they depict, and its vicissitudes of joy and 
sorrow, trial and tragedy, are the same in every 
rank and condition, and move us inevitably with 
their heroism and pathos. The author's illustrations 
are full of spirit and suggestiveness, a bare un- 
studied outline sufficing, through the artist's skilful 
management, to set a vivid situation in detail before 
us. The monotint plates are the result of a singu- 
lar process, being drawn in a thin layer of moist 
black paint on a porcelain plate, and the impression 
taken off upon paper by pressure with the hand. It 
is a process requiring swift and dextrous execution.

ties, history, legends, manners, all in his peculiarly 
delicate, sensitive, finished style, and with that large 
appreciativeness and thoughtful urbanity which 
were so characteristic of the man. The second and 
slighter sketch is concerned with the town of Autun ; 
and while this is hardly as interesting as the first 
paper, it is yet very agreeable reading. For the 
visitor to Autun and its vicinity, this book will be 
indispensable ; and although it is one of Hamerton's 
less important works, it will serve to please and 
instruct cultivated readers everywhere. The volume 
is prefaced by a good portrait of the author. 

Away to the east of Reunion, in the 
Indian Ocean, lies the island of Lorn- 
bock, of which a full account is given 
by Captain Cool in " With the Dutch in the East " 
(Luzac & Co., London). Lombock is one of the 
Sunda Islands to the east of Java, is about the size 
of our Long Island, and has a population variously 
estimated at from 100,000 to 1,000,000 the latter 
figures evidently a gross inaccuracy. The volume 
is largely a compilation from Dutch sources, with 
some quotations from Wallace's " Malay Archi- 
pelago." The historical sketch of the island includes 
a full report of the recent operations of the Dutch 
army against the Balinese. Several chapters are 
also given to an account of the country and of its 
people, both the Balinese and the Sassaks. While 
the work contains some good material, it is not very 
skilfully put together, and the impression is further 
marred by the absurdly short paragraphs. The illus- 
trations are in the main well drawn and interesting, 
but the printing and binding of the book are hardly 
to be commended. 

Mr. Reginald B. Brett's " The Yoke 
* Empire " (Macmillan), outwardly 
a most attractive little volume, con- 
tains brief sketches of Victoria's Prime Ministers, 
including her " Permanent Minister " Prince Albert. 
The chapters, except the last two, are reprinted from 
the " Nineteenth Century " magazine. The author 
endeavors throughout, as he says, " to illustrate a 
single point the human relation between a Consti- 
tutional Sovereign and her Ministers." For the 
behoof of American readers, especially, the point 
seems well worth illustrating, and Mr. Brett does it 
in an interesting way. Much may be gathered from 
the book touching the personal weight and influence 
of Victoria as a political entity in national affairs ; 
and the characters of the several ministers are 
shrewdly and graphically outlined. The portraits 
are notably good. 

Miss Frances Macnab's work entitled 
"On Veldt and Farm" (Edward 
Arnold) is a handbook on the Cape 
country, and, being based on direct observation, 
appears to be trustworthy. As paying special atten- 
tion to farming interests, the volume will be useful 
to investors and emigrants. The sentiment of the 
book is distinctly anti-Boer, and some interesting 



descriptions of "the mediaeval existence of the 
Boers " are given. The account of a " trek " or 
cross-country ride with oxen and cart in Bechuana- 
land is quite graphic. The work may be recom- 
mended as a plain straightforward summary of the 
present state of affairs in Cape Colony and adjoin- 
ing territory. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. R. A. Streatfield's The Opera " (Lippincott) is 
an interestingly written history of the most popular 
form of musical art. Its aim is to sketch the develop- 
ment of the opera from its beginnings with Monteverde, 
Purcell, and Scarlatti down to its culmination in the 
gigantic work of Wagner. It provides the reader also 
with fairly full summaries of all the important works 
in the modern repertory. It is written in a pleasing, 
although not a brilliant, style, and its judgments are well 
and soberly expressed. We cannot always agree with 
them, but the divergence of our opinion concerns rather 
the nuance than the fundamental characterization. For 
example, " Tristan " is not the " Romeo and Juliet," but 
rather the " Antony and Cleopatra " of music. Mr. J. A. 
Fuller-Maitland provides the work with a well-consid- 
ered introduction. 

It is a lean year that does not bring at least one new 
edition of " The Compleat Angler," and Mr. John Lane 
has determined that 1897 shall not be such a year. It 
bids fair, rather, to be distinguished among Waltonians 
as the year of their favorite modern edition of the " An- 
gler," for it would be difficult to improve upon the good 
taste and the careful workmanship that have gone to the 
making of the edition that Mr. Lane has just published. 
It is in form a large and squarish octavo, sumptuously 
printed on choice paper, bound in buckram with a simple 
and appropriate cover-design, provided with a lengthy 
introduction by Mr. Richard Le Gallienne, and illustra- 
ted with great profusion by Mr. Edmund H. New. The 
illustrations are largely topographical, the drawings hav- 
ing in most cases been made on the spot, and the text 
followed is that of the fifth edition, which was the last 
to receive Walton's own supervision. 

For three years now, the quarterly parts of " Biblio-

that we note the receipt of the twelfth (and concluding) 
instalment of this superb periodical. Projected to con- 
tinue for three years only, the work has now run its 
course, and all who have been concerned in its produc- 
tion are to be warmly congratulated upon the result of 
their labors.. The eight hundred and fifty fortunate 
possessors of this noble work will find upon their shelves 
few tomes as stately, as beautiful, and as intrinsically 
valuable as the three volumes in which the twelve 
parts of " Bibliographica " are grouped for binding.

of the Biblia Pauperum," by Sir E. Maunde Thompson; 
" Late Jacobite Tracts," by Mr. Andrew Lang; "The 
Isham Books," by Mr. R. E. Graves; and "The Illus- 
trations in French Books of Hours, 1486-1500," by Mr. 
A. W. Pollard. Since " Bibliographica " was ushered 
into the world without a preface, the graceful valedic- 
tory " Epilogue " which closes this final number fitly 
brings the work as a whole to its close.

[May 16, 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Dr. George M. Harper has edited the " Pierre de 
Touehe " of Augier and Sandeau for the series of mod- 
ern language texts published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

An " Introductory Course in Differential Equations," 
by Dr. D. A. Murray, is published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. It is designed for " students in classical 
and engineering colleges." 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publishers of Professor 
A. E. Dolbear's "First Principles of Natural Philoso- 
phy," and of the more advanced " Experimental Phys- 
ics," by Mr. William A. Stone. 

Two new numbers in the " Half Moon " series of pa- 
pers on historic New York (Putnam) are " The Early 
History of Wall Street," by Mr. Oswald G. Villard, and 
" Governor's Island," by Mrs. Blanche Wilder Bellamy. 

We have received from Brentano's (Paris) a pamphlet 
containing Sir Edmund Monson's address on " Washing- 
ton and the Mother Country," given before the American 
University Dinner Club, of Paris, on February 22 of this 
year. 

Mr. Andrew Lang purposes replying to the Right 
Hon. F. Max Miiller's recent " Contributions to the Sci- 
ence of Mythology," in a volume which is to be called 
" Modern Mythology," and brought out by Messrs. 
Longmans. 

Two new volumes in Professor Knight's edition of 
Wordsworth, published by the Macmillan Co., give us 
a chronological arrangement of the " Prose Works," 
which have never before been brought together in so 
satisfactory an arrangement. 

Under the title " From a Cloud of Witnesses," Mr. 
David Wasgatt Clark has compiled an interesting col- 
lection of over three hundred tributes to the Bible, from 
the pens of the world's greatest thinkers. The volume 
is neatly printed in two colors, and is published by 
Messrs. Curts & Jennings. 

Dr. William A. Setchell's "Laboratory Practice for 
Beginners in Botany," published by the Macmillan Co., 
is an excellent book for those secondary schools in which 
the subject of botany is taken to mean something more 
than the study of a text and the identification of a few 
phaenogamous species of plants. 

We take pleasure in noting the completion, by the 
publication of a third volume upon " Light and Sound," 
of the admirable "Elements of Physics" (Macmillan), 
upon which Professors E. L. Nichols and W. S. Franklin 
have been for so long engaged. The " Theory of Physics " 
(Harper), by Dr. Joseph S. Ames, is another college 
text-book of the subject, this time in a single volume. 

Mr. George P. Humphrey of Rochester begins a series 
of " American Colonial Tracts " with the publication of 
"A Discourse Concerning the Design'd Establishment 
of a New Colony to the South of Carolina in the Most 
Delightful Country of the Universe." This tract, by 
Sir Robert Mountgomry, was printed in London, in the 
year 1717. These " tracts " are to appear monthly, and 
the subscription is three dollars a year. 

The death, at Kansas City, May 6, of James B. Run- 
nion, formerly of Chicago, closed the career of an esti- 
mable and well-known journalist, playwright, and man 
of letters. For the two decades following the war he 
bore an active and prominent part in the best literary 
and journalistic life of Chicago, a life of which the 
Chicago of to-day knows but little; and by the surviving 
members of that earlier circle he will be pleasantly 



and gratefully remembered. Mr. Runnion was born at 
Lafayette, Indiana, in 1842, came to Chicago in boy- 
hood, graduated from the old Chicago University, and 
after a few years of foreign travel entered the field of 
journalism, occupying positions as literary and dramatic 
critic, editorial writer, and managing editor, upon the 
"Times," the "Post," and the "Tribune"; while for 
the last ten years of his life he was one of the editors of 
the Kansas City " Star." Although thus busily engaged, 
he found time and inclination for much creditable work 
of a more distinctively literary kind. He wrote short 
stories and essays, which appeared in the " Lakeside," 
the "Atlantic," and other magazines; and in the first 
decade of THE DIAL he wrote for it many excellent 
reviews, chiefly of dramatic literature. He was a skilful 
and successful playwright, and was for many years 
employed by Mr. McVicker in translating and adapting 
pieces for his theatre. " Mignon," " Miss Manning," 
and " Hearts and Diamonds " are examples of Mr. Run- 
nion's original plays. His warm sympathy and delicate 
literary touch made him a superior translator, and he 
accomplished with signal success the difficult task of 
rendering into adequate English Lamartine's beautiful 
and poetic romance of " Graziella." His knowledge of 
the stage, and of its history and literature, was very 
great; and he enjoyed the personal friendship of Booth, 
Barrett, Jefferson, and other leading actors of his time.

In the three years since JOHN INGERFIELD, Mr. Jerome's last

movement. While his prevailing tone is gay, several of the tales have 
a strong emotional interest. 

IN PLAIN AIR. 

A New England Novel. By ELIZABETH LYMAN CABOT. 12mo, $1.25. 
As in Sudermann's MAG DA one of the main themes is the irrepres- 
sible conflict between a woman of the world and her narrow-minded 
neighbors, among whom she returns to live. But Mrs. Cabot's book is 
not tragic, but satirical and humorous.

THE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE 
AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 

By MOSES COIT TYLER, Professor of American History in 
Cornell University, and author of "A History of American 
Literature during the Colonial Time," etc. Two volumes, 
sold separately. 8vo, each, $3.00. 

Vol. I., 1763-1776. (Now Ready.) 
Vol.11., 1776-1783. (Beady Shortly.) 

" This work is the result of an altogether new and original treatment 
of the American Revolution. In the present work, for the first time, in 
a systematic and complete way, is set forth the inward history of our 
Revolution the history of its ideas, its spiritual moods, its passions, as 
these uttered themselves at the time in the writings of the two parties 
of Americans who either promoted or resisted that great movement." 

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE 
DURING THE COLONIAL TIME. 

By MOSES COIT TYLER, Professor of American History, Cor- 
nell University. New edition, revised. Two volumes, sold 
separately. 8vo, each, $2.50. 

Vol. I., 1607-1676. Vol. II., 1676-1765. 

" The work betrays acute philosophical insight, a rare power of his- 
torical research, and a cultivated literary habit, which was, perhaps, no 
less essential than the two former conditions to its successful accom- 
plishment." GEORGE RIPLBY, in The Tribune. 

CICERO AND HIS FRIENDS. 

A Study of Roman Society in the Time of Csesar. By GASTON 
BOISSIER, of the French Academy. Translated, with an 
Index and Table of Contents, by ADNAH DAVID JONES. 
12mo, $1.75. 

"M. Boissier's brilliant work is as excellent as it is a delightful 
introduction to the politics of the period in which Cicero and Caesar 
were, each in his own way, so great." London Saturday Review. 

RELIGION OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 

By ALFRED WIEDEMANN, Ph.D., Professor of Oriental Lan- 
guages in the University of Bonn, author of "The Ancient 
Egyptian Doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul," etc. 
With 73 illustrations from the monuments. Large 8vo, $3.75. 
Egypt stands preeminent among all the nations of antiquity as the 
land in which every civic and public interest was dominated by religion. 
The work is based throughout on original texts, of which the most sig- 
nificant passages are rendered as literally as possible in order that the 
reader may test the justice of the conclusions drawn from them. The 
author presents the principal deities, myths, religious ideas and doc- 
trines as they are to be found in the texts, dwelling more especially on 
such as have important bearings on the history of religion. 

ANCIENT IDEALS. 

A Study of Intellectual and Spiritual Growth from Early 
Times to the Establishment of Christianity. By HENRY 
OSBORN TAYLOR. Two volumes, 8vo, gilt tops, $5.00. 
"A book of exceptional value and interest . . . No more scholarly 
or useful book has appeared for some time." New York Herald. 

" The work is, on the whole, excellently done. The author has evi- 
dently read widely and dilligently on his subject ; he has made good use 
of the best authorities, and his own remarks and reflections are always 
judicious and to the point ; . . . the work is deserving of high praise, 
and will certainly engage the attention of all who are interested in study- 
ing the intellectual and moral progress of mankind." The Scotsman.

Jacobins. By JAMES EUGENE FARMER, M. A. 12mo, $1.25. 

"The master in history at St. Paul's School, Concord, N. H., has 

done a service to current literature by the publication of these careful 

essays upon two important epochs in French history. They have been 

written after thorough study, are scholarly productions, and worthy of 

permanent preservation." New York Observer. 

LAWNS AND GARDENS. 

How to Beautify the Home Lot, the Pleasure Ground, and 
Garden. By N. JoNSSON-RosE. With 172 plans and illus- 
trations by the author. Large 8vo, gilt top (in a box), $3.50.

12mo. 2 14 pages. Price, $1.25. 

"This is a compact volume of facts made up from notes 
by the author, who visited Nicaragua in 1895. . . . Those de- 
siring an intelligent knowledge of this question can scarcely 
find it more tersely and clearly discussed. That in the near 
future it will come prominently before the American people 
makes such a volume timely. Those who study its pages will 
have a clear view of the situation, both of its great cost and its 
great value to the commerce of the future." Chicago Inter 
Ocean. 

' ' However, the chief value of the book or these memoranda 
is not to be found in the political pages. The best parts are 
those dealing with the country and its population, with the 
appearance and features of Nicaraguan cities, with the route 
of the proposed canal and its probable cost, etc. As the canal 
is sure to be constructed, Americans will do well to inform 
themselves regarding the scope and nature of the enterprise 
and the conditions under which it will have to be pursued. 
There is no work extant which covers the same ground in the 
way adopted by Mr. Sheldon, and his book possesses distinct 
value on this account." Chicago Post (May 22, 1897).

By JAMES LANE ALLEN. Cloth, 12mo. Price, $1.50. 

The first edition is in the hands of the booksellers ; a second edition is now printing.

DANTE. 



Poet! who in thy vision journeyed through 
Hell's deep, and up the purifying hill, 
Through fires both temporal and eternal, till 

The rose of God's elect entranced thy view, 

To thee had life revealed as to but few 
Among the sons of men, what terrors fill 
The world's wild thicket, what the joyous thrill 

That knows alone the steadfast soul and true. 

This great New World lay far beyond thy ken 
When thou didst conquer life, and win release 

From all its heavy load ; yet now as then, 

And here as there, thy words may never cease 

To breathe into the inmost souls of men 

Thy strength, thy tenderness, thy perfect peace. 

W. M. P. 



DANTE IN AMERICA. 

Herr Scartazzini, the industrious German- 
Italian commentator upon Dante, has spoken 
of America as " the new Ravenna of the great 
poet." The comparison is a little forced, for 
the spiritual-abiding place of the deepest and 
tenderest of singers is now the whole civilized 
world, rather than any circumscribed area 
thereof, but our own country may at least claim 
a considerable share in his heritage, and no 
modern students have done him greater honor 
or paid him more true allegiance than our Long- 
fellow, Lowell, and Parsons, among the dead, 
and our Charles Eliot Norton, among the living. 
These names occur to everyone who gives a 
moment's thought to the history of Dante 
studies in America, but there are few who real- 
ize how many other nineteenth-century Amer- 
icans have from time to time paid the sincere 
tribute of their praise to the poet who, beyond 
any other that ever lived, binds with " hooks 
of steel" the souls of his followers to his own. 
We are more than ever before impressed with 
this fact after reading Mr. Theodore W. Koch's 
excellent study of " Dante in America," just 
published as the chief feature of the Fifteenth 
Annual Report of the Dante Society, and also 
issued by the author as an independent volume. 
The work is the outcome of a suggestion made 
by Professor Norton, who, as early as 1865, when 
the sixth centenary of Dante's birth was cele- 
brated, sent to the authorities at Florence a list 
of the important American contributions that 
had then been made to Dantesque literature. 

The first chapters of Mr. Koch's monograph 
are devoted to the work of the pioneers, among 
whom Lorenzo da Ponte, George Ticknor, and 
Richard Henry Wilde are the most noteworthy. 
The first of these three was a Venetian who, 
after a picturesquely varied career in several 
lands, came to America at the age of fifty-six. 
It is interesting to note that he was the libret- 
tist of Mozart's " Don Giovanni " and " Le 
Nozze di Figaro," and that when he began the 
book of the former opera, " he started by read- 
ing a few lines from Dante's * Inferno,' in order, 
as he says, to put himself into good tune." He 
lived in America about thirty years, and died 
in New York in 1838. His occupation in New 
York was that of a bookseller. He also taught

his native language, and was an unsalaried tutor 
at Columbia College for a term of years. There 
is evidence that he lectured and wrote a great 
deal upon the subject of Dante, and his contri- 
butions to the short-lived " New York Review 
and Athenaeum Magazine " constitute the first 
American textual criticism of " The Divine 
Comedy." Not very much is known of his life, 
and his closing years are wrapped in obscurity. 
In the pathetic preface of one of his later pub- 
lications, he says : " During twenty-eight years 
I have instructed in my language, which /, and 
no other, introduced into America, two thousand 
five hundred people, of whom two thousand four 
hundred and ninety-four have forgotten me." 

At the time when Da Ponte was engaged in 
awakening our interest in Dante, a scholar of 
American birth was at work at the same task. 
What we may call the Harvard tradition con- 
cerning Dante began with George Ticknor, who 
had learned in Germany to know the poet, and 
who, in 1831, was lecturing upon him three 
times a week at Harvard. Ticknor's second 
sojourn in Europe made him acquainted with 
" Philalethes," otherwise Prince John of Sax- 
ony, who was then at work upon his well-known 
translation, and a number of evenings were 
spent at the Prince's residence. The meetings 
of this " Accademia Dantesca " were devoted 
to discussion of the translation then in hand, 
Tieck being one of the participants. They were 
of much help to Ticknor, and the notes made 
by him at this time served as the basis of his 
subsequent class-room work at Cambridge. The 
historian Prescott was also interested in Dante 
at about this time, and a letter written to 
Ticknor, and dated 1824, is interesting as "one 
of the earliest American estimates of the great 
Florentine," as well as for the critical insight 
which it displays. Prescott was never a close 
student of Dante, but his reading went far 
enough to show him the many ways in which 
the second and third cantiche are superior to 
the first, which some later and closer students 
have failed to perceive. 

Richard Henry Wilde, of Georgia, an Irish- 
man by birth, but an American by adoption, is 
not very well known among Dante scholars for 
the reason that little of his work was ever pub- 
lished. He spent, however, several years in 
Italy, and devoted himself largely to the study 
of Italian poetry. His " Life and Times of 
Dante," which he left uncompleted, exists only 
in manuscript, and the last of the written sheets 
bears the date of 1842. During his stay in 
Florence, he made extensive original researches, 



and established several points that had escaped 
his predecessors. " I examined everything be- 
longing to my era in the archives, line by line," 
are the words in which he describes his Dantean 
labors. The fact of chief interest in this con- 
nection is that he was one of the three men to 
whom we owe the discovery of the Giotto por- 
trait in the Bargello. The credit for this dis- 
covery belongs to Wilde, Kirkup, and Bezzi. 
The search was set on foot by Wilde, and car- 
ried on with the aid of the Englishman and the 
Italian, the former of whom afterwards " took 
to himself credit for everything." Irving's 
account of the matter is perhaps as fair as any, 
giving Wilde his due, and closing as follows : 
"It is not easy to appreciate the delight of 
Mr. Wilde and his coadjutors at this triumphant 
result of their researches ; nor the sensation 
produced, not merely in Florence but through- 
out Italy, by this discovery of a veritable por- 
trait of Dante, in the prime of his days. It 
was some such sensation as would be produced 
in England by the sudden discovery of a per- 
fectly well-authenticated likeness of Shake- 
speare, with a difference in intensity propor- 
tioned to the superior sensitiveness of the 
Italians." Simms was another American writer 
who wrote appreciatively of Wilde's work for 
Dante, and it may be mentioned that Simms 
himself knew the poet and translated a fragment 
of the " Inferno " into English triple rhyme. 

Upon the Dantean labors of Longfellow, 
Lowell, Parsons, and Professor Norton it is 
hardly necessary to dilate, so familiar are they 
to our readers. Two of these men have given 
us complete translations of " The Divine Com- 
edy " the one in verse, the other in prose 
while a third has given us a verse translation 
of about two-thirds of the work. Professor 
Norton has given us, in addition, a translation 
of " The New Life." Lowell, who may not be 
reckoned among the translators, has enriched 
our literature with an essay on Dante which, in 
the words of a friend, " makes other writing 
about the poet and the poem seem ineffectual 
and superfluous." The sixth centenary of the 
poet's birth was signalized in America by Pro- 
fessor Norton's monograph " On the Original 
Portraits of Dante," and by the private issue of 
parts of the translations made by Longfellow 
and Parsons. Longfellow began to lecture 
upon Dante in 1836 at Harvard College, and 
continued this class-room work for some twenty 
years. His completed translation was published 
in 1867, with the notes and illustrations that 
have helped so many students during the past 



1897.J

thirty years, to say nothing of the six noble 
sonnets that are known to all lovers of poetry. 
As early as 1843, Parsons gave to the public 
ten cantos of his translation, and prefaced 
them by the memorable " Lines on a Bust of 
Dante." He worked upon his translation at 
intervals for nearly half a century more, but 
died with the second canticle unfinished, and 
the third hardly attempted. The class-room 
work at Harvard, begun by Ticknor and car- 
ried on for so many years by Longfellow, was 
continued with even more of inspirational effect 
by Lowell, and has of recent years been con- 
ducted by Professor Norton in a spirit worthy 
of the tradition handed down to him. The 
Dante Society, founded in 1881 by Professor 
Norton and others, has just issued its fifteenth 
annual report, and is said to be the oldest 
organization of its kind in existence. Finally, 
it must be added that the American student of 
Dante may now have access to collections of 
material that are hardly to be equalled in any 
other country. The Harvard collection has 
been enriched by accretions from many sources, 
while the generosity of Professor Willard 
Fiske has provided Cornell University with 
" what is in some respects the most remarkable 
Dante collection in the world." 

These are the facts of major importance con- 
cerning the history of Dante studies in Ameri- 
ca. For the minor facts, we must refer to Mr. 
Koch's admirable bibliography, which fills 
nearly seventy pages, and which includes not 
only editions and commentaries, but poems, 
magazine articles, and notes on the more im- 
portant critical reviews of the works mentioned. 
For a first attempt at a bibliography of this 
sort, the work has been done with unusual thor- 
oughness, and deserves high commendation. 
Year by year the entries increase in number, 
and testify to a rapidly growing interest in the 
subject. The catalogues of many of our leading 
universities now offer special courses in Dante, 
and the leaven of this study is at work in our 
national life. It is possibly true, as Mr. Koch 
says, that " there is no hope of Dante ever tak- 
ing the place of a popular author with us, of 
becoming one of our intimates," but it is also 
true that there are other ways than that of direct 
contact for the ideals of a great poet and thinker 
to influence the minds of the masses. A better 
acquaintance with Dante would undoubtedly 
" leave us a sense of the emptiness of much of 
that which we make our boast, and would teach 
us the instability of national position and the 
permanence of moral worth alone." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Apropos of the communications in THE DIAL called 
out by the important letter of Dr. E. E. Sparks in your 
issue for April 16, respecting the collection of materials 
for Western history, I desire to mention the work of the 
Historical Manuscripts Commission of the American 
Historical Association. This Commission was created 
in December, 1895, to perform functions similar to those 
of its English prototype, and the following circular has 
been issued and distributed by it to describe its plan 
and to interest individuals: 

DEAR SIB : Historical students, it is believed, will concur 
in the opinion that the general advancement of historical 
scholarship in America can in no way be better promoted than 
by the extensive publication of original materials hitherto 
imprinted. Of such papers a large number are in the posses- 
sion of the United States Government, and have been printed 
or will be printed by it ; others have been or will be similarly 
cared for by the governments of the Dominion of Canada and 
the individual States of the Union, or by local historical socie- 
ties which print extensive series. But much manuscript 
material of great importance to American history is not thus 
provided for, being in private hands or in the possession of 
institutions which do not print such papers. The interests of 
American historical scholarship have seemed to demand the 
creation of an agency, representing all sections of the country 
and affiliated to our largest historical organization, which shall 
systematically endeavor to bring these materials to the knowl- 
edge of students, and to print those which are of most import- 
ance. 

In this conviction, the American Historical Association, at 
its annual meeting in December, 1895, appointed the under- 
signed a Historical Manuscripts Commission, to deal in the 
manner above described with such manuscript materials as 
seemed to be of importance to American history. In this 
work, the members of the Commission hope to secure the 
cooperation of such private individuals and families as may 
possess or have knowledge of documents of historical import- 
ance. They feel sure that in all parts of the country there are 
collections of family correspondence which contain not only 
unpublished letters of our distinguished public men, but also 
many of a private character which would throw light upon 
our social and political history and might be published without 
breach of propriety. Private diaries also exist, and narratives 
of important movements and events by participants and eye- 
witnesses, as well as memoranda, account-books, and other 
instruments which would throw light on our economic history 
and especially upon those institutions and customs that have 
passed away forever. Should yon own or know of such his- 
torical materials and be interested in their exploitation, you 
are respectfully invited to aid the Commission in accordance 
with the following methods : 

1. By communicating to the Chairman, or such member of 
the Commission as yon may prefer, a list of documents in your 
possession, with brief notes as to their contents, state of pre- 
servation, and accessibility to students. 2. By stating whether 
you are willing to have your documents published should the 
Commission desire to print them, and, if so,|whether you 
could have them copied for the press. 3. By stating whether 
you would be willing, barring publication entire, to allow a 
list or calendar of your documents to be made and published, 
and under what conditions, in this contingency, the docu- 
ments would afterward be accessible to general and special 
students. 4. By informing the Commission of the existence 
of private collections of historical materials in other hands, 
and by using your influence to induce the holders to put them- 
selves in communication with the Commission or with some 
local historical society. 

The Commission promise that the matter printed by them 
shall be edited with care and accurately printed, and that 
whatever is chosen for publication shall be first submitted to 



328

the owner for his approval. They hope for your assistance in 
inaugurating a movement which they believe likely to prove of 
real and permanent utility to the cause of history in America. 
Your reply may be addressed to the Chairman, or to any of 
the Commission, at the addresses given below. 
Very respectfully yours,

The Commission has already placed the first volume 
of its Reports in the hands of the Secretary of the Amer- 
ican Historical Association, and the material is now in 
the process of advancement to the public printer's office. 
Among the documents contained in this report is a 
large mass of manuscripts illustrative of the efforts of 
the French minister, Genet, to secure the Province of 
Louisiana for France, with the aid of George Rogers 
Clark of Kentucky. These papers are chiefly from the 
Draper Collection of the State Historical Society of 
Wisconsin, including correspondence between Clark and 
the agents of Genet. The archives of the Spanish and 
the French governments have also contributed important 
material to explain the views of these courts upon the 
project, and the whole relation of France to the acqui- 
sition of Louisiana is placed in a new light. 

The Commission has also received, in response to its 
circulars, information of substantial attempts at the 
collection of manuscript materials in the West. It is to 
be regretted that these are largely devoted to material 
prior to this century. Many Western collectors have 
been more concerned to add to the material for Eastern 
history than to collect the documents needed to explain 
the development of their own region. The report of the 
Commission will include an index to such collections as 
were reported in time for its use. To stimulate and to 
make known Western collections is one of the things in 
which the Commission is most interested, and in which 
it earnestly desires assistance.

HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS IN THE MIDDLE 
WEST.- AN ILLUSTRATION FROM KANSAS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Although Mr. Hinton has already called the attention 
of your readers to the excellent work done by the Kansas 
State Historical Society, I question 'whether his note 
has given a realizing sense of the extent of that work or 
of the value of the collections. The builders of Kansas 
were conscious from the beginning that they were mak- 
ing history. In this respect probably no other com- 
munity offers a full parallel. The result is that the 
material collected to illustrate local history is greater 
in proportion to the age of the State and the importance 
of its fortunes than in any other State in the Union. At 
the beginning of this year, there were in the Society's 
rooms 12,188 bound volumes of Kansas newspapers, 
and 6,035 volumes of newspapers from outside the State. 
The Society has published five considerable volumes of 
reports, including the official documents and correspond- 
ence of all the territorial governors. 

But the most remarkable work in the line of histor- 



ical record for Kansas and I doubt whether it has a 
parallel in the West is Mr. D. W. Wilder's " Annals 
of Kansas," a volume of over a thousand pages, giving 
in strict chronological order the details of the life of 
the State as gathered from the compilation and con- 
sensus of this vast mass of newspaper files. Mr. Wilder 
was himself one of the earliest editors of the State, and 
was reputed to be one of the best informed and fairest. 
His " Annals " give the unadorned facts in the utmost 
possible condensation, made practicable by an extensive 
subject-index. 

In connection with the University of Kansas there is 
a quiet little body called the Memorabilia Club, which 
makes a business of collecting every sort of record of 
the institution and of those associated with it. 

Professor Sparks's note of Kansas- Nebraska material 
in the library at Keokuk (THE DIAL, April 16) tempts 
me to ask: Why should not a system of exchanges of 
original material be adopted ? For instance, this collec- 
tion at Keokuk seems to belong rather in the records of 
the Kansas Historical Society, while I am sure the 
Society has valuable material which it would be willing 



to trade for it.

THE ROMANTIC DRAMA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Frau Agnes Sorma, at the end of her recent engage- 
ment in New York, produced the latest play of Gerhardt 
Hauptmann, " Die versunhene Glocke." The play is a 
singular one and worth noting by those who watch with 
interest the contemporary drama. It is a fairy play 
(Mdrchen drama), and yet a play which deals seriously 
with serious ideas. " There is nothing for the stage in 
all this," remarks the New York " Evening Post," but 
notes, also, that the audience was intensely interested. 
The play has been in favor in Berlin since it was first 
produced last fall at the Schauspielhaus. 

The success on the stage of such a play is an indica- 
tion of one of the directions of the drama. Ibsen's 
" Brand " and " Peer Gynt " were dramatic poems, 
dramas to be read. Maeterlinck's romantic plays, let 
us say " The Seven Princesses," would hardly make an 
appeal to an audience. The same impulse is seen in 
Mr. Sharp's " Vistas," and in one or two of Mr. Fuller's 
" The Puppet Booth." None of these really attempt 
the stage. They are frankly meant as poetry and noth- 
ing more. But Hauptmann is a successful dramatist 
and he must put his ideas in form for public presenta- 
tion. Leaving the realistic topics which his vagrant 
modernity has recently handled, he puts serious thought 
in the romantic guise of a fairy tale. He would put 
allegory on the stage. 

This, I take it, is a Northern idea. The Northern 
nations love these obscure, mysterious forms, their 
imagination fluctuates and expands in these uncon- 
strained analogies, in these emotional infinitudes. It 
has its charm. " The light which breaks through the 
cloud," says Henry Bordeaux in "Ames Modernes," 
" increases its enchantment, and I would rather have 
these indefinite lines of mountain form which mingle 
confusedly in emotional magnificence than the uniform 
splendor of this serene and tranquil lake." In his last 
words he thinks of the Latin races, who still love the 
classic outline, at least at the theatre.

W&t 



SOCIAL, ENGLAND BEFORE WATERLOO.* 

The fifth volume of Mr. Traill's Social 
England " will perhaps prove the least satis- 
factory of the series.f This is due in no small 
measure to the character of the period covered, 
and to the increasing difficulty that has con- 
fronted the editor and his co-laborers as they 
advanced the story of England's progress into 
the field of recent history. Even the portions 
which Mr. Traill himself contributes to this 
volume on the subject of progress in litera- 
ture in the period from 1784 to 1815, are 
very far from being " a history of influences 
and tendencies " (p. 445), and have almost 
nothing to do with " the people." They have 
much more of literary criticism and of discus- 
sion of poetic theory than they have of public 
education and the literary habits and learning 
of the four or five millions of people that were 
added to England's population after the middle 
of the eighteenth century. Did these people 
read ? and if so, what did they read ? Were 
they educated ? and if so, by what means, in 
what schools, along what lines, and on what 
pedagogical principles? Such are some of the 
questions for which one seeks an answer in 
" A Record of the Progress of the People "; 
but one seeks them in vain in this volume. 

The volume opens with the age of Walpole 
and closes with the downfall of Napoleon. The 
period is one in which the history of England 
certainly cannot be summed up under any one 
descriptive formula. The political revolution 
of the preceding century was being completed 
and the way prepared for the industrial and 
material advance of the present century ; not 
only had the Augustan age of English litera- 
ture long since passed into history, but the wits 
of Queen Anne's time were dead or dying, and 
poetry was dominated by the classic but dead- 
ening methods of Pope. Neither of the four 
Georges could be called patrons of art or letters. 
But the eighteenth century has been made 
famous in art and literature as well as in poli- 
tics and industry. It is the century of Hogarth 
and of Boswell's Sam Johnson, of the school of

portraiture which was destined to the highest 
distinction in the persons of Reynolds, Gains- 
borough, and Romney, and which, indeed, 
" made the eighteenth century the golden age 
of English art " (p. 280). It is the century of 
Gray, Goldsmith, and Sheridan ; of Richardson, 
Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne ; of Hume, Gib- 
bon, Robertson, Bishop Butler, and Dugald 
Stewart. The social life of a nation is indeed 
complex which will produce such men as these, 
alongside of Marlborough, Wolfe, and Clive, 
Nelson and Wellington, the Earl of Chatham, 
Pitt, and Fox, together with the long list of 
discoverers and inventors who completely revo- 
lutionized English industry in the latter half of 
the century. Yet, in spite of these imposing 
figures in army and navy, in parliament and 
the civil administration, in church and state, in 
literature, art, politics, science, and theology, 
the age remains one of transition and prepara- 
tion rather than one of distinctive completeness. 
The work of the Revolution was in process of 
consolidation, but the work of reform which was 
attempted in vain in Walpole's time was begun 
again by the younger Pitt, only to be inter- 
rupted by " the panic engendered by the French 
earthquake," and was not completed until well 
into the present century. So, too, of the many 
social and economic movements begun in con- 
nection with the use of machinery and the 
establishment of the factory system. These were 
held in check not only by the peculiar inertia 
of English habits and institutions, but by the 
war and its burden of taxation, by the fear of 
a Napoleonic invasion, by the terror of French 
doctrines of democracy and republicanism. 
Fiscal reform, factory legislation, extension of 
the suffrage, Catholic emancipation, these 
and other steps in human progress were not 
made until after the close of the Napoleonic era. 
The two changes of greatest significance were 
in the development of cabinet government, and 
in the method of manufacture, particularly of 
textiles. George I. had practically no knowl- 
edge of the English Constitution, and he dis- 
played little disposition to acquire any. The 
chief direction of affairs therefore fell into the 
hands of his ministers. Moreover, he was a 
prudent man, and not inclined to try the experi- 
ment of a mixed ministry. The ascendency of 
the Whigs therefore continued without serious 
interruption until the reign of George III. 
That monarch prided himself on being an En- 
glishman, and determined to resume the power 
which his predecessors had abdicated to Wal- 
pole and his successors. But the victory of 



330 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Pitt in the election of 1784, which seemed at 
first sight to be the decisive event in the long 
struggle which the king had been carrying on 
against Parliament, was in fact a victory for the 
people. 

" The king undoubtedly regarded Pitt as the minister 
of his choice, and one who would carry out the royal 
views. But that statesman entirely appreciated the 
necessity of a close alliance between the king and the 
mass of his subjects, and by dint of consummate tact 
he obtained such an influence over George III. that the 
constitution was in no wise impaired by the apparent 
triumph of the royal power" (p. 366). 

Indeed, the essential features of cabinet gov- 
ernment were more strongly established during 
Pitt's ministry than ever before, in spite of the 
fact that what is known as liberal legislation 
was stopped and all schemes for reform sus- 
pended as soon as war was declared against the 
French, and although the reaction against a 
progressive policy continued until long after 
the defeat of Napoleon until 1822, and later. 
What George III. in vain attempted to estab- 
lish in England in the last century is practi- 
cally the system in vogue to-day in the United 
States, and is properly styled the " departmental 
system," in accordance with which each minis- 
ter is responsible for his own department and 
answerable to the president (or king) for his 
actions. The opposing (English) principle 
makes the cabinet consist of a body of states- 
men who are in thorough political agreement, 
and are jointly responsible for all the measures 
they propose, and practically responsible to 
Parliament. It is a principle which is not at 
all likely to be introduced into national politics 
in America, although we may find in it a solu- 
tion of some of the problems of city govern- 
ment ; but it became incorporated into the En- 
glish national policy during the last century, as 
the most important outcome of the Revolution 
of 1688. 

" It virtually deprived the sovereign of his right to 
reject bills which had passed both Houses. This right 
was indeed exercised several times by William [III.] 
with reference to measures of grave consequence, but it 
was only once exercised by Anne, and has never been 
exercised since her death. Since the Revolution, Par- 
liament has met every year, and has sat for a consider- 
able time. Ample opportunity has thus been afforded 
for all the legislation demanded by public opinion, and 
direct legislation has thus become the normal means of 
altering the law. Judicial decision continues, indeed, 
to be a potent agency of improvement, but it is used 
rather to define and apply principles already acknowl- 
edged than to introduce principles altogether novel" 
(p. 35). 

But this political development is in a sense 
superficial, resting on the deeper change in 



material condition and industrial progress of 
the people. The change in agricultural condi- 
tions and method is set forth with wonderful 
effect by Mr. Prothero, in his account of the 
aspect of the country in the middle of the last 
century, his explanation of the open-field sys- 
tem, and his picture of the rural life of the 
times. There are few things better calculated 
to give one a clear idea of how recent has been 
the real advance of the English nation. 

" Vast tracts of country, which are now cultivated, 
then lay waste and unenclosed. Cambridgeshire and 
Huntingdonshire were still undrained. Robin Hood 
would have found his forest of Sherwood still covering 
the greater part of Nottinghamshire. Derbyshire was 
a black region of ling, and from the northern point of 
the county to the extremity of Northumberland a 
distance of 150 miles the traveller would, like Jeanie 
Deans, encounter nothing but wastes. . . . Of the cul- 
tivated land of England, more than three-fifths was 
tilled on the open-field system in village farms which 
were practically isolated and self-supporting. The 
inhabitants had little need of communication with their 
immediate neighbors, still less with the outside world. 
. . . The average size of a single holding was eighteen 
acres of arable land, two acres of meadow, and common 
rights, over the common field and other commonable 
places, for forty sheep and as many cattle as the holder 
could fodder in the winter months. But each holding not 
only varied in size, but was cut up into minute, scattered, 
intermixed strips. One man might hold his portion of 
the soil as freehold, another as copyhold, another as 
leaseholder for life, another as a tenant for a certain 
length of time, from year to year, or at will. But what- 
ever the tenure by which the land was held, the whole 
was farmed in common upon a system which, originat- 
ing at a date before the Norman Conquest, in 1689, 
governed the tillage of at least three-fifths of the culti- 
vated soil of the country, and though it gradually dis- 
appeared in the last three decades of the eighteenth 
century and the first half of the present century, yet 
survived in 1879 " (pp. 100-102). 

It was not until near the end of the last cen- 
tury that the sudden devolopment of manufac- 
turing industries gave a wide market for agri- 
cultural produce, and the primitive self-sufficing 
farms were turned into manufactories of bread 

and beef. 

" Under the pressure of necessity, enclosures (both of 
uncultivated land and of open-field farms), reclamation 
of wastes, partition of commons, large farms, long 
leases, capitalist landlords and farmers, and scientific 
husbandry convulsed rural society, and absolutely revo- 
lutionized its general aspect. The extinction of the 
commoner, the small freeholder, the small farmer, and 
even the yeoman was the price which the nation paid 
for food for its manufacturing population" (p. 107). 

Toward the end of the century there came 
revolutions in manners and dress, and in pop- 
ular sentiment, as well as in agriculture, indus-

ments. The rise in the price of wheat from 
31s. the quarter to 116s., and the consequent 
scarcity of flour, necessitated some change oi 
diet ; while the added tax on powder (1795) 
actually caused a total change in the persona] 
appearance of both sexes, for men ceased to 
wear powdered wigs, and women had no more 
powdered " heads." Both sexes allowed the 
natural hair to grow. In July, 1795, the Privy 
Council implored all families to abjure pud- 
dings and pies, and declared their own inten- 
tion to have only fish, meat, vegetables, and 
household bread, made partly of rye, and 
the loaf should be put on the table for each to 
help himself, that none be wasted. An idea of 
the cost of living is given in the following list 
of prices : At a shop for ready-made clothes, a 
great-coat was 13s.; a waistcoat, 6s. 6d.; stout 
breeches, 3s. 9e?.; stockings, Is. 9c?.; dowlas 
shirt, 4s. 6d.; strong shoes, 7s.; a hat " to last 
three years," 2s. 6d. Linens and cambrics were 
still comparatively high in price. A woman's 
shift was 3s. 8^., when a stuff gown was only 
6s. Qd. A linsey-woolsel petticoat was 4s. 6c?.; 
pair of shoes, 3s. 9d; stays " to last six years," 
6s.; and " a hat of the cheaper sort," Is. Qd.

It was a serious, self-conscious time, a time when seri-

interesting than cards. Political excitement began to 
take the place of ' pleasure ' and ' diversion ' in the so- 
cial world. There were military, naval, parliamentary, 
financial, and literary careers to be made, and made 
quickly. It was a time to rouse ambition in young men, 
who now found themselves compelled to act, not to 
travel with a tutor, educating themselves to gain dis- 
tinction as professional idlers. It was a time of great 
inventions, a time when genius in whatever class it was

THE LIFE OF A GOOD PHYSICIAN.* 

Reviewers of books, we are told by Bacon, 
are brushers of noblemen's clothes. Perhaps 
no book ever made its reviewer more willing to 
acknowledge the aptness of this illustration than 
the work before us, which contains some posthu- 
mous autobiographical chapters from the life of 
a good physician, a noted reformer and philan- 
thropist, and an eminent scientist. They are 
written modestly and without the slightest pre- 
tention to literary style, but they make us agree 
with Emerson in his definition of autobiogra- 
phy "what a biography ought to be." 

Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, M.D., 
LL.D., F.R.S., was born in 1828 and died in 
1896. He was educated at the Anderson ian 
University, Glasgow, and at the University of 
Saint Andrews. He was a prolific writer on 
public health, alcoholism, poisons, education, 
and other topics, his best-known books being 
" Diseases of Modern Life," " Results of Re- 
searches on Alcohol," and " Temperance Les- 
son-Book." So much for a skeleton on which 
to hang a few comments and extracts. 

Consecrated at his mother's death- bed to the 
life of a healer of the sick, the youthful Rich- 
ardson never swerved from the course which lay 
before him. Every part of his education, even 
from the first, seemed to contribute to the one 
end in view. He says of his dame-school : 

" For my part, I was fortunately well-favored in re- 
gard to school-days. The practice of teaching boys to 
sew, not uncommon sixty years ago, and a part of my 
dame's plan of education, was a good practice, and to me 
proved uncommonly useful, rendering me, in the profes- 
sion of a doctor, more than usually quick, not merely in 
stitching up wounds, but in connecting bandages and 
making them fit with neatness of adaptation." 

From the account of his school days he passes 
to the description of his " entrance into physic." 
After coming near to yielding to a boyish freak 
to run away to sea, he followed the custom of 
would-be doctors of the early part of the cen- 
tury, and entered the office of Mr. Henry 
Hudson, a practitioner in Somerby, Leicester- 
shire, his own early home. Hudson was not 
only a good doctor, but he was also a general 
scholar, and humane and broad in his views. 
His influence on his young pupil may well have 
been important. The writer tells us how his 
master so hated the sight of the public stocks 
;hat he one night dug them up and cast them 
":nto the fish-pond. Regret is expressed that

the custom no longer obtains of binding boys 
for a number of years to practising physicians, 
as a necessary training for a medical career. 

" I have often said, and again say it, that this method 
of introduction to our profession, now practically aban- 
doned, was the best that could be, and ought to have 
remained untouched. It was a fruitful source of income 
to every respectable practitioner; it kept such practition- 
ers well up to the mark ; it made good openings for intro- 
ductions and practice; it was warmly appreciated by 
the public at large; it cultivated well a common field, 
and effected a sound and general good. The chief 
benefit was to the student himself, for he learned early 
in life all the practical branches he afterwards most 
needed; he soon acquired as 'the young doctor' the 
style and manners of the medical man; he learned the 
mode of entering the sick-room, and of conversing with 
the sick; he practised naturally the true etiquette of 
physic; he became a good rider on horseback, and a 
good df iver of gig or phaeton ; he was familiarized with 
the night-bell; he gained ripe experience as a dispenser 
of drugs, and knew by sight, touch, and odour every 
drug he was called upon to dispense." 

Truly a quaint and interesting picture of the 
doctor of the old school ! 

After leaving Dr. Hudson, Richardson en- 
tered the Andersonian University in Glasgow, 
and there and at Saint Andrews his medical 
education was completed. While he was in 
Glasgow the news of Dr. Morton's success in 
producing anaesthesia was brought to London 
and thence to Scotland, and caused the liveliest 
excitement in medical circles. Richardson and 
his class were waiting in the lecture-theatre 
when their lecturer, Dr. Moses Buchanan, en- 
tered, five minutes late, and announced that he 
could not address the class on that day, as he 
was on his way to the Royal Infirmary to take 
part in the first trial of the new discovery. 

" As a matter of course, this news created the utmost 
excitement. We trooped off to the Royal Infirmary as 
fast as our legs would carry us, and in due time were 
crowding into the operating-theatre. . . . The room 
formed a chapel on a Sunday, and in the rush for seats 
the best places were speedily secured. I and one or two 
other students got into the pulpit, which formed an 
excellent place for observation. . . . The patient was 
then sent for, and came in with quite a smiling face, 
delighted with the idea of being cut without pain, and 
rather proud, I fancy, at being the first man in Scotland 
selected to enjoy the honour as well as the pleasure. . . . 
Dr. Fleming, with the house-surgeon of the day for 
Buchanan's ward, commenced to administer the ether 
vapour from a sponge surrounded by a towel. In a 
short time the patient whose name, I think, was 
Macleod began to talk and sing in a loud voice in the 
style not uncommon to the second stage as we after- 
wards designated it of the ether narcotism, giving us 
a line or two at least from ' Bobby ' the poet Burns 
and communicating one or two secrets which he might 
just as well have kept to himself. He then lapsed into 
perfect quietude, and soon afterwards was allowed to 
wake up with the operation completed, without knowing 



that he had passed through anything more than a curi- 
ous dream, feeling, as he affirmed with a broad grin, 
just 'a wee bit fou,' and in no degree ashamed of his 
acquaintance with that condition." 

During his early practice much of it gra- 
tuitous, in a gypsy camp Dr. Richardson 
devoted considerable time to the study of pre- 
natal disease, and won the Fothergillian gold 
medal for an essay in this field. His abhorrence 
of animal suffering caused him to invent the 
lethal chamber for the painless destruction of 
dogs and other small animals. His active 
interest in public health led to his being chosen 
the first chairman of the Sanitary Institute. 
Annual sanitary congresses were held at dif- 
ferent towns in the kingdom, with exhibitions 
of sanitary appliances. A meeting at Leam- 
ington in 1877 was noteworthy. An exhibition 
was made of bicycles and the first tricycle ; they 
were shown as health-promoting devices, and 
Dr. Richardson rode one " in the presence of 
a large concourse of people." In a note, the 
writer describes the first or parent velocipede, 
made of wood, in the town of Leicester, in 1837 
or 1838. French claims to the credit of this 
invention are argued to be without foundation. 
It is interesting to note the contention of the 
writer that " by cycling, the sanitation of this 
country, to say nothing of other countries that 
have adopted it generally, has been advanced a 
hundred years." He further says : " All the 
world is for cycling now, as if a new pair of legs 
had been invented, and the advance in health 
and strength has been unparalleled." 

It were hopeless to attempt here any enu- 
meration of Richardson's reforms and discov- 
eries. For his researches in the effects of 
alcohol he perhaps deserves the most credit. 
At the cost of friends and practice, he stood for 
what seemed to him the right both on scientific 
and on moral grounds. So late as 1869 it was 
considered fanatical to object to a moderate 
indulgence in alcoholic drinks, while their use 
as medicines was universal. The chapter on 
" The Breath of Life " is full of suggestion, and 
shows the " scientific imagination " at its best ; 
while that on " Revolutions in Physic " gives 
a comprehensive survey of the vast strides made 
in medicine and surgery within the memory of 
men still living. Noteworthy is the author's 
attitude toward the modern germ-theory of 
disease, on which he acknowledges himself a 
skeptic.

ful life with feelings of gratitude that the life 
was so nobly lived and that a permanent record

INDIVIDUAL, ACQUIREMENT OR 
INHERITANCE ? * 

Of late years biological controversy has cen- 
tred about the contention of Weismann that 
modifications of structure or activity acquired 
during the lifetime of an organism are not 
transmitted by heredity to its descendants. 
The Neo-Darwinian school maintains that the 
effects of use and disuse, and the still more 
subtle influences of environment, do not pass 
from the body of the parent to the germ-cells 
or to the offspring developing therefrom. The 
whole burden of advance in the scale of life 
is thus thrown upon natural selection operat- 
ing upon congenital variations. The Neo- 
Larnarckians, on the contrary, insist that the 
modifications acquired after birth by the parent 
are in some way, as yet unexplained, handed on 
to descendants to be checked or accentuated, as 
may be, by natural selection. The inheritance 
of acquired modifications would thus become 
an important factor in the evolution of lower 
animals and of man himself. The final appeal 
must be made to the evidence of such inherit- 
ance displayed in the organic world ; and by this 
test the conflicting theories must stand or fall. 

Professor Morgan, in his work on "-Habit 
and Instinct," has transferred the discussion 
from the field of anatomical structure to the no 
less interesting and important realm of the 
mental activities of animals. Conciseness of 
definition and clearness of treatment make it a 
pleasure to follow the argument to its culmina- 
tion in the chapter on " Heredity in Man." The 
book is based on the author's minute and pains- 
taking studies of the habits and instincts of 
young birds, especially of those activities exhib- 
ited in the first few days of life when the distinc- 
tion between that which is congenital and that 
which is acquired stands out in sharpest relief. 

Instinctive activities are common to, and are 
similarly performed by, all like members of a 
more or less restricted group of animals. They 
are essentially lacking in individuality. The 
bear hibernates ; the swallow migrates ; the

chick pecks at small particles, not because of 
his individuality but because he is a representa- 
tive of his kind. It is difficult to draw the line 
between reflex and instinctive action ; Mr. 
Herbert Spencer has defined the latter as com- 
pound reflex action. A reflex act is a restricted, 
localized response to an external stimulus 
involving a particular organ or group of mus- 
cles. An instinctive act is a response of the 
organism as a whole, involving, it may be, 
many organs ; and the stimulus seems, in some 
instances at least, to be of internal origin, as in 
the case of the spinning of a cocoon by the silk- 
worm. The constancy of behavior in instinctive 
activities is not absolute, but, as in the case of 
structural characters, is probably subject to 
slight individual variations. These activities 
are usually performed under special circum- 
stances of supreme importance to the race, and 
are often of frequent occurrence. They may 
have a protective value, as in the coiling up of 
the hedgehog ; or they may be mimetic, as in 
the case of hunting spiders which rub their 
heads very much as do the flies which they 
stalk. Some instinctive acts are performed but 
once, and often in a serial order of remarkable 
complexity. This is well illustrated, as the 
late Dr. Riley has so admirably shown, in the 
instinctive acts of the Yucca moth, which, 
emerging while the Yucca is in bloom, collects 
the pollen from the anthers, kneads it into a 
pellet, and carries it to another flower. Here 
the moth first deposits her eggs in the ovary of 
the flower, and then rubs the mass of pollen 
upon the stigma. By this act the development 
of the ovules of the Yucca is insured, and at 
the same time the growing larvae of the moth 
are provided with food. The number of ovules 
is, however, in excess of their needs, and the 
surplus reaches maturity. This remarkable 
series of adaptive activities is performed but 
once in life, and unerringly. There is no pre- 
vious instruction, no opportunity to learn by 
imitation, no prevision of the outcome of the act. 
Instinctive acts are thus hereditary, and are per- 
formed with a definiteness which is congenital. 
Habit, on the other hand, implies individual 
acquisition, and is the result of repetition in 
individual experience. If, for example, nice 
and nasty caterpillars are placed before young 
chicks, both are at first seized upon with eager- 
ness. After a few trials, the chicks learn to 
distinguish, and the nasty caterpillars are re- 
jected. This definiteness of response is in every 
case a matter of individual acquisition, and is 
not ancestral ; it is acquired, and not congenital.

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



This formation of habits rests, however, upon 
an innate capacity for such habits, which may 
be likened to a legacy for general purposes, as 
need arises, while instincts are specific bequests. 
There are a large number of activities, the so- 
called instinct-habits, which in their perfection 
are of mixed origin ; as, for example, the flight 
of birds. The first performance is automatic, 
" involving the inherited coordination of motor 
activities due to outgoing nerve currents, and 
initiated by an external stimulus under organic 
conditions of internal origin." This instinctive 
activity furnishes data to consciousness, and a 
basis for modification and improvement in sub- 
sequent performance. The perfected flight of 
the adult bird is an instinct-habit, founded upon 
a congenital basis but modified by acquired 
experience. In this sharp limitation of the 
term " instinct," which from a biological point 
of view is most desirable, to those forms of 
activity of purely congenital origin, our author 
is at variance with Wundt, who includes the 
acquired elements with the congenital under the 
designation of instinct. 

As a result of the chick's first experience 
with the unpalatable larva, there is formed an 
association between the sight of the larva and 
its taste. Profiting by his past experience, the 
chick exercises thereafter an intelligent selec- 
tion in the choice of caterpillars for food. This 
selection rests upon the innate power of asso- 
ciation, and is developed under the quickening 
touch of individual experience. On this con- 
scious selection depends the development of 
those activities which are acquired i. e., habits 
as opposed to those which are congenital. 
This conscious selection by the individual of 
that which is desirable is the method of mental 
evolution, as contrasted with the elimination of 
the unfit by natural selection in organic evolu- 
tion. In the formation of habits, 

" The role of intelligence, therefore, is not to furnish 
a new activity which shall be adapted to what we, the 
onlookers, call the end in view, but to select from a 
number of relatively indeterminate activities that one 
which experience proves to be effectual. . . . Herein, 
then, lies the utility of the restlessness, the exuberant 
activity, the varied playfulness, the prying curiosity, the 
inquisitiveness, the meddlesome mischievousness, the 
vigorous and healthy experimentalist!! of the young. 
These afford the raw material upon which intelligence 
exercises its power of selection. Observers of human 
life have not -failed to contrast this useful expansiveness, 
ready to try all, dare all, and do all, with the narrower 
and more restricted, if more concentrated, efforts of 
those in whom the stern lessons of experience have 
checked so much that is picturesquely impossible. And 
this exuberant expansiveness of youth is a biological and 
psychological fact of profound significance." 



Are habits acquired by parents inherited by 
their offspring, or do they arise de novo in each 
generation, or are they handed on by imitation 
and tradition ? In his earlier work on "Animal 
Life and Intelligence," Professor Morgan held 
a view favoring somewhat the inheritance of 
individually acquired faculty. In the book 
before us he entirely abandons this position, 
owing, it seems, to a lack of decisive and abun- 
dant evidence in its favor. " There is," he says, 
" no conclusive evidence that the secondary 
automatism of habit is transferred by heredity 
so as to give rise to the primary automatism of 
instinct." Cases of instinctive behavior, such 
as " feigning wounded " by birds, which closely 
resemble intelligently acquired habits, are to 
be explained by natural selection acting upon 
congenital variations. This instinctive behavior 
is preceded by a habit an intelligently ac- 
quired modification to meet some new condition 
of environment. This habit, acquired by suc- 
cessive generations, is not, however, inherited 
as such ; but under its protection congenital 
variations in the direction of the modification 
in question are no longer suppressed by natural 
selection, and in time reach the full adaptive 
level of the original habit. The acquired mod- 
ification thus paves the way for the congenital 
variation, which culminates in instinct. 

Accepting Professor Morgan's limitations of 
the term " instinct," we find that man's con- 
genital endowment presents but a meagre array 
of activities. Sucking, grasping with the hand, 
creeping, walking, a tendency to use the right 
hand, the sexual instincts, the expression of the 
coarser emotions, and the utterance of articu- 
late syllables, well-nigh exhaust the list. The 
major part of his endowment consists of an 
innate capacity for acquisition and application, 
which enables him, under the guidance of par- 
ents and teachers, to cope with an environment 
of greatest complexity. Is this innate capacity 
increased from generation to generation by 
inheritance? Here again Professor Morgan 
turns to the evidence, and finds it quite inade- 
quate to sustain a belief in the transmission by 
heredity of individual acquisitions. Owing to 
man's intelligence, natural selection no longer 
plays an important part in his progress. The 
unfit are not eliminated, and in consequence 
there may even have been a diminution in, a 
lowering in the general level of, human faculty. 
The developmental process has been trans- 
ferred from man to his environment. The 
increment is to be found in history, in social 
institutions, in the products of art and of skill,

and in the record of noble lives ; these consti- 
tute the ever-progressing social environment in 
which each new generation finds its place and 
to which it makes its contribution. In this 
fact, rather than in the inheritance of acquired 
faculty, lies the explanation of man's achieve- 
ments in the past and the hope for race progress 
in the future. CHARLES A. KOFOID. 



MAX MULLER'S STUDIES IN MYTHOLOGY.* 



Many years ago, Mr. Max Miiller planned 
an exposition of the four sciences of Language, 
Mythology, Religion, and Thought. Three of 
these he has heretofore developed ; the fourth 
is considered in the volumes before us. That 
the work is important, need hardly be stated. 
Its standpoint will be well known by everyone 
who has followed the learned author's work in 
the past. That there is somewhat of a polem- 
ical spirit in the discussion, is to be expected. 
Some quotations will enable us to gain an idea 
of the author's position. 

"The really important outcome of Comparative My- 
thology, namely, the recognition (1) That the differ- 
ent branches of the Aryan family of speech possessed 
before their separation not only common words but also 
common myths ; (2) That what we call the gods of My- 
thology were chiefly the agents supposed to exist behind 
the great phenomena of nature; (3) That the names of 
some of these gods and heroes, common to some or to all 
the branches of the Aryan family of speech, and therefore 
much older than the Yedic or Homeric periods, constitute 
the most ancient and the most important material on 
which students of mythology have to work; and (4) That 
the best solution of the old riddles of Mythology are to 
be found in an etymological analysis of the names of 
gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines." 

There are three schools of Comparative 
Mythology the Etymological, the Analogical, 
the Ethno-psychical. The author, of course, 
belongs to the first, which he considers firmly 
founded ; he tolerates the second, as he con- 
siders polyonymy active, holding that one 
agent in nature may figure under many differ- 
ent descriptive names, which appear totally 
unconnected after their original transparency 
of meaning disappears ; for the third he has 
little use. He says : 

" While these two modes of treatment are guided by 
well-established principles, the Ethno - psychological 
method is still in its purely tentative stage, and depend- 
ant chiefly on taste and judgment." 

These quotations show the general plan and 
scope of these " Contributions." Mr. Miiller

demands profound linguistic knowledge as a 
prerequisite for profitable study of any given 
mythology. As profound linguistic knowledge 
can hardly be claimed for students outside of 
Aryan and Semitic languages, he would natur- 
ally see little value in present study of myth- 
ologies outside of the Aryan and Semitic. He 
devotes his own attention to the Vedic Myth- 
ology and the related mythologies of the old 
Greeks, Romans, and other ancient Aryan- 
speaking peoples. He presents a long and 
detailed study of the laws of phonetic variation 
now generally recognized ; he shows that these 
are not of invariable application, and that in 
proper names and the names of deities in par- 
ticular much latitude must be allowed. He 
then takes up, one after another, the god-names 
in the Aryan tongues, tracing the history of 
these names and referring them back to orig- 
inal nature manifestations. He still finds 
everywhere solar gods, dawn maidens, and the 
powers of the storm and cloud. Referring to 
the ridicule heaped upon him by critics in 
identifying the sun and the dawn so constantly, 
he throws the blame from his shoulders onto 
the ancients themselves. While the book is 
somewhat polemical, it is intended to be kindly 
and just, even to Mr. Herbert Spencer with 
his ghost theories, and to Mr. Andrew Lang. 
It is hard for an old man to be open to new 
views, but Mr. Miiller makes a mighty effort 
here to be judicial and candid. The work is 
most useful. There is value in Vedic Myth- 
ology and in the linguistic method, and these 
contributions are practically exhaustive in these 
directions. FREDERICK STARR. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Philip and Mr - David G - Hogarth's biograph- 

Aiexanderof ical essay on Philip of Macedon 
Macedon. (Scribners) gives a splendid example 

of what such writing should be. The essay gives 
both a clear view of the chief events in Philip's life, 
and an interesting analysis of the manner in which 
those events affected his character. After noting 
the period during which Philip, as a youthful hos- 
tage in Thebes, learned wisdom in government from 
his intercourse with Epaminondas, the author ex- 
pands upon the difficulty of governing the diverse 
peoples of Macedonia, a difficulty overcome by 
the fusing of distinct nationalities into a compact 
military force. Next, Philip is shown in the midst 
of his conquests, freeing the people of the conquered 
territory from their feudal burdens that they may 
welcome his government and resist the attempts at

reconquest by their feudal lords. The story is well 
and accurately told, but the chief merit of the essay 
lies in the picture given of Philip, shrewd in diplo- 
macy, bold and fearless in battle, rough and bois- 
terous in victory, yet always reverent of the culture 
of Athens, and always hoping that Athens may yet 
accept him as her champion. For although Philip, 
by creating the greatness of Macedonia, destroyed 
Athens' last hope of continued power, he never, not 
even after Chwronea, violated Attic territory. The 
accusation, usually made against him, of having 
checked the development of Athenian civilization, is 
refuted by the author, with the argument that the 
best elements of that civilization were already in 
process of decay, and that Macedonian supremacy 
gave a renewed vitality to Greek culture, by " forc- 
ing it out into the open sea," where by practical 
activity it influenced the whole eastern world. The 
essay upon Alexander is more difficult to follow, 
and less interesting as a study of character, the re- 
sult, apparently, of an attempt to treat at similar 
length two personages of very dissimilar historical 
importance. There are few original sources of 
knowledge concerning Philip, as compared with 
what is known of Alexander. The essay upon 
Alexander leaves the impression of too great con- 
densation, although at points, motives are treated at 
length and with an excellent analysis, as in the case 
of the founding of Alexandria. The book is excel- 
lently made in every way, yet should be criticised 
for its lack of maps with which to follow the text. 
There is a map of Alexander's eastern empire, but 
so much is put upon it that nothing can be found. 
It seems to us that historical works of whatever 
character, and particularly those intended for the 
general reader, should be provided with maps made 
to explain the text. To read the name of a place 
and not to know its geographical position, is of little 
value. The book is suited both to the general reader, 
and, from its wealth of references, to the student as 
well. Probably Mr. Hogarth's own knowledge, as 
an exploring scholar, of the geography of his sub- 
ject, made him overlook the possible ignorance of 
his readers.

excellent translation, by Elizabeth Gilbert Martin, 
of the initial volume of the new series, which is 
entitled " Louis Napoleon and Mademoiselle de 
Montijo" (Scribners), is now before us. With this 
volume M. de Saint- Amand begins what he proposes 
shall be an elaborate study of the history of France 
during the reign of Napoleon III. Beginning with 
an eloquently written general Introduction, the 
opening volume tells the remarkable story of Louis 
Napoleon's career from early childhood down to his 
marriage with Mademoiselle de Montijo. It thus 



embraces such striking episodes as his fiascos of 
Strasburg and Boulogne, his long imprisonment in 
and escape from the fortress of Ham, his election to 
the Chamber of Deputies, to the Presidency, the 
coup d'Stat) and the proclamation of the Empire. The 
picture M. Saint-Amand draws in his Introduction 
of the Empress Eugenie is most dramatic ; and it is 
strikingly at variance with certain recent portraits 
of that somewhat enigmatic woman, which we are 
inclined to believe have done her, to say the least, 
scant justice. The view Frenchmen not unnaturally 
take of their late Empress is tinged and warped by 
their resentment at what they believe to be her cul- 
pable share in the great national disaster of 1871. 
The sound of her name is coupled, like an echo, 
with that of Sedan. Had France conquered in that 
struggle, how widely different must have been the 
place in the national esteem of her who now a 
mater dolorosa, a fallen queen, widowed, exiled, 
and decried mourns over the ashes of extinguished 
splendor and vanished hopes. It may be that her 
prestige with posterity will, like Marie Antoinette's 
and Josephine's, be heightened by her fall, by her 
triple crown of sorrows worn with dignity. There 
is a characteristic touch of chivalrous sentiment in 
M. Saint- Amand's treatment of Eugenie. She is, 
he thinks, of all the women who have played a part 
in the second half of the nineteenth century, the 
one with whom posterity will be most occupied. 
M. Saint-Amand's peculiar merits have been so 
often pointed out by us that we need not further 
specify them now. The present volume exhibiting 
in a marked degree the qualities which serve to 
make its author one of the most attractive and stim- 
ulating historical writers of the day is by no means 
the least delightful he has given us. It is richly 
bound in crimson and gold, and contains portraits 
of Napoleon and Eugdnie in their younger days. 

" Diplomatic chess in the eighteenth 
**y - the Austrian game," would 
be a more expressive title for the 
two new numbers in the " Foreign Statesmen " series 
(Macmillan) on Maria Theresa and Joseph II. 
Two volumes to these two Austrian monarchs, and 
one each to Richelieu, Charlemagne, and Mirabeau, 
is a distribution which must rouse some wonder in 
those who regard the programme of the series. And 
it is an interesting phenomenon of distorted per- 
spective that the important though Machiavellian 
labors of Kaunitz must here hide behind the names 
of his royal masters, while it permits Richelieu and, 
in the parallel series " Twelve English Statesman," 
Pitt to eclipse the monarchs whom they served. 
As an account of the diplomatic movements of the 
Austrian court these volumes furnish at least a use- 
ful skeleton for the formal history of the time. One 
who should read them expecting to find a sympa- 
thetic account of Maria Theresa and her interesting 
son, or an adequate picture of their period in Aus- 
tria, would be disappointed. In a word, the two 
volumes should have been condensed into one and 



1897.]

entitled " Kaunitz." Then it could have been said 
of the work that the style is clear and the grasp of 
the complicated threads good. And yet it would be 
a very unrefreshing and little edifying historical 
font. The author, Rev. J. Franck Bright, is inclined 
to think it " not necessary to pass moral judgments 
upon the conduct of personages who fill the scene 
of history, and perhaps unusually superfluous in the 
present instance," yet he can scarcely suppress a 
feeling that the Austrian renunciation of the alliance 
with Great Britain was dishonorable. But the re- 
sponsibility for this must fall on Kaunitz, whose 
theory that " self-interest alone was the guiding 
principle in politics " the author seems to represent 
as exceptional. Could Mr. Bright find an instance 
in eighteenth-century diplomacy where the guiding 
principle on the part of Great Britain was not self- 
interest? The volumes are excellent typographi- 
cally. 

Somewhere between the collecting of 
stamps or of coins and the collecting 
of books or of engravings comes the 
collecting of book-plates. All collecting is in its 
nature inartistic : the collector invariably developes 
canons that have no relation to intrinsic value and 
are hence arbitrary or conventional. In some re- 
spects the collector of things delightful in them- 
selves is the worst kind of collector that there is, 
for in so far as he is a collector he cares not for the 
particular delightfulness of this or that. In the case 
of books and engravings, however, it must be con- 
fessed the collector often forgets his collecting and 
enjoys for its own sake one thing or other that he 
has collected. So he is often a very good fellow. 
It is the same, to a somewhat lesser degree, with 
the collectors of book-plates. The things they col- 
lect are often charming, and they often appreciate 
their charm, entirely aside from their value as " ex- 
amples." Hence we can read Mr. Charles Dexter 
Allen's " Ex Libris " (Lamson, Wolffe, & Co.) with 
a great deal of pleasure, for he has an appreciation 
of the artistic possibilities of the book-plate and, being 
rather the authority on the subject in this country, 
he has, of course, great knowledge of the development 
of its different styles and forms. His book is some- 
what " desultory and rambling," as he himself re- 
marks, but it presents in easily written essays a sketch 
of the history of the book-plate in different countries, 
and gives also in its illustrations a number of exam- 
ples of older as well as of more recent work. The 
book should serve to many as an introduction to a 
pleasant line of contemporary artistic activity. 



A handbook 
for the tludy 
of epics. 



Miss K. M. Rabb's book on Na- 
tional Epics " (McClurg) will prob- 
ably be most useful as a book of 
reference or instruction. In one volume the author 
has given some account of the great epics of India 
and Finland, of Old English and Old High German, 
of Old French literature and Old Spanish, of Homer 
and of Virgil, and of the great modern poets, Dante, 



Ariosto, Camoens, Tasso, and Milton. In each case 
a short account of the poem is given, an abstract of 
its action, a bibliography and some extracts from 
the translations. It will be obvious that such a 
book will have its value. Perhaps it would not have 
been impossible that it should also have been made 
interesting, like Leigh Hunt's " Stories from the 
Italian Poets " or Bulfinch's " Age of Fable." We 
suspect the exigencies of space are here important ; 
where one squeezes a thing into very small compass 
it is apt to get dry. Even as a book of reference or 
a text book it is not perfect. It is not quite up to 
date we should say, nor does it always take a good 
point of view. As to the first point, it will be noted 
that the publications of the last few years are some- 
times omitted. In the case of Milton, where recent 
work is of value, we have Cleveland's Concordance 
given in place of Bradshaw's, we have no mention 
of Verity's edition, with its important appendices 
and introductions, nor of Bridge's book on Prosody. 
These things (with the omission of Lowell's and 
Dowden's essays) show a lack of thorough informa- 
tion where one would have thought it could have 
been most easily obtained. Nor do we think that 
the author can fully appreciate the poetry of uncivil- 
ized peoples. Because the Finnish lays " are simply 
runes ' loosely stitched together,' [she] can regard 
them only with interest and curiosity, not with ad- 
miration." Of Beowulf she remarks that " the 
unknown writer . . . cannot be praised for his skill 
in composition ; the verse is rude, as was the lan- 
guage in which it was written." The book is not 
the best that could be imagined, but in spite of its 
drawbacks it will undoubtedly be useful to a large 
circle of readers. 

The eighteenth century, " an age 
Child study. touched with the spirit of hope," 

turned its attention to children and 
speculated with a sort of romantic glow as to how 
they could best be made good men. Hence Rous- 
seau and Pestalozzi and Froebel and Toepffer. The 
nineteenth century has regarded its children from 
different points of view : between Little Nell and 
Paul Dombey on the one hand, and the Psychology 
of the Child on the other, is a long swing of the 
pendulum, which is at each end, by the way, in the 
position of greatest instability. The child as a child 
is one thing, the child as an object of study is an- 
other. We have lately had in literature not a little 
concerning children. Nothing has yet reached the 
" Child's Garden of Verses " in presenting the child 
as a child. Mrs. Meynell in " The Children " (John 
Lane) rather avoids the comparison ; she considers 
the child as an object of study. A mother herself, 
and a woman of refined delicacy of perception, she 
cannot be without sympathy, yet she can rarely re- 
gard the child as other than a very interesting cir- 
cumstance. These essays have much the same charm 
of style as the rest of her work, but we do not feel 
warmed on reading them. Her children are pathetic 
little bundles of possibility moving about in worlds

portraits 
of himself. 



they cannot realize. Doubtless they have their own 
life, bat Mrs. Meynell gives no glimpse of it. Allur- 
ing, secretive, baffling, children are to her a constant 
source of interest. _ 

^ rather choice little book that should 
prove attractive to fanciers of the 
curious is "George Cruikshank's 
Portraits of Himself " (London : W. T. Spencer), by 
Mr. George Somes Layard. The book is a thin 
royal octavo of ninety odd pages, and the edition is 
limited to one thousand copies. It contains between 
thirty and forty plates after Cruikshank, in each 
one of which may be recognized, sometimes readily 
and sometimes after close inspection, the portrait of 
the artist himself. Several of the drawings have 
never before been published, and others are rare 
examples in the possession of a well-known collector. 
Mr. Layard's comments on the plates and on the 
artist are ingenious and sympathetic, and altogether 
the book will readily commend itself to Cruikshank 
collectors. There is also an Edition de luxe (limited 
to fifty numbered copies) of the work, on large 
hand-made paper, each copy of which will be accom- 
panied by a photogravure plate after Sir W. Box- 
all's hitherto unpublished portrait of the famous 
caricaturist. _ 

Mr. Ernst Grosse's "The Beginnings 
of Art " is perhaps the best so far in 
the " Anthropological Series " ( Ap- 
pleton). It is by a popular German teacher. Dr. 
Grosse begins by claiming that the true science of 
art has never been investigated. Having shown 
what needs to be done, he studies the rude begin- 
nings of art among the savage peoples of to-day. 
He refuses to look for beginnings except among 
true savages. Such populations are really very few. 
Those upon whom he draws for material for study 
are the Australians, Mincopies, Bushmen, Fuegians, 
Botocudo, and Eskimo. Art as applied to personal 
decoration is first studied ; then in succession, orna- 
mentation, representative art, the dance, poetry and 
music. Each is illustrated by examples drawn from 
the peoples mentioned. Not only is the early his- 
tory of each art traced but its social influence is 
carefully studied. Herein lies the chief value and 
originality of the work. 



The beginnings 
of art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In his " Outlines of Physics " (Macmillan), Professor 
Edward L. Nichols has prepared an elementary text- 
book to be offered as " a fair equivalent for the year of 
advanced mathematics now required for entrance to 
many colleges." Such an alternative as this in entrance 
requirements is, in our opinion, extremely desirable, and 
this text by Professor Nichols, both authoritative and 
up-to-date, is well fitted for its purpose. Experimental 
work occupies a large place, as it rightly should, in the 
work, and the laboratory equipment necessary for its 
use is not beyond the reach of any good secondary school. 

The enterprise which has led the American Book Co. 



to plan their series of " Stories of the States " is dis- 
tinctly commendable. Such books make admirable 
reading-matter for supplementary school use. Mr. John 
R. Musick's " Stories of Missouri " is the latest volume 
of this series, having been preceded by Mr. Stockton's 
" Stories of New Jersey." We note with satisfaction 
that forthcoming volumes are to give us " Stories of 
Georgia," by Mr. J. C. Harris; "Stories of Ohio," by 
Mr. W. D. Howells; and "Stories of Kentucky," by 
Mr. James Lane Allen. 

The latest additions to the series of " Longmans' En- 
glish Classics " are Cooper's " The Last of the Mohi- 
cans," edited by Dr. Charles F. Richardson, and Dry- 
den's " Palamon and Arcite," edited by Mr. William T. 
Brewster. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a pretty 
volume of " Lyrical and Dramatic Poems," by Robert 
Browning, selected and edited for school use by Mr. 
Edward T. Mason. Mr. A. J. George has edited Car- 
lyle's essay on Burns for Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
We may finally mention in this connection a treatise on 
" The Forms of Discourse " (Ginn), by Mr. W. B. 
Cairns, and " The English Language and its Grammar " 
(Silver, Burdett & Co.), by Miss Irene M. Mead.

school reading by Miss Ella Boyce Kirk, with an intro- 
duction by Dr. W. T. Harris, is published by Messrs.

a pretty new edition of " The Devotions of Bishop 
Andrewes," as " translated from the Greek and arranged 
anew by John Henry Newman." The Rev. Morgan Dix 
contributes an introduction. 

Publication of the English version of the Polychrome 
Bible, edited by Prof. Paul Haupt of Johns Hopkins 
University, which has been so long announced, is to be 
begun in October next. Messrs. Dodd, Mead, & Com- 
pany are to be the American publishers. 

A novel venture into the periodical field is " Birds," 
issued by the Nature-Study Publishing Co. of Chicago. 
The principal feature of this new monthly is a series of 
full-page bird portraits, made from stuffed specimens 
and reproduced in colors by a photographic process. 
These plates are of great beauty and value. 

The last bound volume of " The Century " magazine, 
ending with April, 1897, has for its most noteworthy 
features the beginnings of General Porter's " Campaign- 
ing with Grant " and of Dr. Mitchell's " Hugh Wynne."

ume in their " Book Lovers' Library " entitled " The 
Novels of Charles Dickens A Bibliography and 
Sketch," by Mr. F. G. Kitton, author of " Dickensiana," 
and " Charles Dickens by Pen and Pencil." The volume 
will contain a portrait never before published. 

The Macmillan Co. send us Balzac's " The Lily of the 
Valley," translated by Mr. James Waring; "Ezekiel,"

Professor C. H. Herford, and " Dr. Faustus," edited by 
Mr. Israel Gollancz, both in the " Temple Dramatists "; 
and " The Lyrical Poems of Robert Herrick," edited by 
Mr. Ernest Rhys for the series of " The Lyric Poets." 
Mr. Thomas B. Mosher has published a new edition 
of Mr. Charles Johnston's " From the Upanishads." 
This exquisite little book was obtained by Mr. Mosher 
a year ago as a " remainder " from the English pub- 
lisher, and was noticed by us in that form. The new 
edition is like the old, except for the addition of a " Fore- 
word " by the translator. It is now printed in the taste- 
ful style made so familiar to book-lovers by Mr. Mosher's 
other publications. 

The following lines were recently addressed by Prof- 
essor Skeat to Dr. Murray, upon learning that the latter 
had started on the letter H in the " New English Dict- 
ionary." 

" I 'm glad that you 've done so I hear you say 
With words that begin with D, 
And have left H. B. to be Glad and Gay 
With the Glory that waits on G ; 
And you laugh Ha ! Ha ! defying fate, 
As you tackle the terrible aspirate, 
The H that appals the Cockney crew, 
Lancashire, Essex, and Shropshire too. 
For they cannot abide the Hunter's Horn, 
And hold e'en Heavenly Hosts in scorn ; 
And I fear there are some that can scarcely say 
Why you did n't give Hat when you worked at A, 
Whose utterance leaves some doubt between 
The human Hair and an Air serene, 
The Harrow that creeps and the Arrow that flies, 
The Heels where chilblains are wont to rise 
And the nice fat Eels that are baked in pies ! 

We all rejoice on this New Year's Day 
To hear you are fairly upon your way 
To Honour and Happiness, Hope and Health 
I would you were nearer to Worldly Wealth."

A MANUAL FOR 

RULING ELDERS. 

Containing the Laws and Usages of the Pres- 
byterian Church in the U. S. A., in Relation 
to Ruling Elders and other Church Officers, 
Church Sessions, and Congregations, with 
Introductory Matter, Notes, and Sugges- 



tions. 



BY THE 



REV. WM. HENRY ROBERTS, D.D., LL.D. 

16mo, 459 pages. Price, $1.00 net, 
postage, 10 cents. 

[From the President of Princeton University.] 
" I have looked through Dr. Roberts' book, and 
am satisfied that he has rendered the Church a ser- 
vice in publishing it. It seems to me that nothing 
pertaining to the duties of the Ruling Elder has 
been omitted, and the whole subject has been dis- 
cussed with great clearness and comprehensiveness. 
FRANCIS L. PATTON." 



The scope of the " Manual " is very comprehen- 
sive. It is arranged in six main divisions, the first, 
Introductory, containing a brief statement respect- 
ing the history and principal doctrines of the West- 
minster Standards, and an exhibit of Presbyterian 
principles and Church government and of the his- 
tory of the Church. The following sections relate 
to the office of the Ruling Elder, the Church Ses- 
sion, the Church and Congregation (including pas- 
tors, deacons, and trustees), Rules for Judicatories 
and Forms for Sessions. 

The " Manual " is a reliable guide to ecclesias- 
tical law, and also a valuable aid on many points 
of Church usage. Quotations are freely given from 
the Constitution of the Church and from the deliv- 
erances of the Assembly. In addition, many topics 
of interest are dealt with in the way of suggestions 
and by historical notes. The book is very compre- 
hensive, but not diffuse. It touches upon every 
question that can be raised in reference to the du- 
ties of elders and sessions, and their relations with 
each other and with the congregation. 



THE WESTMINSTER ASSEMBLY: 
Its History and Standards. 

BY 

REV. ALEXANDER F. MITCHELL, D.D., LL.D., 

Professor of Ecclesiastical History, St. Mary's Col- 
lege, St. Andrews. Joint editor of " Minutes of 
the Westminster Assembly," " Minutes of the 
Commission of the General Assembly," etc. 
Second edition, with the Author's Revision. 

12mo. Price, $2.00. 

At the request of the Board of Publication, Dr. 
Mitchell has furnished a copy of his book, contain- 
ing his revisions and some important additions. Just 
at present there is a renewed interest in the work 
of the Assembly and our inheritance in its labors, 
which renders the reissue of this work especially 
appropriate. 

THE 

VALIDITY OF NON=PRELATICAL 
ORDINATION. 

CHURCH PAPERS. No. 1. 

BY THE 

REV. GEORGE PARK FISHER, D.D., LL.D. 

Octavo, 28 pages. Price, 10 cents net. 

The Presbyterian Church, being satisfied with her 
position as a true branch of the Church Catholic, 
having not only the Apostolic doctrine but the Apos- 
tolic ministry and polity, has perhaps been the less 
mindful to assert her claims. The time has, how- 
ever, come when such silence is capable of being 
misunderstood. The object of this series of " Church 
Papers " is to set forth and, where necessary, to de- 
fend that doctrine of the Church, the Ministry, and 
the Sacraments which is embodied in the historic 
Standards of the Presbyterian Church. 

This first number of the series defends the val- 
idity of Presbyterian ordination. The foremost 
American scholar in Church History submits to calm 
and impartial investigation the Anglican claims that 
diocesan bishops are a part of the Apostolic consti- 
tution of the Church, and that ordination at their 
hands is essential to a valid ministry. He shows 
the one claim to be without any historical founda- 
tion whatever, and the other to be a novelty even 
within the Church of England itself.

From the New York Tribune, May 16, 1897. 

"A TRIUMPH FOR 



THERE are two reasons why Mr. Davis should be congratulated upon his 'Soldiers of Fortune.' 
In the first place, he has given us in it the novel of life in a revolutionary South American 
State for which we have long been waiting, and, furthermore, he has made it a revelation of 
his finest gifts. His originality and skill in the construction of a brief story have long since been rec- 
ognized ; his animation and accuracy in descriptive narrative have won him a wide and a faithful 
public ; but he has done enough work of an unsatisfactory nature to give the reader pause when it has 
come to acknowledging in him a veritable master of the art of fiction. He is such a master in 'Sol- 
diers of Fortune.' His defects have disappeared. . . . What is presented between the covers of this 
delightful novel is the work of a mature romancer, writing out of a full mind and sure of his ground. 
From all points of view it is a good book. . . . We are made to participate in the events which have 
given a new power to the novelist's pen, and there is not a page in the book which fails of its effect. 
. . . The book is closed with a feeling of complete satisfaction."

The Macmillan Company's New Books. 



" The longest, strongest, and most beautiful of Mr. Allen's 
novels." CHICAGO TRIBUNE. 

The Choir Invisible. 

By JAMES LANE ALLEN, 

Author of " A Kentucky Cardinal," " Summer in Arcady," 
etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" There are two chief reasons why Mr. Allen seems to me one of the 
first of our novelists to-day. He is most exquisitely alive to the fine 
spirit of comedy. He has a prose style of wonderful beauty, conscien- 
tiousness, and simplicity. ... He has the inexorable conscience of the 
artist ; he always gives us his best ; and that best is a style of great 
purity and felicity and sweetness, a style without strain, and yet with 
an enviable aptness for the sudden inevitable word." BLISS CABMAN in 
The Evening Transcript, Boston. 

" ' The Choir Invisible ' is an epoch-marking book. It is a story to 
set up as a standard by which other novels shall be judged ; a rock in 
the desert of literature. Do not imagine that it is faultless or perfect in 
any way the rock in the desert has cracks in its side and blemishes, 
but these faults are so small, so insignificant, that it needs very little 
distance to utterly obliterate them, and then then you will realize 
that in writing ' The Choir Invisible ' Mr. Allen has made the most 
notable addition to the literature of the South that has been made for 
the last twenty years." The Commercial Tribune, Cincinnati.

Just Beady. 

A Rose of Yesterday. 

By P. MARION CRAWFORD, 

Author of " Taquisara," " Casa Braccio," etc. 

12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

The interest of the story centres around the question of 
divorce, and those who recall Mr. Crawford's allusions to the 
subject in more than one of his earlier novels will be prepared 
for his strong, but impartial, argument. 



By the Author o/" Bobbery Under Arms."

The Port of Missing Ships, 

And Other Stories of the Sea. 
By JOHN R. SPEARS. 

Cloth, 16mo, $1.25. 
" It seems to us that any collection of best 
short sea stories must contain John R. Spears's 
' The Port of Missing Ships,' for it is one of 
the sweetest and quaintest bits of fiction writ- 
ing that have appeared for many a day. Clark 
Russell never did anything so good. It must 
stand out as the best thing Mr. Spears has 
written to date." The Eagle, Brooklyn. 

On Many Seas. 

The Life and Exploits of a Yankee 

Sailor. 
By FREDERICK BENTON WILLIAMS. 

Edited by his Friend, WILLIAM STONE 

BOOTH. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" Every line of this hits the mark, and to 
anyone who knows the forecastle and its types 
the picture appeals with the urgency of old 
familiar things. All through his four hundred 
and more pages he is equally unaffected and 
forcible, equally picturesque. To go through 
one chapter is to pass with lively anticipation 
to the next. His book is destined to be re- 
membered." Ntw York Tribune, 



JUST BEADY. 
"Fresh and Suggestive." 

Genesis of the Social 
Conscience. 

The Establishment of Christianity in 
Europe in Relation to the 

Social Question. 
By HENRY S. NASH, 

Professor in the Episcopal Theological School, 

Cambridge. 

12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

From the New York Tribune. 

" Professor Hash's volume fulfils the prom- 
ise of its title. It does more, indeed, for the 
author is something more and better than a 
mere epitomizer of other men's thoughts. 
Not only is his treatment of the great thesis 
which he has undertaken to discuss fresh and 
suggestive, but he shows himself to be a clear 
and original thinker. . . . 

" In luminous and epigrammatic statement, 
in compactness of thought, and in a thorough 
mastery of the whole subject, he ranks among 
the best writers on Sociology who have ap- 
peared during the last twenty years, and we 
believe his book will come to be recognized as 
one of the most valuable and helpful treatises 
in the language." 



A New Novel by the Author of "On the

By FLORA ANNIE STEEL, 

Author of " On the Face of the Waters, ' ' 

"Red Rowans," etc. 

16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

'. . . Its charm pursues the reader along 
several lines. The central motive is original, 
and its development is even more unex- 
pected." The Tribune, New York.

attention irresistibly." New York Sun.

ling of heroic issues, stronger still in its calm 

veracity." New York Tribune. 
" Of quite extraordinary value and vitality."

Springfield Republican.

The Myths of Israel. 

The Ancient Book of Genesis, with Analysis and Explanation 

of its Composition. 
By AMOS K. F1SKE, 

Author of "The Jewish Scriptures," etc. 

12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The author resolves the Ancient Hebrew Book of Genesis into the 
myths and fragments of myths of which it is mainly composed, and ex- 
plains their significance and bearing in the literary and religious devel- 
opment of the Hebrew people. The book affords a striking example of 
the manner in which the ancient Jewish writings were produced, and 
of the results of modern critical research into their origin. 



A New Nature Story Book.

By MABEL OSQOOD WRIGHT, and Dr. ELLIOT COUES, 

... H j . i, Author of

American birds, illustrated by drawings from nature by Louis A. Fuertes. 

The Social Teachings of Jesus : 

An Essay in Christian Sociology. 
By Professor SHAILER MATTHEWS, Chicago University. 

12mo, cloth. In Press. 

It is based upon the belief that Jesus as a strong thinker must have 
had some central truth or conception, and that his teaching was there- 
fore not a mere collection of disconnected apothegms. Starting with 
this fundamental conception, the author endeavors to trace its applica- 
tion by Jesus himself to various aspects of social life, as society, 
economics, the family, the state, as well as to discover the forces and 
means upon which Jesus counted for the realization of his ideals.

CHA UCER. 

Thy words are like a sweet refreshing shower 
To one who travels on a dusty way: 
Thou breathest of the hawthorn boughs of May, 
And leadest one as to a pleasant bower 
Where, hidden in the tangled leaf and flower, 
Some little bird pours forth his roundelay; 
Then out again to meet the golden day 
In open meadows with their starry dower. 
Ah, Chaucer! thou art like a little child 
Who prattles all the day for very glee, 
And forces old and grave to be beguiled 
With woven tales and winsome imagery; 
Nor more than any child dost thou surmise 
How in simplicity thy heart is wise! 

EDITH C. BANFIELD. 



THE TRIUMPH OF THE MIDDLEMAN. 

The editor of " The Bookman " has recently 
made some remarks, as suggestive as they are 
true, about the way in which most men get their 
opinions at second or third hand. While the 
real scholars of the world are busily engaged in 
their single-hearted search after truth, there 
swarm about them the middlemen of thought. 
" Whatever stream of knowledge flows forth 
from the little sanctuary where the giants of 
learning smite the rocks of difficulty, these 
brilliant persons rapidly scoop it up into their 
own shallow vessels, and diluting it with the 
water of the first roadside puddle, run abroad 
throughout the world, selling the draught to any- 
one who may seek to buy. . . . Take almost 
any field of science, using that term in its 
broadest sense, and ask the average man to tell 
you the great contemporary names suggested 
by it, and he will always give you the names of 
middlemen, of men who sit in the outer gates 
of learning, and not within the penetralia." 
One does not have to look far for illustrations 
of this thesis. The late Professor Drummond 
was an excellent example. A mere dabbler 
in natural science, he was in all simplicity be- 
lieved to be one of its foremost exponents by 
the large audience that he attracted by the 
earnestness of his manner and the charm of 
his style. His lamented death evoked a chorus 
of eulogistic utterances, while the death, occur- 
ring at almost the same time, of Professor Syl- 
vester, who was one of the greatest creative 
intellects of the century, by way of ironic con- 
trast called forth only a meagre paragraph here 
and there. 

If we ask where the average intelligent 
reader, seeking to keep abreast of the swiftly- 
flowing stream of scientific progress, gets his 
knowledge of the problems that are being 
worked out from year to year, we shall find in 
almost every case that the middleman is his 
guide and prophet. Of this fact alone there 
could be no cause for complaint ; it is of the 
nature of things that " the stream of knowl- 
edge " should find its way to the public from 
" the little sanctuary " of its origin by devious 
channels and carefully-planned systems of irri- 
gation. Broadly considered, our entire educa- 
tional " plant " is nothing more than such a 



350 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



system of irrigation ; it muddies the waters and 
makes their flow sluggish, to be sure, but it 
does accomplish its purpose of bringing them 
to the places where they are needed. The just 
complaint is not, then, that the middleman ex- 
ists, but that in the performance of his useful 
function he looms so large in the view of those 
to whom he ministers. It is doubtless better 
than having no ideas at all upon such subjects 
to get our electricity from Mr. Edison, and our 
Buddhism from Sir Edwin Arnold, and our 
comparative philology from Professor Max 
Miiller. But it is unfortunate, at least, that, 
having got our ideas from these copious sources, 
we should be wholly unaware that such men as 
Clerk Maxwell and Professor Rhys-Davids and 
Professor Brugmann stand in the background. 
It seems, however, an almost unbroken law of 
human nature that the really great thinkers of 
the world do not come to their own as far as 
a reputation commensurate with their achieve- 
ments is concerned until it becomes possible 
to view them in the time-perspective of lapsed 
generations, and pronounce the definitive judg- 
ment upon their work. 

It may be urged that the wide diffusion of 
knowledge which we owe to the unprecedented 
activity of our latter-day press makes it impos- 
sible for the modern world to remain ignorant 
of its great men until long after they are dead. 
There is a measure of truth in this plea, and it 
is pleasant to contrast the fortunes of Darwin, 
for example, with those of Copernicus, the for- 
tunes of Schopenhauer with those of Spinoza, 
the fortunes of Wagner with those of Bach. 
But it must also be admitted that the popular 
press of to-day, with its unholy alertness for the 
new thing, does nearly as much to darken coun- 
sel as to illuminate it. When Job spoke of 
" words without knowledge," even his prophetic 
vision could hardly have foreseen such an illus- 
tration of the phrase as is offered by nineteenth- 
century journalism. Our popular periodicals, 
daily or monthly, do occasionally hear of the 
existence of some distinguished investigator, 
and help to make the public familiar with his 
work, but they are far more likely to exploit 
the sciolist and the charlatan, and every intel- 
lectual quackery that lifts its head requires only 
a little diplomacy to gain their encouragement. 
As for the middleman, his fortunes are built 
upon their ignorance, and their support so am- 
plifies his dimensions as to make him seem, to 
undiscerning eyes, a far more important figure 
than he really is. 

In all these reflections no word of reproach 



is intended for the popularizer who fulfils his 
proper function as an educator, and frankly 
stands as a medium for the propagation of sci- 
entific ways of thinking. Arrogating to himself 
no credit for the work of the original investi- 
gator, and freely admitting the secondary nature 
of his own work, he is one of the most important 
educational forces of the time, for he translates 
into a speech understanded of the people the 
technically-expressed conclusions of the men 
who are primarily responsible for the advance- 
ment of knowledge. This is a work of great 
usefulness, and our discussion would be de- 
prived of point were the work not so frequently 
made a means of self-advertisement or self- 
glorification, and were it performed only by 
men incapable of posing in false positions. But 
the allurements of vanity are not easily to be 
resisted, and the ease with which almost any 
acute mind of the secondary order may, by a 
certain glibness of speech and a certain affec- 
tation of omniscience, acquire a sort of popular 
fame, offer temptations that such minds find it 
difficult to resist, although they know in their 
hearts how cheap this fame must seem in the 
estimation of " them that know." It is the 
prevalence of this spirit, of this willingness of 
men to assume a virtue that they do not have, 
which calls for our protest, and which makes it 
desirable that we should learn to distinguish the 
middlemen of thought from the producers at 
first hand. 

If our debt be considerable to the popularizers 
who do their work with no thought of personal 
vanity, making it quite clear that they stand 
only as the interpreters of better men, our debt 
is still greater to the few who with their own 
hands bring down the result of their labors 
from the inaccessible heights where their work 
is done, and make it the possession of the mul- 
titude. The investigators who are their own 
middlemen, so to speak, are indeed benefactors 
of their fellows, but they are few in number, 
for the faculty of popular exposition and the

upon the men who do the pioneer work of knowl- 
edge. This happy conjunction of powers is 
found in but few men of any generation as it 
was found, for example, to a certain degree in 
Faraday, Huxley, and Tyndall, and preemi- 
nently in Helmholtz and Renan. But when 
such men appear, they are deserving of all 
honor, for they give dignity to the term " pop- 
ular science," which else would suffer under 
much reproach. It is theirs, on the one hand,

to purge the eyes of duller mortals as to impart 
a like clearness of vision. It is theirs, in a 
word, to seize upon new ideas and to give them 
dynamic effectiveness, not only to discover new 
regions of thought, but also to annex them to 
the world already known, and make all men 
free of access to their stores. 



THE METRE OF " IN MEMOEIAM." 

The editors of Tennyson's great poem, and the 
critics and commentators as well, seem to me to 
have laid too great stress on the novelty of the met- 
rical form that the poet has chosen to employ. I 
cannot for a moment believe that Mr. Jennings is 
right when he says (" Lord Tennyson," p. 125 ), 
" We have excellent authority for saying that, as 
far as Tennyson knew then, he thought he had 
invented the metre." The poet was surely too well 
versed in the lore of versification to consider him- 
self the inventor of so simple a metrical combina- 
tion as he makes use of in his immortal elegy. 

The metre is iambic tetrameter, each stanza con- 
sisting of four lines. The claim of originality is based 
on the rime-sequence (abba). This sequence, in four- 
lined stanzas, has, it is true, always been compara- 
tively rare in English verse, but less rare in German 
poetry and still less in that of France. Schipper 
(" Neuenglische Metrik," 311) thinks that its non- 
appearance in Middle English is merely accidental 
(zufallig) inasmuch as the alliterative sequence, 
a b b a, is common enough in Old English verse, and 
the rime-sequence itself not infrequent in the foreign 
Romance verse of the Middle English period. But 
is not Lydgate's "Roundel on the Coronation of 
Henry VI." a Middle English example? 

" Rejoice ye reames of England and of Fraunce ! 
A braunche that sprang oute of the flonre de lys, 
Blode of seint Edward and seint Lowys, 
God hath this day sent in governaunce. 

" God of nature hath yoven him suffisaunce 
Likly to atteyne to grete honure and pris. 

" O hevenly blossome, o budde of all plesaance, 
God grannt the grace for to ben als wise 
As was thi fader, by circumspect advise, 
Stable in vertue withoute variaunce." 

There were not many rime combinations unknown 
to the Elizabethans, and the sequence abb a forms 
no exception. Sir Philip Sidney interspersed eleven 
songs among his famous sonnet series known as 
"Astrophel and Stella." The " Second Song " (first 
stanza) runs as follows (see also his " Translation of 
Psalm XXXVIII.") : 

" Have I caught my heav'nly jewel, 
Teaching sleep most fair to be ? 
Now will I teach her that she 
When she wakes, is too, too cruel." 

Shakespeare himself tried his hand at this sequence 
in " The Phoenix and the Turtle." The best stanza 
is the seventh : 



"So they loved, as love in twain 
Had the essence but in one ; 
Two distincts, division none : 
Number there in love was slain." 

The stanzas cited are trochaic ; but Ben Jonson, in 
his "Elegy" ("Underwoods," XXXIX.), prefers 
the iambic foot, and thus employs the exact metre 
of " In Memo ri am ": 

" Though beauty be the mark of praise, 
And yours of whom I sing be such 
As not the world can praise too much, 
Yet 'tis your virtue now I raise." 

Thomas Carew (1598-1639), like Sidney and 
Shakespeare, prefers the trochaic movement. The 
third of his " Four Songs by way of Chorus to a 
Play " is entitled " Separation of Lovers." The 
first of its six stanzas is as follows : 

"Stop the chased boar, or play 
With the lion's paw, yet fear 
From the lover's side to tear 
The idol of his soul away." 

Edward Herbert (1581-1648), elder brother of 
the more famous George Herbert, used to be re- 
ferred to as Tennyson's only predecessor in the 
meter of " In Memoriam." Of his poetry, Mr. J. 
Churton Collins says (Ward's "English Poets," 
Vol. II., p. 188) : " It is uniformly musical, and his 
music is often at once delicate and subtle." But I 
have never been able to detect the music of these 
stanzas (cited by Mr. Collins) : 

" When with a love none can express 
That mutually happy pair, 
Melander and Celinda fair, 
The season with their loves did bless. 

" Long their fix'd eyes to Heaven bent 
Unchanged, they did never move ; 
As if so great and pure a love 
No glass but it could represent. 

" When with a sweet though troubled look 

She first brake silence, saying, ' Dear friend, 
O that our love might take no end, 
Or never had beginning took.' " 

Nor can I see anything but hopeless cacophony in 
this stanza from Herbert's lines " Upon Combing 
her Hair," lines which preserve, however, the same 
rime-sequence : 

" While gracious unto me, thon both dost sunder 
Those glories which, if they united were, 
Might have amazed sense, and shew'st each hair 
Which if alone had been too great a wonder." 

But it is at least an interesting coincidence that 

the name of Herbert's poem from which the three 

stanzas were cited a poem differing widely from 

" In Memoriam " in melody but not at all in formal 

me ter should embody precisely the problem that 

the great Laureate wrestled with two hundred years 

later. Herbert headed his stanzas " An Ode upon 

a Question Moved whether Love Should Continue 

for Ever"; and these three stanzas, barring a 

slightly archaic note in the form of expression, might 

almost pass for a selection from " In Memoriam ": 

" Not liere on earth then, nor above, 

One good affection can impair ; 

For where God doth admit the fair, 

Think you that He exclndeth Love ?

" These eyes again thine eyes shall see, 
These hands again thy hand enfold, 
And all chaste blessings can be told 
Shall with us everlasting be. 

" For if no nse of sense remain 

When bodies once this life forsake, 
Or they could no delight partake, 
Why should they ever rise again ? " 

Note especially the Tennysonian touch in the re- 
peated sounds of the first two lines in the second 
stanza ( " eyes " . . . " eyes," " hands "... 
"hand"). Tennyson makes frequent use of this 
device : 

" I cannot love thee as I ought, 

For love reflects the thing beloved ; 
My words are only words, and moved 
Upon the topmost froth of thought." 

William Somerville (1677-1742), in "The Oyster" 
(" Fable " viii.), has also left an exact metrical pro- 
totype of Tennyson's elegiac stanza, hut the mood 
is so different that the metrical similarity is hardly 
suggested to the reader : 

" Two comrades, as grave authors say, 
(But in what chapter, page, or line, 
Ye critics, if ye please, define) 
Had found an oyster in their way." 

And John Langhorne (1735-1779) repeats the 
same stanza in his " Ode to the Genius of West- 
moreland " (six stanzas) : 

" Hail, hidden power of these wild groves, 
These uncouth rocks, and mountains grey ! 
Where oft, as fades the closing day, 
The family of Fancy roves." 

In his lines " On Seeing a Wounded Hare Limp by 
Me," Burns adopts the metre exemplified in Her- 
bert's stanzas " Upon Combing her Hair," except 
that Burns's cleft rimes are masculine, not feminine : 
" Inhuman man ! curse on thy barb'rons art, 
And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye ; 
May never pity soothe thee with a sigh, 
Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart ! " 

Coleridge uses this metre (iambic pentameter) in 
his lines " To a Friend, in Answer to a Melancholy 
Letter," and mingles the same rime-sequence in 
many of the five-lined stanzas of "The Ancient 
Mariner ": 

" I closed my lids, and kept them close, 

And the balls like pulses beat ; 

For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky, 

Lay like a load on my weary eye, 

And the dead were at my feet." 

But the normal stanza of " The Ancient Mariner " 
has only four lines and these never employ the abba 
sequence. 

As soon as "In Memoriam" appeared (1850), 
Dante Gabriel Rossetti desired it to be known that 
he himself, in " My Sister's Sleep," had used the 
same stanza three years before (see Joseph Knight's 
" Life of Rossetti," p. 56) ; but neither Rossetti nor 
his biographer seemed aware of the fact that Ten- 
nyson had made use of this metre in " You ask me 
why " and " Love thou thy land," both written in 
1833, though not published until 1842. 

Schipper thinks it not improbable that the rime- 
sequence a b b a in English verse is due to the influ- 



ence of the Italian sonnet, introduced into England 
in the first half of the sixteenth century by Wyatt 
and Surrey. It will be remembered that each qua- 
train of the Italian sonnet does reproduce the rime- 
sequence abba, the metre being iambic pentameter. 
The infrequency of this sequence in English verse 
before the reign of Henry VIII. would seem to lend 
some show of probability to Schipper's conjecture ; 
but, after all, is it necessary to postulate borrowing 
or foreign influence of any sort for so simple a 
stanza? If an English poet has read and written 
hundreds of stanzas of the type abab and a abb, 
must he wait for the fine Italian hand to point out 
to him the possibility of a b b a ? 

Besides, if we must break a stanza to get at the 
origin of our rime-sequence (and the quatrain is 
but a fragment of the stanzaic unit embodied in the 
sonnet), why go to the sonnet at all? There are 
hundreds even of Middle English poems that illus- 
trate somewhere in the stanza (usually toward the 
close, rarely at the beginning) the abba series of 
rimes. These must at least have thoroughly accus- 
tomed the English ear to this sequence three cen- 
turies before the introduction of the Italian sonnet. 
Note the following stanza from " A Plea for Pity," 
written at least fifty years before the birth of 

Chaucer : __, . . 

With longyng y am lad, 

On molde y waxe mad, 

A maide marreth me ; 
Y grede, y grone, nnglad, 
For selden y am sad 

That semely forte se ; 

Lenedi, thou rewe me ! 
To routhe thou hauest me rad ; 
Be bote of that y bad, 

My lyf is long on the." 

In the rimes here employed (aabaabbaab), the 
rime-sequence of " In Memoriam " is twice im- 
bedded, just as it is in the Italian sonnet ; except 
that the Middle English poet ends his stanza with 
the rimes in question, whereas the Italian sonneteer 
and his imitators place the same rimes at the begin- 
ning ; but one position is not a whit more potent than 
the other in its influence upon succeeding poets. 

In other words, the stanza which Tennyson has 
now made familiar to all readers of poetry was 
once a part of a larger stanzaic unit : it was only a 
segment of a larger rime-circle. In the Eliza- 
bethan age, this stanzaic fragment became a stanzaic 
unit and assumed a stanzaic individuality of its own. 
The Italian sonnet may have had an accelerating 
influence in this development, but it by no means 
created the development. 

The stanza has always seemed to me preeminently 
elegiac ; and no American poet has shown so subtle 
an appreciation of its possibilities in this respect as 
has Whittier. The most exquisite passages of " Snow 
Bound " (which was published sixteen years after 
"In Memoriam") are the elegiac strains which, 
unlike the rest of the poem, are expressed in the 
rime-sequences of the great English elegy.

FILES OP CHICAGO DAILY PAPERS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the timely article of Professor Edwin E. Sparks, 
published in THE DIAL of April 16 last, on The Pres- 
ervation of Historical Material in the Middle West," 
I notice the statement " that to-day there is not open to 
the student in the city of Chicago a complete file of a 
Chicago daily paper back of the destructive year of 
1871." While this is, no doubt, true as to Chicago 
papers under their present names, it may be of interest 
to students of history to know that there is, in the 
library of the Chicago Historical Society, a file of the 
daily and weekly issues of the " Chicago Democratic 
Press," beginning with the date of its establishment 
in September, 1852, up to its consolidation with " The 
Tribune " in July, 1858. From the latter date the file 
is continuous for more than two years under the 
name of " The Press and Tribune," and afterward as 
" The Tribune " up to the present time. So that, 
regarding "The Democratic Press" and its imme- 
diate successor as the same paper, the file may be 
said to be complete and continuous for a period of 
nearly forty-five years. There are partial files of other 
Chicago papers as of the " Chicago Democrat," the 
" Chicago American " and its successors, " The Ex- 
press " and " Evening Journal," and other Chicago pub- 
lications of an earlier date in the Chicago Historical 
and Newberry Libraries, but nothing approaching com- 
pleteness to the extent furnished by the files of " The 
Democratic Press " and its successors, " The Press and 
Tribune " and The Tribune." p AUL SELBY.

DOCUMENTARY STUDY OP WESTERN HISTORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to add a word to what has already ap- 
peared in THE DIAL (April 16, May 1, and June 1) on 
the preservation of historical material in the West. 
Along with an appreciation of the real significance of 
the West in American History, there comes from stu- 
dents of history a demand for the better preservation 
of historical data relative to the growth of the Western 
States. But this material does not concern the historian 
alone. The West is a great laboratory for the observa- 
tion and study of social phenomena. Here students of 
Economics may witness economic phenomena presented 
on a scale which has but few if any parallels in history. 
In the course of a single generation a vast objective 
environment has been settled by individuals or groups 
of individuals; there has been a rapid growth in popu- 
lation by additions from without and from within; 
there has been an economic integration of agricultural 
and urban communities; industries have been located; 
transportation developed; great markets established. 

It is, however, to the study of American Government 
that the materials of Western history are, in my opin- 
ion, likely to make the most valuable contributions. Be- 
fore there can be developed a complete and satisfactory 
science of American Government more and better data 
must be brought together in the several States on terri- 
torial, commonwealth, and local government. None 
appreciates more fully the value of collecting and pre- 
serving the materials of Western history than students 
of American Government. 

But the materials of State history in the West should 
not only be collected and preserved: they should at the 



same time be made accessible to students generally. An 
effort should be made in every Western State to edit 
and publish all the important papers, documents, manu- 
scripts, etc., which contain historical material. Indeed, 
it seems to me that the publication of historical material 
is as essential as the initial step of collection. The 
publication of the documentary materials of State his- 
tory in the West would greatly facilitate the study of the 
West in American History. BENJ. F. SHAMBAXJGH.

HARPER'S DICTIONARY OP CLASSICAL 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

" Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and 
Antiquities" has been extensively reviewed, and the 
reviewers have generally agreed that the book is a val- 
uable one. Doubtless those who are using the dictionary 
will wish to correct in their copies such errors as the 
work contains. Those in the following list have not, I 
believe, been mentioned by any of the reviewers. 

Page 39, s. v. Afer, for Cnseus read Gnaeus. 

Page 608, s. v. Epigraphy, for Lebas read Le Bas. 

Page 725, s. v. Geographia, for Cosmus read Cosmas. 

Page 787, s. v. Hemsterhnys, for Raster read Kiister. 

Page 1198, s. v. Pentelicus, for PentelTcus read Pentelicus. 

Page 210, for BiturTges we should probably read Bituriges, 
and for DivitlScus (p. 529) Diviciacns. 

Page 1277, s. v. Plethrum, for "101 English feet" read 
" 97 feet 0.96 inches." The figures are given correctly in the 
Appendix (p. 1696). The same mistake is made, s. v. Sta- 
dium (p. 1488), where the old erroneous value of 606 feet 
9 inches should have given way to 582 feet 5.76 inches. On 
page 1032, s. v. Mensura, we miss some mention of the " Dorp- 
feld foot." 

Page 1578, s. v. Thule, for Pythius (bis) read Pytheas. 

Page 1620, s. v. Twelve Tables, for " Horatius and Valerius, 
the consuls of the year 499," read ''. . . of the year 449." 

Page 1218, s. v. Persius, the Conington-Nettleship edition of 
1874 should he replaced by the third edition, 1892. 

Page 1276, s. v. Plautus, Brix's fourth edition of the Tri- 
nummus appeared in 1888. 

Page 1564, s. v. Theocritus, the old etymology of the word 
Idyl is certainly open to doubt. The bibliography of this 
article should have mentioned the edition of Ahrens, and that 
of Fritzsche-Hiller. 

Pages 374, 923, 1177, 1371, the words Clytsemnestra, Larissa, 
Parnassus, Rhegium, had better have appeared as Clytemes- 
tra, Larisa, Parnasns, Regium. On page 1289, in the descrip- 
tion of the illustration, for Hexedra read Exedra. 

Page 165, s. v. Attins, vootum is an unfortunate choice of 
an instance of doubled vowels. Vootum is a Faliscan word ; 
no instance of a doubled o occurs in a Latin inscription. 

Page 513, s. v. Digamma, the editor says the word digamma 
" is not found earlier than the first century A. D., when it oc- 
curs in the grammarians." Yet Cicero uses it in his letter to 
Atticus, IX., 4, 4. 

Page 617, s. v. Equns Tuticus, " The term Tuticus is Oseaii, 
equivalent to the Latin magrnus." Tuticus is really the equiv- 
alent of the Latin publicus. 

Page 409, s. v. Corcyra, the statements about the earlier 
and the later form of the name do not agree with the facts as 
given by Meisterhans. 

Page 1122, why is the name of the town Odyssea differen- 
tiated in spelling from that of the poem, if the two names are 
alike in the Greek ? 

Pages 1016, 1177, the accentuation of the quotation from 
Matron is not correct. 

Page 1519, s. v. Tacitus, the editor speaks as if there were 
still some doubt as to the praenomen Publius. Publius is es- 
tablished by a Greek inscription found at Melassa.

LADY ISABEL BTJRTON.* 



Mr. Wilkins has justly styled his sympathetic 
and workmanlike Life of Lady Burton a " Ro- 
mance." Other than romantic the career of the 
wife of such a man as Richard Burton could 
scarcely have been, even had that wife been by 
nature a humdrum and compliant creature of 
the " Amelia Sedley " type which Lady 
Burton decidedly was not. Foibles enough and 
to spare have been justly or otherwise imputed 
to Lady Burton ; but no one, not even Miss 
Stisted, her ladyship's latest and harshest as- 
sailant, has ventured to call her commonplace. 
She was at least as uncommon, one might almost 
say as bizarre, a character as her learned, if 
somewhat erratic and intractable, husband ; and 
the pair were curiously alike even in their 
eccentricities. Their doings abroad, during 
Burton's several consulships, would alone make 
an amusing volume. With all his learning, 
the great Orientalist was of all Englishmen 
perhaps the one best fitted by nature to keep 
his official chiefs in Downing Street in perpet- 
ual hot water with any government he might be 
accredited to. He and his wife could generally 
be relied upon at any given crisis to do pre- 
cisely the unexpected and unaccountable thing. 
Socially, their career at Damascus, Santos, etc., 
may be described as a series of shocks (whole- 
some ones often) to the local sense of propriety. 
As a mild instance, it is related that when they 
arrived at Trieste, whither Burton was sent 
after his abrupt and to our thinking very proper 
recall from Damascus, the new consul startled 
the people of that town by ostentatiously march- 
ing coram populo down its high street to the 
consulate with a game-cock under his arm, 
while his wife followed him with a bull-dog 
under hers. This seems to have been their 
notion of suitable consular pomp. Or perhaps 
the animals were thus conspicuously borne in 
procession as emblems of the spirit of the com- 
ing consular regime. Lady Burton is delight- 
fully frank as to these little exhibitions of 
independence ; and she never fails to dilate 
complacently on their effect upon the natives. 
Of a like tenor with the Trieste exploit was one 
in Brazil. Says Lady Burton in a letter to a 
friend at home : 

* THE ROMANCE OF LADY ISABEL BURTON. The Story of 
her Life, told in part by Herself and in part by W. H. Wilkins. 
In two volumes, with portraits and illustrations. New York : 
Dodd, Mead & Co. 



". . . They have at last something to talk about now. 
I rode out about a league and a half, where I met four 
fine geese. I must tell you I have never seen a goose 
before ; they do not eat them here, but only use them as 
an ornamental bird. Well, Chico [her black boy] and 
I caught them, and slung one at each side of my saddle, 
and one at each side of his, and rode with them cackling 
and squawking through the town; and whenever I met 
any woman I thought would be ashamed of me, I stopped 
and was ever so civil to her. When I got up to our 
house, Richard, hearing the noise, ran out on the bal- 
cony; and seeing what was the matter, he laughed and 
shook his fist, and said, ' Oh, you delightful blackguard 
how like you! "' 

"Arcades ambo" the reader may naturally 
add. Lady Burton is by no means shy of a 
joke at her own expense. Commenting on the 
oddity of her own appearance, in foreign eyes 
at least, she goes on : 

" When I first came to Damascus, fond though I was 
of animals, I found that most of them shied at me. I 
do not think that they had been accustomed to an 
Englishwoman at close quarters. For instance, I went 
for a walk one day, and met a small boy leading a don- 
key laden with radishes, as high as a small tree. I 
suppose that I was strange-looking, for at the sight of 
me the donkey kicked up his heels and threw all the 
radishes about for a hundred yards around. The poor 
little boy set up a howl. I ran to help him, but the more 
I tried the more the donkey ran away, and at last I un- 
derstood by signs that the donkey was shying at me, so 
I threw the boy a coin and retreated, and sent another 
boy to help him. We called to an old man riding a 
shabby-looking horse, but the moment the horse saw me 
it did exactly the same thing, and nearly flung the old 
man off. My sides ached with laughing. Fancy being 
so queer that the animals take fright at one! " 

The following description of one of Lady Bur- 
ton's Damascus costumes (she was always mas- 
querading in one shape or another) may serve 
to explain the conduct of these animals : 

" My dress was very picturesque. It consisted of 
large yellow button boots and gaiters, an English riding- 
habit with the long ends of the skirt tucked in to look 
like their Eastern baggy trousers, an Eastern belt with 
revolver, dagger, and cartridges. My hair was all 
tucked up under the tarbash, and I wore one of the 
Bedowin veils to the waist, only showing a bit of face. 
The veil was of all colours, chiefly gold braid, bound 
by a chocolate and gold circlet near the forehead. 
Richard slung over my back and round my neck a 
whistle and compass, in case of my being lost." 

Mr. Wilkins's book is made up partly of an 
unfinished autobiography begun by Lady Bur- 
ton a few months before she died, and partly 
of extracts from a mass of letters, journals and 
so on bearing mainly on her travels and adven- 
tures. It has been his aim to let his heroine, 
wherever possible, tell the story of her life in 
her own words, and to keep his own narrative 
in the background. He has, in fine, endeav- 
ored to give a faithful portrait of Lady Burton 
as revealed by herself. The opening volume 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

deals with her ladyship's early life up to her 
marriage in 1861, with her Continental tours 
and trips to Madeira, Teneriffe, Portugal, etc., 
and with the period of her residence with Bur- 
ton in Brazil. Volume II. comprises the Da- 
mascus period, the journeys to Palmyra, the 
Holy Land, and India, the Trieste period, and 
the closing years of Lady Burton's life spent 
mainly in industrious retirement in England. 
Notably interesting are the chapters on Damas- 
cus. The following account of the Hammam 
(Turkish Bath) at that place may serve as a 
fair sample of Lady Burton's descriptive style. 

" I first went to the Hammam out of curiosity, and 
was warmly welcomed by the native women; but I was 
rather shocked. They squat naked on the floor, and, 
despoiled of their dress and hair and make-up, are, 
most of them, truly hideous. Their skins are like 
parchment, and baggy; their heads as bald as billiard- 
balls. What little hair they have is dyed an orange-red 
with henna. They look like the witches in Macbeth, or 
at least as if they had been called up from out of the 
lower regions. They sit chatting with little bundles of 
sweets and narghflehs before them. An average En- 
glishwoman would look like an Iwuri amongst them; 
and their customs were beastly, to use the mildest 
term. The Hammdm was entered by a large hall, lit 
by a skylight, with a huge marble tank in the centre 
and four little fountains, and all around raised divans 
covered with cushions. Here one wraps oneself in silk 
and woolen sheets, and after that proceeds to pass 
through the six marble rooms. The first is the cold 
room, the next warmer, the third warmer still, until you 
come to the sudarium, the hottest room of all. First 
they lather you, then they wash you with a lif and soap, 
then they douche you with tubs of hot water, then they 
shampoo you with fresh layers of soap, and then douche 
again. They give you iced sherbet, and tie towels 
dipped in cold water round your head, which prevent 
you fainting and make you perspire. They scrub your 
feet with pumice-stone, and move you back through all 
the rooms gradually, douche you with water, and sham- 
poo you with towels. You now return to the large hall 
where you first undressed, wrap in woolen shawls, and 
recline on a divan. The place is all strewn with flow- 
ers, incense is burned around, and a cup of hot coffee 
is handed and a narghfleh placed in your mouth. A 
woman advances and kneads you as though you were 
bread, until you fall asleep under the process, as though 
mesmerized. When you wake up, you find music and 
dancing, the girls chasing one another, eating sweet- 
meats, and enjoying all sorts of fun. Moslem women 
go through a good deal more of the performance than 
I have described. For instance, they have their hair 
hennaed and their eyebrows plucked. You can also 
have your hands and feet hennaed, and, if you like it, 
be tatooed. The whole operation takes about four 
hours. It is often said by the ignorant that people can 
get as good a Hammam in London or Paris as in the 
East. I have tried all, and they bear about as much 
relation to one another as a puddle of dirty water does 
to a pellucid lake. And the pellucid lake is in the East." 

Mr. Wilkins successfully defends Lady Bur- 
ton from the charge that her passion for prose- 



lytizing was the true cause of her husband's re- 
call from Damascus. His review of the case, 
based on the records of an official Blue Book, 
show plainly enough that Burton was recalled 
simply because his conduct at Damascus 
stamped him as an unsafe man for a post 
where tact was the main requirement. His 
squabbles with the Jews, with the English 
missionaries, with the Turkish Wali, with the 
Druzes, and with the Greek Bishop of Naz- 
areth, wore out the forbearance of his official 
chiefs who, so far as we can 'see, were patient 
and long-suffering. Lady Burton's reputation 
for eccentric and high- handed conduct cer- 
tainly did not help matters. The Greek report 
of the doings of the Burtons prior to the tre- 
mendous row at Nazareth, however exagger- 
ated, indicates pretty plainly that her ladyship's 
behavior was not exactly in keeping with the 
precepts of the gentle Nazarene. Of this re- 
port she says : 

" The Greeks said, in their report, that we began the 
quarrel, and many other things absolutely false. For 
instance, they stated that Richard fired upon them 
several times when they were playing at games ; that he 
entered the church armed to profane it, tore down the 
pictures, broke the lamps, and shot a priest ; and that I 
also went forth in my nightgown, and, sword in hand, 
tore everything down, and jumped and shrieked upon 
the debris, and did many other unwomanly things. This 
report was actually signed and sealed by the Bishop and 
by the Wali, and forwarded, unknown to us, to Constan- 
tinople and London. Naturally Richard's few enemies 
at home tried to make capital out of the incident." 

As to Lady Burton's course in burning (at a 
great pecuniary sacrifice to herself) her hus- 
band's translation of the notorious " Scented 
Garden," Mr. Wilkins says, in our opinion, all 
that needs be said. The book was anything 
but mrginibus puerisque. Burton himself had 
said of it : "I am afraid it will make a great 
row in England, because the ' Arabian Nights ' 
is a baby tale in comparison " with it. Lady 
Burton reflected, " Out of fifteen hundred men, 
fifteen will probably read it in the spirit of 
science in which it was written ; the other four- 
teen hundred and eighty-five will read it for 
filth's sake, and pass it to their friends, and the 
harm done may be incalculable." To the stock 
plea, " Puris omnia pura" she might have 
replied, " But purity of that degree is rare 
indeed." A consideration which perhaps out- 
weighed all others with her was that the book 
was of a character to revive and strengthen cer- 
tain ugly rumors touching her husband's early 
life which she had long combated. Whether or 
no Lady Burton was, all in all, justified in 
burning the " Scented Garden " is at least an

open question ; but the charge that in so doing 
she showed " the bigotry of a Torquemada and 
the vandalism of a John Knox " is overstrained. 
Miss Stisted's characterization of the act as 
" theatrical " is unfair. Mr. Wilkins goes into 
the question of Burton's ultimate religious opin- 
ions, and of the sincerity of his alleged final 
conversion to Romanism, at some length a 
rather barren field of inquiry into which we 
shall not follow him. We may say, however, 
that he shows Miss Stisted's sensational account 
of Lady Burton's conduct at her husband's 
death-bed to be as exaggerated in fact as it is 
illiberal in tone. As a zealous Catholic and a 
devoted wife, Lady Burton could not well have 
acted otherwise than she did. 

Mr. Wilkins's book is extremely entertain- 
ing a piquant compound of travels, adven- 
ture, and biography ; and the publishers have 
issued it in handsome shape. The illustrations 
comprise some interesting portraits of the Bur- 
tons, photographic views, and so on.

A PHILOSOPHER DECADENT.* 

No country in the world, not even America, 
is more sensitive to new ideas than modern 
Germany. The critical sense and a sort of 
divine discontent are so universal here that 
every innovator who speaks loud enough to 
make himself heard is sure of an audience. The 
fervor and intensity characteristic of this nation 
enable him immediately to gather about him a 
group of admiring disciples. At the same time, 
strong antagonists, so necessary for a man's 
fame, powerfully lift up their voices ; and soon 
the new prophet, deservedly or undeservedly, 
becomes an object of intense discussion. Such 
was the case with Richard Wagner, and such 
is the case now with that strangest of contem- 
poraneous individualities, bold and perplexing, 
the will-of-the-wisp of modern philosophers, 
Friedrich Nietzsche. 

The most salient feature in Nietzsche's sys- 
tem, if indeed he may be said to have a system, 
is admiration for power. All through his works 
runs the profound conviction that every form 
of salvation and happiness can come only from 
healthy, powerful, and untamed individualities ;

that the tamed, the " domestic animals," the 
diseased, who people our modern cities, are 
very largely due to a weakening code of morals, 
and that a complete " transvaluation of all val- 
ues " should be aimed at. In order better to un- 
derstand this remarkable man, we must cast a 
glance at his intellectual evolution as mirrored 
in his important works. 

In his early writings Nietzsche betrayed a 
rare mixture of artistic and scientific instincts. 
His treatise on " The Birth of Tragedy from 
the Spirit of Music," written under the influ- 
ence of Schopenhauer and Wagner, shows how 
highly the artist was developed in him. This 
pamphlet he afterward rejected, though it con- 
tained much that is suggestive, and we find that 
in the works following upon the composition of 
this essay he begins to express new, and in some 
respects original, views. He abandons Schopen- 
hauer and Wagner, and aims at what seems to 
him a correct definition of our moral code and 
at the establishment of new ideals which shall 
be " beyond good and evil." He tries to grow 
from an artistic into a scientific frame of mind. 
Human, All-too-Human" (1878,1879), "The 
Wanderer and his Shadow " (1880), " Dawn " 
(1881), "Joyful Science " (1882), record his 
new convictions. Then in 1883 and 1884 ap- 
peared his most striking work, a sort of philo- 
sophical epic, " Thus Spake Zarathustra " (the 
last part in 1892) ; in 1886, " Beyond Good 
and Evil "; a year later, " On the Genealogy 
of Morals "; and in 1888, " The Case of Wag- 
ner." In the latter year he also finished " The 
Twilight of the Idols," " The Anti-Christ," and 
a compilation of some of his former utterances 
on Wagner entitled " Nietzsche contra Wag- 
ner." But while these works were in the press, 
and while he was planning another philosoph- 
ical work of which the " Anti-Christ " is the 
first part, he succumbed to a nervous trouble 
under which his mind still remains clouded. 

In some of the works of Nietzsche's last stage, 
as in " Zarathustra " and his essays on Wagner, 
the irrepressible artistic instincts which so 
largely determine his individuality come to the 
front ; in all of them the views and convictions 
he had formulated in previous years find ex- 
pression so bold, often so felicitous, always so 
striking and so original, and his new thoughts 
are so extreme, that these works may be said 
to have started a sort of prairie-fire in the 
domain of thought, setting heaven and earth 
aflame and dazzling especially the immature. 
He tries to prove, especially in " Beyond Good 
and Evil " and in " Genealogy of Morals," that

our ideas of good and evil were formulated by 
the weak, the suppressed, the "slaves." "Good," 
in other words, is tantamount to harmless, " bad " 
to strong, powerful. The views of the conquer- 
ors, the strong, the admirable, the " glorious 
blonde beasts " who would call every exhibition 
of strength and of power " good," have been 
superseded by the views of those whom thou- 
sands of years ago the strong overcame, i. e. t 
of the weak who call " good " the traits char- 
acteristic of themselves, such as meekness, for- 
giveness, pity, etc. These revolutionary views 
Nietzsche does not base on a careful compara- 
tive study of morality, but on the etymology of 
a few words. The subject of morality, cer- 
tainly very complex, this extraordinary man 
tries to settle by a few dazzling intuitions. The 
rest of his " system " follows as a corollary. 
The contemptible morbidity, weakness, and 
lameness of modern society can be changed 
only by a return to the original view of things, 
to the belief that strength, power, health are 
good, even when destructive, a peculiar re- 
turn to nature. 

Everything in the history of politics, of 
morals, and of art, which is the expression of 
power or which fosters power, Nietzsche ad- 
mires ; everything which tames, he attacks with 
intense fierceness. Hence his profound hatred 
of Christianity. It came into being when the 
world was in a condition of decadence, and 
mirrors the views and longings, not of the 
strong, but of those craving pity ; it nurses the 
instincts, not of the strong and exuberantly 
healthy, but of the " slaves," the inferior, those 
possessing meekness, humility, patience, etc. 
It has systematically corrupted mankind. " Un- 
Christian," consistently powerful personalities 
and governments, powerful to brutality, call 
out his admiration. Caesar, Borgia, Napoleon, 
the Roman and the Russian governments, are 
his delight. In " Beyond Good and Evil," 
201, he goes so far as to say : " The history 
of Napoleon's effect is nearly equivalent to the 
history of the nobler form of happiness [des 
hoheren Gliicks] of which this whole century 
has been capable in its most valuable men and 
moments." In " Genealogy of Morals," 10, 
we read : " Not to be able to take seriously for 
more than a short time one's enemies, one's 
disasters, even one's crimes is a sign of strong, 
exuberant [votter~] individualities. Napoleon 
certainly belongs to that category. Hence his 
foible for criminals, as being untamed persons, 
and therefore generally superior to their judges. 
He says in the " Twilight of the Idols " (page 



128 of the translation before us) : " Anti- 
natural morality . . . (i. e., almost every mo- 
rality which has hitherto been taught, rever- 
enced, and preached) directs itself straight 
against the instincts of life, it condemns those 
instincts, sometimes secretly, sometimes loudly 
and insolently." His ideas of aesthetics are 
closely connected with those of morality. In 
" Joyful Science " he distinguishes between 
two kinds of art, one the expression of exuber- 
ance of health, the utterance of people suffering 
from an overplus of vitality, the other the expo- 
nent of stinted health and strength, the utter- 
ance of people suffering from lack of vitality. 
The latter yearn for self-oblivion through art, 
for peace and " a calm sea," or they wish to be 
intoxicated. We must be grateful to Nietzsche 
for this suggestive distinction. The true na- 
ture of that melodious wail in art which went 
up from all parts of Europe during the su- 
premacy of Romantic ideals is better under- 
stood when viewed from that standpoint. Yet 
we must not forget that the disease may be 
exquisitely artistic as, for example, with 
Lenau, the most poetical exponent of hopeless 
morbidity in Europe. 

A man so fond of exceptional individualities, 
so fond of born rulers, one who defines a 
truly noble (vornehm) person as " selfish, L e., 
sure that others must be his subjects," could 
not help being fiercely hostile to democratic 
institutions. Hence Dr. Brandes has cleverly 
called Nietzsche's system " aristocratic radical- 
ism," and Nietzsche himself regarded that view 
as excellent. In all his works he preaches 
theories directly opposed to the spread of de- 
mocracy. The whole idea running through his 
great and unique epic"Zarathustra" (namely, 
the breeding of " Beyond - Man ") is anti- 
democratic. Mankind in its present condition 
seems so unsatisfactory to him that he longs for 
beings as much above man as man is above the 
ape. This " Beyond-Man " (in German Ueber- 
mensck, the term is taken from Goethe and is 
found in " Faust " and elsewhere) is to be bred 
as horses are, or as Frederick William I. of 
Prussia is said to have planned breeding large 
soldiers. The whole plan shows the deep influ- 
ence of Darwinism.* Nietzsche utters some of 

* Mr. Tille, in the introduction to his translation, mentions 
several works in German literature in which similar principles 
prevail. The list is not complete. In 1810 Achim von Arnim 
introduced a character in his novel, "Die Grafin Dolores" 
(Vol. I., pp. 173-4) who selects superior men for fathers of her 
children. Her principle is " Nicht dass sich das Gleiche vom 
Gleichen entwickele, das ware unseres Lebens unwurdig, aber 
das Hohere soil erreicht werden." (This in 1810 !)

his profoundest and happiest thoughts in con- 
nection with this breeding-plan, and at every 
turn makes evident his deep contempt for the 
masses and his admiration for the superior few. 
Woman, for whom Nietzsche has inherited a 
puerile antipathy from his teacher, Schopen- 
hauer, plays a very inferior part in his scheme. 
She is merely to be a breeder of heroes. In 
different places Nietzsche attacks modern mar- 
riage as tending to cause the race to degenerate. 
It irritates him to see excellent men wasting 
themselves on inferior women. In one of his 
fits of fury he goes the length of saying, " Even 
concubinage has been ruined by marriage " ! 
If he means to insist on every person's making 
of himself or herself, by self-training and selec- 
tion, the substratum of a superior generation, 
he would have formulated a most valuable 
principle ; but as it now appears, his scheme is 
a dream, though a most interesting one. It is 
as much a proof of a pessimistic frame of mind 
as any of Rousseau's or Schopenhauer's ideas 
which he so violently attacks. As for his anti- 
democratic principles, they are simply a proof 
of his lack of historical sense. For ever since 
the Renaissance individuality has been devel- 
oping, and with it democratic institutions ; and 
they will so continue. 

What Nietzsche totally lacks is balance and 
a sense of completeness. The very form in 
which he moulds most of his thoughts namely, 
the aphorism is apt to lead to one-sidedness 
and exaggeration for the sake of effect. An 
aphorism is supposed to be the succinct formu- 
lation of a law, of a truth. As a matter of fact, 
like a proverb, it rarely tells more than a part 
of the truth. People with esprit are apt at coin- 
ing them, and people with esprit are bound to 
enjoy them. Yet they cannot satisfy us. What 
does our whole careful modern scientific work 
imply but a desire for completeness of knowl- 
edge, and how can anybody now hope to make 
a lasting impression whose thoughts do not bear 
the imprint of maturity and completeness? 
Wherever we turn in Nietzsche's work, we find 
brilliant half-truths. His whole " system " is 
one-sided. Many of his most brilliant sayings 
look for all the world like improvised convic- 
tions. He is a journalist among philosophers, 
and, like many journalists, he prefers his glit- 
tering utterances to the truth. Some of his 
sayings are like flashes that pain the retina. 
We cannot help being stimulated by a man who 
insists on strength and health as elements of 
supreme importance ; by one who loves life and 
hates pessimism, who admires not Renes, Wer- 



thers, and Manfreds, but " laughing lions "; 
but we must reject a thinker who so frightfully 
exaggerates his best thoughts. His admiration 
for health and strength is not the expression of 
a healthy mind (he himself confesses to being 
a "decadent," and every page of his works 
proves the correctness of that confession) ; they 
are probably a form of secret longing, like a 
hunchback's admiration for physical beauty. 
He was perhaps incapable of coping with the 
brutality of the world. It is certainly true that 
he was delicate and sensitive. Hence his whole 
system may be designated as pathological long- 
ing for health and hysterical yearning for seren- 
ity. We must regard it as sadly characteristic 
of our age that so powerful a plea for health 
should come from a diseased man. 

With all his admiration for brutal strength, 
Nietzsche is artist enough to appreciate refine- 
ment as few have ever done. He painfully 
feels the lack of exquisiteness in modern Ger- 
man life ; he genuinely admires French deli- 
cacy. What is more, few contemporaries, with 
the exception of men from certain circles in 
England, are capable of such profound vener- 
ation for the healthy refinement of Greek life 
and art as he exhibited in a series of lectures, 
delivered in Basel in 1872, on German higher 
institutions of learning. Here, as elsewhere, 
he lacks precisely that balance which more than 
anything else characterized his beloved Greeks ; 
but to few modern writers, especially in Ger- 
many, have the Greeks been a stronger active 
force in the direction of refinement than to the 
author of those lectures. Let anyone doubting 
that German prose can be a lucid and artistic 
medium of expression read and re-read them. 
Nietzsche had a sense of language denied most 
moderns. Some of his most stimulating apo- 
thegms deal with language ; and excepting Mr. 
Walter Pater's essay on style, I know of noth- 
ing so delightful as Nietzsche's views on that 
subject expressed in the lectures mentioned 
above. Unfortunately, in his later works his 
prose, at one time compact, lucid, calm, and 
refined, grew rhetorical, bombastic, tortured. 
The disciple of the Greeks became capable of 
astonishing aberrations. In his " Genealogy 
of Morals," for example, he once calls cer- 
tain modern historians "coquettish bed-bugs" 
(Kokette Wanzen) ! I should like to see 
Kokette Wanzen, merely from biological curi- 
osity. 

Nietzsche's keen sense of refinement clashes 
with his love for brute strength, and makes 
him guilty of a great piece of inconsistency.

For is refinement possible where people are not 
made " weak," or " meek " to a certain extent ? 
What is a refined civilization but the happy 
blending of exuberance and control ? 

Whatever we may urge against Nietzsche, 
we must admit that he has the gift of stimu- 
lating beyond most other authors. We may be 
offended by his opinions, but we cannot help 
remembering them. He lacks the historical 
sense altogether, and many of his views on 
eminent characters of the past (notably his 
hatred of Luther) are determined by this lack. 
Yet who would not be pleased with an author 
who so felicitously attacks the hysterically his- 
torical tendencies in modern intellectual life ? 
His style, we saw, became disagreeable in the 
course of time, but he never lost his power of 
fascinating. In all stages of his development 
he was capable of utterances so happy that one 
experiences almost physical pain at the thought 
that health and maturity were denied so rich a 
mind. What could more perfectly characterize 
the Greeks than his saying that " they were 
superficial from depth " i. e., that they neg- 
lected the unimportant from an unfailing sense 
of tact ? What could be more suggestive than 
his remark, " Ilfaut mediterraniser la musi- 
que," in other words, infuse into it more of the 
gayety and sunshine of the South ? (I should 
like to extend the idea contained in those words 
and say, " Ilfaut mediterraniser la vie," espe- 
cially in America.) Nietzsche's culture is phe- 
nomenal. When talented Germans aim at hu- 
manism (it is a rare occurrence) they do it with 
marked success. I may remind my readers of 
Herder, Goethe, and in these latter days of 
Victor Helm. Like many people with an excep- 
tional intellectual range, Nietzsche arrogates 
to himself opinions on subjects of which he is 
incompetent to judge. But his side-knowledge 
gives him an insight into recondite, though 
important, laws of which others know naught. 
He is bound to continue appealing to a genera- 
tion which suffers largely from lack of vitality, 
and hence wishes, to use his own words, to be 
intoxicated. Coming generations will see in 
him only the brilliant exponent of a tortured 
age. When shall we get again a great writer 
who, like Goethe or like Wordsworth, knows 
how to cull from life what is great and healthy 
in it, and be satisfied ? We may apply to Nietz- 
sche these words from " Faust ": 

" O Hoheit, Hoheit, wirst du nie 
Verniinftig wie allmachtig wirken ? " 

Mr. Alexander Tille deserves our gratitude 
for introducing so important a phenomenon in 



modern literature to the English - speaking 
world. His translation of " Zarathustra " is 
very satisfactory on the whole. It was no small 
matter to render into telling English Nietzsche's 
extraordinary language. Unfortunately, we 
cannot praise Mr. Common's translation of 
" The Case of Wagner," etc. It is bad through- 
out, and in parts ignominious. On page 9 we 
read, "In his art there is mixed . . . the 
things at present most necessary for every- 
body." On page 43, "The Germans, how- 
ever, have had enough of reason in their in- 
stincts to prohibit themselves every * if ' and 
* for ' in this matter." On page 55 we find 
" the romances of Dostoiewsky," meaning, of 
course, the novels. On page 236, " I know not 
out or in " (the original is Ich weiss nicht wo 
aus noch ein, i. e., I am perplexed in the ex- 
treme), etc. Such things ought never to be 
printed. CAMILLO VON KLENZE. 



A HISTORY OF ANCIENT CULTURE.* 

In this age of specialism it is interesting to 
meet with an author who gives himself the 
widest range in the treatment of a very large 
and intricate subject. It is no easy task to 
discuss the intellectual and religious history of 
the separate peoples of antiquity, and to esti- 
mate the position and contribution of each to 
the great whole. Such an undertaking has 
been assumed by Mr. Henry Osborn Taylor in 
two recent volumes entitled "Ancient Ideals." 
Everything has been done on the part of the 
publisher to make the discussion intelligible 
and attractive. The paper is clear, the type 
large, side-heads in black type analyze the con- 
tents of the chapters, a table of contents at the 
beginning summarizes each chapter, and an 
index at the end is sufficiently full to facilitate 
reference to special topics. 

After an Introductory chapter the following 
is the order of treatment: Egypt, Chaldaea, 
China, India, Iran, Greece, Rome, Israel, 
Christianity. A summary of the whole forms 
a concluding chapter. The fulness of treat- 
ment may be seen by enumerating the topics 
in the discussion of Greek ideals. The author 
begins with the earliest Greek civilization and 
follows with chapters on Homer, Greek prin- 
ciples of life, Greek art and poetry, Greek

philosophy, and later Hellenism over 350 
pages in all, in which there are many special 
studies of historical, religious, poetical, and 
philosophical questions. It is notable that a 
book dealing with ancient things, even the 
highest elements of the life of antiquity, at so 
great length, and with so evident enthusiasm, 
should be written and published in America, 
and by one who apparently holds no academic 
position. The culture of the republic is dis- 
tinctly enriched. One is encouraged to believe 
that the spirit of democracy is not entirely 
materialistic. 

The book illustrates also the courageous op- 
timism of the writer. Few men would dare 
attempt so comprehensive a work, requiring 
special knowledge at so many points, demand- 
ing the highest kind of attainment, as well as 
original genius, for its successful accomplish- 
ment. The author has used admirable discrim- 
ination in his choice of authorities for guidance 
in fields where he is not altogether at home. 
The translations employed are in most cases 
the most trustworthy, the views advanced upon 
general as well as upon special questions are 
for the most part those held by the best schol- 
ars. The amount of sound information and 
admirable discussion contained in these pages 
is worthy of particular mention. 

The author's standards are judicious and ap- 
preciative. He insists upon the recognition of 
human freedom. The movement of progress 
he regards as from society to the individual, 
and finally to a merging of both into the social- 
individual life. He recognizes at the same 
time the influence of environment, but insists 
that humanity brings something of itself into 
the environment, and is not altogether moulded 
thereby. Some things are by the author inter- 
preted by philosophical generalization which 
could be much more simply explained histor- 
ically. Too much emphasis is laid upon that 
very indefinite and unsatisfactory category, 
"race character." This is especially to be 
guarded against in the ancient world, where 
the mixture of races was so great and so con- 
tinuous. Space can hardly be taken for pre- 
senting the conclusions of the book. It may 
be enough to say that the writer finds in Chris- 
tianity the culmination of all ancient thinking ; 
it comprises all positive and valid elements of 
previous life and thought, and offers a synthesis 
of all ideals. It is absolute and universal. 

Having said all this, one is bound also to add 
that the book is not attractive or interesting. 
It is hard reading. The cause of this dryness 



does not lie in the subject, which is one of the 
most fascinating conceivable, and lends an in- 
terest from itself to the most prosaic interpre- 
tation, though its immense sweep involves 
difficulties of arrangement and presentation. 
The author's failure to produce a really great 
book is due primarily to his literary style, 
which is diffuse, obscure, choppy, often unin- 
telligibly ornate, careless in construction of 
sentences, tempted to the use of archaic and 
strange words, like the verbs " fare " (for 
" go ") and " greaten " (the latter a favorite 
word). A second defect lies in the failure to 
make any great central principles stand out 
and impress themselves. The author has been 
overborne by his materials. He has elaborated 
details to the obscuring of the main currents 
of thought. We are led on and on, from one 
topic to another, until we have lost the thread, 
and the impression left is a vague and unsatis- 
factory one. Perhaps the real difficulty is that 
the author has no definite philosophical system 
in harmony with which he orders his whole 
presentation. GEORGE S. GOODSPEED.

The attention of the literary world cannot 
fail to be attracted by the publication, in a 
handy form, of the " occasional papers " of so 
noted a man as the author of " The Oxford 
Movement" and "The Beginnings of the 
Middle Ages " a man who refused the prim- 
acy of the Church of England and, earlier, the 
arch-deaconry of Wells, and only reluctantly 
accepted the appointment of dean of St. Paul's, 
half inclining to continue his work as parson of 
the little village of Whatley in Somersetshire. 

Of the fifty- four essays contained in these 
two volumes, all but one "A Fragment on 
Elizabeth," the opening chapter of an intended 
life of Queen Elizabeth for the "English 
Statesmen " series appeared originally in 
either " The Guardian," " The Saturday Re- 
view," or " The Times." Forty-one of them 
are book reviews and criticisms, and most of 
the remainder obituary notices. Well versed 
in theology, philosophy, and history, both eccle- 
siastical and secular, the author combined the 
power of looking at large questions largely with 
the critic's nice sense of detail. That he writes,

however, from the orthodox and high-church 
standpoint is always apparent ; and this could 
hardly be otherwise, for the greater number of 
the essays were contributed to " The Guar- 
dian," a professedly high-church journal. Such 
being his point of view, anything like entirely 
unprejudiced criticism, in most of the subjects 
treated by him, is out of the question ; nor are 
we surprised by the writer's occasional slight 
tendency to digress along certain familiar or 
favorite lines of thought and study. With 
these few words on the essays as a whole, we 
will pass to a very brief consideration of some 
of the more important ones. 

The first is an extended review of Carlyle's 
" Cromwell," written on the occasion of the 
publication of the book. That it is decidedly 
adverse in its tone is no more than the reader 
expects ; but it is not harshly or dogmatically 
so. The characterization of Carlyle's style as 
an " interweaving of school-boy jargon and 
conversational familiarities with high-pitched 
declamation of an antique cast," is not alto- 
gether unjust. He points out the mistake which 
the book makes in " forcing home-bred English 
Puritans into full-blown divine heroes," and he 
contends that the writer's mind, as shown in all 
his works, " is not one of the deepest class. 
Breadth of painting not analysis, phenomena 
not their meaning, are his aim." 

In his review of Colonel Higginson's trans- 
lation of Epictetus, Dean Church, after pass- 
ing some strictures on the translator's too wide 
departure from a literal and accurate render- 
ing, undertakes to gauge the writings of the 
pagan philosopher by a comparison with the 
New Testament hardly a fair method of 
estimating their value. An unusually appre- 
ciative and scholarly review of Guicciardini's 
works forms one of the longer papers. The 
Dean's early life in Italy, where his first thir- 
teen years were passed, partly accounts for that 
familiarity with Italian literature which he 
shows here as well as in his book on Dante. A 
review of Lecky's " European Morals " follows 
the above, and shows considerable critical and 
philosophical insight. 

The chapter on " Ecce Homo ! " is some- 
what of a surprise, or was, we imagine, when 
it first appeared thirty-one years ago. This 
book has met with more censure, as well as 
commendation, from all sects and parties, in 
the church and out of it, than any other work 
of its kind. That " The Quarterly Keview," 
with its orthodox and conservative predilec- 
tions, should criticise the book in the harshest 



terms as unscholarly and irreligious, was to be 
expected, and that " The North American Re- 
view," in its thorough-going zeal for a liberal 
and enlightened Christianity, should " damn it 
with faint praise," was equally natural ; but 
here was " The Guardian," of well-known high- 
church prejudices, commending the book in no 
half-way terms and pronouncing it " a protest 
against the stiffness of all cast-iron systems, 
and a warning against trusting in what is worn 
out." With these words the reviewer summar- 
izes his opinion one of the earliest, if not the 
very earliest, published of the work which 
afterward drew forth an extended and com- 
mendatory review from Mr. Gladstone and 
notices innumerable from other writers. 

The chapters on Cardinal Newman are well 
worth reading, as being from the pen of one 
who formed a life-long intimacy with him dur- 
ing student days at Oxford and was his ardent 
admirer and follower up to his conversion to 
the Romish Church. Essays on Robertson, 
Maurice, Renan's writings, Lamennais, Fenelon, 
and Bossuet can be no more than mentioned 
here, while many other chapter headings which 
would still further whet the appetite, must be 
omitted altogether. An obituary notice on the 
author's uncle, Sir Richard Church, a general 
in the Greek army during the war for inde- 
pendence, will be read with interest at this time.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



A valuable 
new work on 



Mr. Sidney George Fisher's "The 
Evolution of the Constitution of the 
the comtituiion. United States " ( J. B. Lippincott Co.) 
is devoted to maintaining the thesis that our Con- 
stitution is " a development of progressive history, 
and not an isolated document struck off at a given 
time, or an imitation of English or Dutch forms of 
government." More definitely, holding that the 
Constitution " is neither an invention nor an imita- 
tion, but almost exclusively a native product of slow 
and gradual growth," Mr. Fisher has " undertaken 
to trace back through previous American documents 
to Colonial times every material clause of it." These 
documents he finds to be twenty-nine Colonial Char- 
ters and Constitutions, seventeen Revolutionary Con- 
stitutions, and twenty-three plans of Union, " in all 
sixty-nine different forms of government, which were 
either in actual or in attempted operation in Amer- 
ica during the period of about two hundred years, 
from 1584-1787." These documents " constituted 
the school of thought, the experiments, and the train- 
ing which in the end produced the National govern- 
ment under which we now live." Without attempt-

THE DIAL,

ing to certify to all the writer's conclusions, we have 
no hesitancy in certifying to his method, and to the 
general character of his results. There is a general 
resemblance between certain features of the govern- 
ment of the United States and the governments of 
other countries, particularly that of England ; but, so 
far as the peculiar features of our government are 
concerned, the sixty-nine documents studied by Mr. 
Fisher account for them, as he says, " in a more 
clear, complete, and satisfactory manner than any 
of the theories of sudden inspiration or imitation of 
England or Holland that have been broached." In 
our view, there is no theory that is now more seri- 
ously overworked by historians and legal and social 
philosophers than the resemblance or similarity 
theory. A writer notices a similarity between two 
institutions found in different countries, and, it may 
be, in different times, and leaps to the conclusion 
that there is some special causal connection between 
the two ; whereas the truth may be, and no doubt 
often is, that they are simply products of the human 
mind working under similar conditions. The nature 
of our Constitution has excited much study and 
some controversy since Mr. Gladstone said it was 
struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose 
of man. The lamented Alexander Johnston led the 
way into the field where the truth is to be found in 
his celebrated article published in " The New Prince- 
ton Review," "A Century of the Constitution." 
The present volume is a valuable contribution to the 
discussion sound in general method and rich in 
matter. All persons who have been led astray by 
the brilliant pages of Mr. Douglass Campbell's well- 
known work on the Puritan should read Mr. Fisher's 
last chapter, " Dutch Sources," which is a vigor- 
ous criticism of that writer's very taking but very 
unsubstantial theories. 

On the 20th of June Queen Victoria 
TwoVictorianbookt. will complete the sixtieth year of her 

reign, and she has already exceeded 
by several months the longest previous rule of any 
British sovereign. The year has seen the publica- 
tion of several books in commemoration of this fact. 
Sir Edwin Arnold's "Victoria, Queen and Em- 
press," which originally appeared in the "Daily 
Telegraph " of Sept. 23, 1896, has been reprinted 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. in a handy little 
book. It is professedly a panegyric, and is almost 
fulsome in its praises of the monarch for whose reign 
" History herself must find her tablets too narrow 
for any complete chronicle." Yet the writer records 
in a convenient and acceptable form many statistics 
illustrating the progress, since 1837, of the empire 
which now covers ten million square miles and 
claims the allegiance of three hundred and twenty 
million subjects. In recording the discovery of 
anaesthetics, the writer seems to divide the honor 
between Sir Joseph Simpson, of Edinburgh, and 
Doctors Morton and Wells, of our own country, 
while, as a matter of fact, Simpson's first use of 
anaesthetics in obstetric practice was in 1847, Mor- 



ton's application of the principle to dental surgery 
being made in the preceding year. Another Vic- 
torian book is Mrs. Sarah C. Tooley's " Personal 
Life of Queen Victoria," a not uninteresting com- 
pilation from various sources, published in this coun- 
try by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Unlike the book 
just mentioned, it is gossipy and anecdotal to an 
extreme, besides being even more unreservedly eulo- 
gistic of her whom the writer does not hesitate to call 
" our greatest monarch." But the account possesses 
a simple human interest which makes it worth read- 
ing. One little story, out of many, is too good not 
to give as illustrating the style of the book. The 
Queen was as strict in requiring from her children 
respectful conduct toward their elders as is any 
mother of humbler degree. Accordingly when Dr. 
Brown, of Windsor, entered Prince Albert's service, 
and the little princesses, hearing their father address 
him as " Brown," used the same mode of address, 
their mother corrected them and told them to say 
" Dr. Brown." All obeyed except little " Vicky," 
the princess royal, who was told that she would 
be sent to bed upon a repetition of the offence. 
But on the following morning, when Dr. Brown 
presented himself to the royal family, the little lady 
saluted him with, " Good morning, Brown," and 
then meeting her mother's eyes fixed upon her, she 
rose and with a courtesy continued, " and good night, 
Brown, for I am going to bed." With this she 
walked resolutely away to her punishment. The 
book is profuse in illustrations, good, bad, and indif- 
ferent, authentic and imaginative, all in half-tone. 

If some of the military details and 
Robert the Bruce, some of the weighing of authorities 

had been omitted in favor of more 
background, a fuller picture of the general life of 
the time, Sir Herbert Maxwell's account of Robert 
Bruce, the Scotch national hero (Putnams) would 
have been instructive enough and more entertaining. 
For in spite of the careful arraying and examining 
of the sources in the Introduction, in itself a very 
valuable chapter, the fact remains that a good part 
of the history is based on tradition. The chief ele- 
ment that a comparison of diplomatic records has 
added to the character of Bruce is that of an unscru- 
pulous perjurer. Yet as a criticism of the man this 
loses most of its weight in view of the further reve- 
lation that in this respect he was neither worse nor 
better than his contemporaries. The author well 
remarks : " Nothing is more remarkable in the po- 
litical history of this period than the freedom with 
which great men perjured themselves, except, 
indeed, the value which men continued to attach to 
the security of an oath." If the book had been 
intended chiefly for Scots, the details of family pedi- 
grees and of the descendants of Bruce, natural and 
otherwise, would have been more appropriate ; but 
to the general reader, or even to the Gael who has 
lost all track of his clan, there is rather too much of 
this " boast of heraldry." Or, at least, we would 
have been satisfied with the interesting series of 



1897.]

shields which constitute the head-pieces to the chap- 
ters. The volume partly supplies the lack of back- 
ground in the text by twenty excellent half-tones 
from photographs of the scenes of the hero's native 
land. What we hunger for constantly in reading 
such a biography as this is to realize what the life 
of the country was at the time, what filled the hearts 
and minds of the people, how they passed their days, 
and how this great leader influenced them and was 
influenced by them. Only with this knowledge can 
we really understand the hero himself. Yet it does 
not require a whole additional volume to supply this. 
A few such gleams as Froissart gives in his seven- 
teenth chapter, of the commissary methods of the 
Scotch soldiers, illuminate the whole matter. 



Lectures 
on French 
literature. 



The " Lectures on French Litera- 
ture" (Longmans, Green, & Co.), by 
Irma Dreyfus, were originally deliv- 
ered in French at Melbourne, Australia, where, as 
the author informs us in an introductory note, they 
" succeeded in popularizing French literature." We 
hardly think it likely that the same success will 
attend this translation, as the author hopes, " in all 
English-speaking countries." But the modesty of 
her pretensions disarms severe criticism. As we 
are warned at the outset not to expect " pedantic 
and wearisome dissertations," nor even instruction, 
and as the lectures profess to be only a " conscien- 
tious compilation," we cannot complain that they 
are superficial and unscientific, or that they make 
no contribution to our knowledge of the subject. 
They fulfil fairly their avowed aim of treating in 
a " light and familiar spirit " the principal epochs 
of French literature to the time of Moliere. They 
draw upon a considerable fund of literary anec- 
dote, and quote at length from the works discussed 
and from historical and critical authorities ; wherein 
lies whatever value they possess. But we suspect 
the critical competence of the author when she cites 
with equal respect and confidence Villemain, Sainte- 
Beuve, Taine, Hallam, Besant, and Buckle. We 
feel that we have a right to demand, even of books 
that aim only to popularize, clearness, accuracy, 
and reliability; and in these matters the lectures 
leave much to be desired. 



Eight excellent lectures, delivered 
bv Dr " Ge ? r S e Dodges before the 
Lowell Institute, discussing the social 
movements which are springing out of the new con- 
science of the church, appear in book form with the 
appropriate title " Faith and Social Service" (Whit- 
taker). Indifference, doubt, poverty, labor, moral 
reforms, the city, the divided church, these are the 
interesting themes. There is a good stock of epi- 
grams in the book, and not a dull page. The 
author's task is declared to be homilitical rather 
than academic. The lectures are meant to be inter- 
pretations of the thoughts of wise men out of the 
language of the schools into simpler speech ; of the 
researches of historians and of the arguments of 



/ . 
the Covenant. 



philosophers into the practical precepts of common 
life. Within the limits thus set, the book is fairly 
succe*. f ul. Two criticisms occur to one in following 
the ai\ ^ment. It is hardly accurate to say that 
creed-n\ :ing and church-making occupied a domi- 
nant plav,- in the early church. Ratzinger's account 
of the philanthropies of the early and mediaeval 
church should correct such extreme views. The 
charity of this century flows from an unbroken 
stream. There is the repetition of a current error 
on page 185 : " It is reported by statisticians that 
during the past forty years crime has increased five 
times as much as population." Will anyone show a 
state or a settled country where this is true? The 
suggestion rests on a misinterpretation of the census. 
A Chicagoan can forgive the hint (page 234) that 
Chicago would never be taken, like Jerusalem, for 
a symbol of heaven, after reading the delightful 
praise of the White City in an earlier page. It is 
more than hinted that if we made up our minds to 
it we might have a White City here all the time. 
The urgent plea for a sensible and practicable plan 
of church cooperation deserves attention. Dean 
Hodges speaks quite as much from direct experi- 
ence in work for wage-earners and the destitute as 
from books, and a sense of reality appears in every 
chapter. _ 

The century between 1650 and 1750, 

roughly speaking, is the Romantic 
6 , i r' mi i.* < 

Age of Scottish history. The life of 

that time has two strong elements, passionate faith 
and passionate loyalty ; the former is typefied in 
the Covenanter, the latter in the Jacobite. There 
are other romantic periods in the history of Scotland, 
indeed, that history is rarely without romance, 
but none that has inspired so much as this one. 
" Old Mortality " and " Waverley," " The Men of 
the Mosshags " and " Kidnapped," to mention but a 
few out of many, these four alone cannot be equalled 
by any four historical novels of other periods of 
Scottish history from the days of Bruce to our own. 
Of the two currents of life, the religious and the 
political, we are probably more familiar with the 
latter. In Mr. John Herkless' life of Richard 
Cameron ("Famous Scots Series," imported by 
Scribner), we may gather something of the man who, 
better than any other, sums up the former. The 
Cameronian was the extremist for the law of God, 
the forlorn hope for conscience, the martyr who 
nourished the seed of the Church. Of Richard 
Cameron's life, little is known ; he really began to 
live only after his death. His influence, and the 
wider influence of those who took his name, are 
matters which must be accounted for ; and yet the 
story of his life is hardly important. It is not until 
the Sanquhar Declaration that he becomes a great 
figure, and that but a month before the day of his 
death. Doubtless if biographic material were more 
plentiful we should see the heroic mind throughout ; 
but the lack of material is here an indication of lack 
of public impression. Mr. Herkless, though he could

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



not give us a portrait, has so far rent the shadows 
to use his own language as to leave the recog- 
nizable figure of a man. His book will be eagerly 
read by those interested in the time ; it gives a good 
view of the Presbyterian rebellion, and as much as 
could be gained of " The Lion of the Covenant." 

Mr. Laurence Hutton does himself 
Place* and people injustice when he gives the im- 

t Home. .J 6 

pression that his " Literary Land- 
marks of Rome " ( Harpers ) is written to give 
traditional sightseers " some idea of what the men 
who made Rome did in Rome." Mr. Hutton does 
not really care about the traditional sightseers ; he 
has a genial contempt for them. The people he 
writes of did not make Rome ; in fact, taking a 
batch as they come, Luther, Montaigne, Tasso, 
Galileo, Milton, they did rather more to unmake 
Rome. Nor does Mr. Hutton give much of an idea 
of what these men did in Rome ; he notes places 
where they stayed, lodging-houses or graves. His 
book may be of use to the traditional sightseer, 
although its chronological arrangement does not 
seem a help toward economy of time. But its real 
title to notice is not as a good or a bad guide-book : 
it is that it is amusingly written, a little vulgar in 
places, it is true, but on the whole in a tone that is 
light, graceful, and genial ; the material is handled 
with that easy skill for which Mr. Hutton is well- 
known. The mysterious contemporary of Balbus, 
Calpurnia regretting the opportunity denied to her, 
the poet Pliny, the crowd on the Piazza di Spagna, 
the Pope's Guards like "the Jack of Clubs in an 
Ulster," these modest figures linger in the memory 
and enliven the facts concerning literary people 
who lived in Rome. The illustrations by Mr. Du 
Mond are unequal, but the best have a good deal of 
charm. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Of the new volume (the third) of Professor W. M. 
Sloane's " Life of Napoleon Bonaparte," just sent out 
by the subscription department of the Century Co., 
there is little to be said beyond repeating our previous 
comments upon the elaborate and sumptuous manner 
in which this work is offered to the public. Meissonier's 
" Friedland " forms the frontispiece, and is but one of a 
number of superb colored plates included within the vol- 
ume. Other illustrations, in monotint or black and white, 
are scattered profusely through the pages, and admir- 
ably set off the dignified typography of the work. 
Messrs. McDonnell Brothers are the Chicago agents 
for this publication. 

Mr. Grant Richards, a new English publisher, has 
issued the first volume of a new year-book of politics. 
The title is " Politics in 1896," and the editor is Mr. 
Frederick Whelen. The contents include reviews of 
the English political year from the conservative, lib- 
eral, and socialist standpoints, written, respectively, 
by Mr. H. D. Traill, Mr. H. W. Massingham, and Mr. 
G. Bernard Shaw. Other sections are devoted to 
"Foreign Affairs," "The Services," "The United 



States" (by Mr. Albert Shaw), and "London." The 
book is both valuable for reference and interesting for 
reading, and may be obtained from the New York office 
of " The Review of Reviews." 

"The Vines of Northeastern America" (Putnam), 
by Mr. Charles S. Newhall, is a companion volume to 
the " Trees " and " Shrubs " of the same author. Nearly 
a hundred species are figured and described, many of 
them, however, being vines only in a very liberal sense 
of that term. We do not commonly think of Lycopo- 
dium clavatum or Galium aparine, for example, as vines. 
But the author was bent upon making a sizable book, 
and could not be exacting in his requirements. The 
outline illustrations are not wholly satisfactory, but will 
doubtless serve well enough for identification. 

The two stout volumes of Professor Lester F. Ward's 
"Dynamic Sociology" (Appleton) appear in a new edi- 
tion with an interesting preface. We learn from this 
preface that a Russian translation of the work had the 
signal distinction of being burned by the Council of 
Ministers at the instance of the Censor. . Mr. Ward 
has tried to find out just why it gave offence to the 
authorities, but the reports are contradictory. The text 
of the first edition (published in 1883) remains sub- 
stantially unchanged in the present issue. 



LITERARY NOTES.
