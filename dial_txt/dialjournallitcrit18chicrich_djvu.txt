ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. 

The death of Robert Louis Stevenson, on the 
third of December, in his South Sea Island 
home, is a grief to the whole English-speaking 
world. Wherever our tongue is spoken, in 
England and in America, in India, Australia, 
and South Africa, his name has been a house- 
hold word for at least ten years past, and his 
books have brought delight into countless lives, 
young and old. Now, that rare spirit has left 
its too frail tenement, and only a memory re- 
mains with those who loved him. Even the 
healing airs of the Pacific availed to prolong 
only for a few brief years the precious existence 
upon which disease had already fastened when 
Bournemouth was exchanged for Samoa ; but 
those years, few as they have been, have proved 
the most richly productive of his career, and 
our grief becomes the more poignant when we 
realize that he has been stricken in the very 
fulness of his powers, and when we think of 
what treasures one more decade of his life might 
have added to our literature. 

As it is, the list of Mr. Stevenson's books is 
a long one, longer than stands to the credit of 
many a writer who rounds out the scriptural 
tale of years. And when we consider, on the 
one hand, the physical disabilities under which 
the author labored, and, on the other, the fault- 
less workmanship as well as the prevailing man- 
liness and sanity of his output, we must reckon 
him among the most remarkable literary fig- 
ures of the time. He served a long and pain- 
ful apprenticeship to his art ; he waited until 
he felt himself well in hand ; and then, in spite 
of bodily conditions that would have daunted 
the will and quenched the ambition of the great 
majority of men, he began that steady stream 
of literary production whose flow was to cease 
only with his life. He would seem to have 
taken deeply to heart Spinoza's noble maxim 
that the free man thinks of nothing less than 
of death, and, with death for years staring him 
in the face, he asserted his spiritual freedom 
by writing volume after volume, in which the 
predominant note is one of cheer and in which 
the morbid finds scarcely a foothold. One 
thinks of Condorcet in prison, waiting for the 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



summons of the executioner, yet living " in an 
elysium that his reason has known how to cre- 
ate for itself, and that his love for humanity 
adorns with all purest delights." 

Mr. Stevenson, in spite of his excursions into 
other fields of literature, will be best remem- 
bered as a novelist. He has seemed, indeed, 
of late years to recognize that this was his true 
vocation ; and most of his recent work, as well 
as most of that planned for the immediate fu- 
ture, was in fiction. His novels are far from 
being of equal excellence. Some of them 
"Prince Otto," "The Black Arrow," "The 
Wrong Box," " The Wreckers," " The Ebb- 
Tide," must be regarded as relative failures 
with some insistence upon the relativity. The 
" Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," 
with all its fantastic psychological strength, is 
hardly to be ranked among the masterpieces. 
But of " The Master of Ballantrae," of " Kid- 
napped " and its sequel " Catriona," and of the 
best of the " New Arabian Nights " stories, 
there can be no question ; nor can there be any 
of " Treasure Island," equally good reading for 
young and old. Little fiction of the last ten 
yeare has so fair a chance of immortality as 
these books. 

Of the many volumes of miscellaneous prose 
other than fiction, it is hard to single out those 
most likely to live. Hardly one of them is 
without its admirers if not its zealous partisans. 
Among the collections of essays, the " Virgin- 
ibus Puerisque " volume has perhaps the warm- 
est place in the affections of the most discrim- 
inating readers. But let no one on this account 
neglect the " Familiar Studies of Men and 
Books," the " Memories and Portraits," or the 
papers gathered under the title of " Across the 
Plains." As for the altogether delightful books 
of travel, we find it impossible to choose be- 
tween "An Inland Voyage " and " Travels with 
a Donkey in the Cevennes." And of course a 
special word must be given to the group of 
books that deal with life in the Southern Seas, 
to the fiction of the " Island Nights Entertain- 
ments," to the fact of " A Footnote to History," 
and to the stirring verse of the " Ballads." In 
this connection, we instantly associate Mr. Stev- 
enson with Melville, and "Pierre Loti," and 
Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard ; and he seems 
to head the list. 

As for Mr. Stevenson's verse, while it is of 
no great consequence, yet it cannot be left un- 
mentioned. Besides the " Ballads " already 
alluded to, there is "A Child's Garden of 
Verse," that unique illustration of the projec- 



tion of an adult into a youthful mind, and the 
collection called " Underwoods," containing 
many charming poems of nature and of friend- 
ship, written in English and in Scots, and from 
which we must select as the writer's own sin- 
gularly fitting epitaph this lovely " Kequiem ": 

" Under the wide and starry sky, 
Dig the grave and let me lie, 
Glad did I live and gladly die, 
And I laid me down with a will. 

" This be the verse you grave for me, 
Here he lies where he longed to be, 
Home is the sailor, home from sea, 
And the hunter home from the hill." 

He has his wish now, for with the news of his 
death came the statement that he had been 
buried upon the summit of a mountain over- 
looking his Samoan home. 

The story of the dead writer's life may be 
simply told, and for it he has himself supplied 
the facts. Born in Edinburgh, November 13, 
1850, of a family of lighthouse engineers, he 
was destined for the ancestral calling. He 
attended school and university in Edinburgh, 
discovered that he did not want to be a civil 
engineer after all, tried the law, finding that 
equally distasteful, and determined to train 
himself for the profession of letters. At the 
age of twenty-three he began those wanderings 
in search of health that were to end only in the 
antipodes. We can trace these wanderings in 
his books, beginning with " Ordered South," 
and continuing the series through " Travels 
with a Donkey," " An Inland Voyage," " Across 
the Plains," and " The Silverado Squatters." 
The latter two books resulted from a steer- 
age trip to America in 1879, and a journey 
to the Pacific Coast on an emigrant train. 
While in San Francisco he married Mrs. Os- 
bourne. During the ensuing years, he lived 
at Bournemouth, in Scotland, and in various 
Continental resorts. In 1887 he made a sec- 
ond visit to America, and spent a winter in the 
Adirondacks. The summer following, he went 
to the Samoan islands, became so fascinated 
with the place that he purchased an estate, and 
settled down for the remainder of his days. 
How few those days were to be, we now know. 
But six years of domestic happiness and of 
healthful activity were no small boon for a man 
whose whole adult life had been a struggle for 
existence, and we doubt not he appreciated the 
blessing to the full. At all events his best was 
done in that peaceful retreat, and he himself 
was probably glad to accept it as his final rest- 
ing-place.

THE DIAL 



IBSEN'S NEW PLAY, "LILLE JSYOLF." 

Since the publication of "En Folkefiende" in 
1882, every second year has been marked by the 
appearance of a new play from the pen of Dr. Ibsen. 
Two years may seem a long time to be given to the 
composition of a prose drama that occupies less than 
two hours in the acting, and fills a printed volume 
of very modest dimensions ; but we are assured by 
the author's biographer that the two years really go 
to the making of the work, and that the final pro- 
duct is the result of a labor limce for which few mod- 
ern writers have the requisite patience. It is only 
after careful study that we may comprehend the in- 
finite pains bestowed upon every detail of these re- 
markable works, or realize that few poets give their 
verse the elaboration bestowed by Dr. Ibsen upon 
the polished prose of his dialogue. 

The new play, which has just been received from 
Copenhagen, and of which translations into English, 
German, French, Russian, Dutch, Hungarian, Bo- 
hemian, and Polish have been arranged, is entitled 
" Lille Eyolf ," and is in three acts. Coming after 
" Hedda Gabler " and " Bygmester Solness," it is a 
relief to the reader, for it is simpler in plan and 
more obvious in significance. Many of its passages 
are far-reaching in their implications, and strike 
into the very depths of the soul; but the reader is 
not all the time haunted by the suggestion of some 
elusive allegory, some hidden meaning that leads 
him a will-o'-the-wisp chase and lands him in a bog 
of conjecture. Even the most ardent of symbolists 
may possibly be content to take this play for what 
it is, and see in it nothing more than a direct tran- 
script of life under ideal conditions arranged by a 
consummate artistic sense. 

Alfred Allmers and his wife, Rita, have been mar- 
ried for some ten years, and have one child, a boy 
of nine, named Eyolf. The child has been crippled 
in infancy, and is just reaching the age when he real- 
izes the difference between himself and other boys 
sound of limb. The father, passionately attached 
to his child, has determined to devote himself to his 
happiness, and bring what harmony is yet possible 
into a life so unfitted to battle for itself. He thus 
states his new-found aim: 

" I will try to bring to light all the rich possibilities that are 
dawning in his childish soul. I will bring to full growth, to 
flower and fruit, every germ of noble purpose within him. 
And I will do more than that. I will help him to harmonize 
his wishes with what things are attainable by him. For now 
they are not in harmony. He longs for things that will be 
unattainable all his life long. But I will create joy in his 
mind." 

These plans are all broken off by the accidental 
drowning in the fjord of the child, whose winsome 
figure, like that of Mamillius in "The Winter's 
Tale," makes but the briefest appearance upon the 
scene, then passes from our sight, although never 
from our memory. 

The remaining two acts of the play are essentially 
a study of two women and their relations with All- 



mers. The one is his wife, the other Asta Allmers, 
supposed to be his half-sister. With the latter he 
has grown up from childhood in the closest inti- 
macy. Now, following close upon the loss of the 
child, comes the discovery that the supposed rela- 
tionship of brother and sister does not exist; and 
the other discovery, which both realize as by a light- 
ning flash, but which neither ventures to commit to 
words, that they are more to one another than even 
a brother and sister can be. This situation, which 
is treated with the greatest delicacy, closes the sec- 
ond act. 

Allmers. Asta ! What are you saying ? 

Asta. Head the letters. Then you will see and under- 
stand. And perhaps you will forgive my mother, also. 

Allmers. [Putting his hands to his head.] I cannot grasp 
it, cannot hold fast to the thought. You, Asta, then you are 
not ? 

Asta. You are not my brother, Alfred. 

Allmers. [Quickly, half-defiant, gazing upon her.] Well, 
but how does that alter our relations after all ? Not in the 
least. 

Asta. [Shaking her head.] It alters everything, Alfred. 
Our relation is not that of brother and sister. 

Allmers. No, no ! But as sacred for all that. It will al- 
ways be as sacred. 

Asta. Do not forget that you are subject to the law of 
mutability, as you said but now. 

Allmers. [Looking searchingly at her.] Do you mean by 
that ? 

Asta. [Quietly, but deeply stirred.] Not a word more, 
dear, dear Alfred. [Taking up some flowers from a chair.] 
Do you see these water-lilies ? 

Allmers. [Nodding slowly.] They are of the sort that shoot 
up far up from the depths. 

Asta. I picked them in the pool. There, where it flows 
out into the fjord.- [Holding them out to him.] Will you have 
them, Alfred? 

Allmers. [Taking them.] Thank you. 

Asta. [With tearful eyes.] They are like a last greeting 
to you from from little Eyolf. 

Allmers. [Gazing upon her.] From Eyolf out yonder ? Or 
from you ? 

Asta. [Softly.] From us both. Come with me to Rita. 

Allmers. [Taking his hat and murmuring.] Asta. Eyolf. 
Little Eyolf ! 

The character of Rita, the wife, is less transpar- 
ent than that of Asta, and her motives are not so 
easily laid bare. In the first act she is presented 
to us as attached to Allmers to the point of grudg- 
ing him his interest in his intellectual pursuits, his 
affection for his 'sister, and even his absorption in 
the child. She sees with delight the prospect of a 
marriage between Asta and a young engineer who 
has for some time been laying siege to the sister's 
heart. 

Rita. I should be very glad to see a match made between 
him and Asta. 

Allmers. [Discontented.] Why would you like that ? 

Rita. [With rising emotion.] Because then she would have 
to go far away with him. She could never come out to us the 
way she does now. 

Allmers. [Looking at her with amazement.] What ! Would 
you like to get rid of Asta ? 

Rita. Yes, yes, Alfred. 

Allmers. But why in all the world ? 

Rita. [Passionately throwing her arms about his neck.] 
Because then I should at last have you for myself alone. Yet 
not quite then even. Not wholly for myself. [Bursting into 
convulsive tears.] Oh, Alfred, Alfred I cannot give you up I

[Jan. 1, 



Allmers. [Gently freeing himself.] But, dearest Rita, be 
reasonable. 

Rita. No, I don't care the least bit about being reasonable. 
I care only about you. For you alone in the whole world. 
[Flinging herself upon his neck again.] For you, for you, for 
you ! 

Allmers. Let go, let go, you hurt me. 

Rita. [Releasing him.] If I only could. [With flashing 
eyes.] Oh, if you only knew, how I have hated you ! 

Allmers. Hated me ? 

Rita. Yes, when you sat in there by yourself, brooding 
over your work. Long, long into the night. [Plaintively.] 
So long, so late, Alfred. Oh, how I hated your work ! 

Allmers. But now I have given it all up. 

Rita. [Laughing harshly.] Indeed ! Now you are absorbed 
in something yet worse. 

Allmers. [Excited.] Worse ! Do you call the child some- 
thing worse ? 

Rita. [Vehemently.] Yes, I do.'! In the relation between 
us two, I call him that. For the child, the child is besides 
a living human being, he is. [With increasing agitation.] But 
I will not bear it, Alfred ! I will not bear it, and I tell you so ! 

Allmers. [In a low voice, looking fixedly at her.] I am 
almost afraid of you at times, Rita. 

Rita. [Darkly.] I am often afraid of myself. And for 
just that reason you must not arouse the evil in me. 

This scene strikes the keynote of Rita's character. 
She displays jealousy, undoubtedly, but jealousy of 
a complex sort, jealousy even more morbid than 
that passion usually is. The problem of the re- 
maining two acts is that of working out the effects 
of the child's death upon this passionate nature, and 
upon the nature, equally passionate in its depths 
but outwardly more restrained, of Allmers. 

To trace the process by which these stricken souls 
find peace would be impossible without translating 
the greater part of the two acts that follow. For 
peace finally comes or we are at least assured that 
its advent is imminent to her, through love, now 
first realized, for the memory of the lost child ; to 
him, through a deeper penetration into the mystery 
of life. At first dazed with grief, the future a blank 
to both, they instinctively turn to one another for 
help, and, in community of grief, grope towards that 
higher plane of thought and feeling which is attain- 
able by the courageous, but, perhaps, only through 
the refiner's fire of suffering. We leave them with 
the ascent well begun, and the goal dimly in view. 
Moved by a common impulse of altruism, they re- 
solve, thus bereft of their own child, to make bet- 
ter and brighter the lives of the village children 
about them, the very children who had made no ef- 
fort to save Eyolf from his fate. We translate the 
beautiful scene with which the play ends : 

Allmers. What do you really think you can do for all these 
poverty-stricken children ? 

Rita. I will try to see if I cannot soften and ennoble 
their lot. 

Allmers, If you can do that, little Eyolf was not born in 
vain. 

Rita. Nor in vain taken from us. 

Allmers. [Looking fixedly at her.] Have no illusion upon 
one point, Rita. It is not love that impels you to this course. 

Rita. No, it is not that. At least not yet. 

Allmers. What is it, really ? 

Rita. [Half evasively.] You have so often talked to Asta 
about human responsibility 

Allmers. About the book you hated. 



Rita. I still hate the book. But I sat and listened when 
you spoke. And now I want to test myself. In my own way. 

Allmers. [Shaking his head.] It is not for the sake of the 
unfinished book ? 

Rita. No, I have a reason for it. 

Allmers. What ? 

Rita. [With a melancholy smile.] I want to find favor in 
those big, open eyes, you see. 

Allmers. [Resolutely, fixing his gaze upon her.] Could I 
not be with you, and help you, Rita ? 

Rita. Would you ? 

Allmers. Yes, if I only knew that I could. 

Rita. [Lingeringly.] But then you would have to stay 
here. 

Allmers. [Gently.] Let us try to make it succeed. 

Rita. [In a barely audible voice.] Let us try, Alfred. 

[Both are silent. Allmers goes to the staff and raises the 
flag that has floated at half-mast. Rita watches him in si- 
lence.] 

Allmers. [Coming back to her.] There is a hard day's 
work before us, Rita. 

Rita. But you shall see the peace of the sabbath fall upon 
us once more. 

Allmers. [With quiet emotion.] Perchance we shall have 
visits from the world of spirits. 

Rita. [Whispering.] Spirits? 

Allmers. Perchance they are about us those we have lost. 

Rita. [Nodding slowly.] Our little Eyolf . And your big 
Eyolf too. 

Allmers. [Gazing into space.] Perhaps on our way through 
life we may now and then catch some glimpses of them. 

Rita. Where shall we look, Alfred ? 

Allmers. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] Above. 

Rita. [Nods in assent.] Yes, yes, above. 

Allmers. Above toward the mountain-peaks. Toward 
the stars. And toward the great silence. 

Rita. [Stretching out her hand to him.] Thank you. 

In this lovely scene, and in the play of which it is 
the ending, we find once more the Ibsen that to 
some of us, at least, has seemed wellnigh lost of re- 
cent years, the idealist of " Brand " and " Peer 
Gynt," the ethical leader who has preached so many 
sermons upon the theme of losing life for the sake 
of saving it. For this play is but another illustra- 
tion of the text, 

" Evigt ejes kun det tabte," 
which is the real subject of so many of Dr. Ibsen's

ENGLISH LITERATURE IN AMERICAN 

LIBRARIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The rapidly increasing interest in the study of English 
literature in American schools and universities, and the 
recent suggestion in THE DIAL that the leading specialty 
of the new Crerar Library should be English literature 
in the broad sense of the term, lends renewed value to 
the statistics and statements contained in the " Notes 
on Special Collections in American Libraries " issued 
from the Harvard College Library. From this docu- 
ment I summarize briefly the descriptions of the chief 
collections in English literature as reported from all the 
great libraries of the country except the Library of 
Congress at Washington. 

The best general collections are probably those at 
Harvard, in the Boston Public Library, in the Lenox 
Library at New York including the Duyckinck collection 
of 15,000 volumes in literary history, and in the Sutro 
Library at San Francisco. Considerable collections also 
exist at the University of California; at Johns Hopkins 
(especially complete in regard to Beowulf) ; at Lafayette 
College (Professor March's collection in Old and Mid- 
dle English, said to be " nearly complete for Anglo- 
Saxon ") ; in the Massachusetts Historical Society's Li- 
brary, Boston, including the Dowse collection of " best 
editions and rarities in English literature"; at the Uni- 
versity of Vermont (the George P. Marsh library) ; the 
collection of periodicals and of transactions and publi- 
cations of learned societies in the Chicago Public Library ; 
at Dartmouth College; the material originally used by 
Noah Webster in preparing his dictionary, belonging to 
the Hartford Library Association; and a few others of 
less importance. 

In addition to those specified above, the chief special 
collections are as follows: The Barton collection in the 
Boston Public Library, nearly 14,000 volumes, mostly 
Shakespeariana and rare editions of English Drama and 
Poetry. The Shakespeare collection of 1000 volumes 
in the Lenox Library, including all the early editions. 
Other Shakespeare collections as follows: The Wisconsin 
State Historical Society, 1200 volumes ; the Mercantile 
Library, Philadelphia, 1200 volumes (Shakespeare and 
the Drama); the Columbia College Library, 700 vol- 
umes; the St. Louis Public Library, 600 volumes; the 
Peabody Institute, Baltimore, 500 volumes; the Brown 
University Library, 400 volumes, including many rare 
pamphlets; and the recently acquired collection at the 
University of Michigan. Harvard, Columbia, and the 
Lenox have also considerable collections on Milton. The 
folk-lore collection of 5800 volumes at Harvard is " sup- 
posed to be the largest in existence." Harvard also has 
valuable Shelley and Carlyle MSS. and books. The 
Boston Athenaeum has a Byron collection of over 200 
volumes. Lafayette College has special collections on 
Priestley, De Foe, Junius, etc. The Lenox Library has 
a fine collection of incunabula, including a portion of the 
first English printed book, 1474, and other specimens 
of Caxton and the early English printers. 

Viewing these summaries as a whole, it is evident that 
there is nowhere in the United States any really satis- 
factory and fairly complete collection in the great field 
of English literature. A few special collections offer a 
promising beginning in one or more narrow parts of the 
field, but extended study and research over any wide 



area is hardly possible in this country. Of course no 
American library could ever hope to rival the British 
Museum or the Bodleian in their particular field, but 
it is a disgraceful lacuna in the endowment of American 
scholarship that research in almost any direction (except 
perhaps in Shakespeare study and in one or two mod- 
ern subjects) demanding any but the simplest and most 
elementary materials can only be prosecuted abroad. 
In no field except that of history and literature is one 
of the chief documents of history are great collections 
of books so necessary as in the study of literature, and 
the most universal of the arts will never attain to its 
proper dignity in American civilization until adequate 
material means for its fostering and promotion are af- 
forded. The Crerar Library could supply no greater 
need than by a collection of the literature of the En- 
glish tongue.

THE PERILOUS USE OF UNKNOWN TONGUES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A great many people firmly believe that a knowledge 
of Latin is not at all necessary in order to get through 
this life successfully, but one might suppose that all 
would agree as to the necessity of such a knowledge to 
anyone who attempts to use the language. The sorry 
plight into which some of the Columbian Exposition 
officials were thrown by the lack of this knowledge has 
been pointed out by one of your correspondents. Let 
me call attention to a few similar cases of unsuccessful 
wrestling with an unknown tongue. In a ponderous 
work on the " Principles of Economic Philosophy," pub- 
lished several years ago, the principle "omnium vivum 
ex ovo " is stated, and, as if purposely to clear the 
printer of blame, we have as its counterpart " omnium 
ovum ex vivo." Perhaps nothing better should be ex- 
pected from a work on political economy published in 
the midst of a campaign, but it is only a few months 
since no less a magazine than " The Atlantic Monthly " 
was guilty of " omm'a Gallia," in quoting from the first 
sentence of Caesar's Commentaries ! By the help of 
Mrs. Partington, with her " omnibi," the process of re- 
duction from the third to the first and second declen- 
sions is complete for all genders, though the stems do not 
happen to coincide. But this is not all; along comes 
" The Cosmopolitan" with " monstrum informwm ingeus," 
which would have been much more terrible to Vergil 
than was Polyphemus to ^Eneas. " Ad valorwm," on 
the editorial page of " The Independent " a few years 
ago, may have been a mere typographical error; but 
" ex unwm quadraginta " (of the number of dishes of 
soup from one can of some new preparation), which I 
culled from a polyglot street-car advertisement in Bal- 
timore, is doubtless to be ascribed to the same cause 
operating in the other instances mentioned : crass ignor- 
ance of the language. Horace says: 

" Ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis," 
which offers a very important suggestion to those who 
attempt to use Latin without some little knowledge of 
its forms. 

Since writing the above, I have received the Decem- 
ber " Education " (fresh from Boston /) with the informa- 
tion (p. 255) that Gudeman's " Dialogus de Oratoribus " 
contains " a prolegomena."

MOKE MEMOIRS OF LITERARY 

The qualities that won for Mrs. Anne Thack- 
eray Ritchie's "Records of Tennyson and Brown- 
ing " so cordial a welcome on both sides of the 
Atlantic are once more pleasantly in evidence 
in her " Chapters from Some Unwritten Me- 
moirs." Essentially the volume is a retrospect 
of the author's girlhood, which seems to have 
been divided pretty evenly between London and 
Paris, and the opening sentence sounds its key- 
note : 

" My father lived in good company, so that even as 
children we must have seen a good many poets and re- 
markable people, though we were not always conscious 
of our privileges." 

Mrs. Ritchie opens the series of pen-portraits 
which form the staple of her book with a lively 
sketch of her "first poet," Jasmin (Jaquou 
Jansemin, in the langue d' Oc), the barber-poet 
of Agen. She met Jasmin at a party given in 
his honor by Lady Elgin at Paris ; and the 
outer man of the tonsorial bard fell wofully 
short of her young ideal. She had learned at 
school some of his beautiful verses, and her 
fancy had painted a poet to match something 
in the Byrouic way, with a distinctive touch 
of " the warm South " superadded. But alas ! 
when the real Jasmin dawned upon her at Lady 
Elgin's rout, it was no belated troubabour that 
she saw, but a stout jovial figure like an over- 
ripe Bacchus a jolly, red, shining face, with 
round prominent features, framed with little 
pomatumy wisps of hair (smacking all too 
plainly of the shop), and a Falstaffian torso 
clad in a gorgeous frilled shirt over a pink lin- 
ing. She could have cried for vexation. It 
was her first illusion perdue. 

" That the poet ? not that,' I falter, gazing at 
Punchinello, high-shouldered, good-humored. ' Yes, of 
course it 's that,' said a little girl, laughing at my dis- 
may; and the crowd seems to form a circle, in the cen- 
tre of which stands this droll creature, who now begins 
to recite in a monotonous voice." 

Mrs. Ritchie understood French pretty well 
at the time ; but of Jasmin's jiatois she could 
make nothing. To her untrained ear the reci- 
tation was a meaningless " cAi, cAa, chou, at- 
chiou, atchiou, atchiou," a kind of mellifluous 
ProvenQal sneeze, to the rhythm of which the 
ample shirt-frill beat time, as the voice rose and 
fell. It leaves off at last, and there is a moment 
of silence, and then a buzz of low- voiced ad-

miration. She sees Punchinello (freely per- 
spiring and more shiny and rubicund than ever) 
led up the hostess to be congratulated and 
thanked and patronized, and then handed round 
to the company severally, like a sort of refresh- 
ment ; and the entertainment is over. 

" As we move towards the door again, we once more 
pass Mr. Locker (of the 'London Lyrics '), and he nods 
kindly, and tells me he knows my father. ' Well, and 
what do you think of Jasmin?' he asks; but I can't 
answer him, my illusions are dashed. ... I who had 
longed to see a poet ! who had pictured something so 
different ! I swallowed down as best I could that gulp 
of salt-water which is so apt to choke us when we first 
take our plunge into the experience of life." 

Yet Mrs. Ritchie had been that evening in 
a throng of poets, as she learned later ; for 
Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Girardin, Merimee, 
and some others, were of the company. And 
he too of the red face and the shirt-frill was a 
poet a poet of the people, writing from his 
heart in his own dialect ; one of the school, as 
Sainte-Beuve says, of Horace, and of Theocri- 
tus, and of Gray, and " of all those charming 
studious inspirations which aim at perfection 
in all their work." 

It was at Paris, also, that Mrs. Ritchie met 
her first musician ; and here there was no dis- 
illusionment. She accompanied, one morning, 
as she relates, a friend of her grandmother's on 
a visit to the lodgings of one whose name and 
identity were not at first made known to her. 
The friend was a Scotch lady of rank, who to 
the harshest of exteriors joined the mildest of 
souls ; and her errand on this occasion was 
plainly one of kindness, for there was a large 
basket in the carriage containing a store of 
viands and bottles. Arrived at a small house 
in a side street near the Arc de Triomphe, the 
carriage stopped, and the lady got out, care- 
fully carrying her parcel. The door was opened 
by a slight delicate-looking man with long hair, 
strangely bright eyes, and a thin hooked nose. 

" When Miss X. saw him she hastily put down her 
basket, caught both his hands in hers, began to shake 
them gently, and to scold him in an affectionate reprov- 
ing way for having come to the door. He laughed, said 
he had guessed who it was, and motioned her to enter, 
and I followed at her sign with the basket followed 
into a narrow little room, with no furniture in it what- 
ever but an upright piano and a few straw chairs stand- 
ing on the wooden shiny floor. He made us sit down 
with some courtesy, and in reply to her questions said 
he was pretty well. Had he slept ? He shook his head. 
Had he eaten ? He shrugged his shoulders and pointed 
to the piano. He had been composing something I 
remember that he spoke in an abrupt, light sort of way 
would Miss X. like to hear it? ' She would like to hear 
it,' she answered, ' she would dearly like to hear it; but it 
would tire him to play ; it could not be good for him.' "

He smiled again, shook back his long hair, and 
=seated himself at the piano ; and instantly the 
room was filled with a rain of continuous sound, 
a fluent stream of rippling melody that rose 
and fell, and swelled and died away again, until 
the strained ear scarcely caught its echo. There 
was a magician at the keys. 

" The lady sat absorbed and listening, and as I looked 
:at her I saw tears in her eyes great clear tears rolling 
down her cheeks while the music poured on and on. I 
can't, alas, recall that music ! I would give anything 
to remember it now; but the truth is I was so interested 
in the people that I scarcely listened. When he stopped 
at last and looked tound, the lady started up. 'You 
mustn't play any more,' she said; 'it's too beautiful' 
and she praised him in a tender, motherly, pitying sort 
of way, and then hurriedly said we must go; but as we 
took leave she added almost in a whisper with a humble 
apologizing look ' I have brought you some of that 
jelly, and my sister sent some of the wine you fancied 
the other day; pray try to take a little.' He again 
shook his head at her, seeming more vexed than grate- 
ful. 'It is very wrong; you shouldn't bring me these 
things,' he said in French. 'I won't play to you if you 
do ' but she put him back softly, and hurriedly closed 
the door upon him and the offending basket, and hast- 
ened away." 

The player was Chopin. " Never forget," said 
Mrs. Ritchie's companion, " that you have heard 
Chopin play ; for soon no one will ever hear 
him play any more." 

Mrs. Ritchie's historian, or rather her " pro- 
fessor of history," was not a Thiers, or a Guizot, 
or even a Lamartine. It was a certain quaint old 
body who, for the behoof of very young ladies, 
made a feint at giving historical lectures, keep- 
ing herself laboriously a chapter or so ahead 
of her pupils, and plunging (Mrs. Ritchie re- 
members) into the bloody chaos of the Merov- 
ingian and Carolingian times with a zest com- 
ically at odds with her own appearance. This 
Madame P., whose purse was even leaner than 
her lectures, is the heroine of a pleasant story 
of Thackeray, the truth of which is now vouched 
for by his daughter. 

" When my father came to Paris to fetch us away, he 
was interested in the accounts he heard of the old lady 
from his mother and cousin. ... I was sent one day 
to search for a certain pill-box in my father's room, of 
which he proceeded to empty the contents into the fire- 
place, and then, drawing a neat banker's roll from his 
pocket, to fill up the little cube with new napoleons, 
packing them in closely up to the brim. After which, 
the cover being restored, he wrote the following prescrip- 
tion in his beautiful even handwriting :' Madame P. . . . 
To be taken occasionally when required. Signed, Dr. 
W. M. T.' " 

Years after, when Paris was besieged by the 
Germans, and Madame P. was in sorer straits 
than ever before, " Dr. W. M. T.'s " generous 
prescription was repeated this time in the 



form of a draft on the Rothschilds. It was 
learned later, however, that the beleaguered old 
lady had scorned to apply the money to the 
purchase of luxuries above the horrible frican- 
deaux and salmis of rats and mice to which her 
neighbors were reduced, subscribing it rather, 
as she proudly said, " to the cannon which were 
presented by our quartier to the city of Paris." 

" My father," observes Mrs. Ritchie, " had 
a weakness for dandies." Magnificent speci- 
mens of the " Dandiacal body " used to cross 
her vision sometimes, as they passed through 
the hall to the study ; but there was one that 
outshone the rest as the sun the stars in bright- 
ness. This splendid person, she remembers, 
had a little pencil-sketch in his hand ; and it 
seemed to her impossible that so grand a being 
could be so feeble a draughtsman. 

" He appeared to us one Sunday morning in the sun- 
shine. When I came down to breakfast I found him 
sitting beside my father at the table, with an untasted 
cup of coffee before him; he seemed to fill the bow- 
window with radiance as if he were Apollo; he leaned 
against his chair with one elbow resting on its back, with 
shining studs and curls and boots. We could see his 
horse looking in at us over the blind. It was indeed a 
sight for little girls to remember all their lives." 

It was indeed ; for the visitor was Count D'Or- 
say the brilliant being who (as Richard Doyle 
relates) so impressed a literary man of the day 
that the latter was heard to roar out in dismay 
at a city banquet where D'Orsay was present, 
above the din of aldermanic gabbling and gob- 
bling, " Waiter ! for Heaven's sake bring melted 
butter for the flounder of the Count ! " He could 
not bear that the waiter's omission should rest 
as a blot upon his country's cookery. 

No literary memoir of the period would be 
complete without a glimpse of the Carlyles. 
Mrs. Ritchie first saw the sage at a dinner at 
her father's, given for Miss Bronte ; and she 
remembers him then chiefly as railing at the 
appearance of cockneys upon Scotch mountain- 
sides. There were also too many Americans 
there for his taste ; " but the Americans were 
as gods compared to the cockneys," he kindly 
added. Later, the old house in Cheyne Row 
(the Mecca of Carlyle's " millions of trans- 
atlantic bores "), became a familiar spot to her ; 
and here she heard from the lips of Mrs. Car- 
lyle many stories that have since strayed into 
print. " If," said the poor lady pathetically 
on one occasion, " if you wish for a quiet life, 
never you marry a dyspeptic man of genius." 
" I remember," Mrs. Ritchie adds, " she used 
to tell us how, when he first grew a beard, all 
the time he had saved by ceasing to shave he

spent wandering about the house, and bemoan- 
ing that much was amiss in the universe." If 
Mrs. Carlyle was, as tradition says, a shade 
nearer Xanthippe than Griselda, there was as- 
suredly much in her universe to explain and 
palliate the fact. 

Mrs. Ritchie's notes on the Carlyles close 
with a characteristic little story that will bear 
re -telling. It seems that irreverent thieves 
having broken into the sanctuary at Chelsea 
and carried off the dining-room clock, it was 
arranged by some of the then aging philoso- 
pher's friends to formally present him with a 
new one. Lady Stanley was elected spokes- 
woman on the occasion : 

" It was Carlyle's birthday, and a dismal winter's day; 
the streets were shrouded in greenish vapors, and the 
houses looked no less dreary within than the streets 
through which we had come. Somewhat chilled and 
depressed, we all assembled in Lady Stanley's great 
drawing-room in Dover Street, where the fog had also 
penetrated, and presently from the farther end of the 
room, advancing through the darkness, came Carlyle. 
There was a moment's pause. No one moved. He 
stood in the middle of the room without speaking. No 
doubt the philosopher as well as his disciples felt the influ- 
ence of the atmosphere. Lady Stanley went to meet him. 
' Here is a little birthday present we want you to accept 
from us all, Mr. Carlyle,' said she, quickly pushing up 
before him a small table upon which stood the clock 
ticking all ready for his acceptance. Then came another 
silence, broken by a knell, sadly sounding in our ears. 
' Eh, what have I got to do with Time any more ? ' he 
said. It was a melancholy momenjt. Nobody could 
speak. The unfortunate promoter of the scheme felt 
her heart sink into her shoes." 

But we have quoted enough from Mrs. 
Ritchie's pleasant and, in its light way, mat- 
terful little book to show its scope and tenor. 
Other chapters treat of further Paris and Lon- 
don memories, of tours on the continent, includ- 
ing a visit to Weimar, of " Mrs. Kemble," etc.; 
and there are pleasant glimpses throughout of 
Thackeray and his circle. E. G. J. 



MlKABEATJ AND THE FRENCH REV- 
OLUTION. * 

In the prefatory note to the two volumes con- 
taining the twelve lectures recently delivered 
by Professor Von Hoist before the Lowell In- 
stitute, the distinguished author asks readers 
and critics to take the pages for what they pur- 
port to be : not a book on the French Revolu- 
tion, but merely some lectures on it, given under 
prescribed limits. These lectures were pre- 

* THE FRENCH KE VOLUTION, Tested by Mirabeau's Career : 
Twelve Lectures on the History of the French Revolution. 
By H. Von Hoist. In two volumes, with portrait. Chicago : 
Callaghan & Co. 



pared for delivery before a great popular audi- 
ence, such as a forceful speaker of eminent 
reputation always commands in the lecture-hall 
of the Lowell Institute. Before such an audi- 
ence the lecturer had a right to assume that 
there were only a few who had made a special 
study of the Revolution, sufficient to enable 
them to follow the presentation of a single phase 
of the great movement without much prelim- 
inary explanation. The first six lectures, con- 
cerning the causes of the Revolution, were 
therefore given mainly as an introduction, to- 
prepare the audience for what the lecturer had 
to say about Mirabeau, for whom he has a de- 
cided partiality. 

The main interest in these volumes opens 
with the seventh lecture, on the party of one 
man, the fourth party in the Assembly, Mira- 
beau. " Yes," says the author, " and [he] not 
only was a party of himself, but he knew be- 
forehand that it would be so, and was deter- 
mined that it should be so." In that assembly 
of twelve hundred deputies there were many 
of the best as well as most illustrious men in 
France ; or, as La Marck says, all the capac- 
ities, talents, energy, and spirit in the kingdom. 
Mirabeau was then forty years old. He was 
the best-known man in that period of the Rev- 
olution. His abilities were of the highest order. 
He was the greatest orator in the Assembly. 
It is claimed that he was its greatest practical 
statesman. I cannot think that he desired to 
stand alone in the Assembly, having no party 
affiliations and wanting none. No one under- 
stood better than Mirabeau the difficult public 
questions that awaited solution. And no one 
understood better than he that even in public 
assemblies such questions can be solved best 
by a union of influential men acting together 
for a common purpose. The power to bring 
about such effective combinations is at least one 
of the best-known tests of practical statesman- 
ship. Nothing seems clearer than that Mira- 
beau desired to be a leader of a party in the As- 
sembly. He desired especially, while retaining 
his seat as deputy, to be in the ministry, where 
he would have the privilege of approaching the 
king openly, and not, as the privilege was only 
once accorded to him, of approaching the king 
secretly and by a private door. It is because 
he was a party by himself, and not because he 
determined to be so, that his desire was never 
gratified. Under the law of November 7, 1789, 
members of the Assembly could not enter the 
ministry. When that door to his ambition was 
closed, he passed the remainder of his life in- 



1895.]

vain efforts to make combinations with influen- 
tial men to secure for himself a secret position 
behind the throne, from which, without any 
department for himself, his unseen hand should 
direct all the departments, through a king who 
had no will and no fixed purpose except to re- 
ceive from Rome his directions and from the 
armies of Europe his defence. Rivalry, jeal- 
ousy, and the inability of Frenchmen to appre- 
ciate statesmanship, have been assigned as 
reasons for his failure. The explanation is not 
adequate ; for it is not true. Frenchmen are 
not wanting in magnanimity. Mirabeau him- 
self explained the cause of the difficulty, often 
saying : " Ah ! how the immorality of my youth 
injures the public weal." His conduct during 
the Revolution completes the explanation. His 
life, from beginning to end, is a significant 
illustration of the fact that character, such as 
Washington's or Hampden's, is more influential 
ven in popular assemblies than oratory and 
talent. Arthur Young says : " In every com- 
pany, of every rank, you hear of Count Mira- 
beau 's talents ; that he is one of the best pens 
in France, and the first orator ; and that he 
<3ould not carry, from confidence, six votes in 
the states." This explanation was satisfactory 
to Mirabeau's contemporaries. It has been 
generally accepted by eminent writers on the 
Revolution, from that day to our time. It is 
not accepted by Professor Von Hoist, who 
seems to think that the time has not yet come 
ior full justice to Mirabeau. 

It is claimed that the immorality of his youth 
was such as was common in that time ; but that, 
when he entered public life at the time of the 
Revolution, his ambition was aroused, he became 
a new man, and the immorality of his youth 
should not be counted against him. Unfor- 
tunately, venality, the vice of his public life, 
is one that is more destructive to the founda- 
tions of public welfare than all the vices of his 
youth. Mirabeau's failure to win the confi- 
dence of his contemporaries will not be under- 
stood when his vices in public and in private 
life shall have been forgotten. The account of 
Mirabeau's venality is given in the writings of 
La Marck with coloring as favorable as honest 
friendship could use. They knew each other 
prior to the Revolution. They were both in 
the National Assembly. Meeting in the As- 
sembly, Mirabeau made the first advances, ask- 
ing La Marck to sound the court, and saying 
to him : " Let them understand at the chateau 
that I am more disposed towards them than 
against them." In that interview, and in sub- 



sequent ones, the purpose of La Marck was 
formed. He says : " I wished to contribute to 
the preservation of the throne, as to the defence 
of the unhappy king who occupied it. To bring 
to the cause of the king Count Mirabeau, who 
seemed to be the most violent and the most dan- 
gerous enemy of the throne, to put him in the 
rank of its most powerful defenders, seemed to 
me to be an essential service to render." To 
effect this service La Marck had many inter- 
views with the queen, and, finally, one with 
both king and queen. " When the king en- 
tered," says La Marck, " without any preamble 
and with his usual brusqueness, he said, ' The 
queen has told you that I have decided to em- 
ploy Count Mirabeau, if you think it is in his 
intentions and in his power to be useful to me.' " 
After some suggestions by La Marck, to the 
effect that all the revolutionary chiefs might 
be induced to enter into the service of the king, 
the suggestions in relation to the other chiefs 
being ignored, the king said that what should 
be done with Mirabeau must be kept a profound 
secret from the ministers. It was then agreed 
that the king should pay the debts of Mirabeau, 
amounting to 208,000 francs, allow him 6000 
francs a month for his expenses, and should de- 
posit with La Marck the king's notes of France 
amounting to 1,000,000 francs, which should 
be delivered to Mirabeau at the close *of the 
Assembly, if, in the meantime, the king should 
be satisfied in relation to Mirabeau's fidelity. 
In addition to these gifts, it was afterwards 
agreed to allow three hundred francs a month 
to the copyist of Mirabeau, " to pay for his si- 
lence," as La Marck said. Mirabeau accepted 
these gifts gratefully, including the conditional 
promise as to the additional million francs 
which were to be given on Caesar's method : 
something down, and much more to follow. 
La Marck was repeatedly charged to keep the 
whole transaction in the profoundest secrecy. 
Secrecy and silence are the well-known covers 
to venality everywhere. 

Mirabeau's private agreement to enter into 
the service of the king was consummated about 
the tenth of May, 1790. Previous to that time, 
every door to a place in the ministry had been 
closed against him. " If I were asked," says 
Professor Von Hoist, "what chapter of his whole 
history redounds, upon the whole, the most to 
his honor, not only as a statesman but also as 
a man, I should unhesitatingly answer : that of 
his relations to the court." I am far from 
thinking that this is, or ever will be, the judg- 
ment of history. It was not even the judgment

[Jan. l r 



of Mirabeau. On the twenty-first of October, 
1789, when he might have reasonably consid- 
ered that a place in the ministry was open to 
him, he wrote to La Marck : " A great succour 
I cannot accept without a place which makes 
it legitimate." A pension for public service 
previously rendered is a badge of honor ; a pay- 
ment secretly bestowed for political services to 
be rendered, " without a place which renders it 
legitimate," was then, and is now, considered a 
badge of dishonor. It is to the credit of hu- 
man nature that the prejudice, vices, and ven- 
alities of Mirabeau account for his failure to 
gain the confidence of his contemporaries. But 
these are not all of Mirabeau. His nobler part 
will live. His fifty notes to the king contain 
the most valuable contribution to political 
science that has come down to us from the Rev- 
olution. In that view, and with the proper 
qualifications, his relations to the court will re- 
dound most to his honor as a statesman and as 
a man. 

Professor Von Hoist seems to undervalue 
the great qualities of Lafayette. " Not many 
persons," he says, " who have cut a prominent 
figure in great times have lost so much by hav- 
ing the search-light of critical history turned 
upon them as Lafayette." The conduct and 
character of Lafayette were well known long 
before any such search-light was discovered. 
However it may be elsewhere, it was known, at 
least in France and in the United States, that 
in a long life tried by many tests, the conduct 
of Lafayette was exceptionally consistent, and 
that it was uniformly governed, not by passion, 
but by principle. In all emergencies he dis- 
played the same high qualities. He was early 
trained in the school of experience, under Wash- 
ington, whose friendship and confidence he al- 
ways retained. From the time when he first 
decided to come to America, if the testimony 
of La Marck may be accepted, his whole after- 
conduct was impelled by a force of will that 
one rarely meets. 

His first experience led him to prefer con- 
stitutional liberty under a republic. In the 
France of that time, he agreed with almost all 
of the Revolutionary leaders that it was suffi- 
cient to secure constitutional liberty under a 
king. He and the other leaders failed to ar- 
rest the course of the Revolution at a point 
where nearly all of them wished it to stop. It 
is easier to break down a dam than to stay the 
consequent rush of waters. In the last period 
of Mirabeau's life, a small but determined party 
of men began to prepare for the second and 



more destructive Revolution. It was to that 
party that Mirabeau, when interrupted, shouted : 
" Silence aux trente voix ! " Lafayette, with 
dauntless courage, long continued to resist the 
influence of that party. When it had acquired 
control of the king, the Assembly, the munici- 
palities, the clubs, and the armies, and resist- 
ance was no longer possible, Lafayette honor- 
ably withdrew from the army he commanded. 
" From the fifth of October," says our author, 
" Lafayette was the most powerful man in the 
realm, not to do good, but to avert, as well as 
to bring about, some of the worst evils. There- 
fore one of the main points in Mirabeau's pro- 
gramme from that day on is to coax or to force 
him into an offensive and defensive alliance, or 
to break his power." The alternative is not 
correctly stated. Mirabeau, for several months, 
labored incessantly both to secure an alliance 
with the most powerful man in France, and at 
the same time to break him down. Lafayette 
had daily access to the king. ' Mirabeau had 
not. Under his secret " employment," he could 
only send his notes to the king, giving advice 
which was never followed. In half of these 
secret notes he assailed Lafayette with unscru- 
pulous malice. He carried on both purposes at 
the same time one openly, the other secretly. 
On the first of June, 1790, Mirabeau wrote 
to Lafayette : " Your great qualities have need 
of my impelling force ; my impelling force has 
need of your great qualities." On the same 
day, he sent his first note to the king, in which, 
through page after page, he employed his " im- 
pelling force " in unscrupulous detraction of 
Lafayette's " great qualities." He failed to 
break Lafayette ; and he failed, as he had failed 
with others, and for the same reason, to secure 
the coveted alliance. Lafayette did not know- 
all that is now known about the conduct of 
Mirabeau. He knew, however, enough, and 
therefore justly refused to take the preferred 
hand, as afterwards the Girondins refused to 
take the hand of Dan ton. The one, offered 
treacherously, was soiled with money ; the other, 
offered magnanimously, was stained with blood. 
Professor Von Hoist revives the stale charge 
relating to Lafayette's conduct on the fifth 
and sixth of October, 1789. He says of La- 
fayette : " As to the part he played on the fifth 
of October, he himself has always seen a halo 
around his head." And again : " Though it 
cannot be directly proved that Lafayette rather 
liked to be led to Versailles, circumstantial evi- 
dence renders it likely." When Lafayette was 
hunting down the promoters of that movement, 



1895.]

it was Mirabeau who thought it necessary to 
explain to Lafayette that he [Mirabeau] had 
no part in it. When, afterwards, the charge 
was made against Lafayette, he gave a digni- 
fied explanation, refuting the slander. Who 
has a better claim to be favorably heard in ex- 
planation of his conduct, when assailed, than a 
man like Lafayette, who always stood erect, 
and who therefore can bear to have the search- 
light of history turned upon every part of his 
illustrious career ? Sainte-Beuve says : " All 
the reproaches against Lafayette in relation 
to the days of the twenty-second of July and 
the fifth and sixth of October seem to me to be 
abandoned or refuted." There never was a 
moment when Lafayette was not ready to risk 
his life, and, what was more to him than life, 
his deserved popularity, in the restraint of un- 
lawful violence ; nor when he failed in duty at 
the cost of principle. He was five years in the 
prisons of Austria. The doors of the dungeon 
at Olmutz were always open to him at any mo- 
ment when he should be ready to make the 
least denial of the political principles upon 
which his entire life was governed. In the 
treaty made after the victory over the Aus- 
trians at Campo-Formio, Napoleon inserted 
a stipulation securing to Lafayette his free- 
dom. In due time Lafayette returned to France. 
After thanking Napoleon for his liberty, he re- 
tired to his estates. He was offered many po- 
sitions under the government, and refused them 
all, saying to Napoleon : " The silence of my 
retreat is the maximum of my deference ; if 
Bonaparte wishes to serve liberty, I am devoted 
to him ; but I cannot approve of an arbitrary 
government, nor associate myself with it." He 
maintained the same attitude in subsequent con- 
versations with him. When some courtier said 
to Napoleon that Lafayette was talking against 
him, " Let that man alone," said Napoleon ; 
" he has said more to my face than he will ever 
say behind my back." 

It was no false idol that the fathers of our 
Republic set up in Lafayette ; and as long as 
pure character, consistent conduct, and noble 
sacrifice shall be admired, his memory, here, 

at least, will be honored. ^ T

A NEW BOOK ox SHAKESPEARE.* 



" Will it do to say anything more about 
Chaucer ? " The question was put some time 
since by the late Professor of Belles Lettres at 
Harvard. He thought (very fortunately for 
us) that it would do. Probably many people 
put the same question concerning Shakespeare, 
whenever they see a new book of Shakespear- 
ian criticism. And yet it is fortunate for us 
that Mr. Wendell thought it would do to say 
something more about Shakespeare. A good 
many books serve as bricks with which people 
succeed in building up a solid wall between 
themselves and the object of their study. This 
book on Shakespeare serves a very different 
purpose. 

Mr. Wendell has tried, to use his own words, 
" to see Shakspere, so far as possible at this 
distance of time, as he saw himself." In this 
there seems at first nothing very out of the way, 
nothing which would mark a book out from 
many other studies of Shakespeare. But, if 
you think of it, the task is not at all easy. Of 
course there is now at hand much whereby one 
may arrange the matter of historical perspect- 
ive, but in this case that is the least difficulty. 
The real difficulty is that people have got into 
the way of regarding Shakespeare as a phe- 
nomenon so out of the ordinary course of things 
that they never really think seriously of seeing 
him as he saw himself. Most people, and most 
critics too, feel about Shakespeare as did that 
noted man who had the plays bound like a fam- 
ily Bible and lettered " The Inspired Book." 
He had a special table for it in the reception- 
room, with a marble top, I believe. The no- 
tion is fatal to the best criticism. It has usually 
been the order of the day to feel that if there 
were anything in the plays that we did not ad- 
mire or understand, it was our own fat-witted- 
ness that blinded us. Many people will dislike 
to give up this idea : it had, to say the least, 
the charm of simplicity a paramount excel- 
lence with most folks when ideas are in ques- 
tion. Mr. Wendell, however, is very modern. 
He handles " The Merchant of Venice " with 
no more reverence than if it were First Chron- 
icles. " As an artist," he remarks of it, " of 
course, Shakspere's task was to distract at- 
tention from the absurdity of his plot." Such 
boldness startles one. But after the first shock 
is over, it is found to be refreshing. There 
might be danger of running into mere imperti-

[Jan. 1, 



nence. But Mr. Wendell probably found no 
especial need of guarding himself in this re- 
spect ; his book is modern, and scholarly too. 

To follow out his plan, Mr. Wendell keeps 
two ideas well in the mind of the reader. First, 
he never forgets that Shakespeare's plays were 
always produced for the pleasure of the au- 
dience of an Elizabethan theatre. That gives 
them an element which must be reckoned with, 
although it is circumstantial in character. Then, 
quite as important to realize, the man who suc- 
ceeded in pleasing the Elizabethans was a poet 
" of first-rate genius," a man who worked out 
his conceptions according to the different im- 
pulses of an emotional life and an artistic tem- 
perament. On these lines is the problem worked 
out ; and as a result we have a book which, 
while it is neither an exposition of the Shake- 
spearian theory on the conduct of life, nor a 
statement of the Shakespearian practice in 
blank verse, delineation of character, and devel- 
opment of plot, does give us a conception ( which 
we instinctively recognize as well founded) of 
the growth of the poet's genius. 

Such a book will of course be compared with 
the somewhat similar study of Mr. Dowden ; 
and it may at once be said that neither book 
loses by the comparison. Mr. Dowden's book 
was called " Shakspere : His Mind and Art," 
but (if one can for a moment make the separa- 
tion) it said most about the former subject. 
Mr. Wendell has more to say of the latter. In 
other words, while Mr. Dowden exhibits in a 
profoundly interesting way a development of 
thought and feeling, Mr. Wendell has succeeded 
rather better in showing the artistic character 
of that development. 

" That the development which we are trying to fol- 
low is rather artistic than personal, however, we cannot 
too strenuously keep in mind. The details of Shak- 
spere's private life, quite undiscoverable nowadays, are, 
after all, no one's business. For the rest, nobody fa- 
miliar with the literature and the stage of his time can 
very seriously believe that in writing his plays he gen- 
erally meant to be philosophical, ethical, didactic. Like 
any other playwright, he made plays for audiences. He 
differed from other playwrights chiefly in the fervid 
depth of his artistic nature." 

One need not go the whole length with Mr. 
Wendell and insist that the artistic side of the 
poet is the only one with which we have any 
concern. But it is undoubtedly a matter of 
absorbing interest. " Our business, after all," 
says Mr. Wendell, " is not to fathom the depths 
of Hamlet, but only to assure ourselves of Ham- 
let's relation to Shakspere's development as 
an artist." That makes very clear just what 



we may expect ; we may desire something be- 
sides, but we must acknowledge the immense 
value of this particular acquisition. Mr. Wen- 
dell leaves us in no doubt of his views upon 
certain possible additions. 

" The unanswerable question which that last sugges- 
tion raises, however, as to whether Beatrice and Cleo- 
patra be different portraits of the same living woman 
who inspired the Sonnets, is impertinent. The Shak- 
spere with whom we may legitimately deal is not the 
man, who has left no record of his actual life, but the 
artist, who has left the fullest record of his emotional 
experience. To search for the actual man is at once 
unbecoming and futile." 

It will probably occur to many that there is 
some middle ground between an aesthetic ap- 
preciation of Shakespeare's artistic nature and 
a prying curiosity into Shakespeare's personal 
affairs. To my mind, Mr. Dowden's book 
represents such a mean, for it seems to me to 
give us Shakespearian thought in a way, almost 
abstract, which is not exactly artistic nor per- 
sonal. 

But the subject of this book is Shakespeare 
as an artist. And, fortunately, Mr. Wendell 
has a very accurate power of appreciating the 
artistic nature. He has much that is very sug- 
gestive to say, in one place and another, as to 
what sort of man an artist is. " In an artist 
of whatever kind," he remarks, " a period of 
vigorous creative imagination declares itself 
after a fashion which people who are not of 
artistic temperament rarely understand." It is 
a pity, perhaps, but they do not. Mr. Wendell 
has a good deal to say which may be of help. 

It is unnecessary to try to convey in a few 
words the net result of such a book. Yet a 
single quotation will do something to show into 
what conception Mr. Wendell's method works 
itself out. 

" Quite apart from its lasting literary value, apart, 
too, from its unique personal quality, the work of Shak- 
spere has new interest to modern students as a complete 
individual example of how fine art emerges from an 
archaic convention, fuses imagination with growing sense 
of fact, and declines into a more mature convention where 
the sense of fact represses and finally stifles the force 
of creative imagination." 

There is a great deal more that one would 
like to say about the book. Its whole atmos- 
phere, its tone, is characteristic and agreeable ; 
its many bits of particular criticism are almost 
always put with a very nice touch. There may 
be a few whose ideas will be made no clearer 
by a comparison with the relations of Fanny 
Ellsler and the Due de Reichstadt, or even 
with the career of Louis Philippe's Due de 
Choiseul-Praslin. But these characters are, to

tell the truth, kept far in the background and 
rarely intrude upon us. There are many charm- 
ing obiter dicta not the least of which is the 
remark that Portia is " an exquisite type of 
that unhappily rare kind of human being who 
is produced only by the union of high thinking 
and high living." 

Mr. Wendell has produced an excellent and 
thoroughly modern book on Shakespeare. And 
when we say it is modern, we mean, not that it 
is new-fangled, nor that it is questionable, nor 
that it is flippant. We mean that it enables 
us to enjoy Shakespeare in a way that was im- 
possible to our grandfathers and grandmothers.

SOCIAL, PROGRESS IN ENGLAND.* 

The history of England is the history of 
European civilization, and in a sense the his- 
tory of humanity. Within the space of a thou- 
sand years her people have advanced from a 
condition of almost absolute barbarism to the 
front rank in culture and refinement. She has 
occupied this advanced position for several cen- 
turies. But in the thirteenth century England 
was far behind Spain, France, and the other con- 
tinental countries, in all those arts of life which 
go to make up a highly developed society. The 
bulk of her population still lived in mud huts, 
cultivated only small strips of land which were 
held under feudal tenure, knew little and cared 
less for the outside world, were scattered over 
a sparsely settled territory, and had little music, 
no art, and only the modicum of literature 
which was offered in church chronicles. To- 
day her people are better fed, better clothed, 
better housed, better educated, better governed, 
and enjoy more of the comforts of life, than 
those of any other European country. To un- 
derstand this progress, the causes underlying 
it and making it in a sense necessary, and the 
conditions rendering it possible, is to under- 
stand the law of social progress and gain the 
key to the history of the race. 

We are no longer in doubt as to what con- 
stitutes real progress. Recent investigations 
into the nature and laws of animal and plant 
life have given us a scientific basis for the com-

Literature, and Manners, from the Earliest Times to the Pres- 
ent Day. By Various Writers. Edited by H. D. Traill, D.C.L.,

parison of institutions and societies which is 
both exact and clear. Whatever be the cause, 
progress is the process by which the relatively 
complex grows out of the relatively simple or- 
ganization ; it consists of a series of changes 
in the structure, functions, and organs of the 
unit. Progress is the passing from simple, in- 
coherent, indefinite homogeneity, to complex, 
coherent, definite heterogeneity. At one end 
of the story stand the organisms having few 
parts, loosely held together, and but slightly 
related, while at the other are found bodies 
.having many intimately connected organs which 
depend entirely on each other for the full per- 
formance of their several functions. The char- 
acteristics of the process are a specialization of 
function, an integration and differentiation of 
parts, and a consequent complexity of struct- 
ure. It is the peculiar merit of the work that 
has been undertaken by Mr. Traill and his co- 
laborers that the ideal set before them is the 
scientific explanation of England's progress, 
and the critical examination of the relation be- 
tween cause and effect in the several depart- 
ments of social life. They have undertaken 
to write English history on Darwinian lines ; 
forgetting dynastic struggle, court intrigue, 
diplomacy, and war, they have given the nar- 
rative of the material, moral, and intellectual 
progress of the people, and of the career of the 
English people as a society, " not as a Polity, 
nor as a State among States." It deals with 
the manners and customs of the succeeding 
periods, with ways of thinking and feeling, with 
the art of getting a living. 

The work is almost encyclopaedic in character, 
but is in no way a compilation. It is more nearly 
a series of short excellent treatises by eminent 
specialists on the various phases of social life : 
on trade and agriculture, art and architecture, 
on language and literature, public health, mor- 
als, manners, the development of jurisprudence, 
the church, the army, the navy, science, edu- 
cation, religion, and the action and reaction 
between these different elements of our civili- 
zation. 

It is a stupendous task, and one which in- 
creases in difficulty as the story advances, and 
the accumulating facts grow too various in 
character to be massed together without risk 
of confusion. 

" New activities arise which refuse to class them- 
selves under the old headings. Divisions of the subject 
throw off subdivisions, which themselves require later 
on to be further subdivided. In every department of 
our national life there is the same story of evolutionary 
growth continuous in some of them, intermittent in

others, but unmistakable in all. Industries multiply 
and ramify; Commerce begets child after child; Art, 
however slowly in this country [England] as compared 
with others, diversifies its forms ; Learning breaks from 
its mediaeval tutelage and enters upon its world-wide 
patrimony; Literature, after achieving a poetic utterance 
the most noble to which man has ever attained, perfects 
a prose more powerful than that of any living compet- 
itor, and more flexible than all save one; and finally, 
Science, latest of birth, but most marvellous of growth, 
rises suddenly to towering stature, stretches forth its 
hundred hands of power, extending immeasurably the 
reach of human energies, and, through the reaction of 
a transformed external life upon man's inner nature, 
profoundly and irreversibly, if still to some extent ob- 
scurely, modifies the earthly destinies of the race." (P.. 
xvi.) 

What may be called the distribution of em- 
phasis thus becomes the greatest difficulty for 
the editor to overcome. It is therefore natural 
that just here the work should fall far short of 
the ideal. The various essays must inevitably 
differ widely in originality and in style, which 
is perhaps a happy incident of composite au- 
thorship. Some writers have assumed too much, 
while others have taken too little for granted, 
or have filled their pages with tedious quota- 
tions and long extracts from illustrative docu- 
ments instead of giving scientific conclusions 
based on a thorough study of the sources of 
historic information. Not infrequently a writer 
is guilty of speaking with that tone of authority 
which conveys the idea of absolute finality of 
judgment, while others leave their subject con- 
fessedly incomplete. All of these, however, are 
very minor defects when compared with the 
general result. 

Treating each department of social life in sev- 
eralty, it is true, has inevitably entailed a cer- 
tain amount of repetition ; but this need not have 
been allowed to be utterly superfluous, as is the 
reference to the " great discontent among the la- 
boring classes," on page 270 of Volume II., fol- 
lowing as it does an excellent account of this 
rebellion under Wat Tyler which is given by 
Mr. Corbett a few pages earlier. Still less was it 
necessary that the statement of fact by different 
writers in the same volume be contradictory, 
as are the references to the Black Death on 
pages 13 and 133 of the second volume. This 
is peculiarly unfortunate in view of the very 
contradictory opinions still held regarding even 
the general character of this fourteenth century 
and the importance of the Black Death as evi- 
dence of the preceding and as cause of the suc- 
ceeding condition of agriculture and of labor- 
ers. Was it in truth the golden age of the 
English laborer (Rogers), or a period of un- 
mitigated disaster, in which there were few 



years unmarked by famine and pestilence (Den- 
ton) ? The writer on Public Health, Mr. Creigh- 
ton, speaks with great vigor and acumen con- 
cerning the condition early in the century ; but 
unfortunately he is allowed, or has chosen to 
use, barely a page. 

It seems almost ungracious, however, thus to 
indicate possible faults and shortcomings, and 
apparently disparage a work of such marked 
excellence one which as a whole is so admir- 
ably well done, being conceived on the highest 
plan and executed with consummate skill. When 
completed, the work will include the results of 
the most advanced learning in English scientific 
circles regarding England's history. It will 
unquestionably be the best as well as the latest 
history, telling the whole story in the way best 
calculated to enforce the truth as to the causes 
of social progress and the real condition of ad- 
vancing civilization. The development of legal 
institutions and of jurisprudence is traced by 
the hand of a master ; the progressive expan- 
sion of industry and of commerce, the history 
of agriculture and its influence on the habits 
of the people, the action and reaction between 
the wants of the people and their economic 
movement, is sketched by economists who still 
utter the supply-and-demand shibboleth, but 
who nevertheless recognize the importance of 
" a living wage " and of the standard of liv- 
ing and social habits of the mass of the pop- 
ulation as affording the market which must in 
the long run determine the character of a coun- 
try's production ; the gradual spread of educa- 
tion from the few monks who alone knew how 
to write in Norman England, to the farthest 
corner of England and to the lowest level of 
English society, the advance in the arts and 
sciences, and the increase in enlightenment 
through university, grammar school, and vari- 
ous associations for the advancement of science, 
the growth of language and literature, each 
phase of the intellectual development is treated 
separately and with a view to show its connec- 
tion with and influence on " the progress of the 
people." Each chapter closes with an essay on 
manners and customs, which js apparently writ- 
ten by the editor, and seeks to give unity, con- 
tinuity, and logical completeness to the whole, 
and to show how industrial, intellectual, and 
religious forces register their influence in the 
social life of the people, in the dress, the 
amusements, the house and its decoration, meth- 
ods of eating and drinking, the literature and 
song, the every-day ways of living. 

The story begins with England before the

English when the earliest settler, the dark 
Ibernian, had been overcome by the tall and 
fair-hued Celt, and this Aryan tribesman, 
" With his pride of race and his more advanced concep- 
tion of property as a subject not of common but of fam- 
ily ownership, had declined to the condition of a despised 
villager, so far as social and political importance were 
concerned; the tribal chief had grown into the tribal 
king; the free land of the tribe, alike with the common 
land of the villagers, had become tributary to him ; and 
the two communities, family and communistic, were 
alike his subjects. It was through the strife of tribal 
kings, with its consequence of the flight, the exile, and 
the appeal for Roman assistance of those who had been 
worsted in the struggle, that the way was opened for 
the conquest of Britain to the conquerors of Gaul. . . . 
Dim with the dust of centuries, yet still distinctly vis- 
ible in dialect and tradition, in boundary lines of shire 
and diocese, and in the strange survivals of prehistoric 
feud, the tribal divisions of Celtic England can still be 
traced, while the rule of the Roman has been forgotten, 
even where his villa and his storied gravestone remain." 
(I., xxii.-xxiii.) 

In the second volume the progress of events 
is traced down through the Middle Ages and 
into the beginnings of modern England, when 
the Church had passed its climax of prosperity 
and independence. 

" Henceforth it prepares its own downfall by an even 
closer connection with the royal power. That royal 
power itself was beginning to show the influence of 
those theories and those events which were soon to 
cover all Europe with absolutist sovereignties. The new 
commercial classes, in whose support this absolutism 
was to find its practical basis, begin to manifest them- 
selves. Most rapid change of all, the feudal baronage 
had been, even in the preceding century, transforming 
itself into a modern nobility, intriguing for places and 
pensions, instead of taking up arms for local independ- 
ence." (II., 277-278.) 

The all-important lesson taught by these vol- 
umes is that development has been continuous 
and that there have been 110 violent breaks in 
the narrative, each succeeding social stage grow- 
ing naturally out of the preceding conditions 
through the action of forces of which it is pos- 
sible to measure the power for good and evil. 
Even the Norman Conquest is no cataclasm. 
The break is more apparent than real. It is 
true " the central administration and the local 
government, temporal and spiritual, had been 
taken over by a new set of men better man- 
agers, keener, more unscrupulous, less drunken 
and quarrelsome, better trained, hardier, thrift- 
ier, more in sympathy with the general Euro- 
pean movements, more adventurous, more tem- 
perate." But it is equally true that the " Nor- 
man conqueror built upon the main lines of that 
civil organization which he found in existence 
at his coming, and widely as the ' elevation ' of 
the completed structure may have departed 



from the prospective ideal of the Saxon archi- 
tect, the ground plan remains his." 

Equally in evidence is the fact that it is im- 
possible to give definite boundary to the Mid- 
dle Ages. Commercial growth brings consti- 
tutional changes, and constitutional changes in 
turn favor commercial growth ; but in neither 
is there a sharp line between medisevalism and 
modern life. The reign of Henry VII. is a 
period of transition ; it is marked by new ideas 
and new influences. 

" But they are only as yet in germ. The printing- 
press is at work; but its first result is destructive, almost 
paralysing to literature. America is found, both South 
and North ; but the effect on English industry and com- 
merce is hardly marked until Elizabeth's reign. The 
new learning had made its way to Oxford with Colet 
and Erasmus; but no breath of hostility can yet be de- 
tected against Church dogmas." 

There is no sudden change, nor is the course 
of development a chapter of happy accidents. 
Each advance on social organization has its dis- 
tinct cause or set of causes, and telling the story 
of human progress is as definitely a science as 
is recounting changes in the physical structure 
of the earth, the movements of the heavenly 
bodies, or the way chemical forces combine to 
produce very unlike substances out of the same 
elements. It is a science, moreover, whose laws 
cannot be broken with impunity. Humanity 
is slow in learning the lesson, but even a hasty 
reading of these pages should convince pessi- 
mistic reformers that no scheme of social pro- 
gress is worth a moment's consideration which 
implies a sudden and radical regeneration of 
human nature, or which involves artificial ap- 
pliances outside the steady development of the 
wants and desires of mankind. Change is the 
law of life ; but it is change that is slow and 
gradual, and which comes practically through 
the almost unconscious action of forces lying 
deeply buried in human nature.

EDWIX BOOTH'S BETTERS. * 

When, a little time ago, Mr. William Win- 
ter's biography of Edwin Booth came into hand 
and was read with a grateful sense of its ade- 
quacy by the admirers and friends of the great 
actor, it was supposed no superior memorial of 
that troubled genius would likely be added to 
our literature. A tender intimacy of many 
years' duration between the two distinctly gifted

men had qualified the critic to be the best proc- 
tor of the actor ; and the appreciative estimate 
of the professional achievements of the player 
was sweetened and enriched by a sympathetic 
knowledge of the man expressed in a tribute 
honorable alike to the memory of the dead and 
to the reputation of the living friend. 

But filial affection guiding the intelligence 
of an accomplished woman has done even more 
for the public's gratitude in withdrawing, gently, 
tenderly, and with touching simplicity, the veil 
of privacy that guarded the domestic and per- 
sonal life of Edwin Booth, for the first time 
permitting his countrymen to view this chief 
glory of the American stage in the light of a 
character so fine and a nature so earnest, un- 
selfish, and devout, that admiration of the 
genius must hereafter be associated with loving 
regard of the man, so famous and yet so little 
known for what he was in heart and soul. 

Mrs. Grossman's unaffectedly, almost art- 
lessly, written recollections of her father com- 
pose one of the most exquisitely beautiful and 
graciously impressive pictures of character to 
be found in literature ; and though there is but 
a detail here and there, though the few pages 
are mainly generalizations covering memories 
from the infancy to the mature womanhood of 
the writer, these, with the letters penned with 
no expectation that they would ever find their 
way to the printing press, must be accepted as 
a better and truer portraiture of the man than 
may be found in the most voluminous biograph- 
ical narrative. One yields so completely to 
the charm of Mrs. Grossman's candor of love 
and pride as to enter feelingly into the spirit 
and sentiment of her own mind, moved by her 
emotions, animated by her spirit of affection, 
until, reading here and there among the letters, 
one feels how precious a thing it was to be near 
to the heart and close in the life of such a man. 
It is a new understanding of Booth, an under- 
standing that gives new dignity and worth, and 
brings the reader nearer in sentiment to the 
actor whose work we have viewed in silent awe 
or approved in tumultuous applause, little think- 
ing how much of mildness, diffidence, sweetness 
and sadness of spirit lay below the noble forces 
expended in the creation of characters that 
ranged from the boisterous mirth of Petruchio 
to the sublime madness of Lear, and had in 
them all the passions of nature. We have 
known him in the craft, cunning, and knavery 
of lago ; in the woful melancholy and sombre 
philosophy of Hamlet ; in the frank, open but 
subtly abused honesty and generosity of Othello; 



in the ambition-corrupted nobility of Macbeth ; 
in the piteous bitterness of the laughing, rail- 
ing, mordant Bertruchio ; in the masterly 
counterpart of the age-broken and ingratitude- 
maddened Lear ; in the jocundity of gay and 
sportive roles ; we perhaps have known him in 
the easy moments when permitted friends have 
shared the pleasures of free and bantering, 
jest-enlivened conversation, with no more se- 
roius care than to keep cigars alight ; but here 
from his daughter's pen is a picture of him as 
few, indeed, have known him : 

" His nature was childlike, trustful, dependent, yet 
he was always my wise and loving counselor. How 
often would he quote the following adage to me : 
' If your lips you'd keep from slips, 

Of these five things beware : 
Of whom you speak, 
To whom you speak, 

And how, and when, and where.' 

He was essentially paternal and purely domestic; and 
these qualities were never tarnished by public favor or 
worldly praise. In the home he was at his best among his 
favorite pipes and books, and surrounded by his Lares and 
Penates. He loved personally to arrange the furnishings 
of his home, and carefully studied its merest details. He 
had a woman's taste, and his artistic touch was every- 
where evident. His delight in adorning the home never 
led him into extravagant display, for his tastes were al- 
ways simple, and he had no love for ostentation. . . . 
With boyish enthusiasm he enjoyed every detail of farm 
life, and loved nothing better than to watch the growth 
of the trees he himself had planted. His love of ani- 
mals amounted, at one time, almost to a passion. . . . 
His loyalty to his friends, his reverence and considera- 
tion for the old, no matter in what station of life, and his 
manifold charities to the poor and needy, were not the 
least among his many virtues. His modesty in bestow- 
ing favors extended itself even to the members of his 
family, and his beautiful gifts to me were offered with 
a tender, shy reserve. . . . His unselfish devotion to his 
mother and invalid sister were [sic] conspicuous among 
his domestic traits. He was a loyal and devoted husband, 
and on many occasions, after the play, I have seen him 
tenderly nurse his invalid wife (to whom he was mar- 
ried in 1869), thus losing his much-needed rest. When 
scandalous tongues attacked the privacy of his home, 
he refused to contradict the false reports circulated, and 
invariably replied to my earnest protestations, 'My 
daughter, all will yet be well.' His dignity toward his 
detractors won for him a host of defenders. My inti- 
mate knowledge of his heroic sacrifices, his early strug- 
gles and privations, his crushing sorrow and bitter dis- 
appointments, had made my father a hero in my eyes, 
and I admire his noble manhood even more ardently 
than I cherish his genius. . . . His veneration for all 
religious subjects, his belief in the immortal life, his 
practical uses of the teachings of Jesus, and his convic- 
tion that God's will is best, never forsook him even in 
the midst of his severest trials; and though often the 
victim of the basest deception from so-called friends, 
who, in not a few instances cruelly imposed upon his 
trustful, generous nature, he remained almost childlike 
in his belief in the integrity of others. ... I can- 
not speak without tears of the declining weeks of his 
beautiful life of his gentle patience during his last ill-

ness (of seven weeks' duration), and of the childlike 
beauty of his countenance when all furrows of care and 
sorrow were smoothed away, and ' nothing could touch 
him further.' His last coherent words were addressed 
to our little children, whom we had taken to his bedside 
two days before he died. My boy called gently, ' How 
are you, dear grandpa ? ' and the answer came loud and 
clear, in the familiar boyish way, ' How are you your- 
self, old fellow ? ' " 

Exquisitely beautiful as is this picture of 
manly nobility and spiritual sweetness of char- 
acter, it is not merely the partial and affection- 
colored view of an only and tenderly, fondly 
cherished daughter. There is in the goodly num- 
ber of letters, written to mirthful impulse, 
or with serious emotion, or in strangely mel- 
ancholy but never wholly despondent vein, 
through a period of thirty years, scarcely one 
that does not in its measure confirm, in its sen- 
timent, in its candor, in its ingenuous sincere 
tone, the truth of this ideal. But the picture 
would be incomplete without some associated 
touches from the life of the woman, love of whom 
gave lofty purpose to the soul of Booth, grief 
for whose untimely sudden death very nearly 
betrayed to irredeemable desolation the genius 
that is so lustrous a part of America's pride of 
intellectual, artistic achievement. Mary Dev- 
lin was the object of Booth's first impassioned, 
romantic, exalted love, a love that was only 
"this side idolatry." That she merited the ador- 
ation he gave to her is not to be questioned. 
Though she was no more than a girl when they 
were married, the dignity of her character, the 
generous quality of her nature, and the high di- 
rection of her exceptionally clear, pure, and 
lofty mind, fitted her perfectly to be the com- 
panion, comforter, guide, and sustaining in- 
spiration of a man whom the very nature of his 
genius made dependent upon some finer stim- 
ulus than his own too easily discouraged ambi- 
tion. What her influence upon him was, what 
herself must have been to him in the three 
swiftly speeding years of their blissful but earn- 
est union, this excerpt from one of her letters to 
him will sufficiently declare. It was written 
just before they were married, and is at once a 
hope for herself and a promise to him, both of 
which were happily fulfilled of time : 

" This morning in my walk, I was thinking of the be- 
ing God had given me to influence and cherish, for you 
have ever seemed to me like what Shelley says of him- 
self ' a phantom among men ' ' compauionless as the 
last fading storm,' and yet my spirit ever seems lighter 
and more joyous when with you. This I can account 
for only by believing that a mission has been given me 
to fulfil, and that I shall be rewarded by seeing you 
rise to be great and happy. 

" Ah ! the angels surely will rejoice in heaven when 



that is achieved. Edwin, I have never told you yet, 
have I, of all the odd thoughts I have had, and do have, 
about you ? Well, on some of the days to come, when 
I am influenced by your loved presence, and after the 
singing of some pretty song, perhaps I will tell you." 

Among all the letters written by Edwin 
Booth, none sets the man before us so clearly, 
so humanly, so compassionately, and yet so ad- 
mirably and lovably, as that of March 3, 1863, 
addressed to his friend, Captain Adam Badeau, 
beginning thus : 

" By the time this reaches you, you will perhaps have 
heard of the terrible blow I have received a blow 
which renders life aimless, hopeless, darker than it was 
before I caught the glimpse of heaven in true devotion 
to her, the sweetest being that made man's home a 
something to be loved. My heart is crushed, dryed up 
and desolate. I have no ambition now, no one to please, 
no one to cheer me. . . . You can feel my agony I 
know, and if while I was happy I failed to keep you 
advised of my whereabouts and doings, you see I think 
of you in my misery, and seek to pour out my flood of 
grief where I know it will not be despised. I should not 
complain even in my gulf of woe, for surely God is just, 
is good, is wiser than we, and nothing has ever so im- 
pressed me with the truth of this as Mollie's death. . . . 
They tell me that time and use will soften the blow, and 
I shall grow to forget her. God forbid ! My grief, keen 
as it is and crushing, is still sweet to me; for it is a part 
of her. . . . What can I do or look upon that will not 
remind me of her ? All things I loved or admired she 
took delight in; my acting was studied to please her, 
and after I left the theatre, and we were alone, her ad- 
vice was all I asked, all I valued. If she was pleased I 
was satisfied; if not, I felt a spur to prick me on to at- 
tain the point. . . . Doesn't it seem hard that one so 
young, so full of life, devotion, and promise should go 
so suddenly ? Would to God I were there with her. 
But I suppose that's wrong; I suppose I will be there 
shortly. . . . Madness would be a relief to me, and I 
have often thought that I stood very near to the brink 
of it. ... God bless you, Ad ! Be brave and struggle, 
but set not your heart on anything in this world. If 
good comes to you take it and enjoy it; but be ready al- 
ways to relinquish it without a groan." 

It is only during the period of his immoder- 
ate grief, the influence of which was never 
wholly cast off, that the letters are in gloomy,

was by nature in the mood of Edwin Booth, one 
is surprised, indeed, by the frequency with which 
humor, drollery, and a boyishness of capering 
fancy, got into his letters. He had a keen sense 
of the ludicrous, and comical conceits crop up 
continuously, while the jaunty air with which 
he disposes of all sorts of friendly and even 
business interests informs one how charming, 
how delightful a companion he must have been 
in some snugly comfortable corner, with close, 
familiar friends about him, his cheerful pipe 
sending coils of gray and azure smoke to 
wreathe themselves lazily into quaint and del- 
icate fancies above his head. Averse to society,

he loved his friends, and from the first of these 
letters written to his prattling baby girl in 
the style so well known of fond parents address- 
ing their tempered wisdom to infant minds 
to the last, written to the Shakespearian scholar, 
Mr. Horace Furness, whether the mood be grave

through, a temper wonderfully level with the

Professor Hoffmann's book on " The Sphere of

with the distinction between the State and its gov- 
ernment, and then, on that as a basis, proceeds to 
construct a body of political science. The constant 
application of the principles laid down by him to

present-day problems is a noticeable feature of the 
work. Education, property, corporations, transpor- 
tation, taxation, money, criminals, pauperism, cities, 
the family, the church, international relations, 
these are the themes of successive chapters. The 
fundamental thesis of Professor Hoffman's political 
science is the absolute and indivisible sovereignty of 
the State. This is essentially the view taken by 
Burgess and others. It is undoubtedly correct, if 
by sovereignty one means sovereignty within the 
sphere of human law. But the last word has not 
yet been said on this vital topic. The broad and 
vigorous view which the author takes of current 
questions is interesting. He holds that the earth 
belongs to civilization, and that the organized State 
may very properly do for the welfare of its mem- 
bers many things besides police duty. This is very 
far from the once dominant doctrine of laissez faire 
a doctrine which meant in substance simply "every 
man for himself and the devil take the hindmost." 
The modern State is not organized socialism, but it 
is in fact highly socialistic. Perhaps it might bet- 
ter be called " the cooperative State," in contradis- 
tinction from the other form. And it is this kind 
of State which operates the common means of com- 
munication, which may operate means of transporta- 
tion, which provides education, cares for the poor 
and the insane, and in many other ways works for 
the general welfare. It is this kind of State, too,, 
which may logically join with others in the interest 
of humanity to compel a semi-barbarous State to de- 
cent government. Common humanity should, for 
example, lead the civilized world to put an end, 
once for all, to the hideous farce known as the gov- 
ernment of Turkey. A government which cannot 
or will not prevent such horrors as the Bulgarian 
outrages in 1876 and the Armenian horrors of 1894 
is clearly unfit to exist. In short, the cooperative 
State and cooperative States are the means which 
men are using to make life better worth living. They 
are not open to the reproach of paternalism. That 
was a phase of the personal autocracies which have 
now all but disappeared from the world. Coopera- 
tive democracies have taken their place. And it is 
this modern form of State which Mr. Hoffman pre- 
sents so cleverly. 

Mr. Charles Borgeaud, in his little study of " The 
Rise of Modern Democracy," tries to trace the ori- 
gin of that democratic movement which now dom- 
inates political society. He finds its germ in the 
Protestant Reformation, its early buds in the En- 
glish Puritan uprising of the seventeenth century. 
Mr. Borgeaud shows very clearly that the Re- 
formation in both its phases was essentially demo- 
cratic. This was not clearly seen by many of the 
leaders. Luther and Calvin were not democrats, 
either in religion or politics. The English eccle- 
siastical revolution under Henry and Edward and 
Elizabeth was very conservative, and was not in- 
tended by its promotors to pass beyond an effective 
control. It was only under John Knox in Scotland, 
and under the extreme Puritans who fought the 



1895.]

Stuart kings, that a real democracy was apparent. 
In truth, the popes and the kings who assailed Pro- 
testantism on the continent, as aimed at the very 
thrones of pontiff and monarch, were more far-see- 
ing than the reformers themselves. And when James 
I. flouted the Puritan petitioners at Hampton Court, 
he realized acutely, as did few others, the extreme 
danger to his royal prerogative coming from these 
simple-minded and pious people. The logical mean- 
ing of the right of private judgment, on which were 
founded the religious revolutions of the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries, was certainly the sov- 
ereignty of the people over the State as well as over 
the Church. The American Constitution and the 
French Revolution are in a very true sense direct 
sequents of Luther's ninety-five theses at Wittenberg. 
Part of this, Mr. Borgeaud makes quite plain. He 
points out how democratic were the parliamentary 
army of Cromwell, and the Puritan settlers in Mass- 
achusetts and Connecticut and Rhode Island. And 
the settlement of those colonies was a part of the 
same movement as that which cost Charles I. his 
head. An apt illustration of these premature efforts 
at democratic reform in the State is the " Agree- 
ment of the People," which was proposed by a large 
body of the army, in 1647, as a settlement of the 
difficulties. The king was a captive, but was still 
king, the house of lords was yet a part of parlia- 
ment, and it seemed far from certain that the fruits 
of the wars would not be lost. The " Agreement " 
was in fact a sketch of a republican constitution for 
England. It contained such features as the adop- 
tion of a written constitution which should include 
a bill of rights and definite limitations on the pow- 
ers of parliament, abolition of king and lords, equal 
electoral districts, universal suffrage, and biennial 
parliaments. All this was in advance of the age. 
It took England forty years to reach the bill of 
rights, a half century to adopt triennial parliaments 
(soon changed at that), two centuries to compass 
electoral reforms, and king and lords are yet part of 
parliament. But the great features of the " Agree- 
ment" were in fact put into operation in the dem- 
ocratic American colonies, and finally embodied in 
the Constitution of the United States. So it is 
quite correct to say that the meeting of Cromwell's 
regiments in 1647, which voted the " Agreement," 
was really a preliminary caucus of which the Con- 
vention over which Washington presided in 1787 
did the finished work. And England is slowly com- 
ing to the methods of American democracy. Mr. 
Borgeaud is substantially right. Political democ- 
racy is a direct result of the overthrow of ecclesi- 
astical aristocracy. 

Dr. Ellis Stevens's work on the " Success of the 
Constitution of the United States " is devoted to the 
thesis of the English origin of the American Con- 
stitution. His task is not difficult to accomplish. 
The convention at Philadelphia did not evolve a 
frame of government from their own inner con- 
sciousness. They were a group of lawyers, judges, 
and statesmen, who knew quite clearly the defects 



of the Confederation, and used the material at hand 
in mending them. This material was the experi- 
ence of the several States, both as English colonies 
and as members of the Union, and the English sys- 
tem of government and law. With all these things 
the convention were quite familiar. They knew 
that the quarrel of the colonists with King George 
had been over what they deemed the essential rights 
of Englishmen. They were hardly likely to abandon 
these rights, or the accustomed means of guarding 
them, in the final structure of national government 
which was the outcome of the Revolution. And so 
it is not difficult to trace to an English origin, either 
directly or through the colonies, almost every clause 
of the Constitution. Incidentally, Mr. Stevens de- 
votes considerable space to exhibiting the weakness 
of the claims of Mr. Douglas Campbell in behalf 
of Dutch influence. Here again the author's task 
is not difficult. Mr. Campbell's book is rather in- 
teresting than conclusive. That there was some 
result on American institutions by contact with 
the Dutch is quite possible. But just how much, 
and just what that result was, it would not be easy 
to estimate. The most striking part of Mr. Stev- 
ens's book is that devoted to the Executive. Mr. 
Stevens brings out very clearly the really great 
power of the American President, and its quite di- 
rect derivation from the old form of English king- 
ship, as well as from the temporary revival of that 
form by George III. An extended footnote details 
an interview of the author with the late ex-Presi- 
dent Hayes, which gives an interesting view of 
American cabinet methods and of the very great ex- 
tent of executive powers, even as bearing on the ini- 
tiation and progress of legislation. The banking and 
currency measure now pending is a significant illus- 
tration. There is no doubt that Mr. Cleveland is in 
many ways a greater potentate than Queen Victoria. 
We are a composite nation, to be sure. But our 
political organization and legal methods, like our 
national language, are undoubtedly English. The 
types have been rather unkind to Mr. Stevens in a 
few instances. " Cobbit " for " Cobbett" on p. 144, 
"1737" for "1787 " on p. 146, and " Petition of 
Rights " for " Petition of Right" on p. 207, are 
cases in point. Otherwise the volume is a good ex- 
ample of bookmaking. 

Among the modern devices for putting the ma- 
terials of history within reach of scholars in general, 
that of making reprints of important documents is 
most valuable. Stubbs's " Select Charters " is price- 
less to students of Old and Middle English institu- 
tions. Mr. S. R. Gardiner's Selection of Docu- 
ments of the Puritan Revolution is also exceedingly 
useful. And now Mr. G. W. Prothero has filled the 
gap between them by a series of reprints from the 
reigns of Elizabeth and James I. The Act of Su- 
premacy, for instance, is printed in full. Other 
documents are abbreviated more or less. Besides 
statutes, there are well-chosen extracts from the pro- 
ceedings of parliament, including the famous speech 
of Peter Wentworth, for which that worthy wa

committed to the Tower ; there are executive docu- 
ments illustrative of constitutional tendencies of the 
times, taken from Strype, Camden, et al.; there are 
not a few famous law cases reprinted Bates's, 
and the impeachment of Lord Bacon ; and there is 
a mass of ecclesiastical documents. The selections 
are made with discretion, and are carefully indexed. 
The book well illustrates the modern method of his- 
torical study. At one time, not so long ago, his- 
tory was merely a branch of literature. It was read 
largely as a portion of " polite letters," the main 
thing being literary style. To-day history is a branch 
of science. Literary finish is a desirable quality, 
but no more so than in a work on glaciers. The 
main thing is sound thought. And now no student 
is content to " read " history. He investigates. He 
wants the material from which a correct view of 
facts and their relations can be had. And he wants 
to work out this view for himself. In short, the 
modern student of history is quite like the intelli- 
gent reader of newspapers, who cares little for edi- 
torials, but wants all the news accurately reprinted. 
He can make his own comments. Mr. Prothero's 
book gives a photographic reproduction of history 
in the making of a most important epoch in the 
development of the English people. With Stubbs, 
Prothero, and Gardiner, one can study the England 
of Elizabeth and her pedantic Scotch cousin with 
some satisfaction. 

" Common Sense Applied to Woman Suffrage " 
is the title of a breezy little volume by Dr. Mary 
Putnam-Jacobi. The author is learned and lucid 
and trenchant. But beyond all, she is unconsciously 
and deliciously convincing of the essential likeness 
of men and women. Men are quite apt to write 
one-sidedly. We call this partisanship. If we think 
with the writer, we like it. If we think otherwise, 
we rail at it. If we try to be even-minded, we won- 
der why a book should not be a scholar's investiga- 
tion rather than an advocate's plea. But then we 
know better. Books are written for all manner of 
reasons, sometimes for no discoverable reason at 
all. And this book is quite as partisan as a polit- 
ical editorial written by a mere man. That Woman 
Suffrage is coming there can be little doubt. In- 
deed, it is already here in some form. But whether 
we are ready to go on opening the ballot unreservedly 
to indiscriminate classes, is not so sure. Because 
an illiterate and fat-witted man may vote, is hardly 
a sound reason for granting that privilege to the 
same grade of woman. After the war we armed 
the freedmen with the ballot, for their self-defence. 
The outcome is hardly an irrefragable argument for 
unlimited suffrage. But if the ignorant sea-island 
negro may vote, why should the alert modern col- 
lege woman be unenfranchised ? Why, indeed ? Still, 
why should we enfranchise the ignorant sea-island 
negro woman ? This is the case in a nutshell. And 
would not the champions of a sexless vote be more 
helpful towards the political regeneration of which 
they dream, if at the same time they worked towards 
an intelligent and a responsible vote? 



Mr. D. S. Remsen, of the New York bar, devotes 
his little book on " Primary Elections " to a discus- 
sion of party organization and its improvement. 
His idea is to guard primary elections by an elab- 
orate system of provisions, substantially equivalent 
to an Australian ballot law with minority represen- 
tation. The main objection to his scheme is its 
complexity. Our whole body of democratic insti- 
tutions is tending to become a mechanism so vast and 
complicated that it may in the end require a tech- 
nical education to take any share in it. It is said 
that the President of the late New York State Con- 
stitutional Convention was unable to mark his vote 
properly at the recent election. We are trying to 
remedy the evils of universal suffrage by ingenious 
self-acting devices. Perhaps we may learn in time 
some simple method which will do quite as well. 
Meanwhile, let us be rather slow in adding more 
cogs and wheels. 

Mr. James Douglas discusses " Canadian Inde- 
pendence, Imperial Federation, and Annexation," 
from a Canadian point of view. He argues that 
neither Canada nor the United States would have 
much to gain from a political union, while each 
would have not a little to lose. Mr. Douglas is 
probably right. The idea of uniting in one great 
republic all America north of Mexico is one that 
tickles the fancy. But there are elements in the 
problem which cannot be disregarded, and which at 
least admonish to make haste slowly. Certainly the 
status of the French in Canada is unlike anything 
with which we have to deal, and one which would 
be peculiarly annoying in our system. It is bad 
enough for us to be asked to make a state out of 
the Spanish peons in New Mexico. But the State 
of Quebec would hold such views of the relations of 
Church and State as would hardly accord with Amer- 
ican ideas. We don't need Canada just now.

Memorials of 
St. James's 
Palace. 



The distinctive merits of first-rate 
English book-making are well exem- 
plified in two soberly elegant octavo 
volumes from the press of Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co., entitled " Memorials of St. James's Palace." 
The author, the Rev. Edgar Sheppard, Sub-Dean of 
the Chapels Royal, has spent several laborious years 
in the compilation of his work, pursuing his re- 
searches among the records of more or less remote 
royalty with a pious enthusiasm and a reverential 
sense of the semi-sacredness of his theme not very 
intelligible to the American mind, perhaps, but 
nevertheless interesting and instructive in its pres- 
ent results. Strange to say, in this age of never 
ending, ever multiplying books, the story of the 
whilom home of England's kings and queens, and 
the constituted centre of her court pageant and cere- 
monial, has never before been told in continuous

detail. Yet from time immemorial the Palace of St. 
James's has been the cynosure of loyal British eyes, 
and its name has long been a potent one to conjure 
with in continental diplomatic circles. Scarcely a 
chamber, hall, or corridor in the venerable pile but 
has its curious and interesting personal or historical 
association. It contains, for instance, the room, of 
sombre memory to all leal Jacobitical souls, where 
Charles I. slept away his last allotted hours beside 
the faithful Herbert, and whence he passed, on that 
fatal frosty morning, ominous in the annals of mon- 
archy, to the scaffold at Whitehall. But St. James's 
record (unlike that of grim Holyrood) is joyous 
rather than tragic mainly the chronicle of royal 
births, baptisms, and marriages, of shining court 
fetes and formalities, the whole pleasantly seasoned 
with a thousand and one odds and ends of piquant 
Walpolian chat and personalia. Into these and more 
important matters our author has gone exhaustively 
and enthusiastically, leaving no documentary stone 
unturned, and tracing the story of the Palace and 
its associations and regulations from the founding 
(before A.D. 1100) of its predecessor, a lepers' hos- 
pital (''spittle for mayden lepers," old Howel calls 
it) dedicated to St. James the Less, down to mod- 
ern times. Pictorially, the work is a notable one. 
There are eight full-page copper plates, mostly por- 
traits, besides a great number of full-page and text 
illustrations. Many of these are from rare originals 
in the Royal collections, and all are well chosen and 
germane to the text. 



More of the 
writings of 
Jefferson, 



The fourth volume of Mr. Paul Lei- 
cester Ford's collection of the Writ- 
ings of Thomas Jefferson (Putnam) 
covers the period from 1784 to 1787. Mr. Jeffer- 
son as the representative in Paris of the new Re- 
public is an interesting figure. He was in a society 
thoroughly congenial to him, which he thought the 
most spirited, the most cultivated, and the most en- 
tertaining in the world. He had a penchant for spec- 
ulation, and Paris was the favorite resort of philos- 
ophers who had learned to respect and love one 
great American, Franklin, and who were delighted 
to add another American to their circle. If Jeffer- 
son lacked the originality, profundity, and wit of 
Franklin, his suggestiveness and enthusiasm suited 
the French temperament of the day, and kept alive 
the popular interest in the experiment in govern- 
ment across the Atlantic. Jefferson's letters, whether 
written to ladies, men of letters, or statesmen, have 
a grace and charm suited to any age. He never 
lost an opportunity to extend the information about 
his own country, and to commend the virtues and 
happiness of his fellow countrymen as worthy of 
imitation. He was industrious in acquiring infor- 
mation as to new inventions and improvements in 
agriculture, which he communicated to his corre- 
spondents in the new world. Thus, we find him 
writing to Edward Rutledge, Paris, July 14, 1787 : 
" I was glad to find that the adoption of your rice 
to this market was considered worth attention, as I 



had supposed it. I set out from hence impressed 
with the idea the rice dealers here had given me, that 
the difference between your rice and that of Pied- 
mont proceeded from a difference in the machine 
for cleaning it. At Marseilles I hoped to know 
what the Piedmont machine was; but I could find 
nobody who knew anything of it. I determined 
therefore to sift the matter to the bottom by cross- 
ing the Alps into the rice country. I found the ma- 
chine exactly such a one as you had described to 
me in Congress in the year 1775. There was but 
one conclusion to be drawn, to-wit, that the rice was 
of a different species, and I determined to take 
enough to put you in seed." This helpfulness was 
the best service Jefferson could render his country- 
men at that time, and it shows the benevolent side 
of his character. 

English-German About a y ear a g Professor Victor 

Comparative Henry of the University of Paris 

Grammar. published his " Precis de Grammaire 

Compare'e de 1'Anglais et de PAllemand," and re- 
cently his own translation has appeared under the 
title " Comparative Grammar of English and Ger- 
man" (Macmillan). The book, as the preface 
points out, is intended to introduce^ the comparative 
method to students having some knowledge of both 
languages, though for the English reader it will be 
intelligible after he has mastered the general out- 
lines of the grammatical structure of German. The 
author does not presuppose a knowledge of either 
Sanskrit or Greek, but deals with the subject simply 
from the Germanic side. The book includes a list 
of about forty of the most essential works on Ger- 
manic philology, and a short introduction on the 
classification and relation of the Germanic languages 
and dialects. The body of the work is divided into 
four parts, treating respectively Sounds, Words, 
Declension, and Conjugation. In the first division 
a brief survey of the elements of physiological pho- 
netics is followed by a study in which the vowels 
are traced back, by the inductive method, to their 
common prehistoric form. In a similar manner the 
laws of consonantal change are discussed. The 
treatment, though brief, is clear, and affords the 
beginner a presentation of the subject that is easily 
comprehended. The accepted results of recent Ger- 
man investigation are stated in such a way that the 
English-speaking student will find it advantageous 
to read what Professor Henry has to say on the 
subject of Phonetics before taking up a work like 
Sievers's Grundztige. The chapter, or rather section, 
on Words deals with the subject of derivation, and 
affords a systematic discussion of a subject upon 
which courses of lectures are frequently given at 
German universities, but upon which the literature 
that is useful to the beginner is meagre. Independ- 
ent of its scientific value, it affords the student an 
opportunity to enlarge and strengthen his German 
vocabulary ; for it exhibits clearly, and in a manner 
easily remembered, some of the most important 
points of agreement and difference between English

and German words. The two following sections deal 
with the inflections, and show the essentially Ger- 
manic structure of the English. The book concludes 
with an excellent index of English and of German 
words, the former containing some nine hundred 
entries and the latter a rather larger number. Va- 
rious errors in the French edition have been cor- 
rected. The work is satisfactorily printed, and the 
English is surprisingly idiomatic and accurate. All 
things considered, the work is an able and valuable 
one, and is unrivalled in English. 

The fourth volume of the " Journal 
Snake Dance o f American Ethnology and Archae- 

of the Indians. \ 

ology (Houghton) continues the re- 
cords of the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological 
Expedition, and is a worthy successor to the previous 
volumes. It is dedicated "to the memory of Mrs. 
Mary Hemenway": a reminder of the loss to the 
world of a noble-hearted woman, liberal in her in- 
terested helpfulness of scientific work in America. 
Dr. Fewkes is the author of the volume, in the pre- 
paration of which he was assisted by Mr. Owens and 
Mr. Stephen. The chief author, deeply interested 
as he is in the comparative study of American In- 
dian Ceremonials, must have felt a special satisfac- 
tion in preparing this description of the famous 
Snake Dance of the Mokis. The ceremony, which 
is celebrated but once in two years at any one pue- 
blo, was observed by Dr. Fewkes at Walpi in 1891 
and 1893. The account given relates chiefly to the 
observance of 1891, but is pieced out here and there 
with the later notes. A careful description of each 
stage of the nine days' ceremony is presented ; uten- 
-sils, dress, gestures, songs, are minutely detailed ; 
illustrations help to clearness of understanding. No 
attempt is made to explain the significance of the 
ceremony, but the myth dramatized at one part of 
the performance is presented. This snake dance, in 
which living rattlesnakes are carried writhing in the 
mouths of the performers, has been for years a favor- 
ite subject with newspaper writers. But although 
some good material notably Captain Bourke's 
book has been published, students will hail this 
carefully detailed account as perhaps the most valu- 
able contribution to the subject yet made. 



The living 
composers 
of Germany, 



The excellent series of " Masters of 
Contemporary Music " (imported by 
Scribner) has a new volume devoted 
to the living composers of Germany, written by Mr. 
J. A. Fuller Maitland. A volume dealing with such 
names as Brahms, Bruch, Goldmark, Joachim, and 
Clara Schumann, has a field of great interest, even 
though it be true, as the author thinks, that " the 
tide of music which for so many years has favored 
Germany above all other nations seems almost at 
the ebb, at last." The enormous influence of Wag- 
ner upon the musical art of this century has in some 
ways repressed rather than stimulated the produc- 
tivity of his contemporaries in the same sphere of 
production ; German opera has indeed been marked 



by few works that can be called " epoch-making." 
One living German composer, however, must be 
accorded a place among the immortals, Johannes 
Brahms, the defender of musical orthodoxy against 
the tendencies of the "music of the future." In 
him no quality of greatness is lacking. His ideas 
are marked by grandeur, wealth, and originality ; 
he uses the old forms with ease and power, or devel- 
ops them into new organisms, full of suggestion and 
opportunity for his successors ; the greatest of his 
works are marked both by deep expression and ex- 
quisite beauty, and none of his writings are without 
signs of genius. Brahms's principal works are dis- 
cussed and analyzed by Mr. Maitland with great 
intelligence and sympathy. The portraits and bib- 
liography connected with each sketch are valuable 
features of the volume. 



"Prose 
Fancies. 



Mr. Le Gallienne's book of " Prose 
Fancies " ( Putnam) is easy reading 
and gives the reader many pleasant 
moments. It is a pleasure not unmixed, for the 
good and the mediocre more than once join hands 
across the pages. If one could omit an unnecessary 
third or half of the volume he would have left a small 
handful of sketches whose charm is real. Mr. Le 
Gallienne, as one might surmise from the fine por- 
trait that faces the title-page, possesses a delicate 
fancy and clear insight. He is at his best, in this vol- 
ume, when he writes of serious things seen in the garb 
of graceful metaphor. His best mood is romantic, 
and when writing in that mood he produces some- 
thing that has the flavor of poetry and the outward 
form of art. Sometimes he turns out a sentence 
that penetrates quite through the surface ; as when 
he speaks of " that delicate instinct for proportion, 
which is one of the most precious attributes of what 
we call a gentleman." Humor he has, too, which is 
pleasantest when it skims lightly over a subject; 
the avowedly humorous pieces in the book smack- 
ing often of hack-work. The book has no one 
theme : the five and twenty sketches are unrelated, 
and range from facetious satire to thoughtful mus- 
ing on the Ewigiveibliche. If a common aim may 
be found, it is that the various papers protest against 
shams and unrealities. 



Repetitions and The many who feel that the more 
parallelisms in subtle effects of verse structure are 
English wrse. lef t un t ou ched by the ordinary met- 
rical analysis will open with interest a little volume 
by Professor C. Alphonso Smith, entitled " Repeti- 
tions and Parallelisms in English Verse " (Univer- 
sity Publishing Company). These terms were used 
by Longfellow in writing of the characteristics of 
the verse (imitated from the Finnish) in his " Hia- 
watha "; but it is in Poe and Swinburne that the 
wonderful poetical capabilities of repetition and par- 
allelism appear in their full development. Professor 
Smith has traced the employment of these devices 
from the early ballads, through Coleridge, to Poe ; 
and from Poe, through Baudelaire, to Swinburne.

With an ear sensitive to catch the most delicate ef- 
fect, he at times, perhaps, tries to point out har- 
monies that do not exist ; but the reader will thank 
him for bringing out some hidden beauties that may 
have hitherto escaped him. No attempt is made to 
give a psychological explanation of the effects. 

Historical studies If Mr " CharleS Sea1 ' 8 Baldwin's In- 

of the English flections and Syntax of the Morte 
language. D' Arthur " is an earnest of what may 

be expected from Messrs. Ginn & Co.'s plan of co- 
operation with scholars in publishing works of special 
rather than of general interest, the publishers de- 
serve for this plan the thanks of the learned world. 
Mr. Baldwin's book is a real contribution to the 
history of the English language, giving a clear state- 
ment, with copious and even exhaustive exemplifi- 
cation, of the main features of the language as fixed 
for the nonce in the usage of Malory. The sections 
treating of the verb ablaut, and of prepositions, are 
especially good. The faults of the book are not se- 
rious : the index should be fuller ; much might fitly 
have been treated here that has been left, presum- 
ably, to lexicography. The author's commendable 
intention of editing selections from the " Morte 
D' Arthur " for school use will, when carried out, 
increase greatly the value of the present work. 

Mr. William Blake's "The Cross, 
The Cross as a Ancient and Modern " (Randolph) 

religious symbol. , . .... . ' 

gives much interesting information 
regarding the cross as a religious symbol. Part L, 
" The Cross in the Orient," shows that it was used 
among the Early Aryans, the old Egyptians, Baby- 
lonians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and other pre-Chris- 
tian peoples. The various forms svastika, tau, 
etc., are mentioned, and their meanings suggested. 
The Christian cross, and its variations in art, her- 
aldry, and architecture, are briefly considered. Part 
II., " The Cross in the Occident," presents the evi- 
dence regarding this symbol among North Amer- 
ican tribes before white settlement. The crosses of 
Mexico, of the Mississippi Valley Mound-building 
tribes, etc., are described. The style of the work is 
simple and readable, and the many illustrations 
more than a hundred add to the value of the book. 



Stratford 



" Shakespeare's Stratford " (Scrib- 
ner) is a thin volume of wood-cuts 
and pictured. and descriptive letter-press of which 

Mr. Hallsworth Waite is the draughtsman and au- 
thor. The writing is interesting, and many of the 
sketches are decidedly good. Stratford and vicin- 
ity is the field of the artist's pilgrimage, and the 
book records his impressions in simple prose and un- 
affected drawing. The eye for the picturesque is 
manifest, and if the sixty or more of illustrations 
never rise to brilliancy, they are never less than 
worthy of their theme. The book is a pleasant 
" souvenir volume " to the Stratford visitor, and a 
tantalizing glimpse of Shakespeare's town and coun- 
try to the stay-at-home reader of the plays. 



"Character Studies" (Whittaker), 
Character studies b Mr Frederick Saunders, the ven- 

of literary folk. J , . . . 

erable Astor librarian, is a volume 
containing pleasant and unassuming sketches of six 
distinguished literary persons whom it has been the 
author's good fortune to meet or to know. Edward 
Irving, Mrs. Jameson, Bryant, Longfellow, Wash- 
ington Irving, and Joseph Green Coggswell are the 
six, and the distinctive quality of their personalities 
is set forth in these wide-margined pages. The lit- 
erary criticism is genial rather than acute, the au- 
thor's admiration cleaving first of all to those traits 
that go to make up manhood. The first word of 
the title is thus to be taken in its moral signification, 
and its promise is adequately fulfilled in a book 
that is, in the pleasanter sense of a much abused 
word, instructive. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

A volume of " Selections from the Poems of Arthur 
Hugh Clough " (Macmillan) has been added to the 
" Golden Treasury " series. " The Bothie of Tober-na- 
vuolich " fills the first half of the pretty little volume ; 
selections from " Dipsychus "and " Amours de Voyage," 
with a few miscellaneous pieces, make up the second 
half. " Mari Magno " is not represented. The best of 
Clough is between these covers, and we fancy that pos- 
terity will still further sift his slender product, and 
really treasure not more than a score of pages. 

Miss Frances E. Lord, of Wellesley College, has done 
a simple but much-needed piece of work in her little 
book on "The Roman Pronunciation of Latin" (Ginn). 
The work consists of two parts, " Why We Use It " and 
" How to Use It." In the former we have collected the 
evidence upon which our knowledge of the pronunciation 
is based; in the latter we have a number of helpful sug- 
gestions to teachers. There are many thousands of sec- 
ondary school and college teachers in this country who 
need just such a book as this, both for help in their daily 
work, and for the confuting of those uninformed per- 
sons (still found here and there) who imagine (and say) 
that we do not really know how Cicero and Quintilian 
pronounced their native speech. 

Dr. George Hempl, of the University of Michigan, 
deserves the thanks of all teachers of English for his 
admirable brochure on " Chaucer's Pronunciation and 
the Spelling of the Ellesmere MS." (Heath) . The pam- 
phlet is just what is needed by school and college teach- 
ers. It is better than Professor Skeat's introduction to 
" The Man of Lawe's Tale," and the phonetic basis of 
its exposition is strictly scientific. The author recom- 
mends its use in connection with Dr. Sweet's " Second 
Middle-English Primer," to be followed by the Morris- 
Skeat edition of the " Prologue " and " Knighte's Tale." 

We had hoped to find space for a notice of the Hon. 
William Warren Vernon's " Readings on the Inferno of 
Dante " (Macmillan) adequate to the great importance 
of the work, but a brief description must suffice. It is 
similar in plan to the companion work on the " Purga- 
torio," of which a second edition is promised. Text, 
translation, and commentary run along together, filling 
the thirteen hundred pages of two thick volumes. Al- 
though the " Readings " are said to be " chiefly based 
on the Commentary of Benvenuto da Imola," they are

really based upon the whole range of Dante literature, 
and if the student can have but one work of general 
criticism and exposition, this is decidedly the work that 
he must get. There is an introduction by the Rev. Ed- 
ward Moore. 

Commander Charles N. Robinson, R.N., has prepared 
a popular account of " The British Fleet " (Macmillan), 
which describes in compact form, with many curious and 
instructive cuts and plates, " the growth, achievements, 
and duties of the Navy of the Empire." The work has 
four sections, devoted, respectively, to the growth and 
history of the Royal Navy, its administration, its mate- 
rial, and its personnel. There is a good index, and an 
interesting appendix upon the paintings, drawings, and 
prints that have been reproduced for purposes of illus- 
tration. In spite of the many earlier books upon this 
subject, the present volume really seems to occupy a 
place hardly filled before. 

Dr. Norman Kerr's " Inebriety or Narcomania " (Tait) 
appears in a new and greatly enlarged edition. The au- 
thor's experience in the treatment of inebriates has made 
him one of the foremost authorities upon the subject of 
this book, and we need hardly add that he handles it in a 
thoroughly scientific way. He contends strongly that 
alcoholism and the allied forms of mania are diseases 
and should be treated as such. He gives a great num- 
ber of cases from his own exceptional experience to es- 
tablish this assertion, and presents also the treatment 
which he has found to be efficacious. Dr. Kerr is an 
attractive writer, and by avoiding the use of technical- 
ities he has produced a book which all classes can read 
intelligently. 

The usefulness of William Ramsay's " Manual of Ro- 
man Antiquities " has been amply tested by the expe- 
rience of over forty years. A fifteenth edition now ap- 
pears, revised and partly rewritten by Signor Rodolfo 
Lanciani, whose name is a sufficient guarantee that the 
work has been brought down to the date of the most 
recent excavations. The work, which is imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, is a substantial volume 
of nearly six hundred pages, illustrated with woodcuts 
and full-page photogravure* plates. 

The late Dr. John Bradshaw was the compiler of " A 
Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Milton " 
(Macmillan) now published, and perhaps more needed 
than a concordance of any other English poet yet un- 
provided with such apparatus. The earlier works of 
Todd, Prendergast, and Cleveland are manifestly inad- 
equate, and students will be thankful for this completer 
performance of the task. Dr. Bradshaw, who died a 
year ago, was the editor of Milton in the new " Aldine " 
series. The present volume contains four hundred dou- 
ble-columned pages. 

" Preparatory Physics " (Longmans), by Mr. Will- 
iam J. Hopkins, is a short laboratory course, mainly in 
mechanics, for schools of secondary grade. Mr. H. 
N. Chute's " Physical Laboratory Manual " (Heath) is 
a similar text-book, possibly a trifle more elementary, 
and undoubtedly more attractive in arrangement and 
presentation. Mr. J. Edward Taylor's " Theoretical 
Mechanics Fluids" (Longmans) is a small treatise 
especially devised for the unhappy English youth who 
are cramming for their examinations. The method is 
totally unlike that of the book just before mentioned. 

" An Elementary History of Art " (Imported by 
Scribner), by Mrs. Arthur Bell (" N. D'Anvers ") has 
long been a favorite among popular manuals. It now 



reappears in a fourth edition, carefully revised by the 
author. The work is used in England as a text-book 
in civil service examinations, a fact which testifies to its 
excellence. It attempts to cover the whole field archi- 
tecture, sculpture, and painting, is amply though not 
very satisfactorily illustrated, is well provided with in- 
dexes and glossaries, and its nearly six hundred pages 
are stoutly bound in half-leather. 

A group of recent publications for students and teach- 
ers of Latin, published by Messrs. Ginn & Co., com- 
prises the following books: "The First Latin Book," 
by Messrs. W. C. Collar and M. G. Daniel], of the Bos- 
ton schools; "Latin at Sight," by Mr. Edwin Post, a 
book which teachers ought to find particularly useful; 
an edition of " The Odes and Epodes of Horace," an- 
notated by Professor Clement Lawrence Smith; and 
" An Introduction to the Verse of Terrence," by Dr. 
H. W. Hayley. We may mention in this connection 
Mr. H. W. Auden's translation, from the sixth German 
edition, of Herr C. Meissner's " Latin Phrase Book " 
(Macmillan). 

The series of " Contributions to American Educa- 
tional History," edited for the Bureau of Education by 
Professor Herbert B. Adams, has just been augmented 
by four volumes of great value. They deal, respect- 
ively, with the history of education in Connecticut and 
Delaware, and of higher education in Iowa and Tennes- 
see. Each of these works is the study of a careful 
specialist, and treats exhaustively of its subject. When 
such a work shall have been done for every state in 
the Union, the historian of education in this country 
will have at hand something like an adequate collection 
of materials for his work, and it will be possible to pre- 
pare a general account of the subject with some claims 
to completeness. 

" A History of Our Own Times," by Mr. Justin Mc- 
Carthy, has been a very popular book ever since its ap- 
pearance ten or more years ago. The popularity is, on 
the whole, deserved, in spite of the Irish bias and jour- 
nalistic method of the writer, for nowhere else is so 
readable a summary of the Victorian period to be found. 
We now welcome a reissue of the work (Lovell),made 
more serviceable than ever by an extension from 1880 
to 1894, the work of Mr. G. Mercer Adam. The new 
edition is in two volumes, with a new index and some 
thirty portraits. It is also moderate in price. 

"From Monkey to Man; or, Society in the Tertiary 
Age " (Dibble) is the title of a romance of our remote 
ancestors, at the time when they were abandoning their 
earlier arboreal habit, and had discovered that two legs 
are better than four. Among other things, the book 
tells of " the great expedition from Cocoanut Hill and 
the wars in Alligator Swamp." Mr. Austin Bierbower 
is the author of this fanciful production, and Mr. H. R. 
Heaton has provided it with illustrations. There is not 
a little humor in the development of the plot, and we 
come now and then upon a touch obviously satirical of 
intent. 

" Stories from English History " (Macmillan), from 
Julius Csesar to the Black Prince, is well described by 
its title, the earlier sketches being given in the form of 
a dialogue, while those of a later period are plain tales. 
The author, the Rev. A. J. Church, M.A., has included 
both legend and fact; and though the stories are neces- 
sarily sketchy, they are as satisfactory as their extent 
permits. The illustrations are reproductions of ancient 
sculptures and engravings.

YORK TOPICS. 

New York, December 25, 1894. 

Literary movements and schools arise, reach their cul- 
mination, and decline, with such rapidity, nowadays, 
that it is a question whether the well-worn phrase, fin- 
de-siecle, should not be altered to apply to the close of 
each succeeding year. It was one B. Franklin, I be- 
lieve, a printer, who preached that immortal sermon, 
" The Ephemera," using for his mouthpiece the insect 
to whom the sum total of existence was compressed 
within a single day. And B. Franklin's typographical 
successor, Mr. T. DeVinne, might well preach another 
such sermon, based on observation of " the feeble fantasts 
and realists of the day," as they are styled by Mr. Whit- 
ing of the Springfield " Republican." Well, the real- 
ists have had their day or so at least Mr. Thayer de- 
clares in " The Forum," the fantasts are passing, and 
now we are wondering what will come after the ro- 
mancers. It is a good time, when everybody is indulg- 
ing in the festivities of the season and nobody is likely 
to hear you, to growl at literary and artistic vagaries. 

First of all, let me ask what we have done that the 
Beardsley women should be flaunted at us from the 
boardings, as is being done by bill-stickers for " The 
Masqueraders." We are tired of the Beardsley women 
already, but I suppose they will serve to " work " the 
multitude for some time yet, and we must endure. As 
to posters in general, the mania is spreading with fright- 
ful rapidity. " Art " is to be seen on every fence, and 
tell it not in Gath in every grocery window. For 
several months I have been admiring the successive pos- 
ters of some unknown but enterprising magazine dis- 
played in a neighboring shop. A specially striking 
winter-scene drew my close attention, and I found my- 
self perusing a summary of the estimable qualities of 

's soups. It is evident that we shall soon surpass 

the Frenchmen in their own field, and that the maga- 
zines will have to seek a new method of advertising. 
" Tomato-can pictures " will no longer serve as the de- 
signation of a popular Academician's pictures among 
his less-successful rivals, and why ? Because pictures 
on tomato cans will soon be conformed to " high art." 

Then there is Trilby." Caught at last ! How one 
sympathizes with Mr. Dick at times like these, and with 
his efforts to keep the head of Charles the First out of 
his Memorial ! But there is no help for it. " Trilby " 
must be mentioned, for " Trilby " is to be dramatized. 
Pray, Messrs. Harpers, and pray, Mr. Du Maurier, sup- 
press any more Trilby " posters. Let Mr. Palmer spell 
out the word in letters twenty feet high, if he chooses, 
but no pictures. Do not remove the last vestige of 
our enjoyment of them by such damnable iteration. Are 
we to have " Trilby " soap a la Svengali ! Are we to 
have Trilby " slippers ? Not in New York, at least, 
for they were several sizes too large in the story ! 
How about " Trilby " living pictures ? The brain reels 
at the thought of the revenues to be gained by farming 
out "Trilby" privileges. Judging by the crowds at 
the Fifth Avenue Galleries last week, a travelling art- 
gallery containing the original drawings would bring in 
an immense sum. I should be glad to receive one per 
cent for the suggestion. 

" Trilby " must be now approaching the two hundred 
thousand mark in the " States." A mere ten per cent 
of the retail price, $1.75, would net the author $35,000 
for that many copies. Who would not write a " Trilby," 
if he could, as your contemporary in this city remarks ? 



It was needless for that contemporary to repeat the old 
song, however, as to " why people, when they discuss 
the relations of authors and publishers, so seldom give 
the publisher credit for common business sense. They 
do not seem to understand that publishers, like most 
men, are doing business on business principles." Do n't 
they ? I warrant the authors do. This quotation would 
far better read, " I wonder why people, when they dis- 
cuss the relations of authors and publishers, so seldom 
give the author credit for common business sense. They 
do not seem to understand that authors, like most men, 
are doing business on business principles." How good 
that sounds. I hope Mr. Du Maurier made a fine bar- 
gain. No doubt he will be Baron Du Maurier, if the 
wind holds fair, and if he be eligible. 

Speaking of the profits of English novelists, there is 
one small item of American interest. Mr. Edward Bel- 
lamy's " Looking Backward " has just reached its four 
hundredth thousand. The sale for the past year or two 
has been slower but steady. He apparently has been 
following the practice of Mr. Hall Caine, of whom it is 
said that " he has no work on hand just now; he is en- 
joying the success of < The Manxman ' and meditating 
his next big book." Welcome, Messieurs les Anglais, 
to our golden grain, but restrain the tendency exhibited 
by certain eager brethren to put their feet in the trough. 
Dr. Horace Howard Furness is busily engaged at his 
country place in Wallingford, Penn., with the final 
proofs of the " Midsummer Night's Dream," which the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. will bring out in March. It was at 
one time rumored that Dr. Furness had given up fur- 
ther work on his "Variorum" edition of Shakespeare; 
but this is, happily, untrue. " Romeo and Juliet," by 
the way, the first of the series, appeared in 1871. The 
" Midsummer Night's Dream " will contain a very full 
discussion concerning the allegory contained in Oberon's 
vision of the "fair vestal throned by the West." The 
identity of the " little Western flower," referred to a few 
lines further on, is discussed by various authorities in 
some fifteen pages of fine type. Mary, Queen of Scots, 
and Lettice Knollys, wife of the Earl of Essex, are, I 
believe, the most likely originals. 

Of all the season's giftbooks, of the standard type, 
the " Holland " of Signor Edmondo de Amicis, trans- 
lated by Miss Helen Zimmern and published by Messrs. 
Porter & Coates, of Philadelphia, seems to me the most 
beautiful in its simple but elegant binding. The cover 
design embraces a delicate tracery of tulips, while 
the printing and the photogravures are as nearly per- 
fect as possible. The edition was sold out soon after 
publication, but a new supply was obtained in time for 
the late Christmas trade. This point is interesting as 
showing how large and constant the demand is for well- 
made standard works of literature. 

It is impossible to name all the literary, educational, 
and scientific events, which take place here at this season 
of the year. This week there is the seventh annual 
meeting of the American Economic Association, with a 
reception by President Low of Columbia. Next week 
will include the Memorial Meeting in honor of Robert 
Louis Stevenson; the recital of an act of Mr. Walter 
Damrosch's opera, " The Scarlet Letter," announced last 
year in this correspondence, for which Mr. George Par- 
sons Latfcrop has written the libretto; and the triennial 
Twelfth Night celebration of the Century Club, the 
only occasion on which all " strangers " are banished 
?rom the rooms of the most hospitable of the great New 
York clubs. ARTHUR STEDMAN>

Mrs. Anne Thackeray Ritchie, whose "Chapters of 
Unwritten Memoirs " are reviewed in this issue of THE 
DIAL, is reported to have under consideration the pre- 
paration of an annotated edition of her father's work. 

The Rev. George E. Ellis, President of the Massa- 
chusetts Historical Society, died in Boston on the twenty- 
first of December, at the age of eighty. He was the 
author of many biographical, historical, and theological 
works. 

Dr. John Chapman, for many years editor of " The 
Westminster Review," and the intimate associate of 
George Eliot, Froude, Dr. Martineau, and Mr. Spencer, 
died early in December. For many years past he had 
practised medicine in Paris, although he still kept his 
hold upon the " Review." 

A " Social England " series, edited by Mr. Kenelm L. 
Cotes, is announced by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. The 
first volume to appear will be " Troubadours and Courts 
of Love," by Mr. J. F. Rowbotham. Other volumes will 
be "The English Manor," by Professor Vinogradoff; 
and " The Pre-Elizabethan Drama," by Miss Lucy Toul- 
inin Smith. 

The name of Lord Rosebery heads the list of a com- 
mittee organized to secure the purchase of Carlyle's 
house in Cheyne Road, Chelsea. It is hoped to make 
a Carlyle Museum of the building. A fund of about 
4000 is needed, and subscriptions are invited. Re- 
mittances may be made to Mr. A. C. Miller, 61 Cecil 
St., Manchester, England. 

Mr. L. J. B. Lincoln, the editor of " Uncut Leaves," 
has begun the issue of a " monthly letter of advance 
criticism and literary information." The first number 
has appeared, and consists of twelve pages of fresh and 
readable comment upon books recently, or ablaut to be, 
published, as well as notes upon the doings of literary 
folk in New York and elsewhere. 

Our imports of books and other printed matter for 
the first nine months of last year amounted to a little 



over two and a half millions of dollars, nearly half being 
dutiable. This is a falling-off of about twenty-five per 
cent from the figures for the corresponding period of 
1893. During the same nine months we exported books 
to the value of one and three-quarters millions of dollars. 
The publication of that valuable weekly, " Science," 
has just been resumed, under the direction of an edi- 
torial committee whose membership includes such lead- 
ers of American scientific thought as Professors New- 
comb, Mendenhall, Pickering, Remsen, LeConte, Davis, 
Marsh, Brooks, Brinton, and Cattell. We heartily 
welcome the reappearance of the periodical after its long 
eclipse. 

Dr. John Lord, the well-known writer and lecturer 
upon history, died at his home in Stamford, Conn., on 
the fifteenth of December. He was one of the men of 
1809, and his birthday was that of Mr. Gladstone, De- 
cember 29. " Beacon-Lights of History " is his most 
widely-read work. The Rev. Alex. S. Twombly, D.D., 
of Newton, Mass., is preparing a memoir of Dr. Lord. 
He would gladly receive memoranda of fact, letters 
from Dr. Lord, etc., and, in all cases where it is requested, 
will carefully preserve and return such material after 
having copied from it what may suit his purposes. 

A Memorial Meeting in honor of the late Robert 
Louis Stevenson will be held in the great auditorium of 
the Carnegie Music Hall, New York, on the evening of 
January 4. It will be held under the auspices of Mr. 
Lincoln's " Uncut Leaves " Society and the St. Andrews 
Society, of that city, leading authors, artists, editors, 
and business men cooperating. Mr. Edmund Clarence 
Stedman will preside and deliver the opening address. 
Speeches are expected from Messrs. Richard Henry 
Stoddard, Andrew Carnegie, William Winter, George 
W. Cable, Parke Godwin, David Christie Murray, and 
others. Mr. Nelson Wheatcroft will recite a ballad and 
a selection from a story by Stevenson, and musical in- 
terludes will be given by an orchestra. 

In Whittier's lately published Letters several refer- 
ences are made to the poem of " Barbara Frietchie," 
the historical basis of which has more than once been 
called in question. A note from Mr. Whittier to the 
editor of this journal, not included in the recent col- 
lection, touches the point at issue, though, it must be 
admitted, not very conclusively. The note is dated from 
Amesbury, Nov. 15, 1885, and in it Mr. Whittier says: 
" Of the substantial truth of the heroism of Barbara 
Frietchie I can have no doubt. Mrs. E. D. N. South- 
worth, the novelist, of Washington, sent me a slip from 
a newspaper, stating the circumstance as it is given in 
the poem, and assured me of its substantial correctness. 
Dorothea L. Dix, the philanthropic worker in the Union 
hospitals, confirmed it. From half a dozen other sources 
I had the account, and all agree in the main facts. 
Barbara Frietchie was the boldest and most outspoken 
Unionist in Frederick, and manifested it to the Rebel 
army in an unmistakable manner." 

The " Saturday Review," under the new management 
of Mr. Frank Harris, is making a fierce attack upon the 
new Oxford School of English Literature. The follow- 
ing is a specimen of the slashing sort of criticism that 
is being served up weekly: " The curriculum of the new 
School of English Language and Literature at Oxford 
is now before us. To say that it justifies our fears of 
what such a Board of Studies, as the Board appointed 
for the regulation of this School, would be likely to pro- 
duce, would be to give a very imperfect idea of so de-

of ignorance, for the boundary dates assigned to par- 
ticular epochs in our literature are often as muddled 
as they are misleading, while the selection of books 
prescribed for special study displays utter inability to 
distinguish between what is and what is not character- 
istic and significant in the works of individual authors, 
both particularly in relation to the authors themselves 
and generally in relation to the era at which such works 
appeared; of incompetence, for two -thirds of what 
constitutes a literary education in the true sense of the 
term an adequate acquaintance with classical litera- 
ture, a knowledge of the principles of criticism, the 
possession of a good style, of sound judgment, of refined 
taste, and the like are in the provisions of this curric- 
ulum simply ignored. Regarded as a curriculum of 
Philology it is most inadequate. Regarded as a cur- 
riculum in Literature it is literally below contempt."

PHILIP AND HIS WIFE. 

By Mrs. DELAND, author of " John Ward, Preacher," 
" Sidney," The Old Garden," " Little Tommy Dove," 
"The Story of a Child." Fourth Edition. 16mo,$1.25. 
"An interesting and absorbing romance. . . . Margaret 
Deland is not only a thoughtful and philosophical student of 
life ; it is not her sole gift to be able to understand character 
and paint it before our eyes ; but she has the power of literary 
phrase, and her novel is one of those rare creations in our slip- 
shod era of a story as well written as it is interesting." Lon- 
don Telegraph. 

"A book of genuine originality and power." New York 
Tribune. 

THE STORY OF LAWRENCE QARTHE. 

By Mrs. KIRK, author of " The Story of Margaret Kent," 

" Ciphers," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

" I have had a delightful feast, charming and absorbing 
from beginning to end. ... It is all fascinating ; and the 
plot is managed so admirably throughout. To say that the 
conversations were brilliant is mere trite commonplace. Not 
a word of them can be skipped." HORACE HOWARD FUR- 
NESS, LL.D. 

C(EUR D'ALENE. 

A dramatic account of riots in the Creur d'Alene mines 
in 1892, with an engaging love story. By MARY 
HALLOCK FOOTE, author of " John Bodewin's Testi- 
mony," "The Led-Horse Claim," "In Exile," etc. 
16mo, $1.25. 

"Mrs. Foote ranges through the whole gamut of Rocky 
Mountain life, and every scene she pictures is drawn with 
startling vividness ; yet still, with the artist's instinct, she 
idealizes all she touches. Her minuteness of observation and 
remarkable fidelity to nature, combined with a rare dramatic 
power and a luminous beauty of style, place Mrs. Foote among 
the very few of our leading female writers of fiction. . . . 
The movement of the story is rapid, the interest most intense, 
and the event almost tragic ; but the narrative is interspersed 
with many a scene sparkling with humor and brilliant dia- 
logue." Books (Denver). 



DANVIS FOLKS. 

By ROWLAND E. ROBINSON, author of "Vermont," in 
the American Commonwealth Series. 16mo, $1.25. 
"There is a prejudice against dialect stories, because so 
many have been written for the mere literary effect and in 
the desire of quaintness through the use of perverted spelling. 
But when, as in this case, they are the result of a close and 
loving study of the local peculiarities of a region, they belong 
to an order of fiction of the best sort. . . . As a specimen of 
the New England dialect of the past, this story is admirable. 
. . . Very pleasant and entertaining reading. " TAe Church- 
man (New York). 

THE WHITE CROWN, and Other Stories. 

By HERBERT D. WARD. 16mo, $1.25. 
" Mr. Ward's stories, every one, have the supreme merit 
of being interesting." The Churchman (New York). 



SWEET CLOVER: 
A Romance of the White City. 

A charming love story, inwoven with phases of the 
Great Fair. By CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM, author 
of " Next Door," " Dr. Latimer," " Miss Bagg's Sec- 
retary," etc. Sixth Edition. 16mo, $1.25. 
" Mrs. Burnham has laid the scenes of her pleasant, pure- 
toned romance among the glories of the White City. It is 
delightful to have them reanimated in such a vivid manner, 
for their significance and their art are treated with a moral 
perspective that is not destroyed by too much effusion. . . . 
' Sweet Clover ' is one of the most agreeable tone stories which 
have appeared for a long time." Literary World (Boston). 
" The sights, sounds, and sentiment of the Columbian Ex- 
position are reproduced here as if by magic." Public Ledger 
(Philadelphia). 

THE GREAT REFUSAL: 

Letters from a Dreamer in Gotham. By PAUL E. MORE. 

16mo, $1.00. 

" It is in the form of letters, in which the supreme themes 
of love and religion are dealt with by an inquirer. It will 
take some study, perhaps, to rightly catch the spirit of these 
letters, abounding in poetry of the highest quality, but this 
spirit once caught there is in them a fascination and a charm 
which will hold the attention of the reader." Boston Ad- 
vertiser. 

THE CHASE OF SAINT CASTIN, 
And Other Tales. 

By Mrs. CATHERWOOD, author of " The Lady of Fort 
St. John," " Old Kaskaskia," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
" The special field of Mrs. Catherwood's labors lies far 
back of the reach of recollection, but she is one of the few 
writers who can really project themselves into the remote past, 
and whose sympathies can find in the mustiest of records the 
palpitating life that most of us can find only in the memory 
of what we have personally known. To praise her new vol- 
ume of seven stories, headed by ' The Chase of Saint Castin,' 
is but to repeat what we have said upon many earlier occa- 
sions, for the touch is still delicate and firm, the charm un- 
failing." The Dial (Chicago). 



THE BELL-RINGER OF ANGEL'S, 
And Other Stories. 

By BRET HARTE. 16mo, $1.25. 
"There is something in the writing of Mr. Bret Harte 
which we find in the writing of no other American author, 
and no English author either, except Charles Dickens, and 
that is the power of holding his readers in spite of themselves. 
. . . ' The Bell-Ringer of Angel's ' exercises the old charm 
over us." Mail and Express (New York). 



BAYOU FOLK. 

By KATE CHOPIN. 16mo, $1.25. 
" These Creole and Arcadian tales are so fine that no words

"Most complete and interesting account of the Civil War 
which has ever been published. We unhesitatingly recom-

$1.75. 

" This contribution to the admirable ' Story of the Na- 
tions ' Series is, without exception, one of the very finest of 
the series we have yet seen. Archer and Kingsf ord have de- 
voted great care to research (yielding nothing to accuracy) 
and to desire to be vivid in presenting history, but combining 
both fidelity to fact and vigor of style to an unusual degree. 
The book is admirable from start to finish accurate, vivid, 
thorough." Richmond Times.

Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard, in the Mail and Express,

to remain unknown to us long. No other young poet whose 
name is known to us, certainly none of American growth, could 
have written some of these classical poems. They are valu- 
able additions to our scanty store of genuine and noble clas- 
sical verse."

" The author has admirably accomplished his object, and

perior entertainment to his readers. He has evidently util- 
ized every available source of information. Beyond a ques- 
tion this work is one which will receive a hearty welcome 
from men of refined literary tastes, as well as those who have 
given but little time to the study of ancient history." New 
Haven Leader. 

" The history and local color of the time is admirably pre- 
served, and the author has the charm of making his readers 
feel the personality of his characters. The style is fluent and 
the volume worthy of praise." Boston Times.

CHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI. 

The last day of the year just ended brought 
news of the death of Miss Rossetti, the young- 
est of that famous quartette of brothers and 
sisters of whom Mr. W. M. Rossetti is now 
left the sole survivor. Maria Francesca, who 
died in 1876, was the oldest of the four, hav- 
ing first seen the light in 1827. Then came 
Dante Gabriel in 1828, William Michael in 
1829, and Christina Georgina in 1830. Miss 
Rossetti gave early evidence of her poetic tal- 
ents, as is shown by the privately-printed vol- 
ume of "Verses," dated 1847. In 1850, with 
her brothers, she wrote for the famous " Germ," 



over the pseudonymous signature of " Ellen 
Alleyne." It was not, however, until 1862 
that she took her destined place among the 
greater Victorian poets, with " Goblin Market 
and Other Poems." That volume was followed, 
in 1866, by " The Prince's Progress and Other 
Poems," and, in 1881, by "A Pageant and 
Other Poems." It is upon the contents of these 
three collections that Miss Rossetti's reputation 
must rest, although she did a considerable 
amount of other literary work. Before discuss- 
ing the character of her poems, we may dispose 
of the other books by a simple enumeration. 
' " Commonplace and Other Short Stories " 
(1870) and "Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme- 
Book" (1872) are titles that speak for them- 
selves. " Speaking Likenesses," a volume of 
"quasi- allegorical prose," and " Annus Domini : 
A Prayer for Every Day in the Year," both 
bear the date 1874. " Seek and Find," " Called 
to the Saints," and " Letter and Spirit," three 
religious works in prose, date from 1879, 1881, 
and 1883, respectively; while "Time Flies," 
a reading diary in alternate verse and prose, 
appeared in 1885, and was, we believe, her last 
published volume. These devotional books, 
which have both found and deserved a large 
and appreciative audience, are distinctly out of 
the common, but the spirit which finds expres- 
sion in them finds utterance still more intense 
and rapturous in the three volumes of song to 
which we now turn. 

It is not the least of the glories of English, 
poetry that two women should be numbered! 
among the singers whom we most love and! 
honor. It is perhaps idle to inquire whether 
Mrs. Browning or Miss Rossetti is to be es- 
teemed the greater poet ; the one thing certain 
is that no other English woman is to be named 
in the same breath with them. These two 
stand far apart from the throng, lifted above 
it by inspiration and achievement, and no ac- 
count of the greater poetry of our century can 
ignore them. If there is something more in- 
stinctive, more inevitable in impulse, about the 
work of Mrs. Browning, there is more of re- 
straint and of artistic finish about the work of 
Miss Rossetti. The test of popularity would 
assign to the former the higher rank, just as 
it would place Byron above Keats and Cole- 
ridge, or above Wordsworth and Shelley ; but 
the critic has better tests than the noisy verdicts.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



of the multitude, and those tests lessen, if they 
do not quite do away with, the seeming dispar- 
ity between the fame of the two women. 

The longer pieces which introduce Miss Ros- 
setti's three volumes are not the most success- 
ful of their contents. It is rather to the lyrics, 
ballads, and sonnets that the lover of poetry 
will turn to find her at her best. Who, for 
example, could once read and ever forget such 
a sonnet as " Rest " ? 

" Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes ; 

Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth ; 

Lie close around her ; leave no room for mirth 
With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs. 
She hath no questions, she hath no replies, 

Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth 

Of all that irked her from the hour of birth, 
With stillness that is almost Paradise. 
Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her, 

Silence more musical than any song ; 
Even her very heart hath ceased to stir : 

Until the morning of Eternity 

Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be ; 
And when she wakes she will not think it long." 

Or" who could escape the haunting quality of 
such a lyric as this : 

" When I am dead, my dearest, 

Sing no sad songs for me ; 
Plant thou no roses at my head, 

Nor shady cypress-tree ; 
Be the green grass above me 

With showers and dewdrops wet ; 
And if thou wilt, remember, 

And if thou wilt, forget. 

" I shall not see the shadows, 

I shall not feel the rain ; 
I shall not hear the nightingale 

Sing on, as if in pain : 
And dreaming through the twilight 

That doth not rise nor set, 
Haply I may remember, 

And haply may forget." 

The poem just quoted can hardly fail to re- 
call, in feeling, thought, and measure, Mr. 
Swinburne's " Rococo," and thus emphasizes the 
spiritual relationship of the author to the poets 
of the group sometimes styled " Pre-Raphael- 
ite." Similarly, the perfect lyric called " Dream- 
Land " is clearly akin to " The Garden of 
Proserpine," and it is not difficult to discern 
the same sort of kinship between Miss Rossetti's 
" Up-Hill " and Mr. Swinburne's " The Pil- 
grims." Now the point to be noted is that all 
three of Miss Rossetti's poems were published 
in the volume of 1862, while the three Swin- 
burnian poems date from several years later. 
There is, of course, no question of imitation 
in each case what remains a simple theme with 
the one poet is elaborated into a symphony by 
the other but it is difficult to escape the con- 
clusion that the man was influenced by the wo- 
man in all three of the cases. Particularly with 
" Up-Hill " and " The Pilgrims," we note the 



common use of the dialogue form and the ab- 
solute identity of the austere ethical motive. 

Miss Rossetti's verses sometimes suggest 
those of other poets, but we always feel that 
her art is distinctly her own. The divine sim- 
plicity of Blake is echoed in such a stanza as 

" What can lambkins do 

All the keen night through ? 
Nestle by their woolly mother, 
The careful ewe." 

The melting, almost cloying, sweetness of the 
Tennysonian lyric meets us in these verses : 

" Come to me in the silence of the night ; 

Come in the speaking silence of a dream ; 
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright 
As sunlight on a stream ; 

Come back in tears, 
O memory, hope, love of finished years." 

As for the influence of the great Italian, which 
shaped so powerfully the thought of every mem- 
ber of the Rossetti family, it is less tangible 
here than in the work of her greater brother, 
yet to it must be attributed much of the ten- 
derness and the pervasive mysticism of her 
poems. It is perhaps most apparent in the two 
sonnet-sequences, " Monna Innominata " and 
" Later Life," both included in the volume of 
1881. And the influence of that brother who 
bore the sacred name of the Florentine is like- 
wise intangible but pervasive. We get a 
glimpse of it in " Amor Mundi," for example, 
and in many a vanitas vanitatum strain. But 
we must repeat that Miss Rossetti's genius was 
too original to be chargeable with anything 
more than that assimilation of spiritual influ- 
ence from which no poet can hope wholly to es- 
cape, and which links together in one golden 
chain the poetic tradition of the ages. 

If in most of the provinces of the lyric realm 
Miss Rossetti's verse challenges comparison 
with that of our greater singers, it is in the 
religious province that the challenge is most 
imperative and her mastery most manifest. 
Not in Keble or Newman, not in Herbert or 
Vaughan, do we find a clearer or more beau- 
tiful expression of the religious sentiment than 
is dominant in Miss Rossetti's three books. In 
this respect, at least, she is unsurpassed, and 
perhaps unequalled, by any of her contempo- 
raries. In her devotional pieces there is no 
touch of affectation, artificiality, or insincerity. 
Such poems as " The Three Enemies " and 
" Advent " in the first volume, " Paradise " and 
" The Lowest Place " in the second, and many 
of the glorious lyrics and sonnets of the third, 
will long be treasured among the religious clas- 
sics of the English language. Perhaps the 
poet's highest achievement in this kind is the 



1895.]

" Old and New Year Ditties " of the first vol- 
ume. Some such claim, at least, has been made 
by no less an authority than Mr. Swinburne for 
the closing section of the poem. 

" Passing away, saith the World, passing away ; 
Chances, beauty, and youth sapped day by day ; 
Thy life never continueth in one stay. 
Is the eye waxen dim, is the dark hair changing to gray 
That hath won neither laurel nor bay ? 
I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May : 
Thou, root-stricken, shalt not rebuild thy decay 
On my bosom for aye. 
Then I answered : Yea. 

" Passing away, saith my Soul, passing away ; 
With its burden of fear and hope, of labor and play ; 
Hearken what the past doth witness and say : 
Rust in thy gold, a moth is in thine array, 
A canker is in thy bud, thy leaf must decay. 
At midnight, at cock-crow, at morning, one certain day 
Lo, the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay : 
Watch thou and pray. 
Then I answered : Yea. 

*' Passing away, saith my God, passing away : 
Winter passeth after the long delay ; 
New grapes on the vine, new figs on the tender spray, 
Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May, 
Though I tarry, wait for Me, trust Me, watch and pray. 
Arise, come away, night is past, and lo it is day, 
My IOTC, My sister, My spouse, thou shalt hear Me say. 
Then I answered : Yea." 

It is peculiarly fitting that the author of these 
fervid and solemn verses, written for one New 
Year's season, should herself have passed away 
on the very eve of another. 



NOVELS AND NOVEL READERS. 

Just as the term father implies the correlative 
term child, so does a novel imply a novel reader. 
It were hard to imagine a piece of fiction without 
an audience, even if the audience number but one 
and be furnished by the author himself. Readers, 
then, being necessary, it touches the quick of the 
fictionist's interest to inquire: What is the attitude 
of the present-day patrons of tales towards the dif- 
ferent kinds of fiction purveyed for their delecta- 
tion? Is the purpose-novel preferred, or the light 
and cynical analytic study, or the frankly objective 
adventure-tale of your true romanticist? Would 
Mrs. Ward win the popular plebiscite, or Mr. Ben- 
son, or Messrs. Stevenson, Doyle, and Weyman? 

Of course a categorical reply could only be made 
on the basis of counting noses : the pure mathemat- 
ics, of the problem will always be out of reach. 
Still, what with the test of sales, the talk of society, 
and the a posteriori analyses of the critics, an opin- 
ion of some solidity may be attained. The writer 
has made a point of conversing with divers sorts of 
folk who care for fiction (and who, outside of the 
absolutely illiterate class, does not care for it?), and 
has been both interested and instructed by the tes- 
timony thus derived. Blending the illumination 
gained in this way with that from other sources, he 
has concluded that novel-readers may be divided, 



roughly, into three classes : first, those who care for 
fiction as art primarily, and get their main pleasure 
from its truth to life, its character analysis, and its 
construction ; second, those whose interest centres 
in the thesis of the book, and who care little or 
nothing for form, style, and other distinctively lit- 
erary features ; and third, those to whom a novel is 
above all else a story, something to amuse and 
charm, an organism with movement, and zest of life. 
That division of novel-readers which looks for 
and relishes to the full the art of a bit of fiction is 
comparatively small, and for obvious reasons. Here 
belong the critics, the connoisseurs of literature. To 
such it matters not so much if a story be pleasant, 
or whether or not it teaches sound morality and su- 
perinduces a better opinion of one's fellow-men. If 
it have construction, vital character-drawing, and 
verisimilitude, if it possesses stylistic distinction and 
dramatic power, they are satisfied. The analytic 
student of the novel comes in the course of time to 
put his attention on these things to the exclusion of 
everything extraneous ; he reads more as a scientist 
and less as a human being. This is at once the 
privilege and the penalty of the critical function. 
It is only the very great books that can wrest him 
from this self-conscious and dubious coign of vant- 
age and set him cheek by jowl with ordinary hu- 
manity, breathless in watching a piece of life and 
personally involved in the fortunes of the dramatis 
personce in the grip of the sweetest and'strongest 
of obsessions. Such, as a rule, is the critic's place 
and state of mind. Not always, even in his case, 
however. Mr. Andrew Lang, suffering, one might 
almost say, from a surfeit of culture, likes nothing 
so well as the novel with " go " and color and life, 
contradistinguished from that of analyses and the 
mooting of problems. Conceiving the end of art to 
be " pleasure, not edification," he makes a plea for 
"the Fijian canons of fiction," meaning thereby that 
those nawe natives in their stories " tell of gods and 
giants and canoes greater than mountains, and of 
women fairer than the women of these days, and of 
doings so strange that the jaws of the listeners fall 
apart." Mr. Lang, in short, is fond of beautiful 
impossibilities in a novel. But it is none the less 
fair to say that the critic-class, as such, reads with 
" Art for art's sake " perpetually engraven upon its 
censorious front. And it is also plain that the audi- 
ence thus furnished the fictionist is so small as to 
be numerically contemptible, and in the vulgar mat- 
ter of sales as unimportant as the p in pneumonia. 
To these professionals of criticism may be added a 
fraction of the reading public which uses their 
method, or in amateurish fashion, albeit honestly, 
follows in their wake. Very young persons whose 
education has been large and experience limited, and 
who for these reasons take themselves au grand 
serieux, and are more or less self-conscious in their 
psychological habitudes, belong here ; here belong, 
too, older, hardier, and more sensible people of a 
natural intellectual keenness, the ab ovo analysts of 
life, and of literature as its expression. These swear 



40 



[Jan. 16, 



by Mr. Howells's dicta, and, as to quality, are of 
the aristoi among readers, coveted by all genuine 
artists. But neither of these subsidiary classes 
swell the critic-class, caring for the art of a novel 
first of all, to proportions invalidating our claim 
that it is decidedly the smallest of the three, and, 
so far as immediate influence and the substantial 
return of figures is concerned, the least important. 
The second and larger class embraces readers 
who object not to didactics in their novels. To them 
a polemic in the guise of literature is as acceptable 
as a pill, sugar-coated to the taste, to the thorough- 
going homoeopathist. Many falling into this cate- 
gory enjoy literature per se, to be sure ; but they 
like it also to convey some thoughtful thesis, prefer- 
ring, so to say, the luxuriously cushioned barouohe 
of fiction to wrestling with the same problem in the 
Irish jaunting-car of sociology, or science. Hence is 
derived a good part of the audience rallying to the 
" Heavenly Twins " and " A Yellow Aster "; or 
that which a few years ago took up arms for " Rob- 
ert Elsmere." A part, not the whole, we must 
repeat; because these tendenzgeschichten, as the 
Germans call them, are far more than mere preach- 
ments and special pleadings; often containing the 
vivid characterization of flesh-and-blood creatures, 
the one red drop of human life which is precious. 
But it is undeniable that the immense amount of 
talk evoked by such books had never been forth- 
coming were they not a stage upon which to dis- 
play the puppets of theory and argument. Right 
here opinions violently clash, and schools form as 
naturally as rocks crystallize. Plenty of earnest 
and honest devotees of the novel will have it that 
art and story interest may be supplied in a book, 
plus the presentation of some vital question of the 
day, adding by so much to its importance and at- 
traction, and lifting fiction, traditionally regarded 
as a " light " division of literature, into a more le- 
gitimate place, until it ranks with serious (too often 
a synonym for dull) literature. It is, in fact, a lit- 
erary cult, at the present writing, to be " serious " 
in the novel ; as it was a social cult, during the re- 
cent panic, to be poor. It was the book more pain- 
fully and self-consciously didactic than any other 
in English fiction within several years, which pro- 
voked the most discussion not critical controversy 
so much as the more powerful unpredicable popular 
interest of society. The vogue and stimulation of 
Madame Grand's strong if unequal and inartistic 
essay in the field of social analysis were little short 
of phenomenal, although now, striking work in other 
sorts of fiction having since obscured it, one thinks 
of this study of the marital relation with Villon's 
refrain rising to the mind : " Where are the Snows 
of Yester-year?" For a season, it is even likely 
that the believers in purpose-fiction outnumbered 
not only the critical minority already characterized, 
but also the old-fashioned followers of the healthier 
tale whom we are to reckon with under our third 
division. For a season only, however, we should 
guess; there is a sort of rabies of interest which 



destroys by its own violence, and already may be 
seen the after-effects of what has been cleverly 
dubbed the " woman revolt in fiction." Still, this 
interest, this excitement, if temporary, has its sig- 
nificance, and goes to show that a wider and deeper 
appeal to humankind can be made through the novel, 
and will be made, an appeal touching grave ques- 
tions and the most sacred relations, as perhaps 
through no other form of the written word. It will 
not do to sneer at tendency literature as lying out- 
side of critical attention : Terence's line applies to 
literature even as to life, and nothing in fiction that 
broadly stirs his fellow men and women can be 
alien to the true critic's function. 

Yet it is plain, and to be plainly stated, that this 
popular furore over a dominant piece of purpose- 
fiction tends to obscure critical tests and canons. 
Those who read as they run, incline, under such in- 
fluence, to judge a work by the amount of imme- 
diate noise and intelligent comment it begets, and 
as a consequence one hears absurdly exaggerated 
encomium. " The Heavenly Twins," for example, 
is put on a par with " Marcella "; the truth being 
that beside Mrs. Ward's finished and masterful 
work of art, it is ill-constructed, false to life, faulty 
in drawing, and terribly diffuse, in fine, the jour- 
ney-work of a brilliant novice. The interest awak- 
ened by such a production is largely adventitious, 
because based on an appeal lying beyond artistic 
tests. It is well to have this clearly in mind here 
in the United States, where comparative criticism is 
but locally conceded, and where for this reason a 
stern insistence upon the criteria of artistic perfec- 
tion is of all places most needed. It is not cause 
for complaint that a host of readers, the palpable 
majority of whom are women, welcome novels hand- 
ling with more or less elan the relations of the sexes ; 
the repression, by the Anglo-Saxon traditions of 
convenance in fiction, of all that side of social phe- 
nomena, results, as might be expected, in an excess 
of curiosity and excitement which have their mor- 
bid manifestations ; but the residuum of all this fer- 
ment will be a broader outlook and a freer concep- 
tion of motifs. If, however, we do not learn to 
apply rigidly and with malice prepense to any fic- 
tion whatsoever, man-made or woman-begotten, the 
universal rules of art, a parlous state is ours. That 
section of society which elects the purpose-novel as 
its special pet and pride may gratify its taste under 
promise to exempt none of this popular product 
from the Rhadamanthian judgment by the which 
all fiction must be judged ; and with the agreement 
to keep clearly dissevered in their own minds the 
appeal of art and the appeal of thought. 

The readers of a more genial habit and a more 
traditional standard make up our third and final 
class. They care for a story for the story's sake, 
and, bothering not overmuch if its likeness to life 
be dubious, go so far as to open arms to a fine rep- 
resentation of the improbable. They stand by Bal- 
zac's phrase (rarely obeyed by the master himself) 
that the novelist should depict the world, not as it

is, but as it may possibly become. And it is this 
sort of folk, we would contend, which on the whole 
is the best-balanced, the most humanistic, and in 
the long run the most influential, among novel-read- 
ers. Mr. Howells inclines to contemn a species 
which, to his view, still loves the rattle and the 
woolly horse in literature. But if he, or any other 
seeker after truth, will pursue the Socratic method, 
conversing with fellow mortals in the chance jostle 
of the social plexus, he will get evidence pushing 
towards our conclusion. The fact is that, despite 
all our rather self-conscious prating about art, and 
notwithstanding our somewhat feverish enthusiasm 
over introspective social questions, the clear-headed 
and sound-hearted folk, who (thank heaven !) are 
the warp of our social fabric, do not care to fret 
and fume for any such thing. They go to the novel 
for rest, amusement, illusion ; as the lovers of Thack- 
eray and Dickens did, of Scott and Dumas; as 
thousands now are doing with " Trilby," as true a 
child of the elder romanticists as was ever born. 
They have a deep-seated prejudice against fiction 
with a bad ending; so far from wishing to have a 
great book stamped indelibly on the mind at a first 
contact, they are glad to possess, as a cultivated 
reader expressed it to the writer, "the pleasant 
habit of forgetting a novel," assuring additional de- 
light in the event of re-perusal. "The world is two- 
thirds bad, I know," says the Advocatus diabole to 
the stickler for high art and serious purpose. " Your 
' realism ' teaches me nothing, it simply repeats un- 
savory and belittling facts of life ; and I would have 
none of it. Give me lies rather than literal ities, or, 
better yet, the half-truths of a scene where the light 
is accented and the shadows put in corners where 
they belong." Now this is unphilosophic perhaps, 
but it is natural and (pace Mr. Howells and those 
who jump with him) it is healthy, very. The 
trouble with the Howellsian view of fiction is that 
it is professional, and so not generally applicable. 
He is perfectly right for himself. 

But to argue pro and con as to this attitude of 
the readers who clamor for pleasant and incident- 
thronged novels, and who are the casus essendi of 
the Romantic reaction we are now witnessing, is, 
after all, aside from our main line of argument. 
We are not justifying their position or attacking 
it : we would simply register the fact of their exist- 
ence, and express the conviction that, while equal in 
intelligence and possibly excelling in common-sense 
either of the two other classes, they are to-day, and 
will be more surely to-morrow, the strongest in num- 
bers, and thus for practical reasons are to be respect- 
fully regarded by the maker of tales. Mr. Craw- 
ford, in his chapters on "The Art of Fiction," 
insists that it is the novelist's primary business to pur- 
vey amusement. The believers in romances have a 
sneaking sympathy with this position, though many 
of them would claim, and rightly, that along with 
the pleasure may go a noble stimulation of ideals 
affording that instruction through the divine indi- 
rection of art which is as far removed from didac- 



ticism as from the irresponsibility of the thorough- 
going realist. The advantage of those whose view- 
hallo is for illusion lies in their being in the line of 
a wholesome tradition, since men and women have 
gone more steadily to fiction for just that than for 
aught else : and again, in their now perceptible and 
daily waxing in strength, a phenomenon due to the 
noticeable reaction, on the one side from the strained 
probing of psychologic problems ; on the other, from 
the art substituting form for substance and a qui- 
escent pessimism for the cheerful bustle and vigor 
of red-blooded humankind. It is an audience to 
depend on in any age, this of the romance readers, 
and in quality such that the writer of fiction may 
well trust himself to deserve its plaudits ; it is a con- 
stituency which he should hesitate to lose, even if 
there appear to be a temporary appetite for the mor- 
bid or the naturalistic. It is a backing which, year 
in and year out, will sell his books and establish his 
fame and make his copyright a valuable inheritance 
to his children. RICHARD BURTON. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"MIRABEAU AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION." 

-A REPLY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I request you to publish in the next issue of your 
esteemed journal the following statements, hoping and 
trusting that you will willingly do so in justice, not 
only to myself, but also to the readers of THE DIAL. 

Like every writer, I must expect to be criticized. 
Like every writer I have, however, a right to claim 
that my writings be not reviewed in such a way that 
readers of the criticism, who have not read the work 
criticized, must necessarily believe me to have written 
something totally different from what I have actually 
written. Without questioning in the least the motives 
of Mr. D. L. Shorey, the reviewer of my Lowell lec- 
tures on the French Revolution in THE DIAL, I charge 
him with having done so to the extent it possibly can 
be done without saying any direct untruth. The in- 
ferences drawn by Mr. Shorey from my statement in 
regard to Mirabeau's being and wanting to be a party 
by himself are his and not mine. The unbiased reader 
of the book will readily see why they are palpable fal- 
lacies, though at first sight they seem to be irrefutable 
logical conclusions. The only explanation of Mr. 
Shorey's misconception that I can find is that he seems 
to have read the lectures without paying any attention 
whatever to the statement of facts they contain. To 
hurl Mirabeau's exclamation, " Ah ! how the immoral- 
ity of my youth injures the public weal," as a shaft 
against me, is strange, for I quote it (II., 236), endorse 
it most emphatically, show its tremendous import with 
minute detail, make it in fact one of the two main pil- 
lars of my whole argument. The same holds good of the 
question of lack of confidence in Mirabeau to such a de- 
gree that I must fain believe Mr. Shorey to have skipped 
the twenty or more pages (scattered) treating of it. 

That Mirabeau " became a new man (when he en- 
tered public life at the time of the revolution)" he 
entered it much earlier, as Mr. Shorey can find briefly 
stated in the lectures " and the immorality of his 
youth should not be counted against him " is not

[Jan. 



" claimed " by me. Nowhere is such a statement made 
in the lectures, but they contain many a page showing 
very elaborately that my opinion is in truth much more 
nearly the directly opposite one than that I am made 
to hold. From Mr. Shorey's expatiations on the pay- 
ment Mirabeau received from the court, the reader 
must conclude that I either pass it over in silence or 
justify it. I state the facts much more fully than he 
does, charge him (M.) with being "sorrily unscrupu- 
lous about how he got the money he wanted to spend," 
declare his " extravagant joy " over the king's liber- 
ality " was more than undignified, it was revolting," 
but explain the transaction and reduce the charge of 
" venality " to what is warranted by the facts. Mr. 
Shorey does not make the slightest attempt at contro- 
verting the facts adduced by me. 

About Lafayette Mr. Shorey and I disagree. In his 
opinion there was no need of " having the searchlight 
of critical history turned upon " the general, for he 
says : " The conduct and character of Lafayette were 
well known long before any such search-light was dis- 
covered [! ?]. However it may be elsewhere, it was 
known at least in France and in the United States, that 
in a long life tried by many tests, the conduct of 
Lafayette was exceptionally consistent, and that it was 
uniformly governed not by passion, but by principle. In 
all emergencies he displayed the same high qualities." 
If Mr. Shorey thinks that that is the way in which 
not only one serious historical writer, but all critical 
history, can be disposed of, in case the results of investi- 
gation have the misfortune not to be to his taste and to 
run counter to wide-spread popular opinions well, 
then we differ, that is all. Again he does not make 
the slightest attempt at refuting the facts which I ad- 
duce of course only an infinitesimal part of those fur- 
nished, in my opinion, by Lafayette's whole career in 
support of my views, Lafayette himself being one of 
my authorities. Mr. Shorey's calling a charge " stale " 
does not undo incontestably-proved facts, and to hear 
in 1895 an unsubstantiated opinion of Sainte-Beuve in 
such a question quoted as decisive is surprising. To 
learn that Mirabeau was far from being free from 
blame in his relations to Lafayette, and that he at the 
same time grossly flattered and bitterly denounced him, 
the reader need not turn to Mr. Shorey's review ; it is 
freely stated and blamed, but besides explained in the 
lectures. 

If the main contents of my lectures can be said to 
be at all alluded to by Mr. Shorey, it is done in two or 
three words and in such a way that nobody can possibly 
guess from them what the thesis is I have tried to 
prove by the facts, or rather what I maintain to be 
demonstrated by the facts. jj VON JJOLST

DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

There has lately been originated in Chicago a type of 
libraries the career of which will greatly interest library 
workers in this country. The Newberry Library was 
the first, and now the Crerar Library seems to follow 
in its lead. Great general libraries have hitherto had 
their staff divided into departments according to the 
various classes of library work : there has been a 
catalogue department, a reference department, an ac- 
cession department, and so on. A cataloguer has been 
supposed to have in his head the most minute details of 



every science for cataloguing purposes. The refer- 
ence librarian had to be acquainted with the standard 
literature in all the different branches of human knowl- 
edge. In former times there were such encyclopaedic 
geniuses, who were able to grasp, as it were, the whole 
universe in one birds-eye view. That time is now past 
and gone for ever. Today every special science in- 
cludes more details than the whole field of scientific 
thought did fifty years ago. The librarian who would 
be something more than the go-between of the card 
catalogue and the shelves, who would be able to cata- 
logue and classify a collection of books without con- 
stantly consulting other catalogues, who would be able 
to rely upon his own knowledge, in short, one who 
would treat the library profession as he would one of 
the lines of an educator's work, must specialize. It was 
in recognition of this that the Newberry Library was 
organized as a " departmental " library, and that the 
Crerar Library now seems to be tending in the same 
direction. A couple of years ago, Miss Edith Clarke 
of the Newberry Library gave in the "Library Jour- 
nal " (September, 1891) a very interesting account of 
the working of the departments in the Newberry, and I 
refer the reader to this paper for more detailed inform- 
ation. These libraries are divided into departments of 
science, there will be one department of medicine, one 
of music, one of social sciences, and so on. This plan 
will enable each assistant in the library to become ac- 
quainted with every detail of the technical side of his 
work. In this way, furthermore, he will feel the neces- 
sity, and the possibility, of keeping his specialized 
knowledge up to date. As it is now in most libraries, 
the cataloguer, or the reference librarian, always feels 
the necessity of keeping himself acquainted with all the 
departments of science; and as this is an absolute im- 
possibility, he will either feel that he is not doing, and 
cannot do, his duty as well as he should, or and this 
is perhaps most often the case he will content him- 
self with a certain superficiality, will content himself 
with the scant knowledge he can pick up in looking 
through the current magazines and in glancing over the 
pages of the new books as they come under his eyes. 
In the departmental libraries, and in the special libra- 
ries, all this is changed. The librarian will feel that 
the field of literature with which he is to deal is within 
his grasp. He can pursue studies in the special line 
that interests him, without feeling that there are other 
things that he, in so doing, more or less neglects. In 
Europe, more especially in Germany and in the Scandi- 
navian countries, where, outside of the university libra- 
ries, few libraries of any importance exist, the library 
assistants are all university men ; and the tendency is to 
allow none but graduates (that is, doctors of philosophy 
and their equals) in the profession, because the librarian 
ought to be a specialist in any science and acquainted 
with scientific methods. This can be carried too far. 
The specialist will very often be narrow-minded, and 
in the library field nothing is more needed than men of 
broad minds. The departmental library, while giving 
the advantage of dividing the work on scientific lines, 
will keep the special departments in one organization, 
and thus facilitate the intercourse between the different 
departments. The staff of such a library will acquire 
the character of a university faculty, and this character 
will impose upon the members of the staff the unity of 
the special fields of work in which they are engaged.

MEMORIES OF SEVENTY YEARS.* 



" Threescore and Ten Years " is the title of 
a lively and readable, if at times rather sketchy, 
volume of reminiscences from the pen of Mr. W. 
J. Linton, the well-known engraver. While 
the book is largely a record of the author's 
impressions of the many distinguished people 
he met during his career in England and in 
this country, sufficient data are given to convey 
a fair notion of his own varied past and strong 
personality. Born at London in 1812, Mr. 
Linton was early apprenticed to George Wil- 
mot Bonner, wood engraver ; and wood engrav- 
ing has been, we take it, despite pretty constant 
activity in the fields of authorship, journalism, 
and political and philanthropic agitation, sub- 
stantially his sheet anchor and real calling 
through life. Mr. Linton's journalistic expe- 
rience has been, nevertheless, considerable. In 
18412 he was editor of a Chartist newspaper 
called the " Odd Fellow," and in 1845 of the 
"Illustrated Family Journal," which latter 
sheet he gave up in the same year to succeed 
Douglas Jerrold on the " Illustrated Maga- 
zine." In 1849 he was for a few weeks sub- 
editor, under Thornton Hunt, of the " Spec- 
tator "; and shortly after he joined Hunt in 
starting the " Leader," an ambitious journal 
which was to be " at once an organ of the 
European Republicans and the centre of an 
English republican party, after the manner 
of the National and the Reforms in Paris." 
The " Leader " of which Hunt was chief ed- 
itor, G. H. Lewes literary editor, and our au- 
thor editor for foreign matters did not last 
long. Says Mr. Linton : 

" I had soon to find that Hunt's and Lewes's sympa- 
thies with the Republican party were not to be depended 
on, that they merely wanted to exploit the connection 
for the commercial advantage of the paper . . . which 
led no whither, running, under the capricious direction 
of Hunt and Lewes, like Leigh Hunt's Irishman's pig, 
' up all manner of streets.' " 

As a free-lance journalist, Mr. Linton did 
yeoman service, both in prose and verse, in the 
twin causes of political liberalism and general 
philanthropy ; and he was an active speaker 
and organizer on the popular side during the 
Chartist and similar movements. As an author, 
his credit rests chiefly on an excellent treatise 
on his own art, " The Masters of Wood En- 

* THREESCORE AND TEN YEARS, 1820 to 1890: Recollec- 
tions. By W. J. Linton. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



graving " a work to which, he tells us, is due 
the fact that " the University of Yale has hon- 
ored me by conferring on me the degree of 
Master of Arts." For twenty-seven years Mr. 
Linton has been a resident of this country, a 
trip to the States in 1866 " to organize a party 
for Italy " leading to the more substantial and 
fruitful, if less imposing, result of his perma- 
nent engagement by Frank Leslie to conduct 
the pictorial portion of the " Illustrated News." 
It may be gathered from the foregoing facts 
that Mr. Linton has been a radical, or at least 
an advanced liberal, in politics universal re- 
publicanism of the vague, high-soaring, Giron- 
dist type being his ideal. He is akin, one may 
believe, to the class of minds dominant in the 
latter half of the eighteenth century, whose 
dogmas of human perfectibility and the divine 
right and innate virtue of that masterful ab- 
straction, the "people," nerved men like Robes- 
pierre and Saint Just to the commission of 
Utopian follies which even now, in the face of 
the lessons of 1794, we seem in some danger 
of seeing repeated. Writing of Mr. Linton to 
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy in 1849, Carlyle 
spoke as follows ; and we quote the description , 
not for its presumed literal accuracy, but be- 
cause we all know the sort of man Carlyle would 
be apt to apply it to : 

" Also do not much mind Linton, who is a well- 
enough meaning, but, I fear, extremely windy creature, 
of the Louis Blanc, George Sand, etc., species." 

Were we to try our own hand with the brush, 
we should perhaps paint Mr. Linton as one of 
those amiable and well-intentioned people who, 
seeing everything refracted through the mists 
of their own super-sensibility, make a life bus- 
iness of righting wrong and relieving distress, 
seldom distinguishing between unmerited pains 
and pains that are penalties, knocking the 
shackles off the innocent victim and the con- 
victed gallows-bird alike, and not seldom tak- 
ing their pay, like their immortal type in Cer- 
vantes, in the abuse and ridicule of their cli- 
ents. In revolutionary times Mr. Linton might 
have been a lesser Tom Paine, tempered and 
diluted with the humane vagaries of an Anach- 
arsis Clootz. As times went, he did a vast deal 
of not altogether futile writing, speechifying, 
and organizing, in behalf of oppressed Italians, 
Poles, Irish, of anybody, in short, that ap- 
peared to him to have a grievance, to the no 
small neglect, as he confesses, of his own proper 
work of engraving. 

Passing from our impressions of Mr. Linton 
to his impressions of others, we find a long list

[Jan. 16, 



of names, eminent or notorious, ranging from 
Herbert Spencer to Mme. Blavatsky ; from 
Carlyle to " Ben " Butler ; from A. Bronson 
Alcott to Mace the pugilist ; from Tennyson 
to Tupper the latter of whom might have 
passed, says Mr. Linton, " as a most respecta- 
ble grocer and possible church-warden "; from 
Swinburne to Robert Montgomery ; from Rus- 
kin (to whom Mr. Linton sold Brantwood) to 
Oeorge Francis Train, whom he once saw mak- 
ing a speech in support of his self-imposed 
Presidential candidacy. Train, he adds, spoke 
fluently and well, though with not much in his 
words. 

" During his speech he went to one end of the plat- 
form, and, taking hold of his nose with one hand, ran 
across the platform to the other end, saying: 'Let my 
nose alone ! ' ' That,' he added, 'is the Democratic party ! ' 
Then, taking his nose with the other hand, he ran back: 
' You, too, let my nose alone ! That is the Republican 
party. I don't mean to be led by the nose by either.' " 

Prominent on the list of Mr. Linton's ac- 
quaintances are Dickens, Landor,Hood, Brown- 
ing, Leech, Rossetti, Mazzini, Cruikshank, 
Hay don, Emerson, Dr. Holmes, Longfellow, 
and others ; and his impressions of these, where 
he chooses to give them, are given with a can- 
dor and an independence of conventional esti- 
mates that is refreshing. Touching Dickens, 
whose " real vocation was as an actor of low 
comedy," who " was not the gentleman," and 
who had " no soul of nobility in him," he quotes 
the following story : 

" When he and Wilkie Collins and Wills (the editor 
of ' Household Words ') went out, taking Dickens's doc- 
tor with them, to eat ' the most expensive dinner they 
<sould get,' it was an action that marked the Amphitryon 
of the feast, if not the others also. It is an unpleasant 
anecdote, but it was told me by the doctor himself, who 
had to prescribe for all three next day." 

It is certainly not a little amusing to think of 
this spiteful satirist of American gluttony and 
neglect of table proprieties thus deliberately 
setting out to gorge himself to the point of 
apoplexy, and taking his doctor along with him 
as a precautionary measure. 

Landor, Mr. Linton never saw, though he 
corresponded with him, and once received, 
through Browning, a dubious token of his re- 
gard in the shape of a picture " supposed to be 
by Michael Angelo." The gift seems to have 
done little more credit to the donor's heart than 
to his connoisseurship : 

" Landor at one time had a large collection of pic- 
tures, supposed to be genuine, but seldom if ever of 
any worth. This ' Angelo ' might be of that sort. I 
called on Browning to look at and to speak about the 
picture. It was a ' Last Judgment,' a poor and very 



unpleasant composition, too large and too unpleasant to 
be hung in a private house, a gift as of a white elephant, 
neither to be accepted nor refused. I got out of the 
difficulty by Browning telling me that the old man had 
no right to give it, as all his ' belongings ' really belonged 
to his brother, Robert Landor, on whom Walter Savage 
was living. So Browning took charge of the elephant 
and relieved me." 

Mr. Linton recalls George Cruikshank as 
" a well-built, good-looking, good-natured man, 
a bluff speaker who could call a spade a spade." 
His bump of reverence must have been poorly 
developed ; for the author remembers him ex- 
claiming, with some impiety, in regard to a 
publisher who had misquoted him in a dispute 
over the price of some work, " My dear sir, the 
publisher is a liar ! " Cruikshank, however, 
seems to have lived, and even flourished, for 
some years after this incident. Speaking of 
Leech, Mr. Linton tells the story of the public 
castigation of one Bernard Gregory, a black- 
guard journalist turned actor, at the hands of 
those he had pilloried in his scandal-mongering 
sheet, " The Satirist." 

" On a certain morning London streets were pla- 
carded with the following notice: 'Gentlemen of Lon- 
don ! Mr. Bernard Gregory, the editor of the " Sat- 
irist," will appear to-night at Covent-Garden Theatre, 
in the character of Hamlet.' The placard had been 
put out by the ' Punch ' contributors, the object suffi- 
ciently obvious: to oppose Gregory, who was notori- 
ous as a rascally blackmailer. John Leech called on 
me in the morning to tell me of their purpose and to 
ask me to go. Of course I went, and took a friend with 
me; and we got forward seats in the pit. Looking 
round I saw a lot of rough fellows who, I concluded, 
were hired as claquers for Gregory, and was not with- 
out fears of a fierce conflict. The curtain drew up, and 
the action of the play began in all serenity ; but so soon 
as Hamlet appeared, an outcry, a burst of execration, 
rose so suddenly, and was so general, that one saw at 
once no opposition could make head against it. Hisses 
and hootings, cries of ' Off ! Off ! Blackguard ! Scoun- 
drel ! ' and the like, were hurled at the actor; and the 
whole performance was stopped. Nothing was thrown 
except the storm of vociferation. Gregory faced it 
awhile, undauntedly impudent, then tried to make his 
voice heard in protest, but it was drowned in the roar 
of indignation. ... At length he gave in, and as the 
curtain came down he seemed to cower and crouch be- 
neath. Then the manager came forward to withdraw 
the piece, and the conspirators went out to moisten their 
parched throats. Leech was hoarse for days." 

An amusing afterpiece to this tragi-comedy 
was the appearance of the noted pugilist, Jem 
Mace, as a witness in the suit for conspiracy 
brought by Gregory against the Duke of Bruns- 
wick, who, having been grossly assailed in 
" The Satirist," took a leading part in the riot. 
Mace, too, had been present and prominently 
active. 

" He did not deny the part he had taken, but denied

having been hired for the conspiracy. He was asked: 
' What made you active in such a matter ? what inter- 
est had you in it ? ' His interest, he replied, in public 
morality; he could not help protesting against such a 
man disgracing the stage or words to that effect. The 
judge complimented him, and said he was glad to find 
so much public spirit in the parish in which he had his 
own residence." 

It is to be regretted that the tide of journalistic 
scurrility has even in England since risen to 
such a point that even the professional prow- 
ess of the high-minded Mr. Mace would be as 
the broom of Mrs. Partington to the Atlantic 
against it. 

Hastily running over a few of Mr. Linton's 
briefer characterizations, we find Bronson Al- 
cott set down as " a strange, mystical, gentle 
old philosopher, very gracious, very wordy, 
rather incomprehensible "; Walt Whitman as 
" a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, a 
true poet who could not write poetry, much of 
wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form, 
perhaps ^s fatal a mistake in a poet as in a 
painter "; Mme. Blavatsky as " a fat, vulgar- 
looking woman, not, one could not help think- 
ing, at all likely to be mistaken for a prophet- 
ess, no sibyl, but a veritable old witch, with 
nothing venerable about her "; Mr. Stoddard 
as " the highest poetic genius now living in 
America "; Mr. Swinburne (in 1861) as " a 
young man looking like a boy, and with a boy- 
ish manner, jumping about as he became ex- 
cited in speaking, yet interesting and attract- 
ive "; Place, the " Westminster tailor," as a 
"fierce Malthusian with a large family"; Ros- 
setti as " an Italian of the time of the Medici, 
not without thoughts and superstitions of that 
period, a man of genius both in art and liter- 
ature, one, however, hindering the other, the 
literary predominating, and by which he will 
be best recollected "; and Harriet Martineau 
as " a good-looking, interesting old lady, very 
deaf, but cheerful and eager for news, which 
she did not always catch correctly." Of Miss 
Martineau Mr. Linton adds : 

" With all her manly self-dependence and strict inten- 
tional honesty, with all her credit for practical common 
sense, she was as much a poet as her brother, the Rev. 
James; a romancer even in the region of economical 
facts, even in those hard ' Poor Law Tales,' when under 
Lord Brougham she was preparing to prove the neces- 
sity for the Poor Law Amendment Act, that crowning 
harshness of Whig rule. She has never had justice done 
to her on this ground of romance." 

In his chapter on American poets Mr. Lin- 
ton quotes a letter from Whittier, written in 
reply to his request for the exact date of the 
latter's birth, to which we beg to call the at- 



tention of the poet's excellent biographer, Mr. 
Pickard. Mr. Pickard gives the date as " the 
17th of December, 1807 "; but we find Whit- 
tier writing : " My birthday was the very last of 
the year 1807." 

Mr. Linton's book is, as we have tried to 
show, lively, pleasantly discursive, and strongly 
individual in tone, its main fault being an oc- 
casional tendency to run reminiscence into a 
mere list of notable names. The pages on the 
Chartist agitation, its aims, its incidents, and 
its heroes, are of stable interest. Materially, the 
volume is a tasteful one ; and there is a fine 
portrait of the author, showing a most kindly 
and venerable face truly " a face like a bene- 
diction." E. G. J. 



THE WAY OF THE GODS IN JAPAN.* 

To an audience of Athenians on Mars' Hill, 
Paul said : " Ye men of Athens, I perceive 
that in all things ye are altogether supersti- 
tious." One might likewise stand before an 
audience of Japanese and say : " Ye men of 
Nippon, I perceive that in all things ye are alto- 
gether superstitious." For most faithfully and 
devoutly do the mass of the Japanese worship 
their innumerable deities, estimated with the 
indefinite expression, " eighty myriads." And 
the relation between men and gods there is so 
familiar that the former, when calling the lat- 
ter to receive homage and hear prayer, use the 
same method, the clapping of the hands, that 
is employed in summoning servants. Thus, in 
Japan, deities are treated like domestics ; in 
America, domestics conduct themselves as if 
they were deities ! And these Japanese gods 
are so numerous, so ubiquitous, and so demo- 
cratic, that Mr. Percival Lowell, in his new 
book on " Occult Japan," is " tempted to in- 
clude them in the census, and to consider the 
population of Japan as composed of natives, 
globe-trotters, and gods." 

It was in an unexpected and strange way that 
Mr. Lowell himself, though a Western " bar- 
barian," got into the presence of the gods, and, 
after that introduction, was enabled to culti- 
vate their acquaintance. He was ascending, 
for recreation, a sacred mount, named Ontake, 
when he fell in with three pilgrims, and became 
an uninvited spectator of a series of esoteric rites 
of divine incarnation. This interesting revela- 
tion led him into further investigation, and re-

Study of Japanese Personality and Possession. By Percival

suited in a series of papers on " Esoteric Shinto," 
read before the Asiatic Society of Japan and 
published in the " Transactions " of that body. 
These papers, revised, together with about a 
hundred additional pages and four illustrations, 
make up " Occult Japan," which is a very in- 
teresting and valuable contribution to the study 
of folk-lore, anthropology, and comparative re- 
ligion. 

This book contains a minute description of 
several " miracles," such as " the ordeal of boil- 
ing water," " walking bare-foot over a bed of 
live coals," "climbing a ladder of sword-blades," 
" the descent of the thunder-god " into a kettle 
of boiling rice, "calling down fire from heaven " 
to light the tobacco in a pipe, etc. The last 
two were absolute " fakes "; but the first three 
were actually performed in Mr. Lowell's pres- 
ence. The theory of the Japanese with refer- 
ence to miracles is that they can be performed 
only by those who are absolutely pure in body 
and heart, and who, to obtain that purity, have 
gone through with certain sacred rites. But 
that theory was demolished when Mr. Lowell's 
" boy " suddenly jumped out of the audience 
and climbed the ladder of sword-blades. The 
successful performance of these miracles is as- 
cribed by Mr. Lowell to two things " a thicker 
skin in the priests [the performers] and a 
thicker skull in the people." And it seems 
quite probable that " doubtless credulity is the 
mother of miracles, but doubtless, also, with 
the far eastern family of them, a pachyderma- 
tous sole step-fathers the process. For most 
of them are questions of cuticle." 

From the miracle of walking barefoot on live 
coals an interesting "moral " has been evolved, 
and is thus explained by the high priest : 

" The object of the rite is that the populace may see 
that the god when duly besought can take away the 
burning spirit of fire while permitting the body of it to 
remain. For so can he do with the hearts of men; the 
bad spirit may be driven out and the good put in its 
place while still the man continues to exist." 

About one-third of the book is given up to 
the subject of " incarnations," or " possession 
by the gods." In order to enjoy a divine visit, 
human beings must be pure ; and the two chief 
exercises that induce purity are washings and 
fasting, " ablution and abstinence." There are 
three forms in accordance with which a relig- 
ious trance is brought on ; the elaborate Rybbu 
ceremony, employed by those who have fol- 
lowed that confused mixture of Buddhism and 
Shinto ; the pure Buddhist ceremony, which is 
peculiar in that " the god shows a preference 



for feminine lips "; and the pure Shinto cere- 
mony, which is plain and simple, and lacks the 
excessive ritual of the other two. The details 
of all these forms are fully described, and a 
very careful comparison is made by Mr. Lowell. 
It is impossible to summarize this portion of his 
book, which must be read in toto ; but it is pos- 
sible to quote a characteristic passage or two : 

" It [the pure Shinto ceremony] is nothing more or 
less than a divine banquet, with the god himself for an 
after-dinner speaker. The dinner is all-essential to the 
affair, as it is to all Shinto rites. For the Shinto prac- 
tice of dining its deities is not confined to the ceremony 
of possession. Wherever the gods are invoked, for any 
cause whatsoever, they are induced to descend by the 
prospect of a dinner. A repast stands perpetually pre- 
pared on all Shinto altars ; shrines being, to put it irrev- 
erently, free-lunch counters for deity, while every Shinto 
service is but a special banquet given some particular 
god. One comes to conceive of a Shinto god's life as 
one continuous round of dining out. To induce an after- 
dinner mood in a god whom one wishes to propitiate is 
doubtless judicious." 

" But such [shams] are easily exploded. An unex- 
pected pin in a tender part of the possessed's body 
instantly does the business. For a god is sublimely su- 
perior to being made a pin-cushion of, while a mere man 
invariably objects to it." 

A chapter is devoted to pilgrimages and pil- 
grim clubs. The former are called " peripa- 
tetic picnic parties, faintly flavored with piety "; 
and yet, with reference to Shinto, are " more 
than foot-notes to its creed." The pilgrim clubs 
are " not an imported institution, but a custom 
indigenous to Japan "; they contain generally 
a membership of from one hundred to five hun- 
dred persons, while the largest club has about 
twelve thousand members. These clubs are 
regularly officered and carefully managed ; and 
they send on the annual pilgrimages represen- 
tatives chosen by lot. The pilgrimage to Ise, 
where " there is nothing to see, and they won't 
let you see it," is made in spring, " when the 
cherries blow "; other pilgrimages are made in 
midsummer ; and at both seasons pilgrims and 
pilgrim clubs have " the right of way." 

In the last hundred pages of the book is given 
a metaphysical discussion of hypnotism, trances, 
etc., with special reference to " things Japanese." 
There is an analysis of certain Japanese mental 
characteristics, such as lack of originality, un- 
common imitativeness, absence of reasoning, 
general incapacity for abstract ideas, and de- 
corous demeanor. There is also an application 
of the thought of the caviller who changed 
Pope's well-known verse into the statement 

" An honest god 's the noblest work of man." 

For Mr. Lowell says of people's gods : 

" In their characters generally you shall see reflected 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



47 



the race characteristics. In Japan the gods are emi- 
nently Japanese. They are dignified, artistic, simple 
souls, of the most exceptional deportment. Their life 
is made up of one long chain of ornamental, if some- 
what conventional, moments." 

And, of course, the man who wrote " The Soul 
of the Far East " to prove that the Japanese, 
Chinese, and Koreans have no " soul," no per- 
sonality, no individuality, finds in these relig- 
ious trances additional proof of that idea, and 
also of " a curiously conceived impersonal kind 
of deity." 

En passant, Mr. Lowell gives the following 
opinion of Buddhism : 

" Emotionally its tenets do not at bottom satisfy us 
occidentals, flirt with them as we may. Passivity is not 
our passion, preach it as we are prone to do each to his 
neighbor. Scientifically, pessimism is foolishness, and 
impersonality a stage in development from which we 
are emerging, not one into which we shall ever relapse. 
As a dogma it is unfortunate, doing its devotee in the 
deeper sense no good, but it becomes positively faulty 
when it leads to practical ignoring of the mine and 
thine, and does other people harm." 

Having recently been treated to Mr. Hearn's 
analysis of Shinto, we are delighted to have Mr. 
Lowell give his idea of what Shinto is : 

" To foreign students . . . Shinto has seemed little 
better than the ghost of a belief, far too insubstantial 
a body of faith to hold a heart. To ticket its gods and 
pigeon-hole its folk-lore has appeared to be the end of 
a study of its cult." 

" Shinto is the Japanese conception of the cosmos. 
It is a combination of the worship of nature and of their 
own ancestors. . . . To the Japanese eye, the universe 
itself took on the paternal look. Awe of their parents, 
which these people could comprehend, lent explanation 
to dread of nature, which they could not. Quite co- 
gently, to their minds, the thunder and the typhoon, the 
sunshine and the earthquake, were the work not only 
of anthropomorphic beings, but of beings ancestrally 
related to themselves. In short, Shinto ... is simply 
the patriarchal principle projected without perspective 
into the past, dilating with distance into deity." [Rather 
excessively alliterative ! ] 

" Shinto is thus an adoration of family wraiths, or of 
imputed family wraiths; imaginaries of the first and 
the second order in the analysis of the universe." 

" Shinto is so Japanese it will not down. It is the 
faith of these people's birthright, not of their adoption. 
Its folk-lore is what they learned at the knee of the 
race-mother, not what they were taught from abroad. 
Buddhist they are by virtue of belief; Shinto by virtue 
of being."

EARLY LONDON THEATRES.* 



Mr. T. Fairman Ordish's volume on " Early 
London Theatres " purports to be a " theatrical 
history," a study of playhouses rather than 
plays, except where the latter are found to throw 
some fresh light on the evolution of the stage and 
the appurtenances. In spite of the author's anti- 
quarian professions, there is a gratuitous and 
delightful strand of literary allusion running 
through the book, finally widening and expand- 
ing into a discussion of Henslowe's Diary, dis- 
tinguished autographs, Ben Jonson's duel and 
the various appearances of his and Shake- 
speare's plays, all of which is, to the average 
mind, more interesting than the bulk of the 
volume, and, indeed, is of a certain importance 
in establishing the topographical and archae- 
ological points in view. " Rare old Ben " comes 
in edgewise, with a frequency that needs, per- 
haps, no excuse when it is recalled how he bullies 
posterity for recognition. Though a tolerably 
good biography of him could be picked up along 
the way, there are other obiter dicta which are 
tantalizingly brief. Mr. Ordish has a way of 
postponing many elusive matters till the " end 
of the chapter," or " the second volume " 
which, we hasten to say, will treat more espe- 
cially of the Shakespearian theatres, Black- 
friars and The Globe. The omission of these 
for the present is justified by the fact that the 
earliest playhouses were erected outside the 
town " in the fields," owing to the " official 
war " that was waged against them as " simi- 
naries of impiety." 

After describing the scaffolds and stages 
made in the streets for the representations of 
plays, before theatres were constructed, and ad- 
vancing the theory that the amphitheatres south 
of London and in Cornwall, where national 
sports and pastimes were cultivated, had more 
effect in determining the configuration of the 
early British theatre than did the arrangement 
of churches and their much-exploited miracle- 
plays and moralities, Mr. Ordish considers in 
seven chapters The Theatre, the first London 
playhouse, where Marlowe's " Faustus " and 
the old pre - Shakespearian "Hamlet" were 
given ; The Curtain, which had the longest 
existence of all the London playhouses, and was 
associated, probably, with the first " Romeo " 
and " Every Man in his Humour "; the Sur- 
rey side, with its Tabard Inn and residences

of actors ; the amphitheatres with movable 
stages and bear-baitings (a Spanish ambassa- 
dor's graphic description, p. 131); the New- 
ington Butts, with its "unrecorded dramatic 
history," The Rose, Hope Theatre, Paris Gar- 
den, and The Swan. The last chapter is a 
decided contribution to antiquarian research. 
As the author claims, " the upshot is practi- 
cally to rescue from oblivion another of the old 
playhouses." The volume is replete with maps, 
illustrations, and reproductions of old prints ; 
and it is agreeably indexed. Abundant ac- 
knowledgments are made to the previous in- 
vestigations of Rendle and Halliwell-Phillipps. 

A glance through these chapters reveals anew 
how essential was the theatre to the social de- 
velopment of England. Only in the churches 
and in the playhouses did all sections of Eliz- 
abethan society meet ; and Sunday was the day 
set apart for the one as for the other, indeed, 
bear-baitings occurred regularly "on the Son- 
dayes in the afternone after divine service." 
"The people had become accustomed to the 
stimulus and pleasure of dramatic representa- 
tions; and not the long tramp to Finsbury 
Fields, not the roughness displayed by the 
groundlings nor the fact that idle and disso- 
lute characters inevitably haunted the play- 
house, nor even the real and terrible danger of 
the plague, could turn the Elizabethan play- 
goer from the pastime he loved." The city 
fathers little realized that the theatre was the 
outcome of the public sports which had been 
cultivated under their sanction and encourage- 
ment for many generations. Their repressive 
measures are less interesting to read about, be- 
cause less picturesque, than the diatribes of the 
clergy of the period. The offensive vituper- 
ation thrown off in the white heat of Puritan 
indignation, the inflated conviction of the pul- 
pit that " the door of a play-house was equiv- 
alent to hell-mouth," is pictured in the racy 
sermonic extracts collated by Mr. Ordish, and 
furnishes a convenient connecting link between 
Tertullian and Dr. Herrick Johnson. 

The lover of theatrical gossip will here find 
many trivial but spicy incidents tucked away 
amid much learning. He will read, with a mod- 
ern zest which finally erases the gap of three 
hundred years, that " apparently such a thing as 
a poorhouse was unknown at the first London 
theatre; and assuredly the prices were pop- 
ular "; that Nash's " Pierce Penilesse " was 
witnessed by " ten thousand spectators at 
least"; that The Theatre was finally taken down 
piece by piece and carried bodily to Bankside, 



where "with the sayd timber and wood" was 
erected the famous Globe. He will follow the 
ancient rivalries between The Theatre and The 
Curtain, The Globe and The Rose, as if he 
knew the several managers. He will finger 
the copper lace charged to the actors on Hens- 
lowe's books. He will receive instructive hints 
as to certain scenes from Shakespeare, as 
when he reads : " You may be sure the wrest- 
ling match in 'As You Like It' was no child's 
play or stage business, but was watched with 
critical attention ; for it was an element brought 
into the play from the life of the people. . . . 
The existence of the playhouse implied a more 
highly organized celebration of the national 
plays and games." Thus the volume possesses 
an interest to the general reader as well as to 
the antiquarian. Its style is readable and pains- 
taking. It will doubtless be an authoritative 
reference-book on the subject of London play- 

houses ' G. M. HYDE. 



BOPES'S HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR.* 



Mr. Ropes has undertaken his " Story of the 
Civil War " in the spirit of the true historian. 
His plan, as stated by himself, is "to write of 
the subjects treated from the standpoint of each 
of the contending parties." " In my judg- 
ment," he adds, " the war should not be so de- 
picted as to imply that the North and the South 
differed and quarreled about the same things. 
This was not the fact. The questions presented 
to the men of the North were not the same as 
those with which their Southern contemporaries 
had to deal." Whether or not we fully agree with 
this last statement, it is evident that this book 
is not written in the interest of either combatant 
or of any theory. A vast mass of material for 
the history of the war has been contributed in 
the form of personal experiences and partisan 
accounts. We are now far enough away from 
the passions of the time to allow both scholarly 
writing and unprejudiced reading about the 
great struggle. 

Though claiming to be simply a narrative of 
the military events of the war, this first volume, 
at least, is largely taken up with a description 
of the political situation in 1860 and 1861, and 
the inter-relations of politics and the military 
plans and operations. Mr. Ropes first contrasts

the views of the sections as to the relation of the 
States and the Nation. The South claimed and 
believed that the United States was not a single 
nation, but a collection of nations, united by a 
treaty known as the Constitution. Though the 
question has been settled now adversely to this 
position, it was honestly maintained by the vast 
majority of the men of the South, and formed 
the basis of their political thought and action ; 
from it the right of Secession naturally fol- 
lowed. The North as honestly believed that 
the United States, whatever they may have 
been in 1789, constituted but one nation in 
1861, and so denied the right of Secession as 
destructive of the nation they loved. These 
differences were irreconcilable. The Southern- 
ers were fighting for the integrity of their na- 
tions against ruthless Northern aggression ; the 
Northerners fought to preserve the integrity of 
the nation they loved. The conflict was such 
as to kindle the patriotic feelings of both the 
contending parties. And though the North 
considered the war a Rebellion, it was in fact 
a war between nations, a war of conquest, and 
was so waged. It was not a rising for the re- 
dress of grievances, with two parties corre- 
sponding to the Patriots and the Loyalists of 
the Revolution ; it was substantially a unani- 
mous rising in behalf of their imperilled na- 
tions, and as such was a patriotic war. This 
may be a rather strong putting of the actual 
case, yet there is enough foundation for it to 
free from the moral guilt of treason those who 
resigned from the Federal service to go with 
their States. It was their duty to go with their 
States, if they believed their allegiance to be- 
long there first ; and the treatment which the 
Southern leaders received, whether as prison- 
ers or after their defeat, corresponded with this 
view. 

The question of the Southern forts is taken 
up in the second chapter ; and here, as on the 
general question of the War, Mr. Ropes de- 
clares that the positions of the parties were so 
utterly opposed that all criticism of one from 
the standpoint of the other is illegitimate and 
valueless. What the positions were can be 
readily inferred from the general theories above 
noted. But in any case the seizure was really 
an act of war which was thus begun before 
any hostile act had been committed by the na- 
tional government and justifiable only as a 
necessity in view of impending war. In dis- 
cussing the reinforcement of Fort Sumter, Mr. 
Ropes seems to criticize rather harshly Major 
Anderson's failure to ask for more troops, in 



view of the hostile preparations making against 
the fort by South Carolina, and especially 
because he used the words " my policy " in 
speaking of his disinclination to precipitate the 
outbreak of open hostilities. He gave the gov- 
ernment full information as to his situation ; he 
had been given full discretion ; if the govern- 
ment had wished to press matters to a conclu- 
sion, it was open to it to do so. The respon- 
sibility should and does rest upon the govern- 
ment at the centre, where broad plans were to 
be matured, rather than on a subordinate offi- 
cer immured within the narrow walls of a fort- 
ress. Besides, Mr. Ropes acknowledges that 
the outcome was better, all responsibility for 
the outbreak being thrown upon the South, and 
in such a way as to evoke a most astonishing 
outburst of patriotic enthusiasm throughout the 
North when Sumter fell. 

One notes with interest, and with a query, 
the author's statement that the men of the 
South had greater aptitude for war than their 
opponents. They loved it, and entered upon 
it with the enthusiasm that brings success. 
To the men of the North, on the other hand, 
war was wholly distasteful ; they went into it 
wholly from a sense of duty, but with a grim 
determination to win, and to punish those who 
were to blame for it. The several advantages 
and disadvantages of the respective sections are 
clearly described. 

The chapter on the Battle of Bull Run is 
perhaps the best in the book. Here the au- 
thor's peculiar skill as a military historian and 
critic shows itself. Without loading his de- 
scription with detail, he has clearly presented 
the plans of the commanders, the disposition of 
the respective forces, and the movement of the 
battle, in a masterly way ; and his criticisms 
seem just. The defeat of the Northern forces 
he considers a deserved punishment for the 
folly of the administration in forcing an ag- 
gressive battle with raw levies, when nothing 
of permanent importance was to be gained by 
victory. 

We pass over the discussion of plans and 
preparations in East and West, to note Mr. 
Ropes's estimates of some of the prominent 
characters of the war. General Buell he con- 
siders the ablest soldier by far that the period 
produced, equal to McClellan as an organizer 
and disciplinarian, far superior " in military 
sagacity, in clear and unprejudiced vision, and 
in decision of character." Buell's comprehen- 
sive plan of operations was rejected by Lincoln 
and McClellan on one side and Halleck on the 



50

other, only to be followed at last when its wis- 
dom had been proved by the failure of the rival 
plans. Only a part of McClellan's melancholy 
career belongs to the period covered by this 
volume, but the great change from unbounded 
popularity and confidence to distrust and dis- 
satisfaction appears long before the campaign 
of 1862 is entered upon. Mr. Ropes does not 
blame McClellan for deferring extensive oper- 
ations against the enemy until spring, for he 
considers the army unready for a great aggres- 
sive campaign without long drill and the devel- 
opment of a true military spirit. But he does 
blame him for his neglect of opportunities for 
easily recovering the confidence of the country 
and improving the spirit of his troops, for his 
indecision and lack of enterprise, for his flat dis- 
obedience of orders in leaving Washington insuf- 
ficiently protected when he transferred his army 
to the Peninsula, and especially for his unfortun- 
ate tendency to be governed by his imagination, 
which was uncommonly active, rather than by 
common sense. Referring to his insistence 
upon Buell's movement into East Tennessee 
against disadvantages amounting almost to im- 
possibilities, the author says : 

" Nothing shows more clearly the imaginative side of 
McClellan's mind, and his absolute inability to take any 
interest in or bestow any careful thought upon any sub- 
ject that did not appeal to his imagination, than this 
curious letter. . . . But it is plain that none of these 
things [the difficulties] even entered the mind of Gen- 
eral McClellan. His head was full of his own campaign 
in Virginia, and nothing interested him that was not, 
or might not be supposed in some way to be, related to 
his own operations there. And, as a sort of justification 
for his decision, he had conjured up before his imagin- 
ation a vision of an eager and grateful population, in 
half of the States of the Confederacy, flocking to the 
Union standard as soon as it should be unfurled on the 
mountains of East Tennessee, and of ' immense results ' 
therefrom arising." 

And elsewhere he says : 

" McClellan's imagination was, in fact, always carry- 
ing him away from the facts before him, always induc- 
ing him to see things in distorted shapes and some- 
times, as we shall see later, impelling him to do things 
which he would not have done had he from the first 
resolutely determined never to let himself be ruled by 
his fancies and his prejudices." 

Mr. Ropes's treatment of President Lincoln 
is unsympathetic, and, perhaps unconsciously, 
depreciatory. " Puerile impatience," " singu- 
lar orders," " this extraordinary production," 
" this is really ludicrous in its minimizing of the 
facts of the situation [of his proclamation after 
the fall of Fort Sumter]," "Mr. Lincoln's 
serious defects as an administrator, as a man 
of affairs," "futile and useless suggestions," 



" lack of confidence and of ordinary courtesy," 
such are the terms in which he allows him- 
self to speak of the President and his acts, 
while speaking admiringly only of his political 
sagacity. The facts he himself presents do not 
seem to warrant the expressions used ; while 
the full history of the times, as it is disclosed, 
only increases our admiration for him who bore 
the crushing burden of the government, and 
places him higher upon the world's calendar 
of really great men. 

We have reason to be grateful to Mr. Ropes 
for this work, and shall look for the remaining 
volumes with keen expectation. It is in the 
best sense popular, being clear, untechnical, 
free from confusing details, and at the same 
time based on ample research and written in a 
judicial spirit.

observation and kindly satire, in the unwonted fin- 
ish of its style and the delicacy of its characteriza- 
tion, best of all, in its persistent exaltation of cer- 
tain old-fashioned ideals of conduct and conceptions 
of life that are apt to get crowded below the hori- 
zon of such men of the world as Mr. Warner. This 
is the eternal difficulty in fiction. The young writer 
may have the fine enthusiasms and the first literary 
instincts, but he is only beginning his acquaintance 
with life, and he cannot describe it with force and 
discernment. On the other hand, the writer who 
knocks about in the world rarely escapes the con- 
tagion of its slow stain, and most often comes to 
know life only at the expense of the freshness of 
his ideals. It was because Mr. Warner, in his first 
attempt at extended fiction-writing, seemed to show 
that it was possible to avoid impalement upon the 
horn of this dilemma, to prove that the mellow- 
ness of experience might be gained without loss of 
faith in the nobler human impulses, it was for these 
reasons that the story was notable. We are justi- 
fied in making these remarks about an old book in 
a review of " Recent Fiction " for the simple reason 
that they are quite as applicable to one of the new- 
est of novels to " The Golden House," which is, 
in fact, a continuation of the story published five 
years ago. Here is traced for us the career of Hen- 
derson from his second marriage to his death. 
Wealthier and wealthier he grows, and with each 
step gained recedes farther and farther from the 
reach of our sympathies. No one recognizes better 
than himself the uselessness and hopelessness of the 
whole struggle, but he cannot shape his character 
anew. The fierce excitement of the earlier stages 
in his career of worldly success has long since sub- 
sided, and he continues to amass wealth only by a 
sort of dull instinct, and because there is nothing 
else in the world for him to do. Finally, death 
strikes him unexpectedly, and he passes from the 
scene unmourned, save by those whose selfish inter- 
ests are jeopardized by his undiscounted taking-off. 
But the sympathy that we cannot feel for Hender- 
son finds among the other characters ample scope 
for action. There are the self-sacrificing workers 
among the slums for Mr. Warner makes effective 
use of the contrast between the New York of fash- 
ion and frivolity and the New York of toil and de- 
gradation and there is the heroine of the story, 
Edith Delancey, who keeps her soul sweet and pure 
amidst the enervating and corrupting influences of 
her environment, and whose love finally prevails to 
save her husband's weaker soul from ruin. Mr. 
Warner's style is at its mellowest and best in this 
novel. How good it is, and how delicately it can 
satirize the foibles of the society that its master has 
had so much practice in delineating, must be illus- 
trated by one short extract. 

" Edith's day had been as busy as Jack's, notwith- 
standing she had put aside several things that demanded 
her attention. She denied herself the morning attend- 
ance on the Literature Class that was raking over the 
eighteenth century. This week Swift was to be ar- 



raigned. The last time when Edith was present it was 
Steele. The judgment, on the whole, had been favor- 
able, and there had been a little stir of tenderness among 
the bonnets over Thackeray's comments on the Christian 
soldier. It seemed to bring him near to them. ' Poor Dick 
Steele,' said the essayist. Edith declared afterwards 
that the large woman who sat next to her, Mrs. Jerry 
Hollowell, whispered to her that she always thought his 
name was Bessemer; but this was, no doubt, a pleas- 
antry. It was a beautiful essay, and so stimulating ! 
And then there was bouillon, and time to look about at 
the toilets. Poor Steele, it would have cheered his life 
to know that a century after his death so many beauti- 
ful women, exquisitely dressed, would have been con- 
cerning themselves about him. The function lasted two 
hours. Edith made a little calculation. In five min- 
utes she could have got from the encyclopaedia all the 
facts in the essay, and while her maid was doing her 
hair she could have read five times as much of Steele 
as the essayist read. And, somehow, she was not stim- 
ulated, for the impression seemed to prevail that now 
Steele was disposed of. And she had her doubts whether 
literature would, after all, prove to be a permanent so- 
cial distraction. But Edith may have been too severe 
in her judgment. There was probably not a woman in 
the class that day who did not go away with the knowl- 
edge that Steele was an author, and that he lived in the 
eighteenth century. The hope of the country is in the 
diffusion of knowledge." 

The name of Thackeray occurs in the above extract ; 
let us take the hint, and say at once that Thackeray 
himself could not have done . this particular thing 
any better than Mr. Warner has done it. A final 
word must be given to Mr. W. T. Smedley's illus- 
trations, which are conspicuously excellent, both for 
drawing and for sympathy. Writer and artist would 
appear to have seen the same things with the same 
eyes, so complete is the understanding between them. 

It is a pleasure to welcome Mr. Cable the novel- 
ist once more, for reasons both positive and negative. 
The positive reason is, of course, that Mr. Cable is 
one of the half dozen best writers of fiction that 
America has produced ; the negative reason is that 
in re-welcoming the novelist we may hope to have 
seen the last of the doctrinaire writer upon the great 
Race Question of the New South. Let Mr. Cable 
incorporate that question into his novels as much as 
he will (and he has made considerable use of it in the 
present instance), but he will do well to avoid it as a 
subject for further serious discussion. " John March, 
Southerner " is the story of a young man who was 
born in the late fifties, and who thus grew up to 
manhood during the period of reconstruction. We 
first meet him as a child at the time of Lee's sur- 
render, and we part with him in early manhood, a 
citizen of the New South of our own days. This 
scheme enables the writer to place before our eyes 
a series of graphic pictures, enlivened by humor, 
pathos, and dramatic episode, of the typical phases 
in the emergence of the new regime from the old. 
There is first the blank despair of defeat, then the 
slowly reawakening will, then the advent of the 
carpet-bagger and the hideous period of negro mis- 
rule ; last of all, there is the acceptance of the new

conditions, the recognition by the superior race of 
its responsibilities accompanied by the reassertion 
of its intelligence, and the effort to develope the 
material resources of a land lagging half a century 
behind the rest of civilization. This is the series 
of pictures that Mr. Cable has drawn for us, and 
illustrated by types of character appropriate to the 
scene. It is true that the pictures are too often 
mere flash-light photographs, which leave us be- 
wildered in the endeavor to connect them in logical 
sequence, and that the broad general outlines of the 
characters are not readily decipherable ; but the book 
contains such a wealth of happily conceived detail, 
and so hurries us on from one pleasant surprise to 
another, that we are not disposed to criticize very 
harshly its failure to impress the reader as a har- 
monious and well -cemented whole. Besides, all 
readers of Mr. Cable's other novels know that this 
is precisely the failure most characteristic of their 
author. 

" When All the Woods Are Green " is a sweet 
and wholesome story of love and adventure in the 
forests of Eastern Canada. Three weeks of camp- 
ing and salmon-fishing, enjoyed by a family party 
on the one hand, and an adventitious young man on 
the other, furnish the sufficient setting for this tale. 
It need hardly be added that the family of campers 
provides a suitable heroine, and that the young man 
in question becomes less and less adventitious as 
the story runs on. The element of adventure is 
supplied, first by an opportune bear, and later by 
an attempt at murder on the part of one of the 
natives. But neither the bear nor the native is per- 
mitted to introduce an element of tragedy into the 
situation, although the latter comes dangerously 
near doing so. It may be objected that too book- 
ish a character is often given to the conversation, 
and occasional verbal infelicities, such as the objec- 
tionable preposition " onto " and the equally objec- 
tionable adverb " illy," may be pointed out. But 
these are trifling defects in a narrative which is 
charmingly set forth as a whole, and which displays 
remarkable powers of quiet incisive characterization. 
There is an even excellence about this, as about all 
of Dr. Mitchell's literary work, which makes minute 
criticism captious, and which, combined with light- 
ness of touch, and sympathetic handling of the ma- 
terial, makes us feel that we are in good company, 
and wish that the acquaintance might be prolonged. 

When the Great American Novel shall have been 
born and we hope some day to chronicle that 
happy occurrence it will become interesting to 
trace its spiritual genesis, not merely in the mind 
and heart of its creator, but in the antecedent liter- 
ature which shall have been tending toward so great 
a consummation. Many earlier attempts, to our 
present purblind vision seemingly abortive, will then 
be seen to have contained within themselves the 
germ of the flower so long hoped for, to have dis- 
played flashes of insight into the essential nature of 
the problem so long unsolved. If, then, some student 



of comparative literary embryology shall chance to 
exhume from the mould of the year now just ended 
a novel called "The Honorable Peter Stirling," the 
work of Mr. Paul Leicester Ford, we fancy that he 
will recognize it as having been one of the precur- 
sors of the final triumph, as having had some dim 
glimpses, at least, of the aim that the Great Amer- 
ican Novelist is bound to have in view. For that 
aim must be, must it not ? to plunge into the heart 
of American life, to converge upon some focal sit- 
uation the various streams of social energy that per- 
form the functions of the organism. It will not be 
easy to determine exactly what elements should con- 
tribute to such a synthesis, but it may be confidently 
asserted, at least, that the political element cannot 
be spared. For good or for evil we possess as a 
nation the political instinct as few nations have ever 
possessed it. Now Mr. Ford has seized upon this 
truth, and has made politics the mainspring of his 
book. His hero, who is one of the strongest and 
most vital characters that have appeared in our fic- 
tion, is first and foremost a politician. Plunged in 
the thick of New York politics, coming into close 
contact with all sorts of political types, even the 
most degraded, not shrinking from any task, how- 
ever disagreeable, he shows us by his example how 
a man may keep clean in the worst surroundings, 
and emphasises the lesson that it is only by tempo- 
rarily accepting politics as they are that we can 
hope eventually to make them what they should be. 
The implied rebuke to those who merely scold, sit- 
ting aloof in the seat of the scornful, is all the more 
severe because it is conveyed only by implication. 
To discern the soul of good in so evil a thing as 
municipal politics calls for sympathies that are not 
often united with a sane ethical outlook ; but Peter 
Stirling is possessed of the one without losing his 
sense of the other, and it is this combination of 
qualities that makes of him so impressive and ad- 
mirable a figure. The book is not all politics. A 
very charming love-story relieves the harshness of 
the central theme. Numerous minor types flit in 
and out of the scene, and the scene itself shifts often 
enough to afford an agreeable variety. But the main 
interest attaches, after all, to the "practical ideal- 
ist " of the title, a figure far from prepossessing at 
the outset, but gaining steadily upon the affections 
and the esteem as the story pursues its course. " The 
Honorable Peter Stirling " is not the Great Amer- 
ican Novel for several reasons. Its style is very 
faulty, for one thing, and the writer's touch is 
heavy where it should be light, for another. But 
it is both a readable and an ethically helpful book, 
remarkable as coming from a writer without train- 
ing (as far as we know) in the art of fiction, and 
hence deserving of cordial commendation. 

Some time ago, Mr. Herbert Ward wrote a story 
in which the President of the United States, in- 
veigled on board of a swift cruiser, was kidnapped 
and held for ransom. More recently, Mr. " Anthony 
Hope" has told the story of a German monarch,

also feloniously entrapped, whose place was taken 
by a man strikingly similar in appearance, the sub- 
jects of the prince remaining unconscious of the de- 
ception. We do not say that Mr. Clowes, the au- 
thor of " The Double Emperor," has actually taken 
his story from these sources, but it is a theory hardly 
to be avoided by anyone who has read the two tales 
in question. In this case, the Emperor of Lusatia 
(read Germany) is the victim of the kidnappers, 
who are enterprising Americans, and who carry out 
their nefarious scheme through the innocent offices 
of one Esek Hoodlum, of New York, who was once 
a fellow-student with the Emperor, who has his confi- 
dence, and who writes articles about him f or " Scrarp- 
ner's Magazine." It was really a little unkind to 
rechristen Mr. Poultney Bigelow with so very ob- 
jectionable a name, to say nothing of representing 
him as so extremely gullible as he here appears. But 
this is merely parenthetical. The Emperor's double 
is a young cavalry officer, who has been trained to 
personate his master, and thereby relieve the latter 
from attendance upon all sorts of Lusatian cere- 
monials. The abduction of the real Emperor, con- 
sequently, fails to produce the intended effect, for 
no one discovers that he has been abducted until 
after his escape, return, and proclamation of the 
fact. This outline of a wildly improbable but fairly 
interesting story gives the main facts, but no idea 
of how ingeniously the details are worked out. It 
is purely a story of incident and adventure, with 
nothing that bears the remotest resemblance to de- 
lineation of character. Indeed, so wooden a collec- 
tion of puppets are not often worked by a novelist. 
Of course, it all ends happily, and the villainous 
Colonel Snaggs, the arch-plotter, meets with a just 
retribution for his crimes. 

The irruption of the Scotsman into literature is 
one of the most noteworthy of present-day move- 
ments. We do not now refer to Stevenson and Mr. 
Lang, who long ago became cosmopolitans, but to 
such writers as Mr. Barrie, " Ian Maclaren," and 
Mr. S. R. Crockett, all of whom remain intensely 
local, at least in their most characteristic produc- 
tions. It is to the latter of the three, the chronicler 
of Galloway, that our attention is just now directed 
by "The Lilac Sunbonnet," a novel that seems to 
us distinctly superior to anything yet done by the 
annalist of Thrums. Mr. Crockett very frankly 
calls this book " a love-story," and a love-story it is, 
charming and unabashed. It has, moreover, the 
setting of Scotch landscape and the background of 
a narrow and disputatious theology that have been 
turned to effective account by many a love-story 
teller before, from the author of "The Heart of Mid- 
Lothian" to the author of "A Daughter of Heth." 
The account of that remnant of the faithful, the 
"true Kirk of God in Scotland; commonly called 
the Marrow Kirk," is as delightful a piece of the- 
ological characterization as we have often met with, 
although it verges upon the burlesque when the two 
men who constitute the entire ministry of the com- 



munion are made solemnly to depose one another 
from office, thus leaving " the Kirk o' the Marrow, 
precious and witnessing," without any head at all. 
But our main concern is, after all, with the two 
young people whose love-story goes on in spite of 
the dangers impending over the kirk, and who are, 
in fact, unwittingly the cause of so close an approach 
to so disastrous an extinction. It is a story told in 
prose by one who is a poet at heart ; who permits 
his pen to rhapsodize when ordinary prose would 
be inadequate, but who never goes too far in exu- 
berant expression, and rounds up every sentimental 
passage with some sly or shrewdly satirical observa- 
tion that leaves one in doubt whether to laugh or 
to weep. "It is a fallacy common among girls that 
young men desire them as sisters " Mr. Crockett's 
satire has no shafts more keenly-pointed than this. 
Even the dialect talk which he uses is so manifestly 
accurate, so brimming over with life and humor, 
that we cannot find a harsh name for it, albeit there 
is no slight difficulty in its comprehension, and it 
represents a prevalent literary tendency that ought 
to be frowned upon. 

After writing something like a score of novels, 
the most fertile of inventions is likely to flag ; and 
we are not surprised to find in " The People of the 
Mist " a rearrangement of the materials already 
exploited in " She," " King Solomon's Mines," and 
" Montezuma's Daughter." From the first two of 
these ingenious productions Mr. Haggard has bor- 
rowed the mysterious African people isolated from 
the rest of the world, the rock excavations, and the 
colossal statue carved from the mountain-side ; from 
the latter he has taken the whole framework of the 
new romance. In fact, so obvious a reproduction of 
one's former self passes the bounds of the permis- 
sible. And yet, such is the instinctive craving of 
the normally-constituted mind for adventure and 
romantic happenings generally, thousands of read- 
ers will become absorbed in the fortunes of Mr. 
Haggard's newest heroes, while recognizing almost 
every incident as hackneyed, and while realizing 
the slipshod style of the narrative, or rather its total 
lack of anything that is properly to be called style. 
Even the cheap device of astonishing an untutored 
people by the display of firearms is once more 
pressed into service, while the old trick of posing 
for gods with a barbarous tribe is the mainspring 
of the action. It is all very familiar, but it is also 
very thrilling, and boys of most ages will welcome 
the story in spite of its many imperfections. 

A story of even greater improbability than that 
just described is the work of Mr. Edward T. Bouve', 
and is entitled " Centuries Apart." Since, in the 
case of "The Double Emperor," we have ventured 
to construct a possible line of literary descent, a sim- 
ilar suggestion may by allowed in the present in- 
stance. The elements of " Centuries Apart " might 
have been derived from three books : Mr. Marriott- 
Watson's " Marahuna," Mr. Murray's " Gobi or 
Shamo," and Mr. Clemens's "A Yankee at the

Court of King Arthur." The first of these novels 
supplies the idea of mysterious lands beyond the 
Antarctic ice-barrier, the second that of an old civ- 
ilization preserved by being cut off from the 1 rest of 
the world, and the third that of bringing an enter- 
prising American into contact with the life of me- 
diaeval England. To show how these incongruous 
ideas have been combined, a sketch of Mr. Bouv^'s 
plot is necessary. An American squadron, des- 
patched during our Civil War to a Pacific Coast 
station by way of Cape Horn, is driven southward 
by a fierce storm, and finds its way through a hith- 
erto unknown passage into an open Antarctic sea. 
Here a continent is discovered, and found to be peo- 
pled by fifteenth-century Englishmen, who, a few 
years after the Tudor victory of Bosworth Field, 
had sought a home in the new world just discovered 
by one Christopher Columbus, and who had, like 
their followers of the nineteenth century, been driven 
by storms to the land of Mr. Bouves extremely ro- 
mantic tale. By these ingenious inventions, two 
civilizations of four " centuries apart " are brought 
together by the author. We will leave the details 
of this meeting to be gathered from the book itself, 
adding only that the plot is developed with much 
skill, that it includes many thrilling happenings, and 
that it is set forth with no slight degree of literary 
art. Indeed, it is a tale distinctly out of the com- 
mon, and its materials, while not absolutely fresh 
in fiction, are at least not of the overworked sort 
that we recognize in ninety -nine novels out of every 
hundred. 

The writer who nowadays achieves a popular suc- 
cess is pretty sure to make hay while the sun shines, 
but such assiduity in the field as has recently been 
displayed by the author of " The Prisoner of Zenda " 
is to say the least uncommon, even in these days of 
swift and easy composition. Besides many contribu- 
tions to the magazines, this most industrious of hay- 
makers promptly put forth " A Change of Air," 
which we reviewed some weeks ago, and " The 
Dolly Dialogues," a clever production that must at 
least be mentioned. Besides these things, we note 
the simultaneous appearance of two new novels, 
" The God in the Car " and " The Indiscretion of 
the Duchess." The former of these books derives 
its odd title from the Car of Juggernaut, as that 
vehicle exists in popular fancy, moving resistlessly 
forward, and crushing all who come in its way. 
The " God " who presides over this destruction is 
an Englishman of the type exemplified by Mr. Cecil 
Rhodes, who is engaged in the promotion of a great 
African Company, and whose resolute will shrinks 
from nothing in the accomplishment of its purpose. 
The story is almost wholly one of conversation, is 
fairly rapid in its movement, and contrives to in- 
terest us in a dozen people without making us feel 
that any one of them is a real or even a possible 
character. 

" The Indiscretion of the Duchess" may be de- 
scribed in much the same terms as the above, al- 



though it has an added element of romantic adven- 
ture, and displays a piquant ingenuity of invention. 
It is all very impossible and very fascinating ; its 
secret seems to lie in the fact that the reader is kept 
constantly alert for new developments, which are 
never quite what is anticipated. Like all the rest 
of the author's books, it provides capital entertain- 
ment and is not in the least fatiguing. 

" Amygdala : A Tale of the Greek Revolution " 
is a pretty story by Mrs. Edmonds, a writer already 
well-known for other studies of the interesting pe- 
riod of modern history with which this tale is con- 
cerned. We read in these pages of an Englishman 
who, following Byron's noble example, devotes his 
fortune and his life to the Greek cause, and who, 
happier than the poet, lives to see Greece freed from 
the Turk. Bound up with the patriotic motive is 
the motive of love, for the Englishman becomes 
enamored of the daughter of a village pappas, and 
finds in her affection an additional reason for activ- 
ity in behalf of the Greek cause. The outcome of 
the story is tragic, although the tragedy is chastened 
and purified by the sacrifice of the heroine. 

The " Sibylla " of Sir H. S. Cunningham evinces 
some training in the art of fiction, and the capacity 
to produce a conventional, well-bred, and fairly 
readable novel of English society. The taste and 
style of the writer are good enough to bear the 
weight of material which is exceedingly hackneyed, 
consisting, for the most part, of the career of an 
English gentleman in politics, diversified by a secret 
stain upon the family honor, which casts a tempo- 
rary cloud over his domestic happiness. The lead- 
ing character is of a type far from sympathetic, but 
it doubtless exists, and its present portrayal is not 
devoid of interest. 

The pun so obviously suggested by the title of 
M. Zola's latest novel is amply justified by the mat- 
ters with which the document deals. The events of 
five days are told in as many hundreds of pages, 
and nothing is spared us of detail. We start from 
Paris to Lourdes in the first chapter, and with the 
closing pages we return. On the way to the famous 
resort, nearly every conceivable variety of loath- 
some disease is exhibited with brutal realism. When 
we reach Lourdes, the various types that throng the 
place are passed in review one by one, and we are 
invited to contemplate, in strange juxtaposition, the 
various aspects of scepticism and credulity, of sor- 
did commercialism and of mystical fervor. It must 
be admitted that to read the book is almost equiv- 
alent to making the journey. One can no more 
forget the one than the other. There are also de- 
tached scenes of great power and scattered passages 
of a beauty so marked that even the English trans- 
lation cannot miss it. M. Zola is particularly happy, 
here as in " Le Reve," as an interpreter of the mys- 
tical quality of religious faith. But there is little 
to be said for the novel as a work of constructive 
art. The two characters who are intended to supply 
the nucleus of the interest are conceived with force

THE DIAL 



and sympathy, but their lives are mixed up with, 
yet not logically related to, so bewildering a mass 
of episode that they do not emerge as they ought 
to. It is the old story ; M. Zola gives us most of 
the elements of art ; he fails to give us the synthetic 
structure. His pages teem with life actual, vis- 
ible, palpitating -but the one step beyond is not 
taken, and the one supreme effect not attained. 

The name of the foremost Hungarian novelist 
has become increasingly familiar to our public dur- 
ing the last two or three years, a fact more largely 
due to the recent celebration of the writer's jubilee 
than to any wide introduction of his works to our 
readers. It must be said, in fact, that Jdkai has not 
yet been translated sufficiently to enable us to judge 
of the value of his achievement. Of his hundred 
and fifty odd pieces of fiction, but a very few have 
been put into English garb, and it must be admitted 
that those few do not account for his great reputa- 
tion. That reputation, when duly sifted, will doubt- 
less be found to contain elements of many sorts, and 
to the patriotic rather than to the strictly literary 
elements we shall be forced to look to understand 
the main strength of his position among his coun- 
trymen. The mere bulk of his work is imposing, 
and Hungarians must take much pride in the pos- 
session of so prolific a writer ; and besides this, his 
activity as a citizen has been associated with those 
political movements of the past half-century which 
have appealed most forcibly to the Magyar heart. 
The latter proposition is illustrated by the novel pub- 
lished in 1890, crowned by the Hungarian Academy 
as the best novel of that year, and now translated into 
English by Mr. R. Nisbet Bain. In " Eyes Like 
the Sea " there is quite as much of autobiography 
as of fiction. The author refers to himself by name, 
tells of his patriotic activities during the great rev- 
olutionary year, of his wooing and his married life. 
But with this personal narrative there is twined an 
obviously fictitious thread, upon which hang the 
fortunes of an extraordinary young woman named 
Bessy the possessor of the eyes of sea-like hue and 
depth who takes to herself five successive hus- 
bands, and who dies in prison under a life sentence 
for the murder of the last. There is something fas- 
cinating about the story of this erratic young woman, 
in spite of the gross improbability of most of the 
things done by her, and the author's pictures of the 
struggle of 1848 are extremely vivid. These are 
the merits of what is otherwise a harum-scarum 
story, which is not, we must add, translated into 
even acceptable English. 

A new translation of Herr Bjornson's novels is 
a thing to be welcomed, but enthusiasm is at least 
tempered by the discovery that " SynnOve Solbak- 
ken," the first volume issued, is but an old transla- 
tion revamped, and by the further fact that the 
announcement makes no promise of Herr Bjiirn- 
son's two most important novels, " Det Flager i 
Byen og paa Havnen " and " Paa Gud's Veje." 
Mr. Edmund Gosse is to edit the series, and sup- 



plies this first volume with a rambling essay of some 
seventy-five pages, in which we find a sketch of 
Herr Bjornson's life and literary production, and 
some attempt to correlate his activities with those 
of his home and foreign contemporaries. We do 
not expect accuracy from Mr. Gosse, and hence are 
not surprised to read that " SynnOve Solbakken " 
was first turned into English in 1870. In point of 
fact, it was translated (or rather paraphrased) by 
Mary Howitt in 1858. " Norsk Folkebled " and 
" Tourganieff " are probably printer's errors, but 
we are not so sure of " Frakerk " for " Frakark," 
and " Sigurd the Bastard " is not admissible for 
" Sigurd Slembe." Moreover, we are told that this 
great work is a poem, although it is about nine- 
tenths prose. But we may even forgive these things 
in view of Mr. Gosse's recognition of the rank of 
" Sigurd Slembe " among the works of its author. 
He says : " In all the various repertory of Bjorn- 
son, there is perhaps no single work in which so 
high a level of technical excellence is aimed at, and 
at the same time so harmonious and dignified a 
result obtained. Looking over the twenty-five or 
thirty volumes which Bjornson has presented to the 
public, there is probably not one from which, in 
Landor's phrase, there is less for criticism 'to pare 
away ' than from ' Sigurd Slembe.' " This is strictly 
true. " Sigurd Slembe " is the greatest of Herr 
Bjornson's works, and, with the possible exception 
of " Brand," the greatest work in all Norwegian 
literature. Mr. Gosse makes a number of com- 
parisons between Herr Bjornson and Dr. Ibsen,, 
some of which are intelligible and some not. To 
this second category belongs the statement, made 
after some remarks about the cold and self-restrained 
manner of the latter poet, that "Bjornson would die 
in such an atmosphere, like an eagle in a Leyden 
jar" The italics are ours. One more perplexing 
statement deserves attention. Speaking of " Kon- 
gen," Mr. Gosse says : " Few even of Bjornson's 
admirers appreciated it at first." Then comes the 
following foot-note : " The present writer was among 
them, and published certain remarks for which (be- 
ing grown older and wiser) he would now do pen- 
ance, in a white sheet." This is all clear enough^ 
but we cannot reconcile it with Mr. Gosse's final 
estimate of the work in question, when he says that, 
" as one reads ' The King ' to-day, it is difficult to 
realize how so brilliant an intellectual extravaganza, 
so daring a political dream, should have failed to 
fascinate us from the first." If Mr. Gosse hopea 
ever to be taken seriously as a critic or as a scholar, 
he must reform his slipshod methods, in Hamlet's 

phrase, " altogether.'' , .. -.

some sound and B ? ks of sound and readable musical 
readable musical criticism are rare, and we commend 
criticism. Mr w F Apthorp's nine essays, 

collectively called " Musicians and Music-Lovers " 
(Scribner), as one of the best books of its class. 
The musicians to whom these essays give individual 
treatment are Bach, Handel, Meyerbeer, Offenbach, 
Franz, Dresel, and John Sullivan Dwight, a 
strangely-assorted gathering. The essays of a more 
general character are, besides that which gives the 
collection its title, " Some Thoughts on Musical 
Criticism " and " Music and Science." In one of 
his earliest pages, Mr. Apthorp remarks that " mu- 
sic is a subject on which all logic is wasted "; but 
we are inclined to think that he refutes his own dic- 
tum on more occasions than one, for if these essays 
illustrate anything besides their special subjects it 
is the fact that an appeal to the reason may be made 
on behalf of music quite as well as on behalf of any 
other art. The author appeals throughout to the 
intelligence, and eschews altogether the rhapsodizing 
that passes for criticism with many writers. Yet 
he by no means countenances the common notion 
that " the musician is capable only of a merely in- 
tellectual enjoyment of music." On this point he 
even uses strong language, and goes so far as to say 
that " of all the wrong notions that have ever be- 
muddled the human mind, this is the most utterly 
idiotic." But to feel the beauty of music is one 
thing, and to put the feeling into words is quite an- 
other. To attempt the latter is simply to attempt 
the impossible ; and Mr. Apthorp confines himself 
to the things that really can be said by one rational 
being to another. With the motive that sends the 
majority of listeners to concert-room or opera-hall 
the desire to hear someone sing or play, rather 
than the desire to hear the performance of some 
work the author has no great patience. " For 
what, think you, does the average music-lover look 
first, when he reads the advertisement of a concert 
in the newspapers ? In ninety-nine cases out of a 
hundred he looks first to see who is to be the solo 
performer ; what the programme is to be interests 
him only secondarily. Show me the man who looks 
first to see what is to be played or sang, and I will 
hold him in my very heart of heart as a music- 
lover who deserves to be a musician ! " These are 
golden words ; and let no one fancy himself a lover 
of music in the true sense unless he can put the ques- 
tion to himself, and honestly answer it in the right 
way. Sensible, well-put things abound in these es- 
says, and a touch of humor is not lacking. " I have 
heard many people complain that fugues are dry ; 
you might say, with equal reason, that demijohns 
are dry some are and some are not, it all de- 
pends upon what is in them." Fugues naturally 
remind us of Bach, and lead us to say that the es- 
say on that composer is one of the best apprecia- 
tions of his genius with which we are acquainted. 



" The English 
Novel " and the 



Delight in that colossal genius is another of the tests 
of true musical feeling, quite as good a test as the 
one already given. And, strange to say, the test is 
one that, more than most others, is likely to evoke 
an honest answer. Or, as Mr. Apthorp puts it : 
" Many people who have to keep up a reputation for 
musical taste will bear the infliction of a Schumann 
quartette or a Brahms symphony quite smilingly ; 
they will grin and bear it, and try to think they 
like it. But Bach marks the point where the worm 
will turn; he is the last straw that breaks the back 
of musical endurance, and people admit quite 
frankly that they find him intolerable." Most of us 
who have been curious to know whether our friends 
really cared for music have had that experience 
more than once. A longer review than the present 
would be needed to do justice to the acuteness, the 
insight, and the genuine musicianly feeling of Mr. 
Apthorp's volume. Our only regret is that he should 
not have polished his style a little more, avoiding, 
for example, such a solecism as " neither . . . were," 
and that he should countenance the common mis- 
spelling of Handel's name. 

How wide our forefathers would have 
opened their eyes if they could have 
"Study of Fiction." f oreseen tnat novel-reading would 

become a serious study in the closing years of the 
century, and be urged as an important element in 
general education ! Here and there an old-fashioned 
objector still raises a protesting voice ; but the Zeit- 
geist is against him, and it is now impossible for the 
student to ignore what has come to be ( with the pos- 
sible exception of poetry) the most typical and gen- 
erally cultivated of the literary arts. Even the pul- 
pit that last bulwark of conservative prejudice 
has taken kindly to the novel, and many a sermon 
is preached upon some popular fiction of the day. 
The University Extension people, in their effort to 
provide pabulum of sufficient tenuity to be easily 
assimilable by delicate digestions, have with pecu- 
liar avidity seized upon fiction as providing instruc- 
tion and entertainment in suitable proportions, and 
it is wholly natural that we should have at last a 
University Extension manual upon " The English 
Novel" (Scribner). This little book, which is a his- 
torical and critical sketch of the subject from the 
earliest times down to " Waverley," is the work of 
Professor Walter Raleigh, an experienced English 
teacher. It is rather dry in manner, but presents 
a well-arranged conspectus of fact. We are half 
through the book before we reach what most peo- 
ple suppose to have been the first English novelists ; 
but undoubtedly something must be said in such a 
history of the " Morte Darthur" and "Euphues," 
of "Arcadia" and the " Spectator," and even of less 
direct precursors of the modern novelist. Prof. 
W. E. Simonds, who at the same time has published 
" An Introduction to the Study of Fiction" (Heath), 
is even more inclusive, for he begins with u Beo- 
wulf " and " King Horn." His book consists of 
a few pleasant chapters on the more marked his-

torical phases of the subject, followed by a dozen 
rather lengthy extracts, ranging from the pagan 
epic of our Saxon forebears to Fielding and Sterne. 
" A bare introduction to the study," and no more, 
is what the author has sought to offer his readers. 
There are some useful chronological tables, and a 
list of a hundred novels, English and Continental, 
"which, for one reason or another, are quite worth 
reading." Our only quarrel with the list is that it 
strangely omits the name of Tourgue'nieff, although 
Gogol, Tolstoi, and Dostoieffski appear. This is 
much like leaving Scott out of a list of English nov- 
elists, or Shakespeare out of a selection of Eliza- 
bethan dramatists. 

" A History of English Literature for 
A text-book oj an Secondary Schools" (Harper), by 

old-fashioned sort. J . \ .' J 

Mr. J. Logic Robertson, is a text- 
book of the old-fashioned sort, admirable as a com- 
pact presentation of accurate fact, but calculated to 
encourage cramming, and to substitute memoriter 
work for that acquisition of power which should be 
the real aim of every student. The subject is 
neatly divided up into periods and groups, cut-and- 
dried critical opinions are provided, and a conspec- 
tus of the facts of political history served as an ac- 
companiment. Beyond the general misconception 
of the purpose of a text-book, the work is not open 
to much technical criticism. There is an occasional 
comment which strikes one as curiously platitudin- 
ous, such as the following : " The religious novel 
is a remarkable feature of current fiction, and prob- 
ably owes its origin to the skepticism of the age." 
No treatment of Shakespeare, even the briefest, 
should ignore, as Mr. Robertson's does, the periods 
in the poet's development. A serious lack of per- 
spective is often noticeable, particularly when Scotch 
writers are concerned. On these occasions only 
does the writer display a touch of enthusiasm ; and 
one cannot refrain from thinking that he considers 
the work of mere Englishmen poor stuff. The at- 
tempt is made to provide extracts as well as history, 
which cannot be done to any satisfaction at all in a 
book of this size. American writers are supposed 
to come within the author's plan, but the few par- 
agraphs they get are grudging and inadequate. We 
cannot, on the whole, accord the book any other 
than an extremely qualified commendation. 

The military The "Great Commanders Series" 

career of (Appleton) rightly includes the story 

General Hancock. of the m jli tar y career o f General 

Hancock, one of the most splendid soldiers that the 
Civil War produced, though he never held an inde- 
pendent command. It has been written by General 
Francis A. Walker, who was a member of Hancock's 
staff, out of the full knowledge gained through his 
personal knowledge of his hero, personal participa- 
tion in many of the stirring scenes with which the 
book abounds, and several years of labor spent upon 
his " History of the Second Army Corps." The 
book also shows the literary skill of a trained writer. 



This knowledge and skill, combined with the bril- 
liant career set forth in the book, make it one of 
absorbing interest, perhaps the best in the series. 
Unlike most military biographies, it is free from 
painful personal controversies. General Hancock 
was of generous and loyal spirit, obeying heartily 
even when acting under orders that he knew were 
bad. He had the power of infusing his own sol- 
dierly spirit and enthusiasm into his men, and so 
of bringing his brigade or division or corps into 
action to the best advantage, and of leading it 
through the most trying marches without loss of 
spirit. Not till the very end of the campaign of 
1864, after the awful experiences and losses of that 
terrible summer, were "his lines broken, his men 
driven from the ground, guns and colors taken un- 
der his eye. . . . Never before had he seen his men 
fail to respond to the utmost when he called upon 
them personally for a supreme effort." It was a 
blow from which he never recovered, though all 
acknowledged that he had done all that could be 
done under the circumstances. General Walker's 
book is more than a sketch of Hancock's career : 
it contains spirited descriptions of nearly all the 
battles in which the Army of the Potomac was en- 
gaged, from the Peninsular campaign through 1864. 
The best of these descriptions are those of Gettys- 
burg, where Hancock won his greatest glory, and 
the capture of the Salient at Spottsylvania. The 
successive commanders of the Army, especially 
Burnside, Hooker, and Grant, are freely criticised 
by General Walker ; yet the criticism is not bitter, 
but eminently fair. 

Another of the stories of the triumph

poverty and physical weakness is 
given us by the veteran biographer Samuel Smiles 
in his " Life of Josiah Wedgwood " ( Harper ) . The 
world never tires of these splendid triumphs, and 
they supply a healthy stimulus to ambition. Of 
greater interest, however, because less familiar, is 
the history of the development of artistic pottery, 
and of a great industry out of the humble making 
of butter-pots and porringers that occupied the 
meagre population of Burslem till his time. Young 
Wedgwood began life with twenty pounds and a 
frail body, ever tormented with pain and often un- 
able to leave his bed. His inquisitive mind was not 
content with the poor processes that had contented 
his fathers and forefathers. His eagerness for ex- 
periments caused his brothers to set him adrift from 
the family business. But his keen business ability 
and insight soon brought him success. A new 
ware was discovered and put upon the market as 
soon as the preceding was no longer popular. The 
queen allowed her name to be attached to one of 
the standard wares, a vast foreign trade was built 
up, and fortune and national reputation came to 
him. To this day he ranks as one of the great men 
of the eighteenth century in England. This success 
was won by his ceaseless costly experiments with

materials gathered from every part of the world, and 
by the application of true art to even the humbler 
products of his potteries. He developed the manu- 
facture of artistic vases, cameos, portraits, and other 
pieces of high excellence which nobility and royalty 
were eager to purchase. Among the interesting 
incidents of the book are the account of the making 
of the great table-service of nearly a thousand pieces 
for the Empress of Russia, the preparation of which 
occupied about eight years ; that of his relations 
with the sculptor Flaxman, who long furnished de- 
signs for his products ; and the copying of the Bar- 
berini, or Portland Vase, and other works of an- 
tiquity. The book is written in the well-known 
commonplace style of the author, with numerous 
repetitions, yet clearly, and with full knowledge of 
the subject and his work. 

Closing volume of The ninth and closin g V lume f 

Professor Huxley's Professor Huxley's collected essays 
collected essays. ig entitled " Evolution and Ethics 
and Other Essays" (Appleton). It includes the 
Romanes Lecture of the title (provided with some 
fifty pages of prolegomena for the confutation of 
captious critics) ; a paper, dated 1886, on " Science 
and Morals "; another, dated 1890, entitled " Cap- 
ital the Mother of Labour"; and the contents of 
the pamphlet of 1891 on "Social Diseases and 
Worse Remedies." Now that the man against whose 
pretensions and activities that pamphlet was directed 
has been received with open arms by so many of 
our fellow-countrymen, Professor Huxley's objec- 
tions to " corybantic Christianity " are given a re- 
newed timeliness. Professor Huxley, in his preface, 
remarks that, " Mr. Booth's standing army remains 
afoot, retaining all the capacities for mischief which 
are inherent in its constitution. I am desirous that 
this fact should be kept steadily in view; and that 
the moderation of the clamour of the drums and 
trumpets should not lead us to forget the existence 
of a force which, in bad hands, may, at any time, 
be used for bad purposes." It is extremely satis- 
factory to note the completion of this series of Pro- 
fessor Huxley's miscellaneous writings. However 
their timeliness may become impaired, their useful- 
ness for other purposes as examples of clear-cut 
cogent argument, and of a popularization which de- 
tracts nothing from the dignity of science will out- 
live more than the present generation. The author 
has, all his life long, fought sturdily against the ba- 
tallions of ignorance and prejudice, and his reward 
is assured in the thankfulness of the thousands whom 
he has helped to think clearly, and to whose lives 
he has supplied an effective ethical impulse. 



A satisfactory 
life of Cicero. 



Cicero's life was the very storm- 
centre of the decline and fall of the 
Roman Republic. To treat the one 
satisfactorily, it is necessary to treat the other fully. 
Mr. Strachan-Davidson does it charmingly in his 
volume on " Cicero and the Fall of the Roman Re- 
public" (Putnam). There is not a dry spot in the 



book, which is preeminently a candid and compre- 
hensive treatment of the greatest of orators, and a 
philosophic discussion of the turbulent times which 
made his life so tragic. It is refreshing to find this 
work unstained by hero-worship, the blot on the 
pages of Froude and many others, who have at- 
tempted sketches of Roman statesmen. Especially 
commendable is the scientific spirit of treatment 
which forms the background of the work. We might 
call it a laboratory study, in recognition of the fact 
that it is studiously compiled, for the most part, 
from original sources of information, chiefly from 
the incomparable letters of Cicero himself, letters 
still in their primeval purity, unimpaired by the red- 
pencil marks of the editor. Mr. Strachan-David- 
son appropriates these letters with a lavish hand, 
supplementing them with just enough of his own 
narrative to keep the chain of facts intact. Any 
other method of writing the biography of the an- 
cients must necessarily draw too freely on the im- 
agination of the author. Mr. Strachan-Davidson's 
translations are excellent for their solid expression 
and lack of all frothiness. We are struck by his 
clear statement of the positions of the Nobles and 
the Knights, and his unclouded treatment of the 
relations which existed at various stages between 
Cicero and his contemporaries, Caesar, Pompey, and 
Anthony. Never were they made plainer. We are 
impressed also by the occasional paragraphs on 
Roman politics, which, in point of "favoritism," 
"log-rolling," and corruption by wealth, seems not 
to have differed greatly from our own. This book, 
though written two thousand years after the birth 
of Cicero, is opportune. During this great lapse of 
time the lustre of Cicero's name has not been dimmed. 
Mr. Strachan-Davidson's excellent biography will 
be found to give in the best form what modern stu- 
dents demand. Abundant foot-notes testify to the 
faithful work which the production of the book has 
cost its author. 

Another of the pretty books that are 
A "Prelude printed in London by the Messrs. 

to Poetry." J . 

Dent, and sold in this country by 
the Messrs. Macmillan, is called "The Prelude to 
Poetry," and is edited by Mr. Ernest Rhys. It 
is designed as the first volume of a series called 
" The Lyrical Poets," and the volumes to follow 
will be made up of selections from the lyric treas- 
ures of our speech. This " prelude," however, con- 
tains, instead of poetry, the best things that have 
been said about poetry in the prose of our English 
poets, from Chaucer to Landor. Sidney's " Apol- 
ogie for Poetry" and Shelley's " Defence of Poesy," 
are the chief courses in this critical banquet ; but 
the releves, pastries, and other adjuncts of a well- 
appointed repast, are not missing. We have ex- 
tracts from Spenser, Campion, and Daniel, from 
Jonson's " Discoveries," from Milton, Dryden, and 
Pope, from Gray, Goldsmith, and Burns, from 
Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats. And this choice 
collection of weighty matters is properly introduced 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



by the editor, whose pleasant opening essay pre- 
pares the mind for what is to follow. " What we 
find in these contributions," he says, " is a set of 
testimonies not at all scientific, but such as they are, 
-making a much more delightful and eloquent com- 
panion to the poetic anthology than any more for- 
mal body of criticism could do." And we are quite 
prepared to endorse the further statement of Mr. 
Rhys, that " to those who love these poets most, 
who care most for their ideals, this little book ought 
to be the one indispensable book of devotion, the 
credo of the poetic faith." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor H. Graetz's " History of the Jews " (Phil- 
adelphia: Jewish Publication Society) still pursues its 
voluminous course, but we are reminded by the appear- 
ance of the fourth volume, which covers the period 
from 1270 to 1618, that the end cannot be far distant. 
The former of the dates which stand as boundary-posts 
to the present volume is that assigned to the rise of the 
Kabbala and its cultivation in Spain and elsewhere. 
Among the subjects that follow are the successive ex- 
pulsions of the Jews from France, Spain, and Portugal, 
the persecutions caused by the Black Death, the progress 
of Jewish literature during the middle ages, Reuchlin's 
defense of the Jewish literature, the Jews in Sixteenth 
Century Turkey and Poland, and the permanent settle- 
ment of the Marranos in Holland. The date of this 
settlement was 1618, which marks the limit set for the 
present volume, but a closing chapter on " The Dutch 
Jerusalem and the Thirty Years' War " carries on the 
annals to the date of the Peace of Westphalia. 

Professor James M. Garnett's edition of " Hayne's 
Speech to which Webster Replied " (Maynard) takes 
the form of a pamphlet for school use, but it is not often 
that a text for this purpose is edited with so much pains. 
The editor's part of the work consists of a careful biog- 
raphy of Hayne, a special article on " The Great De- 
bate," and a few notes. The text has been collated with 
the copy presented by Hayne to Madison, and with the 
copy in a volume of speeches preserved by Mrs. Hayne. 
It is well to have the Southern side of the argument 
studied in our schools, which have too often been con- 
tent with an examination of the famous " Reply." 

It seems that we were a little premature when, in our 
last notice of the " Dictionary of National Biography " 
{Macmillan) we stated that the letter M was done with. 
But who could have foreseen a whole series of Mylnes, 
to say nothing of two Myrddins and a Myvyr ? These 
names, with a large share of the N's, are found in Vol- 
ume XL. of the great work just published. In this vol- 
ume the Napiers fill a large place, four of them, includ- 
ing Lord Napier of Magdala, getting several pages each. 
The longest biography is Mr. Glazebrook's Sir Isaac 
Newton; the next longest, Professor Laughton's Nelson. 
Thomas Nash, by the editor, and Cardinal Newman, by 
Mr. W. S. Lilly, are the articles of greatest literary 
interest. 

" Chambers's Concise Gazetter of the World " (Lip- 
pincott) is a volume of moderate dimensions, based 
chiefly upon the geographical articles of " Chambers's 
Encyclopaedia." The latest official figures have been 
used by the compiler, interesting etymologies are given, 



and brief justice is done to historical and literary asso- 
ciations. Pronunciation is also indicated as far as pos- 
sible. There are 768 double-columned pages, and the 
volume is substantially bound in half-leather with green 
cloth covers. 

" Pelldas and Mdlisande," which is probably the best 
of M. Maeterlinck's dramatic works, has been trans- 
lated into English by Mr. Erving Winslow, and makes 
a pretty book as now published by Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. The author was terribly handicapped 
upon his last appearance in letters by the injudicious 
deliverances of the French critic who hailed him as a 
new Shakespeare. But we should not let ourselves be 
prejudiced against a man by what his friends say of 
him, and there can be no doubt that the Belgian dra- 
matist has become a sort of literary force. Mr. Wins- 
low contributes to his translation an interesting and 
temperate critical introduction. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, January 10, 1895. 

The first day of this month marked the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the founding of " The Christian Union," 
now " The Outlook." Dr. Lyman Abbott and Mr. 
Hamilton W. Mabie, the editors, are well known in 
their respective fields of labor, but it is of Mr. Mabie 
that I wish especially to speak. He joined the staff 
of "The Outlook" in 1879, and became its associate 
editor five years later. There have been few profes- 
sional men of letters in this city who have accomplished 
more with less fuss than Mr. Mabie during the ensuing 
period. Besides his engrossing editorial duties, he has 
found time to deliver many lectures and addresses and 
to take an active interest in public affairs. But it is as 
the author of the five volumes of literary and social 
essays just issued in a uniform edition that Mr. Mabie 
chiefly demands our attention. In these books are to 
be found the crystallization of his life-work, so various 
and extensive. We should hardly call him a pupil of 
Mitchell and Curtis. Were he not so young, it would 
be more truthful to call him their contemporary. When 
"The Christian Union" was established, its editors de- 
clared, " We are glad to work with any one who is will- 
ing to work with us to make the word better. We do 
not ask what church or party he belongs to, nor what 
name he bears." And this quotation, with suitable 
changes, would apply to Mr. Mabie's writings. They 
seem to me, consciously or unconsciously, to embody a 
complete system of literary philosophy, hidden under a 
fascinating array of discussions of books and life. 

So many people now feel at liberty to speak for Mr. 
Howells, that he has been obliged to send letters to the 
newspapers denying various sentiments attributed to 
him. It is very amusing to find the Boston " Tran- 
script " posing as his defender against " chance shots " 
made at him in his absence by fellow men of letters at 
the Stevenson memorial meeting. I am informed that 
a number of the vice-presidents, including Mr. Howells, 
Mr. Kipling, and others, were not expected to be pres- 
ent at the meeting, a geographical impossibility in 
many cases, but were asked to lend the weight of their 
names as admirers of Stevenson, and that they were 
glad to do so. The idea that any of the speakers took 
advantage of Mr. Howells's absence to make unfavor- 
able references to him is absurd, and the suggestion to 
it reminds me of the days when the Boston " Tran- 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



script " was known as the Boston " Teapot." A tempest 
in a teapot, indeed. In the first place, the speakers 
could not have known whether Mr. Howells was pres- 
ent or not in an audience of two thousand people. 
Probably there is some feeling among the Boston illu- 
minati, because Mr. Howells has come to New York to 
live, yet nothing would surprise me less than to find 
him established next year in Tokio or Cairo, he not be- 
ing a citizen of any one city. 

Mr. James MacArthur, associate-editor with Prof. 
H. Thurston Peck of the American edition of "The 
Bookman," has just returned from London, where he 
has completed arrangements for the publication of that 
periodical. The first number will appear early in 
February; it will contain an article on Dr. Robertson 
Nicoli by Mr. S. R. Crockett, a new poem by Mr. Aus- 
tin Dobson, a rarity in these days, indeed, a London 
letter from Dr. Nicoli, with Robert Louis Stevenson 
for its subject, and a letter on Parisian topics from Mr. 
R. H. Sherard. Professor Boyesen, for the same num- 
ber, will give a survey of German and Scandinavian 
literature for 1894. 

Mr. Noah Brooks will sail for Italy and the Levant 
on the 29th of this month, returning in the early spring, 
Mr. Gilbert Parker is visiting the city, and will remain 
in this country for the rest of the winter. His new 
novel, just completed, will bear the title, "The Seats 
of the Mighty." The fund for a memorial to George 
William Curtis is increasing steadily. A special com- 
mittee of leading citizens of Boston has been formed to 
raise subscriptions in that city and vicinity. It has 
been suggested that a similar committee might be 
formed in Chicago to aid in perpetuating the memory 
of the late occupant of the " Easy Chair."

LITERARY NOTES. 



The text of Dr. Skeats's Chaucer, reprinted in a single 
volume, will appear at once from the press of Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. 

Over a hundred letters written by Scott to Mr. Craig, 
the banker, have been found in the archives of the old 
Leith Bank, at Galashiels. 

The fourth volume of Craik's " English Prose Selec- 
tions " deals with the eighteenth century and will be 
ready for publication early in January. 

Mr. David Christie Murray is to be the guest of the 
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago on the eighteenth 
of this month. " A Poet's Note-Book " is announced as 
the subject of his address. 

We learn with regret that Mrs. Humphry Ward 
has decided not to accompany her husband upon his 
visit to this country. Mr. Ward is expected to arrive 
about the close of January. 

" Little Eyolf," Dr. Ibsen's new play, reviewed from 
the original in the last issue of THE DIAL, has since 
been published by Messrs. Stone & Kimball in Mr. 
William Archer's English translation. 

It is not easy to believe the statement made by " The 
Athenaeum " that Robert Louis Stevenson once offered 
to write a monograph on Hazlitt for the " English Men 
of Letters," and that the offer was declined by the ed- 
itor of the series. 

A " History of Higher Education in Rhode Island," 
by Dr. W. H. Tolman, has just been issued from the 



Government printing office at Washington, in the series 
of monographs upon the educational history of the 
several states. More than half of the contents are de- 
voted to Brown University. 

The limited edition of the little volume containing 
an account of the Bryant celebration at Knox College, 
in November, having been practically disposed of, a 
cheaper edition will be issued, from the same type, but 
bound in paper. Copies may be had by addressing Mr. 
Ernest Elmo Calkins. Galesburg, 111. 

"Le Modele" (H. Laurens, 6 Rue de Tournon, 
Paris) signalizes the completion of its first year by the 
publication of four studies in aquarelle, in place of the 
regular black - and - white plates. This closing num- 
ber of the year also contains a title-page and index, 
together with several pages of text descriptive of the 
ninety-six plates that constitute the first volume. Art- 
students should find this periodical helpful and sugges- 
tive. 

The ninth Quarterly Convocation of the University 
of Chicago was held at the Auditorium on the evening 
of January 2. President Low of Columbia was the 
orator of the occasion, and spoke sensibly and forcibly 
of the relation of universities toward political and social 
problems. President Harper reviewed the work of the 
last quarter, stated that exactly 1,000 students had 
been enrolled, and announced the organization of a new 
department that of pedagogy. He also announced 
several gifts to the University, the most important of 
which was one of $175,000, from Mr. John D. Rocke- 
feller, to be applied upon the current expenses for the 
year. 

A club of twelve book-lovers calling themselves " The 
Duodecimos " has just done an act of piety to the mem- 
ory of Benjamin Franklin by reproducing in facsimile 
"Poor Richard's Almanac for 1733," from the only 
known copy of the original, in the Pennsylvania His- 
torical Society's collection at Philadelphia. The fac- 
simile is printed on a hand-press made in Philadel- 
phia before 1800, ink-balls being used in the primitive 
way; the paper is genuine eighteenth-century handmade 
such as Franklin may have used, but with a little of 
that " wilful waste " of margin which the philosopher 
believed made " wof ul want." An introduction by the 
Hon. John Bigelow in which is reprinted for the first 
time the diverting correspondence between Franklin and 
his chief competitor in the almanac business, one Titan 
Leeds is printed in a modern type cast expressly for 
the purpose, on a handmade paper bearing the club's 
water-marked devices. The frontispiece is a portrait 
of Franklin etched by Thomas Johnson from the Du- 
plessis pastel in Mr. Bigelow's possession; and inter- 
spersed with the text are thirteen other portraits of 
Franklin, apocryphal and otherwise, with notes thereon, 
reproduced in artotype by the Bierstadt process. One 
hundred and forty-four copies only are printed, twelve 
on vellum for the members, and one hundred and thirty- 
two on paper, which have been sold to subscribers. To 
insure absolute fidelity, all quotations have been veri- 
fied by comparison with the original issues complete 
files of which, dating from 1733 to 1758 (Franklin's 
period), have been located, with the exception of the 
issue for 1735, which is nowhere to be found. No pains 
or expense has been spared by the club (which is not a 
money-making enterprise) to make their first venture a 
success, and the DeVinne Press has produced a book 
which for typographical excellence and good taste re- 
flects credit upon itself and upon "The Duodecimos." 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



" Prseco Latinus " is a Latin monthly paper of eight 
pages, published by Mr. Arcade Mogyorossy, of Phila- 
delphia. The contents include brief editorials, criti- 
cism of schoolbooks, educational notes, and other mat- 
ters. The editor is very scornful upon the subject of 
existing methods in the teaching of the classics and 
the popular text-books, and indulges in many " prave 
ords," indicative of the reforms he hopes to accom- 
plish. He occasionally lapses into English, to such 
effect as this : " The purifying waters of reform will 
gradually soak under the financial foundations of the 
Olympian citadels. . . . Before long you will hear the 
rumble of a land-slide, when inflated idols and methods 
will crumble and sink into the surging waves." We com- 
mend " Prseco Latiuus " as a very amusing little sheet, 
however unsound may be the theories of its editor. 

Professor Morse Stephens, Cornell's new professor of 
European history from Oxford, has made some inter- 
esting comparisons between English and American col- 
lege students. He concludes that the average Ameri- 
can undergraduate takes a more comprehensive view of 
history, has a better grasp of its essential facts, and 
surpasses his English cousin of corresponding grade in 
power of generalization; but the American student is 
lamentably deficient in his knowledge of details and 
also writes very poor English. Professor Stephens 
thought the essays written by his undergraduate stu- 
dents at Cornell were on the whole better than similar 
essays written by English students at Cambridge, al- 
though he sharply criticized the spelling, grammar, and 
generally careless style of the Americans. When, how- 
ever, he set his American students an examination of 
twenty questions concerning dates and places, he was 
overwhelmed by the lack of knowledge of facts dis- 
played in the answers. More than half the class failed 
to pass the examination, the average percentage being 
about 40, and as a rule the students who wrote the 
best essays handed in the poorest examination papers. 

The intelligent public has been not a little amused by 
the ignorant onslaught recently made by some of the 
Chicago newspapers upon the improved methods of 
teaching recently introduced into the public schools of 
the city, but it was left for a casual contributor to one 
of those newspapers to cap the climax of absurdity. The 
following is the essential part of his complaint: "In all 
the discussion abovit nature studies, of which I have been 
a careful reader, I do not believe attention has been 
called to the injudicious character of a song which 1 
found in a little book used by the primary teachers in 
the Chicago schools. Here is a verse of it: 

' How does the little crocodile 

Improve his shining tail, 
And pour the water of the Nile 
On every golden scale. 

' How cheerfully he seems to grin, 
How neatly spreads his claws, 
And welcomes little fishes in 
With gently smiling jaws.' 

"My recollection of the habits of the crocodile is that 
he doesn't live on fish at all, although he is said to catch 
birds in the way described. That a little child's atten- 
tion should be called to either fact, however, in a civil- 
ized school-room seems incredible. I was very indig- 
nant when I saw it, as I have two boys in the primary 
grade. I determined that I would not have a boy of 
mine taught such stuff; and to give it a humorous turn, 
as the author of these lines seems to have tried to do, is 
simply monstrous." This is almost too funny for belief. 



Imagine the poems of " Lewis Carroll " subjected, one 
after another, to the searching criticism of science ! 
Some one ought to unearth this indignant parent, and 
present him with a copy of the nursery classic which 
has strangely been left out of his education. 

The following are extracts from two letters written 
by Mr. Lloyd Osbourne, the one to a friend in San Fran- 
cisco, the other to Mr. Sidney Colvin: " Our dear Louis 
died the night of December 3d in the full tide of work 
and life. He passed away without pain or conscious- 
ness, finding the death he had always prayed for. The 
doctors said that nothing could have been done for him; 
he had simply come to the end of his power of living. 
The extraordinary love and kindness we have received 
from our Samoans has passed all knowledge. If any- 
thing could have comforted us, it was the unforgetta- 
ble devotion that they displayed. There was none of 
the professional horrors that make death so terrible. 
Not a strange hand touched him ; his own people dug 
his grave on the high mountain ridge, where it was al- 
ways his wish to lie." ..." My previous letter was in- 
terrupted by the arrival of several of our truest Sam- 
oan chiefs with their last presents for Louis, the fine 
mats that the body of a great man must be wrapped in. 
All night they sat around his body, in company with 
every one of our people, in stolid silence. It was in 
vain that I attempted to get them away. ' This is the 
Samoan way,' they said, and that ended the matter. 
They kissed his hand one by one as they came in. It 
was a most touching sight. You cannot realize what 
giving these mats means. They are the Samoans' for- 
tune. It takes a woman a year to make one, and these 
people of ours were of the poorest."

THE USE AND ABUSE OF DIALECT. 

There are indications not very marked as 
yet, but still indications that the day of the 
dialect versifier and story-teller is waning. The 
literary epidemic for which he is responsible 
has raged with unabated virulence in this coun- 
try for the past ten years or more. It has had 
almost complete possession of the bric-a-brac 
popular magazine. Its contagion has even ex- 
tended to those periodicals which we too fondly 
fancied to stand for the dignities, as opposed 
to the freaks, of literature. At the other ex- 
treme, it has been disseminated and vulgarized 
by the newspaper and the popular reciter. A 
few of the men and women whom we count as 
real forces in American letters have been num- 
bered among its victims. But all epidemics 
exhaust themselves in time, and we are encour- 
aged to believe that this one is nearly spent. 
A tabulation of the contents of our popular 
magazines would now, we think, show a smaller 
proportion of pages unreadable for their bad 
spelling than would have been disclosed by a 
similar investigation made two years ago. The 
journalist, having for a time done his best to 
spread the fashion of dialect, is now aiming at 
it the shafts of his dull yet not ineffective sat- 
ire. Many a literary worker is beginning to 
suspect that to misspell as many words as pos- 
sible is not exactly the noblest of ambitions. 
Best of all, the whole fabric of realism that 
is, of the crude photographic realism so noisily 
trumpeted by its defenders is crumbling away, 
to make room in due time, we trust, for the 
true realism of the masters ; and with this 
fabric there falls whatever theoretical defence 
of the dialect poem or novel may heretofore 
have seemed plausible. 

We by no means anticipate the complete dis- 
appearance of the dialect element from our im- 
aginative literature, nor would such a reaction 
be desirable. But we do expect the time to 
come when dialect shall occupy its proper place 
in composition, and be treated as a means rather 
than as an end. There is an important dis- 
tinction between the story written for the sake 
of dialect and the use of dialect for the sake 
of the story ; the latter practice is as excusable 
or even praiseworthy as the former is repre- 



68 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



hensible. The question is one between a writer 
and his own conscience. Let the story-teller 
ask himself this question : Is it my purpose to 
produce a faithful yet idealized transcript of 
life, with its joys and its sorrows, with its ten- 
der human relationships and its grim struggle 
for the mastery of adverse conditions, the use of 
dialect being one of the elements necessary to 
the representation of essential truth ; or am I 
merely taking advantage of a current fashion 
that tends to degrade the literary art, and, 
making of a grotesque orthography the raison 
d'etre of my work, adding just enough of de- 
scription and fancy and pathos to give my work 
the verisimilitude needed for it to pass muster 
at all ? Most writers have sufficient conscience 
to answer this question truthfully, if squarely 
put ; if they shirk the answer for themselves, 
they may be sure that the public, sooner or later, 
will find it for them. And the ultimate verdict 
of the only public worth writing for will never 
be favorable to the workman who fails to recog- 
nize the imperative obligation of this higher 
sort of conscientiousness. 

When used with discrimination and artistic 
restraint, dialect is, of course, an admissible 
element in both poetry and fiction. English 
literature would be far the poorer without the 
treasures of Scotch dialect preserved in the 
poems of Burns and the novels of the author 
of " Waverley." Likewise, we could ill spare 
the work of the Proven9al poets from the lit- 
erature of France, of Goldoni's Venetian com- 
edies from that of Italy, or of Renter's Platt- 
deutsch tales from that of Germany. In all 
these cases, the work simply could not have 
been done at all without the employment of 
dialect ; yet no one would venture to assert 
that the exploitation of a dialect was the prime 
motive that led to the composition of " Tarn 
O'Shanter " or " The Antiquary," of " Mireio " 
or " II Carnovale di Venezia " or " Ut Mine 
Stromtid." These are all instances of a richly 
endowed artistic nature finding expression in 
the medium most natural for his purpose. Even 
in our own country, a similar plea may be made 
for the language of Hosea Biglow, or of Mr. 
Cable's Creoles, or of Miss Murfree's Tennes- 
see mountaineers. But the swarm of common- 
place and uninspired scribblers of dialect that 
have descended upon our periodical press dur- 
ing the past decade need not hope to find a safe 
refuge in the shadow of such really significant 
names as have been cited ; their pretensions 
are too utterly without warrant and their pro- 
ductions too entirely without justification. Not 



Lowell, but " Josh Billings," is their model 
and Great Example. 

No discussion of the abuse of dialect that 
should omit the educational view would be ade- 
quate. The corrupting influence that may 
hardly be escaped by adult readers is tenfold 
more serious in its effect upon the growing 
mind. The prevalence of dialect in the papers 
and magazines that provide young people with 
most of their reading puts a new and formid- 
able difficulty in the way of teachers and par- 
ents. Even the books put into our schools as 
models for the guidance of the young the 
school " readers " themselves often contain 
examples of perverted diction that cannot fail 
to exert an evil influence upon the impression- 
able years of childhood. Upon this aspect of 
our subject, we cannot do better than quote 
some pointed observations from a paper by 
Professor Willis Boughton, of Ohio University. 
Mr. Boughton says : 

"For the past decade some of our most popular 
periodicals have been furnishing their readers with a 
weekly or monthly diet of dialect stories. A handful of 
editors have declared that the people want such litera- 
ture, and it is produced. Instead of romances in cul- 
tivated language, we are introduced to most ordinary 
characters who use most ordinary folk lore. The 
Christmas story, Mr. Howells asserts, is written in the 
'Yankee dialect and its Western modifications.' Even 
our verse is corrupted. Notice a stanza reproduced from 
a leading magazine : 

' I 'm been a visitin' 'bout a week 
To ray little cousin's at Nameless Creek, 
An' I 'm got the hives an' a new straw hat 
An' I 'm come back home where my beau lives at.' 
What literature! If the magazine, one of the greatest 
educational factors in our country, will tolerate such 
language ; if you and I read it, and smile at it, and 
quote it, the Cincinnati teacher may be pardoned for the 
use of language that shocked Dr. Rice. To preserve 
the speech of a vanishing people, dialect literature may 
be justified ; but to propagate such language is vicious. 
At school, the teacher may dwell at length upon the 
linguistic beauties of the 'Village Blacksmith'; but on 
Friday afternoon some urchin declaims : 
'The Gobble-uns' 'ill git you 
Ef you don't watch out,' 

and soon all the children in the district are repeating 
his words. Why the offspring of even polite society are 
prone to use bad English need be no longer a matter of 
wonder." 

" To propagate such language is vicious." The 
words are none too strong, and we thank Mr. 
Boughton for them, hoping that the protest he 
raises will be echoed by educators everywhere. 

These are some of the abuses of dialect ; 
what, then, are its uses ? To what fruitful end 
may we divert the effort now worse than wasted 
by the dialect-mongers of our periodical liter- 
ature? By substituting a scientific for an ar- 
tistic purpose, by making a serious study of 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



69 



dialect instead of playing' with it. The facts 
of dialect speech, as distinguished from the in- 
ventions of the newspaper humorist, are of 
great importance to the history of language. 
No more important linguistic work remains to 
be done in this country than that of recording 
the thousands of local variations of our speech 
from what may be called standard English. 
To fix these colloquialisms in time and place, 
to trace them to their origins, to construct 
speech-maps embodying the salient facts of 
popular usage wherever it has distinctive fea- 
tures these are scientific aims of the worthiest. 
Work of this sort is being energetically carried 
on by a constantly-increasing number of ob- 
servers in this country ; but the ranks still call 
for additions, and new-comers will be heartily 
welcomed. As a coordinating agency for such 
scattered contributions to knowledge, the Am- 
erican Dialect Society, founded in 1889, is, 
in a quiet way, establishing important scien- 
tific conclusions. The lay observer is hardly 
competent to make the finer distinctions in 
pronunciation that come within the scope of 
the trained phonetician, but he can be ex- 
tremely useful in the collection of vocabularies. 
The Society asks him to do two things for each 
peculiar word or idiom that comes to his no- 
tice "first, to fix the fact that it occurs in 
dialect usage in a sense differing from standard 
English, and, secondly, to fix the local limits 
of this usage." All such variations from the 
normal "represent just the class of facts on 
which the scientific study of language rests. 
Many of them are survivals from older periods 
of the language ; many new words are formed 
or adopted to meet a real need arising from 
new conditions, and so ultimately gain a place 
in standard English ; and many variations in 
pronunciation illustrate phonetic changes which 
are constantly going on in language develop- 
ment. The philologist needs to know, from 
a more reliable source than the ordinary novel- 
ist furnishes, the exact locality where each word 
or phrase is used (implying, also, a knowledge 
of where it is not used); just what it means to 
those who use it, and what local variations 
there are, if any, in its form and meaning ; just 
when each new word came in or old one went 
out of use." If, perchance, our little sermon 
on the use and abuse of dialect should turn 
even one misguided realist from a grinder-out 
of dialect " copy " for the newspapers into an 
exact observer of local usage for the scientific 
purposes of the Society, it will not have been 
preached in vain. 



TRIBUTES TO MISS ROSSETTL 



Christina Rossetti died on the 29th of December 
not, as the press despatches announced, on the 
31st. The funeral service was held at Christ 
Church on January 2, and the body was interred 
at the Highgate Cemetery. Among the mourners 
were Mr. W. M. Rossetti, his four children (Olivia, 
Mary, Helen, and Arthur), and Mr. Theodore 
Watts. The service included " The Porter watches 
at the gate " and " Lord, grant us grace to mount 
by steps of grace," two of the poet's most familiar 
hymns. 

The English literary press is strikingly unani- 
mous in appreciation of Christina Rossetti's great 
gifts, and in expression of its sense of the loss to 
English literature in her death. " The Literary 
World " writes as follows : 

" Looking to the quality of her poetry, Miss Rossetti 
attained to the level, at least, of Mrs. Browning, which 
means that she has been excelled by no English woman 
poet. The most exquisite sense of music in the choice 
and collocation of words, and an etherealised imagina- 
tion soaring from the sphere of the earthly to that of 
the spiritual, are the characteristics of her poems." 

This passage is from " The Academy " : 
" In perfection of form and melody of words, her 
lyrics are comparable to those of Shelley : they set them- 
selves to mental music as they are being read. No 
poet of the time, not Tennyson or Swinburne though 
their range may be far wider excels her in the mere 
matter of technique. None has such a pure note, such 
a bird-like sweetness." 

"The Athenaeum," after grouping Christina Ros- 
setti with Walter Pater as the two greatest English 
writers of those who have died during the year, says 
of her that she 

" Was not merely the greatest poet among English- 
women of our day, she was a writer who can be classed 
with all but the very greatest poets of the century. 
Her art was of that admirable kind which conceals the 
process of art ; never was verse so careful to seem care- 
less ; and she was not less remarkable for the passionate 
intensity of her emotion generally religious emotion 
than for the intense simplicity of its expression." 

And "The Saturday Review" begins its long and 
sympathetic editorial article with the following : 

" By the death of Christina Rossetti, literature, and 
not English literature alone, loses the one great modern 
poetess. There is another English poetess, indeed, who 
has gained a wider fame; but the fame of Mrs. Brown- 
ing, like that of her contemporary, and, one might al- 
most say, companion, George Sand, was of too immedi- 
ate and temporary a kind to last. The very feminine, 
very emotional, work of Mrs. Browning, which was 
really, in the last or first result, only literature of the 
L. E. L. order carried to its furthest limits, roused a 
sort of womanly enthusiasm, in precisely the same way 
as the equally feminine, equally emotional, work of 
George Sand. In the same way, only in a lesser de- 
gree, all the women who have written charming verse 
and how many there have been in quite recent times I 
have won, and deservedly, a certain reputation as 
poetesses among poetesses. In Miss Rossetti we have 



70 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



a poet among poets, and in Miss Rossetti alone. Con- 
tent to be merely a woman, wise in limiting herself 
within somewhat narrow bounds, she possessed, in union 
with a profoundly emotional nature, a power of ar- 
tistic self-restraint which no other woman who has writ- 
ten in verse has ever shown." 

Even more interesting than the above critical es- 
timates, is the personal sketch contributed by Mr. 
Theodore Watts to " The Athenaeum." Speaking 
of Miss Rossetti's physical sufferings and the forti- 
tude with which she met them, Mr. Watts says : 

" Throughout all her life she was the most notable 
example that our time has produced of the masterful 
power of man's spiritual nature when at its highest to 
conquer in its warfare with earthly conditions, as her 
brother Gabriel's life was the most notable example of 
the struggle of the spiritual nature with the bodily when 
the two are equally equipped. It is the conviction of 
one whose high privilege it was to know her in many a 
passage of sorrow and trial that of all the poets who 
have lived and died within our time, Christina Rossetti 
must have had the noblest soul." 

Of another aspect of her character, we read : 

" Her intimacy with Nature of a different kind alto- 
gether from that of Wordsworth and Tennyson was 
of the kind that I have described on a previous occa- 
sion as Sufeyistic : she loved the beauty of this world, 
but not entirely for itself; she loved it on account of its 
symbols of another world beyond. And yet she was no 
slave to the ascetic side of Christianity. No doubt 
there was mixed with her spiritualism, or perhaps un- 
derlying it, a rich sensuousness that under other circum- 
stances of life would have made itself manifest, and also 
a rare potentiality of deep passion. It is this, indeed, 
which makes the study of her great and noble nature so 
absorbing." 

Mr. Watts singles out " Amor Mundi " as being per- 
haps Miss Rossetti's masterpiece. 

" Here we get a lesson of human life expressed, not 
didactically, but in a concrete form of unsurpassable 
strength, harmony, and concision. Indeed, it may be 
said of her work generally that her strength as an art- 
ist is seen not so much in mastery over the rhythm, or 
even over the verbal texture of poetry, as in the skill 
with which she expresses an allegorical intent by subtle 
suggestion instead of direct preachment." 



THE FUTURE OF THE NEGRO 
IN FICTION. 



For nearly fifty years the negro has occupied a 
place of more or less prominence in American song 
and story, and his future position therein cannot but 
be a matter of interesting conjecture. It was Stephen 
Foster's plantation melodies, more than anything 
else, perhaps, that first showed the negro in his true 
artistic character ; and that whole coterie of songs, 
" Uncle Ned," "O Susanna," Old Folks at Home," 
"Nelly Was a Lady," etc., forms still the most 
unique and vital addition this country has contrib- 
uted to the psalmody of the world. Though not 
the work of a Southern poet, they bore the stamp 
of genuineness upon their face, and carried the ne- 



gro's pathos and humor all over the land. This was 
before Mrs. Stowe furnished the spark that kindled 
into flame the smouldering fires of liberty ; but 
when " Uncle Tom's Cabin " helped to give the 
negro a country, it gave him at the same time a 
" local habitation and a name " in the literature of 
that country. But all was not yet done. It was 
not the suffering side of the slavery question that 
showed the negro in his richest artistic values, not 
tales of the wretchedness and misery of his condi- 
tion that pictured him in his greatest beauty. They 
held him fast-bound within the realm of philan- 
thropy, and the artist found there no high lights. 
It needed the softening touch of a calmer hand to 
show him in his true colors ; and this it remained 
for another generation to furnish. Mr. Thomas 
Nelson Page has collected the distilled sweetness of 
all that is loveliest in the negro character, and held 
it for all time in a chalice of pure gold. He has 
given to us and to the future the old-fashioned 
darkey pure and simple, with his humor, his pathos, 
his self-sacrificing humility, his cultured politeness, 
his noble loyalty ; and like unto him is Mr. Joel 
Chandler Harris's " Uncle Remus," whose name 
has become a household word throughout the length 
and breadth of the land. These two, more than 
any other writers, have struck the key-note of the 
negro's artistic value, and have given him as a vital 
element to literature. They know him and they 
love him, and their pictures are not overdrawn or 
idealized. Messrs. Page and Harris have had a host 
of coadjutors, each one lending a hand to give the 
negro a permanent place in the literature of our 
time, and all combining to perpetuate the memory 
of the sweetest and best of the race. 

But what of the future? The next decade at 
farthest must show us the last of the old-fashioned 
darkey of " bef o' de war," and it is he the pitiful 
remnant of him that we have grown to love and 
revere in fiction. We love him all the more because 
we know his end is fast approaching ; and when he 
is gone, who will take his place? The generation 
that is to come after him, and grow old in our midst 
as he grew old, is not worthy to unloose his shoe 
latchets, and surely can never fill the place in our 
hearts that he holds. 

Freedom brought the negro his God-given birth- 
right, but at the same time it robbed him of his 
greatest beauty, since it lost for him a background 
whereon to show the noblest elements of his char- 
acter. So long as he lives, the negro must possess, 
in a certain degree, artistic merit : his light-hearted 
Bohemian nature will keep this for him as surely 
as the sun shines, for it is the sun that brings it 
about ; but he has lost his finest motif. The black 
" dude " with cane and eyeglass furnishes richer 
material to the caricaturist and the evolutionist than 
to the artist, and the story-teller of the future will 
have no easy task to keep the negro up to his pres- 
ent valuation for readers of fiction.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

LAFAYETTE AND MIRABEAU. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In reply to Professor von Hoist's communication in 
your last issue, taking exceptions to certain passages in 
my review of his " Lectures on the History of the French 
Revolution," I wish to say that my article was not in- 
tended to be a complete review of the Lowell Lectures. 
I preferred, as I prefer in this rejoinder, to consider 
mainly the characters of Lafayette and Mirabeau, which, 
in the Lectures, were contrasted, with what seemed un- 
due exaltation of the one and undue depreciation of the 
other ; of the one, who, says Professor von Sybel, " lost 
forever the dignity which good morals and honesty give " ; 
and of the other, " of proved disinterestedness, of con- 
stant care for the public good, respect for others, au- 
thority of conscience, loyalty, good faith, of motives 
beautiful and pure," whom Taine presents as a type of 
the cultivated and intelligent liberals of 1789 who did 
not submit to Napoleon. (" Regime Moderne," Vol. I., 
p. 74.) 

Professor von Hoist's charge relating to the conduct 
of Lafayette on the 5th and 6th of October, 1789, is 
supported on the authority of the light and frivolous 
Camille Desmoulins. The unsubstantiated opinion of 
Sainte-Beuve, fairest of critics, that this charge against 
Lafayette has been abandoned or disproved, the author 
thinks is not sufficient. I hope there will be nothing 
" surprising " to Professor von Hoist in the opinions of 
the eminent historians whom I now cite in support of 
Sainte-Beuve's opinion. Professor William Smyth says : 
" As Lafayette was one of the first movers of the Revo- 
lution, no proper justice is ever done to his character 
by those who were unfriendly to the Revolution; it must 
therefore be maintained that it is quite clear, from the 
concurring accounts of all writers, that he made every 
possible exertion to prevent this fatal measure, this 
march upon Versailles, and that with an afflicted and 
foreboding heart he accompanied the populace and the 
soldiers to take the chance of moderating and directing, 
as well as he could, a dreadful mass of men whom he 
could no longer control or bring to reason." Count Mont- 
losier, a distinguished conservative leader in the Assem- 
bly, says in his Memoirs : " In the midst of these dis- 
orders I was a witness of the grief of Lafayette," etc. 
(pp. 30-33). Taine (Revolution, Vol. I., pp. 133-136) ; 
Michelet (Vol. I., pp. 376-378); Mignet (Vol. I., pp. 
130-138) ; and Henri Martin (Vol. I., p. 94), give full 
narrations of the facts concerning the 5th and 6th of 
October, confirming the opinion of Sainte-Beuve. Fi- 
nally I quote on this subject the closing sentences of an 
exhaustive note of Thiers (Vol. I., pp. 375-378) : " No 
one, moreover, dared to deny, in the first moments, a 
devotion which was universally recognized. Later, 
party spirit, perceiving the danger of according virtues 
to a constitutionalist, denied the services of Lafayette; 
and then commenced that long calumny of which he has 
not ceased to be the object." Poor Camille ! 

I have not consciously misstated the conclusions of 
the author upon subjects referred to. When he declares, 
with italics, that Mirabeau was a party by himself, and 
knew beforehand that it would be so, and was determined 
that it should be so, he thinks, nevertheless, that he has 
somewhere stated overlooked facts which explain the 
meaning of what he had previously said, and that un- 
biased readers will see the palpable fallacies of my in- 



ference. Let the appeal, then, go to unbiased readers. 
The reminder that Mirabeau did not enter public life 
for the first time in 1789 is unimportant. In his youth 
he served a few months in the army. Just before the 
Revolution, Caloune gave him an obscure employment 
at Berlin, below any grade of rank in the diplomatic 
body. (Lome*nie, Vol. III., p. 648.) 

The author could not well avoid stating damaging 
facts in relation to the character of Mirabeau. The 
question at issue is, whether the vices and venalities of 
Mirabeau explain his failure to win that confidence of 
colleagues which is necessary to a public man. I did 
not, and cannot now, go fully into the matter. Readers 
will examine for themselves Professor von Hoist's ex- 
planation in which he attempts to reduce the charge of 
venality to what is warranted by the facts. Briefly 
stated, they are: That, for generations, public opinion 
considered it a matter of course that anybody who had 
a chance to get money from the king should improve it; 
that Mirabeau was paid for work done and services ren- 
dered (Vol. II., p. 170); that the "salary " he received 
was an incident, and not an end (p. 174); that if the 
accusers of Mirabeau cannot convict him in regard to 
" two questions " what were his promises, and how 
they were kept, it is evident that though his relations 
to the court were surely not altogether free from blame, 
his own opinion of them must in the main be correct 
(p. 179). And to help the reader to reach these start- 
ling conclusions the author states his own opinion, al- 
ready quoted from Vol. II., pp. 180-81. That opinion 
is further sustained by the supposition that it never en- 
tered into the heads of Count Mercy and Count La 
Marck that taking money front Louis XVI. could throw 
the slightest reflection upon Mirabeau (Vol. II., p. 170). 
In the correspondence between Mirabeau and La Marck 
often quoted by Professor von Hoist, confidential letters 
from La Marck to Mercy show the real opinion of La 
Marck in relation to Mirabeau (Vol. II., pp. 282, 283, 
354). On the 6th of December, 1790, Count La Marck 
writes to Count Mercy : " The queen will be more and 
more the object of my entire attention, and I shall seize 
with care all occasions to be useful to her. It is prin- 
cipally in that respect that I continue my relations with 
Mirabeau. What a man he is ! Always upon the point 
of flying into a passion, or losing heart; by turns impru- 
dent from excess of confidence, or cooled by mistrust, 
he is difficult to direct in things which require perse- 
verence and patience. I will fulfil my task to the end, 
Count, although I discover more and more all its diffi- 
culties." (Vol. II., p. 286.) His task was to watch 
Mirabeau and to hold him faithful to the court. Again 
he writes to Count Mercy: "Permit me to tell you 
briefly my present position. I cannot dissimilate that 
it becomes more and more difficult. On one side I have 
to watch every moment the impetuous character of Mir- 
abeau, and to bring him back when he escapes from me, 
or when he escapes from himself. Very passionate, very 
strong for a sudden attack or at a given moment, he is 
often incapable of remaining five days in the same meas- 
ure and direction." (Vol. II., p. 530). The real truth 
seems to be that nobody could fully trust Mirabeau, 
who had " lost forever the dignity which good morals 
and honesty give." 

Evidence of the venality of Mirabeau was found in 
the secret vault of Louis XVI., November 20, 1792. 
Then the judgment of France upon the conduct of Mira- 
beau in his relations to the court was first expressed.

Chicago, January SO, 1895. 

A MURDEROUS TRANSLATOR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It was an honor which the culture of America duly 
appreciated, when, in 1893, one of the most famous of 
contemporary French writers came to our shores and 
visited us in our native haunts. It is a privilege to read 
a description of ourselves as seen by unprejudiced, but 
not unfriendly, eyes. M. Bourget is a decided advance 
over " Max O'Rell " as an accurate and penetrating ob- 
server or, at least, as a describer of what is observed. 
Eminently psychological and analytical, he does not, 
like the latter, deliberately sacrifice truth for effect, and 
whether we think his descriptions just or not, we are 
bound to admit that they are sincere. 

But whether we think M. Bourget just to us, or not, 
no one, I believe, wishes to see injustice done to him. 
And if ever a writer suffered at the hands of his trans- 
lator, it is M. Bourget at the hands of the newspaper 
syndicate that is giving his "Outre-Mer" to the Amer- 
ican public through the medium of the newspaper press. 
Traduttore, traditore, say the Italians. But the trans- 
lator of " Outre-Mer " is more than a traitor he is a 
murderer. No comparison with the original, nor even 
a knowledge of French, is necessary to discover the ex- 
ecrableness of his work. The style, as it comes to us 
in the newspaper, is awkward, dull, and tiresome, and 
these are faults of which M. Bourget is never guilty. 

A comparison with the Original, which is now running 
in " Le Figaro," discloses blunders which ought to put 
to shame any college freshman. Scarcely a dozen con- 
secutive lines can be selected in which mistranslations 
(some of them the most puerile), unwarranted liberties 
with the text, and monstrous atrocities committed upon 
the English language, do not occur. In its best parts it 
is scarcely more than a verbatim transliteration, in which 
the graceful and forceful French idiom, transferred 
bodily to the English, becomes utterly emasculated and 
meaningless. 

A few illustrations, selected at random, will abund- 
antly show what wrong is being done to a great French 
writer and critic. In speaking of the American young 
lady, he says: " Je crois plus sage de reconnaitre que la 
coquetterie n'est pas plus que le reste, chez 1' Ame'ricaine, 
une affaire d'entrainement." This is how the inspired 
translator got it: "I think it safer to recognize that in 
coquetry, no more than in the rest, the American girls 
allow themselves to be carried away." Every paragraph 
is teeming with such meaningless drivel as this, and 
the unthinking reader goes away with the impression 
that it is M. Bourget who writes it. An average fresh- 
man, with one semester's training in French, ought to 
know that faire une experience means " to make an ex- 
periment," not " to undertake an experience"; that a 
complet omnibus is not a "complete omnibus "; and that 
when Bourget says: "Ce que 1'Ame'rique me donnera 
je 1'ignore," he does not mean that he " ignores " what 
America has in store for him. 

The fact is that this translation as a whole is heavy, 
lumbering, and unreadable. And it is especially to be 
deplored, as this charming writer has only too rarely 
been brought within the reach of the non-French-read- 
ing American public. HERMAN S. PIATT.

"NONSENSE VERSES" IN THE SCHOOLROOM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I be permitted to place myself in the publicity 
of your columns on the side of the Chicago parent whose 
views in your issue of January 16 you class as the " cli- 
max of absurdity " ? 

It is of course greatly to be regretted that a Chica- 
goan or anybody else of man or woman's estate should 
remain in ignorance of the delicious nonsense that 
"Lewis Carroll" has written; but are not many of his 
whimsicalities for " grown up " folks rather than for 
children's powers of understanding and appreciation ? 
Their inimitable foolery is calculated, at least in some 
instances, to give sensitive children an erroneous im- 
pression of several facts in natural history, and a hurt- 
ful idea of the principles that make for ethics, long be- 
fore the little folks are old enough to sift out and enjoy 
the fun of the verses. This in itself should be a good 
argument for keeping the nonsense out of school-books, 
and permitting each parent for himself to judge what 
he shall set before and what keep from his little ones. 

The fact that many men and women of exquisite sym- 
pathies were " brought up " on " Mother Goose " does 
not prove anything in favor of the more bloodthirsty or 
more untruthful of those jingles. Loving and wise 
counter-influences made the crooked teachings straight, 
or supplanted them altogether. The people whose in- 
fant feelings were not cruelly lacerated by the " Babes 
in the Wood " tale, for instance, are to be congratulated, 
not held up as examples in favor of treating other little 
folks to the same harrowing yarn. It is a good deal like 
breaking a butterfly upon a wheel to argue against the 
dear old nursery twaddle, and the new nursery twaddle 
of the inimitable "Carroll " order; and nobody wishes 
to argue against it for anybody old enough to under- 
stand its fun and pay no attention to its distortions. 
But much of it is pernicious for babies in the kinder- 
garten and primary stages. Infant impressions, those 
of very young childhood, are among the most lasting we 
ever receive; is it not, then, not only the better part of 
discretion but the whole of valor, and, what is more to 
the point, the whole of tender-hearted parenthood, to 
see to it that, however attenuated the truth may be that is 
taught children, it shall still be truth, or ideality on truth 
lines? DINAH STURGIS.

FROL'DE'S ERASMUS.* 

Whether a new life of Erasmus was espe- 
cially needed or not; whether Mr. Drummond's 
pleasant volumes of a few years since did not suf- 
ficiently cover the ground for the present gen- 
eration ; whether Mr. Froude has given us any 
fresh light on a somewhat difficult and evasive 
personality, these are questions which might 
be discussed at length without perhaps reach- 
ing a very definite conclusion. Severe critics 
might complain that when an Oxford Profes- 
sor, occupying the chair just vacated by a mi- 
nute and exact scholar like Freeman, chooses to 
turn over old and familiar materials and handle 
a well-known and interesting character, we 
may fairly expect some novelty of exposition, 
some side-lights from contemporary history, 
and the unearthing of a new fact or two. It 
looks rather as if Mr. Froude, recognizing that 
his strength lay in other directions, had frankly 
chosen to disappoint all such expectations, and 
content himself with an easier task, the exer- 
cise once more of his marvellous power of vivid 
presentation, and be satisfied, not with col- 
lecting new matter, but simply with setting be- 
fore us the old in a striking arrangement, and 
telling a familiar story as only such accom- 
plished tellers of stories can. It is not light 
from any new quarter that he offers us, it is 
only stronger and more effective light, with 
vivid dramatic contrasts and perhaps a little 
over-emphasis of shadows. This is Mr. Froude's 
weakness as a historian : over-emphasis of light 
and shade. His pictures are brilliant, not with 
diffused daylight, but with the whites and 
blacks of a sketch in charcoal touched with 
chalk, with the dazzle and gloom of electric 
light and shadow on the stage. His method, 
however, is vivid, and the immediate effect is 
striking. He compels attention. He makes 
Erasmus live again, as modern and intelligible 
as Principal Tulloch of St. Andrews or Profes- 
sor Jowett of Balliol. There may have been more 
penetrative and interpretative lives of Eras- 
mus written, but there will hardly be one more 
readable. This is Erasmus as the ordinary 
reader will know him for many a year to come. 
It is impossible not to notice, in this attract- 
ive volume, that tendency to bear on hard upon 
special defects of his hero which so vexed a

friendly public in Mr. Froude's treatment of 
Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle. A biographer may give 
nothing but the truth, yet present that truth 
distorted by disproportion. Mrs. Carlyle seems 
to be always fighting " bugs " and guarding her 
highly-strung husband against crowing cocks 
and cackling hens ; but probably these were 
smaller facts in her life than they appear in the 
biography. And Mr. Carlyle's later years were 
doubtless saddened by a recognition of how 
imperfectly he had valued the wife whom he 
had lost ; yet he had perhaps been less neg- 
lectful than he is pictured for us, and less re- 
morseful than his reiterated wail of penitence 
would lead us to suppose. Probably they lived 
like other married couples of genius, with fre- 
quent jars, yet substantial harmony ; and a wise 
biographer had been careful not to heighten 
the coloring of two such masters of vigorous 
expression as Thomas and Jane Carlyle. Dis- 
proportion becomes distortion. 

And so with Erasmus. It is not a pleasant 
trait in the great scholar that is revealed to us 
in his imperative demands and somewhat shame- 
less entreaties for money. You see the excuses 
for him. You see that scholars who give them- 
selves up to unremunerative labor must some- 
how live, and live at the expense of somebody ; 
that their choice is between the "patron and the 
jail," and that the ugly necessity sometimes is 
forced upon them of pushing their claims rather 
clamorously, of displaying too evidently the 
emptiness of their purses and the insistent crav- 
ings of their stomachs and backs. And it is 
all well enough to give us a letter or two to 
show this not altogether delightful side of the 
social conditions of the time in which Erasmus 
lived, and the readiness of Erasmus to submit 
to them. But a letter or two would suffice. Mr. 
Froude certainly errs in over-pressing the pain- 
ful fact of the beggary of mediaeval scholarship. 
He makes Erasmus so modern, by the vivid- 
ness of his presentation, that he appears as 
shanteless as if he were a sturdy tramp or beg- 
ging letter- writer of our very different day. The 
effect of such reiteration is as if you should 
paint a portrait deep red whose subject blushed 
easily and frequently ; or should describe a cli- 
mate by recording a succession of thunder- 
storms. They doubtless occurred, and were 
perhaps characteristic ; but there was a good 
deal of pleasant weather unmentioned besides. 

Certainly Mr. Froude is a delightful trans- 
lator. The letters of Erasmus in his version 
are like original letters of a master of pithy 
English. They are indeed cleverer in Mr.

Froude's rendering than in the original, for the 
frank compression and condensation which he 
has given them. The epigrams are clearer-cut 
for the omission of redundancies, and they come 
closer together. 'Mr. Froude's treatment is 
something better than justice : it is enrichment 
and benefaction. 

Nothing could have more perfectly the air 
of well-bred ease and happy familiarity than 
Mr. Froude's lectures. He has gained by not 
taking his task too seriously. Where Free- 
man had worried you with conscientious, pains- 
taking, and scrupulous repetition, Mr. Froude 
touches lightly here and there, and glides on 
with a graceful rapidity. He is not a pro- 
fessor over a class of plodding students, 
rather he is an artist conducting a party of 
friends through a great gallery, and now by a 
word and now by a nod or a gesture calling 
their attention to a masterpiece or casually in- 
dicating a failure. We feel in good company 
all the while company not too much in earn- 
est, not taking life too seriously, but highly cul- 
tured and disposed to lavish its pleasantness 
generously. Was it with a foreboding that 
the walk through the historic gallery was for 
the last time ? 

So much for Mr. Froude's part in the vol- 
ume. What now of the greater part furnished 
by Erasmus ? Certainly there are few more 
brilliant letters in literature than those which 
supply the ample material for this life. Eras- 
mus had the eye of an eagle, and the talon of 
an eagle also. His pen was like an etching- 
needle ; his humor and wit the biting acid that 
made the swift sketch permanent upon the 
plate. He saw things as they were, and what 
he saw became alive upon the page. Those 
were not the days of hasty correspondence, of 
notes tossed off in a moment and mailed with 
the ink hardly dry, to escape the waste-basket 
but one day more. A letter then was as well 
worth elaboration as a sonnet or triolet now. 
But if you have sense, wit, humor, and knowl- 
edge of the world, you can elaborate verse or 
prose into a playful perfection that is delicate 
art, but seems careless nature and unconscious 
ease. It is good to have these picturesque and 
lively letters of Erasmus once more brought to 
the surface to illuminate the ever-interesting 
and not yet exhausted scene of the Renaissance 
and the Reformation. As a man of letters, 
Erasmus must ever hold a foremost place with 
Lucian and Clarendon and Voltaire and Lamb 
and Thackeray, for rare painting of character. 

But it is impossible to treat Erasmus as a 



mere man of letters. He was a power and au- 
thority at the time when the great overturn 
of Christendom took place. He was preem- 
inently the scholar and writer of his age, when 
scholarship and literature were just emerging 
from the pedantry of the schoolmen. He lived 
in the day of Leo and of Luther. He saw his 
time with most penetrative insight. He under- 
stood men as few of his contemporaries under- 
stood them, as scholars rarely understand them. 
He detected the flaws in Luther's method, and 
the shames in the old order into which he and 
Luther alike had been born. There was no 
corruption of the Church which he had not 
scourged with a whip of small cords. He was 
seventeen years older than Luther. Why did 
he not take the lead and do the work of Luther 
more wisely and not less thoroughly ? As we 
see the divisions and distractions which have 
followed upon the Reformation, we are disposed 
sometimes to ask angrily and impatiently, 
Might not Erasmus have made Luther unnec- 
essary ? Might he not have led a reform in the 
Church which should not have precipitated a 
schism ? Were it not good to-day if Christen- 
dom had never been rent as by an earthquake ; 
if a process of gradual enlightenment and piece- 
meal reform had been begun with Erasmus at 
its head ? 

Men have the defects of their qualities, our 
French friends say. The judicial temperament 
is not what you want in an advocate. The 
president of a peace association is not the 
precise stuff for a commander-in-chief. Ever 
since the days of the Reformation, men have 
complained of Erasmus for not being Luther. 
As well complain of an electric light, with its 
fine fibre all a-tingle and a-quiver within its film 
of glass, for not being a roaring fire on the 
hearth. Erasmus had his office ; Luther his. 
Erasmus was a search-light, flinging its pierc- 
ing ray into all the dark corners of Christen- 
dom and pitilessly revealing every sin and 
shame. Come down, O electrician, from your 
secret tower, and build us a blaze that shall 
consume these foulnesses which soar above us 
and make the air noisome for honest men to 
breathe. I cannot come down, is the answer. 
My business is to give light and direct its rays 
where they are needed. I am busy devising 
methods for shedding clearer and fuller light. 
And I have grown to feel that with light 
enough on the lives and the things they will 
shrivel of themselves. Anybody will fetch you 
a firebrand and set the foul heaps in a blaze. 
And I must see to it also that the hasty fires

do not consume these endless precious things 
which my search-light reveals to me under and 
behind the rubbish heaps. 

After all, if Luther gave the world his doc- 
trine of justification, if he brought St. Paul 
once more to the front and gave us the free- 
dom of faith, the fearlessness of Christ, Eras- 
mus restored to the world the New Testament ; 
gave access not to Paul only, but to John and 
Jesus ; he gave us an example of the unbiassed 
spirit that sees the soul of good in things which 
are evil ; he gave us the suggestion of critical 
research ; he was that rare broad churchman 
who can tolerate high churchmen and value 
low churchmen, while impatient of the corrup- 
tion and superstitions of the one and the reck- 
lessness and cant of the other. Conservative 
in action, he was radical in thought. Because 
dreading revolution, he was earnest for reform. 
He loved the unity of Christendom too well to 
lightly cut himself loose from the ancient 
Church of his Fathers. The iconoclastic zeal 
of Luther was foreign to his taste, his temper, 
and his conscience. In many particulars I sus- 
pect what Luther called " dirt " Erasmus called 
" color." He was too clear-sighted to suppose 
that the Church could be tumbled about the 
ears of Christendom without doleful damage to 
truth and soberness, to love and purity. He 
would use a broom and scrubbing brush where 
Luther would use a torch or a battle-axe. Cut 
it down, why cumbereth it the ground ? said 
Luther. Let it alone this year also, said Eras- 
mus : those were the words of Jesus, it must 
be confessed. 

And yet the world is profoundly Luther's 
debtor, and beside his heroic form that of Eras- 
mus seems but pinched and small. The reformer 
of Rotterdam was clear light without heat, keen 
intelligence without moral intensity. Never 
man saw more clearly, but he lacked not man- 
hood, he was brave as a lion ; a more timid 
spirit had chosen his side and stepped behind 
the earthworks of one party or the other ; Eras- 
mus stayed out in the open and took blows on 
either hand, but he lacked wrath and fierce in- 
dignation. His humor qualified and tempered 
and half put out his fire. He discerned the 
evil and was not angry, but petulant and half- 
amused with the wicked every day. He was 
a good scorner, not a good hater. He was the 
scout not the warrior, the detective not the ex- 
ecutioner. To see the evil and expose the evil, 
and delight himself a little in the clearness of 
his vision and the keenness of his dissection, 
and then to feel that his work was done, and 



that it was for others to cart away the rubbish 
and clear up the room, that was Erasmus. 
Intelligence without character may at times be 
invaluable because unprejudiced and judicial, 
but it imperfectly serves its age. It stands back 
in the shadow, or lies out in the offing, when 
the struggle and the storm begin. It would 
like to hate and love more intensely, but these 
things are beyond its power. But it has been 
worth while also only to have seen and said the

THE MOUNTAINS OF CALIFORNIA.* 



A noble book on a noble subject is Mr. John 
Muir's " Mountains of California." A certain 
purity and nobility of expression is found 
therein ; a distinct fitness of style, as if the 
words were evoked and ranged in dignified 
order by the influence of the grandeur of the 
mountains and the beauty and wildness of the 
mountain denizens portrayed. No one in whose 
veins runs a drop of patriotic blood could read 
this story of the mountains without burning 
with pride at the pictures of the natural beau- 
ties of our native land. And the book has 
elements to attract the attention of the lovers 
of each and every form of natural beauty and 
interest. The subjects of the chapters partly 
display the varied aspects shown of mountain 
life : The Sierra Nevada ; The Glaciers ; The 
Snow ; A New View of the High Sierra; The 
Passes ; The Glacier Lakes ; The Glacier 
Meadows ; The Forests ; The Douglas Squir- 
rel ; A Wind Storm in the Forests ; The River 
Floods ; Sierra Thunderstorms ; The Water- 
Ouzel ; The Wild Sheep ; In the Sierra Foot 
Hills ; The Bee Pastures. But the titles alone 
give no hint of the varied wealth of informa- 
tion conveyed. Take the simplest chapter- 
heading " The Snow " of the shortest chap- 
ter. Many of us think we know much of snow ; 
some of us, that we know all about snow ; a few, 
that we know of mountain snow; but to all of 
us the chapter gives new knowledge. It opens 
with a description of the early mountain snows 
and the preparation of the wild mountaineers, 
deer, birds, bears, marmots, and wood rats, for 
the winter. Then we learn, in beautiful crisp 
words, of the wonderful action of snow in the 
forests. Then comes the surprising and strik- 
ing account of the winter burial of the rivers

and small lakes, of the snow bridges and the 
tunnels. Then is given a word-picture of the 
rare and beautiful Snow-banners, part of which 
I quote : 

" The most magnificent storm phenomenon I ever 
saw, surpassing in showy grandeur the most imposing 
effects of clouds, floods, or avalanches, was the peaks of 
the High Sierra, back of the Yosemite Valley, decorated 
with snow-banners. Many of the starry snow flowers, 
out of which these banners are made, fall before they 
are ripe, while most of those that do attain perfect de- 
velopment as six-rayed crystals glint and chafe against 
one another in their fall through the frosty air and are 
broken into fragments. This dry fragmentary snow is 
still further prepared for the formation of banners by 
the action of the wind. For, instead of finding rest at 
once, like the snow which falls into the tranquil depths 
of the forests, it is rolled over and over, beaten against 
rock ridges, and swirled in pits and hollows like boulders, 
pebbles, and sand in the potholes of a river, until finally 
the delicate angles are worn off and the whole mass 
reduced to dust. And whenever storm winds find this 
prepared snow dust on exposed slopes where there is a 
free upward sweep to leeward, it is tossed back into the 
sky and borne onward from peak to peak in the form 
of banners. . . . After being driven into the sky again 
and again it is at length locked fast in bossy drifts, or 
in the womb of glaciers, some of it to remain silent and 
rigid for centuries before it is finally melted and sent 
surging down the mountain sides to the sea. . . . 

" Yet the occurrence of well-formed banners is rare. 
I have seen but one display that seemed perfect. This 
was in 1873 when the summits were swept with a wild 
Norther. . . . When making my way from the valley 
to an overlooking ledge the peaks of the Merced group 
came in sight over the South Dome, each waving a re- 
splendent banner against the blue sky as regular in form 
and as firm in texture as if woven of fine silk. In four 
hours I gained the top of a ridge above the valley, 8000 
feet high, and there in bold relief like a clear painting 
appeared the imposing scene. Innumerable peaks, black 
and sharp, rose grandly into the dark blue sky, their 
bases set in solid white, their sides streaked and splashed 
with snow, like ocean rocks with foam ; and from every 
summit, all free and imconfused, was streaming a beau- 
tiful silky, silvery banner from half a mile to a mile in 
length ; slender at the point of attachment, then widen- 
ing gradually as it extended from the peak, till it was 
a thousand to fifteen hundred feet in breadth; each 
peak with its own refulgent banner, waving with a 
clearly visible motion in the sunglow, and not a single 
cloud in the sky to mar their simple grandeur. 

" In the foreground of your picture rises a majestic 
forest of Silver Fir blooming in eternal freshness, the 
foliage yellow-green, and the snow beneath the trees 
strewn with their beautiful plumes, plucked by the 
wind. . . . Mark how grandly the banners wave as the 
wind is deflected against their sides; how trimly each is 
attached to the very summit of its peak, like a streamer 
at a masthead ; how smooth and silky they are in texture, 
and how finely their fading fringes are penciled on the 
azure sky. See how dense and opaque they are at the 
point of attachment, and how filmy and translucent 
toward the end, so that the peaks back of them are seen 
dimly, as though looking through ground glass. Ob- 
serve how the banners belonging to the loftiest summits 
stream free across intervening notches and passes. 



And consider how every particle of this wondrous cloth 
of snow is flashing out jets of light." 

The main causes of the beauty of this dis- 
play of snow banners were, first, the favorable 
direction of the wind no south wind ever 
flaunts a perfect snow banner ; second, the 
great abundance at that time of unconfined 
snow dust ; third, the peculiar conformation of 
the slopes of the peaks. In general, the south 
sides are convex, while the north sides are con- 
cave, and the wind ascending those concave 
curves converges toward the summit, carrying 
the snow up with it, from whence it floats out 
in horizontal banners. The difference in form 
between the north and south slopes was pro- 
duced by the difference in glaciation to which 
they were subjected. The north sides were 
hollowed by residual shadow-glaciers that never 
existed on southern sun-beaten slopes. Thus 
do shadows determine the forms of these lofty 
mountains, and also of the snow banners which 
the wild winds hang on them. 

There is no doubt that the average reader 
for pleasure, or even for information, unless of 
scientific bent, looks somewhat askance at a 
chapter on glaciers ; but no one will skip Mr. 
Muir's fascinating chapters on glaciers, glacier 
lakes, and glacier meadows. Previous to 1871 
the California glaciers were unknown. That 
year Mr. Muir discovered the Black Mountain 
Glacier of the Sierra, and since then many 
others. The charming glacier lakes are many 
in number over fifteen hundred. There are 
traces of many more that now are vanished 
with the glaciers that gave them birth. The 
largest is Lake Tahoe, twenty-two miles long 
by ten miles wide. The story of their birth and 
growth reads like a prose poem. They contain 
110 fish, but plenty of frogs and larvae of in- 
sects and beetles. Humming wings glance 
over them, robins and grosbeaks feed on the 
berries of their borders, ouzels sing love-songs 
over them ; beautiful fringes of flowers nod 
over these little byworlds of lives for the na- 
turalist. A special beauty, which Mr. Muir 
notes, of the glacier meadows, is the smooth, 
silky lawn of their surface, enamelled with 
flowers, never ragged or unkempt, but per- 
fectly kept and adjusted. He says it produces 
in the beholder such a deep summer joy that 
the mind is fertilized and stimulated by the 
sight, just like a sun-fed plant. 

Mr. Muir gives one chapter to the Douglas 
squirrel. We are thus made acquainted with 
him : 

" He threads the tasseled branches of the pines, stir-

ring their needles like a rustling breeze; now shooting 
across openings in arrowy lines, now launching in curves, 
glinting deftly from side to side in siidden zigzags, and 
swirling in giddy loops and spirals round the knotty 
trunks; getting into what seems to be the most impos- 
sible situations without sense of danger ; now on his 
haunches, now on his head; yet' punctuating his most 
irrepressible outbursts of energy with little dots and 
dashes of perfect repose. He is, without exception, the 
wildest animal I ever saw a fiery, sputtering little bolt 
of life, luxuriating in quick oxygen and the woods' best 
juices. One can hardly think of such a creature being 
dependent, like the rest of us, on climate and food. 
But after all, it requires no long acquaintance to learn 
he is human, for he works for a living. His busiest 
time is in the Indian Summer. Then he gathers burs 
and hazel-nuts like a plodding farmer, working con- 
tinuously every day for hours ; saying not a word ; cut- 
ting off the ripe cones at the top of his speed, as if 
employed by the job, and examining every branch in 
regular order, as if careful that not one should escape 
him; then, descending, he stores them away beneath 
logs and stumps, in anticipation of the pinching hunger- 
days of winter. He seems himself a kind of coniferous 
fruit, both fruit and flower. The resin essences of 
the pine pervade every pore of his body, and eating his 
flesh is like chewing pine gum." 

The water-ouzel, most fascinating singer and 
interesting actor, also has a chapter full of 
interest and beautiful description. 

Perhaps the most marked characteristic of 
the book is the intense love shown by the au- 
thor for all forms and aspects of nature. The 
trees are his brothers ; he knows their forms, 
their voices, the different sounds of their rust- 
ling leaves, he reads their soul ; the birds and 
beasts are his friends, how he delineates their 
features ! the flowers are his sweethearts ; he 
can never cease telling their endearing traits. 
Of the mountains he speaks his love with no 
uncertain voice : 

" To the timid traveler fresh from the sedimentary 
levels of the lowlands, they seem terribly forbidding; 
but though hard to travel, none are safer. For they 
lead to regions that lie far above the ordinary haunts of 
the devil, of the pestilence that walks in the darkness. 
Accidents in the mountains are less common than in the 
lowlands, and these mountain mansions are decent, de- 
lightful, even divine places to die in, compared with the 
doleful chambers of civilization. Fear not to try the 
mountain passes. They will kill care, save you from 
deadly apathy, set you free, call forth every faculty into 
vigorous enthusiastic action." 

The book is wholly self-forgetful, in that 
respect a keen contrast to the self-conscious 
nature-studies of Thoreau. It is almost man- 
forgetful, though occasional bits of descrip- 
tion appear, like this humorous account of the 
furred Mono Indians : 

" Suddenly, as I was gazing eagerly about me, a drove 
of gray hairy beings came in sight, lumbering toward 
me with a kind of boneless, wallowing motion like bears. 
Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that, although 



as hairy as bears, and as crooked as summit pines, the 
strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our 
own species. They proved to be nothing more than 
Mono Indians dressed in the skin of sage rabbits. They 
were mostly ugly, and some of them altogether hideous. 
The dirt on their faces was fairly stratified, and seemed 
so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a 
geological significance. The older faces were, more- 
over, strangely blurred and divided into sections by fur- 
rows that looked like the cleavage - joints of rocks, 
suggesting exposure on the mountains in a cast-away 
condition for ages." 

The picture of the old miners in their exag- 
gerated dotage, and the collections which they 
had gathered like wood-rats, shows deep human 
interest and pathos. 

I do not like to end the reviewing of this 
book, any more than I like to close its pages, 
over which I linger, longing to quote the fine 
thoughts, the fair and symmetrical sentences I 
ever find ; to give the noble expression of the 
sublimity and power of the winds, told in that 
fairly passionate chapter, " A Wind Storm in 
the Forest"; to tell the revealed meaning of the 
gestures of the trees ; to recount the wonder- 
ful, almost incredible, story of the beautiful, 
brave wild sheep, the analytical study and his- 
tory of the giant sequoias, the picture of the 
hanging gardens with larkspurs eight feet high, 
and that final revel in sweetness, the chapter on 
bee pastures, those flowery wildernesses whose 
gladsome praise in melodious phrase makes a 
picture sweeter than that of honied Hybla, 
rosier than that of heathery Hymettus.

THE TECHNIQUE OF THE DRAMA.* 

Gustav Freytag's " Technik des Dramas " 
has long been a standard work in Germany, 
and the announcement that an English transla- 
tion was about to appear was doubtless received 
with pleasure by all who are acquainted with 
the excellence of the original. The book is, in 
fact, one of the few works that are no sooner 
made accessible than they become indispensable. 

Freytag is eminently qualified to speak with 
authority on the subject here treated. With 
a thorough knowledge of the ancient drama, 
as well as of the dramatic literature of the 
principal modern languages, he combines the 
practical training of the successful playwright 
and a perfect acquaintance with the require- 
ments of the stage. As a result, the tone of

[Feb. 1, 



the book he has produced is admirably prac- 
tical and objective. The author has avoided 
all subjective theorizing. He offers no treatise 
on aesthetics, no original ideas on the philosophy 
of art. Feeling, as he says, that such treatises 
usually leave the young author in the lurch 
just where his real difficulties begin, he has 
here given, for the guidance of his successors, 
the results of his own experience, the lessons 
taught by long years of authorship, with the 
usual alternation of failure and success. 

The book is primarily addressed to young 
authors with dramatic aspirations, intended to 
point out to them the best path to the temple 
of fame, and to warn them against the many 
pitfalls along the way. But it appeals also to 
another and far wider circle of readers. The 
discussion of the rules of dramatic composition 
is so sane and judicious, the analyses of dra- 
matic masterpieces, both ancient and modern, 
are so skilful, the criticism is so straightfor- 
ward, that the book cannot fail to be interesting 
and valuable to any student of the drama. In a 
book written for a German public, it is natural 
that a large part of the illustrations should be 
chosen from the works of Lessing, Goethe, and 
Schiller. And yet Shakespeare, who has been 
so thoroughly naturalized in Germany that he 
is almost looked upon as a German classic, re- 
ceives perhaps more attention than any other 
author ; and a considerable place is given also 
to the Greek drama, especially to Sophokles. 

The body of the " Technique " is divided 
into four chapters, dealing respectively with 
Dramatic Action, the Structure of the Drama, 
the Structure of the Scenes, and the Characters. 
In the opening chapter the author discusses first 
the development of the " dramatic idea " from 
the raw material offered by history, litera- 
ture, or contemporary event. To the question, 
" What is dramatic ? " the answer is, " Neither 
an act per se, nor an emotion per se, but only 
passion that leads to action, and events as they 
influence the human soul." The discussion of 
the difference between a " dramatic person " 
and the flesh-and-blood reality is interesting, 
and may be recommended especially to the at- 
tention of the " Veritist." After an excellent 
exposition of the law of Unity, the author dis- 
cusses in turn the necessity of probability and 
importance in the action, dramatic movement 
and climax, and the nature of the tragic. 

In the second chapter the author considers, 
in its various aspects, the structure of the drama 
as a whole ; thus, he discusses " action " and 
" reaction," the rise, climax, and fall of the 



action, the division into five acts, with the in- 
fluences that produced this division, and its 
technical justification. The larger part of this 
chapter, however, is devoted to a thorough 
analysis of the origin and structure of the 
Greek drama, as exemplified in the works of 
Sophokles, followed by a similar study of the 
Germanic drama, with illustrations from Shake- 
speare. The third chapter continues the sub- 
ject of structure, with a discussion of the scene, 
as the practical unit of action, determined by 
the technical demands of the stage, and demand- 
ing of the author a skilful arrangement of mo- 
tifs within the limits of each such unit. 

In the exhaustive discussion of the charac- 
ters of the drama, Freytag points out their de- 
pendence on national characteristics and on the 
personality of the author, as well as on the ac- 
tion in which they are involved. The various 
sources of the action are fully treated, and the 
attitude of the dramatist toward his subject- 
matter is defined ; a number of practical rules 
follow, on the unity of the characters, their 
comparative importance and mutual relations, 
the perspicuity of the action, and miscellaneous 
topics of importance to the playwright. Two 
brief chapters follow, dealing with externals ; 
the fifth is devoted to a discussion of dramatic 
style and of the relative merits of prose and of 
various metrical forms as the vehicle of dra- 
matic expression ; the sixth, entitled " The Au- 
thor and his Work," contains a number of prac- 
tical hints of value to the dramatic writer in 
his workshop, and not without interest even to 
the general reader. 

In view of the excellence and importance 
of Freytag's work, it is unfortunate that the 
English translation should fall so far short, as 
it does, of offering a satisfactory reproduction. 
Translation is no easy task at best, and the 
translator is pretty sure to find himself beset by 
many difficulties, whether he adopt the literal 
or the idiomatic method. And yet it is possi- 
ble, by either method, to reproduce with toler- 
able accuracy at least the ideas of the original. 
The present translation, however, seems to com- 
bine all the disadvantages of both methods, 
without exhibiting any of their redeeming 
merits. The style of the translation, as En- 
glish, is execrable ; and at the same time hardly 
a page is free from more or less atrocious mis- 
translations, so that often the sense of the origi- 
nal is garbled beyond recognition. Let the 
reader judge for himself from a few typical ex- 
amples : 

"Alas, poetics has come down to us incomplete" (p. 5).

" Next after the struggles of the leading characters, 
the judgment of contemporaries, as a rule, or at least 
that of the immediately following time, prizes the sig- 
nificance of a piece" (p. 27). 

" This internal consistency is produced by represent- 
ing an event which follows another, as an effect of which 
that other is the evident cause. Let that which occa- 
sions, be the logical cause of occurrences, and the new 
scenes and events will be conceived as probable, and 
generally understood results of previous actions. Or 
let that which is to produce an effect, be a generally 
comprehensible peculiarity of a character already made 
known "(p. 29). 

"For when young Protestantism had laid the se- 
verest struggles in men's consciences, and when the 
thoughts and the most passionate moods of the excited 
soul had been already more carefully and critically ob- 
served by individuals, the mode of conception natural 
to the middle ages, had not, for that reason, yet disap- 
peared " (p. 59). 

Such nonsense as this (and similar passages 
could be quoted ad infinitum) is hardly calcu- 
lated to inspire the reader with admiration for 
the author's mental or literary equipment. But 
in each of these cases, what Freytag really says 
is perfectly sane, and correctly expressed as 
well. 

Often the mistranslations of shorter passages 
are so grotesque that they become comical. 
Thus, we have the amusing statement that 
Shakespeare " created the drama of the earlier 
Teutons," where the original merely says that 
he was the first great dramatist of the Ger- 
manic race ; the reference to " laws of crea- 
tion," instead of laws of dramatic composition ; 
the reference to the " deepening of mind and 
spirit produced through the sixteenth century, 
not only among the Germans, but also among 
the Romans," where the original of course re- 
fers to the Germanic and Romance nations. 

Enough has been said to show that the trans- 
lation is inadequate and often misleading, and 
that the reader will need to be constantly on 
his guard in using it. Even in this form, the 
book will be useful, for it supplies a need for 
which there seems to be no other provision in 
the English language ; but it is deplorable in- 
deed that its usefulness should be seriously im- 
paired by the worse than indifferent quality of 
the translation. The publishers have done their 
part admirably ; they have produced a hand- 
some volume, with irreproachable typography, 
and few misprints. J OHN g> NOLLEN>

MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRIC ACTIOX.* 

A full account of the experimental investi- 
gations which made the late Professor Hertz 
the best known among the younger German 
physicists is given in his interesting volume en- 
titled, " Electric Waves," which well merits the 
English translation recently published. When 
the papers of Hertz first appeared they created 
a profound sensation among the most advanced 
physicists. No work in physics in many years 
has attracted the attention of scientific men to 
such a degree. His apparatus was so simple, 
his methods so easily followed, and the results 
so striking, that all recognized the appearance 
of a star of the first magnitude. 

Though the modern theory of electricity, as 
originated by Faraday, had been expanded and 
reduced to a mathematical system by the la- 
mented Maxwell, yet twenty-five years had 
elapsed before Hertz, by his famous experi- 
ments " On the Propagation of Electric Action 
with Finite Velocity Through Space," con- 
vinced the scientific world of the superiority of 
Maxwell's theory over the older views. All of 
his researches are of recent date ; the first was 
made in 1886, and the others followed in quick 
succession. The interest excited caused a great 
number of applications to be made for the 
papers in which the researches were published. 
Since it was impossible to comply with all these 
requests, Hertz decided to have them reprinted 
without change, but to add as an introduction 
a summary of his work, giving the history of 
his experiments, and stating his final theoreti- 
cal views on the subject. He moreover added 
supplementary notes, because some of the opin- 
ions expressed in the account of his earlier in- 
vestigations had changed. These notes contain, 
in addition, an account of results arrived at by 
other investigators who undertook similar ex- 
periments later. 

The series of papers in the present volume 
consists of fourteen numbers, of which the third 
is an extract from a paper by von Bezold, who 
as early as 1870 observed electric waves and 
their interference. His results are practically 
the same as those arrived at by Hertz in his 
earlier investigations. The first part of the 
book contains a description of Hertz's exciter, 
by which very rapid electric oscillations or 
waves are produced ; and of his receiver, or

secondary coil, by means of which he investi- 
gated their action. He follows these waves 
along conductors, studies the interference of 
direct and reflected waves, determines their ve- 
locity of propagation, etc. 

Perhaps the most interesting number of the 
series is the eleventh, originally published in 
1888, " On Electric Radiation." Hertz pro- 
duces rays of electricity, and proves that they 
are propagated in straight lines ; he polarizes 
these rays, reflects them by appropriate mir- 
rors, shows that they can be refracted, deter- 
mines the index of refraction for the refracting 
medium, in short, performs all the experi- 
ments with which we are familiar in the study 
of light. Hence electric waves belong to the 
same category of ether vibrations as light and 
heat waves ; or, as he himself says, " we might 
designate the rays of electric force as rays of 
light of very great wave length." The volume 
closes with two papers containing a mathemati- 
cal treatment of the phenomena. The English 
title of " Electric Waves " was suggested by 
Lord Kelvin (Sir William Thomson). He also 
wrote the preface to the English edition, giving 
a short outline of the development of modern 
theories of electric action. 

It is interesting at this time to note that 
Hertz began his studies, which led to such re- 
markable results, on account of a problem pro- 
posed to him some fourteen years since by Pro- 
fessor von Helmholtz, who has so recently died. 
The writer well remembers Hertz about that 
time as the second assistant in von Helmholtz's 
laboratory. Hertz's work has recalled atten- 
tion to the remarkable researches of our own 
Joseph Henry, which, as Lord Kelvin has truly 
said, " came more nearly to an experimental 
demonstration of electro-magnetic waves than 
anything that had been done previously." 

We now have, as a result of Hertz's work, 
one ether for heat, light, electricity, and mag- 
netism ; and this volume, containing Hertz's 
electrical papers, will be a permanent record 
of the splendid consummation now realized.

THAT " The Saturday Review," while changing its

THE PHILOSOPHIC RENASCENCE IN 
AMERICA.* 



The nine books lying before me are an interest- 
ing sign of the times. Drifting together from va- 
rious quarters, and finally tied up in one packet and 
calling for notice in one review, they present at 
once an extraordinary diversity and an extraordin- 
ary unity. The diversity is in the various methods 
of approach to philosophy which they represent in 
contemporary thought ; the unity is in a certain un- 
derlying trend and aim which, disguised by differ- 
ences in terminology and of school attachment, is 
none the less real and assured even though some 
of the authors represented might horroresce at the 
thought of kinship with some of the others. It ac- 
cordingly seems better worth while for the nonce to 
take this casual collection of books as an index of 
the present direction of thought, than to subject 
each severally to an exhaustive analysis. 

At the outset the collection is characteristic in 
this : it has within it five books by American writers, 
including one by a thinker of German birth, but 
now at home in America and conducting two of its 
most thoughtful periodicals ; it has within it two 
translations from the German, and one from the 
French, and one book by a German acclimated in 
England rather than in the United States. It does 
not take a very long look backward to realize the 
significance of the possibility of any such collection. 
It marks at once the extent to which English and 
American thought is breaking loose from its long- 
time local prepossessions and insulation, and is en- 
deavoring to assimilate the thought of continental 
Europe ; and it marks also the vigor of the philo- 
sophic renascence for such we may fairly term it 
in the United States. Add to this that one of the 
books ( Professor Miiller's ) deals expressly with an 
old philosophy of India, while another (Dr. Deus- 
sen's) is pretty well saturated with the same Ve- 
dantic lore, though attempting to adjust it (via

Schopenhauer) more closely to modern thought, and 
we see that the existing ferment of thought is cos- 
mopolitan. 

An equal variety meets us if we attempt to class- 
ify the books from the standpoint of their subject 
matter. The collection is not fairly representative 
on the ethical side, but apart from that it contains 
four books which deal expressly with constructive 
philosophical work, three with psychological in- 
quiry, while Professor Miiller and Dr. Deussen 
again stand for that craving for something beyond 
either the rationally philosophical or the experi- 
mentally demonstrable which is so marked a 
feature of the present ; for though we may conven- 
tionally ignore the matter, yet occultism and Orien- 
talism in one form or another are most emphasized 
traits of the existing popular consciousness. 

Of the translations, not much need be said. The 
Bibot has so long been familiar to students of psy- 
chology that it is only necessary to welcome its 
appearance in English, and express thanks to the 
translator for his satisfactory work ; indeed, all of 
the translations issuing from the "Open Court" 
press reach a satisfactory standard of workmanship. 
Mr. Wallace has been known for years by his trans- 
lation of Hegel's " Logic," and his attempt with the 
" Philosophic des Geistes " is equally successful, 
while it will introduce Hegel to many in a new as- 
pect as among other things a psychologist, and, 
according to his lights and the state of knowledge 
when he wrote, a physiological psychologist. Mr. 
Wallace's introductory essays are suggestive, in- 
genious, and literary ; they represent that phase of 
the Oxford philosophical tradition which delights in 
philosophy for its culture value ( to use the current 
cant phrase), and sits very easily to its severer and 
more scientific sides the tradition which found its 
culmination in Jowett's introductions to the Platonic 
dialogues. Mr. Wallace is more serious and thor- 
ough-going in his methods than Jowett was ; but 
there is the same occasional complete inconsequence, 
the same occasional sacrifice of ideas to the needs of 
clever statement, and the same undercurrent of feel- 
ing that it is hardly worthy of an English gentleman 
and scholar to be too anxious about definiteness and 
precision in thought. Mr. Wallace has probably 
carried the art of translating Hegel as far as it can 
be carried upon present methods. It is quite pos- 
sible that a translator may sometime arise who will 
give up the attempt to find technical terminology to 
correspond to .Hegel's philosophical dialect, and set 
about doing in English what Hegel himself did in 
German (as Aristotle had done before him in Greek) 
hunting up pregnant words of idiomatic speech, 
and squeezing the philosophic meaning out of them. 
As for Dr. Deussen's work, what shall we say? 
The translation is well done ; but was the original 
worth translating? The form is largely a quasi 
geometrical method ; definitions abound, which, like 
all philosophic definitions that precede, instead of 
summing up discussion, beg the question ; disjunc- 



tions, which ingeniously conceal the problem while 
appearing to simplify it, are numerous. And 
through it all is the gospel of the Vedanta, with 
Schopenhauer as its prophet and expounder. Those 
who already know their Spinoza and Kant and 
Schopenhauer will hardly get much out of the book ; 
those who want a philosophy not for philosophic 
but for aesthetic and emotional purposes may easily 
turn from, say, theosophy to Dr. Deussen's con- 
structions of the universe. Speaking of the Indian 
philosophy brings me to Professor Miiller's book, 
which, like all his recent work, is pedantically pop- 
ular in style, written largely, if not ad captandum, 
at least ad audiendum, and yet manages to convey 
in a wonderfully easy way a large amount of useful 
information to him who can separate that informa- 
tion from its graceful entwinings with Mr. Miiller's 
own opinions and feelings about a great variety of 
subjects. 

Mr. Van Norden's title, " The Psychic Factor," 
covers an attempt to state the more elementary facts 
of psychology with especial reference to many of 
the more recent biological investigations, and with 
some emphasis on the phenomena of dreams, hyp- 
notism, etc. Mr. Van Norden is a long way from 
being a systematic thinker, but he has a keen eye 
for salient facts, and a power of lucid expression. 
His book may serve as a popular summary of many 
of the points of chief interest in current psychology. 
Mr. Nichols gives the method and results of the 
application of experimental psychology to the prob- 
lems of number and space. The work is really a 
laboratory monograph, and will appeal to the spe- 
cialist. It is symptomatic of the courage and energy 
of the modern psychologist, that he completely ig- 
nores the attempt of the metaphysician to shut off 
a little inclosure of concepts, like number and space, 
warning all experimental methods to keep off. Mr. 
Nichols's treatise on " Notions of Number and 
Space " shows that experimental methods may be 
applied with some hope of fruit to the " metaphys- 
ical " categories, but strikes me as suggestive rather 
than as conclusive. The book in form has a way 
irritating to me of stating on one side a high 
general and vague conclusion, and then one hundred 
and nine very specific conclusions, but with none of 
the media axiomata which are most helpful to other 
workers. 

There are left for consideration three attempts 
to deal constructively with philosophy. Mr. Ormond, 
in his " Basal Concepts in Philosophy," attempts the 
deepest flight. He takes up seriously and earnestly 
the problem of the relation of God to the finite 
world, and hopes to add something to its solution 
by a reconstruction of the triad of Hegelian cate- 
gories of Being, Non-Being, and Becoming, through 
a conception of Non-Being as that which the Abso- 
lute Being or Spirit continually wars against and 
suppresses, but which never, as it does in Hegel- 
ianism, becomes a moment of Being. It is obvi- 
ously out of the question to discuss Mr. Ormond's

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



argument in a brief review, but I cannot refrain 
from pointing out two things. One is that, to many, 
Mr. Ormond's entire problem will seem self-made, 
factitious. This problem is, how an absolute can 
give rise to a finite, the perfect to an imperfect. 
There will be many who will want to know whence 
Mr. Ormond gets his definition of an absolute, and 
his standard of perfection ; who will inquire, what 
is the ground of the assumption that the absolute 
is absolute apart from what he terms the " finite," 
and how Mr. Ormond is so certain of the nature of 
perfection as to assume, without discussion, that 
" perfection " can get along without having as fac- 
tors of itself those things which Mr. Ormond labels 
imperfection. There are some who prefer a world 
with night as well as day, of pain as well as pleas- 
ure, of temptation as well as of a goodness which 
to them would seem tedious without the struggle of 
conquest. This may be very poor taste on their 
part, but it represents a standpoint which is not 
so much rejected as ignored by Mr. Ormond. My 
other remark is that to many Mr. Ormond's solu- 
tion of the problem of evil will appear in unstable 
equilibrium between what he would term, I suppose, 
a pantheistic optimism or monism, and the old-fash- 
ioned orthodox dualism of personal God and per- 
sonal Devil. The mind can formally follow the 
idea of an Absolute Being which in thinking itself 
has to exclude all taint of Non-Being, and so keeps 
up at once the thought of Non-Being, and the war- 
fare to exclude it. But the mind will have a feeling 
that a genuine Absolute would not have to spend 
time in contending with what, after all, is but its 
own shadow. I do not wish to seem to deal flip- 
pantly with a serious effort to think out a funda- 
mental problem, but one can hardly escape the 
conclusion that Mr. Ormond's Absolute is engaged 
in setting up a man of straw, and then never quite 
knocking the straw man down, because in that case 
it would lose this negative exercise of exclusion 
through which it maintains its own positive identity. 
Mr. Ormond does not appear to realize how essen- 
tially one his position is with that of Fichte. 

Mr. Hill's " Genetic Philosophy" deals amiably 
and readably with a large number of questions of 
genesis and evolution, bringing to bear upon prob- 
lems of the origin of life, feeling, consciousness, art, 
morality, etc., a considerable range of reading, and 
an easy style. Unfortunately, the book is marred 
by a certain pretentiousness, manifest even in its 
title. The work is in no sense itself a philosophy of 
genesis, or genetic in the sense of using a thorough- 
going evolutionary method. It simply discusses 
lucidly and with considerable discrimination certain 
specific genetic questions. The claim is even more 
emphatic and offensive in the introduction, where 
the book is offered as affording a way out of exist- 
ing philosophic confusion. 

Mr. Carus in his "Primer of Philosophy" has put 
before us in a thoughtful, yet easily grasped form, 
an attempt to combine the data and methods of 



modern science with certain metaphysical concepts, 
resulting, as he says, in a reconciliation of philo- 
sophies of the types of Mill's empiricism and Kant's 
apriorism. This spirit of synthesis and media- 
tion is prominent throughout the book, which is 
thoroughly worth reading and study. It is doubt- 
ful, however, if it will fulfil the pious wish of the 
author and set the stranded ship of philosophy 
afloat again; indeed, were the ship of philosophy 
stranded, I doubt the ability of the united efforts of 
the whole race to get it afloat. It is wiser to think 
of the ship of philosophy as always afloat, but al- 
ways needing, not, indeed, the impetus of any in- 
dividual thinker, but the added sense of direction 
which the individual can give by some further, how- 
ever slight, interpretation of the world about.

RECENT AMERICAN POETRY.* 



There comes to the life of most poets a period 
when poetic inspiration flags, when the thought no 
longer finds free and almost spontaneous expression 
in rhythmical numbers, but needs rather to be 
jogged by a striking incident or the flow of emo- 
tion about some theme forcibly brought into contem- 
plation. Under such stimulus, the old poetic energy 
revives, and even produces a fair counterfeit of the 
fluent expression of earlier days. But " the sound 
is forced, the notes are few," and we must accept 
the finer artistic sense that comes with years, and 
the poetic self-consciousness more completely real- 
ized, as the only possible compensations for the les- 
sened volume and momentum of the stream of in- 
spiration. Some such reflections as these must come 
to readers of the new volume of verse which bears 
the name of Mr. Aldrich upon its title-page ; al- 
though the lesson is not so apparent in the case of 
one who has been more or less consciously an artist

throughout his career as it might be in another's. 
The fine heroics upon our national " Unguarded 
Gates " offer a striking illustration of the power 
possessed by a noble theme to quicken into renewed 
flame the failing embers of the poetic fire. 

" Liberty, white Goddess ! is it well 
To leave the gates unguarded ? On thy breast 
Fold Sorrow's children, soothe the hurts of fate, 
Lift the down-trodden, but with hand of steel 
Stay those who to thy sacred portals come 
To waste the gifts of freedom. Have a care 
Lest from thy brow the clustered stars be torn 
And trampled in the dust. For so of old 
The thronging Goth and Vandal trampled Rome, 
And where the temples of the Ctesars stood 
The lean wolf unmolested made her lair." 

The considerable proportion of personal and occa- 
sional poems in the present collection helps to illus- 
trate our introductory thesis. And here again, the 
inspiration being given, we have verses that Mr. 
Aldrich has never surpassed, personal tributes of 
the most heartfelt gratitude conveyed in the most 
polished verse. In a previous review we quoted 
from a volume by Mr. Aldrich his tribute to Ten- 
nyson. Let us upon this occasion quote another, 
written before the Laureate's death, and appropri- 
ately linking his name with that of the greatest 
among his contemporaries. 

" When from the tense chords of that mighty lyre 
The Master's hand, relaxing, falls away, 

And those rich strings are silent for all time, 
Then shall Love pine, and Passion lack her fire, 
And Faith seem voiceless. Man to man shall say, 
' Dead is the last of England's Lords of Rhyme.' 

" Yet stay ! there 's one, a later laureled brow, 
With purple blood of poets in his veins ; 

Him has the Muse claimed ; him might Marlowe own ; 
Greek Sappho's son ! men's praises seek him now. 
Happy the realm where one such voice remains ! 
His the dropt wreath and the unenvied throne. 

" The wreath the world gives, not the mimic wreath 
That chance might make the gift of king or queen. 

finder of undreamed-of harmonies ! 
Since Shelley's lips were hushed by cruel death, 
What lyric voice so sweet as this has been 
Borne to us on the winds from over seas ? " 

The poems inscribed to Lowell, Holmes, and Grant 
should also be mentioned as among the best of the 
volume. In one of his sonnets Mr. Aldrich says : 

" I must have known 
Life otherwhere in epochs long since fled ; 
For in my veins some Orient blood is red, 
And through my thought are lotus blossoms blown," 

and the statement is illustrated by two of those 
Eastern apologues which have been so noteworthy 
a feature of his preceding volumes. And then there 
are sonnets and lyrics and delicate cameo-like quat- 
rains in the new volume, and we may well give 
thanks that a poet is left among us who can do all 
or any of these things as artistically as they are 
done here. 

Ten years ago, writing over the signature of 
" Paul Hermes," Mr. William Roscoe Thayer pub- 
lished a volume of verse entitled " The Confessions 
of Hermes, and Other Poems." He has now gath- 



ered into a volume of " Poems New and Old " the 
best of the earlier pieces, and a much larger num- 
ber of later ones, among the latter being several 
upon Oriental themes. When we reviewed the vol- 
ume of ten years ago [June, 1885] we gave credit 
to the earnest purpose of the writer, but were com- 
pelled to comment somewhat severely upon the tech- 
nical shortcomings of his verse. In spite of a per- 
ceptible advance in his technique, Mr. Thayer's 
verse is still deficient in the true rhythmical quality, 
and is still weighted with prosaic turns and phrases. 
In fact, the very things that we have marked as 
among the best in the new volume turn out to have 
been already published in the older one. Mr. Thayer 
is at his best in such a poem as the sea-shore " Rev- 
erie," from which we now quote : 

" Sweet is it over shelving sands to stroll 
When the victorious tide begins to lose, 
And watch the stubborn-yielding billows roll, 
Or look upon the mid-sea's scudding hues, 
Sweet is it then to loiter and to muse." 

To the mental vision of such a loiterer scenes like 
these appear : 

" Here rise the saucy, unobsequious waves 
To wet the sandals of the Danish King ; 
Here spectral pirates crawl from nameless graves 
And count again their booty, quarreling ; 
And here Pizarro draws the fatal ring. 

" Columbus kneels exultant, and unfurls 
The cognizance of Christ and Ferdinand ; 
Here weeping mothers and bewilder'd girls 
Cry out ' God speed ye ! ' to the Mayflower band, 
Long after sails are hidden from the land. 

" And Bonaparte here reconstructs his doom, 
Reversing Waterloo, or peers afar 
Till Breton cliffs along the horizon loom 
In bitter-sweet mirage ; this sodden spar 
Bore Nelson's duty-sign at Trafalgar." 

Such verse as this, fed by culture and the historical 
consciousness, is always acceptable, although not 
poetry in any high sense. 

" In Sunshine Land " is a collection of verses 
ostensibly for children, but they have a serious 
poetic value, and must be classed with such books 
as Miss Rossetti's " Sing-Song," Marston's "Garden 
Secrets," and Stevenson's " A Child's Garden of 
Verses," all three of which works they at times sug- 
gest. Miss Thomas has exhibited in this volume a 
surprising daintiness of touch and delicacy of feel- 
ing ; a surprising insight, also, into the workings of 
the child mind. Nothing could be lovelier in its 
way than " Sylvia and the Birds," with which the 
volume opens. But no extract could do justice to 
this glorified prattle. We will rather take the close 
of " The Ancient History of the Flowers ": 

" The red Lobelia lit a fire, and flung 
The embers all around a shady dell ; 
The Daisy had a gypsy's crafty tongue, 
And youthful fortunes glibly would she tell ! 

" The Asters were a shower of stars that fell 
Amid the dimness of an autumn night, 
Witch-hazel woke, and cheerily cried, ' All 's well ! ' 
And met with smiles the dull November light."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



"The Young Geologist," more nearly in the sober 
philosophic vein of the author than most of these 
pieces, may also be quoted : 

" Comes one with searching look 
To read the great Stone Book ; 
With youthful brows perplexed, 
He scans the rugged text. 

" The knuckled rock he taps, 
And ancient thunders lapse, 
With deep imagined thud, 
On beaches of the flood. 

" Old summers bud and bloom, 
And sink into a tomb : 
He sees them bloom again 
Upon the hearths of men. 

" Life went with striding pace, 
He hunts upon its trace : 
A track a rib a tooth 
What birds and beasts uncouth ! 

" Youth bends with baffled look, 
Above the great Stone Book ; 
The title-page is dim, 
The Finis not for him." 

Possibly a very young geologist may not see all these 
things, but the poem is very lovely for all that. 

Miss Hazard's " Narragansett Ballads " versify a 
number of incidents of colonial times, including the 
Great Swamp Fight of 1675, and jog along in some 
such fashion as this : 

" Connecticut had sent her men 
With Major Robert Treat ; 
Each Colony in its degree 
Sent in its quota meet." 

The verse is not exactly inspired, and we can hardly 
say more for the " Songs and Lyrics " of the second 
half of the volume, although there are at the close 
some rather pretty pieces upon Californian themes. 
The " Songs from Vagabondia," which Mr. Bliss 
Carman and Mr. Richard Hovey have put forth to- 
gether, are of very unequal quality. Interspersed 
among verses as irregular and reckless as the vaga- 
bond life they celebrate, we find here and there so 
noble a poem as "The Mendicant," or the stanzas 
called "Contemporaries." We quote from the 



former 



" O foolish ones, put by your care ! 
Where wants are many, joys are few; 
And at the wilding springs of peace, 
God keeps an open house for you. 

" But that some Fortunatus' gift 
Is lying there within his hand, 
More costly than a pot of pearls 
His dulness does not understand. 

" And so his creature heart is filled ; 
His shrunken self goes starved away. 
Let him wear brand-new garments still, 
Who has a threadbare soul, I say. 

" But there be others, happier few, 
The vagabondish sons of God, 
Who know the by-ways and the flowers, 
And care not how the world may plod. 

" They idle down the traffic lands, 
And loiter through the woods with spring, 
To them the glory of the earth 
Is but to hear a bluebird sing. 



" They too receive each one his Day ; 
But their wise heart knows many things 
Beyond the sating of Desire, 
Above the dignity of Kings." 

This poem, at least, we do not hesitate to ascribe 
to the lyrist of Grand Pre", however we may doubt 
the authorship of many among the others. And, 
in general, the contents of this volume offer a group- 
ing that a sensitive ear can hardly miss. There are 
poems which are rollicking, and poems which are 
not. And the poems which are not are those which 
are the most pleasing and the most artistic. 

"May one who fought in honor for the South 
Uncovered stand and sing by Lincoln's grave ? " 

asks Mr. Maurice Thompson, at the opening of his 
Phi Beta Kappa poem, read at Harvard a year 
ago. The apologetic question, we should say, needs 
no answer other than the poem itself, which is dig- 
nified, worthy of the subject and occasion, and soars 
to a higher flight than any of which we had thought 
the writer capable. One stanza of the thirty-six 
must suffice to illustrate both the form and the spirit 
of this poem. 

"His was the tireless strength of native truth, 
The might of rugged, untaught earnestness ; 
Deep-freezing poverty made brave his youth, 
And toned his manhood with its winter stress 
Up to the temper of heroic worth, 
And wrought him to a crystal clear and pure, 
To mark how Nature in her highest mood 

Scorns at our pride of birth, 
And ever plants the life that must endure 
In the strong soil of wintry solitude." 

Mr. Cawein has now published five volumes of 
poems, yet the promise of the first volume is but 
imperfectly fulfilled by the last. Some measure of 
restraint has been imposed upon his native exuber- 
ance, but still more is needed ; some approach has 
been made to definiteness of thought, but the inane 
yet remains too largely his element. Nor do we find 
the improvement in finish that so much practice 
ought surely to have brought about. In the long 
title poem, for example, we come upon so unpardon- 
able a solecism as this : 

" Idea, God of Plato ! one 

With beauty, justice, truth, and love : 
Who, type by type, the world begun 
From an ideal world above ! ' ' 

He might as well have written 

"Who, type by type, creation done 
Shape from the ideal world above." 

Vague yearnings and nebulous imaginings form the 
stuff of too many of these pieces. Now and then, 
however, we come upon a pure and simple strain, as 
in these verses from "The Argonauts": 

" Behold ! he sails no earthly barque, 

And on no earthly sea ; 
Adown the years he sails the dark 
Deeps of futurity. 

' ' Ideals are the ships of Greece 

His purpose steers afar ; 
The skies, his seas ; the Golden Fleece 
He seeks, the farthest star."

Of course it is not fair to criticise a lyrical Pegasus 
for preferring cloudland to earth, but it may be sug- 
gested that Pirene \vas, after all, an earthly spring, 
and that from its waters the fabled steed took re- 
newed strength for flight. 

A new-comer in the ranks, Mr. Robert Cameron 
Rogers, has taken poetic inspiration from much the 
same sort of themes as Mr. Cawein from the mys- 
teries of nature and the beauties of classic legend 
but has made of it a more human use. Indeed, 
our prosaic comment upon the importance of keep- 
ing touch with earth might be richly illustrated by 
" The Wind in the Clearing," Mr. Rogers's title- 
poem ; or, better still, replaced by these verses 
called " Theory," having for their text the Virgil- 
ian " Sunt geminae somni portse." 

" She was so beautiful I could but follow ; 

Her words seemed truth itself, I could not doubt, 
And so she led me out beyond the hollow 
Half-hearted living of the world about. 

" Steep though the upward path, without misgiving 

I followed as she led, and more and more 
She grew to seem the guide to that true living 
That I had set my life to looking for. 

" Footsore I grew and faint, through never nearing 

The goal, yet hopeful ever of the prize, 

When suddenly, athwart my path appearing, 

I saw a distant gleaming barrier rise ; 

" A sheer white wall, pierced by a single gateway, 

Guarding twin doors of ivory finely cut, 
Twin doors that as I neared them opened straightway, 
And passed my leader through and swiftly shut. 

. " But when I came and stood beside them knocking, 

And strove to move the strong-joined silent beams, 
Forth came a voice in sadness half, half mocking, 
' Thou fool, go back, this is the gate of dreams.' " 

Mr. Rogers has written some spirited lyrics, some 
good classical idyls, some tender memorial pieces, 
and a few fine sonnets. From one of the latter 
called " I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills " we 
reproduce the sestet : 

" Sweet is the valley music, sweet the hum 
Of bees, but on beyond the upland mist 
Which sets false barriers to feeble wills, 
Are triumph tones, sonorous chords, that come, 
As from the touch of some strong organist 
Hidden amid the transepts of the hills." 

Mr. Harrison S. Morris also is a new-comer among 
our American poets, and not often do we witness so 
successful a debut. " Madonna and Other Poems " 
comprises over a hundred pieces, nearly every one 
of which bears the marks of careful workmanship, 
and no small number of which strike a note of ex- 
ceptional delicacy and purity. The predominant 
trait of the collection is a feeling for nature at once 
so sympathetic and so just as to recall the masters. 
It is true that Mr. Morris employs the conventional 
imagery, but the lightness of touch and the dainti- 
ness of his work make acceptable this new use of 
the old material. Imbued with the romantic spirit, 
and having a distinctive dash of sensuousness (in 
the good Miltonic signification) , these poems derive 
rather from Keats than from Wordsworth to name 



the two poets of whom we first think as the high 
priests of the cult of nature. We reproduce as a 
typical example the sonnet styled "A Touch of 
Frost." 

" But yesterday the leaves, the tepid rills, 
The muddy furrows, wore a summer haze ; 
The cattle rested from the yellow rays, 
Bough-cool and careless of the piping bills. 
No breath, no omen of the far-off ills 
Shuddered the air. To-day the hardened ways 
Lie drifted with the dead of summer days ; 
The year lies sheaved upon the autumn hills. 

" There in the sunburnt stacks the beauty sleeps 
Of beam and shower, dawn, and silver dew, 

Whisper of woody dusk, and upward deeps 
Of moonlight when the air is crystal blue. 

The bending farmer gathers into heaps 
A harvest with the summer woven through." 

Most of Mr. Morris's pieces are in lyrical form, or 
the allied form of the sonnet ; the most noteworthy 
exceptions are " Love's Revenge," a long Italian 
romance in six-line stanza, and " Amymone," a 
blank-verse idyl which might be printed among 
Landor's " Hellenics " without being detected as an 
interpolation by more than one reader out of ten. 

Every poet nowadays has to write a "sonnet- 
sequence," and so Mr. Francis Howard Williams has 
accepted the inevitable. His sequence consists of 
a sonnet for every hour of the twenty-four, begin- 
ning with one o'clock in the morning, an hour when 
most people are oblivious of sonnets and all other 
vanities. Mr. Williams's work deserves considerable 
praise for its finish and wholesome sentiment. We 
quote the last of the series, the rhyme of the mid- 
night hour : 

" Oh ! tender benison of darkness, cast 

Upon the throbbing bosom of the earth, 
Dropt as a mantle over all the mirth 
And madness of the day, thou ever hast 
A sweet compassion for us. and at last 
A poppied peace. I gaze upon the girth 
Of heaven, heavy with the rare new birth 
Of beauty crescent through the spaces vast, 

" The while the unruffled forehead of the night 
Lifts royally its diadem of stars ; 

Then, as a sleeper fares adown his way 
'Mid dreamy meadows, lying still and white, 

I thread the moonlit lane, pass through the bare, 
And close the record of an idle day." 

Mr. Williams is not only a sonneteer, but a writer 
of lyrics, odes, and dramatic pieces, as well. His 
" Ave America " is a patriotic outburst which echoes 
the passion of Lowell, and is not unworthy of its 
model or its theme. There are some pretty pieces 
in lighter vein at the close of the collection, includ- 
ing a certain " Ballad to a Bookman " which readers 
of THE DIAL will probably remember. On the 
whole, Mr. Williams seems to have won his spurs, 
and the ranks of our minor poets must open to ad- 
mit this new singer of very creditable song. 

Mr. Cooke's " Patch of Pansies " is a collection 
of verse, mostly trifling, that has been contributed 
to newspapers and other periodicals. It calls for 
no particular comment, but a brief example may be 
given :

[Feb. 1, 



" ' Unwept, unhonored, and unsung ' 

Were not the worst of Fortune's bringing ; 
Dread, rather, thine own eyes and tongue 

Unweeping and unsinging. 
Unweeping for thy brother, bound 

But struggling in the sombre Night, 
Unsinging from thy vantage-ground 

The happy tidings of the Light." 

This is a clear-cut thought, well expressed, but it is 
hardly poetry. A curious feature of Mr. Cooke's 
volume is that one dedication does not suffice ; the 
pieces are grouped, and for each group a distinct 
patron is invoked. 

" Penrhyn's Pilgrimage " is a series of versified 
impressions of travel in the East Japan, China, 
and Egypt. A couple of the stanzas to " Mount 
Fuji" will illustrate the form of the narrative and 
something better than the average of its inspiration. 

" O matchless mount, the centuries die 

And, moldering, form the forgotten past ; 
But still thy wooded base stands fast, 
Still thy white dome salutes the sky ! 

" At night I see thy snowy stair 

Ascending through the circling storm ; 
At morn behold thy graceful form 
Spring, like a flower, into the air." 

Whatever the ambition of our verse-addicted trav- 
eller, he should have refrained from seeking to bend 
Lord Tennyson's metrical bow.

BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 



The second volume of Mr. Edgar 
Stanton Maclay's "History of the 
United States Navy" (Appleton) 
falls no whit behind its fellow in interest and 
graphic quality, though the incidents seem at times 
a little crowded. Over-compression, however, is a 
fault on the right side. Mr. Maclay is distinctly 
the narrator not the historical generalizer or the 
critic of naval evolutions and armaments, like 
Captain Mahan. He tells a mainly unglossed story 
of the achievements of the American navy ; and 
when he warms to his work as in the accounts of 
the romantic sea-duels of 1812, where individual 
pluck and real seamanship counted, and before 
the gallant frigates of the Decaturs and Barneys 
gave way to the ignominious tanks and "tea-ket- 
tles " of modern marine he tells it in a style not 
unworthy of Cooper and Smollett. The volume 
opens with the events of the latter half of the war 
of 1812, thence passes on to the " Minor Wars and 
Expeditions " from 1815 to 1861 (including the war 
with Algiers, Perry's Japan Expedition, etc.), and 
closes with a detailed account of the naval opera- 
tions of the Civil War. The text is liberally illus- 
trated with wood-cuts, full-page and vignette, and 
there are plenty of maps and charts. The follow- 
ing extract from the London " Times " of Decem- 
ber 30, 1814, touching the issue of the war of 1812, 
is interesting as showing how Englishmen of the 



two English poets. 



time regarded that event, which later writers have 
tried to explain away: "We have retired from the 
combat with the stripes yet bleeding on our backs. 
. . . To say that it [the national maritime reputa- 
tion] has not hitherto suffered in the estimation of 
all Europe, and, what is worse, of America herself, 
is to belie common sense and universal experience. 
. . . Scarcely is there an American ship of war 
which has not to boast a victory over the British 
flag ; scarcely one British ship in thirty or forty that 
has beaten an American. With the bravest sea- 
men and the most powerful navy in the world, we 
retire from the contest when the balance of defeat 
is so heavy against us." This was written, be it 
added, before the news had reached England of 
the capture of the "Cyane " and the " Levant" by 
the "Constitution," the disabling of the "Endy- 
mion " by the " President," or the brilliant victory 
of the "Hornet" over the "Penguin." The story 
of our navy is a brilliant chapter in American his- 
tory ; and Mr. Maclay, writing con amore and with 
a good knowledge of his theme, has told it acceptably. 

The lover of literature will be satis- 
fie( j to nave upon fa s sne lves nothing 



less than the complete works ot the 
great poets, and we deprecate the practice of mak- 
ing "selections" from such men as Shelley and 
Tennyson, as much as we applaud the enterprise 
that has given us the entire poetic product of these 
men, as well as of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold, 
and others (to say nothing of the "Globe" Shake- 
speare, the new Chaucer, and the new Dante) in 
single compact and carefully-edited volumes. But 
when it comes to poets not of the first rank, " selec- 
tions" are as helpful as they are in the other case 
harmful. In fact, the really competent student and 
critic of poetry can hardly find a more praiseworthy 
task than that of carefully gleaning from the total 
product of some estimable but unmistakably minor 
poet the best parts of his work. The lease of life 
of such a poet is really renewed by this process; it 
gives him, as a rule, his one chance of impressing 
the generation that succeeds his own. Two books 
of the sort described are now before us : Professor 
George E. Woodberry's volume of " Selections from 
the Poems of Aubrey De Vere" (Macmillan), and 
Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton's similar selection 
from the poems of Arthur O'Shaughnessy (Stone 
& Kimball). Each of the books has a portrait and 
an introductory essay. The essay on Mr. De Vere 
is one of those pieces of serious critical workman- 
ship that Mr. Woodberry so well knows how to pro- 
duce. The characteristics of the poet are seized 
upon with unerring discernment. Mr. De Vere's 
poems are memorable for their " praise of the life 
of the lowly, in the old Christian sense," for their 
" praise of devotion, that loyal surrender to a man 
or a cause, which is one of the ideal passions of 
Love," and for their unfailing purity and faith. 
"In all this poetry, however its phases may be 
successively turned to the eye, or itself be inwardly

searched, there is one light and one breath the 
light of the Spirit and the breath thereof." These 
are noble ideals, and Mr. De Vere has steadfastly 
lived up to them throughout his long and active 
career. The storehouse of Irish legend has been 
put by him to such poetic uses as few if any others 
have achieved, and poems upon these national 
themes necessarily make up the greater part of those 
included in Mr. Woodberry's selection. Yet it seems 
to us that the poet has done his best work in the 
briefer forms of the lyric and the sonnet, and these 
also are well represented. We Americans owe Mr. 
De Vere a peculiar debt of gratitude for his sym- 
pathy with our national cause during the years of 
civil dissension, a sympathy that found expression 
in many ways, and not least in the noble sonnets 
" On the Centenary of American Liberty " and 
" The American Struggle." Mrs. Moulton, whose 
intimate associations with the group of writers to 
which O'Shaughnessy belonged peculiarly qualified 
her for the task of editing a volume of his poems, 
has done her work admirably. The best things 
have been chosen from the poet's four volumes, and 
the sketch of O'Shaughnessy's life is tastefully and 
tactfully written. His was an uncompleted exist- 
ence, and his last (posthumous) volume seemed to 
be " the tentative work of a poet in a transition 
state." "He had taken to himself a larger harp, 
but he had not yet completely strung it." Had he 
lived, the editor goes on to say, "he would have 
learned how to clothe his passion for humanity with 
the same tender grace with which in earlier days he 
sang the love of woman." As it is, no lover of 
poetry can afford to remain entirely unacquainted 
with his work, and Mrs. Moulton's volume will help 
to keep green his memory. 

The interest in folk-song and folk- 
lore is not only spreading but deep- 
ening; it surely does not deserve to 
be stigmatized as a fad. Neither the romantic en- 
thusiasts, the Percys and Scotts of a century ago, nor 
the scientific investigators, the Childs and Grundt- 
vigs of our own time, have been mere antiquaries 
and collectors ; the human interest of what they 
found, collated, and elucidated, is too great, and 
has been from the first too generally acknowledged. 
The interest in ballads to-day is simply the genuine 
thing we may always expect, 

" When that which drew from out the boundless deep 
Turns again home." 

But the " merry art is dead," the merry art of bal- 
lad-making. So we, robbed of the merry pastime 
of "lything and listening," must content ourselves 
with a ballad-book; and we may well content our- 
selves with such an one as Professor Gummere's 
"Old English Ballads" (Ginn), which gives us in 
three hundred pages the text of fifty odd ballads, 
and in nearly two hundred more an introduction, 
notes, a glossary, and appendixes on the ballads of 
Europe, on metre, style, and form, and on minstrels, 
and the authorship of ballads. Meeting the various 



Old English 
Ballads. 



demands of what a ballad-book should be, this is the 
best edition for practical purposes. The text is open 
to criticism, especially of the subjective kind ; but it 
is in the main sound, adhering to the traditions as 
preserved by Professor Child. Occasional emenda- 
tions are made but always from another text in 
Child ; in the case of some ballads the text is com- 
posite ; none of the letters peculiar to mediaeval 
MSS. have been retained. In the full introduction, 
originally a series of five lectures delivered at Johns 
Hopkins University, Professor Gummere etches with 
a caustic pen the progress of ballad criticism from 
Herder down. For his own part he insists upon the 
distinction between popular (" communal ") poetry 
and the poetry of the schools, which may attain pop- 
ularity, be for the people, but is not in any sense 
poetry of the people. Full and minute references 
to a host of critics, scholars, and philologians, make 
this introduction, supplemented by the appendixes, 
a veritable introduction to the study of ballad liter- 
ature. The notes and glossary are less full, leaving 
much desirable information to be obtained from 
sources notably Professor Child's monumental 
collection to which, after all, only the few have 
access. The printing of the ballad title, rather than 
the title of the book, at the top of the page, would 
have made reference easier and occasional brows- 
ing more satisfactory ; it is a more serious mistake 
that there are in the notes no references to pages, 
nor any indication of the order in which the ballads 
are printed. But the real excellences of the work 
are of a rarer kind and are great. 

The forty-second volume of Putnam's 
" Story of the Nations " series is 
given to Venice, and is written by 
Mrs. Alethea Wiel. As the author modestly con- 
fesses in her preface, the complete and definitive 
account of Venetian history, whether in Italian or 
English, has yet to be produced. Meanwhile this 
work will serve presumably an honest purpose, as 
faithfully tracing the fortunes of that Republic, 
from her mysterious origin to the noble spectacle 
of her supremacy, and thence her moral degrada- 
tion and final cession to Austria in 1798. A post- 
script of eight pages attempts to sketch the last cen- 
tury of her existence. The volume is furnished with 
a list of the Doges, a generous index, and numerous 
soft-toned prints of photographs and paintings. One 
misses here the style of a Symonds or an Oliphant ; 
nay, he half suspects, after reading several chapters, 
that the authoress is an inveterate Freemanite, and 
thanks God she has " no style," which is tenfold 
the affront to opalescent, silver-tongued Venice it 
could be to Sicily, perhaps. It is very easy to mis- 
take the materials of history for history itself, espe- 
cially when one has access to the Venetian archives, 
so full of the most detailed narrative " a hundred 
piping voices "; yet accuracy of investigation is a 
strongly redeeming virtue when there have been so 
many picturesque dabs into the story, never sacri- 
ficing it for the sake of truth. " An author," said

Lowell, " shrfuld consider how largely the art of 
writing consists in knowing what to leave in the 
ink-stand." Many of Mrs. Wiel's sentences are 
weighed down with a surplusage of nouns or adjec- 
tives at the cost of their effectiveness. At the very 
beginning of the first chapter, for instance, we are 
informed that " it may he well to consider for a mo- 
ment the manner in which the dwellings and habi- 
tations which formed the town took shape and be- 
ing, and also what measures were adopted to secure 
the ground whereon these homes and houses were 
about to be established." This rhetorical trick of 
using in pairs words of nearly the same meaning 
amounts to a mannerism with the writer, or it were 
endurable, like the occasional sight of Siamese twins. 
But " entirety and completeness," " exaction and de- 
mand," " advantage and gain," " marks and indi- 
cations," "slaughter and carnage," "attic or gar- 
ret," " haughty and overbearing " in Mr. Bagehot's 
words relative to Demosthenes' use of pebbles, we 
cannot dwell on it ; it is too much. The style of the 
historian of Venice need not be over-ornate, but 
it should be picturesque and accurate. 

Five critical studies of impressionist 
S5S18S!? type, haying for their respective sub- 
jects Heine, Rossetti, Marston, Rob- 
ertson of Brighton, and Mrs. Louise Chandler Moul- 
ton, are grouped by Mr. Coulson Kernahan into a 
pretty volume called "Sorrow and Song" (Lippin- 
cott). This title is not happily chosen* for two 
reasons: it was preempted twenty years ago for a 
similar purpose by Mr. Henry Curwen, and it is not 
applicable to all of the contents of the volume, since 
Robertson was not a singer, and since Mrs. Moul- 
ton's life has not been, as far as we know, typically 
sorrowful, however pervasive may be the minor 
strain of her song. The style of these essays is 
somewhat pretentious, but is often marked by a 
grave beauty, and they contain much penetrating 
criticism inspired by a close sympathy with their 
subjects. A passage from the Rossetti paper has a 
well-deserved fling at the moralists who insist that 
art shall always be didactic : " The folk who can 
call nothing good unless it carry, dog-like, at its 
tail a tin can of noisy and rattling morality, and the 
critics who forgetting that the very over-weight- 
ing of individuality, genius, as we call it, which 
gives a man such power on one side and in one 
direction, necessitates, by natural and inevitable 
law, a corresponding under-balance on the other 
cannot award their grudging meed of praise for 
honest work done, without complaining that some- 
thing else has been left undone, are a thankless set." 
The sentiment of this passage, by the way, is much 
better than the form. The study of Robertson gives 
due praise to that rare and noble character, and 
emphasizes the absolute sincerity that was his 
strength. It is the frequent lack of such sincerity 
in the profession which he adorned that makes the 
writer question " whether there is any educated class 
whose testimony carries less weight with the out-

side world to-day than that which follows religion 
as a profession." We fear that thei*e is only too 
much truth in this suggestion. Mr. Kernahan's 
tribute to Mrs. Moulton is finely appreciative, and 
hardly claims too much for a singer of whom we 
have great reason to be proud. If three or four of 
the women among us who are, or have been, poets 
are likely to live, Mrs. Moulton is surely one of the 
number. 

"American Writers of To-Day "(Sil- 
ver, Burdett & Co.), by Mr. Henry 
C. Vedder, is a series of nineteen 
brief essays upon as many American authors, all of 
whom but Mr. Parkman are still living. Nearly 
all of our best known men and women of letters 
are included. Since each of these essays is limited 
to about a score of pages, one must not look for 
any very exhaustive treatment ; nor has the author 
aimed at such. His critical remai'ks are interspersed 
with a few biographical details, although anything 
like a real biographical sketch is not attempted. As 
for the author's criticism, it is mostly of the obvious 
current sort, and hardly rises above the common- 
place. A generous impulse to set each subject in 
the best light is everywhere observable. A few 
minor points seem to call for comment. The open- 
ing statement that " America has as yet produced 
no poet who was poet and nothing else " is, of 
course, strictly true ; but the implied contrast with 
England would nearly disappear upon scrutiny. 
The parenthetical observation upon Tennyson's 
" Timbuctoo " is too disparaging. The " Library 
of American Literature " is in eleven volumes, not 
ten. Mr. Howells's " One Villain " is not named 
Bradley Hubbard. To call " Huckleberry Finn " 
trash, while praising, for example, " A Yankee at 
the Court of King Arthur," is to upset criticism 
altogether. To say " We have aesthetes in plenty, 
like Wilde and Pater," is something like saying 
" We have poets in plenty, like Tupper and Tenny- 
son." Finally, the remark that " American society 
is not quite guiltless of Becky Sharps " tempts us to 
ask why in the name of Heaven somebody does not 
discover one of them and thereby become the Great 
American Novelist. 



It is a rich and inspiring life that is

dren's Aid Society has acted directly upon five hun- 
dred thousand boys and girls; while the indirect 
benefits to society, in draining off from New York 
a vast number who would have developed into crim- 
inals, and in working out a scheme of beneficence 
that has been widely copied on both sides of the 
sea, cannot be estimated. The spirit, methods, and 
principles of this great charity are clearly brought 
out in this book, making it of special value to the

student of philanthropy. But its chief interest lies 
in the personality of the remarkable man who was 
himself more than his achievements. His clear in- 
sight into the needs of the wretched classes, and 
into the principles of true charity, is shown by the 
fact that the preliminary circular of the society, 
though far in advance of the thinking of the time, 
contained in the germ the whole vast and varied 
work which the society has since undertaken. This 
insight was united with a sober and critical judg- 
ment that made Mr. Brace a safe leader, and won 
for him the full confidence of the influential men 
of his city, and later of England and America. 
Enthusiasm for humanity, high spiritual and moral 
ideals, ardent patriotism, keen intellectual curiosity, 
great power in winning and keeping friends, and 
the success of his philanthropic work, all combined 
to make him a benefactor of his country and one of 
the foremost men of his time. The charm of this 
biography is due largely to the good taste and the 
sense of proportion of the author. 



The paragraph 
in English 



The first doctor's dissertation that 
has come to us from the English De- 
par tment of the University of Chi- 
cago testifies to the solidity and scientific thorough- 
ness of the graduate work done in that institution. 
It is a monograph on " The History of the English 
Paragraph," by Mr. Edwin Herbert Lewis, a work 
of two hundred pages and of infinite industry. Mr. 
Lewis has read a considerable portion of English 
literature for the express purpose of determining 
the characteristics of the paragraph, from the ninth 
to the nineteenth century, from Alfred to Holmes. 
He has counted the words and sentences in many 
thousands of paragraphs, and tabulated the results, 
leading to the somewhat barren conclusion that the 
length of the paragraph has not decreased with the 
sentence-length. He also discusses the mechanical 
signs and rhetorical theories of the paragraph, 
and some of the latest investigations into the struc- 
ture of English prose. In short, no labor seems to 
have been spared in bringing together or calcu- 
lating all the facts of any conceivable interest bear- 
ing upon the subject of this monograph. But we 
must confess, while paying admiring tribute to the 
industry and scientific spirit of a study like this, that 
it is not exactly our ideal of the work to be aimed 
at by a great school of literary study. And the 
author's results and tabulations are probably of less 
value to him than the intimate acquaintance with 
our literature that must have been acquired during 
the prosecution of the investigation. 



A pungent 
collection 
of essays. 



A very pungent collection of essays 
is Mr. Walter Blackburn Harte's 
" Meditations in Motley" (The Arena 
Co.). The author has an ample stock of convictions 
(sometimes a little crotchetty , perhaps) and he states 
them with refreshing point and candor. Mr. Harte's 
titles are: " On Certain Satisfactions of Prejudice"; 
"Jacobitism in Boston"; "About Critics and Crit- 



icism "; " Some Masks and Faces of Literature "; 
and " A Rhapsody on Music." " Essays " is hardly 
the best descriptive term for the papers Mr. 
Harte's hand being neither light nor his temper 
easy. Your true essayist is mostly a bit of a posem, 
a minter of nice phrases, something of a literary 
Turveydrop, in fact, who is much more concerned 
about his " deportment " than his matter. Style, 
or neatness of style, is scarcely Mr. Harte's strong 
point. There are too many long sentences, too 
many parentheses, and one notes here and there ex- 
pressions a shade too robust for the occasion, or for 
any occasion. What Mr. Harte lacks in urbanity 
he makes up in earnestness, his book being full of 
honest hammer - strokes of the plain truth that 
" shames the devil " and a good many besides. A 
notable paper is the one called " Some Masks and 
Faces of Literature." Here the author draws a 
most stinging indictment of sensational and mer- 
cenary journalism that is doubly effective in that 
he is himself a journalist speaking " out of the bit- 
terness of a full knowledge." The most tragical 
thing, Mr. Harte thinks, " about this horrible busi- 
ness of news-mongering, as we see it in this country, 
in its most degraded and impudent form, is not so 
much that it panders to the lowest elements of so- 
ciety, but that its huge vortex swallows up and de- 
bases and strangles so many fine, generous, noble 
natures, who might perhaps have made the world 
better for their having been in it. ... ( The dyer's 
hand is subdued to what it works in.' " The volume 
justifies the growing literary vogue of its author. 

The thirteenth annual report of the 
^ante Society, just published (Ginn), 
gives the customary list of accessions 
to the Dante collection in the Harvard College 
library, and Mr. Paget Toynbee's index of proper 
names in the prose works and canzoniere of Dante. 
This index is an abridgment of that just prepared 
by Mr. Toynbee for Dr. Moore's edition of the whole 
text of Dante, and it is something more, for it gives 
not only references but catch-words and phrases as 
well. The secretary, Mr. A. R. Marsh, announces 
the subjects for the Dante prize of one hundred 
dollars, to be competed for this year. He also ap- 
peals to Dantophilists everywhere to associate them- 
selves with the work of the Society, and thus make 
possible the publication of some important projected 
works. The annual fee is only five dollars, and 
certainly there ought to be found in this country 
many more students of Dante than the sixty now 
reported as members. The society has nearly pre- 
pared the materials for a concordance to the lesser 
Italian works, similar in plan to Dr. Fay's con- 
cordance to the "Commedia." A concordance to 
the Latin works is also projected. Other sugges- 
tions are : " The systematic publication, with En- 
glish translations, of the vision - literature of the 
Middle Ages ; the publication of extracts from the 
works of the Schoolmen and of the Chroniclers; 
and a revision of Blanc's 'Vocabolario Dantesco.'"

Child-life 
in Art. 



An extremely pretty and well-con- 
ceived little volume, that unfortu- 
nately came too late for inclusion in 
our Holiday notices, is Miss Estelle M. Kuril's 
"Child-Life in Art" (Knight). It has as its picto- 
rial feature twenty-five full-page plates ( one or two 
of which are slightly marred in the printing) after 
some twenty artists, ranging from Raphael to Mr. 
J. G. Brown which is certainly a pretty far cry. 
Among the best plates are "The Sistine Madonna," 
Reynolds's " The Strawberry Girl," Van Dyck's 
" Mary Stuart and William III.," Gainsborough's 
"Rustic Children," a "Child's Head" by Bou- 
guereau, Greuze's "La Cruche Casse'e," and "The 
Meeting " by Marie Bashkirtseff. Velasquez, Bel- 
lini, Murillo, Lippo Lippi, and others, are also rep- 
resented. The text is intelligently and pleasantly 
written, the author showing some knowledge of and 
much feeling for her theme. We venture to say 
that this daintily-bound and well-printed little work, 
though late in appearing, did not fail to find favor 
as a Christmas book; and it is by no means one of 
the ephemeral sort. 

The Dean of Rochester, being called

he has been charming audiences in our large cities 
with his presence, while those unable to hear him 
may still read what he has to say in the newly pub- 
lished "More Memories" (Macmillan), "being 
thoughts about England spoken in America." Dean 
Hole is as richly anecdotal in this volume as in its 
predecessor of two years since, and the pages have 
the same unpretentious and genial charm. They 
are upon all sorts of subjects : bores, preachers, 
roses, the drama, Sunday observance, working-men, 
and English sports. These are but a few of the 
many themes touched upon. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor Herbert Weir Smyth's monumental work 
on " The Sounds and Inflections of the Greek Dialects " 
(Macmillan), published by the Oxford Clarendon Press, 
takes up the task set aside by Ahrens half a century 
ago, and now does for the Ionic dialect even more than 
was done for the Doric and Aiolic dialects by the earlier 
scholar. We understand that the present volume, itself 
the fruit of many years' labor, is but the first instal- 
ment of a work destined eventually to embrace the other 
Greek dialects also, and to supplement Ahrens in his 
own field by means of the added results of nineteenth- 
century investigation. 

A Collection of Wild Flowers of California " is pub- 
lished (if we may use the word in this connection) by 
the Popular Bookstore of San Francisco. Miss E. C. 
Alexander has pressed and mounted the flowers, which 
include eight species, and which have kept their color 



better than is usual with herbarian specimens. A num- 
ber of sonnets and other verses have been written for 
the collection by Miss Ina D. Coolbrith and Miss Grace 
Hibbard, so that we may really call it a book, after all, 
and a very pretty book at that. 

Mr. Joseph Knight is both compiler and publisher of 
an anthology that no user of tobacco, if he have literary 
tastes at all, will want to do without. It is called " Pipe 
and Pouch," and its contents are so happily selected as 
to justify its further title of " The Smoker's Own Book 
of Poetry." All the good things, anonymous or acknowl- 
edged, are here preserved for us, Mr. Aldrich's " La- 
takia" and Lowell's numerous poems on the subject, 
Lamb's " Farewell " and Calverley's " Ode." The vol- 
ume is very prettily printed and bound. 

Mrs. Oliphant's two-volume work on " The Victorian 
Age of English Literature " (Lovell, Coryell & Co.) 
appears in a new edition, with a series of not very judi- 
ciously selected portraits. It is of course in no sense 
a critical or an authoritative treatment of the subject, nor 
is it likely to be taken for such. A careful examina- 
tion would doubtless reveal an appalling number of in- 
accuracies, and the most casual reader will come upon 
judgments so inept as to call forth a smile. But, if we 
do not take the book too seriously, it will be found read- 
able, and even helpful as a means of passing under 
rapid survey the various groups of Victorian writers. 

Professor Henry Craik's " Life of Jonathan Swift " 
was published nearly twelve years ago in a single large 
volume, and became at once the standard authority upon 
its subject. It now reappears in much more convenient 
shape, forming two volumes of the charming " Eversley " 
edition (Macmillau), and adorned with two portraits. 
The text is practically the same as before, the author 
having seen no reason to alter his opinions on the life 
of Swift, or his conception of the character and work of 
the great satirist. 

Bound up with the twelfth " General Catalogue of 
Columbia College " (New York) there is a facsimile 
reproduction of the first. It was a single broadside 
sheet of modest dimensions, printed in 1774, and giv- 
ing the names of all graduates for the sixteen years that 
the institution had then been in existence. The cata- 
logue now published is a volume of 620 pages, and is 
devoted solely to giving the names, dates, and ad- 
dresses (for those still living) of all the persons that 
have ever been connected with Columbia College, either 
as officers or students. " Great oaks from little acorns 
grow " is a homely proverb that does not often have a 
better illustration than this stout volume. The com- 
pilation has been made by Professor J. H. Van Am- 
ringe and Mr. John B. Pine. Its most distinctive fea- 
ture as contrasted with earlier issues is a "Locality 
Index," which groups the living graduates by states and 
cities, and ought to promote the establishment of many 
new alumni organizations. 

Two new parts of the " New English Dictionary " 
(Macmillan) begin, respectively, the letters D and F. 
(E has already been published entire.) D, which with 
E, will form the third volume of the great work, is 
edited by Dr. Murray; while F, beginning volume four, 
has been undertaken by Mr. Henry Bradley, who was 
responsible for E also. F, G, and H will be brought 
within the fourth volume. The two letters now started 
will be continued in quarterly sections, without interrup- 
tion. The parts now issued run from D to Deceit, and 
from F to Fang, respectively.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, January 26, 1895. 

The continuation of the American Copyright League 
as a permanent organization for the maintenance and 
improvement of the law enacted in 1891 has been abund- 
antly justified by recent events. It was thought by 
some members that with the passage of the bill estab- 
lishing international copyright the League's usefulness 
was at an end. The League has remained quiescent for 
four years, and has discouraged many well-meant move- 
ments to improve the law, in order that the latter might 
be thoroughly tested and that the principle of interna- 
tional copyright might be firmly established in the minds 
of the people. The so-called Hicks bill, by which it 
was proposed to remove copyright protection from en- 
gravings and etchings unless made in this country, re- 
quired immediate attention, however; and the power of 
the League and its affiliated societies has been shown 
by the promptness with which the bill has been de- 
feated by the active efforts of the League, under the 
able leadership of Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, its 
secretary. By the same token, the new Covert bill, to 
prevent excessive damages in cases where newspapers 
have infringed the copyright law, has very properly re- 
ceived the support of the League, and will no doubt be 
passed. Instead of a separate fine for each issue of a 
journal containing the pirated matter, the penalty is 
limited to double the market value of the copyright in- 
fringed upon. 

In deference to the wishes of the League, the Amer- 
ican Authors' Guild has postponed the recommendation 
of certain changes in the copyright law until a more 
propitious season. The Guild will perform a real ser- 
vice to all who earn their living by writing, if it is suc- 
cessful in its efforts to have authors' manuscripts rated 
as printed matter by the postmaster-general. Mr. Bis- 
sell has practically promised that this shall be done. 

The first of the " Atlantic Monthly " series of articles 
on " New Figures in Literature and Art " is from the 
pen of Mr. Royal Cortissoz, art-critic of the New York 
" Tribune," and has for its subject the work of Daniel 
Chester French. Mr. Cortissoz has also prepared for 
the March " Harper's " a paper which is a plea for " An 
American Academy at Rome," in which he will ques- 
tion the final authority of France in art, and will advo- 
cate the training of painters of all schools amid Italian 
traditions. Mr. Cortissoz is without question the most 
promising of our younger writers on art, having devoted 
himself almost exclusively to its study. His latest pa- 
per is probably the outcome of a pilgrimage made last 
summer through the principal art-centres of Europe, 
one of several that he has made. His criticisms of the 
decorations and art exhibits of the Columbian Exposi- 
tion are remembered here as among the most thorough 
and incisive which appeared. 

The preface of Professor Moses Coit Tyler's " Three 
Men of Letters " would seem to indicate that with the 
completion of his " Literary History of the American 
Revolution," soon to be sent to the press, his labors as 
an historian of American literature will be at an end. 
The present volume contains monographs upon Bishop 
Berkeley, Timothy D wight, and Joel Barlow. The 
first of these, the author says, " was an incidental pro- 
duct of the researches I made some years ago when 
working upon my ' History of American Literature 
During the Colonial Time,' but could not properly be 
included in that work." "The last two monographs 



were prepared for 'The Literary History of the Amer- 
ican Revolution,'" Professor Tyler continues, "but as 
the chief activity of the two writers thus dealt with 
belongs to the period immediately after the Revolu- 
tion, I have deemed it best to exclude them from 
that work." It is thus clear that the literature of the 
Republic will not be taken up by this author. His his- 
tories of Colonial and Revolutionary literature are not 
likely to be superseded, and, with Professor Richard- 
son's " History of American Literature," form a com- 
plete and satisfactory survey of our literary past. Mr. 
George Haven Pntnam, whose firm publishes all of these 
works, and who has himself turned author, has been 
lecturing the past week at Bowdoin College on the his- 
tory of publishing during the Middle Ages. Among 
the announcements of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons for 
the present year are new editions of " Mr. Midshipman 
Easy," by Marryat, illustrated by representative Am- 
erican artists ; " At Odds," by Baroness Tautphoeus ; 
and " Richelieu " and " Agincourt," by G. P. R. James, 
in their " Famous Novel Series." 

Mr. Rossiter Johnson, the veteran editor and author, 
is busily engaged upon the current volume of Apple- 
tons' " Annual Cyclopaedia," which has been rightly 
called " a history of the world for one year." A more 
than usually large number of distinguished people 
passed away in 1894, and special effort has been made 
to secure capable biographers. The biography of Rob- 
ert Louis Stevenson will be written by Mr. Edward L. 
Burlingame, editor of " Scribner's Magazine," a close 
personal friend of the dead romancer. Mr. Johnson 
has also been occupied for some time in seeing through 
the press his " Camp-fire and Battle-field, an Illustrated 
History of the Great Civil War," which will be pub- 
lished next week by Messrs. Bryan, Taylor & Co., of 
this city. The work will contain special contributions 
by eminent participants on both sides, with more than 
a thousand illustrations, many of them from photo- 
graphs belonging to the War Department, now engraved 
for the first time. The advance sale of this work, by 
subscription, has been unexpectedly large. 

The fourth volume of Professor John Bach McMas- 
ter's " History of the People of the United States " will 
soon be issued by the Messrs. Appleton. It takes up 
the story of the second war for independence, and the 
succeeding period. The volume has much to do with 
the economic history of our country at that time, and 
deals with the business depression and hard times which 
were the causes of the enormous exodus of seaboard 
residents to the Valley of the Mississippi. An interest- 
ing chapter is devoted to early American magazines 
and periodicals. 

Still another author has passed through the English 
Bankruptcy Court under discreditable circumstances, 
and, judging by recent experiences, it would not be sur- 
prising were he to come here and deliver literary lec- 
tures, which seems to be the last resort in such cases. 
The advent of a French writer of salacious stories was 
loudly heralded not long since; but a stinging editorial 
by Mr. Arthur Brisbane, in one of our daily newspapers, 
calling upon all good people to shun him and his lec- 
tures, has had the effect of keeping him away, for it is 

now announced that " M. is not coming, and never 

intended to come, to New York." 

Of quite another sort is the witty, whole-souled French- 
man, " Max O'Rell," now lecturing through the West. 
I have just heard that " Mark Twain's " article on 
" What Paul Bourget Thinks of Us," in the January 



92 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



" North American Review," will be answered by " Max 
O'Rell " in the March number. So I suppose there will 
be great fun, and the fur will fly. The Messrs. Harper 
have made a mystery of the new historical romance, 
" Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc," which will begin 
in the April number of their magazine. Judging by the 
title alone, the story should be by " Mark Twain," and 
I give the guess for what it is worth. Apropos of " Max 
O'Rell," the Cassell Publishing Co. has purchased the 
American rights of his last book, " John Bull & Co.," 
and the firm now publishes all of this author's works 
in this country. I understand that the American Pub- 
lishing Company, of Hartford, will hereafter publish all 
of " Mark Twain's " works, and that these books will 
be sold by subscription hereafter, as was formerly the 
case. 

A good deal of curiosity has been excited by a pointed 
reference in one of Whittier's letters, given in the re- 
cently published " Life and Letters," to " the best and 
ablest literary paper in the country." The apprehensive 
or incredulous editor of the Letters, Mr. Pickard, ap- 
pears to have felt called upon to suppress the name of 
the journal thus strongly characterized by Mr. Whit- 
tier, although his opinion on such a subject could hardly 
fail to be a matter of legitimate literary interest. How- 
ever, chance has thrown the original letter in my way, 
and the missing words may now be supplied: "THE 
DIAL." But I give the letter entire, having carefully 
copied it from Mr. Whittier's familiar handwriting: 
Hampton Falls, N. H., Aug. 19, '92. 

My dear Friend: I don 't believe that half of the nice things 
the papers are saying of thy little book reach thee. Here is 
a clipping from the Chicago " Dial," the best and ablest lit- 
erary paper in the country. With loving remembrance, from 
thy friend, JOHN G. WHITTIER. 

Thus it is seen that " the truth will out," in spite of 
hyper-cautious editors like Mr. Pickard. 

ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



IiITERARY NOTES. 



The Rev. H. Shaen Solly is writing a life of his late 
father-in-law, Professor Henry Morley. 

Moritz Carriere, author of " Die Kunst," and other 
works of philosophy and aesthetics, died at Munich a 
few days ago. 

Professor Augustus Chapman Merriam of Columbia 
College died at Athens on the 19th of January, at the 
age of fifty-one. He had been a member of the Co- 
lumbia faculty for more than a quarter of a century, 
and was, at the time of his death, away on leave of ab- 
sence for a year. 

The New York " Critic " for January 10 is made 
peculiarly interesting by its account of the Stevenson 
memorial meeting, as well as by other matter relating 
to the dead novelist. It also contains a noteworthy ar- 
ticle upon the second Congress of American Philolo- 
gists, held at Philadelphia during the holidays. 

With the appearance of the sixth and final volume of 
Dr. Skeat's Library Edition of Chaucer, the publishers, 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co., announce that a Supplement- 
ary Volume is in course of preparation by Professor 
Skeat, to be issued during the present year, containing 
the " Testament of Love " (in prose), and the chief 
poems which have at various times been attributed to 



Chaucer and published with his genuine works in old 
editions. The volume will be complete in itself, with 
an introduction, notes, and glossary; and will be uni- 
form with the Library Edition of Chaucer's Complete 
Works. 

Mr. David Christie Murray's talk at the Twentieth 
Century Club, on the evening of January 18, was re- 
ceived with much interest by the members of the Club. 
Taking for his subject " The Poet's Note-Book," Mr. 
Murray discoursed for about an hour and a half upon 
the essentials of poetic diction, with such tribute of en- 
thusiasm to Burns and other Scotsmen as their fellow- 
countrymen may always be counted upon to pay. 

The most serious literary loss of the month came on 
the eleventh, with the death of Dr. Thomas Gordon 
Hake, in his eighty-sixth year. He was one of the men 
of 1809, was educated at Christ's Hospital, studied 
medicine, travelled a good deal on the Continent, and 
finally settled down to practice in East Anglia. He 
was the intimate friend of Borrow and Rossetti, and 
published several volumes of poems " Valdarno," 
" Madeline," " New Symbols," " Parables and Plays," 
" Legends of To-morrow," " Maiden Ecstasy," and 
" The New Day." His Memoirs of Eighty Years " 
appeared in 1892, and a Civil List pension was granted 
him in 1893. 

Professor William Rufus Perkins, who died at Erie, 
Pa., on the 27th of January, was a man of rare char- 
acter and abilities, whose higher qualities were perhaps 
too little appreciated by the most of those who knew 
him. For some years before his death, he held the 
chair of History at the State University of Iowa, hav- 
ing gone there from Cornell University, where he was 
an assistant professor. He was the author of some val- 
uable historical papers, including an almost unique mon- 
ograph on the Iowa Trappists, based upon an exhaust- 
ive study of that singular and interesting community. 
He was also a reviewer of historical works for THE 
DIAL and other journals. But Professor Perkins's best 
work was as a poet. A shy and reticent man, it was known 
to but few of his friends that poetry was to him much 
more than the diversion of an idle hour that to it he 
gave his best powers and sought to express in it his real 
self. His poem of " Eleusis " has already been char- 
acterized in THE DIAL as one of the most remarkable 
and meritorious of the longer poems that have appeared 
in America in many years. The volume containing it 
(" Eleusis, and Lesser Poems ") was issued in 1892 ; it 
is not known that he is the author of any other books of 
verse. Professor Perkins was about forty-five years of 
age, and unmarried. 

Messrs. Ward, Lock, & Bowden, New York, are the 
agents in this country for " The Windsor Magazine," a 
new English monthly of the popular sort. It is more like 
" The Strand Magazine" than any other of its competitors, 
and sells at twenty cents a copy We note with grat- 
ification the re-appearance of " The Southern Magazine," 
whose untimely demise was chronicled a few weeks ago. 
It begins again with the January issue, under a new 
management. Of great importance also is the resump- 
tion of that very valuable weekly, " Science," under the 
auspices of an editorial committee comprising the most 
distinguished specialists in the country. The paper has 
gone back to the typographical features of the earlier 
volumes, and once more presents an exceedingly attract- 
ive appearance A most creditable addition to the sci- 
entific periodicals issued by the University of Chicago 
is " The Astrophysical Journal," which succeeds the old

" Astronomy and Astro-Physics," and which is now ed- 
ited by Professors George E. Hale and James E. Keeler, 
with the collaboration of a large number of American 
and European physicists and astronomers. From Los 
Angeles, Cal., comes " The Land of Sunshine," an illus- 
trated monthly whose bright and winning appearance 
does not belie its name. Its literary quality too is good. 
Under the editorial guidance of Mr. Charles F. Lum- 
mis, an experienced and favorably known literary worker, 
with the assistance of Mr. Charles D. Willard and 
other ready contributors, the periodical should not make 
its appeal in vain either to Californians or to more 

Eastern readers The first number of the American 

edition of " The Bookman," already noted in these col- 
umns, is expected to appear in February We may 

close this note upon the new periodicals of the year by 
mention of " The Metaphysical Magazine," a monthly 
devoted to Occultism.

12mo, $1.25. 

" There can be no doubt that ' Dr. Parkhurst's book ' will have a wide sale, not only because it gives the whole story of his crusade in con-

not? will read it to learn how the work of reformation may be carried on. The book is a monument to Dr. Parkhurst, raised by his own

STORIES OF THE FOOT-HILLS. 

By MARGARET C. GRAHAM. 16mo, $1.25. 
A volume of excellent short stories, some of which have at- 
tracted the marked attention of good readers notably " The 
Withrow Water-Eight" and "Alex Randall's Conversion," 
which were printed in the " Atlantic Monthly." These stories 
have grown out of Mrs. Graham's unique surroundings and 
careful personal observation in southern California. They 
have much variety, vigor, independence, and strong portrayal 
of character ; and it seems safe to anticipate for them an in- 
terest and a degree of popular favor not often won by volumes 
of short stories. 



HALF A. CENTURY WITH JUDGES 
AND LAWYERS. 

By JOSEPH A. WILLARD, Clerk of the Superior Civil 

Court, Boston. 16mo, $1.25. 

A book of great and varied interest, giving the author's 
reminiscences, which cover a long term of years and a great 
number of distinguished persons ; also a large collection of 
anecdotes of the leading lights of the Boston bench and bar. 
The book is very attractive to lawyers, and to all who enjoy 
good stories. 

LATIN POETRY.

Dublin. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

This volume is third in the series to which belong Mr. 
Stedman's book on " The Nature and Elements of Poetry " 
and Professor Jebb's on " Classical Greek Poetry." It treats 
admirably the various kinds of Latin poetry and the most 
characteristic Latin poets. 



THE FIRST NAPOLEON. 

By JOHN C. ROPES. With Maps and Appendices. New 
Edition. With a Preface and a rare Portrait of Na- 
poleon. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $2.00. 
A book of remarkable interest, especially in its treatment 

of Napoleon's military career, which Mr. Ropes is peculiarly 

competent to discuss.

MEDITATIONS IN MOTLEY. 

By WALTER BLACKBURN HARTE. 

(Author of " In a Corner at Dodsley's.") 

A Volume of Social and Literary Papers, shot through with 

whimsy, fantasy, and humor. 

" A brilliant, audacious book of brains. It will be sought after by 
the Decadents and book-hunters." Chicago Daily News. 

"These decidedly original essays are imbued with almost everything 
fascinating. There is dry humor and delightful sarcasm, as well as a 
profound knowledge of human nature, and the broad bold swing of the 
fearless thinker in Harte's ' Meditations in Motley.' " Chicago Even-

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE'S FIRST CAMPAIGN. 

With Comments by HERBERT H. SARGENT, First Lieu- 
tenant Second Cavalry, United States Army. Crown 
8vo, 231 pages, with maps, $1.50. 

The author considers that this campaign in Italy, 179G-97, though 
conducted on a less stupendous scale than many others in Napoleon's 
remarkable career, was surpassed by none in brilliancy, in completeness, 
in rapidity of movement, and in strategical combination. Collectors 
of works on Napoleon will find this volume a distinct addition to the 
subject. 

THE WONDERFUL WAPENTAKE. 

By J. S. FLETCHER (" A Son of the Soil "). With 18 
Illustrations by J. AYTON SYMINGTON. Crown 8vo, 
249 pages, $'2.00. 

This is a collection of twenty-five interesting sketches of English 
rural life and manners that have attracted unusual attention in the 
periodical press of England, where they originally appeared over the 
pseudonym "A Son of the Soil." Mr. Fletcher writes feelingly and 
lovingly of his wonderful Wapentake, in Yorkshire, and enlists the 
reader's attention at the beginning and holds it unflaggingly to the end. 
The author's homely subjects, accuracy of observation, and felicity of 
style strongly suggest the late Richard Jefferies, in whose footsteps he 
is following, and whose place he gives promise of filling. 

PAUL AND VIRGINIA. 

By BERNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE. An entirely new 
translation by Prof. M. B. ANDERSON. " Laurel- 
Crowned Tales." 16mo, SI. 00. 

The previous translations of "Paul and Virginia" can lay but little 
claim to literary merit. The publishers feel warranted in hoping that, 
by virtue of this exceptionally fine translation by so eminent a trans- 
lator, the tale will now take its place as an English classic.

READING AND EDUCATION. 

In these days of multiplied universities and 
degree)!, when a young man or woman of 
earnest purpose is rarely so handicapped by 
adverse environment as to be quite unable to 
get the higher education in the academic sense 
of that term, it is possible that we attach too 
much importance to the culture that is based 
purely upon scholastic titles. Historical ex- 
amples without end prove to us that culture 
of the finest type has been attainable out- 
side the walls of any institution of learning, 
and there is no reason to doubt that the pro- 
cess which has produced self-educated men in 
the past is equally available and effective at the 
present time. Indeed, it may be urged that 
the man intellectually self-made, if his achieve- 
ment show him to be really educated, has an 
advantage over the man who has found the 
ways of learning smoothed for him, the rough 
places levelled, and the natural impediments to 
progress cleared away by other hands than his 
own. It is he who best knows the value of 
what has been so hardly acquired ; his attain- 
ment has a substance and a solidity that the 
most brilliant of university careers may fail to 
give. After all, the test of culture, outside of 
narrow academic circles, is not based upon such 
external things as degrees and fellowships, but 
upon capacity, upon evidence of the finer issues 
of thought and feeling, and the power to quicken 
other spirits to those issues. 

Perhaps the most important of educational 
institutions is that which everyone may have 
at his door, or even within arm's reach a well 
filled set of book-shelves. Having this, we have, 
however socially isolated, the " means of get- 
ting to know, on all matters which most con- 
cern us, the best which has been thought and 
said in the world." One is almost ashamed to 
make so hackneyed a phrase do duty once more, 
but Matthew Arnold seized the root of the mat- 
ter, and if the thing needs to be repeated at all, 
it can hardly be done otherwise than in his 
words. Reading is a very serious affair, one 
of the most serious that there are, yet how few 
realize both in thought and act its educational 
possibilities. A man's library, assuming it to be 
for use and not for display, is a better index 
to his character than the most detailed of ex-

ternal biographies. Show us the man at work 
in his library, and we view him in his essence, 
not in his seeming. There is no greater edu- 
cational problem than that of persuading men 
and women everywhere not merely the few 
favored by training and predisposition to 
surround themselves with books of the right 
sort, and to make the right use of them. Our 
popular educational movements, our C^autau- 
qua circles and University Extension courses, 
are all working in this direction, although 
rather aimlessly and with much misdirection 
of energy ; what we need is more persistent 
and systematic endeavor effort duly elastic 
and individual in adaptation while still system- 
atic on the part of all who are occupied with 
the diverse phases of the educational movement. 
Every teacher, every librarian, every popular 
lecturer, every writer for magazine or newspa- 
per, can do something for the common cause by 
way of influence ; every private individual, in 
his own circle of acquaintances, can at least do 
something by way of example. 

The average adult, whose intellectual en- 
vironment seems to be a matter of choice, is 
really subjected to influences that are not easy 
to resist. The modern newspaper, with its bad 
writing and its vulgar ideals, the popular mag- 
azine, with its ephemeral or sensational pro- 
gramme, the cheap book, even cheaper in its 
contents than in its mechanical execution 
these are the temptations that beset his" every 
spare hour, and deprive him of communion with 
the great spirits who stand ready to tell him 
" the best which has been thought and said in 
the world." " Will you go and gossip with 
your housemaid or your stable-boy, when you 
may talk with queens and kings ; or flatter 
yourself that it is with any worthy conscious- 
ness of your own claims to respect that you 
jostle with the hungry and common crowd 
for entree here, and audience there, while all 
the while this eternal court is open to you, 
with its society, wide as the world, multi- 
tudinous as its days, the chosen and the 
mighty of every place and time ? " None of 
us can altogether escape the distracting influ- 
ence of the commonplace writing that on every 
hand insinuates itself into our acquaintance ; 
yet if we content ourselves with such work, if 
we do not resolutely reject its impudent preten- 
sion of sufficiency, we miss the most effective 
means for the realization of our better selves. 
Every reader ought now and then to fortify 
himself against temptation by reading some 
such essay as Mr. Ruskin's on " Kings' Treas- 



uries," or Mr. Morley's on " The Study of Lit- 
erature," or Mr. Harrison's on " The Choice of 
Books "- not for their commendation of par- 
ticular lines of reading, or to blindly acquiesce 
in their individual dicta, but for their lofty 
standpoint, their liberal outlook, and their tonic 
effect. 

The foundations of the reading habit are, of 
course, laid in childhood ; and the responsi- 
bility for these foundations is one of the great- 
est that the professional educator has to bear. 
The child should be as carefully guided in the 
choice of his reading as the adult should be 
free to determine what is best for his own 
spiritual needs. How precious are the years 
from six to sixteen, with their eager receptivity 
and their retentive grasp, seems to be but im- 
perfectly understood by the directors of our 
schools. It is hardly less than criminal to pro- 
vide children of such an age with the namby- 
pamby artificial reading that is now manufac- 
tured for their use. A child's reading should 
be confined to the very best literature that he 
is capable of understanding and it is aston- 
ishing what he will understand if given a 
chance. Nor should he be kept upon short ra- 
tions for the purpose of drill in vocal expression. 
Fresh matter is always better than old for dis- 
cipline, and the most vitalizing pages lose their 
power for good if too frequently conned. The 
childish desire for new worlds to conquer is 
very strong, and is sure to find vent in the 
wrong direction if not freely indulged in the 
right one. 

The high school and college period of edu- 
cation is essentially that in which the student 
is trained to shift for himself. It is the period 
when restrictions upon reading must be relaxed, 
and freedom of choice watchfully encouraged. 
Somewhere within this period of intellectual 
adolescence there comes a transitional stage 
which tests all the training of the previous 
year. The duty of those who are responsible 
for the student during this critical period is 
rather to stimulate than to direct his reading ; 
to encourage him in looking beyond the horizon 
of his text-books, to make it easy and pleasant 
for him to read in helpful lines ; to throw all 
sorts of unobtrusive obstacles in his path, if he 
exhibits any tendency toward intellectual dissi- 
pation. The school or college library is, next 
to the wise instructor, an essential factor in 
this problem, and the studies of history and 
literature, of the ancient and modern languages, 
are those upon which reliance must mainly be 
placed in this task of making of formal educa-

tion a real preparation for life. We have of 
late years witnessed a remarkable expansion in 
the scientific departments of school and col- 
lege, and a greatly increased expenditure for 
their adjuncts of laboratory and museum. The 
expansion was needed, and no educator can 
intelligently begrudge it. But the group of 
studies which find in the library both museum 
and laboratory the studies which we right- 
fully call humanities and for which we thereby 
claim the place -of first importance and of clos- 
est relationship to our deepest spiritual needs 
may fairly demand as much attention and 
as large an expenditure as the sciences of nature. 
It is not too much to ask that every dollar set 
apart for scientific apparatus shall be matched 
by another dollar set apart for literary appa- 
ratus. The student of history or of literature 
ought to have the use of his own set of books, 
just as the student of chemistry has the use of 
his own set of reagents. When the humanities 
come again into their own, this necessity will be 
recognized as fully as the necessity of labora- 
tory teaching in chemistry is now recognized. 
Given the right guidance in childhood, and 
the right influences during adolescence, the 
reading habit may be counted upon to remain 
a genuine educational influence through life. 
The importance of such guidance and such in- 
fluences can hardly be over-estimated. But for 
those who have missed them, for those who in 
the future will miss them, there is still the con- 
soling truth that serious aims coupled with 
earnest endeavor can nearly always find the 
path to a very complete culture. " The best 
which has been thought and said in the world," 
like the sunlight, shines freely for all, and to it 
the veriest mole may, if he will, grope his way. 
" Eeading maketh a full man," and more than 
that no scheme of formal education, however 
extensive, may accomplish. 



C OMMUNICA TIONS. 

COLLEGE STANDING IN IOWA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The college teachers of Iowa have been engaged in 
a discussion, since 1891, regarding "College Standing," 
which discussion, it seems to me, from the nature of 
some of the points involved has more than a local inter- 
est. The State has within its borders an unusually large 
number of " colleges " and " universities," even for a 
Western State, perhaps two score or more. At its 
session in 1891, the College Department of the State 
Teachers' Association determined to do what no other 
State had attempted namely, to define practically the 
term " College," and to exclude from membership those 




institutions not meeting the terms of the defini 
Consequently it was resolved that after 1893 no college 
should be eligible to membership " which should not 
require for admission to the freshman class three full 
years of work above the grammar grade, and four addi- 
tional years of collegiate work for the baccalaureate 
degree." A committee was appointed in 1892, to col- 
lect statistics on the following points : The number 
and variety of degrees conferred ; the requirements for 
the baccalaureate degrees; and, finally, data indicating 
the equipment of Iowa Colleges for doing the work 
required. 

The first report of this committee was made in 1893, 
and revealed a rather surprising state of affairs. Many 
institutions were doing preparatory work in the fresh- 
man year; the line of demarcation was in some cases 
not clearly drawn between the academy, which is usu- 
ally found in connection with the Western college, and 
the collegiate department proper; some were requiring 
their teachers to do both college and academy work; 
and some had less than six teachers to do the entire 
work of the institution. The committee assumed in 
their consideration of the case that the term " college " 
had something like a definite value, and that it should 
not be applied to all institutions indiscriminately, with- 
out protest. To determine what the standard should 
be, was a part of the work of the committee. This is 
interesting, as it is perhaps the first attempt made in 
this country, under similar circumstances, to determine 
what the term " college " should mean. The following 
are the tests applied: First, satisfactory and complete 
conditions of admission to freshman standing; second, 
correct organization of courses with sufficient force of 
instruction to create a college atmosphere; third, fac- 
ulty of instruction, consisting of at least eight chairs, 
as follows: (1) Psychology and Ethics (including in- 
struction in Philosophy and Logic), (2) Ancient Lan- 
guages, (3) Mathematics and Astronomy, (4) English 
Language and Literature, (5) Physics and Chemistry, 
(6) Modern Language, (7) History and Political Sci- 
ence, (8) The Biological Sciences. 

Judged by these criteria, there were three institutions 
in the State entitled to college standing. It was deemed 
undesirable, however, to exclude from the list some 
colleges doing work of a highly creditable character. 
Consequently there was recommended a " provisional 
minimum " of six chairs. In this provisional minimum, 
(4) and (7) of the foregoing list were classed together 
as " English and History," and in like manner (5) and 
(8) were united under the term " Natural Sciences." 
In this way the total number of colleges was increased 
to eight. The report was read, but action was post- 
poned for one year in order that corrections and additions 
might be made. 

At a recent meeting of the College Department of 
the State Teachers' Association (December 27) the 
report was taken up for final action. During the year 
every effort had been made to settle disputed points, 
and opportunity given to every institution to put itself 
in accord with the criteria proposed. Two institutions 
did this without trouble, making the total number ten. 
It was recommended that this number should be grouped 
together as " Class A," while those failing in the tests 
should be included in " Class B." The technical schools 
(which had not been considered at all by the committee) 
and the smaller colleges opposed the motion to adopt 
the report, with so much success that another postpone- 
ment for one year was secured. This postponement

seems to be chiefly in the interest of the technical schools, 
since coupled with the motion to postpone was the rec- 
ommendation to " reconsider the basis of classification." 
It is not likely that a vote on the report will ever be 
taken. The arbitrary settlement of a disputed point of 
this sort would be sure to meet with disfavor. The 
discussion, however, that has already been aroused has 
been of great value to the interests of higher education 
in the State. The stronger institutions have become 
somewhat more conscious of their deficiencies, while the 
weaker ones are making more earnest efforts than ever 
to reach a higher level. J H T MAIN

A POET TOO LITTLE KNOWN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your notice of the death of Professor William Ruf us 
Perkins, author of " Eleusis " and other remarkable 
poems, inspires me to add a word of tribute to a poet too 
little known, and likely to receive a wider appreciation, 
as often happens, after death. " Eleusis " is a not un- 
worthy sequel to Tennyson's " In Memoriam," the mod- 
ern philosophical companion of the " Rubaiyat " of Omar 
Khayyam. One may find in it many quatrains equal 
to the following terse description of that subtle enchant- 
ment which Rome still weaves about the souls of scholar- 
pilgrims: 

" I lay upon the Palatine 

When evening lit her changeless dome, 
And felt the mighty hand of Rome 
Enfold and clasp itself in mine." 

" Bellerophon " is another remarkable poem a new 
interpretation of the old Greek myth, not surpassed by 
any of Miss Edith M. Thomas's classical studies, such 
as " Lityerses and the Reapers " and " Atys." Here is 
a little description which has the same effect upon the 
mind as Mr. Elihu Vedder's lonely landscapes: 

" Behind me lies the broad Aleian plain, 
The loneliest plain that faces to the sky, 
Across which, groping with increasing pain, 
I course forever, for I cannot die. 
O heartless plain, and earless to my cry ! 
A thousand thousand are the paths I wear 
On thy broad back ; and Night, who does defy 
For most the spear of sorrow and of care, 

For me may bring no rest, but doubles up despair." 

Professor Perkins once wrote me: "I made up my 
mind when a boy that if I ever published anything in 
poetry, I would wait until I had made it perfect artistic- 
ally," and that saying is the keynote to his whole poet- 
ical work. 

A few brief details of the poet's life, sent by him at 
my request, and intended for use in another periodical, 
may be quoted here: 

" I was born in the year 1847, in Erie, Pennsylvania. 
I graduated in 1868 at Western Reserve College, Ohio, 
and was tutor in my Alma Mater for three years after 
graduation; then devoted myself to the reading of his- 
tory and law. In 1879 I was called to Cornell Uni- 
versity as Assistant Professor; after six years at Cornell 
I went to Europe, where I remained a year, attending 
the Universities of Berlin and Bonn, and travelling. 
Upon my return I was called to this chair [History, 
State University of Iowa]. In the spring of 1888, I 
was elected a delegate to the 8th Centenary of Bologna 
University in Italy. Going again to Europe, I attended 
this superb fete, and afterwards travelled in England 
and France, returning to the University of Iowa in the 



autumn. A first edition of ' Eleusis ' was issued in 1890 
without the ' Lesser Poems,' and was published anony- 
mously in accordance with the advice of several prom- 
inent men; but in 1892 it was published by Messrs. 
McClurg & Co. in its present form." 

Professor Perkins had planned a second volume of 
poems, and upon my asking him to make the pieces less 
threnodic in tone than those first published, he re- 
sponded, " No, I shall never publish anything quite so 
threnodic again if I can help it." In March last, un- 
der the gathering shadows of ill health, he wrote me: 
" As to the future volume, nothing can be said at pres- 
ent." His favorite poets were Schiller and Goethe, 
although Thackeray's and Shakespeare's works were 
often found in his hands. He disliked athletic exercise 
and detested walking, but enjoyed sea- voyages intensely. 
Books and rare old china attracted him, but he had no 
particular passion as a collector. Until his health failed, 
he was by no means of so melancholy a temperament 
as his poems might seem to indicate. His poetical range 
was limited; but what he achieved was full of promise 
for his future, and " Eleusis," " Bellerophon," and "Had- 
rian's Lament Over Antinous " are poems which the 
world ought not to let die. MARY j REID

"HERR" BJORNSON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL and elsewhere I frequently see the 
names of Bjornson and other Norwegian authors with the 
title " Herr " prefixed. This practice, which is common 
in America, is doubtless supposed to be in imitation of 
what is customary in the old country. As a rule, how- 
ever, the title " flerr " (nearly always written " Hr.") 
is not used in Norway before the names of distinguished 
men. Bjornson, Ibsen, Lie, Kielland, and the rest, are 
called so, or by their full names, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, 
Henrik Ibsen, Jonas Lie, etc., but hardly ever Hr. 
Bjornson, etc., except of course when addressed or 
spoken of in their hearing. Why should we in speak- 
ing of Norwegian authors adopt a form of title almost 

unknown in their native country ? 

ALBERT E. EGGE. 
The University of Iowa, Feb. 9, 1895. 

[The titles by which gentlemen usually refer to 
one another are not given by THE DIAL to living 
writers " in imitation " of any actual or suppositi- 
tious practice in "the old country," but because of 
what we believe to be the requirements of good lit- 
erary manners. Among the many vulgarities fos- 
tered by our newspapers none is, in our opinion, 
more detestable than the habit of constantly refer- 
ring to people as Smith and Jones and Robinson, 
without the simple courtesy of a prefix. If the 
Scandinavian or other European practice derogates 
from this not very exacting standard, we must re- 
gret the fact without yielding the point. EDR.

DIALECT IN THE UNITED STATES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The study of dialects in America, carrying with it an 
enumeration of the many interesting survivals in folk- 
speech, is still in its infancy, though much excellent work 
has already been done through the medium of the Dia- 
lect Society, and by Professors Kittredge and Sheldon of 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



105 



Harvard, Charles Forster Smith of the University of 
Wisconsin, Wyman of the University of Alabama (who 
has recently given the correct derivation of bayou), Dr. 
H. A. Shands of Texas, Dr. William Rice Sims of the 
State University of Mississippi, and others. 

The negro dialect, as spoken on the plantations in the 
South, is rich in survivals; and that a number of these 
are still found in England, is shown by some examples 
taken from " Lorna Doone " a well of English unde- 
filed. Note the following : axe for ask ; spunky meaning 
spirited or brave, used also by whites in the South; 
liefer as comparative of lief, meaning rather; gwain for 
going ; peart, meaning well (as " How is your old 
'oman ? " " She 's right peart ") ; clomb, preterite of 
climb (the negroes use more generally another form, 
clum). These words and expressions are all in common 
use among the negroes, and must have come to them 
from old England. They were jotted down while read- 
ing rapidly; a careful study of the book named would 
doubtless reveal many more. 

A friend, born in New Hampshire, tells me that his 
grandmother always spoke of a village of a hundred 
housen, holding to the old form of the plural (compare 
oxen, hosen, etc.). In " Lorna Doone " eyen is used as 
the plural of eye. 

Though the causative meaning of drench is recog- 
nized in the " Century" and " International " dictionaries, 
and still occurs in England (witness, " Dosed him with 
torture as you drench a horse " Browning's " Ring and 
Book," II., 75), upon the testimony of several careful 
students of language it is no longer used in this sense 
in New England. In the South the verb is used very 
generally in the causative sense ; a horse is drenched for 
colic i. e., his head is held up and he is caused forcibly 
to drink. 

The use of right (meaning very) and mighty, as ad- 
verbs, is general throughout the South, and the words 
are constantly in the mouths of those " to the manner 
born." The use of " mighty," characterized as colloquial 
in the great dictionaries, is met with in the North and 
West as well. 

In folk-speech we meet with the variants, to get shut, 
shet, or shed of, all meaning to get rid of, to relieve 
one's self of. An Ohio man tells me that he is only fa- 
miliar with "to get shut of"; and so says one from 
Connecticut. A North Carolinian has heard both shed 
and shut; while a South Carolinian whom I questioned 
was familiar only with shet. (See also Octave Thanet, 
" Peterson's Magazine," January, 1893). I have heard 
all three forms. Thomas Hardy, in " A Pair of Blue 
Eyes," uses still another form, " to get shot of." A 
shop-boy in " Neal's Sketches" says: "I want to get 
shut of you because I am going to shet the door." These 
two examples would indicate that this expression, too, 
came across the seas. The primitive idea seems to be 
riddance by means of shutting one out, for the forms 
shet and shot are used regularly by the negroes and are 
of common occurrence in the folk-speech of a large 
portion of this country, as " Shet that door." " The 
door is shot." The form shed, it seems, is probably a 
variation from shet; whereas if the other forms were 
not three to one we might conclude that the original 
idea was that of riddance by taking off, as a garment. 
A well-known Southern writer has a man of educa- 
tion a priest, in fact use unthoughtedly for thought- 
lessly; and though in this case the writer nodded, she 
was unconsciously revealing her knowledge of folk- 
speech. The great dictionaries are innocent of this 



word, but its use is widespread in the South, and it has 
a position by tolerance in the vocabulary of some read- 
ing people. ALEXANDER L. BONDURANT.

AN ENGLISH DIALECT DICTIONARY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Lexicography on the grand scale is the order of the 
day. Another thesaurus, this time in the form of an 
English Dialect Dictionary, is shortly to begin publica- 
tion. The materials which have been gradually collect- 
ing since the formation of the English Dialect Society 
in 1873 have now reached such dimensions, and made 
such reasonable approach toward completeness, that the 
work of preparing for publication the million and more 
slips now on hand has actually been commenced, under 
the editorial supervision of Dr. Joseph Wright, the 
Honorary Secretary of the society, assisted by Professor 
W. W. Skeat. In response to Dr. Wright's call for 
volunteers to cooperate in the work of completing the 
collections, some six hundred persons are now engaged 
in different parts of Great Britain in the organized work 
of excerpting from books and reducing dialectal glos- 
saries to the form of slips. It is the purpose of the 
editor to include in the dictionary all dialectal words or 
dialectal uses of words to be found within the entire do- 
main of the English speech of the eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries, i. e., all words or uses of words not 
recognized in the standard English of this period. The 
dictionary will give in every case its authority, and, if 
possible, will cite, after the manner of Murray's En- 
glish Dictionary, one or more passages illustrating the 
word and its use. Careful attention will also be paid 
to denning the habitat of the word ; and so far as pos- 
sible its history or etymology will also be determined. 
As it has been decided to include American English 
within the scope of the work, it becomes of great im- 
portance to the editors to secure immediate cooperation 
on this side of the Atlantic in the collection of material. 
As yet, the only reliance is the very uncertain and con- 
fused material of our various dictionaries of " Ameri- 
canisms," and the excellent though rather hap-hazard 
word-lists which have appeared in the different num- 
bers of the " Dialect Notes " published since 1890 by 
the American Dialect Society. It is evident how im- 
portant this new undertaking must prove for the study 
of American English; it is, indeed, only through this 
clearing-house of a universal English dialect dictionary 
that we can hope to reach a test for the genuineness of 
" Americanisms." All who may have material to con- 
tribute, or who may be willing to undertake assign- 
ment of books for reading, are requested to correspond 
with the editor, address, Professor Joseph Wright, 6 
Norham-road, Oxford, England ; or with Professor Eu- 
gene H. Babbitt, Columbia College, New York City, 
who will cooperate with the editor in securing and ar- 
ranging the American material. It is expected that a 
prospectus of the work, accompanied by specimen pages, 
will shortly be issued, and subscriptions will be solic- 
ited. The work will be furnished to subscribers at the 
rate of two numbers a year, with an annual subscription 
fee of 1. For non-subscribers the price of each num- 
ber will be 15s. Concerning the length of time likely 
to be absorbed in publication, and the consequent extent 
of the work, the editors give no assurance ; this, we are 
to presume, the material will dictate.

THE CONFESSIONS OF A JOURNALIST.* 



Tradition has it that when Dr. Johnson heard 
that James Boswell intended writing his life, 
he promptly proposed to prevent it by taking 
Boswell's. It does not seem to have occurred 
to the Doctor, in the alarm and flurry of the mo- 
ment, that, without resorting to manslaughter, 
he could forestall the impending Life and ren- 
der it comparatively stingless by writing one 
himself. This milder preventive against unde- 
sirable biographers has latterly grown much in 
favor. Every man his own Boswell, may fairly 
be called the biographical order of the day ; and 
the rule is not altogether a bad one. Every man 
is at least theoretically sure to deduct noth- 
ing from the tale of his own virtues ; and as 
experience shows that the list of his failings 
may safely be left to his friends (to say noth- 
ing of the press), the public is tolerably sure 
in the end of a complete picture with the due 
chiaroscuro effect. Now and then there emerges 
from the rank and file of autobiographers one 
candid enough to relieve his friends of their 
melancholy office ; and such a one, emphatic- 
ally, is Mr. George Augustus Sala. We have 
read Mr. Sala's " Life and Adventures " with 
the liveliest interest. Here at last is an auto- 
biographer who is not only frank, but who even 
appears at times, in the exuberance of his 
candor, to bear himself a grudge. It may be 
meanly urged that Mr. Sala, as an Old Jour- 
nalistic Hand, is unable from long habit to ab- 
stain from "racy" personalities and revelations, 
even at his own expense ; and that his frankness 
as to the follies and escapades of his youth rings 
more of an unrepentant Master Shallow than 
of a broken and a contrite heart. But the 
great fact of frankness remains ; and with it 
goes hand-in-hand the twin autobiographical 
virtue of modesty, for Mr. Sala, so far from 
being with monotonous regularity the hero of 
his own "Adventures," not seldom emerges con- 
spicuously at " the smaller end of the horn." 
When, for instance, he engages in a " row " in 
a disreputable quarter of London, it is he, and 
not the enemy, who "takes the floor " and is 
carried away for repairs. When he sets out 
(as he does twice) for Aix-la-Chapelle or Hom- 
burg with the cheerful intention of "breaking 
the bank," he returns, not laden with thalers

and Friederichs d'Or, but minus his valuables 
and plus sundry unpleasant tokens of their de- 
tention by Herr Israel Hirsch, Herr Salomon 
Fuchs, Herr Benjamin Isaacstein, and other av- 
uncular friends of the Gentile in need. When, 
in 1884, with his literary and journalistic hon- 
ors thick upon him, he re-visits America and 
is presented in state to General Benjamin F. 
Butler, he is received by that hero, not with 
" distinguished courtesy," but with the stag- 
gering avowal, " If you had been in New Or- 
leans in 1864 I should most certainly have 
hanged you; yes, sir!" and, adds Mr. Sala, 
thoughtfully, " I thoroughly believe the Gen- 
eral would have been as good as his word." 
Not to multiply examples, we shall only add 
that Mr. Sala, after heaping on himself such 
actionable epithets as " slovenly, careless, ne'er- 
do-weel," " dissolute young loafer," " outra- 
geous Mohock," etc., caps the climax of self- 
immolation by pronouncing his own novel, " The 
Baddington Peerage," " almost the worst one 
ever perpetrated." In this instance, at least, 
he does not grossly exaggerate. 

Mr. Sala was born in 1828, at London, where 
his mother, widowed shortly after his birth, was 
a teacher of singing, and, later, an actress. 
Madam Sala had a distinguished clientele, and 
played at the leading theatres ; but, with five 
young children on her hands, she had no little 
trouble bringing the proverbial ends together. 
Twice a year, to eke out her income, she gave 
special concerts, one at London and the other 
at Brighton. For one of these occasions she 
had the temerity to engage, at great expense, 
not only Mme. Malibran, but Paganini the 
poor lady cherishing the hope that in the end 
one or perhaps both artistes would generously 
waive their pecuniary claims. The concert was 
a brilliant success ; and then came the ordeal 
of paying the bills. The lesser performers, as 
usual, smilingly refused to accept a shilling for 
their services. Not so the great Malibran. 
Says our author : 

" The renowned singer smiled, chucked me under the 
chin, patted me on the head, told me to be a good boy, 
and very calmly took the thirty-one pounds ten shill- 
ings which with trembling hands my mother placed upon 
the table." 

Thus depleted in purse and hopes, Madam Sala 
sought out Paganini. Of this celebrity, our 
author says : 

" I can see him now a lean, wan, gaunt man in black, 
with bushy hair something like Henri Rochefort, and 
more like Henry Irving. He looked at me long and earn- 
estly; and somehow, although he was about as weird a 
looking creature as could well be imagined, I did not feel

afraid of him. In a few broken words my mother ex- 
plained her mission, and put down the fifty guineas on the 
table. When I say that he washed his hands in the gold 
that he scrabbled at it, as David of old did at the gate 
and grasped it and built it into little heaps, panting 
the while, I am not in any way exaggerating. He bun- 
dled it up at last in a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief 
with white spots and darted from the room. And we 
my poor mother convulsively clasping my hand went 
out on the landing and were about descending the stairs 
when the mighty violinist bolted again from the bed- 
room door. ' Take that, little boy,' he said, ' take that,' 
and he thrust a piece of paper, rolled up into a ball, into 
my hand. It was a bank-note for fifty pounds ! " 

Mr. Sala is not a university man, or even a 
public-school man. With a large fund of gen- 
eral knowledge, he has (like a greater man be- 
fore him) little Latin and less Greek judged 
by Porsonian standards ; nor has his lack of 
scholastic finish escaped the jibes of brother 
writers of double his learning and half his abil- 
ity. His formal schooling was meagre, com- 
prising a season at Paris and a twelvemonth at 
" Bolton House," Turnham Green, the latter 
a " Pestalozzian " establishment where the mak- 
ing of sapphics and alcaics was coupled with 
instruction in carpentry, joinery, gardening, 
and other practical branches, to the no small 
scandal of academic Dr. Blimbers. Among Mr. 
Sala's Paris school-fellows was the younger 
Dumas, then a shapely youth of sixteen, with 
" very light blue-grey eyes, and an abundance 
of very light auburn hair, which curled in a 
frizzled mass." Of Dumas, one story is pre- 
served : 

" Among the articles the use of which was for some 
absurd reason or other forbidden to us pensionnaires, 
was an opera-glass; and young Alexandre Dumas, who 
was once at the back of the pit, and who was naturally 
short-sighted, coolly produced such a forbidden object, 
and began to scan Frederick the Great and his page be- 
hind the foot-lights. The mutinous act was at once 
perceived and resented by the Prefect of Studies. A 
bas le lorgnon, M. Dumas ! a has le lorgnon ! ' he ex- 
claimed in wrathful tones. Unprophetical prefect ! 
Little could the pedant, unendowed with foresight, 
know that the lad who had violated the school regula- 
tions by using a lorgnon was destined to be the author 
of ' Le Demi-Monde ' and ' La Dame aux Came'lias.' " 

At fifteen, Mr. Sala found himself under the 
necessity of " facing the world," with little or 
nothing in the way of capital or marketable 
knowledge to forward the enterprise. After a 
short term with a miniature-painter, he tried in 
turn law-copying, scene-painting, translating, 
illustrating Penny Dreadfuls (" there must be 
more blood, Mr. Sala much more blood ! " 
was the great editorial requirement of this 
branch), engraving, scribbling, and what not, 
leading a rather " loaferish " life the while, and 



decidedly not one lying along the shores of a 
Pactolus. Dire at times were Mr. Sala's fiscal 
straits, and manifold his shifts to relieve them. 
We find him at one stage reduced to the hu- 
miliating point of smoking, and even dining, 
vicariously of walking behind smokers of fra- 
grant Havanas to catch an occasional whiff, 
and of staring in at club-windows, where stout 
gentlemen of stall-fed and port-winey aspect 
plied their knives and forks and glowered at 
the dinnerless outsider. At one of these sea- 
sons of gloom he tried to cobble his fortunes by 
pushing those of " The Shaking Quaker's Her- 
bal Pill," designing and engraving the hand- 
bills, etc., and even " taking several boxes of 
Shaking Quakers " himself to reassure a tim- 
orous public. 

Mr. Sala's formal entry into journalism was 
not auspicious. About 1850 he became editor 
and co-proprietor of " Chat," a half-penny 
weekly, in the theoretical " profits " of which 
he was kindly allowed to participate. But there 
were, in practice, no profits ; and, the chief 
owner of " Chat " judiciously absconding, Mr. 
Sala and his associates found themselves " un- 
der the unpleasant necessity of fighting for the 
small change in the till." 

Mr. Sala's lane, like all others, had its turn- 
ing. The decisive turn came with the close of 
the Crimean War, when he was commissioned 
by Dickens to go to Russia in order to write a 
series of descriptive articles for " Household 
Words." His forte soon became apparent. 
From that date on, Mr. Sala's autobiography 
lapses largely into a perhaps unavoidably jum- 
bled record of his adventures in one country 
or another as a press correspondent the reader 
of it being whisked about geographically in a 
way suggesting that at times the writer must 
have been, like the Irishman's bird, "in two 
places at once." From 1856 downwards, wher- 
ever matters of an exciting nature were stir- 
ring wars or rumors of wars, coronations, po- 
litical murders, revolutions, exhibitions, and the 
like journalistically exploitable doings there 
was Mr. Sala in the thick of it with his pencil 
and notebook. He was in America in '634 
and again in '84 ; with Garibaldi in the Tyrol 
in '65 ; at Paris in '67 and in '70 ; in Turkey in 
'67 ; in Russia again in '76 ; in Spain in '75 ; 
in Australia in '84 ; and so on. He saw Victor 
Emmanuel's triumphal entry into Venice, and, 
later, into Rome ; he saw the obsequies of the 
murdered Tsar Alexander II., and the coro- 
nation of his successor; he passed through the 
siege of Paris, and an after-dinner speech by

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Mr. Chauncey Depew and we regret to add 
here that, like most Englishmen, he declines to 
indorse Mr. Depew's post-prandial wit. Says 
Mr. Sala, with that singular insensibility to 
the fine point of our national humor, so often 
noted by Mr. Howells, Professor Matthews, and 
others : 

" Mr. Chauncey Depew made a great point in his 
speech by saying that I was going to Australia by way 
of Portland, in the State of Maine: a city which I never 
had the pleasure of visiting; but he repeated the asser- 
tion over and over again, and every time he reiterated 
it the company laughed uproariously: a circumstance 
which strengthened a long-existing conviction in my 
mind that in after-dinner speaking and ' stage-gagging ' 
you have only to continually repeat something ' What's 
o'clock ? ' or That's the idea ! ' or < How do you feel 
now ? ' or ' Still I am not happy! ' to excite the hilarity 
of your hearers." 

From Mr. Sala's anecdotes of Garibaldi we 
select a characteristic one, touching the final 
disposal of that hero's General's uniform, a 
gorgeous affair, much despised by its owner, 
which contrasted queerly enough with the his- 
toric red woollen shirt of campaigning days. 
The General wore the uniform but twice, on 
great state occasions, and that under protest. 

" When he returned to his island home at Caprera, it 
is a comical fact that he presented his General's much- 
gold-laced panoply to his cowherd, who gravely drove 
cattle about the fields of Caprera in this gorgeous mar- 
tial array. Exposure to wind and rain and a scorching 
summer sun very soon reduced the stately garb to a 
lamentable state of seediness ; and the cowherd, who 
preferred freedom of action to being tightly buttoned 
up, always wore the coat open, so as to display a coarse 
canvas shirt, with a red woollen sash round the waist. 
It was the delight of Garibaldi and his friends, when 
they met the cowherd, gravely to salute him in military 
fashion, and hail him as ' mio Generale.' " 

We shall end our poachings on Mr. Sala's 
well-stocked, if somewhat ill-ordered, preserves 
with the story of his encounter with a late no- 
torious character who, by an oversight prob- 
ably, missed inclusion in Mr. Seccombe's recent 
book on " Eminent Scoundrels." In February, 
1889, Mr. Sala received a note written in hot 
haste by Mr. Henry Labouchere, which ran thus : 
" Can you leave everything, and come here 
at once ? Most important business. H. L." 
In a quarter of an hour he was seated in Mr. La- 
bouchere's library. The member for Northamp- 
ton was not alone. 

" Ensconced in a roomy fauteuil a few paces from 
Mr. Labouchere's desk there was a somewhat burly in- 
dividual of middle stature and of more than middle age. 
He looked fully sixty; but his elderly aspect was en- 
hanced by his baldness, which revealed a large amount 
of oval os frontis fringed by grey locks. He had an 
eye-glass screwed into one eye, and was using this op- 
tical aid most assiduously, for he was poring over a copy 



of that morning's issue of the ' Times,' going right down 
one column and apparently up it again; then taking 
column after column in succession; then harking back 
as though he had omitted some choice paragraph; and 
then resuming the sequence of his lecture, ever and 
anon tapping that ovoid frontal bone of his, as though 
to evoke memories of the past, with a little silver pen- 
cil case. I noticed his somewhat shabby-genteel attire; 
and in particular I observed that the hand which held the 
copy of the ' Times ' never ceased to shake. Mr. La- 
bouchere, in his most courteous manner and his blandest 
tone said, Allow me to introduce you to a gentleman 

of whom you must have heard a great deal, Mr. ' 

I replied, ' There is not the slightest necessity for nam- 
ing him. I know him well enough. That's Mr. Pigott.' 
. . . Mr. Labouchere continued: 'The fact is that Mr. 
Pigott has come here quite unsolicited, to make a full 
confession. I told him that I would listen to nothing 
save in the presence of a witness, and remembering 
that you lived close by, I thought you would not mind 
coming here and listening to what Mr. Pigott has to 
confess, which will be taken down, word by word, from 
his dictation in writing.' " 

The veracious Pigott, ostensibly studying the 
" Times," had clearly been trying to screw his 
faltering courage up to the sticking-point of his 
now famous confession. At length he rose, and 
stood beside Mr. Labouchere's desk. He did 
not change color, says Mr. Sala ; he did not 
blench ; but, at first in a half-musing tone, then 
louder and more fluently, he told his shameful 
story, coolly confessing that he alone had 
forged the letters alleged to have been writ- 
ten by Mr. Parnell, and minutely describing 
the way in which he had done it. Says Mr. 
Sala: 

"No pressure was put upon him; no leading ques- 
tions were asked him ; and he went on quietly and con- 
tinuously to the end of a story which I should have 
thought amazing had I not had occasion to hear many 
more tales even more astounding. He was not voluble, 
but he was collected, clear, and coherent; nor, although 
he repeatedly confessed to forgery, fraud, deception, 
and misrepresentation, did he seem overcome with any- 
thing approaching active shame." 

Commenting on the Pigott confession, Mr. Sala 
concludes : 

" Whether the man with the bald head and the eye- 
glass in the library at Grosvenor Gardens was telling 
the truth or uttering another batch of infernal lies, it is 
not for me to determine." 

Mr. Sala's book amply fulfils its author's 
intent to "give the general public a definite 
idea of the character and the career of a work- 
ing journalist in the second, third, and fourth 
decades of the Victorian era." E G> j^

LITERATURE AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY.* 

When I was a student in Germany, I went 
one morning to my lecture ; and Professor 
Sievers, instead of beginning at once, in the 
rather abrupt professorial manner, on the sub- 
ject of the day, spoke for some minutes on the 
character and the work of Professor Zarncke 
of Leipzig, who had just died. Professor Siev- 
ers had himself been one of Zarncke's students, 
and he wished to make his own students un- 
derstand and feel what the work of his master 
had been to German philology. Later in the 
morning I went to hear a certain privat-docent, 
and he too began his lecture with feeling words 
on the character and scholarship of Zarncke, 
with whom he too had studied, many years after 
Professor Sievers. I was much struck by this 
tribute to the power of the teacher ; it had 
something in it more impressive than the Ju- 
bilaum or the Festschrift. A science that has 
such professors is fortunate ; it is thus that its 
best traditions are kept up, that its real life is 
continued. 

We have to-day very, very few teachers of 
English literature who have exercised any such 
influence over their students as Zarncke exer- 
cised for many years over some of the best 
scholars of Germany. But of these few there 
can be no doubt that Professor Corson is one. 
I do not know who among the younger teach- 
ers of English have ever studied with him ; 
but they know themselves, which is the im- 
portant matter, and their students reap the 
benefit of it. Among all the teachers in Amer- 
ica, I suppose Professor Corson is one of the 
few who are really men of genius. With all 
his eccentricities and mistakes (I speak with 
too much earnestness to have regard to conven- 
tionality), Professor Corson has a keenness of 
insight into the living meaning of things that 
I can compare only with the power of Mr. 
Ruskin, or possibly of Professor Dowden, 
among those now living who have given thought 
and study to the interpretation of literature. 

It is only of recent years that this power 
has come to expression in books. And these 
books, remarkable contributions to criticism 
as they are, do not adequately convey Profes- 
sor Corson's influence. It is therefore an ex- 
cellent thing that he has now endeavored to 
condense the spirit of his teaching into an 
essay called " The Aims of Literary Study." 
It will readily be inferred that I consider the 

*THE AIMS OF LITERARY STUDY. By Hiram Corson, 
LL.D. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



book of extreme value to all interested in the 
subject. It has the great merit of conveying 
successfully just what it attempts to convey. I 
do not think anyone could mistake it. A stu- 
dent of Professor Corson's who reads it feels at 
once a revival of the old fire that was kindled 
when he first went into that stuffy lecture-room 
in White Hall. On others, the effect will per- 
haps hardly be so striking ; but still the book 
will say what it is meant to say. 

The purport of the book will be best given 
by some extracts ; it would lose by the attempt 
to paraphrase. It is very easy to misrepresent 
by means of extracts, but I hope the following 
will give an idea of the direction in which Pro- 
fessor Corson's power has been felt by his 
students. 

" Literature is not a mere knowledge subject, as the 
word knowledge is usually understood, namely, that with 
which the discursive, formulating intellect has to do. But 
it is a knowledge subject (only that and nothing more) if 
that higher form of knowledge be meant, which is quite 
outside of the domain of the intellect a knowledge 
which is a matter of spiritual consciousness and which 
the intellect cannot translate into a judgment. It is 
nevertheless, at the same time, the most distinct and 
vital kind of knowledge " (p. 25). 

" The human spirit is a complexly organized, individ- 
ualized divine force, which in most men is cabined, crib- 
bed, confined; and in consequence, more or less qui- 
escent ; only in a very few does it attain to an abnormal 
quickening such a quickening as leads to a more or 
less direct perception of truth, which is a characteristic of 
genius. But there have always been men, in all times and 
places and in all conditions of life, whose spiritual sen- 
sitiveness has been exceptional men who have served 
as beacons to their fellows. It is the spiritual sensitive- 
ness of the few which has moved the mass of mankind 
forward. . . The intellect plays a secondary part" (p. 39). 

" Being is teaching, the highest, the only quickening 
mode of teaching; the only mode which secures that un- 
conscious following of a superior spirit by an inferior 
spirit of a kindled soul by an unkindled soul. ' Surely,' 
says Walt Whitman, 

' Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her 

I shall follow, 

As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps any- 
where around the globe.' 

And so, to get at the being of a great author, to come 
into relationship with his absolute personality, is the 
highest result of the study of his works " (p. 57). 

" The condition under which our souls silently shape 
themselves to whatever is, spiritually speaking, most 
shapely, outside of ourselves, is that we attain to what 
Wordsworth calls a wise passiveness.' It is a thing to be 
attained to, and a very difficult thing to be attained to, 
especially in these days of stress and strain in temporal 
matters. A wise passiveness. The epithet ' wise ' means 
wise in heart; and a wise passiveness I understand to 
be quite synonymous with the Christian idea of humility 
that is, not a self-depreciation, but, rather, a spontan- 
eous and even unconscious fealty, an unswerving loyalty, 
to what is spiritually above us" (p. 10). 

" How is the best response to the essential life of a

poem to be secured by the teacher from the student ? 
I answer, by the fullest interpretative vocal rendering 
of it. And by < fullest ' I mean that the vocal render- 
ing must exhibit not only the definite intellectual artic- 
ulation or framework of a poem, through emphasis, 
grouping, etc., but must, through intonation, varied qual- 
ity of voice, and other means, exhibit that which is in- 
definite to the intellect. The latter is the main object of 
vocal rendering. A product of the insulated intellect 
does not need a vocal rendering" (p. 99). 

It is impossible to give the full purport of a 
book in half a dozen extracts, yet these quota- 
tions will, I hope, give an approximate notion 
of what Professor Corson would have the teach- 
ing of English literature. He would have it 
a force which should form and strengthen the 
spiritual nature of the student. With his in- 
tellect, in and for itself, it would have nothing 
to do. Spiritual and intellectual, we know 
well enough what the words mean, though it is 
hard to define the precise difference. Now any- 
one can see the value of such suggestions ; the 
difficulty comes in carrying them out. I believe 
there will be many a zealous and practical 
teacher of literature who, having read the book 
thoughtfully, and considered what it implies in 
university teaching nowadays, will lay it down 
with a " This will never do." Such is, in fact, 
my own feeling, to be quite honest. It will not 
do, for university teaching. Professor Cor- 
son's answer will be, " So much the worse for 
the universities and those who are taught 
there." And to see how good is to come out 
of the deadlock requires a wiser head than 
mine. But there are one or two things which 
should be held in mind. 

Universities and colleges at present con- 
cern themselves almost entirely with one only 
of the several elements which should make a 
part of everybody's education. Surroundings, 
conduct, art, religion, these are elements of 
vast importance in education; but with these 
the university does not particularly concern 
itself. Whether this confinement of its sphere 
be for good or ill, may be an open question ; 
but, on the whole, it will be allowed that as a 
matter of fact the university does very largely 
confine itself to science. Some universities are 
devoted to science for its own sake, and not as 
an educational agent. But our American uni- 
versities deal chiefly with science for its edu- 
cational effect. Now the educational effect of 
science is two-fold : it is special, as when a 
man who intends to be a chemist studies chem- 
istry, or as when a man who desires to have 
any sort of information or training pursues the 
particular study that will give him the informa- 



tion and training he desires ; and it is also gen- 
eral, as when we consider the strengthening 
and formative effect of university study as a 
whole. In these two directions tends almost all 
university study. It educates a man in partic- 
ular branches of knowledge, and it gives him 
also the discipline of scientific thinking. Those 
things which cannot be brought under one or 
another head do not, as a rule, have any place 
in university curricula. Many excellent edu- 
cational forces have no place in university curri- 
cula. Conduct, surroundings, art, religion, 
have no formal representation there except as 
dealt with by science. Cardinal Newman, in 
speaking of a certain theory or philosophy, once 
said : " Where it prevails, it is as unreasonable 
to demand for religion a chair in a university, 
as to demand one for fine feeling, sense of hon- 
our, patriotism, gratitude, maternal affection, 
or good companionship, proposals which would 
be simply unmeaning." The university, in 
other words, is commonly regarded as the train- 
ing-school for the intellect. And in no scheme 
for intellectual training alone does Professor 
Corson's literary study find any place ; he 
would be the first to say so. Whether it should 
be so, is another matter. That it is so, is fully 
understood by Professor Corson, as we see by 
his treatment of that essential feature of the 
present university system, the examination. 
The university concerns itself with intellectual 
training ; its whole system, and method, and 
discipline is designed for intellectual training. 
Other educational forces it deals with only in- 
cidentally ; they must look out for themselves. 

So the matter stands at present. Literature 
is, in a manner, out of place in the universities. 
Every good teacher of literature has felt it a 
hundred times. The study of language is one 
thing ; but the study of literature as one of 
the fine arts, save as a branch of history or 
psychology, is not a university discipline. Ef- 
forts to make it such result to the detriment of 
literature as an art. And that gives the re- 
lation of Professor Corson's book to present 
university teaching. 

One thing further : In spite of much that 
may be said, it does not seem to me that the 
present is a time in which the intellect is ac- 
corded too high a place of honor. I should 
say, on the other hand, that comparatively few 
people nowadays have had the advantage of an 
education which has enabled them to use their 
intellects to full advantage. The time is not 
overburdened with thought ; or if it is, the 
trouble lies with those who would like to think.

The schools may be full of ridiculous analytic 
method in the name of thought, but the world 
is full of ridiculous mental processes of no name 
at all. One may be heartily in sympathy with 
Professor Corson's enthusiasm for spiritual ed- 
ucation, and yet not acknowledge that we have 
too much intellectual education. Or we may 
have too much of it, but it isn't of the right 
sort. The question is not one of substitution. 
We must keep on doing one thing (do it better 
if only we could), and not leave the other un- 
done. 

I have tried to show clearly the place of this 
book of Professor Corson's in our thinking 
about education. It is a very small book 
in fact, it is an 18mo. I wish it were larger, 
for it ought to hold a place of dignity on the 
book-shelf alongside of works of greater size but 
less excellence. In its present shape, however, 
it will be easier to bind it upon the tablet of 
the heart which is rather more to the purpose.

AN UNSUCCESSFUL, HISTORY.* 



President Andrews, of Brown University, 
has written a history of the United States, in 
two volumes. It begins with pre-historic Amer- 
ica and ends with the Congress of 1894. A 
book of this scope, written in good style, giv- 
ing cleverly an outline of facts for the four 
centuries in which America has been known, 
has long been needed. We have school texts, 
and long scholarly histories ; but practically 
nothing of moderate compass, at once accurate 
and readable. The series of three little vol- 
umes edited by Professor Hart of Harvard are 
scholarly, truthful, and in every way admira- 
ble ; but it may be that the form and the 
method will not make them attractive to the 
general reader. President Andrews has en- 
deavored to satisfy the need of such a work. 
The disagreeable task of recording his failure 
is thrust upon the reviewer. 

The author gives seven reasons for the ap- 
pearance of these volumes. Among them are 
these : This history is believed to utilize, "more 
than any of its predecessors, the many valuable 
researches of recent years into the rich ar- 
chives of this and other nations"; he has sought 
to make prominent not only the political evo- 
lution, but the social habits and life of the peo-

drews, D.D.,LL. D., President of Brown University. In two

pie ; " the work strives to observe scrupulous 
proportion in treating the different phases of 
our national career "; " no pains has been 
spared to secure perfect accuracy in all refer- 
ences to dates, persons, and places, so that the 
volume may be used with confidence as a work 
of reference." These are laudable endeavors ; 
but candor compels us to say that they have 
never blossomed into actuality, and that the 
failure of the book is noteworthy in these very 
particulars. 

Whether or not scrupulous proportions have 
been observed is of course a matter of judg- 
ment, and there must be differences of opinion. 
But it seems to me that, in spite of the import- 
ance of the Civil War, a seventh of the whole 
work is too much to devote to its considera- 
tion. There is no space for a discussion of 
the Hutchinson controversy in Massachusetts, 
whereas there is a page given to " Wigs " in the 
chapter on " Social Culture." The chapter on 
" American Manhood in the Revolution " is 
well written, but space might have been found 
for the statement that all of the Americans 
were not Whigs, for we are loth to attribute 
to any reason save want of space the fact that 
the Loyalists are not mentioned. Of course 
this leaves the impression that the American 
Revolution was a vast national uprising, in 
which everyone entered heart and soul. Space, 
it seems, might also have been given, if only 
a line or two, to an admission that we did not 
always whip the British frigates and schooners 
in the war of 1812. Common fairness demands 
this, much as we love to lay the flattering unc- 
tion to our souls that our Yankee sailors in 
many a hard-fought battle proved to the arro- 
gant English tar that he had not acquired a 
monopoly of the ocean. The difference be- 
tween a well and an ill proportioned book may 
be seen by comparing Professor Hart's " Form- 
ation of the Union " with President Andrews's 
treatment of the same period. 

That the author has not succeeded in his en- 
deavor to bring out the " political evolution " 
of the country, is as striking as anything else. 
His treatment of the formation and develop- 
ment of the Republican party, for example, 
leaves almost everything to be desired. A chap- 
ter on the Whig party, which is introduced im- 
mediately after the war of 1812, will leave the 
average reader hopelessly at sea. The word 
Whig was not used until after 1830. It is dis- 
tressing to find Webster's defence of the com- 
promise of 1850 treated of before the Missouri 
compromise. Some regard for chronology is

desirable in a popular work. Federalism and 
anti - federalism are neither adequately nor 
clearly treated. The difference between strict 
and loose constructions is thus given : " In 
matters relating to the powers of the general 
government, ought any unclear utterance of the 
Constitution to be so explained as to enlarge 
those powers, or so as to confine them to the 
narrowest possible sphere ? " Surely a consider- 
ation of Hamilton's famous defence of the 
Bank Bill, and of Jefferson's attack upon it, 
might have begotten a more distinct and schol- 
arly statement than this. But in this, as in 
nearly everything else, the book betokens haste. 
The author has not taken the time either to 
turn to the opinions of the men in this famous 
controversy, or to formulate for himself a clear 
and thoughtful definition of the doctrine of 
implied powers. 

The effort to have this volume strictly accu- 
rate " in all references to dates, persons, and 
places " has not been successful. Complete and 
absolute accuracy is perhaps not a possibility 
for anyone; but the author of this book might 
have achieved greater success in his attempt to 
reach the unattainable had he been careful and 
slow. Space will not be taken to give a list of all 
the mistakes. The following examples will suf- 
fice : Of the five maps, three have gross errors 
and a fourth is misleading. The worst is per- 
haps the map purporting to show the " United 
Colonies at the beginning of the Revolution." 
There never was such a country thus divided. 
The map bears on its face marks of its own 
absurdity. The Northwest Territory, for ex- 
ample, organized in 1787, is found on this map. 
The Southwest Territory is there as well. And 
yet Tennessee had been admitted by the time 
the Territory of Mississippi was formed, 
although this also finds its place here. Other 
mistakes in the map need not be mentioned. 
On the map showing the progressive acquisition 
of territory, West Florida is given as part of 
Louisiana. It is true, we claimed it as part of 
our purchase from France ; but modern re- 
search has shown that our claim and our seizure 
were unjustified by any sound title. The map 
introduced to illustrate the "United States af- 
ter the admission of Arkansas " is misleading. 
The author may have had the right idea, but 
the purpose of a map is graphically to show 
facts. What is here called the "Northwest 
Territory not yet admitted," was Michigan 
Territory. Florida was not yet a State in the 
Union, as it here appears to be. 

It may be worth while to point out a few 



other inaccuracies. It is not a pleasant task to 
make a review chiefly a list of blunders, but 
only a recital of some of these can serve to sub- 
stantiate a final judgment on the book. Colum- 
bus did not die in 1505 ; nor is it by any means 
certain that the " Columbus remains till re- 
cently at Havana" are "those of his son Diego." 
The following statement concerning the found- 
ing of Massachusetts is, to say the least, inaccu- 
rate : " Boston was made the capital. Soon em- 
igrants came, and Charlestown was founded." 
As a matter of fact, the founders passed from 
Charlestown to Boston. The year 1638 is not 
generally accepted as the date of the founding 
of Harvard College. McHenry was not " sec- 
ond Secretary of War." The first Congress 
did not establish the mint. It is flattery to say 
that Jefferson was " ardent for the Constitu- 
tion " while it was before the people for adop- 
tion. France gained possession of Louisiana 
in 1800, not 1801. The author gives the price 
which we paid for this accession to our terri- 
tories as eighty millions of francs, " we to as- 
sume in addition the French spoliation claims 
of our citizens." As a matter of fact, the price 
was sixty millions of francs, to be taken by 
France in the form of United States bonds for 
$11,250,000. We were also to pay the debts 
which France owed to American citizens ; these 
were estimated at $3,750,000, or twenty mil- 
lions of francs, the whole sum being $15,000,- 
000, or eighty millions of francs. Again, a 
glance at a trustworthy map would have pre- 
cluded the author from saying that Harrison 
pursued Proctor " up the River Thames to a 
point beyond Sandwich." Sandwich is not on 
the Thames, but several miles south of the 
mouth of that river. At St. Glair's defeat the 
Indians were not " under the redoutable Jos- 
eph Brant." There is some evidence that Brant 
was there and gave some advice to the head 
chieftain, but the Indians were under Little 
Turtle. It is not just accurate to say that the 
fort on the Maumee Rapids was " still held, 
fifty miles within our lines." The fort was not 
built till 1794. It is difficult to determine 
what the author could have had in mind when 
he says : " By 1840 nearly all the land of the 
United States this side the Mississippi had been 
taken up by settlers." There is a very evident 
misprint, such as might escape anyone, on page 
361 of Volume I. Marshall was not one of the 
signers of the Treaty of Ghent. Genet was 
not succeeded by Adet ; Fauchet intervened. 
The tables of population of the Colonies are 
misleading. It is absolutely impossible to give

exact figures, and it is perhaps not too much to 
ask that the author give some indication that 
his statements are only estimates. The words 
about the famous Ordinance of 1787 are so 
wrong and misleading that they are worth 
quoting : 

"July 13, 1787, Congress adopted for the govern- 
ment of the Territory the famous Ordinance of 1787. 
It provided for a governor, council, and judges, to be 
appointed by Congress, and a house of representatives 
elected by the people. Its shining excellence was a 
series of compacts between the States and the Terri- 
tories, which guaranteed religious liberty, made grants 
of land and other liberal provisions for schools and col- 
leges, and forever prohibited slavery in the Territory 
or the States which should be made out of it." 

A comparison between these statements and 
the words of the famous Ordinance would be 
interesting. 

There are good things to be said about these 
volumes. The language is at times terse and to 
the point. Whenever the author has taken the 
time to look up his materials and to arrange 
them, he has shown power in narration and 
great vigor in description. In spite of the 
roughness of the style, one is often hurried 
along with a sense of genuine pleasure, and is 
at times aroused to real enthusiasm. This 
power has its dangers ; for the writer of a 
popular narrative is always tempted to make 
sweeping assertions, and to declare in broad 
phrases a mixture of truth and fiction which is 
more characteristic of the historical novel than 
of history. 

One would like to be able to say that, in 
spite of occasional errors in fact, the generali- 
zations and final judgments of these volumes 
are sound and trustworthy, and that the nar- 
rative is so arranged that the reader is led to 
a judicious and sensible comprehension of the 
drift and scope of our history. But it is im- 
possible to reach that decision. The book has 
been written in the utmost haste, at a reckless 
rate of speed, and the indications are apparent 
on almost every page. Careful and thorough 
revision may do something to correct blunders, 
modify paradoxical judgments, and give se- 
quence and clearness to the narration.

SOME RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION.* 



The first four books in our present list had, in a 
general sense, the same origin. This is described in 
the common preface that introduces them to the 
reader. This preface, which is signed by Mr. R. D. 
Roberts, recites that the Gilchrist Trustees, for whom 
he is Secretary, decided, in the early part of 1893, 
to send five women teachers to the United States, 
for the purpose of studying and reporting upon sec- 
ondary schools for girls, and training colleges for 
women, in different parts of the country ; being 
moved thereto by the growing interest in secondary 
education in the United Kingdom and the import- 
ant problems there awaiting solution. The Trustees 
made their intention widely known, and invited the 
governing bodies of the various women's colleges 
and associations of teachers to submit to them names 
of persons specially qualified to undertake such a 
mission. From the list of names thus furnished, 
after careful consideration of the qualifications of 
the candidates, the Trustees elected the five ladies 
whose names appear on the title-pages of these books, 
and awarded to each of them 100 to enable them 
to spend two months in the United States in prose- 
cuting their inquiries. The five scholars made their 
visits as proposed, and on their return home sub- 
mitted carefully prepared reports of what they had 
seen. The Trustees have aided also in the publi- 
cation of the reports, believing that a knowledge of 
educational systems and experiments that have been 
tried in America cannot fail to be of interest and 
value to teachers in the United Kingdom. These 
facts we have stated, not merely because they serve to

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



explain the appearance at the same time, from the 
same publishing houses, of four works on such closely 
related subjects, but more especially because they 
suggest the remark that holders of educational trusts, 
and other persons interested in education, in this 
country, could render the cause they have at heart 
a service by emulating the example of the Gilchrist 
Trustees. While the practice is by no means an un- 
known one in our educational annals, it is still one 
that might be extended with much advantage. 

Before the embassy left England, it was found 
advisable, in view of the magnitude of the task, 
somewhat to divide the responsibility; three of its 
members undertook to visit and report upon insti- 
tutions offering the means of general education, 
while the other two occupied themselves exclusively 
with investigating the provision made in the United 
States for the training of teachers. 

The four, or rather five, reports are such in the 
strict sense of the term; they are primarily books 
of facts, statistics, information, rather than argu- 
ment and criticism. Page on page is filled with lit- 
eral transcriptions of courses of study, programmes, 
time-tables. The writers seek to inform their coun- 
trymen in respect to matters that, they think, should 
interest them, and not to correct the shortcomings 
of American teachers and educationalists. We see 
no trace of that self-consciousness which listens for 
an American reflection. While we meet with many 
errors of detail in all the reports, as is natural, we 
cannot doubt the desire of their writers to get at 
the exact truth. When they overlap, they do not 
always agree in facts or conclusions, owing partly, 
but not wholly, to the fact that their observations 
in some measure lay in different fields. Miss Page, 
for instance, observes: "Speaking generally, the 
impression that I received was not only that origin- 
ality and individuality were allowed full play [in 
the schools] where they were good, but that the 
course of study, followed up as it is with frequent 
supervision, proved a great corrective of the mis- 
takes which so often take place in the hands of a 
weak teacher." Miss Zimmern, on the other hand, 
thought too little liberty was left to teachers. " It 
is believed that careful supervision and superin- 
tendence may do much toward obtaining good work 
from a merely average teacher; and as the great 
majority of the American teachers are untrained, 
and may have had no teaching beyond that of the 
High School, and not always that, some such sys- 
tem is absolutely necessary to keep up the standard 
of work. It appears, on the whole, to work well 
and economically, though it is impossible that it 
should not sometimes be galling for a really capable 
, teacher to have to follow such minute directions as 
are laid down in many of the courses of study." 
We need hardly say which of these writers saw 
farther into the general conditions actually existing. 

It must not be supposed, however, that the re- 
ports contain no criticism. The two or three stronger 
ones contain plentiful discussion, put often in the 



form of comparisons of selected points in English 
and American educational practice. As a result, 
the American reader who is not already informed 
upon the subject will find in them much useful in- 
formation in respect to English schools, teachers, 
and methods. Still, the great point of interest for 
such reader will, no doubt, be the impression which 
our systems made on the minds of the five culti- 
vated English ladies, all practical teachers, and all 
intent on discovering what they could that might 
prove advantageous to themselves and their co- 
workers in the good cause. 

All the ladies seem to have been deeply impressed 
by the depth of enthusiasm for education that they 
met with everywhere. Miss Burstall thinks the 
causes are these: The democratic constitution of 
the country ; the estimate put upon the public school 
as a means of assimilating the vast foreign emigra- 
tion and as a pledge of national homogeneity ; and 
education as a means of preserving the ideal and 
spiritual elements of human life in the midst of a 
material civilization. 

We have been particularly interested in the re- 
marks made by several of the writers about the 
teaching of English and English literature as they 
saw it in our schools. Miss Zimmern thought the 
general standing of English language teaching low, 
but was especially impressed by the excellence of 
the literature. We venture to quote one of her 
most interesting and suggestive pages. 

" The teaching of English literature in America pos- 
sesses peculiar interest for the English visitor. If it is 
true that to understand Old England, we ought to see 
New England, where many of our old customs are still 
fresh and living, it is equally true that if we want to find 
a real living love for our English Classics, we had better 
seek it in the United States than on this side of the water. 
In many of our schools there is hardly such a thing as 
literature teaching at all. There is a lesson bearing 
that name on most time-tables, but it is often a lesson 
in language, not always of a systematic character, a great 
part of the time being given to studying etymology of out- 
of-the-way words, and discussing little of unimportant 
details in set books. This deterioration in our literature 
teaching is due to the too successful attempt to make 
literature an examination subject, coupled with the dis- 
astrous system of prescribing set books to be read, re- 
read, criticised, paraphrased, patronized, and found fault 
with by young immature critics. The whole aim of lit- 
erature teaching to train the inind to love of the beau- 
tiful, is forgotten in the necessity of cramming notes 
for examination. Reverence and awe, which it should 
produce in young minds by the presentation of the beau- 
tiful, is exchanged for a desire to spy faults quickly, 
and thus gain marks on questions set in the examination 
about Shakespeare's inconsistency, anachronisms, mis- 
interpretations of history, etc." 

Not second in interest to any of the other volumes 
is the one containing the parallel reports of Miss 
Bramwell and Miss Hughes on the training of 
teachers. The two ladies travelled together, but 
have made separate reports, each writing in total 
ignorance of what the other was saying. 

All the books are written in an appreciative but

THE DIAL 



115 



temperate spirit. There is no fulsomeness or exag- 
geration on the one part, or detraction on the other. 
Miss Bramwell, for example, sums up her observa- 
tions of the training of teachers in this self-contained 
manner : 

" 1. That the State Normal Schools, adhering to old 
traditions, and failing to insist on adequate and thor- 
ough scholarship as an entrance qualification, have been 
obliged to devote themselves, either to securing that 
scholarship, or to the pursuance of so-called training 
under conditions the most conductive to mechanical 
lines of work and dead forms of method. 

"2. That the City Training Schools, being entirely 
local institutions, supported by local funds, and only 
supplying teachers to the schools of the vicinity, are in 
danger of being cramped in their methods by seeking 
to win public favor. 

"3. That the University Departments of Pedagogy, 
especially those belonging to State Universities, are capa- 
ble of affording the widest and best opportunities for the 
thorough training of primary and secondary teachers, 
and in supplying these opportunities, they will not only 
help forward the cause in which they are immediately 
engaged, but afford a valuable means of unifying and 
stimulating education generally." 

If one were searching for the most striking evi- 
dence of the great growth of interest in education 
in this country the last few years, he would perhaps 
find it in the series of volumes bearing the collec- 
tive title of "The International Education Series." 
It must have required no little faith, on the part of 
editor and publishers, to undertake so extensive a 
scheme; and experience has amply justified them. 
The first volume of the series appeared in 1886 ; 
the last one is the twenty-ninth in order, and still 
others are to come. We are not, indeed, shut up to 
the conclusion that so extensive a series was neces- 
sarily contemplated, and are quite at liberty to sup- 
pose that, had it been less successful, but few vol- 
umes would have appeared ; but the editor's origi- 
nal announcement shows that the whole plan lay in 
his mind as clear in 1886 as it does to-day. He is 
to be congratulated, and his publishers also, on the 
success of the enterprise. 

Quite the most notable of the three latest contri- 
butions to the series is that on " The Education of 
the Greek People, and Its Influence on Civiliza- 
tion." Some time ago, Professor Davidson, in his 
admirable work entitled " Aristotle and the Ancient 
Educational Ideals," as he says, " set forth the facts 
of Greek education in historical order"; while his 
present purpose is to " show how the Greek people 
were gradually educated up to that stage of culture 
which made them the teachers of the whole world, 
and what the effect of that teaching has been." 
The one book gives a more objective or external 
view, the other a more subjective or internal one. 
The two, therefore, supplement each other ; and it 
is unfortunate that they could not have appeared in 
the same series. While we find it quite impossible 
to give to the present volume the space that it richly 
deserves, we cannot refrain from calling particular 
attention to the Introduction, which is one of the 



clearest and most satisfactory pieces of educational 
writing that we have recently seen. For a long 
time there has been an infinite amount of talking 
and writing about "nature" and "the natural" in 
education, much the larger part of which has been 
done by men who either had no clear ideas of the 
terms they used, or who failed to express them. 
With these ideas, this Introduction deals in the most 
lucid and convincing manner. The writer begins 
with telling us that, as applied to living things, the 
word "nature" is used in two senses. "In one 
sense, it is the character or type with which a thing 
starts on its separate career, and which, without any 
effort on the part of that thing, but solely with the 
aid of natural forces, determines that career." The 
acorn, bean, chick, and whelp, are given as exam- 
ples. " In the other sense, ' nature ' means that high- 
est possible reality which a living thing, through a 
series of voluntary acts, originating within or with- 
out it, may be made to attain." Thus the rose, the 
orange, the dog, may be brought to such ideal or 
"natural" perfection through the acts of man; 
while man himself, partly through the acts of others, 
and partly through his own self-activity, attains his 
own perfection. These natures may be called, the 
one "original" and the other "ideal"; and it is in 
the line of the second one that the work of edu- 
cation lies. "The aim of education is to develop 
man's ideal nature, which may be, and very often 
is, so different from his original nature that, in or- 
der to make way for the former, the latter may 
have to be crossed, defied, and even to a large ex- 
tent suppressed." This is going to the root of the 
matter. The very important distinction between 
education and erudition is drawn, and then followed 
up by these wise words : 

" It is the failure to draw this necessary distinction 
between education and erudition that is misleading our 
universities into the error of allowing students to ' elect ' 
specialties before they have completed the cycle of ed- 
ucation; the result of which is that we have few men 
of thorough education or of broad and comprehensive 
views. If this evil is ever to be remedied, our univer- 
sities will be obliged, either to abandon this practice, or 
else to give up all attempt to impart education, and de- 
vote themselves solely to erudition, leaving the other to 
academies, gymnasia, or the like." 

In narrating " The Evolution of the Massachu- 
setts Public School System," Mr. Martin unlike 
Mr. Davidson has given us, not a book of thoughts, 
but a book of facts and comments. And very in- 
teresting and important facts and comments they 
are. They give us a clear and just view of the 
evolution of the public school system of Massachu- 
setts, which, when all is told, is the most complete 
system that we have to offer to the attention of the 
world. The writer shows conscientious industry in 
collecting facts, skill in narration, and also a con- 
siderable facility in literary illustration, whereby 
he renders interesting a subject that could easily be 
made tedious and repellant. His book, no doubt, 
grew out of a pitched battle over public-school pio-

neering, which Mr. Martin and President Draper 
waged a year or more ago in the pages of " The 
Educational Review "; but the book is thoroughly 
good in tone, and is in no sense keyed to the con- 
troversial note. There is much need of similar 
books devoted to other States, and particularly the 
State of Connecticut. The State Monographs pub- 
lished by the Bureau of Education, while good in 
their way, still leave much to be desired in complete- 
ness of treatment. 

No competent judge will claim that the efforts 
that have been made in the last ten or twenty years 
to give efficient science-teaching in the schools have 
been as successful or satisfactory as could be de- 
sired. Possibly science-teaching has some intrinsic 
difficulties ; certainly school managers have not been 
able to obtain, even when they desired to do so, the 
services of competent science teachers, in adequate 
numbers. It takes time to introduce a great sub- 
ject, and still more a great group of subjects, into the 
schools in such a way as to obtain from it the best 
educational results. Of the several manuals look- 
ing to the proper preparation of science teachers 
that we have seen, Mr. Howe's " Systematic Sci- 
ence Teaching " is the most complete. It shows 
the marks of large experience and great labor on 
the part of its author. While only an expert, or a 
competent teacher who has thoroughly tried the 
book, can pass authoritatively on its merits, any- 
one who has a good general knowledge of the work 
of schools and teaching can see at a glance that 
even the common teacher has here a whole maga- 
zine of hints and suggestions that he can reduce to 
immediate practice, even if he never becomes able 
to use the whole apparatus of method which the 
author has provided. R A> HlNSDALE . 



SKEAT'S GREAT EDITION OF CHAUCER.* 

Since Chalmers published, in 1810, his edition of 
Chaucer's Complete Works, in prose and verse, with 
the addition of a good deal of spurious matter, no 
scholar has till now dared to edit a complete Chaucer. 
And it was well that they waited ; because it is only 
by the tremendous preliminary work of Dr. Furnivall 
that a new and worthy edition of Chaucer has been 
made possible. Perhaps Dr. Furnivall was not the 
first to recognize the fact that complete possession of 
all the authoritative manuscripts of Chaucer was es- 
sential before a new edition could be undertaken ; 
but certainly to his unparalleled energy was due the 
foundation of the Chaucer Society (in 1868), which 
made possible the magnificent Six-text edition of 
"The Canterbury Tales" (1877), the faithful ed- 
ition of the Harleian MSS. (1885), the parallel texts 
of the "Minor Poems" (1880), the editions of 
"Troilus" (1882), of "Boece" (1886), etc. 

* THE, COMPLETE WORKS OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER. Ed- 
ited from numeroiw Manuscripts, by the Rev. Walter W. 
Skeat, Litt.D., LL.D., etc. In six volumes. Oxford : The 
Clarendon Press. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



On the basis of this work of Dr. Furnivall rests 
Professor Skeat's new and great edition of Chaucer. 
The just reputation of Professor Skeat as a thor- 
ough and admirable scholar in Early English, as 
one of the best annotators of Early English texts, 
his previous editions of Piers Plowman, of Barbour, 
of Chaucer's " Minor Poems " and " Legend of 
Good Women," of several of the " Canterbury 
Tales," his " Etymological Dictionary," and the 
learning displayed in these and other works, justified 
high expectations upon the announcement of this new 
complete edition of Chaucer. And now, that the 
six volumes have been published, we can justly 
say that they form the best edition extant, and the 
best edition ever published ; that they represent an 
edition for which not only every " general reader " 
of a high order, but also every scholar, must be 
grateful. I wish to lay additional stress on this 
preliminary statement, because some of the follow- 
ing detailed remarks, which represent the dark side 
of the picture only, might seem to clash somewhat 
with this favorable judgment. 

The first volume consists of some introductory 
matter, a short biography, a list of Chaucer's works, 
and contains besides the text of the " Romaunt of 
the Rose " and of the minor poems, with introduc- 
tions. In the annalistic biography I do not miss 
anything ; but when, under 1373, Dr. Skeat says 
of Chaucer's first visit to Italy, " All that is known 
of this mission is that he visited Florence as well 
as Genoa, and that he returned before Nov. 22, 
1373, on which day he received his pension in per- 
son," he does not lay sufficient stress on the fact, 
brought to light by Dr. Furnivall in 1873, and men- 
tioned by Skeat only in a note, that Chaucer's ac- 
counts of this journey run for the period between 
Dec. 1, 1372, to May 23, 1373. It would be strange 
indeed if these accounts had stopped in the midst 
of his journey. The more natural interpretation 
seems to be, that Chaucer's journey did not last 
more than six months ; and so this document would 
corroborate what Professor Lounsbury expressed, 
for the first time I think, in the introduction to his 
edition of the " Parliament of Foules " that Chau- 
cer had no time to learn Italian in Italy, but was 
sent there just because of his knowledge of the 
Italian language. Besides, the document seems to 
show that Chaucer returned months before the 22d 
of November, there being no evidence that he stayed 
longer than May 23. The burden of proof, then, 
rests upon those who assume the later date. 

When Mr. Skeat (p. liii.) " confidently " dates 
the coarser passages of " The Canterbury Tales " 
after 1387, the date of the death of Chaucer's wife, 
because his wife, Mr. Skeat seems to suppose, kept 
him at the apron-strings of prudery, I cannot sup- 
press a mischievous counter-conjecture that possibly 
Mrs. Chaucer, like many other worthy ladies of her 
time, would by no means have objected to the pro- 
logue of the " Wife of Bath," and many another 
passage which would not do in a " coeducational " 
Chaucer class.

THE DIAL

The paragraph headed " Personal Allusions," in 
which Dr. Skeat includes matters relating to the 
person of the poet, seems to me far from complete. 
I miss a mention of Ballerstedt's careful essay on 
Chaucer's descriptions of nature, an essay which 
contains matter that Dr. Skeat might have made use 
of to advantage. Moreover, some observations on 
Chaucer's humor, on his theory of life, more satis- 
factory references to his religious views, etc., would 
have been desirable. Among the " Historical Allu- 
sions," no mention is made of Harry Bailey, the 
record of whose parliamentary career was first made 
public (as far as I know) by Rendle and Norman 
in their charming book on " The Inns of Old South- 
wark." A quotation from this book on the " Ta- 
bard Inn " would have formed a welcome addition 
to this chapter. I am sorry, too, that Mr. Skeat, 
in his paragraph on the portraits of Chaucer, does 
not aim at greater completeness ; and that in his 
paragraph on "Allusions to Chaucer," he does not 
give a fuller list of Lydgate's references to his 
" Maister." This would belong, of course, more to 
the long-expected volume to be called " Chaucer's 
Praise "; but in the mean time fuller information on 
this subject would have been very welcome. 

The chronological "List of Chaucer's Works," 
(p. Ixii.) is too meagre ; and Dr. Skeat's words, that 
the list is " arranged as nearly as [he] can conjec- 
ture," are misleading. Dr. Skeat is not the first to 
make conjectures about the chronology of Chaucer's 
writings ; and the best conjectures, even of a Pro- 
fessor Skeat, would not go a long way if they were 
not based on or supplemented by the serious work 
of other scholars. As in the third volume, in the 
introduction to the " Legend of Good Women," we 
find Ten Brink's chronology quoted, we may ask, 
why did Mr. Skeat not save space by combining the 
two lists ? and why did he not heighten the value of 
this list by adding a full account of the work of his 
predecessors in this line ? If he had given a synopsis 
of conjectural dates, references to the sources and 
to his own reasons, he would have done an instructive, 
a highly interesting, and a necessary piece of work. 
A careful study of the question would also have 
disclosed to him the fact, which, as far as I know, 
has not yet been recognized, that a French period 
of Chaucer's work (but no Italian period) had been 
suggested long ago by Pauli, years before Ten 
Brink's epoch-making book. Inasmuch as, accord- 
ing to Dr. Skeat's own confession, Ten Brink's 
Skeat till 1887 (although Dr. Furnivall had pub- 
" Studien " (1870) remained unknown to Professor 
lished a translation of the results of Ten Brink's 
Chaucer-chronology in 1871), we fully believe that 
Mr. Skeat arrived at his conclusions independently ; 
but it is in the nature of scientific investigation that 
a man cannot do everything alone, that he must 
have the same great principle as our friend the clerk 
of Oxenford, who " gladly wolde lerne and gladly 
teche." The work of a man like Ten Brink, who 
was not even an " inevitable German," but a Dutch- 
man by birth, can be neglected, or slighted, or 



pushed aside, only at the peril of the scholar who 
is guilty of such disregard. Professor Skeat's atti- 
tude in this instance bears an unfortunate resem- 
blance to that of Mr. Sweet in his remarks upon 
supposed followers and in his silence with respect 
to his own predecessors.* 

The introduction to the " Minor Poems " is, as 
far as I can see, a reprint of the introduction to Dr. 
Skeat's former edition ; but what was very good for 
the old edition may be in some respects insufficient 
for a new one, and out of place in it. So, I think, 
Dr. Skeat's paragraphs on " Early Editions of Chau- 
cer's Works," his old description of Stowe's edition, 
his remarks on Caxton's editions, do not belong to 
this place in a complete edition, but to another part 
of the work altogether. Dr. Skeat's list of the 
MSS. (p. 49) would have gained greatly in value 
if he had seen fit to add approximate dates to each 
and every one of the MSS. which he describes, 
not merely to a few. Here again he might have 
reproduced more fully, or considered critically 
(with reasons added), what had been brought to 
light by the labor of Bond, Thompson, Furnivall, 
and others. To give only a few instances, Dr. 
Skeat's description of Ms. Gg 4, 27, does not in- 
clude any date at all ; from Dr. Furnivall's auto- 
types (of leaves 433, 395, 416, 432, etc.) we learn 
the approximate date 1430-40 ; from the autotype 
of leaf 332 we learn 1420-30; from his "Tempo- 
rary Preface " (51 ) we get the date 1430-40 ; and 
the same valuable publication gives us even Dr. 
Furnivall's view of the dialect of the MS. (p. 59). 
Why does Dr. Skeat not quote this ? Thie auto- 
type of one leaf of Add. MS. 10340 informs us 
that the date is about " the first third of the 15th 
Century "; why does Dr. Skeat not quote this ? 
The Tanner MS. 346 Dr. Skeat calls " a fair MS. 
of the 15th Century," a very safe, but too vague 
conclusion ; from Schick's " Temple of Glass " I 
see that some authorities on whom Schick, a care- 
ful scholar, relies, date it between 1400-1420. 
Fairfax MS. 16, Dr. Skeat dates as " of the 15th 
Century"; in Schick I find it dated "about 1440- 
1450 "; now if Dr. Skeat could not accept this date, 
if he regarded it as given on insufficient authority, 
it would have been his duty to state this ; he would 
greatly have obliged many a scholar not living 
within the reach of the English libraries. 

The introductions to the separate " Minor Poems " 
contain the old material, and the same seems to be 
the case with regard to the notes. As in the old 
edition, a good deal of information given in the in- 
troductions is repeated in the notes ; so the explana- 
tion of the " Herines " given on page 62 is repeated 
on p. 461. Likewise at p. 64 we read, " The whole 

* I am here referring to a remark in the preface to Sweet's

that my successors follow me pretty closely. Thus, Kluge 
shows his approval of the way in which I have accomplished 
the difficult task of making a selection from the Laws by re- 
printing my extracts bodily." Unfortunately "The Laws 
of Ine " are to be found in " Leo's Reader," published 
in 1838.

poem (the ' Complaint of Mars ') is supposed to be 
sung by a bird and upon St. Valentine's day "; and 
on p. 495, " The whole of this poem is supposed to be 
uttered by a bird on the 14th of Febr."; and similar 
repetitions are to be found in the introductions and 
the corresponding notes to almost all the poems 
(pp. 80 and 542 ; 82 and 550 ; 85 and 556 ; 86 
and 562 ; 559 ; 88 and 563, etc.). 

The introduction to the " Romaunt of the Rose " 
contains a short history of the question of its au- 
thorship, a sketch which, oddly enough, begins with 
Dr. Skeat's own little essay on the subject pub- 
lished in 1880, and mentions neither Ten Brink's 
observations made in 1870 and 1871 (of which Mr. 
Skeat has known since 1887) nor Professor 
Child's doubts and ingenious conjectures made in 
1870. Did Dr. Skeat not realize that in these ob- 
servations of Ten Brink and Child (as Kaluza also 
observes) the theory by which Dr. Skeat and others 
happen to swear now was virtually stated ? For 
Dr. Skeat, the whole question seems to end with 
Kaluza 's essay, which he apparently regards as 
final. Dr. Skeat does not even mention Ten 
Brink's first view, nor Professor Lounsbury's views, 
which might be supported by other reasons than 
those attacked in Kittredge's study. The bare pos- 
sibility of any hypothesis different from the one 
which he advocates seems never to have dawned 
upon the mind of Professor Skeat. The authorship 
of the " Romaunt of the Rose " seems to be a sub- 
ject on which the views of scholars will change 
from decade to decade. But nevertheless, opinions 
will be pronounced with the utmost confidence and 
with passionate denunciation of opposite views, 
while a modest " if " and " perhaps " will be for- 
gotten for the time being by both parties. 

Dr. Skeat, in a paragraph on the French " Ro- 
man de la Rose," quotes Henry Morley, who is no 
authority on the subject, and fails to mention Lan- 
glois' painstaking and splendid work on the sources 
of the Roman; the oversight of Soltoft-Jensen's 
essay on Alanus and the Roman (" Nordisk Tids- 
krift for Filologi," 10, 3) is more pardonable. In 
the introduction to the " Parliament of Foules," no 
mention is made ( as far as I can see ) of Professor 
Lounsbury's excellent edition ; and when Dr. Skeat 
refers to Koch's actual discovery of the historical 
background of the poem in these words, " See on 
this subject Dr. Koch's discussion of the question in 
Essays on Chaucer," I think that the English lan- 
guage might have expressed the plain fact more 
clearly. Koch " discussed " the question indeed, 
but he is the discoverer of the whole matter, and 
Dr. Skeat merely the copyist. 

Before speaking of the text of the " Minor Poems," 
we should give Mr. Skeat's statement from the 
" General Introduction ": " In each case the best 
copy has been selected as the basis of the text, and 
has only been departed from where other copies af- 
forded a better reading. All such variations, as 
regards the wording of the text, are invariably re- 
corded in the footnotes at the bottom of the page 



. . . but I have purposely abstained from record- 
ing variations of reading that are certainly inferior 
to the reading in the text." These words first ap- 
peared in the prospectus, and I confess to an uneasy 
feeling upon the first reading of them. A great edi- 
tion, utilizing the vast results of the labors of the 
Chaucer Society, ought to utilize them in such a 
manner that the personal element, the personal in- 
terference of the editor, would be reduced to a min- 
imum. What seems an " inferior " reading to me 
may be in the eyes of another the better reading ; 
another may shed a new and clearer light on it ; and 
this new light may bring out a hitherto hidden su- 
periority. De gustibus, etc., too, should be a warning 
against being too positive. How many great schol- 
ars in Shakespeare philology, and elsewhere, have 
shown lamentable lack of taste ! Should we prefer 
Bentley's Milton to the old text? Not even for 
Bentley's sake ! With these principles in mind, I 
have made an examination of Professor Skeat's 
text of the poem " Truth," and give now part of 
the result. 

Of the eighteen texts (seventeen manuscripts and 
Caxton's print) which have been re-published by 
the Chaucer Society, seven are enumerated by Mr. 
Skeat, the other ten (or eleven) are sweepingly re- 
ferred to by the simple word u others." Being my- 
self interested in a certain kind of statistics al- 
though not in that kind which has become part of 
philology nowadays, I require greater accuracy. 
These seven MSS., Mr. Skeat, like Koch before 
him (Anglia 1881, 4, 105 ; edition of Minor Poems, 
1883, p. 24) divides into two groups, one group (I 
suppose) being regarded as " superior," the other as 
" inferior." But taking the test-lines, 2, 6, 8, 10, 
19, 20, as a basis, I have come to the conclusion 
that we have to distinguish at least three, probably 
four, different groups. Taking the Ellesmere MS. 
as a basis, which for " Truth " seems not quite as 
good as the Additional and scarcely better than the 
Phillipps MS., Mr. Skeat's text has in line 2 the 
harsh and not at all " simple " reading : " Suffice 
unto thy good." The reading of the Fairfax MS. 
( " Suffice the thy good ") is given in the note and 
called "capital," but the equally good reading of 
the Phillipps MS. (" Suffise the thyne owne ") is 
ignored, as well as the equally good reading of the 
Add. MS., " Suffise thin owen thing." Although 
Mr. Skeat says of the decidedly bad reading of the 
Ellesmere and other MSS., " The sense is simply 
[ ! ] Be content with thy property, though it be 
small," he does not really explain it, nor does he 
support it by a sufficient parallel quotation. Mr. 
Skeat does not mention the reading "with fastnes" 
(of the second Fairfax copy) ; nor does he quote 
the reading " lyuynge " (of an Add. MS.) in the 
foot-note ; nor does he register the reading of two 
MSS., yf (yef), for "though" in the same first 
line ; and when he says, p. 551. seven MSS. have 
" suffice unto thy good," the seven ought to be 
changed into a ten (or, counting Caxton's print, 
eleven). This inaccuracy seems to be due to Skeat's

not having taken any notice of the texts of " Truth " 
published by the Chaucer Society since the date of 
his first edition of the " Minor Poems." 

In line 4, the reading blynd of two MSS. is not 
quoted, nor is the reading " is blent " of nine MSS. 
registered, by the side of blente of the Phillipps MS. 
In line 5, the reading of the same MS. Favour is 
not registered, nor thou for thee. In the note to 
line 6 we read, " Most MSS. read Werk or Do ; 
only two have Reule ; " but the facts are that four 
MSS. have werke (wirke, wirche}, four MSS. (not 
two, as Mr. Skeat affirms) have Reule (Rewle, 
Rule), two MSS. have rede, seven MSS. have do 
(doo), and one MS. inserts a different line ; the 
adverb weel is omitted by two MSS.; one MS. has 
men for folk (or folkis, one even forkis /). In line 
7, " thee " stands before " delyuere " in fourteen 
MSS.; and the statement of this fact would have 
been more useful than the whole paragraph against 
this reading (p. 551), and indeed, would seem to 
have been necessary at page 390, where the read- 
ing is given as that of one [ ! ] MS., the Trinity 
College MS. In a note to line 8, referring to the 
reading "Tempest thee noght" we are informed that 
Harleian, Fairfax, and Trinity MSS. read Peyne ; 
but there is nothing in these words to suggest the 
fact that Peyne is the reading of seven more MSS. 
that is, of eleven in all ; we do not learn, that 
Tempest is the reading of five MSS.; that one MS. 
has Ne study not, and another Restreyne the not; 
the eche, yche, etc., the croked of six MSS. and the 
every of one MS. are also not registered. In line 
10 for gret reste are quoted four MSS., whereas it 
is the reading of fifteen MSS.! Mych wele occurs 
in the Phillipps MS. as well as in the Add. MS.; 
Meche rest of the Corpus MS. is not mentioned, 
nor the different line in Add. MS. 22139. The 
reading (1. 11) " Bewar therfore " and " Beware 
alsoo " of twelve MSS. for " And eek bewar " is not 
given ; nor the wholly different reading of the Cor- 
pus MS., nor the reading wall of two MSS., nor 
" hille " of one (the latter being a clerical mistake, 
indeed, so that the omission is excusable after 
Skeat's preliminary statement). In line 12, the 
second Add. MS. has a different line, and instead 
of with the wal we have ayens in three MSS. In 
line 13, the reading Deme thiself of Caxton is not 
given, nor the Dawnte ay of the Harl. MS. In line 
19, the reading " Knowe thi contre " is in six MSS.; 
Looke up on hye is the reading of ten MSS. The 
reading of two MSS. lyft wp thyne ene and lyft vp 
thy hert, is as little recorded as the " thank thy 
god " of three MSS. or the " our lorde " of another 
MS., etc., etc. 

The perusal of this list will be no more interest- 
ing to the reader of these lines, I am sure, than the 
careful comparison was to me ; but it helped me to 
form an opinion on the value of the text, and of 
Mr. Skeat's views about the inferiority and superi- 
ority of a reading in general. Should it turn out 
to be a fact, as I sincerely hope it will not, that 
Mr. Skeat's text of all the other poems is as inac- 



curate as his text of " Truth," we should be forced 
to the conclusion that the text, very readable as it 
is, and perhaps sufficient for ordinary purposes, is 
certainly not a final one, and certainly lacks the 
first requirement of a good text a full considera- 
tion and a patient registration of all the MS. ma- 
terial. 

On page 510, Dr. Skeat ought to have inserted, 
instead of the old Dante quotation for the inscrip- 
tion over the gates in the " Parlament of Foules," 
the real original which is to be found in Boccaccio, 
as Koeppel has shown (Anglia 14,233). 

The second volume contains the texts of " Boece " 
and of " Troilus," with introductions and notes. 
In the printing of " Boethius," Mr. Skeat, follow- 
ing the ingenious suggestion of Bradshaw, has given 
Chaucer's explanations in italics. That it was Brad- 
shaw who first suggested this, Mr. Skeat does not 
take the trouble to tell us ; but I learn it from a 
note of Furnivall's in his edition of " Boece," page 
V. It is a pity that Mr. Skeat's introduction does 
not take any notice of Hodgkin's great chapter on 
" Boethius," which, as well as Dahn's results, would 
have modified considerably the old-fashioned Gib- 
bonesque eulogy of Boethius. On page xvi., Dr. 
Skeat quotes the antiquated remark of Bohn on 
the Tavistock print of Walton's " Boethius," not 
knowing that a copy of it is in Magdalen College 
Library, Oxford. He does not mention the ex- 
tracts given from Bracegirdle's " Boethius " in An- 
glia XV. That Mr. Skeat did not use Peiper's edi- 
tion of the original is also a pity. 

The introduction to " Troilus " contains some 
good things, but it is far from complete ; it does not 
even utilize all the material gained from the sources 
in several separate German dissertations (better 
than the average). Professor Skeat says in this 
Introduction : " This is not the place for a full con- 
sideration of the further question as to the sources 
of information whence Boccaccio and Guido re- 
spectively drew their stories. Nor is it profitable 
to search the supposed works of Dares and Dictys 
for the passages to which Chaucer appears to refer ; 
since he merely knew these authors by name, owing 
to Guide's frequent appeals to them." I wonder 
where " the place for a full consideration " of these 
and other questions should be, if not here? Pro- 
fessor Skeat's remarks do not supersede Ten Brink's 
theory with regard to Benoit. 

The third volume contains the " House of Fame," 
the "Legend of Good Women," the "Astrolabe," 
and an introductory essay on the sources of " The 
Canterbury Tales." I miss, under the " Imitations 
of the House of Fame " (a paragraph that is, as 
usual, given twice first in the introduction and 
then in the notes, p. 243, any reference to the 
careful article of Paul Lange on Gawen Douglas 
and Chaucer. It is stranger still that Mr. Skeat 
" is not aware that anyone has ever doubted [his] 
result" as to the Priority of the "A" Prologue of 
the Legend (p. xxi.) Here again Skeat is, un 
fortunately, quoting his old separate edition (p. 



120 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



xiii.), and has taken no notice of Ten Brink's last 
essay. Skeat's comparison of the two forms is in- 
complete (p. xxii.), even overlooking the three al- 
lusions to Chaucer's age, duly noticed by Ten Brink. 
In the note to the " House of Fame," line 1227, 
Holthausen's little essay (Anglia 16, 264) would 
have heen useful. The edition of the " Astrolabe," 
with its notes and diagrams, is excellent, as far as 
I can judge from a very insufficient knowledge of 
astrology. Some chapters on the " Sources of the 
Canterbury Tales " conclude the volume, in which, 
for the first time since Hertzberg and During (whose 
names might have been mentioned here), a complete 
survey of the field has been made. No mention is 
made of Frankel's quotation from Cropacius (An- 
glia XVI. ) in the note on the sources of the " Mil- 
leres Tale," but if we consider the mass of valuable 
information and of careful compilation, any lacuna 
like this is of little consequence. 

The fourth volume begins with some most wel- 
come additions to the " Minor Poems," viz., three 
new poems which Dr. Skeat's eye was fortunate 
enough to discover and recognize as Chaucer's, 
as in the case of the " Rosamounde " a few years 
ago. After these three poems follows the text of 
" The Canterbury Tales," based on the Ellesmere 
MS. In his introduction on the MSS., Mr. Skeat 
is not able to trace the Norton MS., and therefore 
I beg leave to refer him to Mr. Quaritch, in whose 
hands the MS. now is. The MS. is valued at 
$1500, and we hope that some rich American may 
bring it westward. 

The fifth volume begins with some introductory 
matter on the " Canon of Chaucer's Works," which 
might more appropriately have been placed in the 
first volume. Concerning the so-called Tyrwhitt 
edition, first published by Moxon in 1845, there are 
some very just remarks, which are not, however, 
detailed enough to exhibit the exact relation which 
the text of Moxon's " Essay, Discourse, Notes, and 
Glossary " bears to its prototype. Next follow some 
far from exhaustive remarks upon the text of the 
" Canterbury Tales." Then there are some "Rules 
for Reading," practical hints for the modern 
reader who takes Chaucer in hand without previous 
study of his language. The volume is mainly de- 
voted, however, to the Notes to the Canterbury 
Tales. In these, as was to be expected, Dr. Skeat 
appears at his very best. This is the most complete 
commentary on the Tales ; and even if Dr. Skeat 
had never written anything but this commentary, 
it would have been sufficient to ensure the honora- 
ble association of his name with that of his author 
and to win for him the lasting gratitude of Chau- 
cer students. 

The sixth and concluding volume, which comes 
just in time for a brief mention, contains, in a gen- 
eral Introduction, an account of Chaucer's pronun- 
ciation and versification ; a short Chaucer grammar ; 
a glossarial Index on the genuine works, and one 
each for the Gamelyn and the B. C. Fragments of 
the " Romaunt of the Rose." The most interesting 



addition to these is the Index of Proper Names, and 
an Index of Authors quoted or referred to. 

I conclude this notice by recurring to my opinion, 
expressed at the outset, that, notwithstanding all its 
shortcomings, few finer editions of an old English 
classic have ever been published, and that Dr. 
Skeat's edition of Chaucer is by far the best extant.

BBIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Translation of 
a popular life 
of Napoleon. 



Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons issue, in 
a neatly made volume of 140 pages, 
the " Napoleon " of Alexandre Du- 
mas, translated by Mr. J. B. Lamer. Mr. Larner's 
seems to be, oddly enough, the first English version, 
though the original is popular and has a continuous 
sale in France. The book is essentially a very con- 
cise review of Napoleon's public, and more especially 
his military, career political crises being briefly 
touched, while of domestic history and criticism of 
personal character there is next to nothing. About 
thirty pages are given to Waterloo, and half that 
number to Marengo ; of the divorce from Josephine 
we find only an indirect mention of five words. The 
volume opens with a brief sketch of Napoleon's 
school-days and youth, and closes with a touching 
chapter on his five years of torment at St. Helena 
under the wardenship of that excessively small crea- 
ture, Sir Hudson Lowe who remains to this day, 
to the continental mind, the type of a singularly re- 
pellant, and not unfamiliar, class of his countrymen. 
" For five years," says Dumas, forcibly and justly, 
though with a certain hint of bathos, "the modern 
Prometheus remained chained to the rock where 
Hudson Lowe preyed upon his heart." A caged 
tiger teased and fretted, from outside the bars, by 
a spiteful, grimacing monkey, were perhaps a truer 
figure. Dumas saw the Emperor twice the first 
time as he drove by on his way to Ligny, amid the 
acclamations of the populace ; the second time on 
his return from Waterloo, in a frozen and ominous 
silence. "Each time he was seated in the same car- 
riage, on the same seat, dressed in the same coat. 
Each time it was the same vague and unoccupied 
look. Each time it was the same face, calm and 
impassable, only his head was a little more inclined 
upon his chest in returning than in going." Mr. 
Larner has tried to make his translation as literal as 
possible ; and while the general result is satisfactory, 
there are occasional nawe renderings which smack 
a little of the humors of the class-room. For in- 
stance, we find General Paoli pronouncing Bona- 
parte "a young man of old-fashioned shape"; and 
we are told that the besiegers of Toulon, " whose 
eyes darted into the city and upon the road, saw the 
conflagration," etc. Without comparing them with 
the original, we venture to say that these and sev- 
eral other like phrases could be polished a little with- 
out sacrificing literalness.

Biography os In j" s studv of " The Empress Eu- 
the Empress ge"nie " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), M. 

Eugenie. Pierre de Lano appears to have 

taken his heroine's not very imposing mental and 
moral measure pretty correctly. M. de Lano is by 
no means friendly to the Empress, but he writes 
mostly without bitterness; and while finding Eu- 
ge"nie fickle, frivolous, cold, and of narrow aims 
and ambitions, he admits some good qualities, and 
acquits her of grosser accusations which her more 
venomous enemies have not scrupled to make. Eu- 
ge'nie's shortcomings, however, whatever they may 
have been, pale into trivialities beside the damn- 
ing charge that she instigated the war of 1870. 
History now admits that the Emperor opposed the 
war ; as to the degree of his wife's culpability in 
the matter, there seems to be some question. M. 
de Lano has no doubt whatever on this point; and 
his views may be gathered from the following story, 
which he quotes with approval and considers trust- 
worthy though it appears suspiciously melodra- 
matic. It seems that when the debate over the pro- 
posed declaration of war had reached^ts height, the 
Emperor refused to sign the fatal paper. As the 
ministers insisted, "he became angry, he the gen- 
tle, obstinate one, as his mother called him became 
violent, and seizing the decree, tore it in pieces, and 
scattered the fragments on the floor. . . . The Em- 
press, on hearing of the scene which had taken 
place, and of the determination of the Emperor, 
was much annoyed. She was most indignant. She 
now became angry, and having compelled the min- 
isters to restore the manuscript, she took possession 
of the new document, and went with it to the Em- 
peror, who signed it, as it were, in a dream." With- 
out putting too much faith in this anecdote, one may 
add that the seeming stability of the republic gives 
good hope that the long list of mischiefs wrought 
or furthered in France by the ignorant political 
meddlings of royal wives and royal mistresses ended 
with Sedan. The germ of M. de Lano's book is a 
series of articles published in 1890 in the " Figaro." 
These provoked at the time a bitter attack on the 
author in the "Gaulois"; and he now answers his 
critics, and presents a fuller exposition of his case. 
The Empress's life from the time of her marriage 
to the death of the Prince Imperial is freely dealt 
with ; and while M. de Lano is certainly more than 
a bit of a gossip, he appears to have tried to get at 
the truth. 



France and 
the European 
revolution. 



" The Revolutionary and Napoleonic 
Era" (Macmillan) is the initial vol- 
ume of a promising historical series, 
the " Cambridge," which aims to sketch the history 
of modern Europe and its colonies from the close of 
the fifteenth century down to the present time. The 
editor is Dr. G. W. Prothero, Prefessor of History 
in Edinburgh University ; and the author of the 
opening volume is Mr. J. H. Rose, University Ex- 
tension Lecturer in Modern History, late scholar of 
Christ's College, Cambridge. To the French Revo- 



lution proper, its intricate party strifes and dra- 
matic episodes, Mr. Rose has given relatively little 
space (95 out of the 370 pages), his chief aim be- 
ing to make clear the relation of that movement to 
the general European revolution, of which it was an 
earlier and acuter manifestation, and its consequent 
bearing upon existing political boundaries and con- 
ditions. The military dictatorship of Bonaparte, 
born of domestic anarchy and foreign warj curbed 
the revolution in France while extending it over the 
Continent. " The conflict with monarchical Eu- 
rope," says Mr. Rose, "is therefore the central fact 
of the revolution, determining not only the trend of 
events in France, but also the extension of French 
influence over Europe, and the formation of the 
chief Continental States." While Mr. Rose is a 
good narrator, as his admirable account of Water- 
loo attests, his attention is mainly given to showing 
the political and economic bearing of his facts ; 
hence his book is one for the serious reader. The 
volume is well printed, and contains a half-dozen 
excellent maps. 

Too much chit-chat, and too much 
Historical gossip i mpor t a nce attached to trifles, is what 

of modern England. r 

must be generally predicated ot Mrs. 
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer's otherwise respect- 
able compilation, " England in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury " (McClurg). The author says in the preface 
that she intended at first to call her book " His- 
torical Gossip "; and we see no good reason why the 
change of title was made. It is possible that Mrs. 
Latimer has injected the over-liberal element of 
small-talk into her work as a concession to the " gen- 
eral reader "; and if so, we think she has in many 
cases largely overrated the supposed mental infirm- 
ity and taste for twaddle of that abused individual. 
We can, for instance, fancy no reader " general " 
enough to like his history diluted with such infor- 
mation as this : " After the breakfast was over, 
bride and bridegroom changed their dresses the 
Prince for a dark travelling suit, the Queen for a 
white satin pelisse, trimmed with swan's-down, with 
a white satin bonnet and feather," etc. We would 
not imply, however, that Mrs. Latimer's book is 
barren of instruction, for parts of it are good enough 
to make us wonder the more at the frequency of 
passages like the one quoted; and in styling it a 
compilation it is fair to add that the text is not with- 
out occasional signs of an underlying logical process. 
That the author is not strong in economics is amus- 
ingly indicated by her naive ascription of the forced 
separation of husband and wife in the Union work- 
houses, not to Mr. Malthus and common sense gen- 
erally, but to a wish on the part of the hard-hearted 
framers of the Poor Law of 1834 " to inspire an 
intense horror of the workhouse." England was 
pretty nearly ruined by unwisely relaxing the strin- 
gency of the Elizabethan Poor Law ; and what the 
effect would have been of going further in the same 
direction, and maintaining at the public cost in every 
half-dozen or so parishes a huge establishment for

the breeding and rearing of hereditary paupers, Mrs. 
Latimer does not stop to consider. Beginning with 
the year 1822, the author rapidly sketches the lead- 
ing events and personages of the reigns of the last 
two Georges, William IV. and Victoria the last 
reign taking up three-fourths of the book. There 
is a fairly full account of the Reform movement, the 
East Indian administrations and mutiny, and the 
governments of Disraeli and Gladstone. The vol- 
ume is well printed, and contains twenty-seven nota- 
bly good portraits after photographs. 



New handbooks 
of English 
literature. 



A_new series of " Handbooks of En- 
glish Literature," edited by Professor 
j w Hales, is announced, and the 
first volume, " The Age of Pope," by Mr. John 
Dennis, already published (Macmillan). It is pro- 
posed in this series " to deal with the chief epochs 
of English literature in separate volumes of mod- 
erate length, but in such a manner that, taken to- 
gether, they will ultimately form a consecutive his- 
tory." The plan of the series is to adopt for each 
volume some one great writer, such as Chaucer, 
Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, or Wordsworth, " as 
the representative man of his period and the expo- 
nent of its leading tendencies and movements." Pro- 
fessor Hales himself will undertake some of the vol- 
umes, and others are promised by such scholars as 
Dr. Richard Garnett and Professor C. H. Herford. 
This is a promising programme, and we must add 
that Mr. Dennis has dealt with " The Age of Pope " 
in so scholarly and at the same time so interesting 
a way that much is to be hoped of the series thus 
auspiciously inaugurated. The period covered is 
the first half of the eighteenth century. Some idea 
of the spirit in which Mr. Dennis has done his 
work may be got from the following sentences: 
" The first object of a guide is to give accurate in- 
formation ; his second and larger object is to direct 
the reader's steps through a country exhaustless in 
variety and interest." "There is perhaps no dan- 
ger more carefully to be shunned by the student of 
literature than the habit of resting satisfied with 
opinions at second-hand. Better a wrong estimate 
formed after due reading and thought, than a right 
estimate gleaned from critics, without any thought 
at all." 



Introduction 
to English 
literature. 



" This work is an attempt to solve 
the problem of teaching English lit- 
erature." Such are the opening 
words of Professor F. V. N. Painter's preface to 
his "Introduction to English Literature" (Leach). 
Well, we can hardly admit that the problem has 
been solved, although the author has taken a step 
in the right direction. Briefly, he has divided the 
history into seven periods, and for each period has 
written a general characterization, followed by a 
careful study of from one to four authors, and an- 
notated examples of their work. Entire works are 
selected in most cases, although extracts are now 
and then resorted to. The merit of Professor 



Painter's book is that it spares the student the weari- 
some burden of detail forced upon him by most of 
the compilers of such books. Only writers of great 
importance are mentioned at all, and only fifteen 
authors altogether are taken up for careful study. 
But we do not believe that the problem will ever be 
solved by putting history and texts into a single 
volume. What is needed is a history in one rather 
small volume, and a great many annotated texts in 
a very big volume the latter being a book to delve 
in rather than a book to be studied from beginning 
to end. As an alternative for the single big vol- 
ume, we suggest a series of smaller ones, containing 
different sets of texts, the teacher being free to 
choose the volume or volumes that he can best use, 
and to vary the selection from year to year. The 
simple fact is that no student can hope to get any 
satisfaction out of the study of English literature 
unless he is prepared to spend a few dollars upon 
books. 

The volume on Abraham Lincoln by 
fe Mr ' Noah Brooks (Putnam), which 

has been added to the " Heroes of the 
Nations " series, is a new edition of a book first 
published six years ago. The author was in inti- 
mate relations with Mr. Lincoln after 1856, and 
wrote with full knowledge of the man and the times. 
His avowed purpose was to impress the image of 
his hero upon the " heart of that ' common people ' 
whom he loved so well, and of which he was the 
noblest representative." The book is not at all 
critical in its treatment of Lincoln's life. All un- 
pleasant features and events are glossed over after 
the manner of the hero-worshipper. Though it can- 
not compare with other volumes in the series such 
as Hodgkin's Theodoric and Strachan-Davidson's 
Cicero in weight and strength, it will do good as 
a popular life of one whom the people cannot know 
too well or honor too highly. 



Commemorative Five " Commemorative Addresses " 
addresses by by Mr. Parke Godwin are issued in 

Mr. Godwin. attractive shape by Messrs. Harper 

& Brothers. The papers, one and all, are much 
more comprehensive and readable than the collect- 
ive title leads one to expect an occasional address 
being in general a pretty trite and perfunctory per- 
formance. Mr. Godwin's subjects are : George 
William Curtis, Edwin Booth, Louis Kossuth, John 
James Audubon, and William Cullen Bryant. No- 
tably good is the paper on Mr. Curtis really one 
of the best biographical sketches of the Montaigne 
of the "Easy Chair" that we remember to have 
seen. Necessarily a shade declamatory and eulo- 
gistic in tone, the addresses are nevertheless quieter 
and more critical than most compositions of their 
kind ; and their graphic and anecdotal quality makes 
them pleasant reading. Apropos of Mr. Curtis's 
" Brook Farm" experiences, briefly narrated by our 
author, it is instructive to learn that he was chiefly 
remembered by his associates in that venture " for

his sprightly leadership of picnics and masquerades, 
and his pleasant singing, after nightfall, of roman- 
zas from the operas." One can hardly fancy the 
genial humorist playing a very serious part in Mr. 
Ripley's idyl or, indeed, taking the idyl itself very 
seriously. 

Miss Anne Hollingsworth Wharton's 
More pictures Colonial Days and Dames" (Lip- 

of Colonial life. . * 

pmcott) torms an acceptable supple- 
ment to her bright little book, "Through Colonial 
Doorways," reviewed at length in THE DIAL for 
May, 1893. The volume presents a chatty picture 
of Colonial home and social life, liberally sprin- 
kled with extracts from letters, journals, etc., of 
the period. It is pretty plain that Miss Wharton 
has written with a certain sense of personal in- 
terest in her theme; and our budding American 
noblesse who "trace back" genealogically to Colo- 
nial and Revolutionary days should find her pages 
by no means "thin sown with profit and delight." 
Outwardly the volume is, like all of Messrs. Lippin- 
cott's recent publications, notably tasteful and at- 
tractive. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A batch of modern language publications from the 
press of Mr. W. R. Jenkins includes several useful text- 
books. "Les Historiens Franc.ais du XIXe Siecle," by 
M. C. Fontaine, is a series of selections from the best 
historical writers, forming a fairly connected history of 
France from the age of Louis XIV. to our own times. 
Notes, few but sufficient, are given at the bottom of the 
page. Smaller books are " L' Art d'Inte*resser en Classe," 
including stories, fables, and Labiche's " La Lettre 
Chargde," edited by M. Victor F. Bernard; "La Tra- 
duction Orale," also by M. Bernard ; " La Conversation 
des Enfants," by M. Charles Du Croquet; and "Pre- 
liminary French Drill," by " Veteran." A new French 
text is M. Daudet's " Le Petit Chose," in the " Romans 
Choisis," edited by M. Fontaine. Two stories by Sig. 
de Amicis, " Fortezzo " and " Un Gran Giorno," edited 
by Mr. T. E. Comba, make a pamphlet number of the 
series of " Novelle Italiane." Last of all, there are two 
Spanish texts : " El Final de Norma," by Seiior Alarcdn, 
opening a series of " Novelas Escogidas," and " El Pa- 
jaro Verde," by Senor Valera, opening a series of 
" Cuentos Selectos." The former is edited by Mr. de 
La Cortina, and the latter by Mr. Julio Rojas. 

The multiplication of French texts for school use goes 
merrily on. From Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we now 
have editions of " Hernani " and " Ruy Bias," the for- 
mer edited by Dr. George M. Harper, the latter by 
Dr. Samuel Garner. A portrait of Hugo prefaces the 
one, a map of Madrid the other. Introductions and 
notes are excellent in both. The same publishers send 
us M. HaleVy's " L'Abbe" Constantin," edited by Dr. 
Thomas Logie; and M. Pailleron's " Le Monde ou 1'On 
S'Ennuie," edited by Mr. A. C. Pendleton. From Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. we have two useful texts "A Scientific 
French Reader," edited by Mr. Alexander W. Herdler; 
and " Difficult Modern French," edited by M. Albert 
Leune. The former includes short articles with illus- 
trative woodcuts, the latter selections from such men as 



" Stendhal," Gautier, Leconte de Lisle, Flaubert, and 
many of the moderns. The selections are in both prose 
and poetry. Finally, the Christopher Sower Co. pub- 
lish "Jean Mornas " and " Tuyet," two stories by M. 
Jules Claretie, edited in a single volume by Mr. Edward 
H. Magill. 

In the new and revised edition ( Macmillan ) of Dr. 
Oskar Seyffert's " Dictionary of Classical Antiquities " 
English readers are offered what is probably the most 
useful single-volume work upon the subject to be had. 
The present edition, which is the third, has been edited 
by Dr. J. E. Sandys, and brought sufficiently to date to 
include the latest discoveries and theories. The articles 
Comitia, Music, and Theatre, are examples of this incor- 
poration of new matter. There are over seven hundred 
two-columned pages of clear type, nearly five hundred 
illustrations, and full indexes. 

Mr. G. Steel's " An English Grammar and Analysis " 
( Longmans ) hardly satisfies the author's claim of being 
an "improvement in the methods usually followed" in 
language study. In fact, several works could readily 
be called to mind that are distinctly superior to it for 
class-room work. The main fault of the book is the at- 
tempt to bring grammar, etymology, rhetoric and com- 
position within the limits of 300 pages. 

Mr. Thomas Atkinson Jenkins, a candidate for the 
doctorate at the Johns Hopkins University, has just 
published his dissertation, which has for its subject 
" L'Espurgatoire Seint Patriz " of Marie de France. This 
important twelth-century poem is presented in a critical 
text, with a careful study of the language, and intro- 
ductory chapters upon the author, her work, and the 
dialect in which she wrote. Concerning the latter sub- 
ject Mr. Jenkins concludes that her dialect was Franco- 
Norman, thus controverting the opinion of Professor 
Suchier, who declares for a specifically French dialect. 
Mr. Jenkins has produced a solid and valuable piece of 
philological work. 

Three new volumes in " The Student's Series of En- 
glish Classics " (Leach) include Goldsmith's " Traveller" 
and " Deserted Village," edited by Mr. Warren F. 
Gregory; Tennyson's "Elaine," edited by Miss Fannie 
M. McCauley; and " The Merchant of Venice," edited 
by Professor Katharine Lee Bates. The latter volume, 
in particular, is an admirable piece of editorial work, 
having notes that deal largely with parallel passages 
from other poets a sort of help too often neglected by 
commentators. We may also give mention in this 
paragraph to Mr. George P. Baker's edition of Lyly's 
"Endymion" (Holt), which has few notes, but, on the 
other hand, an elaborate biographical and critical intro- 
duction, which shows workmanship of a high order. 

Once in a year or so the University of Nebraska 
issues a pamphlet volume of " University Studies." 
The latest of these issues, dated July, 1894, is at hand, 
and contains three papers of solid value. Mr. E. H. 
Barbour has some " Additional Notes on the New Fos- 
sil, Daimonelit," twelve plates richly illustrating the 
paper. " The Decrease of Predication and of Sentence 
Weight in English Prose " is the subject of a study by 
Mr. G. W. Gerwig. It represents much careful work 
done in continuation of Professor Sherman's chapters 
upon the subject in his " Analytics of Literature." The 
third paper is by Mr. Fred M. Fling, and considers 
Mirabeau as an opponent of absolutism, a subject in- 
teresting in connection with Professor von Hoist's re- 
cent lectures on the great French statesman.

[Feb. 16, 



YORK ^TOPICS. 

New York, February 11, 1895. 

The " Trilby " living pictures foreshadowed in a 
previous letter have materialized in an elaborate char- 
ity entertainment given last Saturday in the ball-room 
of a fashionable caterer's in this city. " Scenes and 
Songs from Trilby " consisted of tableaux of the princi- 
pal illustrations in the volume, with renderings of the 
songs mentioned therein. The proceeds are to go to the 
New York Kindergarten Association, in which Mrs. 
Wiggin and Mr. Gilder are deeply interested. A copy 
of "Trilby," with autograph inscriptions by Mr. du 
Maurier and Henry James, and a manuscript copy of 
Dr. English's song, " Ben Bolt," was auctioned off by 
Mrs. Wiggin during the intermission for a hundred dol- 
lars, a surprisingly small price considering the packed 
house and the Trilby-mania now rampant. The list of 
lady patronesses included the wives of several literary 
men, as well as a number of society women, some of 
them belonging in a sense to both classes. In fact, 
books are a fad in the outskirts of " society " at present, 
and I have even seen within a week a letter from one 
of the late Mr. McAllister's " Four Hundred " requesting 
the autograph of a well-known New York novelist. 
The chilling thought occurs, however, that she may have 
wanted it for a church fair, and that her interest was 
merely fictitious. After all, this would be quite proper 
in the case of a writer of fiction. " Trilby " enthusiasm 
has reached the art circles also, and various idealized 
portraits of the " dear Trilby " have been painted. The 
best piece of work of this sort which I have seen was 
in the studio of Mr. C. Y. Turner, who has made a 
lovely ideal painting of " Sweet Alice," immortalized in 
" Ben Bolt." The dress of the damsel is copied from 
his mother's wedding-gown, of even date with " Trilby " 
and " Sweet Alice." "And so no more of " Trilby. 

Far removed from this hysteric, hypnotic patroniza- 
tion of literature and art was the lecture given, on the 
morning of the same day, by Mr. William Crary Brown- 
ell, on the life and genius of Auguste Rodin. It was 
delivered at the Metropolitan Museum, in the course 
given under the auspices of Columbia College, having 
already been repeated privately before the Sculpture 
Society. An intelligent and interested audience listened 
to Mr. Brownell's keen characterizations and brilliant 
epigrams. He made very plain the distinction between 
Rodin's art and the academic art of the Institute sculp- 
tors, and illustrated his points with some fifty stereop- 
ticon views of Rodin's work, including details of the 
Dante portal for the new Museum of Decorative Arts 
at Paris, studies of which were shown in a private room 
at the Columbian Exposition, " St. John the Baptist," 
"The Kiss," "The Calais Bourgeois," "A Danaide," 
and portrait statues and busts of Bastien-Lepage, Hugo, 
Laurens, Henly, Legros, and Mme. Morla. Mr. Brownell 
will be succeeded in these Columbia College lectures 
by Mr. T. Humphry Ward, who will give a course on 
" The History of English Art, with especial reference 
to Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Romney." The first 
lecture, on February 16, treats of art in England under 
the first two Georges. The remaining three are devoted 
separately to the above-mentioned artists. Mr. Ward 
arrived from England last Saturday, after a most tem- 
pestuous voyage. 

It is never safe to " holler " until you are out of the 
woods. It seems that Mr. Robert Underwood John- 
son and the Copyright League, on examining the Cov- 



ert bill for the limitation of newspaper liability, found 
a very large snake in the grass in the shape of possible 
nominal damages for infringement of copyright. In 
spite of Mr. Johnson's efforts, seconded by Mr. Covert, 
to have definite sums ($250 to $5000) named, the bill 
passed the Committee on Patents in its objectionable 
form ; and the fight must be carried on in Congress itself. 
Another correction concerns my reference to Mr. Pick- 
ard and " The Life and Letters of Whittier," the con- 
densation of which seemed to make me reflect on his 
editing of that work. This was quite apart from fey 
intention. In regard to copyright, an important though 
not final decision has been rendered in the famous Rider 
Haggard case, which Mr. Daniel G. Thompson has been 
conducting for Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The 
chief point at issue was not the constitutionality of the 
International Copyright Law, but the claim that books 
published in the United States are not protected by 
copyright unless the American notice is printed in all 
foreign editions as well. This claim has been set aside 
in favor of Mr. Rider Haggard and his publishers, al- 
though leave is given the defendant firm to plead again 
in answer. 

" The Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc," to ap- 
pear serially in " Harper's Monthly," will show Joan, it is 
announced, as a daughter of the people; the scenes and 
incidents of her girlhood among her rustic playmates; 
her childish superstitions ; her distressful solicitudes for 
her country; the heavenly voices and visions that nour- 
ished the hope of deliverance that should surely come 
through her; her conquest of a corrupt court; her mar- 
tial triumphs, and her betrayal and martyrdom. The 
author's name is not disclosed, although he is described 
as one of the most successful among American writers 
of fiction. He is disguised as " the Sieur Louis de 
Conte," Joan's " Page and Secretary." This nom de 
plume almost makes me think that Mr. Janvier is the 
hidden author; but on the whole I stick to "Mark 
Twain " for the present. I trust this work will turn out 
to be an American rival of " Trilby " et al. At the same 
time it should be borne in mind that Mr. Crawford's 
books are reaching large editions, and Mr. Crawford 
is an American, I believe. 

The appointment of Mr. Herbert Putnam, brother of 
the publishers, as librarian of the Boston Public Library, 
meets with solid approval here and in that city. Inci- 
dentally, it leads the Boston " Transcript " to another 
needless outburst of parochialism to the effect that Mr. 
Putnam's being " a New Yorker by birth shall not be 
treasured up against him in Boston, since he has lived 
there but little since his Harvard days and his gradua- 
tion in the class of 1883." Mr. Putnam is a classmate 
of Professor Edward E. Hale, Jr., and of Assistant Sec- 
retary Charles Sumner Hamlin. He organized the new 
Public Library of Minneapolis, and President Eliot has 
said that in doing this he proved himself one of the three 
best librarians in the United States. Mr. Putnam has 
been practicing law in Boston for some three years, but 
had decided to leave that city for New York, so the 
Boston " Herald " says, when the appointment came. 
The traditions of his family and his own personal abil- 
ity promise large results. As for the Public Library, 
the long hiatus in its management has turned out for 
its benefit. May Mr. John Bigelow's inaction as to the 
Tilden trust prove equally beneficial, is the prayer of 
many here; for New York has no public library. 

Two new books of importance, to be published shortly 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, as yet unannounced,

THE DIAL

are " The Mogul Emperors of Hindustan," by Dr. Ed- 
ward S. Holden, and " Letters of a Baritone," by Fran- 
cis Walker. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons announce 
" The Arthurian Epic," a comparative study of the 
Cambrian, Breton, and Anglo-Norman versions of the 
story, and Tennyson's " Idylls of the King," by S. Hum- 
phreys Gurteen. Mr. Gurteen is a graduate of Cam- 
bridge University, and has become popularly known as 
the originator of charity organization in England. This 
excursion into the field of comparative criticism deals 
with the rise, growth, and later developments of the 
legends relating to King Arthur, from the first mention 
of his name in Welsh song to the epic cyclus perfected 
under the clever romancers of the twelfth century, and 
compares the original tales with Tennyson's versions. 
Many interesting facts in regard to Tennyson's varia- 
tions from the legends are given, as yet generally un- 
known. Mr. Gurteen has gone back to the original 
sources in each case. He is now occupied with a com- 
panion volume to the above, to be entitled " The Epic 
of the Fall of Man." This work will be a comparative 
study of the epics of Cffidmon, Dante, and Milton, with 
critical comparisons of their masterpieces. There is 
room for only a mere mention of the success of Verdi's 
" Falstaff " at the Metropolitan Opera House last week. 
The sale of the Foote collection of books proved suc- 
cessful beyond the expectations of the owner, and was 
an event in the world of letters. Next Thursday the 
Authors Club will hold its first meeting in the rooms 
devoted to it in the new Carnegie annex, first described 
in this correspondence. A notable love-feast is expected. 

ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



IiITEKARY NOTES. 



Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce a translation of 
the great " Lehrbuch der Botanik," the joint work of 
Drs. Strasburger, Noll, Schenck, and Schimper. 

Mr. W. J. Courthope has long been engaged upon a 
" History of English Poetry," and the first of the four 
volumes projected is now ready for publication. 

" The Publisher's Weekly " records 4484 books issued 
in this country during 1894, a decrease of 650 from the 
total for 1893. The falling-off was mainly in fiction 
and theology. Many departments, on the other hand, 
exhibit a slight increase. 

A uniform library edition of the more popular prose 
works of Robert Louis Stevenson will soon be issued by 
Messrs. Scribner's Sons. The set will number sixteen 
volumes, comprising romances, short stories, and essays, 
and will be published at a reasonable price to meet a 
popular demand. 

New York has had its Grolier Club for several years, 
and now Chicago has its similar organization the Cax- 
ton Club, of which Mr. J. W. Ellsworth is president. 
The Club will soon begin a series of publications, and 
is meanwhile engaged in superintending an exhibition 
of bookbindings to be held at an early date at the Art 
Institute. 

Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, of Portland, Maine, has 
just issued the first number of a monthly magazine 
called " The Bibelot," and containing selections from 
the prose and poetical works of authors whose produc- 
tions are hard to get or out of print. The first number 
is devoted to William Blake. Another will include 
translations of the poems of Villon. 



The School of Applied Ethics, which has already held 
three summer sessions at Plymouth, has added the win- 
ter session to its programme, and began its meetings at 
Washington, D. C., on the thirteenth of this month. 
This winter session will continue for seven weeks, with 
two or three lectures a week. Professors Felix Adler, 
Woodrow Wilson, and Henry C. Adams are the prin- 
cipal lecturers. Three educational conferences, March 
19, 20, and 21, are included in the programme. 

Mr. Karl Karoly, whose beautiful " Raphael's Ma- 
donnas and Other Great Pictures " was one of the most 
successful of recent holiday gift-books, has in press a. 
full account of all " The Paintings of Venice," which 
will be published in a few weeks by Messrs. Bell & 
Sons, London, and Macmillan & Co., New York. The 
book will be handsomely illustrated with photographic 
reproductions of some of the celebrated Venetian pic- 
tures, and will be out before the Art Exposition begins 
in Venice in April. 

The following notes taken from the editorial depart- 
ment of the February " Educational Review " are a 
sound in doctrine as their praise is well-deserved: " The 
last annual report of Superintendent Lane of Chicago 
contains conclusive evidence that, notwithstanding the 
ravings and revilings of certain newspapers specially 
prepared, as Mr. Charles A. Dana would say, to be read 
by fools, the public schools of that city are making sub- 
stantial progress. More than any other city superin- 
tendent in the country, Superintendent Lane has been 
called upon to resist the civium prava jubentium ardor. 
He has stood nobly for the right. He deserves the thanks 
of progressive teachers throughout the land." 

Sir John Robert Seeley, K. C. M. G., author of Ecce 
Homo," The Life and Times of Stein," The Expan- 
sion of England," and small books upon Napoleon and 
Goethe, died at Cambridge on the thirteenth of Jan- 
uary. A historian of the scientific school, his work was- 
without the qualities that attract a large audience (al- 
ways excepting the "Ecce Homo"), but those that 
found their way to it got from it such instruction and 
discipline as has been afforded by few of the historical 
writers of our time. We learn from the " Cambridge 
Review " that Professor Seeley's great work on the for- 
eign policy of England in the seventeenth century was 
nearly completed before the long illness that preceded 
his death. 

The Grolier Club of New New, the parent biblio- 
maniac club of the country, has been giving an inter- 
esting exhibition of historic book-bindings at its club 
building in that city. The books displayed are from 
the libraries of famous collectors, and from the collec- 
tions of various kings of France and England and their 
consorts, and are loaned by members of the club. The 
libraries of Mr. Samuel P. Avery and Mr. Robert Hoe 
have been especially drawn upon. It was something of 
a surprise, our correspondent writes us, to see fifteen or 
twenty handsome volumes from Grolier's library, with 
their distinctive bindings and motto. Books from the 
collections of de Thon, Mazarin, and a host of similar 
amateurs of book-binding, are shown; but the interest 
centres in an extensive exhibit of volumes emblazoned 
with the arms and insignia of certain fair ladies and 
their royal lovers. Diana of Poitiers and Henry II., the 
Marquise de Maintenon and Louis XIV., the Comtesse 
du Barry and Louis XV., are so represented; as well as 
Henry IV. and Margaret of Valois, and Charles I. of 
England and Henrietta Maria. A rare quarto from the

library of Henry III. of France bears an inlaid full- 
length portrait of the king worked ont in different 
colored leathers. The exhibition could scarcely be du- 
plicated in this country outside of four or five of the 
New York collectors' libraries. 

Charles Etienne Arthur Gayarre', the Historian of 
Louisiana, died at his home in New Orleans, early in 
the morning of February 11. On the 9th of January 
he celebrated his ninety-first birthday. He was a na- 
tive of New Orleans, and descended from persons em- 
inent in the French colonial history of Louisiana. After 
graduating at the College of Orleans, he studied law in 
Philadelphia, and was there admitted to practice in 
1829. Returning to Louisiana the following year he en- 
tered upon a political career, and was successively State 
Senator, Attorney General, and Presiding Judge of the 
City Court of New Orleans. In 1835 he was elected to 
the U. S. Senate, but ill health prevented his entering 
upon the duties of this office. He went abroad and spent 
eight years in Paris and Madrid. Upon his return he 
was again elected to the State Legislature, and in 1846 
was appointed Secretary of State of Louisiana. This 
office he held for seven years. He was defeated for 
Congress in 1853, and unsuccessful in his attempts to se- 
cure the nomination in 1868. For several years he was 
Reporter for the Supreme Court of his native state. 
Judge Gayarre"s literary life began during his college 
days and continued until within the last decade. His 
more serious work began with the publication of " His- 
toire de la Louisiane," two volumes, in 1847. Historical 
works followed in quick succession, viz., " Romance of the 
History of Louisiana," 1848 ; " Louisiana, Its Colonial 
History and Romance," 1851; "Louisiana, its History 
as a French Colony," two vols., 1851-2 ; " History of the 
Spanish Domination in Louisiana from 1769 to Decem- 
ber 1803," 1854; "History of Louisiana " completed, 
revised, and brought down to 1861, three vols., 1866; 
" Philip II. of Spain," 1866. Some of these comprised 
courses of lectures delivered about 1847-48. He was 
the author of two works of fiction, " Fernando de Le- 
mos " (1872) and its sequel, " Aubert Dubayet" (1882), 
and of two comedies, "The School for Politics "and 
" Dr. Bluff," besides numerous pamphlets, addresses, 
lectures, and magazine articles. The author retained 
his mental vigor to the last. His later years have been 
spent in a modest cottage in the eastern portion of New 
Orleans, not precisely in the old " French Quarter," but 
east of Esplanade street, and in a neighborhood where 
the French element dominates. Of late years it has 
been the custom among his friends to celebrate his birth- 
day in a more or less public manner. Judge Gayarre* 
married many years ago, but was childless. His wife 
survives him.

The author's point of view in dealing with this interesting and im-

seeking not to take sides for or against "Combines," still less to pass 
judgment on them from a moral standpoint.

A Timely and Practical Book on the Currency. 
Honest Money. 

By ARTHUR I. FONDA. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

"A thoughtful discussion of the financial problem, based on a plea 
for the complete divorcement of out money system from the systems of 
other countries, and an argument in particular against the gold stand- 
ard." Evening Bulletin (Philadelphia). 

" Mr. Fonda's system has the merit of simplicity. He would have 
Congress appoint a commission to fix a standard of value in accordance 
with the purchasing power of say 100 of the commodities most largely 
bought and sold. A dollar would then mean so much wheat, so much 
corn, so many pounds of pig iron or cotton. Having thus fixed the unit 
of value, the Government would issue notes redeemable in any com- 
modity at its current market price using the national banks as a dis- 
tributing agency." Boston Advertiser.

THE GREAT ICE AGE, 

AND ITS RELATION TO THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN. By JAMES 
GEIKIE, LL.D., F.R.S.,etc., Prof essor of Geology and Min- 
eralogy in the University of Edinburgh. Third edition, 
largely rewritten. With Maps and Illustrations. 8vo, 
cloth, $7.50.| 

f In this new edition the author has profited by the sources of infor- 
mation opened since the first appearance of his book. Nearly three- 
fourths of the volume have been entirely rewritten, and the remainder 
revised and rearranged. He has visited the regions described and veri- 
fied the reports of others, and he makes a special acknowledgement to 
recent American students of the Ice Age. The new edition offers a 
comprehensive survey of this fascinating subject brought down to date. 

THE PYGMIES. 

By A. DE QUATREFAOES, late Professor of Anthropology at 
the Museum of Natural History, Paris. Translated by Pro- 
fessor Frederick Starr. With numerous Illustrations. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.75. 

This is the second volume in the Anthropological Series. The author 
has gathered the results of careful studies of the small black races of 
Africa, and he shows what the pygmies of antiquity really were. The 
peculiar intellectual, moral, and religious characteristics of these races 
are also described. 

THE LAND OF THE SUN. 

Vistas Mexicanas. By CHRISTIAN REID, author of "The 
Land of the Sky," " A Comedy of Elopement," etc. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. | 

In this picturesque travel romance the author of " The Laud of the 
Sky " takes her characters from New Orleans to fascinating Mexican 
cities like Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Aguas Calientes, Guadalajara, and 
of course the City of Mexico. What they see and what they do are 
described in a vivacious style which renders the book most valuable to 
those who wish an interesting Mexican travel-book unencumbered with 
details, while the story as a story sustains the high reputation of this 
talented author. 

VERNON'S AUNT.

"A Social Departure," "An American Girl in London," 
"The Simple Adventures of a Memsahib," and "A Daugh-

After her strong and absorbing novel " A Daughter of To-day," Mrs. 
Cotes again demonstrates her elasticity by a return to the vivacious 
humor which gained her first laurels. " Vernon's Aunt " is a delicious 
story of contrasting types and absurd misadventures. The sparkling 
descriptions of the author are accompanied by most felicitous illustra- 
tions.

The fourth volume opens with the repeal of the 
British Orders in Council and the close of the arm- 
istice concluded just before the surrender of Hull, 
and takes up the story of the second war for inde- 
pendence. The chapter called "The Return of 
Peace " ends the story of the war, and gives with 
great fulness an account of the treaty-making at 
Ghent. At this point a new era opens in our history. 
The war is over, the foreign complications which 
distracted the country since 1793 no longer trouble 
it, and the people begin to turn their attention to 
domestic affairs. The remainder of the volume 
therefore treats of our economic history. " The 
Disorders of the Currency " is a chapter in our 
annals which has never before been told. The chap- 
ters on " Political Reforms," the " Missouri Com- 
promise," " Eighteen Hundred and Starve to Death," 
which treats of the hard times of 1819 and 1820, 
complete the volume, which is illustrated with many 
diagrams, and maps in outline and in color.

POE THY AS CRITICISM OF 
LITERATURE. 

We have heard much (something too much, 
indeed) of poetry as a criticism of life, since 
the time when Matthew Arnold, in his essay on 
Wordsworth, started that famous phrase on its 
career. Its inadequacy has been pointed out 
by many critics since, and it is now, we should 
say, definitely relegated to the limbo of half- 
truths that fascinate for a time by virtue of 
their novelty, but that speedily become discred- 
ited. Probably the most convincing of the 
many protests it evoked was that of the writer 
who urged that, so far from being a mere criti- 
cism upon life, the greatest poetry is life itself, 
in direct transcription. But, while we must 
regard as whimsical the notion that poetry is 
nothing more than criticism, even glorified 
criticism, we may freely admit that there is to 
be found in poetical literature a large element 
critical of life and of many other things as 
well. Among those other things, literature 
itself is of considerable importance ; and we 
here wish to say a few words about the treas- 
ures of literary criticism that are among the 
precious gifts brought us by the poet. 

In this age of the multiplication of antholo- 
gies, it has for many years been to us a matter 
of surprise that some one did not prepare a 
volume of " Poems of Poets," to go with the 
" Poems of Places," the " Poems of Books," 
the " Poems of Nature," and the many other 
special collections. Within the last year or so, 
the want has been supplied, after a fashion, by 
two independent collections ; and the lover of 
poets, as well as the owner of dogs and the 
smoker of tobacco, is now provided with his 
own anthology of favorite pieces. There is 
still room for a better collection than has yet 
been made, but the needs of a deserving class 
of readers have at least received recognition. 

It has often been urged that the critic of any 
art should be at the same time an adept in the 
practice thereof. This view doubtless rests 
upon a misconception, being analogous to the 
view that no one can intelligently read a for- 
eign language without speaking it as well. 
In the case of the language, as is sufficiently 
obvious, the process by which one acquires its 



134 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



use for reading is essentially unlike the pro- 
cess by which one learns to speak it. To speak 
psychologically, the nexus of associative tracks 
worn by much reading of French or Latin is 
one thing, and the nexus worn by much speak- 
ing of a foreign tongue quite another. To be 
more exact, we should perhaps say that the as- 
sociative stimulus, while going over the same 
nerve-track in any particular case, takes one 
direction in the case of reading, and the re- 
verse direction in the case of speech. Because 
the passage from word -symbol to concept is 
easily made, it by no means follows that the pas- 
sage from concept to word-symbol will present 
no difficulty. A similar situation, although 
a far more complicated one, is presented when 
we compare the practice of literary composi- 
tion with its criticism. But it is nevertheless 
true that the reader of a foreign tongue is better 
prepared to get its full significance if his asso- 
ciations have been trained to work freely in both 
directions ; and it is likewise true that the critic 
of literature who has made literature himself 
is, ipso facto, in some respects better equipped 
to understand just what has been accomplished 
by his fellow workers. Only we must not go 
so far as to say that creative power brings with 
it the critical faculty ; the former may indeed 
add something to the effectiveness of the lat- 
ter, but the intuitional character of the one is 
still permanently differentiated from the re- 
flective character of the other. 

That the poets are capable of writing good 
prose criticism of their art, it needs no argu- 
ment to show. We think at once of Lessing 
and Goethe, of Voltaire and Hugo, of Shelley 
and Coleridge, and of fifty others. We are now 
concerned to call attention to the fact that 
some of the most acute and sympathetic criti- 
cism of the poets that we have is to be found 
in poetry itself. Since English literature best 
illustrates this fact, although other literatures 
might profitably be adduced in further support 
of it, we shall be content with English ex- 
amples alone. The good work of poetical criti- 
cism was begun by Chaucer, who labored un- 
der the disadvantage of having no fellow-poets 
of his own speech to sing about, and who was 
thus compelled to find subjects for his "House 
of Fame " and other critical ventures in the 
great names of classical antiquity or of con- 
temporary Italy. From Chaucer's time to the 
present, the work has gone merrily on, and the 
last of our great poets has written more good 
poetry about his fellow-singers than we owe to 
any of his predecessors. 



The contemporaries and immediate followers 
of Chaucer had at least one English poet to 
panegyrize ; and so Gower, and Occleve, and 
Lydgate, to the best of their mean powers, 
paid tribute to their master. Even to-day, do 
we not feel some thrill of sympathy when we 
read Occleve? 

" O maister dere and fader reverent, 
My maister Chaucer, flowre of eloquence, 
Mirrour of fructuous entendement 
O universal fader in science, 
Alias ! that thou thyne excellent prudence 
In thy bedde mortel myghtest not bequethe 
What eyled dethe, alias ! why wolde he sle thee ? " 

When we come down to the Elizabethans, we 
find the poets rioting in versified criticism of 
one another. Shakespeare is a notable excep- 
tion to this rule, and in the one case in which 
he displayed enthusiasm for a contemporary, 
and spoke of " the proud full sail of his great 
verse," he forgot to tell us whom he meant. 
There is a good deal of log-rolling, and no lit- 
tle malice, in all this personal poetry (such 
things have been known in later times, even in 
our own), but many of these tributes strike a 
note of sincerity, and display an insight, for 
which we must ever cherish them. How true, 
for example, is Drayton's familiar description of 
Marlowe : " His raptures were all air and fire"; 
and Barnfield's of Spenser : " Whose deep con- 
ceit is such, as passing all conceit, needs no 
defense "; and Jonson's of Shakespeare : " He 
was not for an age but for all time." 

It is curious to note, as we work down the 
centuries, how the taste of each age is reflected 
in these appreciations of poets by poets. In 
the seventeenth century, Milton and Dryden, 
indeed, as we might naturally expect of the 
two greatest men of their age, showed an un- 
derstanding of Shakespeare's supremacy that 
leaves nothing to be desired ; but the lesser 
men of the time clearly preferred the lesser 
Elizabethans, or the decadent artificers among 
their own contemporaries. The poets of our 
so-called Augustan age usually referred to the 
great English classics in a perfunctory sort of 
way, and gave them but a grudging recogni- 
tion. It is very amusing to find Addison, with 
all the airs of the Superior Person, saying of 
Chaucer that " In vain he jests in his unpol- 
ished strain," and of Spenser, that he " In an- 
cient tales amused a barbarous age," writing 
on the other hand of " Great Cowley then, a 
mighty genius," and going into rhapsodies over 
that " harmonious bard," the " courtly Wai 
ler." Equally amusing contrasted citations 
might be made from Pope. It was only in the 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



135 



later eighteenth century, with Collins and Gray, 
that poetry acquired a saner outlook upon 
itself, and began to grope back toward the old 
truth that art is better than artifice. 

The nineteenth century is so rich in the 
homage of poet to fellow-poet, that an essay, 
rather than a paragraph, would be needed to 
do it justice. Wordsworth's sonnet to Milton, 
Shelley's " Adonai's," Keats's " Chapman's 
Homer," Lander's sonnet " To Robert Brown- 
ing," Mrs. Browning's " Wine of Cyprus," 
Rossetti's "Dante at Verona," Arnold's "Thyr- 
sis," Tennyson's " Alcaics," and Mr. Swin- 
burne's sonnets on the Elizabethan drama- 
tists, are a few of the countless examples that 
will occur to every reader. And we would call 
particular attention to the fine critical quality of 
the mass of work which these poems so imper- 
fectly represent. Their writers have good rea- 
sons for the faith that is in them ; they do not 
merely eulogize, they illuminate as well. If 
this were not so, the present article would have 
no excuse for existence. We do not know 
where in prose to find better criticism than 
Wordsworth's of Milton : 

" Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea ; 
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free," 

or Landor's of Browning : 

" Since Chaucer was alive and hale 
No man has walk'd along our roads with step 
So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue 
So varied in discourse," 

or Arnold's of Goethe : 

" He took the suffering human race, 
He read each wound, each weakness clear ; 
And struck his finger on the place, 
And said : ' Thou ailest here, and here ! "' 

Or Mr. Swinburne's of Dante mourning over 
a country recreant to its mission and dead in 
spirit : 

" The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet, 
And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread 
Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed ; 
But nothing was there in the world so sweet 
As the most bitter love, like God's own grace, 
Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face." 

We hope that some one will undertake the 
preparation of an enchiridion of poetical crit- 
icism more comprehensive than has yet been 
attempted, a collection of the best things that 
have been said in the poetry of half a dozen 
modern literatures about the best poets of the 
whole world. Such a collection would be of 
the greatest value to the student of literary 
criticism, and would deserve to stand on the 
shelf beside the "Poetics" of Aristotle, the 
treatise of Longinus, the impassioned pleas of 
Sidney and Shelley, and the essays of Coleridge, 
Arnold, and Pater. 



THE PASSING OF CHIRSTINA ROSSETTI. 

It was little for her to die, 

For her to whom breath was prayer, 
For her who had long put by 

Earth-desire ; 

Who had knelt in the Holy Place 
And had drunk the incense-air, 
Till her soul to seek God's face 
Leapt like fire. 

It was only to slip her free 

Of the vestal raiment worn 
O'er the lengthening lily lea 

Toward the west, 
For a robe more lustrous white 

By the sunset spirits borne 
From mansions jewel-bright 
Of her rest. 

It was only to shift her clime, 

Clinging still to the harp of gold, 
Fairy-gift of her cradle-time, 

Angel-gift, 
Of a strain so thrilling rare 

We shall hunger on earthly wold 
And listen if down the air 
Echoes drift. 

It was little for her to pass 

From this storm-sea, sorrow-iced, 
To a summer sea of glass, 

Sea of sky, 
To change the dream and the spur 

For the truth, the goal, the Christ. 
Oh, but it was for her 
Much to die.

THE HUMANITIES AND COLLEGE EDUCATION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The plea for the humanities as essential to genuine 
culture, in the editorial article of your last issue, is 
greatly needed in these present days, when the philis- 
tinism of Herbert Spencer is too rapidly making its way 
in the faculties of not a few of our Western colleges. 
You put it too mildly, however, when you say that the 
humanities " may fairly demand as much attention and 
as large an expenditure as the sciences of nature." 
Should they not in the curricula of our secondary schools 
and colleges demand more ? The naturalists are not 
modest in their claims. Accepting, as many do, whether 
consciously or unconsciously, the view that man is 
merely the product of his material environment, they 
quite logically exalt the study of that environment above 
the study of man himself. Moreover, in so far as they 
study man it is rather as naturalists than as those who 
recognize and feel the deeper powers and significances 
of human life. But physics, chemistry, physiology, or 
even physiological psychology, cannot rightly and ade- 
quately teach us of man. As Paulsen, who claims that 
in the university the sciences of nature should have 
equal footing with the sciences of man, yet says, " Man 
lives in history, the brute in nature." Hence history, 
sociology, language, literature, psychology in its true 
sense, philosophy, and the great religious books of the 



136 



THE DIAL 



[March l r 



world, will best teach us of man, and best develop the 
finer elements of manhood. And it is to be devoutly 
hoped that our colleges will never wholly cease to recog- 
nize this. Some of them have yielded too much to the 
really arrogant claim that the natural sciences give a 
culture equal if not superior to the humanistic studies. 
Indeed, our educational system is at present in the midst 
of a process of experimentation. The results thus far 
are not, it is true, satisfactory. The former means and 
methods produced a riper and more rounded develop- 
ment. But then what may we not expect when labor- 
atories wholly take the place of libraries, and the things 
of sense absorb our contemplation rather than the things 
of mind ? Certainly we may not expect any ministry 
"to our deepest spiritual needs," nor any of " the finer 
issues of thought and feeling, and the power to quicken 
other spirits to those issues." Darwin, on his knees 
studying the products of a square foot of soil, with one 
whole side of his nature, as he sadly confessed, " atro- 
phied," is the type of this sort of education. Plato, 
with his face upward, and his inward eye fixed on the 
more elusive but nobler realities of the soul, best rep- 
resents the other. And, however Thracian handmaid- 
ens may laugh at the one and extol the other, yet at the 
last " Wisdom is justified of her children." 

Plato's contention, " Until kings are philosophers or 
philosophers kings, cities will never cease from ill," may 
with equal truth be applied to colleges and schools. 
Educators need most of all to be psychologists and phil- 
osophers. They must have a thorough and sympathetic 
knowledge of the human mind and its orderly develop- 
ment. When they attain to this, they will confine to 
the universities, as alone appropriate to them, that sys- 
tem which places all studies on an equal footing and 
allows entire freedom of choice. They will at the same 
time recognize that the peculiar function of the college is 
not to make learned specialists, but to educate. It takes 
young men while still in their formative age, when prin- 
ciples and aims of life are being consciously determined. 
Therefore the course of study which it offers, while by 
no means excluding the natural sciences, should yet be 
largely mafle up of what De Quincey calls " the litera- 
ture of power " as distinguished from " the literature of 
knowledge." Indeed, it would be an excellent plan to 
write on the walls of every college, especially in the 
room where the faculty meets, the entire passage where 
this distinction is so finely drawn out.

DIALECT STUDY IN AMERICA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your last issue, Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler 
requests such scholars as will contribute to the English 
Dialect Dictionary to send their material either to the 
English or to the American editor. Permit me to sug- 
gest that trouble and inaccuracy may be avoided if all 
the material be sifted first in America. One obvious 
reason for this is furnished by the letter (published in 
the same number of THE DIAL) of Professor Bondu- 
rant, whose words certainly would imply, if they were 
not really meant to convey the impression, that axe (for 
ask), spunky, liefer, peart (in good health), clomb (pro- 
nounced clum), and right (for very), are peculiar to the 
dialect of Southern negroes, although all of them may 
be heard on occasion on Yankee farms or in a Yankee 
school-yard; where, too, "going" (when it is without 
accent) is pronounced gwine, thus: hwarya gon is 



" where are you going," but (in reply) " going home '* 
is gwine hum. Apropos of this, could not sentence ac- 
cent and syncope be noticed in rendering dialectic ex- 
pression ? We venture to doubt whether an uneducated 
negro ever used exactly the expression (cited by Pro- 
fessor Bondurant), " How is your old 'oman ? " Does not 
the darkey say always " Howsya old ? " In respect of 
shet of of shut of'm New England, both forms are heard. 
The idiom is common ; the pronounciation of the verb 
depends on that of the same word when it is used in the 
meaning " close," for the expression shut of is employed 
by them that would not in any circumstances say shet. 
In other words, the provincial idiom, as often happens,, 
survives the intrusion of the new pronunciation. In 
conclusion, may I ask Professor Wheeler what collec- 
tors are to do in the case of words like apron ? The pro- 
nunciations ap-run, a-prun, and a-purn (a-perri) are fre- 
quently heard not only in the same village but even in 
the same family; one of the forms being commonly the 
one taught by the schoolmaster (as far as I have ob- 
served the taught form in this instance is a-purn), and 
therefore of no value. It seems to me that it might be 
well for a committee of them that are interested in the 
matter to formulate some general rules by which col- 
lectors may govern themselves; and that all collections, 
whether made in accordance with these rules or not, 
before they are sent to England should be analyzed by 
a number of Americans who ought to represent differ-

"AXE" AND "SPUNKY" IN DIALECT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of the 16th inst. is an article by Alex- 
ander L. Bondurant, in which he speaks of " the negro 
dialect " as being " rich in survivals," and makes several 
quotations to support the fact. There can be no doubt 
as to the fact stated. Two of his instances, however, 
are of survivals by no means confined to negro or even 
Southern usage. Axe for ask is common in the East,, 
and I think also throughout the North and West ; it is an 
old Anglo-Saxon variant. It occurs in Lowell (" Biglow 
Papers: The Pious Editor's Creed " "I git jest wut I 
axes ") ; and I have frequently heard it in various New 
England States. 

The other word is spunky; and that word is used where- 
ever I have found any Scotch or Irish emigration and 
no part of our land is free from either. Both of these 
survivals are in common use by thousands who have never 
stood in any close connection with negroes.

LAFAYETTE AND MIRABEAU, ONCE MORE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It would probably be presumptuous on my part to- 
assume that the public are sufficiently interested in my 
writings to warrant my soliciting a second time some 
space to show up Mr. Shorey's most peculiar critical 
methods. But I venture to hope that THE DIAL will 
deem it its own interest as a leading critical journal to 
correct erroneous impressions, for which it has been 
made the vehicle by a contributor. 

Though I can well understand that Mr. Shorey " pre- 
fers " to shift the controversy to another ground, I must 
enter my protest against his doing so. Whether his or

THE DIAL 



my opinions of Mirabeau and Lafayette are correct, is 
not the issue raised by me. Neither would THE DIAL 
be the proper place for such a contention, nor would 
I anywhere enter upon it. My charge was distinctly 
that Mr. Shorey misrepresented me, partly by what he 
said and principally by what he did not say. Mr. Shorey, 
being a lawyer, must be familiar with the maxim that 
suppressio veri is no less an offence than suggestio falsi. 
This charge he has not even attempted to refute. I now 
reiterate it, adding that he has aggravated the offence 
as to myself and extended it to von Sybel and La Marck. 
He says my " charge relating to the conduct of Lafay- 
ette on the 5th and 6th of October, 1789, is supported 
on the authority of the light and frivolous Camille Des- 
moulins " intimating thereby that it is supported only 
on this authority. He keeps his readers in ignorance 
of the fact that I charge the General chiefly with " sins 
of omission " (II., 58), as to which no particular au- 
thority is needed; it is based upon the notorious facts, 
which have never been denied by anyone. He is pleased 
to ignore that I support my view besides by the report 
of the commission of the municipal council, a general 
reference to " the account of La Marck, who speaks 
as an eye-and-ear witness " (II., 63), and a "statement 
of Lafayette himself" (II., 59). The latter is of espe- 
cial import as an item of the circumstantial evidence, 
for, as I expressly state, " though it cannot be directly 
proved that Lafayette rather liked to be led to Ver- 
sailles, circumstantial evidence renders it likely " (II., 
61). By quoting one sentence of von Sybel, depicting 
in general terms Lafayette's character, Mr. Shorey pro- 
duces the impression that the eminent German historian 
is arrayed against me, while he must know, if he has 
read von Sybel, that this authority is altogether on my 
side. Not only is von Sybel's general estimate of La- 
fayette practically identical with mine, but also as to 
the 5th and 6th of October in particular does he make 
exactly the same charge, with this difference only, that 
he substantiates it more than I could do and that he 
formulates it more pointedly (I., 95-105, 4th ed.). 

That I, too, know of noble traits in Lafayette's char- 
acter, the reader of Mr. Shorey's articles is not likely 
to suspect. He will be surely not a little astonished to 
learn that I have written : " Not only his physical cour- 
age and his own belief in the intensity and perfect hon- 
esty of his lofty sentiments and aspirations are above 
suspicion; as to the negative side also his moral cour- 
age must be acknowledged to have been of a high or- 
der " (II., 142). On the other hand, who can suspect, 
from what Mr. Shorey has told him, that his glowing 
picture of the General is confronted in my lectures by 
Jefferson's charge that he had " a canine appetite for 
popularity " (II., 140) by the disparaging declarations 
of La Marck (II., 137, 143, 144), of whom he quotes 
in his first article only an appreciative opinion of a 
considerable number of damaging self-confessions of the 
General (II., 126, 127, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139) ? To 
an unbiased mind these things will be of greater weight 
than the array of historical writers, by which Mr. Shorey 
thinks he can crush me. To the unprofessional reader 
the list will, however, be imposing enough. Upon the 
historian it will with the exception of Taine make 
very little impression. The historian, though he will 
acknowledge Michelet, Martin, and Thiers to be names 
of weight, knows why they are not conclusive authori- 
ties as to Lafayette, apart from the fact that their books 
were written a good many years ago. 

What right has Mr. Shorey to declare his two quota- 



tions from letters to Mercy " the real opinion of La 
Marck in relation to Mirabeau," with the intimation 
that they contain his whole " real opinion," or that what 
he says in his letters to Mirabeau himself is not his real 
opinion ? Such an intimation in the face of what La 
Mark himself has declared to be his real opinion in his 
long " Introduction " to his correspondence with Mira- 
beau taking up more than half of the first volume 
is more than " surprising." Moreover, these quotations 
do not contain anything as to Mirabeau's " venality " or 
even his morality in general, and Mr. Shorey started to 
make up a case against me as to these. Now, as to the 
" venality," why does he not take any notice of Lafay- 
ette's opinion quoted by me (II., 179) that, though he 
" was not inaccessible to money," " for no amount would 
he have sustained an opinion that would have destroyed 
liberty and dishonored his mind " ? As to the morality 
in general was there any necessity whatever of mak- 
ing up a case against me ? Apparently the greatest, for 
Mr. Shorey says: "The author could not well avoid (!) 
stating damaging facts in relation to the character of 
Mirabeau. The question at issue is (!), whether the 
vices and venalities of Mirabeau explain his failure to 
win that confidence of colleagues which is necessary to 
a public man." I leave it to every fair-minded person 
to judge whether that is or is not grossly misrepresent- 
ing by suppressio veri an author, who writes : " But 
there is a third element indispensable in the make-up of 
a genuine statesman's character. The motives and the 
ends must be essentially moral. Was Mirabeau pos- 
sessed of this requisite ? Could (!) it be presumed that 
he possessed it ? It was this question that rendered his 
past an almost insurmountable barrier between him and 
success. Confidence he needed above all, and just this 
he found nowhere. It was bitter and cruel, but terribly 
true ( !) what the father had written : ' He gathers in 
what those reap who have failed as to the basis, the 
morals. . . . He will never obtain confidence, even if 
he tried to deserve it.' And it was by no means only 
the immorality of his youth that caused all to distrust 
him . . . Immorality was so deeply ingrained into his 
whole being, that it would crop out at the slightest pro- 
vocation or temptation ... he was ever lamentably 
ready to make it (the maxim that ' the petty morality 
kills the great morality ') a cloak for his inexcusable (!) 
moral trippings. . . . The moral pollution was certainly 
not only skin-deep. The whole blood was vitiated." 
(II., 236-238.) 

As I am precluded from assuming either that Mr. 
Shorey reckoned upon my not being able once more to 
gain access to the readers of THE DIAL, or that he in- 
tentionally wrongs me, I can find only one explanation 
for his proceeding: as to von Sybel, La Marck, and my- 
self, he has excused himself from reading our books as 
books and contented himself with reading sentences. 

He concludes his second paragraph with the exclama- 
tion, " Poor Camille ! " evidently expecting the reader 
to substitute for " Camille " von Hoist. With all defer- 
ence I submit that my humble name would not be the 
correct substitute. Whether a greater one could claim 
the honor with more propriety, is for the reader to de- 
cide. I herewith abandon the field to Mr. Shorey for 
good. Our way of reading historical books and our 
methods of investigating historical questions are so dif- 
ferent that, in my opinion, our crossing swords can no 
longer be of any benefit to either ourselves or the public.

THE RENASCENCE OF POE.* 



The appearance of a handsome illustrated 
edition of Poe's complete works, carefully ed- 
ited, opening with a memoir by Professor G. E. 
Woodberry and a special introduction to the 
tales by Mr. E. C. Stedman, is an event of 
considerable importance in the history of Poe's 
fame among his countrymen. For Poe has had 
the singular fortune to be praised with distinc- 
tion in some quarters abroad, while receiving 
generally but a qualified welcome at home. 
Baudelaire hastened to translate the author's 
complete works, with appreciative commentary, 
an act typical of the popular approbation be- 
stowed upon Poe in France to-day. Some of 
the tales have been rendered into Spanish and 
some into German. Ulissi Ortensi, finding the 
example of Baudelaire more potent than his 
warning precept, dared to turn all of the poems 
into musical Italian prose. Among English- 
men, James Hannay of the preceding genera- 
tion, and Professor Ernest Rhys of the present, 
have been intimate and favorable critics. In- 
gram's life of Poe, though discriminating, is 
friendly and full. In illustration of Poe's 
proposition that it takes a poet to catch a poet, 
Robert Browning presented to Mrs. Benzon a 
copy of the poems, dedicated, as were all the 
English editions, to Miss Barrett, and wrote 
on the fly-leaf that the book was given " partly 
on account of the poetry, partly on that of the 
dedication." Mr. Edmund Gosse, after criti- 
cal discussion of the more prominent makers 
of verse in this country, decided that, if Amer- 
ica has produced a great poet, Poe has the best 
claim to that sacred title. And Mr. Andrew 
Lang, in his " Letters to Dead Authors," ad- 
dresses the shade of Poe as that of " the great- 
est poet, perhaps the greatest literary genius," 
of his country. 

On the contrary, excluding the list of the 
poet's personal friends, where, hitherto, could 
we look among his own countrymen for an es- 
timate of his genius in which stinted praise 
should not be outweighed by abundant blame? 
His biographers, from the notorious perversion 
of Griswold to the accurate documentary life 
by Professor Woodberry, have seldom been 
sympathetic. Emerson's ear, insensible to

music, found nothing in Poe's verse but nursery 
jingles. Lowell, while allowing "three-fifths 
of him" to be "genius," precipitated a sharp 
rejoinder from his former friend by pronounc- 
ing the remainder fraction "sheer fudge." 
Nowadays, Professor Barrett Wendell, although 
naming Poe as one of the three distinctive 
American writers, condemns his work as " fan- 
tastic and meretricious throughout." He is ap- 
proached by Mr. Greenough White, with allit- 
erative compassion, as " poor Poe," " pessim- 
istic Poe," and " The Fall of the House of 
Usher " is preposterously discovered to be an 
allegory, shadowing autobiographically "the 
burial of conscience, and the ruin resulting 
therefrom." 

The present edition of Poe, with its commen- 
taries, makes some amends for past ill-treat- 
ment. Mr. Stedman had already shown in his 
" Poets of America" that he could appreciate 
Poe's verse with discrimination, and without 
patronage or pity. His estimate of the tales is 
judicious, weighing defects candidly, and mean- 
ing to make full recognition of Poe's intellec- 
tual genius. Occasionally a word seemed mis- 
applied, as when the sumptuous but incongruous 
furnishings of " The Assignation " are said to 
be " lauded " by the author and thus to evince 
his untutored taste. It seems gratuitous, too, 
to call " William Wilson " a " confession," and 
then urge that the author was not really so 
hardened in conscience as in this fiction he pre- 
tended to be. But the introduction to the tales, 
showing as it does a scholarly attempt to trace 
Poe's conceptions to sources in contemporary 
continental writers, must be accounted the work 
of an experienced and just-minded critic. The 
casual descriptive phrase, " a misfitted Amer- 
an," aptly expresses the sense of strangeness 
with which Poe has so long been regarded in 
the United States. The memoir, by Professor 
Woodberry, is excellent in its restraint. The 
story of the poet's life is told without com- 
ment, and the facts are left to make their own 
impression. How many authors, one asks, have 
to endure the printing of such intimate and un- 
braced correspondence as that here given (pp. 
52, 53), describing Poe's arrival in New York, 
almost penniless, with his consumptive wife, 
and his search for lodgings ? In this case the 
sartial friend, who considerately edits his sub- 
ject's correspondence, is absent. Every squalid 
and trivial detail is laid bare. 

The new edition is beautiful in paper and 
ypography, and the illustrations by Mr. Sterner 
are a distinct addition. Of course in all illus-

trations the artist's* conception is to be expected 
not the writer's ; for no draughtsman ever 
yet succeeded in exactly apprehending the wri- 
ter's idea, except the illustrator of " Trilby." 
But Mr. Sterner shows great sympathy with 
the weirdness and beauty that give tone to the 
tales. The three volumes already published 
include an unfamiliar sketch, " The Elk," their 
contents being subdivided ingeniously into ro- 
mances of death, old-world romance, tales of 
conscience, of natural beauty, of pseudo-science, 
of ratiocination, and of illusion. But perhaps 
the whole of Poe's work besides a dozen hu- 
morous and satirical sketches, in which the 
laughter is not genial but cool and sardonic 
may be said to fall into three groups : the im- 
aginative, the ratiocinative, and the critical, 
the first division including his verse and most 
of his tales. In his poetry Poe strove for novel 
stauzaic and melodic effects, in the conviction 
that the resources of English versification in 
this direction were not indicated by the few 
traditional forms. Believing also that the mu- 
sical element in verse is of great importance, 
he sought for sweet sounds, and used fully the 
devices of alliteration and the refrain. The 
melodious quality of his poetry is generally 
acknowledged, although difference of opinion 
exists concerning the relative value of sound 
in poetry. Those who delight in music for its 
own sake, however, will be slow to condemn his 
verse as too exclusively addressed to the ear. 
A more striking divergence of view is revealed 
on asking whether the poems are the outcome 
of personal feeling. Professor Woodberry, 
making Poe mainly a skilful artist, denies, in 
the " Life," that he ever experienced passion. 
So Mr. Stoddard : " There is a simulation of 
emotion in it [the poetry], but the emotion 
is as imaginary as the method by which it is 
sought to be conveyed is artificial." But Mr. 
Stedman, one is glad to note, takes the oppo- 
site view. The anecdote is well-known of Poe's 
quivering gratitude for unwonted kindness re- 
ceived at the hands of Mrs. Stanard, who in- 
spired the exquisite lyric " To Helen," and 
over whose grave the unforgetting boy used to 
brood by night. Many of Poe's published let- 
ters are written at so white a heat that the 
cold comma and period utterly fail to indicate 
the broken thought. He addressed his " Eu- 
reka " "to those who feel rather than to those 
who think," and this without the capacity him- 
self to feel ! He declared in the preface to his 
poems that poetry had been with him "not a pur- 
pose, but a passion," and some would doubtless 



explain this as the trick of a passionless man ! 
How can one receive the mournful cadences 
of " Ulalume," that dirge to a dead wife out 
of a mood rejecting the possibility of a newer 
love, and deny the poet's volcanic passion ? 
Even Mr. Woodberry, in his memoir, bears 
testimony to Poe's "ardent temperament," calls 
him "impetuous, self-willed, defiant," and 
quotes Mrs. Whitman concerning " his turbu- 
lent and passionate youth." In the words of 
his youthful poem, " Romance ": 

" And when an hour with calmer wings 
Its dawn upon my spirit flings 

That little time with lyre and rhyme 
To while away forbidden things ! 

My heart would feel to be a crime 
Unless it trembled with the strings." 

In his tales, Poe's imagination found wider 
expression than in his poems. True, the com- 
pass of his imaginative writing was restricted 
in the main to sombre and ghastly themes. Sev- 
eral causes were at work. Some account must 
be made of his pitiful struggles for subsistence 
in that America where, fifty years before the 
successful Mr. Howells gestured young men 
away from literature as a means of livelihood, 
the pen was indeed a feeble staff to lean one's 
whole weight upon. Poe knew " America, 
where, more than in any other region upon the 
face of the globe, to be poor is to be despised " 
(memoir, p. 57). An idealist, chained to hack- 
work for his daily bread, must in some way 
manifest the intrusion of penury into his 
dreams. The drink habit is the popular ex- 
planation of his wild creations, and it is not 
uncommon to adduce a finished tale, involving 
arduous artistic application, as the result of a 
night's debauch. But the principal cause of 
his " unearthliness " lay in the temperament 
which Poe had inherited from his forefathers. 
For good or bad, he was endowed with a mind 
that hovered by affinity over the grave, and 
dared to guess what might be immediately be- 
yond the phenomenon men call death. As re- 
lated in " Silence A Fable," he could not 
laugh with the Demon in the shadow of the 
tomb. But, restricted in scope as are the tales, 
their spell is undeniable. The writer has per- 
sonal acquaintance with at least one boy who 
again and again found himself caught away by 
these marvellous romances to a land of enchant- 
ment, from which the descent to earth was ab- 
rupt and dull. The boyish admiration has en- 
dured, now mingled with sober valuation of the 
consummate art that produces such results. 
The reader was not, so far as he is aware, at all 
morally unstrung, or even haunted with gob-

lin visions, by reason of what has been termed 
Poe's morbid fiction. And, while not discover- 
ing a self-drawn portrait of the author in every 
murderer and maniac that crosses the page, he 
does find that most important ingredient of 
sustained literary renown the distilled essence 
of life. 

It has been truly said that Poe's tales dis- 
play the conceptions of an idealist, conveyed 
through the method of a realist. Nothing could 
be in greater contrast with the commonplace 
narratives of the modern school than the gor- 
geous finishings, the impossible incidents, the 
unparalleled characters of Poe's dreamy ro- 
mances. Yet the calculating accumulation of 
detail, each particular being easily credible be- 
cause so exactly stated, leads the reader step 
by step to cross the boundary of the actual, and 
to tabernacle for a time in a land of shadows. 
It is only at the close, awakening from his illu- 
sion, that he can perceive the constructive art 
which admits no useless circumstance, fully pre- 
pares for the conclusion, yet conceals the denoue- 
ment until it flashes out like a lightning-stroke. 

Few men of imagination are gifted in com- 
mensurate degree with the power of analytical 
reasoning. Poe exemplified his dictum that to 
reason well one must share the nature of both 
poet and mathematician. His ratiocinative 
power is shown in the five tales grouped in the 
present edition. It has been objected, and by 
Poe himself, that little credit is due for unrav- 
elling a web of one's own tangling ; but the 
point at issue is whether the fictitious situation 
is illustrative of actual affairs. " The Purloined 
Letter," for example, is a case under the ob- 
served law that the most obvious fact is fre- 
quently the fact perceived with the greatest 
difficulty. It will be remembered, too, that Poe 
proved his faculty of analysis when the answer to 
the problem was not predetermined by himself 
in solving numerous difficult ciphers, in fathom- 
ing the mystery surrounding the murder of 
Mary Rogers, in guessing from the first chap- 
ters the development of " Barnaby Rudge." 
Moreover, Poe possessed not merely analytical 
insight, but the ability to express in clear lan- 
guage the steps of his mental process. Doubt- 
less other spectators guessed the secret of Mael- 
zel's mechanical chess-player, but nobody else 
gave so logical and convincing an account of 
his reasoning. One is almost ready, before 
the clearness of his philosophical exposition, to 
say with him that no thought is beyond the 
reach of expression in language. 

The most remarkable outcome of his com- 



bined imaginative and ratiocinative power is 
the so-called prose poem " Eureka." Not in 
effect, say astronomers, what it purports to be 
an explanation of the material universe. 
" Nonsense ! " ejaculates the scientist, as he 
turns from the prefatory note : "I offer this 
book of Truths, not in its character of Truth- 
Teller, but for the Beauty that abounds in its 
Truth ; constituting it true." Yet the work 
remains the expression of a gigantic effort to 
go behind the most general laws of science, to 
account for the attraction of gravitation, to en- 
ter into the thought of God at the moment of 
creation, to reduce to a single impulse of the 
Divine Will the multitudinous phenomena of 
created things. The author requests that his 
work be judged after his death, as a poem only ; 
but nobody seems willing to oblige him. From 
the purely intellectual point of view, it will be 
granted that this attempt to furnish a founda- 
tion for Kepler and Laplace is at least ingen- 
ious and bold. If judged as a " prose poem," 
it takes rank among the striking products of 
the creative imagination. 

To Poe as critic, a few contemptuous words 
have commonly been thrown. He is said to 
have been unguided by principles, prejudiced, 
ferocious. It will be acknowledged that, with 
a fine native appreciation for good writing, he 
lacked the judicial temperament. He was liable 
to be swayed by his personal likes and dislikes. 
According to the editor of the once popular 
" Graham's Magazine," " No man with more 
readiness would soften a harsh expression at 
the request of a friend." But that Poe had re- 
flected upon the principles of composition, his 
several well-known essays on the subject abund- 
antly prove. His definition of poetry as the 
rhythmical creation of beauty, having its effect 
in elevating excitement of the soul, stands side 
by side with a score of other similar though 
partial statements, which must serve us while 
we await the perfect definition. Poe tested 
poetry by reading it aloud. He ascribed the 
varied musical effects of verse to the principle 
of equality. He opposed allegory and humor 
in poetry, thought the Greek drama manifestly 
the outgrowth of a cruder age, and the older 
English poetry over-praised because of its an- 
tiquity. He corrected Coleridge's distinction 
between fancy and imagination, showing that 
neither faculty truly creates. Among the qual- 
ities that he was accustomed to praise, in crit- 
ical consideration of poetry, were truth or nat- 
uralness, imagination, rhythmic effect, melody, 
force, grace, abandon, and what he called keep-

ing, or propriety of treatment. In fiction, as in 
verse, originality was the quality placed high- 
est, then constructive ability, imagination, and 
" the minor merits of style," meaning rhetor- 
ical and grammatical accuracy. 

In the application of his criticism, Poe 
praised Bulwer, Dickens, Scott, Moore, Cole- 
ridge, Tennyson. He placed Longfellow at the 
head of American poets, and Bryant second in 
rank. Hawthorne was warmly welcomed, long 
before the populace had discovered his merits. 
Lowell, before his witty characterization of Poe 
in the "Fable for Critics," was defended against 
an attack of Blackwood as " one of the noblest 
of our poets." Bayard Taylor, Margaret Ful- 
ler, and Mrs. Osgood are hailed as accessions 
to letters. But Emerson, Carlyle, and the tran- 
scendentalists generally, were beyond the ro- 
mancer's sympathetic reach. In reading the 
long list of good, bad, and indifferent authors 
treated, one's chief wonder is not that the critic 
was ferocious, as he occasionally was, but that 
he found so much to commend in what time 
has adjudged a wilderness of mediocrity. To 
the women poets of America, in particular, he 
was uniformly kind, not blind. He was so far 
influenced by the " Edinburgh Review " as to 
hold that the merits of a literary work might 
be left to speak for themselves, but that the 
cause of good writing would be best sustained 
by a rigorous exposure of defects, with little 
regard to the feelings of the author. No fair- 
minded man, reading the whole of Poe's criti- 
cism, can doubt that he had at heart the dig- 
nity and permanence of American letters. His 
defects were defects of temperament. 

The most prominent attack made by Poe as 
critic was upon Longfellow, whom he indi- 
rectly accused of plagiarism. With his wor- 
ship of originality, he had a mania for expos- 
ing what he deemed imitation ; and it must be 
allowed that, although his parallels are not 
always convincing, he rarely makes a charge 
without adducing his evidence. In the case 
of Longfellow, the discussion was lengthened 
through a well-meant defence by one of the 
friends of the gentle Cambridge poet. Poe 
really admired Longfellow's genius, praised his 
artistic skill and ideality, and ranked him, as 
has been said, at the head of American poets. 
In his article on the drama, Poe says : 
" Throughout ' The Spanish Student,' as well 
as throughout the other compositions of its au- 
thor, there runs a very obvious vein of imita- 
tion. We are perpetually reminded of some- 
thing we have seen before some old acquaint- 



ance in manner or matter ; and even when the 
similarity cannot be said to amount to plagiar- 
ism, it is still injurious to the poet in the good 
opinion of him who reads." If we turn to the 
delicate and sympathetic estimate of Mr. Sted- 
man, we shall find him saying, before claiming 
for Longfellow the credit of a distinctive tone, 
or manner of treatment : " Reviewing our sum- 
mary of his work, I observe that each of his 
best known efforts has led to the mention of 
prose or verse by some other hand which it re- 
sembles. In view of the possible inference, we 
may now ask, Was Longfellow, then, with his 
great reputation and indisputable hold upon 
our affections, not an original poet ? It must 
be acknowledged at the outset that few poets 
of his standing have profited more openly by 
examples that suited their tastes and purposes. 
The evidence of this is seen not merely in three 
or four, but in a great number, of his produc- 
tions." To quote once more from Mr. Gosse: 
" Originality and greatness are precisely the 
qualities Longfellow lacks." It appears from 
this collation of passages that the three critics, 
differing as they do in emphasis, have in mind 
one and the same fact. 

What are the grounds on which this unique 
writer, now enjoying a renascence of his fame, 
may rest a claim to genius ? We recognize 
with him that " perseverence is one thing, 
genius quite another." But to define genius is 
a desperate task. Still, among its trusty marks 
may be named intensity, a junction at some 
point with the infinite, and permanence of 
power. These three qualities are revealed in 
the work of Poe. Into his best writing he 
poured the whole of his life, containing springs 
of feebleness as well as of might, which rose 
from sources beyond his contriving. Such as 
it was, his inmost and hottest soul was concen- 
trated upon the work of his hand. His thought 
joined too with the infinite and the immortal. 
Although pausing long at the brink of the 
grave, and noting too carefully the repulsive 
details of worm and shroud, it welcomed the 
life that is in death the restful escape from 
" the fever called ' Living.' ' The present 
publication is testimony that Poe's hold upon 
men is unweakened. Wrapped within those 
imaginative legends lies the touch that still 
moves, if but to shudder. Here is a man whose 
swelling ambition strove to do infinite things 
upon a finite stage. Let us accept him as a 
child of genius, and enshrine him forever as an 
eminent figure in the literature of our nation.

ART IN PRIMITIVE GREECE.* 



The two volumes on the Art of Primitive 
Greece are the beginning of the end of what 
must be considered the most complete and 
thorough history of ancient art ever written. 
Many years ago Georges Perrot (aided by 
Charles Chipiez) began the monumental task 
of gathering up and sifting all the material of 
ancient art and putting it together in sequen- 
tial and chronological form. It was in 1882 
that the first volumes, treating of Egyptian art, 
appeared ; and since then we have followed M. 
Perrot, trusting to his knowledge, sagacity, 
and judgment, through the arts of the Chal- 
daeans, Assyrians, Persians, and all the coast 
people of Asia Minor. At last he has brought 
us to Greece his objective point from the 
start. For he told us in his first book that 
" beyond the obelisks and pyramids of Egypt, 
beyond the towers of Chaldsea and the domes 
of Nineveh, the lofty colonnades of Persepolis, 
the fortresses and rock-cut tombs of Phrygia 
and Lycia, beyond the huge ramparts of the 
cities of Syria, we shall never cease to perceive 
on the horizon the sacred rock of the Athenian 
Acropolis." Greece, to M. Perrot, furnished 
the climax of all ancient art ; but it must not 
be inferred that the preceding volumes on 
Egyptian and Oriental art are merely introduc- 
tory to this climax. On the contrary, each 
volume is in itself a complete statement of its 
subject an exhaustive array of all the facts 
and a careful considering of all the theories. 

The series begins with the beginning in 
Egypt, and is designed to end with the Roman 
art of Marcus Aurelius. The complete work 
is to cover fifteen or sixteen volumes. Twelve 
of them are now published, and, judging from 
these, the statement that they form the best 
history of ancient art ever written is not a rash 
one. No historian of art has ever covered so 
much ground in so scholarly a manner as Georges 
Perrot. Winckelmann, Schnaase, Woltmann 
and Woermann, Reber, never had adequate 
knowledge to start with, never had breadth of 
view to carry with, never had aesthetic taste to 
judge with. M. Perrot possesses all of these 
qualities, and what must be somewhat hu- 
miliating to those who hug the idea that only 
Germany can produce historians he is a 
Frenchman. It seems to be thought in some 
quarters that however clumsy and dull a plod-

ez. In two volumes. New York : A. C. Armstrong & Son. 



der the German may be he is wonderfully 
thorough and accurate ; and that the easy style 
of the Frenchman argues a superficial view 
of questionable facts. However well-founded 
that idea may be as regards theology and phil- 
osophy, it is not well-founded as regards science, 
letters, archaeology, and art. In taste, judg- 
ment, accuracy, and perspicacity, the French- 
man is to be trusted ; and these books by 
Georges Perrot are warrant for saying so. They 
are the most modern, but not the first, instance 
of French scholarship. We shall wait a long 
time before any German or Italian or English- 
man equals them. 

Nevertheless, the reading of these last vol- 
umes on Mycenian art causes a shade of dis- 
appointment. When a writer would do some- 
thing " very fine," he is likely to overshoot the 
mark ; and M. Perrot evidently intended his 
treatment of Greek art to be convincing to the 
last degree. He begins and ends with a theory, 
and one wonders at times whether he is not 
straining facts to make them square with the 
theory. In brief, notwithstanding great cau- 
tion and a putting of all the pros and cons, M. 
Perrot believes with Schliemann in Troy and 
Mycenae, in the ancestors of the Greeks start- 
ing there 2000 years B.C., in the growth of 
Greek art from this Mycenian art ; he believes 
in the time-honored and somewhat fallacious 
theory of evolution. It cannot be said that his 
theory is impossible or even improbable. In- 
deed, it is made quite plausible ; and yet one 
may question whether it is the archaeologist's or 
historian's business to theorize to such an extent. 
Groping in the dark of the past, perhaps the 
best that one could do would be to emphasize 
the facts so that they may be used as guide- 
posts hereafter. These hypotheses may be only 
card-houses to be knocked over. The mound 
upon which Troy is supposed to have rested 
contains three strata, each one reflective of a 
different stage of civilization. From that we 
have the theory that the stone-age man of the 
first stratum was the lineal ancestor of the 
bronze-age Trojan of the third stratum. Let 
us see how it might have been. The city of 
St. Louis is destroyed by earthquake, buried, 
forgotten. Two thousand years hence it is dug 
up by archaeologists. They find three strata, 
showing remains of three different peoples. 
They first dig out the remains of a thirteen- 
story building, then a log hut, and under all 
they find mound-builders' pottery. Ergo, the 
present people of St. Louis must have evolved 
from their ancestors the Mound Builders !

M. Perrot, of course, draws no such absurd 
conclusion ; but one feels at times as though 
he had not given enough weight to the possi- 
bilities of invading and conquering hosts, and 
of the Greek people being formed not from 
any one race but from many races mingled. 
The 2Egean swarmed with all sorts of adven- 
turers in Mycenian days. Tribes came and 
went ; settlements were made, conquered, and 
re-made ; and who were the ancestors of the 
Greeks, we do not yet know. There is no cor- 
roborative evidence that the buildings, orna- 
ments, vases, and other remains that have been 
found at Troy and elsewhere, are Greek, except 
in some passages from the epic of Homer a 
record itself to be proven. There is not a line 
or scratch of writing, on clay or wall or stone, 
to indicate a Greek people. The only evidence 
lies in the remains themselves. It is true, these 
differ from all relics we now know of as being 
found on the shores of the eastern Mediterra- 
nean ; yet they have an affinity with oriental 
art that suggests the possibility of their pro- 
duction by a now-forgotten race that was not 
Greek at all. Again, the Mycenian pottery 
might have been only a commercial ware 
hawked about the Mediterranean by traders. 
It is found elsewhere than at Troy and My- 
cenae ; and when the diggings in Phoenicia equal 
those at Mycenae, it may be found in as large 
quantities. As for Schliemann and his discov- 
eries, he rendered great service to archaeology 
by his excavations, but his theory was formed 
before he began to dig. He started out to find 
Troy and Agamemnon's tomb, and he found 
them. Had he been seeking Aladdin's lamp 
he would have found it in the first junk-shop 
of the Mouski. 

But M. Perrot is not dogmatic in his theory. 
These volumes are really an elaborate and 
learned discussion of the question ; and if, 
finally, the leaning is toward Schliemann's con- 
clusions, it is not an arbitrary bias. If the value 
of the theory can be questioned, the manner in 
which it is put forth cannot. The critical and 
historical spirit pervades the discussion, and 
the truth is sought for. Aside from this the- 
ory, there is little to question or find fault with 
in the work. The opening chapter, on the 
country, is a close study of geography, soil, cli- 
mate, and all that, by a man who knows his 
Greece almost as well as he does his Paris. 
Greek genius is not accounted for except by 
saying that it cannot be accounted for, and M. 
Perrot accepts the Aryan theory of the Greeks 
populating Greece by land and by sea from the 



East. At the same time he thinks that " until 
proof is shown to the contrary, we are bound 
to recognize in the folk who fashioned them 
[stone implements found in Greece] the direct 
ancestors of the Greeks of history." In other 
words, Greece had its stone age, and stumbled 
up through ages of bronze and iron to Periclean 
splendor, notwithstanding the forefathers of the 
race came from the East. Perhaps so ; but it 
is not yet proven. 

Once out of the land of speculation and evo- 
lution, and describing art-remains before him, 
M. Perrot becomes an archaeologist again ; and 
his accounts of Troy, Tiryns, and Mycena3 are 
as intelligent and painstaking as possible. He 
thinks the evidence is for Hissarlik being the 
ancient site of Troy ; and that the tombs at 
Mycenae are those described by Pausanias. The 
domed tombs of Attica and at Orchomenos, 
the wall construction of the Athenian Acrop- 
olis, the remains found on the Greek islands, 
are all brought in to prove the prevalence of 
primitive modes of construction during the My- 
cenian civilization. The chapters on the gen- 
eral characteristics of Mycenian architecture, 
materials, gates, columns, mouldings, are ex- 
cellent ; and here M. Perrot's collaborator, M. 
Charles Chipiez, comes in with restorations of 
the tombs and walls most ingeniously wrought 
out and undoubtedly correct. 

In the second volume, M. Perrot decides 
against Schliemann's Homeric theory of tem- 
ples and incineration as not proven ; he does 
not give the origin of the architectural forms, 
thinks the Doric column did not come from 
Egypt but was evolved from the wooden struc- 
ture of the last Mycenian civilization, deals sen- 
sibly with what is left of the sculpture, paint- 
ing, and industrial arts including pottery, and 
ends with a chapter on the characteristics of the 
Mycenian period. Here at the last he returns 
to his theory, and finds a date for the heyday 
of Mycenian existence at 1500 B.C. The only 
outside evidence that supports the date comes 
from Egypt a questionable record of Egypt- 
ian commerce with the Greeks in that early pe- 
riod. The finding of Egyptian scarabs, sherds, 
pastes, and glasses, on the Greek islands and 
the mainland, does not confirm the record, since 
they probably came from Phrenicia. 

The translation of this work cannot be 
praised. Mr. I. Gonino, who has succeeded 
Mr. Walter Armstrong as translator of the 
series, has used the pruning knife " to slightly 
abridge the text in those portions that are some- 
what tumid with padding," and judging from 



144

his own "tumidity" he has not done it well. 
Moreover, though Mr. Gonino may understand 
French he does not know how to write flexible 
English. Such sentences as these are not in- 
frequent : " Nobody knows and never will 
know," " Colored stones which pleasure the 
eye," " We should doubtless have been justi- 
fied to infer," " So scanty a piece of informa- 
tion, however, cannot dispense us from devot- 
ing a special study," etc. Then the pedantry 
of " Hadriatic " and " Achylles," the angular- 
ity of " gracility " for slenderness, and the stu- 
pidity of " When the excavator tumbled about 
Grecian soil," etc., which might give one to 
understand that the excavator " tumbled " in- 
stead of the soil. But the book is welcome, 
and will live in spite of Mr. Gonino's English.

HENRY OF NAVARRE.* 



On one side, biography touches the novel ; 
on the other, history. The interest may attach 
chiefly to the individuality of the subject and 
the romance of his personal development : this 
allies the book with fiction. But if the subject 
of the biography took strong hold of the life 
of his time, left his mark upon social and gov- 
ernmental institutions, the account of his career 
is naturally an intimate part of the history of 
his age and country. Henry IV. of France de- 
serves the latter method of treatment. His life 
furnishes material for more than enough cham- 
bering romances, it is true ; but the last twelve 
years of his life, filled with intense and benefi- 
cent activity, are more valuable to the student 
than all the rest, and belong to history in the 
best sense. 

The biographer of Henry of Navarre must 
depend largely on the Memoirs of Sully, and 
it is to be regretted that Mr. Blair should not 
have used more freely the latter part of that 
interesting record. Of his 300 pages, 204 are 
consumed before Henry becomes King of 
France, 63 pages are devoted to the following 
nine years, and but 32 pages to the last twelve 
years of his life. A more detailed analysis 
shows 130 pages given to events and persons 
not essential to the understanding of Henry's 
career as here outlined ; and of the remainder, 
nine pages to Beam and Henry's parentage 
and birth, twenty-one pages to his amours and

Edward T. Blair. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



marital infelicities, about sixty to his military 
career, and sixty to miscellaneous details largely 
incidental or anecdotal. Of the last chapter, 
covering the most important period of the king's 
career, two and one-half pages only are given 
to the governmental reforms for which it is fa- 
mous, while ten pages go to amours and details 
of Henry's second marriage, three to personal 
anecdotes, one to Sully, five to his " grand de- 
sign," and three and one-half to the close of the 
king's life. 

This lack of proportion is a serious defect, 
from whatever point of view one regards Mr. 
Blair's work. Yet there is enough that is mer- 
itorious in it to make one wish that he had 
saved for a second and revised edition the typo- 
graphical luxury and wealth of illustration with 
which the publishers have equipped it. The 
style is straightforward, and in the main cor- 
rect, barring an occasional lapse such as " he 
was said to have translated" (p. 17), "thrown 
in the river " (p. 145), " each [Mayenne and 
Lorraine] claimed this honor for their sons " 
(p. 241), " to see if he could not arrange mat- 
ters " (p. 261), " I had to act marshal as re- 
garded the retreat " (p. 265). A few foreign 
barbarisms, as " reiter " for cavalry, " lanz- 
knechts " for lansquenets or infantry, " ruse," 
" croqued," " gabelle," would have been better 
omitted ; and with them " showed their hand " 
and " squabbled." 

Of course, like all who depend upon a few 
standard sources, Mr. Blair often closely ap- 
proaches the language of one of these without 
using quotation-marks. In some instances 
where Guizot has neglected to quote his source, 
Mr. Blair has doubtless used the same author- 
ity, so that the arrangement of his matter 
and even the language itself resemble Guizot. 
For instance, Blair, p. 25 : " Montmorency paid 
the greatest attention to the discipline of his 
troops." Guizot, IV., 335 : " The same man 
paid the greatest attention to the discipline and 
good condition of his troops." Blair, p. 28 : 
" The Bishop of Arras who was present offered 
to assist him. 'Gently, my lord of Arras,' 
said the Emperor, '. . .' Then he turned to 
Coligny, '. . .' He inquired after Henry II. 's 
health, and spoke of belonging to the house of 
France through his grandmother Mary of Bur- 
gundy." Guizot, IV., 250 : " The Bishop of 
Arras drew near to render him that service. 
' Gently, my lord of Arras,' said the Emperor 
- [quotation identical] . And then turning 
to Coligny he said [quotation identical]. He 
inquired with an air of interest after Henry II.'s 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



145 



health, and boasted of belonging himself also 
to the house of France through his grandmother 
Mary of Burgundy." Blair, p. 29 : "It was 
not long before the truce was broken, although 
it cost Coligny, who was a man of scrupulous 
honor, a struggle to do it." Guizot, IV., 250 : 
" And it was not long before this prognostica- 
tion was verified. ... It cost Coligny, who 
was a man of scrupulous honor, a great strug- 
gle to lightly break a truce he had just signed." 
Other instances are, Blair, pp. 25-6 : Guizot, 
IV., 236 ; Blair, 27 : Guizot IV., 245 ; Blair, 
29: Guizot, IV., 253 ; Blair, 31: Guizot, IV., 
260 ; Blair, 32 : Guizot, IV., 261 ; Blair, 97 : 
Guizot, IV., 392; Blair, 103: Guizot, IV., 
368 and 369. Perhaps the free use of sources, 
even in the absence of quotation-marks, should 
be understood as a matter of course in such 
works as this. 

An author has a right to be judged from his 
own point of view. Mr. Blair tells us that he 
was moved to undertake the biography of Henry 
of Navarre by a two-years residence in Beam, 
together with the consideration that there was 
so little accessible in English on the subject, 
and that he has been guided only by the desire 
to treat impartially what has been much dis- 
torted by partisans. However, there is consid- 
erable accessible in English as Sully's Mem- 
oirs, Guizot, Duruy, Kitchin, Baird's " Rise of 
the Huguenots," etc.; and a scholarly work sum- 
marizing what these and more original author- 
ities furnish on the life of Henry IV. is what 
is really needed. But Mr. Blair's " Henry of 
Navarre " lays no claim to scholarship. It cites 
no sources, it has not a single reference to au- 
thorities, it does not even make acknowledg- 
ment of indebtedness to the writers from whom 
the author has evidently drawn. Dates are not, 
indeed, an infallible mark of erudition, and we 
could dispense with a portion of them in many 
excellent works, but it is a bold innovation to 
omit them altogether. There are but three in 
this record of fifty years where events often lap 
and the narrator has occasion to reach ahead or 
turn back several years. Even in a popular 
work, such as this is intended to be "a brief 
description of one of the most interesting char- 
acters and periods in French history," - a 
moderate use of at least marginal dates, and a 
short list of standard authorities, would have 
been decidedly helpful. 

Looked at as a popular narrative which pre- 
sumes some knowledge of the period, Mr. Blair's 
work takes on a more favorable aspect. The 
elegant typography and the numerous illustra- 



tions constitute larger factors of the whole, and 
the tendency to piquancy is more pardonable. 
Yet here, too, there are serious defects. Often 
much is taken for granted. A personage ap- 
pears in action or reference, only to be formally 
introduced some pages later, or not at all. Per- 
sonages of the same name are not distinguished 
with enough care, and the same person is some- 
times referred to by different names without 
being identified. Thus Maximilien de Bethune, 
baron de Rosny, due de Sully, first appears un- 
announced on page 127 : " When Sully went 
to Henry III. to conclude an alliance between 
him and the King of Navarre "; while the next 
reference to him is 011 page 143 : " Even grave 
puritans like Rosny, afterwards Duke of Sully." 
This is not calculated to enlighten us, but the 
contrary ; for as he was only " afterwards Duke 
of Sully," how could the Sully of the previous 
reference be the same ? Throughout, the great 
minister is called, now Rosny, now Sully, now 
" Rosny afterwards Duke of Sully." So also 
with the Duke of Anjou, who is three different 
personages in the pages of the book, and, even 
when Henry III. is meant, is not identified, 
especially on page 122, where he is referred to 
as King of Poland, and in the next breath as 
Anjou, without any hint of how Anjou came 
to be king of Poland. Similar is the allusion 
to the " Seize," p. 214. Perhaps no precau- 
tions could prevent some confusion in the case 
of the numerous representatives of the Guise 
family ; but here, as elsewhere, a freer use of 
baptismal names in connection with the title 
would have helped matters. 

Mr. Blair has been impressed with the dif- 
ficulty of giving an unprejudiced view of the 
massacre of St. Bartholomew, and he has an 
evident desire to be fair. His epitome of the 
origin of the dreadful affair as " the accidental 
result of a conspiracy directed against the ad- 
miral, rather than an organized effort to exter- 
minate the Protestants " (p. 112), is undoubt- 
edly correct of the situation preceding the first 
attempt on Coligny's life, but after that a 
greater guilt was assumed by Catherine and 
her sons. However little they may have fore- 
seen or intended the ultimate results, the bur- 
den of infamy remaining upon them is great 
enough to justify the perpetual execrations 
of mankind. It would be interesting to know 
where Mr. Blair finds the evidence that " Prot- 
estant historians have agreed to pillory her 
[Catherine] for the benefit of posterity " (p. 
39). It may be true that a certain class of 
Sunday-School library books overdraw her 



146

guilt ; but is there a standard historian who 
does not present the same view as Mr. Blair ? 
Guizot, Duruy, Kitchin, Baird, Steven, as 
well as the contemporaries Henry III. and Sal- 
viati, the papal nuncio, are in general accord 
with Mr. Blair. It does not seem that his 
charge of a conspiracy to blacken Catherine's 
character is justified. Aspersions like this, and 
that on page 85, " Protestant historians pre- 
tend to see in all this a deep-laid scheme to de- 
lude the Huguenots into a sense of security," 
ought to be supported by evidence. 

There is enough of value in Mr. Blair's work 
to make one regret profoundly that he should 
not have deliberated longer, and received more 
criticism, before printing in such sumptuous 
form. As in the case of the text, so with the 
fifty or more half-tone prints and photogravures 
accompanying it : most readers would be grat- 
ified to know the source and the artist of the 
originals. W. H. CARRUTH. 



A NEW ENGLAND 



The conscience of New England a half cen- 
tury ago demanded much of its votaries and 
adherents. The limitations which it set about 
human intelligence and activity were many and 
certain. Its intense assurance of its own com- 
pleteness and rectitude had its incommodities 
as well as its insights and rewards. To those 
who could acquiesce in its demands, it opened 
avenues to spiritual heights whence the out- 
look was large and superb, though the air might 
be somewhat thin for the health of daily life. 
At last, however, the burdens it imposed be- 
came too severe for a generation alive to much 
that was outside of its enclosed space, and the 
revolt began. 

It seems that valuable literatures usually be- 
gin with such revolts, and the stronger spirits, 
after considerable effort and some suffering, 
throw off the fetters no longer endurable, and 
rejoice in the larger freedom which they have 
won. There are always, however, sensitive souls 
who feel that they must break with the tradi- 
tions, but cannot find themselves wholly at 
home in the new and strange. Among the lat- 
ter must be counted such writers as Emily 
Dickinson, as well as the Concord recluse, 
William Ellery Channing, whose poems, when 
again and properly presented to the world, will

doubtless receive a recognition which has thus 
far been denied them. What has been done 
for Emily Dickinson will assuredly be done for 
him, and the result is no more doubtful in his 
case than it has proved in hers. 

Miss Dickinson's letters make an admirable 
complement to her poems. In her early years 
she was a copious correspondent, and during 
her school-days she had a great reputation as a 
writer of long, and, as we can readily surmise, 
singularly original compositions. The change 
in her epistolary style, with her growth in years 
and experience, is worthy of notice. The dif- 
fuse and minute letter- writing becomes con- 
densed to a remarkable degree, epigrammatic, 
and mystical. Her correspondents were many, 
and include such names as Dr. Holland, Sam- 
uel Bowles, Helen Hunt Jackson, and, of 
course, Mrs. Todd, the devoted editor of these 
" Letters," and her guide and mentor, Colonel 
Higginson. 

Not quite able to avail herself of the wider 
scope which the New England revolt was dis- 
closing to her, and incapable of satisfaction 
with the creeds and moods in which she had 
been brought up, Emily Dickinson retired into 
herself, and found solace and serenity in her 
vivid apprehensions of the truth, and the man- 
ifestations of that truth in Nature, which be- 
came to her a symbol easily read and trans- 
parent to the meaning which it contained. Her 
correspondence is replete with a gay and deli- 
cate humor ; the recluse was full of wit and of 
gentle happiness with her friends. Perhaps 
she did not take herself and her abandonment 
of the world with too much seriousness ; prob- 
ably she saw something of its humorous aspect, 
and would gladly enough have had the strength 
to share the generous life outside ; the effort, 
doubtless, was too great, and the sympathetic 
appreciation not sufficiently vigorous and in- 
sistent. The letters are free from that strain 
of morbidness which we sometimes find in her 
poems, especially in those dealing with the 
subject of death and its dark accompaniments. 
Here we have such exquisite passages as this : 
" The bed on which he came was enclosed in a large 
casket, shut entirely, and covered from head to foot 
with the sweetest flowers. He went to sleep from the 
village church. Crowds came to tell him good night, 
choirs sang to him, pastors told how brave he was 
early-soldier heart. And the family lowered their heads, 
as the reeds the wind shakes." 

As the introspective habit grew upon her, 
every incident of a life simple and unvarying 
in the extreme became touched with an illu- 
mination that her thoughts and mood poured

forth. " A letter," she says, " always feels to 
me like immortality, because it is the mind 
alone without corporeal friend." A burst of 
severe weather in the spring gives rise to this : 
*' The apple blossoms were slightly disheart- 
ened, yesterday, by a snow-storm, but the birds 
encouraged them all that they could and how 
fortunate that the little ones had come to cheer 
their damask brethren." Here is a letter entire : 
" The little package of Ceylon arrived iu fragrant 
safety, and Caliban's ' elust'ring filberds ' were not so 
luscious nor so brown. Honey in March is blissful as 
inopportune, and to caress the bee a severe temptation, 
but was not temptation the first zest ? We shall seek 
to be frugal with our sweet possessions, though their en- 
ticingness quite leads us astray, and shall endow Austin 
[Emily Dickinson's brother], as we often do, after a 
parched day. For how much we thank you. Dear ar- 
rears of tenderness we can never repay till the will's 
great ores are finally sifted; but bullion is better than 
minted things, for it has no alloy. Thinking of you with 
fresher love, as the Bible boyishly says, ' New every 
morning and fresh every evening.' " 

The unexpected abounds in these letters, as 
the reader of the poems will anticipate. " To 
make even Heaven more heavenly is within the 
aim of us all." " I shall bring you a handful 
of Lotus next, but do not tell the Nile." " Not 
what the stars have done, but what they are to 
do, is what detains the sky." " Changelessness 
is Nature's change." She lavishes her verse 
upon her correspondents. 

" Take all away from me 

But leave me ecstasy, 

And I am richer then 

Than all my fellow-men. 

Is it becoming me 

To dwell so wealthily, 

When at my very door 

Are those possessing more, 

In boundless poverty ? " 

Mrs. Todd says : " It is impossible to con- 
ceive that any sense of personal isolation, or 
real loneliness of spirit, because of the absence 
of humanity from her daily life, could have op- 
pressed a nature so richly endowed." And 
again : " Emily Dickinson's method of living 
was so simple and natural an outcome of her 
increasingly shy nature, a development so per- 
fectly in the line of her whole constitution, that 
no far-away and dramatic explanation of her 
quiet life is necessary to those who are capable 
of apprehending her." Notwithstanding the 
authoritative source from which this statement 
comes, many readers will hold a different opin- 
ion. No doubt the adjustment of Emily Dick- 
inson to her environment grew in difficulty, and, 
as often happens in such cases, the effective 
help was not at hand. The extent of her cor- 
respondence, and the character of much of it, 



indicate how deeply she felt the need and how 
warmly she would have welcomed the possibil- 
ity of closer relations with her fellows. The 
nun and the saint make a figure delicate and 
unique ; but the poet with something real to 
say to mankind deserves our larger apprecia- 
tion- Louis J. BLOCK. 



STUDIES IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.* 

One of the most exceedingly live " questions of 
the day " the pressing and often distressing prob- 
lem of municipal government is treated in some 
of its more salient phrases in four interesting books 
of recent publication. The city is the form which 
society is inceasingly assuming. The rural mode 
of life, once so controlling of all social facts, is 
more and more sinking to a secondary place. When 
the war of the American Revolution ended, only about 
three per cent of our people lived in what might be 
called cities ; and the metropolis, Philadelphia, was 
a town of only some forty thousand inhabitants. 
In fact, in the modern sense America had no cities 
at that time. The great bulk of the people lived 
in little villages or on solitary farms. To-day nearly 
a third of the population of the United States is 
found in cities of over eight thousand inhabitants, 
and ten per cent live in the four cities of New York, 
Chicago, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia. And the rela- 
tive preponderance of the cities is steadily increas- 
ing. In Europe this proportion is yet more striking- 
To-day about three-fourths of the people of Scot- 
land are townspeople, as against one-fourth at the 
opening of the present century. In England one- 
third of the whole population is in towns of over one 
hundred thousand inhabitants, and nearly another 
third in towns of from ten thousand to one hundred 
thousand. In France, the town population is about 
a third; in Germany, fully two-fifths. And in all 
these countries as well as in every other European 
state, the population of towns and cities is increas- 
ing much more rapidly than is that of the rural 
districts. 

These simple facts are exceedingly significant. 
They show that the modern form of life is distinc- 
tively urban. And they at once explain why it is 
that the important questions relating to the admin- 
istration of cities have only very recently emerged 
into the public consciousness. But we in the United 
States have suddenly found that we are confronted 
in the management of municipal affairs with diffi-

culties which threaten our prosperity, our comfort, 
our safety, and our dignity, far more than is the 
case with any matters of national policy. The pub- 
lic debt of the United States in 1894 was $12.57 
per capita. The public debt of the city of New 
York at the same time was about $70 per capita. 
In the palmiest days of the spoils system in the civil 
service of the United States, the worst condition of 
things was purity itself in comparison with the rot- 
tenness of New York under Tweed or Croker. For 
these and many other reasons, it is getting to be a 
matter of very great importance that the various 
questions involved in the social problem which we 
call the city should be clearly understood. 

Dr. Albert Shaw has given us an exhaustive study 
of British municipalities. He sketches their devel- 
opment, especially in recent times, analyzes the 
methods and principles of the municipal code, and 
then exhibits the working of these methods by de- 
tailed accounts of typical cities Glasgow, Man- 
chester, Birmingham, London. There is a valuable 
closing chapter on metropolitan tasks and problems, 
and the appendix contains the English municipal 
code, with some other interesting material. The 
work is done very thoroughly, and the subject is 
treated with that breadth of view and fulness of 
knowledge which we have learned to expect from 
this writer. 

In studying these British cities, one is struck with 
two things: the number of services undertaken by 
the municipal authorities, and the business-like effi- 
ciency with which the public business is transacted. 
The former is quite socialistic, the latter is decid- 
edly un-American. It has been said that the test 
of the value of any system of city government is 
what it does for the people, how well it is done, and 
what it costs. Tried by these standards, the gov- 
ernment of Glasgow, for instance, shows some strik- 
ing contrasts with conditions sufficiently familiar 
here. That city has undertaken some services which 
we either leave undone or relegate to private enter- 
prise. A sanitary wash-house cleanses and disin- 
fects clothing, carpets, and the like, from any dwell- 
ing in which a case of contagious disease occurs. 
And while any such dwelling is undergoing disin- 
fection, a poor family may have quarters in a public 
lodging-house provided for that purpose. The city 
" pest-house " in our country is usually a loathsome 
place, and people are quite apt to conceal contagious 
cases in order to save the patient from the horrors, 
real or imagined, of the hospital. Glasgow, in lieu 
of a pest-house, has an estate of thirty acres, in 
which a series of pleasant cottages afford the great- 
est comfort for both patients and nurses. The ac- 
commodations are so pleasant, and so far beyond 
what could be had at home, that instead of hiding 
a case of contagion the friends are eager to give no- 
tice of it. And this way of doing things turns out 
to be good policy. Epidemics in Glasgow are easily 
kept under control. The city also provides com- 
modious public baths, which charge a nominal 



fee. The average number of bathers is fifteen 
hundred a day, and the results to the public health 
and comfort can easily be conjectured. Public 
wash-houses enable a woman for two pence an 
hour to use the latest and most effective appliances, 
and within that time easily to complete a family 
washing. The gas supply and the water supply both 
belong to the city. The price of gas has been grad- 
ually reduced from $1.14, the price charged prior to 
the transfer to the city, to the present rate of sixty 
cents per thousand feet. And at the same time the 
works have been extended and improved, and an 
ample sinking-fund provided which will pay off the 
debt incurred in the purchase when it falls due. 
The street railways are owned and operated by the 
city. Originally, the city built the lines and leased 
their use to a private company for a series of years, 
on terms exceedingly favorable to the public. When 
the lease expired, in 1894, the city decided there- 
after to operate the lines on its own account. It has 
been able, in doing this, to provide a rate of fares 
of one cent per half-mile in the crowded part of the 
city, with longer runs for two cents ; and at the 
same time to reduce materially the hours of em- 
ployees. These and other public undertakings in 
Glasgow Mr. Shaw thinks are managed with great 
economy and efficiency. 

The first question, perhaps, which occurs to an 
American is : Cannot the same things be done here ? 
But the answer will suggest itself quite as promptly : 
No, it is utterly out of the question. To enlarge 
the services of our American municipality to take 
on the gas supply, to run the street-car system as 
the property of the city would merely mean so 
many more " jobs " for political adventurers. We 
are sufficiently familiar now with a police force 
which is run for the benefit of ward heelers and 
thugs. Imagine Tammany methods applied to the 
selection of street-car conductors ! Imagine " fine 
work " at the primaries rewarded with a place as 
motorman on a grip-car ! In short, the question 
whether it is or is not good policy for the commun- 
ity to undertake further duties for the general wel- 
fare, is simply not a question at all under existing 
conditions. It is a waste of time to discuss it. 
When we have learned how to get our present mu- 
nicipal machinery out of the hands of the corrupt 
gang who have so deeply disgraced the American 
name in every one of our leading cities, then, and 
not until then, will be time to think of other uses 
for the machinery. 

Another striking contrast which Mr. Shaw's pages 
suggest is the relative economy and efficiency of the 
English system as compared with the enormous 
waste and poor results in America. Is republican- 
ism a failure? Are Americans lacking in political 
ability? Has the greed for wealth absorbed our 
public spirit? We shall hardly answer these ques- 
tions in the affirmative. The triumphs of the repub- 
lic in securing and maintaining public order have 
been too great for us to admit that the nation which

THE DIAL

created the Federal Constitution, which has been 
made stronger by rebellion and richer in spite of the 
vast destruction of property caused by war and eman- 
cipation, is not able to grapple with almost any diffi- 
culties. Democracy, we have learned, sometimes 
is very sluggish at getting an idea into its head ; 
but when the idea once gets there it never gets out. 
We shall get the municipal idea in time. 

The form of government of British cities is rad- 
ically different from that to which the present ten- 
dency in this country is giving shape. In Great 
Britain the mayor is little more than a figure-head. 
All power is wielded by an elective council. Here, 
experience leads us to place no expei'ience whatever 
in a city council, but to vest enormous power, to- 
gether with full responsibility, in the mayor. Cur- 
iously enough, our democracy is leading to a consti- 
tutional Caesarism in city affairs. Mr. Shaw thinks 
that we might with profit adopt the European 
method. Perhaps so. But it would be squarely 
against the current of our political experience and 
our political thinking. 

We set out a hundred years ago with a buoyant 
belief in the entire sufficiency of a representative 
legislature. We had been able to rid ourselves of 
a king, and of his detestable myrmidons, the col- 
onial governors. We were free. And with our 
Congress and our legislature, we expected to be 
happy. But the student of American institutions is 
confronted with no more obtrusive fact than the steady 
growth of distrust in our legislative bodies. Power 
after power has been shorn from them. It has 
been learned that they are repositories of neither 
wisdom nor integrity. And the people have learned, 
after all, to depend on the executive for protection. 
Accordingly the governors of our states have been 
more and more entrusted with checks on the legis- 
lative branch. And in like manner the common 
councils of our cities have had their functions in 
large part transferred to the mayor. In Philadel- 
phia, in Brooklyn, in New York, responsibility has 
been centred in the executive. And now the same 
thing, already largely embodied in the general stat- 
ute of Illinois, is proposed to be carried to its log- 
ical end in Chicago. If the bill of the Civic Fed- 
eration becomes law, the common council will be- 
come an innocuous body. 

The reason for this peculiar tendency in our 
American democracy is plain enough. For corrupt 
or incompetent action by the city council, it is im- 
practicable to decide whom to hold accountable. 
One might as well try to tip over a sand hill with 
a pistol bullet. But if the mayor has the power to 
make things right, and things are wrong, everybody 
knows who is at fault. 

There is another ground for considering the 
American plan as, on the whole, better than the 
English. City government is mainly administrative 
business, and for administration, a single head is 
much better than many heads. It is just as in the 
management of an army. One poor general, in- 



vested with the supreme command, is much more 
likely to succeed than several good officers with co- 
ordinate authority. Everybody's business is no- 
body's business. Two heads may be better than 
one for deliberation ; they are much worse than one 
for action. English democracy is at just about the 
point we had reached a hundred years ago. Wait 
until in England the slums vote and " the machine " 
becomes a power. Committees, councils, and om- 
nipotent parliaments will be less in favor then. Of 
course, municipal reform cannot be secured by tink- 
ering with charters. The personal equation can 
never be disregarded. The main question must al- 
ways be, how to secure for the public service men 
of high character. But that is hopeless, for any 
length of time while the spoils system is allowed to 
remain, while it is possible for an irresponsible 
many-headed body like a city council to bestow 
franchises and contracts, and while membership in 
such a body consumes a large amount of time. 
There should be two classes of city officials ex- 
perts, who give their whole time to their public du- 
ties, who have safe tenure and are well paid ; and 
overseers, who are periodically elected, have no sal- 
ary, are not obliged to take much time from their 
business, who can advise and can determine only 
general matters of policy. 

We have but scant space left for the other books 
in our group. Mr. Conkling's volume on " City 
Government in the United States " is a very con- 
venient manual of the structure of American city 
governments. He analyzes the functions of a mu- 
nicipality, and shows how our principal cities deal 
with them. For a condensed view of these methods, 
nothing better can be found. A comparison of the 
British and American systems can readily be made 
in the pages of these two books. 

Dr. Parkhurst's story of the recent fight with 
Tammany is a discouraging thing not because it 
is not the record of success, but because it shows 
too plainly how completely the people allow their 
affairs to fall into the hands of scoundrels. It is a 
quarter of a century since the Tweed gang was 
driven from New York. How long will it be be- 
fore the Parkhurst crusade will have to be re- 
peated? Is the party "boss" the vital feature of 
our public life? So Mr. Champernowne, in his 
trenchant essay on "The Boss," implies. The work 
is a satire, in the manner of Machiavelli's "Prince" 
very crisp and droll. And there can be no man- 
ner of doubt that it is the perfect organization and 
ready obedience of Tammany Hall that made Tweed 
and Croker so potent for evil. But perhaps we can 
learn something from Tammany. Definite and 
permanent organization for honest municipal pur- 
poses, quite irrespective of high tariff or free silver, 
may do as much to secure a real reform as it has 
done to fill the pockets of blackmailers and swind- 
ling contractors.

RECENT ENGLISH POETRY.* 



The opening piece in Mr. Watson's " Odes and 
Other Poems " is a personal tribute to Mr. R. H. 
Hutton, and ends with this stanza : 

" And not uncrowned with honours ran 
My days, and not without a boast shall end ! 
For I was Shakespeare's countryman ; 
And wert thou not my friend ? " 

" The Spectator " has subsequently expressed its 
editorial opinion that Mr. Watson is the greatest 
of English poets now living. This bit of log-roll- 
ing offers a very neat illustration of a familiar pas- 
sage in the Book of Koheleth (XI., 1). If it were 
not for this and other similarly preposterous opin- 
ions of the poet's ill-advised admirers, the critic 
might be spared the unpleasant task of pointing 
out the defects of Mr. Watson's verse, and be con- 
tent with dwelling upon its many admirable quali- 
ties. But the fact that any considerable number of 
persons are capable of speaking and writing with 
" The Spectator's " utter lack of the sense of per- 
spective, the fact that Mr. Watson has been seri- 
ously put forward as a possible successor to the 
laurel-wreath of. Tennyson, although such men as 
Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William Morris are still 
alive, compels a very pointed direction of the atten- 
tion to his shortcomings first of all, to the intol- 
erable self-consciousness that pervades a large part 
of his verse, then to the trivial and commonplace char- 
acter of much of his material, to the frequent met- 
rical blemishes, and to the elephantine gambolling 
which he sometimes mistakes for playfulness. All 
of these matters are illustrated in the volume before 
us ; the self-consciousness in a dozen places, the 
triviality in almost as many, the rhythmical stum- 
bling in such a hexameter as 
"For had I not dwelt where Nature but prattled familiar 



and the ungraceful capering in "A Study in Con- 
trasts." Having reluctantly said this much of Mr. 
Watson's failures, we turn with the more pleasure 
to the pages in which he appears as his nobler and 
better self, to the pages in which patriotism in- 
spires this fine invocation to the Power that shapes 
the destinies of empires : 

" Purge and renew this England, once so fair, 
When Arthur's Knights were armed with nobleness, 
Or Alfred's wisdom poised the sacred scales ;

Yea, and in later times, when Liberty, 

Her crowned and crosiered enemies combating, 

Stood proudlier 'stablished by a false King's fall, 

Mighty from Milton's pen and Cromwell's sword, 

Terribly beauteous, passionately just, 

Seared with hell's hate, and in her scars divine," 

or to the page that contains this impressive warn- 
ing for those who would bring about, through vio- 
lence, a new and fairer birth of things : 

"A moment's fantasy, the vision came 

Of Europe dipped in fiery death, and so 
Mounting reborn, with vestal limbs aglow, 

Splendid and fragrant from her bath of flame. 

It fleeted : and a phantom without name, 

Sightless, dismembered, terrible, said : ' Lo, 
/ am that ravished Europe men shall know 

After the morn of blood and night of shame.' " 

It would be difficult to quarrel with a book that 
is so exquisite a piece of mechanical workmanship 
as Mr. Gosse's new volume, and the contents give 
no occasion for such a mishap. Mr. Gosse is, like 
Mr. Watson, only a minor poet, but his talent is as 
evident as its nurture has been delicate. Starting 
upon his poetical path as an imitator of Mr. Swin- 
burne, he has gradually found a voice for himself, 
and the transition from "On Viol and Flute" to 
"In Russet and Silver" has been a passage from 
crudity to mellowness, from exuberance to restraint. 

" Life, that, when youth was hot and bold, 
Leaped up in scarlet and in gold, 
Now walks, by graver hopes possessed, 
In russet and in silver dressed." 

There is a slight element of pose in the affectation 
of advancing years so frequently recurrent in this 
sheaf of songs for the author is not so very aged, 
after all and the mine dimittis strain does not fit 
very well with the abundant vitality we know him 
still to possess. But assuming, for the nonce, the 
standpoint which we cannot help thinking to have 
been unduly anticipated, we must say that Mr. Gosse 
sings with exceptional grace of the moods and mem- 
ories of old age. 

" In youth our fiery lips were fed 

With fruit in lavish waste ; 
We watch it now hung o'er our head, 
And, now, at length can taste. 

" The boisterous pleasures of the boy 

Their own deep rapture steal ; 
I ask no longer to enjoy, 
But ah ! to muse and feel." 

Such charming discourse de senectute might be mul- 
tiplied indefinitely from these pages, but we must 
turn to the more objective aspects of the volume. 
Sympathy for others, particularly for those " in dis- 
grace with fortune and men's eyes," is always a mark 
of the true poet, and we find it in plentiful measure 
here. How deep is this note in such a poem as 
" Neurasthsenia," with its compassionate sense of 
the way in which some hapless lives are warped 
from the very hour of birth. 

" Curs'd from the cradle and awry they come, 

Masking their torment from a world at ease ; 
On eyes of dark entreaty, vague and dumb, 
They bear the stigma of their souls' disease.

41 Bewildered by the shadowy ban of birth, 

They learn that they are not as others are, 
Till some go mad, and some sink, prone to earth, 
And some push stumbling on without a star ; 

" And some, of sterner mould, set hard their hearts, 

To act the dreadful comedy of life, 
And wearily grow perfect in their parts ; 
But all are wretched and their years are strife." 

The figures of the flaming torch handed on from 
runner to runner, and of the sacred flame kept 
alight by successive ministrants, have always been 
favorite symbols with the poets who have sought to 
sing of the sacredness of their art. Mr. Gosse's 
"Alere Flammam " is the latest of a long line of lyrics 
upon these themes, and by no means the least beau- 
tiful. We quote the last two of the four stanzas: 

" Ah ! so, untouched by windy roar 

Of public issues loud and long, 
The Poet holds the sacred door, 

And guards the glowing coal of song ; 
Not his to grasp at praise or blame, 

Red gold, or crown beneath the sun, 
His only pride to tend the flame 

That Homer and that Virgil won, 
Retain the rite, preserve the act, 
And pass the worship on intact. 

" Before the shrine at last he falls ; 

The crowd rush in, a chattering band ; 
But, ere he fades in death, he calls 

Another priest to ward the brand ; 
He, with a gesture of disdain, 

Flings back the ringing brazen gate, 
Reproves, repressing, the profane, 

And feeds the flame in primal state ; 
Content to toil and fade in turn 
If still the sacred embers burn." 

The section of "Memorial Verses" offers some of 
the best recent examples of this class of work. "In 
Poet's Corner," for example, gives us this tribute to 
Tennyson : 

" Thanks for the music that through thirty years 

Quicken'd my pulse to tears, 
The eye that colour' d nature, the wise hand, 

The brain that nobly plann'd ; 
Thanks for the anguish of the perfect phrase, 

Tingling the blood ablaze ! 
Organ of God, with multitudinous swell 
Of various tone, farewell ! " 

Even more beautiful are the tributes to Rossetti, 
Banville, and Leconte de Lisle. As for " Beatrice," 
it is a gem of purest ray serene. 

" Thro' Dante's hands, in dreamy vigil clasp'd 

A pale green bud shot skyward from the sod ; 
He bowed and sighed ; then laid the prize he grasp'd, 
A folded lily, at the feet of God. 

" There she has slowly open'd, age by age, 

And grown a star to light Man's heart to heaven ; 
Her perfume his divinest heritage, 
Her love the noblest gift God's self hath given." 

A volume of such high average excellence as this 
tempts to quotation, but space fails for more than 
has been given. We must, however, mention the 
translations from the Swedish of Rosenhare, Wex- 
ionius, and Stagnelius, and from the Dutch of 
Hooft and Vondel. The volume closes with " The 



Masque of Painters," performed in 1885, and richly 
deserving of preservation in this collection. 

Mr. John Davidson's "Ballads and Songs," with 
their daring originality and their turbulent energy, 
present the greatest possible contrast to the finished 
and academic verse of .Mr. Gosse. Of the half- 
do/en ballads grouped together in the forefront of 
the volume it is impossible to give any adequate 
notion by means of extracts. They are novel in 
conception, and their imagery is as striking as any 
that even Mr. Kipling has conceived. We are not 
quite sure that we understand them, but of their 
curious and unexpected impressiveness there can be 
no doubt. We must for the present be content to 
represent the author by a poem more nearly con- 
ventional than the intensely dramatic ballads, yet a 
poem that bears no less the sign and seal of his 
marked individuality. It is a set of three stanzas 
on " London." 

" Athwart the sky a lowly sigh 

From west to east the sweet wind carried ; 

The sun stood still on Primrose Hill ; 
His light in all the city tarried : 

The clouds on viewless columns bloomed 

Like smouldering lilies unconsumed. 

"Oh sweetheart, see ! how shadowy, 

Of some occult magician's rearing 
Or swung in space of heaven's grace 

Dissolving, dimly reappearing, 
Afloat upon ethereal tides 
St. Paul's above the city rides ! 

" A rumour broke through the thin smoke 
Enwreathing abbey, tower, and palace, 

The parks, the squares, the thoroughfares, 
The million-peopled lanes and alleys, 

An ever-muttering prisoned storm, 

The heart of London beating warm." 

It would be both interesting and instructive to com- 
pare these verses with those upon the same theme 
recently given us by Mr. Le Gallienne and Mr. W. 
E. Henley. 

" A Book of Song," by Mr. Julian Sturgis, in- 
cludes verses of many years, written rather for per- 
sonal satisfaction than in view of public applause. 
But their quality is so good, in spite of their unpre- 
tentiousness, that we are not willing to accept, with- 
out a word of commendation, the author's invita- 
tion " to remark that all alike are childish, and so 
pass on to a more worthy prey." " Whence? " is a 
good example of Mr. Sturgis's work. 

" Will he come to us out of the West 

With hair all blowing free ? 
Will he come, the last and best, 
Over the flowing sea, 
Prophet of days to be ? 

" Aye, he will come ; the unseen choir 

Attend his steps with song, 
And on his breast a deep-toned lyre, 
And on his lips a word like fire 
To burn the ancient wrong. 

" Bay-crowned and goodlier than a king, 

With voice both strong and sweet 
The song of ^freedom he will sing, 
And I from out the crowd shall fling 
My rose-wreath at his feet."

We wish, indeed, that Mr. Sturgis had heen less 
exclusive in selecting the pieces for this volume. 
We are sure that some of the songs from his under- 
graduate days, " of a complexion sad as night," 
would have been equally acceptable with these now 
given, " for in those singing days of the reed voice 
'twixt man and boy the subtlest, saddest pleasure 
may be drawn from converse now and then with 
our good comrade Melancholy. Together we take 
the road, and in these mornings of our wayfaring 
a face once seen in the passing crowd, or the mere 
amorous air of fleeting Spring, may set us throbbing 
with a song of love." 

An unpretentious and exquisite talent, not unlike 
that of the author just named, is displayed by Mr. 
Auberon Herbert in his " Windfall and Water- 
drift." Here are nearly two hundred lyrics few 
of them exceeding eight lines all marked by refine- 
ment and delicate susceptibility. For example: 

" The sea is at rest for the storms are o'er 

Just touched with the hand of night ; 
And a line of shadow creeps to the shore, 
Then flashes in silver light, 

" Like a note that stoops in its flight, and droops, 

And clings for a while to the ground, 
Then trembles, and wakes from its trance, and breaks 
Into passion and glory of sound." 

It is a welcome surprise to find a poet in the apos- 
tle of voluntary taxation. 

We will close these notes upon a six months' 
sheaf of English poetry with a word for Mr. Will- 
iam Akerman's blank-verse tragedy, " The Cross 
of Sorrow." This poem is a dramatization, after 
the Elizabethan model, of " Le Mariage de Ven- 
geance " in Le Sage's " Gil Bias." The author has 
caught no little of the Elizabethan trick of diction, 
as the following passage, one of the best in the play, 
will show: 

" There are men still live whose lives are like the light 
That flashes from the topmost lighthouse tower, 
And comes the sea of sorrow up in arms 
It cannot shake the rock, their soul's foundation. 
With calm eyes looking out into the night, 
Watching the world's wild tempest whistling by, 
They light the lamp that hails the mariner 
Who, struggling on with his disabled barque 
Through mist and tempest findeth a new-born hope, 
And steers his fragile vessel home again 
Into a place of safety. Lonely the heights 
That make their dwelling, yet their solitude 
Is mightier than the state that hems about 
The palaces of kings and emperors ; 
And when the crack of doom falls out of Heaven, 
When the last tempest overtopples them, 
The world weeps tears of immortal sorrow 
For the light that shines no more ! " 

The structure of Mr. Akerman's drama was made 
for him, so to speak, by Le Sage, but considerable 
skill is displayed in the arrangement of scenes, and 
the work is one to read with pleasure. The Neo- 
Elizabethan drama is not a form of composition 
likely in our time to attract many readers, but, as 
the author observes, " the fashion of to-day is not 
necessarily the fashion of to-morrow," and every 



poet should be more concerned to find and work in 
his own element than to accept the trammels of 
some other merely because that other element hap- 
pens to be in vogue. 

Miss May Kendall is one of the most charming 
among contemporary writers of light verse ; and her 
new volume, while possibly not quite equal in exe- 
cution to her "Dreams to Sell," is full of pleasing 
and pathetic fancies. "A Fossil" offers a good ex- 
ample of her delicate touch. 

" He had his Thirty-nine Articles, 

And his Nicene Creed, 
And his Athanasian. Nothing else 

He appeared to need. 
He looked like a walking dogma, pent 

Neath a shovel brim ; 
If he never knew what the dogma meant, 

' Twas small blame to him. 

" He did not hazard a single guess, 

That might lead to twain, 
Whose answers never would coalesce 

In a peaceful brain ! 
He seemed pure fossil : yet I protest 

That across the aisle 
I one day saw him of life possessed 

For a little while ! 

" 'And streams in the desert,' sang the choir. 

What a strange surmise 
Just then awoke, like a smouldering fire, 

In his weary eyes ! 
That never came from the Nicene Creed 

'Twas a dream, I know, 
Of some fair day when he lived indeed, 

In the long ago ! " 

There is a suggestion of the whimsical in the piece 
just quoted, although the main purport is serious 
enough. And the whimsical is the element in which 
Miss Kendall does her most characteristic work, as 
might be amply illustrated, had we the needed space. 
" The Fatal Advertisements," for example, is as de- 
licious a bit of semi-scientific whimsicality as is often 
seen. And the scientific doctrine of the dissipation 
of energy is very neatly set forth in " Ether Insatia- 
ble," of which poem we may reproduce two out of 
four stanzas : 

" There is not a hushed malediction, 

There is not a smile or a sigh, 
But aids in dispersing, by friction, 

The cosmical heat in the sky ; 
And whether a star falls, or whether 

A heart breaks for stars and for men 
Their labour is all for the ether 

That renders back nothing again. 

"And we, howsoever we hated 

And feared, or made love, or believed, 
For all the opinions we stated, 

The woes and the wars we achieved, 
We, too, shall lie idle together, 

In very uncritical case 
And no one will win but the ether, 

That fills circumambient space ! " 

That the writer can, if she chooses, be entirely se- 
rious, is witnessed by the group of graceful pieces 
that close the volume, and one of which, " Forgive- 
ness," shall close our selections.

' Life is not utterly amiss. 

'Twould be ungracious to despair, 
I fancy, on a day like this, 

In such a free, soft air, 
One ceases to climb fast. Ah well ! 

There's a spring day before, my dear 
I'll show you where the asphodel 
Grew on the moor last year. 

' We bear no proud victorious sheaf, 

We have no ' Harvest Home ' to raise 
And yet perhaps a withered leaf 

May sometimes give God praise, 
As through its failing being run 

Old thrills of earth and wind and rain, 
Before it passes to be one 

With wind and earth again. 

And yet, not utterly in vain 

We bore the burden and the heat, 
We shared the sacrament of pain 

Altar where all men meet ! 
And now awhile have peace, nor grieve, 

Here in the moorland's joyous breath 
Until our erring souls receive 

The sacrament of Death ! "

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The judicious reader of Miss Rep- 
Peer's In the Dozy Hours " (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co.) will, we believe, 
be just a little disappointed, and that on the whole 
very pleasantly. Her latest volume of essays does 
not lack the cleverness and distinction which marked 
' Essays in Idleness," for instance, but there is one 
thing about this book which was not so obvious in 
that. Some may, perhaps, regret that Miss Rep- 
plier thinks fit to give her work a practical turn. 
It would certainly be rather sad if this pleasing 
essayist should ever, by any chance, lose herself in 
the turbulent chaos of nowaday life, so far as to 
try to settle burning questions and timely problems, 
or to handle current topics or present phases of 
thought. These are good things for some people to 
write about, but probably Miss Repplier does well 
to give them a wide berth. Still, it is a pity to re- 
main entirely apart from what really interests a 
good many people, and it is with great pleasure, 
therefore, that we perceive in this book not a little 
good common-sense on some matters of contem- 
porary moment which are too often engrossed by 
persons somewhat lacking in that excellent quality. 
The touch is light, of course, and there is not a lit- 
tle humor ; but there is good sense at bottom. There 
are many worthy people at the present day who 
might gain great advantage from a perusal of this 
work. The essay on " Lectures " would be a good 
preface to every University Extension course. That 
on " Opinions " should lie within easy reach of those 
misguided multitudes that read the newspapers for 
anything but news. " Pastels " might well be learned 
by heart (it is short) by very many members of 
literary societies, provided they could apply it to 
other matters, germane to the subject. We our- 



selves feel that "Aut Caesar, aut Nihil " and "A 
Curious Contention " contain many words of wis- 
dom ; but, being masculine, we may be prejudiced. 
" In the Dozy Hours," despite its misleading title, 
seems to indicate a real accession to the saving 
remnant which still maintains the good cause against 
the armies of folly. It is a pleasure to add that, 
beside the contributions above noted, there is much 
in the volume which will probably serve no good 
purpose whatever, except that of giving enjoyment. 
Also there are some interesting details about Agrip- 
pina's Kitten, whose name is Nero. 



Side glimpses of 
the Colonial 

Cavalier. 



Alon g wi ^ h the current of books on 
the Colonial Puritan, comes a timely 

Qne by Migg Mau( j WIlder Qoodwin 

on "The Colonial Cavalier" (Lovell, Coryell, & 
Co.). More picturesque, if less exemplary, than 
his mortified brethren to the north of him, and an 
element of weight and permanence in the compo- 
sition of Anglo-American character, the "Cava- 
lier " deserves serious and honest portrayal ; and 
such, within the modest scope and space-limits of 
her little book, the author has tried to give him. 
She has scanned the authorities with care, and with 
a commendable view of digesting her gleanings 
therefrom into a literary product of her own ; hence 
her book is no mere work of scissors and paste-pot. 
Miss Goodwin has not drawn her hero from his 
too-florid image in the glass of Southern tradition 
as a fancied fine gentleman all lace and ruffles, 
powder and sword-knot, who drank, swaggered, and 
gambled, and comported himself generally on his 
James River " estate " and at Williamsburg much 
as his prototype had done at Whitehall and St 
James's. There was undoubtedly in the horse jock- 
eying, rough-riding, free-handed Virginia tobacco- 
farmer, or squirelet, with his fine manners and his 
Tory traditions, some touch of the qualities with 
which the imagination of his descendants has gilded 
him. His abundant leisure, procured him by the 
abundant toil of his sable " retainers," allowed him 
to cultivate graces to which the rugged and labo- 
rious New Englander was long perforce a stranger. 
But there was a hint of pinchbeck about it all. 
Says John Randolph : " Nowhere could be found a 
school of more genial and simple courtesy than that 
which produced the great men and women of Vir- 
ginia, but it had its dangers and affectations ; it 
was often provincial and sometimes absurd." To 
our notion, Virginia " chivalry " never shone so 
genuinely as in the dark days when the stress of 
the Civil War had stripped away its tinsel. Rising 
with his reverses, the " Cavalier " showed himself 
a true cavalier. Take, for example, worthy, im- 
poverished Colonel Dabney, who, learning (from 
some strange source) that General Sherman pro- 
posed to " bring every Southern woman to the wash- 
tub," gallantly responded: "He shall never bring 
my daughters to the wash-tub ; / will do the wash- 
ing myself! " and for two years he suited action 
to word, scrubbing and mangling, starching and

ironing, to the wonder of Fauquier County. Clio, 
in celebrating the sons of the Old Dominion, 
should not pass over Colonel Dabney. Miss Good- 
win's book is well written, and with some humor ; 
and it liberally fulfils the author's promise to " open 
a side-door, through which we may, perchance, gain 
a sense of fire-side intimacy with 'The Colonial 
Cavalier.' " 



Conversations on Sir Edward Strachey's "Talk at a 
Literature and Country House " (Houghton, Mifflin 
other matters. & CQ ) holdg rather ft p l easant p l ace 

among the Dialogues which are now somewhat the 
fashion. Mr. James's dialogues are clever, of course, 
but some have found it wearisome to be always guess- 
ing at the topic under discussion. Vernon Lee's are 
full of quickening thought, but the portentously long 
sentences are a sore trial now and then. Oscar 
Wilde's are delightful, but one can't go on reading 
them forever, even though they be preposterous. 
The conversations between Foster and the Squire 
make a refreshing patch of neutral tint in all this 
brilliancy and pyrotechnic. Not at all modern are 
these talks ; in fact, their charm lies largely in their 
being old-fashioned. An old English country house 
with pictures and traditions, and an old English 
country Squire with curious and cultivated interests, 
and a person named Foster who asks a great many 
questions, out of these materials Sir Edward Strachey 
has made his dialogues, some of which, at least, are 
already known to American readers through " The 
Atlantic Monthly." The dialogue is a fascinating 
form ; it has great dangers, but it offers many op- 
portunities. Local color and character, these give 
an interest, an atmosphere, to the Squire's little crit- 
ical disquisitions on widely differing subjects, from 
the Cuneiform Inscriptions down to English Politics, 
from Sa'di and Hafiz down to Tennyson and Mau- 
rice ; not exciting nor yet brilliant, not up to date in 
some respects, but interesting in many ways, and, 
on the whole, very good reading. A little conven- 
tional are they, one may urge, as dialogues. Foster 
is too much like the Question in a scientific quiz- 
book. But then, that is rather the way that one 
talks to old gentlemen like the Squire. The object is 
to get them to talk back ; so one asks questions. 
We should most of us be lucky if our questions were 
always answered with as much good sense and fine 
taste as were Foster's. 



Mrs. Fields's 
"Shelf of 
Old Books." 



Very pleasant reading, and delight- 
ful to the eye withal, is the fine vol- 
ume by Mrs. James T. Fields en- 
titled "A Shelf of Old Books" (Scribner). The 
books in point are certain notable volumes that came 
into the possession of Mr. Fields from time to time 
by gift or purchase. Each of these volumes, or 
groups of volumes, has for Mrs. Fields its special 
memories and associations, touching either author 
or giver; and these furnish the motif and ground- 
work of the three papers that form the contents of 
her book. The first paper, on Leigh Hunt, con- 



tains some good talk about Hunt, Shelley, Keats, 
Procter, and their circle ; the second, on Edinburgh, 
introduces Scott, Ramsay, " Kit North," Dr. John 
Brown, De Quincey, and other cultivators of liter- 
ature on a little oatmeal and much glenlivat, in 
Edina's palmy days ; the third paper, " From Mil- 
ton to Thackeray," is a medley of literary chat and 
anecdote, much in the vein of Thackeray's gifted 
daughter, Mrs. Ritchie. A prime favorite with the 
writer was Leigh Hunt, whom she knew personally,, 
and whose library, containing some precious speci- 
mens, finally came into Mr. Fields's possession. Mrs. 
Fields tells many pleasant stories of Hunt, which 
serve to offset some not pleasant ones of him afloat. 
A charming touch is that as to his love of flowers 
how in his prison days he papered the walls of 
his cell with a trellis of painted roses, and had plants 
set in the dismal windows like " Tim Linkinwa- 
ter's " famous mignonette. Among Mr. Fields's 
treasures was a copy of " Don Juan " that Byron 
himself once corrected and sent to Murray to be 
used in reprinting the poem. On a fly-leaf stands 
the following sarcastic note to the printer, penned 
by his lordship :**... The Authour repeats (a& 
before) that the former impressions (from whatever 
cause) are full of errours. And he further adds 
that he doth kindly trust with all due deference 
to those superior persons the publisher and printer 
that they will in future less misspell misplace 
mistake and mis-every thing, the humbled MSS. 
of their humble servant." This and other interest- 
ing notes and letters are given in fac-simile in the 
present volume. There are also a number of well- 
executed portraits and other illustrations, complet- 
ing and enriching the ensemble of a very attractive 
book.

go hard were there not a tew or con- 
siderable merit among them all. Indeed, one can 
hardly look over the contents of one of these star- 
ing octavos, without a dim sense of wonder that the 
editors should have unearthed so many acceptable 
writers and artists hitherto unknown to the public, 
for familiar names are by no means the rule. The 
October issue, which is the third of the series, im- 
presses us as not quite equal to the preceding two, 
although there are some striking features. Of the 
art, Mr. Philip Broughton's " Mantegna " is by far 
the best example. Mr. Beardsley's imagination 
riots as before, but one quickly wearies of his gro- 
tesque drawings. The poetry is " below par," the 
only really fine thing being " The Ballad of a Nun," 
by Mr. John Davidson. We may say a word for 
Mr. Morton Fullerton's strong sonnet on " George 
Meredith," without accepting that perverse novelist 
as Shakespeare's only rival "in our English tongue." 
The most conspicuous piece of prose is Mr. Hubert 
Crackanthorpe's " A Study in Sentimentality," and 
the best is " The Headswoman," by Mr. Kenneth 
Grahame. Mr. Henry Harland contributes a pa-

thetic story which ranks with his most finished work. 
The January " Yellow Book," completing the first 
year of the periodical, also has a pretty sketch by 
Mr. Grahame, and a story by Mr. Harland. " Wlad- 
islaw's Advent," by Mrs. Me'nie Muriel Dowie 
Norman, is one of the more striking things in this 
volume. Two serious essays one by Mr. James 
Ashcroft Noble on Alexander Smith, and one by 
Mr. Norman Hapgood on " Stendhal " claim at- 
tention, and deserve it. The poetry includes pieces 
by Mrs. Tomson, Dr. Richard Garnett, and Mr. 
Davidson. The art is not particularly artistic, and 
-we have been most interested in two " Bodley 
Heads," being portraits of Mr. LeGallienne and Mr. 
Davidson. Messrs. Copeland & Day are the Amer- 
ican publishers. 

"The Gospel of Buddha according 
to Old Records " is the title of a 
compilation made by Dr. Paul Carus, 
and issued by the Open Court Publishing Co. It 
is a selection from the Buddhist scriptures, taken 
from the best English translations, and so arranged 
as to exhibit the life and teachings of Buddha in 
systematic and consecutive presentation. The ed- 
itor tells us that he has treated his material much 
as " the author of the Fourth Gospel used the ac- 
counts of the life of Jesus of Nazareth." In a few 
chapters, the editor appears as author ; but he as- 
sures us that these original chapters " contain noth- 
ing but ideas for which prototypes can be found 
somewhere among the traditions of Buddhism, and 
have been added as elucidations of its main princi- 
ples." The distinctive features of this book are the 
way in which the material has been arranged, and 
the valuable " Table of Reference," which refers us 
to the sources of the text, and also supplies us with 
parallelisms from the Christian Scriptures. Dr. 
Carus has done in prose very much what was done 
by Sir Edwin Arnold in the verse of his " Light of 
Asia." These popular expositions have their place 
and their value, and it is the part of pedantry to scorn 
them or to refuse them a hearing. We note at the 
same time the appearance of " A Buddhist Cate- 
chism " (Putnam), " compiled from the holy writ- 
ings of the Southern Buddhists, with explanatory 
notes for the use of Europeans." Mr. Subadra 
Bhikshu is the author of this little book, which was 
first written in German, " in the year 2438 after the 
Nirvana of the Tath^gato," and now appears in an 
English version. The catechetical form is employed 
throughout the book, and the exposition of doctrine 
is made both intelligible and attractive. 



Selected 
essays by 
Mazzini. 



A recent volume with the familiar 
Dent imprint contains a selection of 
" Essays by Joseph Mazzini" (Mac- 
rnillan), translated by Mr. Thomas Okey, and pro- 
vided with an introduction by Mr. Bolton King. A 
photogravure portrait of Mazzini faces the title-page 
of the book a good portrait, the saintlike charac- 
ter of the prophet of Italian unity reflected from the 



noble ascetic visage. Mr. King's introduction is 
mainly biographical, and recapitulates with marked 
sympathy the leading facts of that devoted life. 
The essays comprise " Interest and Principles" 
(1836), " Faith and the Future " (1835), The Pa- 
triots and the Clergy " (1835), the Programme " To 
the Italians " and the " Thoughts on the French 
Revolution of 1789" from "Roma del Popolo" 
(1871), "The Question of the Exiles" from "La 
Jeune Suisse " (1836), and a beautiful "Unpub- 
lished Letter " of consolation, addressed by Mazzini 
to a father sorrowing for the loss of his only son. 
Let it not be thought that these essays are of local 
and temporary interest only. They are far more 
than that, as are nearly all of the writings of their 
author. As long as noble ideals of patriotism, or 
of conduct in the other aspects of life, shall be cher- 
ished among men, the message of that great soul 
will have both meaning and force. As the name of 
the historical Mazzini recedes farther and farther 
into the past, his fame grows brighter and brighter. 
In the words of his most eloquent panegyrist: 

" Life and the clouds are vanished : hate and fear 

Have had their span 
Of time to hurt, and are not : he is here, 
The sunlike man." 

It is with real gratitude that we welcome a volume 
that cannot fail to widen the circle of those to whom 
Mazzini's message makes its appeal. 

" Blank Verse," by John Addington 
Symonds (imported by Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons), is a reprint of three 
essays which have been already published as an ap- 
pendix to a previous work. It is excellent to have 
them in a volume by themselves, for though rather 
slight, and by no means digested into a single treat- 
ise, they have in them a good deal that is very use- 
ful to the student of the technique of poetry. The 
first essay is general in character, the second is a 
review of English blank verse from Surrey to Ten- 
nyson, and the third is on Milton's blank verse. 
The study is chiefly of Rhythm ; and here, though 
we nowhere have a full and accurate statement of 
the principles at bottom, we do get a good deal 
which suggests the right idea the necessity of sub- 
ordinating the mere prosody to a consideration of 
the meaning which Professor Corson worked out 
so successfully in the treatment of blank verse in 
his " Primer of English Verse." Mr. Symonds's re- 
marks on Quantity and Rhythm (p. 10), and on 
Quantity in Latin and English (p. 4) , are good. When 
he says of " Hyperion " that the decasyllabic beat 
maintains an uninterrupted undercurrent of regu- 
lar pulsation" (p. 64), he gets closest to the basis 
of future studies in blank verse. The present stu- 
dent of poetic art has the advantage of Mr. Sy- 
monds, in recent work on the psychic effects of 
rhythm in general. But Mr. Symonds's book, though 
written some time ago, has much that seems to show 
that he had divined, as it were, a good deal as to 
the nature of rhythm in poetry.

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



A new hutory In " The History of the English Lan- 
oj the English guage " (Macmillan), Professor Ql- 
language. j ver ]? arrar Emerson has produced 

a book that admirably serves the twofold purpose 
claimed for it in the preface as being " designed 
for college classes and for teachers of English." 
The treatment throughout is wholly scientific, and 
the best and latest authorities have been carefully 
consulted. What immediately attracts attention is 
the comparatively large space devoted to phonet- 
ics, for which, however, few readers will prob- 
ably quarrel with the author. The stand taken on 
the question of the influence of the Norman Con- 
quest on the language differs considerably from the 
popular conception, regarding it as incidental rather 
than revolutionary. In this discussion, as in sev- 
eral others of an historical character, admirable use 
is made of the results obtained by Stubbs and Free- 
man. The statement, in paragraph 30, that " this 
twofold declension [of the adjective] has been lost 
in the later development of the English, as in the 
other Teutonic tongues except High German," is 
too broad, as the same distinction is still kept up in 
the modern Scandinavian languages. An ingenious 
and useful feature of the index is the distinguishing 
between subjects and words used as examples, by 
the use of capitals and small letters respectively. 

The second series of Mr. James's 
% r dr J aL. "Theatricals" (Harper) contains 

two plays not very unlike those in 
the first series, which was noticed in THE DIAL for 
Sept. 1. These are rather the more interesting on 
the whole, although it appears that, like their pre- 
decessors, they were written for performances which 
never came off. One is tempted to wonder whether, 
if they had been given in public, they would have 
met with as striking success as that attending the 
production of Mr. James's recent play at the thea- 
tre of his patron saint. The volume is made more 
interesting by a few pages of comment. This is 
really quite amusing, especially Mr. James's char- 
acterization of himself as "the perverted man of 
letters freshly trying his hand at an art [in] which 
... he has if possible even more to unlearn than 
to learn." It is rather mean to be sniffy about any- 
thing by Mr. James, but one gets a bit irritated that 
when he can write such captivating things he should 
write such stupid ones. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Volumes III., IV., and V. of Thiers's " History of 
the French Revolution " (Lippincott) , in Mr. Frederick 
Shoberl's translation, are now published, and complete 
what is likely to remain the standard library edition of 
this work, as far as English readers are concerned. The 
fifth volume is provided with a good index, and the en- 
tire work is illustrated with more than forty fine steel 
engravings. We congratulate the publishers on their 
enterprise in producing this work, and the companion 
work on the Consulate and Empire. 



The late W. Robertson Smith's " Lectures on the Re- 
ligion of the Semites " (Macmillan) were delivered at 
Aberdeen in three successive courses, from 1888 to 
1891, by invitation of the Burnett Fund trustees. Only 
the first of the three series was published, as the failing 
health of the author checked his activities. This first 
series, having for a sub-title " The Fundamental Insti- 
tutions," appeared in 1889. A new edition of these lec- 
tures now appears, edited by a friend to whom the au- 
thor entrusted the task, and whom he supplied with a 
manuscript volume of additional materials for incorpor- 
ation within the work. The new edition thus differs 
materially from the earlier one, and represents, in all es- 
sential respects, the ripened and final opinions of the great 
scholar whose loss we mourned a few months ago. It 
is much to be hoped that arrangements may be made 
for publication of the two other series of lectures. 

" Commitment, Detention, Care, and Treatment of 
the Insane " and " Care and Training of the Feeble- 
Minded " are the titles of two collections of papers 
bound in one volume, and bearing the imprint of the 
Johns Hopkins Press. Both collections are reports of 
proceedings at the Congress of Charities, Correction, 
and Philanthropy, held at Chicago in 1893. The former 
report has been edited by Drs. G. Alder Blumer and H. 
B. Richardson, and the latter by Dr. George H. Knight. 

Volume XLI. of the " Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy " (Macmillan) extends from Nichols to O'Dugan. 
The latter worthy, whose Christian name was John, was 
an Irish poet of the fourteenth century, and seems to 
have left a numerous literary posterity. Daniel O'Cou- 
nell gets the longest biography in the present volume, 
and Titus Gates comes next. The volume is rich in 
memoirs of the families of Nichols, Norris, North, 
O'Brien, O'Connor, and O'Donnell, and has, on the 
whole, a marked Celtic flavor. 

In " The World's Largest Libraries " (Young), a col- 
lege commencement address delivered last June, General 
James Grant Wilson tells us how, during a recent Eu- 
ropean sojourn, he made a point of examining many 
famous collections of books, and saw, in the course of 
his wanderings, no less than thirty-five millions of vol- 
umes, not to mention manuscripts, pamphlets, and 
prints. He appears to have been duly enthusiastic over 
the special treasures put before his eyes by various con- 
tinental librarians whom he visited, and has thrown to- 
gether in his lecture an extremely readable collection of 
facts and fancies pertaining to the world of the biblio- 
grapher. 

The " Temple " Shakespeare (Macmillan) rounds out 
the series of the comedies with "A Winter's Tale," 
which has for frontispiece an etching of the kitchen in 
the Stratford hous3 where the poet was born, suggest- 
ing that here he may himself have listened with open- 
eyed wonder to many a winter's tale during the years 
of childhood. At the same time, the series of the his- 
tories begins with " King John," the etching in this vol- 
ume being of the king's tomb in the cathedral of Rouen. 

Mr. T. M. Clark's "Architect, Owner, and Builder 
before the Law " (Macmillau) is " a summary of Amer- 
ican and English decisions on the principal questions 
relating to building, and the employment of architects." 
It includes hundreds of references to leading cases, as 
well as a great many practical suggestions about the 
drawing of building contracts. The book is one that 
must find its way into every law library, and that all 
persons engaged in building even a single house will 
find it advisable to own.

YORK TOPICS. 

New York, February 25, 1895. 

Mr. Henry Rutgers Marshall, one of the most prom- 
ising of our rising group of architects, will shortly pub- 
lish, through Messrs. Macinillau & Co., his second vol- 
ume, "^Esthetic Principles." The studies which led 
up to the publication of his first book, " Pain, Pleasure, 
and ^Esthetics," were originally undertaken with the 
desire of seeing how far the science of aesthetics and the 
philosophy of art would avail as helps in the author's 
practice of his profession. But even then, Mr. Marshall 
thought he might at some time place the results of his 
studies in such form that they could be readily understood 
by the average worker in festhetic subjects. This notion 
was confirmed by the encouraging appreciation of " Pain, 
Pleasure, and ^Esthetics " by the best thinkers in such 
matters in this country and England; and when Mr. 
Marshall was invited to deliver a course of lectures at 
Columbia College he decided to write the new book. 
" Esthetic Principles " comprises most of what he said 
in his lectures and a good deal more besides. The au- 
thor greatly hopes that it may be found understandable 
and helpful by his fellow-craftsmen among painters, 
sculptors, architects, musicians, and literary workers in 
general. It may be considered as introductory to his 
former book, but it is also a digest, in more popular 
form, of the aesthetic principles therein discussed. An 
especially important feature is the discussion of the very 
great negative value of the teachings of the science of 
aesthetics. The author hopes that the chapter on " neg- 
ative principles " will explode many a fallacy of practice 
and criticism, giving at the same time the truly valuable 
negative principles to take their place. 

It is a long time since the youthful Pneraphs " estab- 
lished their organ, " The Germ," which was to revolu- 
tionize the world of letters and art; but whatever the 
projectors of " The Germ " accomplished in other ways, 
that periodical was soon " done for." It is really quite 
an appreciable time since the London Century Guild 
established " The Hobby Horse," which is still flourish- 
ing, having pulled through many a tight place. In the 
wake of "The Hobby Horse" have followed "The 
Knight Errant " of Boston and " The Contributor " of 
Chicago. These three periodicals are, of course, the 
progenitors of "The Yellow Book," "The Chap-Book," 
and, more recently, " The Bibelot " and " The Paper- 
Knife." Still another esoteric magazine is projected, 
41 The Chameleon," at Oxford, which probably takes its 
name from Theodore Tilton's new book of poems, " Cham- 
eleon's Dish," lately published at the Oxford Press. 
With all these should be named Elbert Hubbard's " Lit- 
tle Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great," 
brought out each month by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. Musing on the multiplication of these titbits of 
literature, one is led to wonder where the thing will 
end. No publishing firm is now so small that it may 
not have its monthly or quarterly magazinelet. All 
sorts of little books are coming out, too, by minor, or 
minute, authors, which can be taken with a tiny sand- 
wich and a cup of tea. In fact, we are witnessing what 
may be called the Afternoon Tea Movement in English 
and American literature. As for the precious wicked 
ones, they are mostly harmless enough, as Mr. Robert 
Bridges (Americanus) intimates in this week's "Life." 
When they become too nasty, they can be served in the 
same fashion as the one-eyed elder brother of the Sul- 
tan of Morocco, who has just been walled up in his 



prison at Widah; or we may import Australian lady- 
bugs to prey on these black scales of literature. 

Magazines devoted entirely to literary news and ap- 
preciations are on the increase, also, as witness the 
American edition of " The Bookman." I remember tell- 
ing one of our up-to-date New York girls a few years 
ago that we already had the " Book Buyer," the " Book 
Lore," the " Book News," the " Book Worm," and the 
" Book Chat," and that now it was proposed to publish 
the "Book Mart." Quick as a flash came the reply : 
" How about the book-martyrs ? " I am afraid this was 
a reasonable question; but enough of these papers have 
suspended to make room for the new "Bookman." 
Speaking of literary journals reminds me that Mr. 
Wheeler, of the " Literary Digest," has associated with 
himself Mr. John H. Boner, the Southern poet, as co- 
editor of that able paper. 

The Grolier Club is following its book-binding ex- 
hibit with a collection of engraved portraits of woman 
writers. About one hundred and twenty-five are to be 
represented, from Sappho to George Eliot. In some 
cases a number of portraits are given, representing the 
subject at various ages, nine likenesses of Hannah More 
being shown. There will be a " ladies' day," when Mrs. 
Elizabeth W. Champney will deliver an address. This 
exhibition will be succeeded by a complete collection of 
the engravings of Mr. Asher B. Durand, from his appren- 
ticeship to an engraver, in 1812, until he abandoned en- 
graving for painting, in 1831. 

It is rumored that still another book club is to be es- 
tablished, this time in Buffalo by Mr. Irving Browne 
and other members of the Grolier. This will be in ad- 
dition to the Philobiblon of Philadelphia, the Rowfant 
of Cleveland, and the Caxton of Chicago. The most 
important announcement of the week in the way of new 
clubs, however, is the organization of " The Society of 
Iconophiles of New York," composed of ten gentlemen 
interested in engraving and in the preservation of accu- 
rate reproductions of historic houses. Mr. William L. 
Andrews is the first president; Mr. Robert Hoe Law- 
rence is secretary and treasurer; and Messrs. Avery, 
Bierstadt, Chew, Foote, Holden, and Lefferts are among 
the members. Mr. E. D. French, who has gained wide 
reputation for the designing of book-plates, has been 
appointed engraver to the society. The first engraving 
published will be a view of old St. Paul's Church in 
New York. It will be followed by views of the Bowl- 
ing Green and Fraunces Tavern. Fifty copies of each 
of the first ten engravings will be for sale, and may be 
obtained of Mr. James O. Wright, No. 6 East 42d st. 

Professor H. H. Boyesen has finally completed the 
" Essays on Scandinavian Literature," on which he has 
been engaged for several years, and they will be pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Scribner early in March. Chap- 
ters will be devoted to Bjornson, Jonas Lie, Alexander 
Kielland, Hans Christian Andersen, Georg Brandes, 
Esaias Tegner, and others; as well as a chapter on the 
minor Danish authors. Professor Boyesen has had a 
personal acquaintance with many of these writers. The 
announcement of a novel by Andrew Lang, " A Monk 
of Fife," dealing with the life and times of Joan of 
Arc, in view of the Harper novel on the same subject, 
raises an interesting question of literary priority. Who 
thought of it first, and who began it first ? I learn that 
" Coffee and Repartee," by Mr. John Kendrick Bangs, 
has reached a sale of thirty thousand copies. The first 
edition of the sequel, " The Idiot," will number seven 
thousand, five hundred. ARTHUR STEDMAN.

[March 1, 



A WINTER DREAM OF SUMMER. 



Mother of Poesy, dear Idleness! 

To-day I 'm thine in this cool nook of earth ; 

The hills all green around us at their birth, 

And goodly fields, and trees in summer dress. 

Oh, come and greet me with thine old caress. 

Come and receive me to thy house and hearth, 

Bring all thy music, waken all thy mirth, 

Pour round me all thy dreams that soothe and bless! 

Not minutes, but long dreamful hours are thine, 
And time for life to ripen on the bough 
Her royal fruitage, love, and thought, and soul; 
And these are they that pour the mellow wine 
Of song, with light to clear the careworn brow, 
Song, richest draught that sparkles in life's bowl. 

O. C. AURINGER. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Auguste Vacquerie died at Paris on the nineteenth 
of February. 

Messrs. Stone & Kimball will publish "St. Ives," 
Stevenson's posthumous novel. 

The February number of " The Bibelot " is devoted 
to selections from Mr. John Payne's translation of Villon. 

Mr. Sidney Colvin asks for such of Robert Louis 
Stevenson's letters as their owners may be willing to 
submit for publication. 

The English department of Yale is about to produce 
Ben Jonson's " Silent Woman," with a carefully studied 
Elizabethan stage-setting. 

Reginald Stuart Poole, born in London in 1832, died 
at Kensington on the eighth of February. Archaeology 
and numismatics were the subjects of his best-known 
books. 

The Authors' Guild will have an Authors' Reading 
in New York on the evening of April 20. Mr. M. D. 
Conway has agreed to represent the Guild unofficially 
in England. 

" In Stevenson's Land," by Miss Marie Fraser, an- 
nounced by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., is certainly 
timely, and its subject possesses, in addition, indepen- 
dent interest. 

A search has recently been made in Italy for the 
tomb of Vittoria Colonna, and her remains have been 
positively identified, with those of her husband, in a 
church at Naples. 

It is announced that there will be this year no Turn- 
bull lectures on poetry at the Johns Hopkins University, 
but that Dr. George A. Smith, of Glasgow, has been 
engaged for a course on Hebrew poetry in 1896. 

The Tsar of Russia has ordered the appointment of 
a commission to found, in memory of the late Alexander, 
an institution where a home will be provided for dis- 
abled authors, artists, and actors. It was only a few 
weeks ago that he gave out of his privy purse the sum 
of 50,000 rubles for the purpose of providing pensions 
for authors. 

The lately organized Caxton Club of Chicago has 
made a good beginning in providing for what promises 
to be a very interesting exhibition of fine book bind- 
ings, to be held at the Art Institute, opening March 4. 



The collection includes examples of the work of many 
of the most famous binders, at home and abroad, and 
it will doubtless receive due attention and admiration 
from book-lovers. 

The long-heralded American edition of the London 
"Bookman," published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., 
has at last sent forth its first number. It proves to be 
a magazine of some seventy pages, illustrated, contain- 
ing reviews, miscellaneous essays on literary subjects, 
much gossip of a rather trivial sort, and useful tabula- 
tions of book sales and current publications. The mag- 
azine is attractively printed, and we wish it every suc- 
cess. 

Dr. Richard Garnett, in " The Speaker " of London, 
pays the following poetical tribute to the four recent 
dead among English authors Syrnonds, Pater, Hamer- 
ton, and Stevenson: 

Child of the great Rebirth, who most of men 

Didst steep in Italy the English soul : 

Thou, Phidias of discourse, who couldst control 
Speech to Form's purity by shaping pen : 
Thou who all Art didst learn to teach again : 

And thou whose Art was Nature from the scroll 

Of Life how swiftly blotted ! golden toll 
Cast to the oarsman of the Stygian fen ! 
Of you who had not said, " Behold in these 

The strenuous growth Time mellows to endure, 

More rich, more fair for annual season found ! " 
dupes and scoffs of empty auguries ! 

Still flourishes the weed, the tree mature 
With stem and bough and fruitage loads the ground. 

As indicated in the last issue of THE DIAL, the ob- 
jection to the Covert Copyright Bill rests in its form 
and not in the principle involved. The proposed amend- 
ment, as it passed the Committee on Patents, tended to 
make damages nominal in both literary and artistic in- 
fringements, whereas the intention originally was to 
prevent excessive damages in the case of art and pho- 
tography alone. Last week Thursday a meeting of 
representatives of the Publishers' and Authors' Copy- 
right Leagues, and a committee from the American 
Newspaper Publishers' Association, was held in New 
York. Messrs. J. Henry Harper, George Haven Put- 
nam, Edmund C. Stedman, and Robert Underwood 
Johnson were present, together with Mr. William C. 
Bryant of the Brooklyn " Times," Mr. H. F. Gunnison 
of the Brooklyn "Eagle," and Mr. C. W. Knapp of the 
St. Louis " Republic." A revised draft of the Covert 
amendment was drawn up, relating to art works and 
photographs alone, and fixing penalties for infringe- 
, ment in such cases at from one hundred to ten thous- 
and dollars. It is hoped that this draft may be substi- 
tuted without difficulty when the Covert bill comes up 
in Congress. 

The presentation of the " (Edipus Rex " of Sophocles, 
at Beloit College, on the 22d of February, was an event 
in the history of both the town and the college. All 
the details were under the immediate charge of Profes- 
sor Theodore L. Wright, and the result reflected much 
credit upon him and his colaborers. The tragedy was 
rendered into English verse by the class of 1897, as a 
part of their term's work in the Greek drama; the 
classic forms of stilted expression were avoided, and 
modern dignified English phrase was employed. Other 
presentations, in the original, with elaborate setting, 
have been given; but it is doubtful if the true spirit of 
the " (Edipus " has ever been as well presented in 
America, in interpretation, translation, or faithfulness

of costume. The stage was nearly square, and was oc- 
cupied on the same level by both actors and chorus, ac- 
cording to the later conception of the ancient setting; 
the scenery represented a palace in a forest near Thebes, 
and the costumes were all especially designed from the 
drapery on the figures seen on ancient Greek vases. 
The role of " (Edipus " was taken by Mr. C. W. Wood 
of the Senior class, whose interpretation, particularly in 
the frenzied passages at the climax of the tragedy, 
was thought by many to be comparable to Salvini's 
" Othello." The part of " Jocasta " was played with 
great credit by Mr. Loomis, as was that of " Creon " by 
Mr. Rose. The chorus of bearded Thebans, with Mr. 
Atkinson as Choragos, was especially strong; and their 
rythmic and strange dances, to the flute music especially 
prepared by Professor Allen, brought visible relief to 
the intense strain of the audience. The play was largely 
attended, not only by Beloit people, but by visitors from 
Chicago and other neighboring cities.

Dr. Parkhurst's Book, 

OUR FIGHT WITH 

TAMMANY. 

By Rev. CHARLES H. PARKHURST, 

D.D. 12mo, $1.25. 

"There can be no doubt that ' Dr. Park- 
hurst's book' will have a wide sale, not 
only because it gives the whole story of his 
crusade in condensed, get-at-able form, but 
because every man and woman who lives 
in a city or town where there is official 
corruption and where is there not ? will 
read it to learn how the work of reforma- 
tion may be carried on. The book is a mon- 
ument to Dr. Parkhurst, raised by his own 
hands." The Chicago Tribune. 

" An extraordinary volume, which no 
one can afford to leave unread. It is the 
history of a great period in the life of a 
great city. It is also the partial autobi- 
ography of a remarkable man. It is finally 
a practical guide to the problem of muni- 
cipal reform." The Examiner. 

" It is the most fascinating volume that 
lias appeared this year, and we predict that 
it will be read by more people than all 
novels put together." Christian Work. 

" It is one of the remarkable histories 
of the times." Chicago Inter-Ocean. 

The Life and Adventures 

OF 

GEORGE 
AUGUSTUS SAL A. 

Written by Himself. With Portrait. 

2 vols., 8vo, $5.00. 

"A singularly interesting autobiogra- 
phy. There have been published a mul- 
titude of autobiographical recollections, 
more than one of which has been charac- 
terized as a storehouse of anecdotal liter- 
ature and of materials for the history of 
the times. But no other compilation of 
personal reminiscences deserves so thor- 
oughly to be thus described as the delight- 
ful book here noticed." M. W. Haze/tine, 
in the New York Sun. 

" It is the ' livest ' book of the season ; 
full of all sorts of information as 'to all 
sorts of people ; bristling with anecdote." 
Brooklyn Eagle. 

" Two delightful volumes. There is not 
a dull page in either volume. " Boston 
Advertiser.

History of the United States. 

By E. BENJAMIN ANDREWS, D.D., LL.D., President of Brown University. With 

Maps. 2 vols., crown 8vo, $4.00. 

" It is admirably arranged ; it gives much information not hitherto directly accessible to the 
general reader ; it impresses one as being fair in its representations and unprejudiced in its 
judgments; it gives a wonderfully broad and satisfactory view of national growth, and it is 
decidedly attractive in style terse, pointed, emphatic, yet never tiresome." Boston Beacon. 



"The freshest and most readable treatise of 
its class." Watchman. 

" It is heartily to be commended, sure to 
delight and instruct." New York Observer. 

" His style is clear and concise. One reads 
with accumulated interest to the end." 
Christian Advocate. 

" Unquestionably of value. He is a man of 
broad and judicial mind." R. H. Sloddard, 
in Mail and Express. 



" It must be acknowledged as a standard, 
reliable and trustworthy." Boston Times. 

" One of the best popular histories of Amer- 
ica, if not the best." Advance.

ard.

New Book by the Bight Hon. A. J. BALFOUR. 

THE FOUNDATIONS OF BELIEF. 

Being Notes Introductory to the Study of Theology. 
By the Right Hon. ARTHUR J. BALFOUR, M.P. 

Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

" It is a book of so much philosophical and dialectical ability that were it the work of an 
unheard-of writer it would make him an immediate reputation. ... Is extremely well written, 
in good, manly prose, without a bit of deliberate fine writing, but often rising with the elevation 
of the thought to great dignity and beauty of expression. . . . Mr. Balfour has a remarkable 
gift for apt and striking illustration, and his illustrations have the quality of his mind. They are 
as fresh as they are forcible. Then, too, he is a master of the strong, illuminating phrase. . . . 
However we may feel about the course of Mr. Balfour's argument, and the conclusions to which 
he arrives, we must be very churlish if we do not enjoy his dialectic all the way along, and not 
only that, but many bright and telling passages which are wonderfully suggestive, even where 
they do not command our full assent. At least we can so far agree with him as he agrees with Wordsworth's magic phrase, ' We feel that we are 
greater than we know.' And then, too, we must thank him not only for his fascinating book, but, in advance, for the lively and interesting dis- 
cussion which it is certain to provoke." Standard Union (Brooklyn). 

" This review of Mr. Balfour's book has been casual. Indeed, it has been confined to a hasty outline of his discussion of aesthetics. It may, 
however, give the reader a hint of the sound thinking and clear reasoning to be found between the covers of ' The Foundations of Belief.' It is 
one of the most notable books of the year, and no one who aims to keep in touch with modern thought can afford to leave it unread." 
Commercial Advertiser (New York). 

"Perhaps the greatest service which the leader of Opposition has rendered to this generation is not the influence which he exerts as the head 
of the Conservative party in the House of Commons, but the force with which, in this striking work, he has illustrated the influence of Authority 
in the evolution of beliefs, both true and false." Spectator. 

" . . . Mr. Balfour has put great thoughts into burning words, and the range, as well as the profundity, of his argumentation will certainly 
provide abundance of matter for the digestion of the intellectual world for some time to come." Manchester Courier. 

" This book, modestly termed 'Notes,' is one of the chief contributions to philosophy made for many years in England. Mr. Balfour has 
much to say of some modern controversies and fallacies which were on the way to oblivion even as he wrote. But no fresher and keener examin- 
ation of dominant systems of thought, no more luminous statement of objections dimly seen by many less acute than he, no more suggestive dis- 
cussion of old, but ever new, problems, has appeared here for many years." Times (London). 

" This volume will be universally recognized as a most interesting and important contribution to the greatest controversy of the time. . . .' r 
Daily News (London).

CORRECTED IMPRESSIONS. 

By GEORGE SAINTSBURY. Crown 8vo, $1.25. 

" The most learned and vivacious of living critics " in these charming 
papers has thrown the light of present literary judgment on the great 
Victorian writers, and has given us not only "corrected impressions," 
but by his original insight has widened our knowledge of these authors 
in their relation to literature. 

THE REAL CHINAMAN. 

By CHESTER HOLCOMBE, late Secretary U. S. Lega- 
tion at Pekin. Illustrated with 80 engravings from 
photographs collected by the author. 8vo, $2.00. 

Mr. Holcombe's residence of sixteen years in China, his masterly 
and ready use of the language, and his exceptional opportunities for 
knowing the Chinese in their homes, have qualified him, as few Ameri- 
cans are qualified, to describe the Chinaman not as he seems, but as 
he is. 

THE WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES. 

By C. DE VARIGNY. Translated from the French by 
ARABELLA WARD. 12mo, $1.25. 

The author was for several years in the French consular service in 
this country, and his studies, on their appearance in the Revue des 
Deux Mondes, provoked considerable criticism both in France and 
America on account of their extreme candor. American women will 
at least have an opportunity of seeing themselves " as others see us " in 
a work of a highly entertaining and instructive character. 

THE IMPREGNABLE CITY. 

A Novel. By MAX PEMBERTON, author of " The Iron 
Pirate," "Jewel Mysteries," etc. 12mo, $1.25. 

Max Pemberton's stories for boys brought him to the front some 
time ago, and his ''Jewel Mysteries " met with a wide appreciation last 
autumn. In the novel now issued he has produced a strong bit of work 
which will give him a place among the new novelists. 

STRANGE PAGES FROM FAMILY

' Play," The Ghost World," etc. 12mo, $1.50.

MOST TIMELY BOOK OF THE YEAR. 



" [Military Career of 

S^apoleon the Great." 

By MONTGOMERY B. GIBBS. 

Not a technical military history, but a gossipy 
anecdotal account of the career of U^apoleon 
Tlonaparte as bis marshals and generals knew 
him on the battlefield and around the camp-fire. 

" With a reservation in favor of Lord Wolseley's papers on the same 
lines which are, of course, more technical in tone one knows of no 
equally entertaining and successful attempt to portray anecdotally the 
military career of the greatest captain since Caesar. Mr. Gibbs has 
rendered a valuable service to the Napoleonic literature." Chicago 
Evening Post (Feb. 23). 

" That the publication of Mr. M. B. Gibbs's life work on the ' Mili- 
tary Career of Napoleon the Great ' should come when a ' Napoleonic 
wave ' is passing over the world is a coincidence upon which the author 
is to be congratulated. It is an anecdotal history for general reading, 
not a critical history of the campaigns for military study, and Mr. 
Gibbs has collected within his 500 pages probably every story that has 
ever been recorded of Napoleon in the camp. As Mr. Masson pictures 
Napoleon only as lover and husband, so Mr. Gibbs shows us only the 
general. It has one conspicuous merit every line is interesting. The 
reader never wearies." New York World (March 7). 

"Mr. Gibbs's work is clearly and sharply written, and seems to have 
been brought ' down to date ' by careful study of all the memoirs re- 
cently published, of which that of Meneval is by far the best. The 
publishers of the book, The Werner Company of Chicago, have embel- 
lished it with numerous half-tone cuts, prepared from famous engrav- 
ings." New York Recorder (Feb. 24).

ciples, new theories, and new facts relating to all depart- 
ments of the science. Much additional matter, improved 
arrangement of subjects, and a largely-increased num- 
ber of illustrations add greatly to the value of the work

THE REPORT ON ELEMENTARY 
EDUCATION. 

The Preliminary Report of the Committee 
of Fifteen, presented last month to the confer- 
ence of school superintendents at Cleveland, 
is an educational document of the first import- 
ance, and at once takes rank with the Com- 
mittee of Ten's Report on Secondary Educa- 
tion. These two documents may fairly be said 
to mark a new era in educational discussion, to 
more than prepare the way for that rational 
and scientific plan of cooperation among our 
educators that has so long been hoped for, yet 
but dimly descried upon the horizon. The 
American political organization, with its un- 
paralleled measure of local autonomy, has cre- 
ated a special educational problem in the 
United States, and calls for the evolution of a 
special system adapted to its needs. We are 
doubtless still in the period of scattered aims 
and half-wasted energies, but order is slowly 
emerging from chaos. The fermentation must 
go on for many years yet ; but the clarified 
final product will, we trust, prove superior to 
the product of the centralized European sys- 
tems. We have to attain the golden mean 
between license and rigidity, to devise a plan 
sufficiently elastic to fit with all of our widely 
varied conditions, to combine respect for law 
in the fundamentals with much exercise of free- 
dom in the details. 

To the National Educational Association is 
due our gratitude for the movement which has 
resulted in the two Reports above alluded to. 
The Committee which has framed the Report 
now to be considered was appointed at the in- 
stance of the Association early in 1893. It 
was divided into three sections of five members 
each, having for their respective subjects " The 
Training of Teachers," "The Correlation of 
Studies," and " The Organization of City 
School Systems." Nearly two years have been 
spent in the collection and collation of expert 
opinion upon these three subjects ; the digested 
result now appears in the Report as presented 
at Cleveland. The text of this Report makes 
up the entire contents of the March issue of 
" The Educational Review," and is thus easily 
accessible to the public. The members of the 
sub-committees are nearly unanimous in their 



168 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



respective recommendations. To the first sec- 
tion of the Eeport there is no dissenting voice ; 
to the third, but one or two trifling divergences 
of opinion. To the second alone, as one might 
have predicted from its subject, are any con- 
siderable number of exceptions taken. These 
minority opinions, while helpful as offering 
special points of view, tend, of course, to 
weaken the force of the document as a whole, 
and are, pro tanto, to be regretted. 

The first section of the Report, signed, as we 
have said, by all five members of the sub-com- 
mittee, lays down the fundamental principles 
that should be consulted in the training of 
teachers for their professional work. At the 
start, the requirement is made of high-school 
education for elementary work, and of collegiate 
education for secondary work. We have no 
doubt that the equivalent for these respective 
amounts of school-study would be acceptable 
to the signers of this Report, but we wish that 
it had been more explicitly stated. If a teacher 
has the necessary education, it does not matter 
where or how he got it ; yet the indolence of 
school officers, or their tendency to discrimi- 
nate in favor of routine acquisition, often 
makes them look askance at a well-prepared 
applicant merely because he has not been 
through the regular educational mill. Again, 
when we come to the main subject of the Re- 
port the kind and amount of professional 
training that ought to be exacted of teachers 
in addition to the merely academic prepara- 
tion we cannot help noting a tendency to 
ignore the fact that a considerable number of 
the best teachers need little or none of this 
special training, although there is no doubt of 
its' beneficial effect upon the rank and file. 
Still, those who are fitted by natural parts or 
predispositions to dispense with normal school 
training ought not to have it forced upon them. 
The test of practical success is worth more 
than any academic tests whatsoever, and some 
way of giving it a trial ought to be devised for 
use in promising cases of well-developed nat- 
ural aptitude. 

This exception being taken, we are free to 
admit that most young men and women who 
look to teaching for a career will be helped by 
the work of the professional school. The first 
point considered is whether academic studies 
belong to the course of such a school. The 
admission is made, although somewhat grudg- 
ingly, " that methods can practically be taught 
only as subjects," and that the work of the 
normal school " may so treat of the subjects of 



study, not as objects to be acquired, but as ob- 
jects to be presented, that their treatment shall 
be wholly professional." We believe that the 
work of a normal school should be very largely 
of this character, and wish that the Report 
had more distinctly emphasized its importance. 
But there still remains, of course, a certain 
amount of professional training of a more 
technical character, and with this the major 
part of the Report is concerned. The follow- 
ing six elements of such training are differ- 
entiated: Psychology, Methodology, School 
economy, Educational history, Observation of 
teaching, and Practice-teaching under criti- 
cism. We think that the Report overestimates 
the relative importance of the last two of these 
six elements in recommending that one-half of 
the total period of training be devoted to them. 
On the other hand, there is no undue exagger- 
ation in the position so squarely assumed with 
reference to psychology. " Most fundamental 
and important of the professional studies which 
ought to be pursued by one intending to teach 
is psychology." This is no whit too emphatic, 
and it has our cordial approval. But by psy- 
chology must be understood the real thing, not 
the sorry stuff that parades under that name 
in too many of our normal schools, and which 
consists for the most part of empirical facts 
couched in a meaningless jargon. " Pyschology, 
what crimes are committed in thy name ! " is 
an exclamation that must often rise to the lips 
of those who have had occasion to make ac- 
quaintance with the popular text-books of the 
past generation. On the whole, scientific psy- 
chology being given, together with the thorough 
study of a few carefully chosen subjects con- 
sidered " as objects to be presented," we should 
be inclined to make light of special methodol- 
ogy, of school economy, and of the history of 
education. These things will all be added, in 
due time, to the equipment of the serious 
teacher, but they are not of the essentials, and 
the mind that has had the proper fundamental 
discipline may as well be left to find its way to 
them unaided. 

The Report on the organization of city school 
systems exhibits sound judgment and a proper 
distribution of emphasis. " The instruction 
will be ineffective and abnormally expensive 
unless put upon a scientific educational basis 
and supervised by competent educational ex- 
perts." These words from the opening pages 
of the Report summarize its recommendations. 
More specifically, the Report calls for a con- 
centration of responsibility for appointment 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



169 



rather than election of school directors ; for 
boards of education numbering from five to 
fifteen members, " not chosen to represent any 
ward or subdivision of the territory or any 
party or element in the political, religious, or 
social life thereof "; for absolute independence 
of the superintendent in all matters relating to 
the selection of teachers and the shaping of 
instruction. The latter of these points is the 
most important, and here the language of the 
Report has no uncertain sound. "A city school 
system," we are told, " may be able to with- 
stand some abuses on the business side of its 
administration and continue to perform its 
function with measurable success, but wrongs 
against the instruction must, in a little time, 
prove fatal. Government by the people has 
no more dangerous pitfall than this, that in 
the mighty cities of the land the comfortable 
and intelligent masses, who are discriminat- 
ing more and more closely about the educa- 
tion of their children, shall become dissatisfied 
with the social status of the teachers and the 
quality of the teaching in the common schools. 
In that event, they will educate their children 
at their own expense, and the public schools 
will become only good enough for those who 
can afford no better." 

There is one way, and one way only, to avert 
this danger. The whole work of instruction 
must be put upon a professional and scientific 
basis by securing competent teachers, ade- 
quately compensating them for their work, as- 
suring them of fixed tenure and advancement 
according to merit, and reducing to a minimum 
the formal regulations and petty restrictions 
that hamper the individual and wantonly lower 
the tone of the whole teaching-force. Now all 
" this cannot be secured if there is any lack of 
authority, and experience amply proves that it 
will not be secured if there is any division of 
responsibility." We have to choose between 
a superintendent fully empowered in these 
matters and fully responsible, on the one hand, 
and "administration by boards or committees" 
on the other. Whatever may be the possibili- 
ties of evil in the former alternative, they are 
trifling when compared with the well-proved 
evils of the latter. Boards or committees are 
simply " not competent to manage professional 
matters and develope an expert teaching-force. 
Yet they assume, and in most cases honestly, 
the knowledge of the most experienced. They 
override and degrade a superintendent, when 
they have the power to do so, until he becomes 
their mere factotum. For the sake of harmony 



and the continuance of his position, he con- 
cedes, surrenders, and acquiesces in their acts, 
while the continually increasing teaching-force 
becomes weaker and weaker and the work 
poorer and poorer. If he refuses to do this, they 
precipitate an open rupture and turn him out 
of his position. Then they cloud the issues and 
shift the responsibility from one to another." 

This vigorous exposure of a great evil and 
suggestion of a remedy carries conviction in 
its every phrase. It is indeed, as the Report 
says, " unprofitable to mince words about this 
all-important matter." The dissenting opinions 
of individual members of the Committee are 
upon trifling matters of detail, and only serve 
to bring out by contrast their unanimity upon 
the great questions at issue. Dealing with the 
weightiest of educational matters, this Report 
voices the great body of intelligent opinion, and 
cannot fail to become a power for good. It 
will be read by every American educator worthy 
of the name, and will strengthen its readers in 
their determination to uphold the dignity of 
their profession, to resist to the utmost the ef- 
forts everywhere made by the vulgar dema- 
gogue and the ignorant politician to fit our city 
school systems to their base ideals. 

The third and longest of the Reports, hav- 
ing for its subject the correlation of elemen- 
tary studies, must be reserved for considera- 
tion at some other time. It is marked off from 
the two others by its academical or philosoph- 
ical, as distinguished from their distinctively 
practical, character, and it raises a set of prob- 
lems of an entirely different sort. It is also 
the only Report which exhibits a serious diver- 
gence of opinion on the part of those who have 
drawn it up. It may well, for these reasons, 
be made the subject of a separate article. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE HUMANITIES AND THE SCIENCES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Culture deprecates polemics. It rejoices when forces 
unite that were before at odds. Yet how often is " cul- 
ture " made the battle-cry of partisanship. It has been 
so in the formation of our college curricula. The hu- 
manities were first supreme in the universities. But 
their supremacy was not long unchallenged. The sci- 
ences called for admission. Unfortunately, this was at 
first denied. They had to fight their way in step by 
step. Just as unfortunately, the sciences, now having 
gained high ground, look down patronizingly at the 
humanities. And there is back-biting between the two. 

But better things are near. At first, forced toleration, 
then self-sought copartnership, will result. The scien- 
tist is seeing that he must be broadly human ; and the 



170 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



humanist is becoming scientific. Sir Philip Sidney said 
of Cato : " He misliked, and cried out against, all Greek 
learning, and yet, being fourscore years old, began to 
learn it, belike fearing that Pluto understood not Latin." 
So the scientist, crying out against the humanistic learn- 
ing, and regarding its language as pedantry, will in time 
be forced to acquire it, if for no other reason, to gain 
the ear of a culture even more exacting perhaps than 
was Pluto. " What lumps of raw fact are flung at our 
heads ! " wrote Frederic Harrison. " Through what tan- 
gles of uninteresting phenomena are we not dragged in 
the name of Research, Truth, and the higher Philosophy! 
Mr. Mill and Mr. Spencer, Mr. Bain and Mr. Sidgwick, 
have taught our age very much ; but no one of them was 
ever seen to smile ; and it is not easy to recall in their 
voluminous works a single irradiating image or one mon- 
umental phrase." This is the over-statement of parti- 
sanship. But it indicates the nature of the demand that 
will humanize the sciences. 

On the other hand, the humanities are growing up to 
the level of the scientific conscience. History and lit- 
erature are becoming scientific studies. Sociology, the 
humanity of humanities, is making good its claim to be 
reckoned with as a science. 

Thus each is learning from the other. Science and 
the humanities alike are carried on by men. And sym- 
pathetic intercourse is discovering^ a common standing 
place and horizon. Ogden N. Rood, professor of phy- 
sics at Columbia, was speaking of his walks and talks 
with the late Dr. Merriam, professor of Greek. "Dur- 
ing these," he said, " I became a great deal better ac- 
quainted with his habits of mind than I had ever been 
before, and was very much astonished to find that he 
undertook to treat those matters those things that hap- 
pened ages and ages ago very much upon the same 
principles that we employ in physical laboratories. I 
would say to him, with regard to a certain theory : 
' This thing looks all right, isn't that so ? ' He would 
reply, ' Yes, it is plausible ; there are some things in its 
favor, but not enough ; we need to study the matter a 
great deal more.' So, from time to time, it happened 
to me that I received at his hands a dose of my own 
medicine the kind of medicine that we are in the habit 
of administering to students in the physical laboratory." 

Intercourse such as this will harmonize the efforts of 
educators. We shall have a wide curriculum in our 
colleges wide enough for the sciences and the human- 
ities to run side by side to the same goal. Students, 
taking the hand of either, will not be led, one east, one 
west, as so often happens now.

ROME AND CHICAGO. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Some years ago I noticed the near coincidence of the 
latitudes of Rome and Chicago. Thomas's Gazeteer 
gives the latitude of St. Peter's as 41 54' 6". The lati- 
tude of Dearborn Observatory at the former Chicago 
University was 41 50' 1". Mr. Elias Colbert favored 
me with the information that at Chicago one minute 
of latitude is 6074 feet in length hence one second of 
latitude is 101.23 feet. With these data and maps of 
the cities, I find these relations of place: 

Extend our Madison street straight east, and it will 
run over the Aventine Hill. Van Buren street's line 
passes just south of the Aurelian Wall, near the Porta 
Appia. St. Peter's is east of Maple street, and the area 



between Maple and Oak streets, with the Vatican ex- 
tending north across Division street. The middle of the 
Forum is about east of Indiana street: the Colosseum 
corresponds to the space between Illinois and Kinzie 
streets. The Theatre of Pompey, place of the greatest 
of assassinations, the fall of Julius Caesar, lay almost 
exactly in the line of Erie street. 

The whole of old Rome, then, as bounded by the 
Aurelian Wall, lay between the latitudes of our Schiller 
street and Van Buren street. 

Compared with our modern cities, the area of Rome 
was small. The Servian city, that is, the city included 
within the walls ascribed to Servius Tullius, thus the 
city strictly, as known to Caesar, Cicero, and Horace 
had an area almost exactly two square miles ; our great 
fire of 1871 ran over three and one-fourth square miles 
of surface, or as much as the Servian city and sixty-two 
per cent more. The Aurelian Walls added about as 
much as our burnt area, say three and three-eighths 
square miles, making the new area 5.3228 square miles, 
say five and one-third square miles. In our city, the area 
bounded by North avenue and Harrison street, Ashland 
avenue and the Lake Shore, is rather large for this. 

If now we add the later annexations west of the Ti- 
ber, the Leonine city, say nine-sixteenths of a square 
mile, we have a total area of 5.8831 square miles, al- 
most six miles; less than is included by our Chicago 
avenue, Ashland avenue, Twenty - second street, and 
State street. Such was the mighty ruler of the civil- 
ized world. 

It is to be wished that we could deal with population 
as we can with latitudes and areas. But a Roman cen- 
sus did not involve an enumeration of the whole popu- 
lation in our sense of the term: its main object was to 
make up the voting lists, dividing the voters into cen- 
turies,* the tax lists, and the military lists: hence we 
have not definite information. We have a census of 
houses taken by the emperor Theodosius, which found 
of the houses (domus) of the rich, 1780; and of the in- 
sulce, flats and dwellings of the middle class and poor, 
46,602. 

The population of Rome under the early emperors, 
say in the first century, is estimated by Gibbon (chap, 
xxxi.) at 1,200,000. With this, Milman, from whose 
notes I quote, agreed; Dureau de la Malle says 562,- 
000, or less than half of Gibbon's number. Zumpt says 
2,000,000; Dr. Thomas Henry Dyer, the sturdy de- 
fender of the reality of Romulus and Numa Pompilius, 
estimates aliens, 100,000; slaves, 800,000; and a total 
population of 2,045,000. Hoeck raises it to 2,265,000; 
and Lipsius crowns all with 8,000,000! Where could 
he stow them away ? If we leave out Lipsius's exag- 
geration and take the average of the estimates of the 
other six, we have 1,545,333: a number not far from 
the present population of our city by the lake. 

But if Chicago be like old Rome in latitude and in 
population, God forbid that our city follow the other in 
the horrors of her history! SAMUEL WILLARD.

* Centuries. I venture to call in question the ordinary der- 
ivation of this word from centum, a hundred. I think centu- 
ria to be an identical form from two unrelated roots, like jet, 
lake, last, scald, in English. Thus from centum we have cen- 
turia, a collection of a hundred things, and centurion; but 
from censeo, with fundamental meaning to divide, discrimin- 
ate, we have century, a division of the people, censor, the officer 
who made the division, census, and censure ; and these have 
no relation to number.

THE LIVES OF Two ENGLISH 
NATURALISTS.* 



The two eminent English naturalists, Pro- 
fessor Richard Owen and Dean Buckland, were 
for many years coadjutors in science, in phil- 
anthropy, and social reforms. Every measure 
for the general good received their hearty sym- 
pathy and support. They were men of integ- 
rity rare and fine, with personal traits adding 
the finishing grace to their mental endowments. 
They adorned the new learning, to which they 
lent dignity and distinction. The records of 
their life-work, published simultaneously by an 
American house, borrow interest from each 
other. They are fitting monuments to the mem- 
ory of two noble scholars and faithful expo- 
nents of the best spirit of the nineteenth century. 

It is illustrious and charming company to 
which we are introduced in the volumes com- 
memorating the life of Richard Owen, "the 
Cuvier of England." From the very outset 
of his career he came in contact with distin- 
guished personages, and, winning his way rap- 
idly among them, the circle of his friendly and 
familiar acquaintance widened, until seemingly 
it embraced every notable character from the 
heads of the Royal House down through the 
various ranks of inherent and acquired nobility. 
He bore himself through it all with the quiet, 
simple grace of one born to the purple, or, bet- 
ter still, of one unconscious of worldly honors 
and successes, intent solely upon the accom- 
plishment of the work he was given to do. 

Richard Owen was born in Lancaster in 
1805. His father dying in the boy's early 
childhood, he was left to the care and guardian- 
ship of his mother, a woman of rare intelligence 
and refinement. She was of French extraction, 
and from her the son doubtless derived many 
of his mental gifts and personal attractions. 
As a schoolboy he did not in any way distin- 
guish himself, unless, as his sister said, by being 
" very small and slight, and exceedingly mis- 
chievous." At the age of sixteen he was appren- 
ticed to a surgeon, who was, in the words of the

indenture, to teach him the " arts, business, pro- 
fession and mysteries of a surgeon, apothecary, 
and man midwife, with every circumstance re- 
lating thereto." His new situation undoubtedly 
revealed him to himself, for he discovered imme- 
diately the pursuit for which he was endowed, 
that of dissecting animal organisms and dis- 
cerning their internal structure and relations. 
A term at the Edinburgh University in the 
winter of 1824-25 was so faithfully improved 
that his chief medical instructor commended 
him to the patronage of the famous Abernethy 
of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Mr. 
Owen afterwards said : 

" I shall never forget the day when I arrived for the 
first time in London, where I had literally not one sin- 
gle friend. . . . The sense of desolation which I expe- 
rienced in walking up Holborn towards St. Bartholo- 
mew's Hospital . . . was something indescribable." 

The contrast is sharp between this experi- 
ence of the desolate youth, not yet twenty-one, 
and that which, after a brief interval, enriched 
all his remaining years. Dr. Abernethy di- 
vined his abilities at a glance, and gave him 
the post of prosector for his lectures. The 
following year he became a member of the 
Royal College of Surgeons, and was appointed 
assistant curator of the Museum, with a salary 
of six hundred dollars a year. In another 
twelvemonth he was lecturing upon compara- 
tive anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 
Professor Owen earned his promotions by tire- 
less toil. In addition to his work as curator 
and lecturer, he cultivated a small medical prac- 
tice at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and gave his ser- 
vices liberally to the sick poor within his reach. 
He availed himself of the opportunity of dis- 
secting the animals which died under the care 
of the Zoological Society of London, and thus 
secured valuable materials for increasing his 
knowledge of comparative anatomy. At the 
age of twenty-six he began the long and able 
series of original papers contributed to the 
various learned associations of London, and 
these papers soon procured him the rank of 
leading anatomist in England, and after the 
death of Cuvier, of all Europe. Eight of these 
valuable monographs were the product of his 
twenty- seventh year. Directly after them came 
the famous " Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus," 
which established his repute everywhere among 
his peers. Along with this manifold and severe 
work, he was performing the herculean task of 
cataloguing the Hunterian Collections, compris- 
ing 3970 specimens, all requiring careful ex- 
amination and description. The completed lists 
filled five octavo volumes. They were the fruit

of stupendous labor, but it had afforded their 
compiler a liberal education in his special de- 
partment. 

It is impossible to speak in detail of Owen's 
achievements. They may be summed up in a 
passage from Professor Huxley : 

" During more than half a century Owen's industry 
continued unabated; and whether we consider the quan- 
tity, or the quality, of the work done, or the wide range 
of his labors, I doubt if, in the long annals of anatomy, 
more is to be placed to the credit of any single worker." 

Among the men of letters who were drawn 
to the great master of science, Carlyle was con- 
spicuous, himself requesting an interview with 
" the tall man with glittering eyes " who had 
excited his interest. Visits were exchanged 
between them, after which Owen said to his 
wife : "I have such a dread of the personality 
of an author destroying in great measure his 
ideality, that I am pleased to find in this case 
that it is not so, and that Carlyle proved to be, 
as far as 1 am concerned, much what one could 
wish." Carlyle described Owen as that rare 
thing among men, " neither a fool nor a hum- 
bug." Mrs. Owen jotted down in her journal, 
after one of Carlyle's interesting visits : 

" It is curious how like his books Carlyle's conversa- 
tion is. He grew very eloquent when telling us of the 
way in which he is plagued by people who would insist 
upon sending him their books. Young ladies especially 
often wanted his opinion on their poetry. ' I hate po- 
etry,' he said comically. I asked him if he hated 
Home's ' Orion.' Ah,' he said, ' Home's a clever man.' " 

Leave should not be taken of the eminent 
anatomist without giving one example of his 
remarkable power of re-creating an entire ani- 
mal structure from a small given fact. The 
fragment of a thigh-bone, unearthed in New 
Zealand, was brought him by a sailor one day. 
It belonged to no existing creature, and its like 
Owen had never seen. After a brief inspection 
he drew the entire femur, and built upon it a 
gigantic wingless bird, which at full size would 
exceed the ostrich, reaching a stature of sixteen 
feet. The description he presented to the 
Zoological Society excited intense surprise and 
incredulity. It was with difficulty that Owen 
secured the admission of his monograph in the 
Proceedings of the Society. He waited with 
eagerness further discoveries of the skeleton of 
Zhnornis, as he named the huge bird. When 
in the course of years, bones composing the en- 
tire frame of the avian were found and for- 
warded to him, they conformed exactly with 
the structure he had prefigured. 

In 1856, through the generous services of 
Macaulay, Professor Owen was appointed Su- 



perintendent of the Departments of Natural 
History in the British Museum. To his per- 
sistent efforts in organizing and furthering the 
plan, England owes the establishment of the 
superb institution at South Kensington, which 
houses the crowded and neglected collections 
formerly under the roof of the British Museum. 
With the completion of this enterprise in the 
year 1883, the work of the great anatomist was 
practically done. The Queen had generously 
furnished him a home in one of the houses per- 
taining to the crown Sheen Lodge, Richmond 
Park, which his family are permitted still to 
occupy. He had declined the honor of knight- 
hood offered by Sir Robert Peel in 1845, but 
accepted it on a second presentation in his old 
age. Honors had fallen thick upon him dur- 
ing his long and distinguished career, and gen- 
tle, peaceful memories sweetened his declining 
years. His passing was with the last days of 
1892, and like one gliding into dreamless sleep. 
Appended to his biography is a comprehen- 
sive and discriminating survey of " Owen's Po- 
sition in the History of Anatomical Science," 
by Professor Huxley. A number of portraits 
and illustrations enrich the work, which is com- 
pleted by a bibliography of the scientific pa- 
pers published by Professor Owen, covering 
fifty pages, a list of the honorary distinctions 
conferred upon him, numbering nearly a hun- 
dred, and an index. 

The life of Dean Buckland carries us back 
to the early part of our century and the begin- 
ning of the acquisitions of modern science. 
He was one of the fathers of geology, who laid 
the foundations of that domain of knowledge, 
along with such intellectual giants as Sedgwick, 
Murchison, and Lyell. Dr. Buckland had the 
advantage of a training in natural history from 
his boyhood, his father, the Rev. Charles Buck- 
land of Devon, carefully directing his atten- 
tion, in their daily walks, to the fossils which 
abounded in the lias rocks underlying the soil 
of his native section of the southern sea coast. 
The rocks " stared rne in the face," he declared 
years after ; " they wooed me, and caressed me, 
saying at every turn, ' Pray be a geologist ! ' 
He could not resist the appeal, especially as his 
inborn proclivities, stimulated by a parent's 
enthusiasm, moved him to the study of the 
earth's antiquity as recorded in libraries of 
mineral and stone. 

At Oxford, which he entered in 1801, the 
same influences were about him, and in his 
early residence he took his first lesson in field

geology, iu a walk to Shotover Hill. The 
stones he brought back from that day's excur- 
sion formed the nucleus of a collection that 
grew, through forty years, into the largest and 
most valuable private store of the kind in Eu- 
rope. The youth took his university degree 
with honors in 1804, and five years after was 
elected a Fellow of Corpus Christi College. 
The same year he was admitted into Holy Or- 
ders. Geology was not then admitted into the 
curriculum at the University, nor recognized 
by many of the grave and reverend teachers as 
worthy the consideration of a Christian being. 
Young Buckland persisted in the study ; and 
as he started on one of his periodical tours of 
research, the devout Dean Gaisford exclaimed 
with satisfaction : " Well, Buckland is gone to 
Italy ; so, thank God, we shall hear no more 
of this geology" 

Neither Buckland nor geology were to be 
suppressed, however, and in 1813 he was made 
Reader of Mineralogy in the University, and in 
1819 was elevated to a full Professorship of 
his beloved subject. He toiled like a hero to 
reduce the chaotic materials at hand into a dis- 
tinct and systematic science, and spent all his 
leisure and money in travels over England and 
Europe to observe and classify fossils and strata 
in situ and in cabinets, and get them arranged 
and mapped out in something like regular and 
comprehensible order. His classes at Oxford 
were well attended, as he possessed uncommon 
tact and talent as a lecturer. Full of ardor, 
of genial good humor, of keen, ready wit, with 
apt powers of description, he kept his audiences 
on every occasion tense with interest in the 
theme he was expounding. Always vivacious, 
merry, and kindly, he was as attractive and 
persuasive in conversation as in a set discourse. 
Says Professor Masqueline : 

" Nothing came amiss to him, from the creation of 
the world to the latest news in town; . . . through all 
intermediate time, he was equally at home. . . . There 
were few subjects which he could not more or less illus- 
trate. In build, look, and manner he was a thorough 
English gentleman, and was appreciated in every circle." 

He was the first to interpret the significance 
of the bone-caves in Europe, and the result of 
his discoveries and theories regarding them was 
published in 1823, in a volume entitled, " Re- 
liquiae Diluvianae," which is still regarded as a 
classic, despite the changes opinion has under- 
gone meantime. The facts treasured in the 
book give it lasting value. 

In 1825 Dr. Buckland was appointed to a 
canonry at Christ Church, and the home he then 
established, by the aid of a partner who was in 



every respect a perfect mate, was renowned for 
its cheerful and charming hospitality. It was 
a scene of delightful order in disorder, where 
the happiest events were sure to be evoked 
from circumstances always picturesque and 
often startling. Mr. Ruskin states, from his 
knowledge of them during his student life, that 
the Doctor, with his wife and family, had " orig- 
inality enough in the sense of them to give sap 
and savor to the whole College. . . . All were 
frank, kind, and clever, vital in the highest 
degree ; to me, medicinal and saving." Another 
writer, telling of the amiable freedom that per- 
vaded the household, which comprised an ex- 
traordinary assemblage of animate and inani- 
mate creatures, relates that 

" Guinea-pigs were often running over the table; and 
occasionally the pony, having trotted down the steps 
from the garden, would push open the dining-room 
door, and career round the table, with three laughing 
children on his back, and then marching through the 
front door, and down the steps, would continue his 
course round Tom Quad." 

There was wise discipline to counteract such 
unusual license, and parents and children pre- 
sent many a wholesome example in their busy 
and lovely home-life. How the seniors of the 
household ever found time to sleep, is a mys- 
tery ; for they appear to have used the night 
as well as the day in diligent reading, writing, 
and study. For example, pondering over the 
fossil footprints on a slab of sandstone, between 
two and three o'clock in the morning, the Doc- 
tor suddenly called up his wife to make a paste, 
while he rushed to bring in a pet tortoise from 
its haunt in the back yard. On his return the 
paste was duly spread over the kitchen table, 
the tortoise placed upon it, and, to the delight 
of the excited couple, the animal traced in the 
plastic dough an exact reproduction of "the foot- 
prints on the sandstone. It was a happy so- 
lution of the problem. 

Their life was a ceaseless round of investi- 
gations and experiments. Even meal-time was 
a period of practical investigation. Lord Play- 
fair recollects various queer dishes of the Doc- 
tor's contriving. " The hedgehog was a suc- 
cessful experiment, and both Liebig and I 
thought it good and tender." A dish of croco- 
dile, on the other hand, proved an utter fail- 
ure. As in a similar attempt with garden 
snails, it was impossible to swallow a mouthful. 
Such incidents were a perpetual spice in the 
life of the Bucklands, and gratefully enliven- 
ing to their guests and friends. 

After a residence of forty-five years at Ox- 
ford, from 1801 to 1845, Canon Bucklaud was

promoted to the Deanery of Westminister. 
Here he infused the same vigor into his ad- 
ministration that had been manifest in all pre- 
vious undertakings, and reforms and amend- 
ments were the rule throughout his new prov- 
ince. There was with him no conflict between 
science and religion. He had faith in their 
fundamental harmony, and both were pursued 
in a consistent, thorough-going manner for the 
benefit of mankind. An insidious disease laid 
its paralysing hand upon him several years be- 
fore his death, quenching his ardor and cutting 
short his usefulness. When, in 1856, at the 
age of seventy-two, his final summons came, 
the earth was poorer for the loss of one who 
had devoted his rich and varied talents to the 
enlightenment and elevation of his fellow-

THE ANTEN^JE ix POETRY.* 



THE PHILISTINE. I don't like Whitman. I like 
either Poetry or Prose when they are 
good. But this is something betwixt and 
between, neither one nor another. I can't 
give it a name. I don't like it. 
THE AMATEUR (is silent). 

If the reader can conceive of Poetry under 
the guise of a member of the sub-order Hy- 
menoptera, he will be able to begin this article 
without trouble. The comparison is possibly 
a quaint one, but it is not wholly out of the 
way. I read of the Hymenoptera, that " the 
mouth-parts are well developed both for biting 
and feeding on the sweets of plants, the ligula 
especially, used in lapping nectar, being greatly 
developed." The wings are said to be " adapted 
for powefful and long-sustained flight," which 
is very well, although some people who write 
poetry are like some exceptional members of 
the Hymenoptera and have no wings at all. It 
is also said of this sub-order or I sometimes 
hear of it as an order that " they have very 
large heads [which seems to me character- 
istic], with large compound eyes and three 
ocelli." Some of them have stings. So if the 
muse of Poetry should ask me what costume to 
wear to the fancy ball, I should say, " Go as 
one of the higher and more typical forms of 
Hymenoptera."

Interesting as are the wings and the mandi- 
bles, and the nectar-lapping ligula, I find more 
present interest in the antennae. The antenna} 
are the sort of feelers that a Hymenopteron 
sticks out in front of himself, to see where he 
is going, to experiment, to investigate, to bring 
himself into relation with things lying a bit be- 
yond his particular sphere. They fulfil a very 
useful function, for Poetry or indeed for any 
kind of art, being always on the look-out for 
things that are new and edifying and amusing. 

" Vistas," by Mr. William Sharp, is then an 
experiment, or a series of experiments. When 
Mr. Aldrich asked the author what his aim was 
in writing such things, what was the purpose 
he would realize, Mr. Sharp found it exceed- 
ingly difficult to make a definite answer ; and the 
reader will perhaps pardon me if I am not abso- 
lutely categorical either. 

It is, however, obvious that we have here 
new modes of conceiving things and new means 
of expression. The eleven pieces which make 
up " Vistas " are of the nature of reveries, of 
visions which have been given as clear a form 
as could well be. Questionings as to the mys- 
tery of life, passionate struggles of love, brood- 
ings on the origin of sin and its influence upon 
this life and that which is to come, imaginations 
concerning the life but just beyond the grave, 
a playing on the chords where love and death 
are bound together, such things as these have 
taken form and are presented to us in these dra- 
matic interludes. Now, since these matters are 
of course by no means extraordinary topics, 
the experimentary character lies in the mode 
of their conception, or, perhaps more properly, 
of their presentation. They are not conceived 
in any approach to the classic manner, but in 
a manner ultra romantic. For although the 
main emotion is always present before us, it is 
not presented simply, but always by means of 
a multitude of extremely fine and delicate 
nuances. Indefinite hopes and fears, presen- 
timents, imaginings of spiritual accompani- 
ment, premonitions almost occult, faint rip- 
plings of emotion, the little wavelets that skim 
over the waves of passion, it is in such forms 
that Mr. Sharp conceives his subjects and in 
such forms that he presents them to us. To me 
it seems that he is remarkably successful in 
communicating to us the emotion that he has 
it at heart to give : the touches are slight, but 
the effect is cumulative. Somewhat new as is 
his mode of expression, the means of expres- 
sion is also an experiment. The " dramatic in- 
terlude " is what Mr. Sharp calls it. Here I

must confess I do not think him so successful. 
Most dramatic pieces convey their impression 
chiefly by the speeches of the characters. So 
do some here. But others have much more 
stage direction. " The Passion of Pere Hila- 
rion " consists chiefly of narrative and descrip- 
tive passages, with one long dialogue in the 
middle. " The Lute Player " has hardly a hint 
of dramatic form, except for being printed in 
two kinds of type. It is at least an extension 
of the usual conception of the word "dramatic " 
to apply it to such work. It may be pictorial, 
but it is hardly dramatic. It is possibly very 
Philistine, but it has seemed to me in reading 
several of the pieces that the chief thing dra- 
matic about them is the manner of printing. 
I should like to see a copy printed with the 
stage direction in large print and the speeches 
not given each a line to itself. This would do 
much to take away the dramatic character 
which they seem to possess in the mind of the 
author. They would then be seen to be mostly 
prose phantasies, not very different in structure 
from a good deal of De Quincey. 

It seems to have been hinted that Mr. Sharp 
is an imitator of M. Maeterlinck. There is 
certainly a superficial resemblance between the 
two which lies largely in the fact that both use 
a dramatic form, both have a very pictorial way 
of conceiving things, both have a certain studied 
simplicity of diction, both endeavor earnestly 
to give an indefinite sort of toning to every sit- 
uation. But in some important respects they 
are certainly very different. In the power of 
conceiving and presenting character, M. Mae- 
terlinck is immensely the superior. Mr. Sharp 
presents situations vividly enough, but such 
characters as he presents vanish from the mind 
almost before they enter it. In " The Coming 
of the Prince" and "A Northern Night "the two 
pairs of lovers are merely two pairs of lovers, 
and not four people. M. Maeterlinck, on the 
other hand, discriminates very delicately. The 
King in " The Princess Maleine " is very dif- 
ferent from the King in " The Seven Sisters," 
and both differ from the King in " Pelleas and 
Melisande." As to the value of the characters, 
opinions may differ ; but the power of conceiv- 
ing and drawing is conspicuous. 

This means, to my mind, that M. Maeter- 
linck is a true dramatist. Eccentric in many 
of his ideas, he undoubtedly creates persons 
and sets them in relation to each other. It 
seems, rather, as though he then left them to 
pursue their own devices. Some of his plays 
have a very definite scheme and structure, but 



others seem extremely incoherent. Still, the 
reader is carried along, even though he may not 
always be sure whither or why. M. Maeter- 
linck has evidently no such definite elements of 
subject-matter as has Mr. Sharp. The atmos- 
phere of the two is entirely different. Mr. 
Sharp's world is sensuous (one may be allowed 
to suggest that it is somewhat improper), full 
of the delight of color and odor, glowing and 
throbbing with life. M. Maeterlinck's is low- 
toned, troubled, generally of a malefic green 
tone. His characters are always in gloomy and 
awe-inspiring places (the weight of evil seems 
brooding over everything), but they never 
seem to have any understanding of their rela- 
tion to their surroundings. One feels that if 
any one of the characters could make a violent 
effort he might wake from the nightmare and 
have no more to do with it. 

Of Maeterlinck there is much more to be 
said. It was a pity that anyone called him the 
Belgian Shakespeare, and also that everyone 
bothers about his symbolism. But these mat- 
ters, and many others, I must leave on one 
side. It may be remarked that Mr. Hovey's 
translation is very much better than Mr. 
Winslow's. But both give a good idea of the 
original. 

Such work as this, and as Mr. Sharp's, is at 
once a challenge and a stimulus, and as such, 
one is glad to receive it. A certain artist, in 
writing of landscape painting, remarked, " To 
this sort of man [the Philistine] it does not 
seem possible that Monet or Pizzarro can seri- 
ously think that their pictures in any way sug- 
gest nature. Goliath is quite convinced that 
they paint in that manner from perversity, 
chiefly to irritate him." So with Mr. Sharp 
and M. Maeterlinck. But we must not think 
thus. There have been those who wrote strange 
things merely to astonish and bewilder and irri- 
tate the ordinary person. But the work of these 
men has too much to it to be that kind of thing. 
It is the work of men who are striving to ex- 
tend our power of feeling and of expression ; 
and as such, one welcomes it gladly, and tries 
to gain its secret and its method.

ANSELME MATHIEU, a Provencal poet, and the friend 
and associate of Fre'de'ric Mistral, died recently at 
Avignon, at the age of seventy. He was one of the

THE STORY OF DEAN CHURCH'S IJFE.* 

" A book of letters rather than a complete 
biography," such is the modest claim made by 
the editor of the "Life and Letters of Dean 
Church." We think the reader's verdict will 
be that a book of letters thus edited comes 
quite near enough to a complete biography. 
Certainly the best biographies in our language 
are little more than well-edited correspondence, 
or, as in the case of " Boswell's Johnson," notes 
of familiar conversation ; and nothing is so like 
good talk as a good letter. Whatever Miss 
Church's own work might seem to lack is abund- 
antly supplied by Dean Paget's Preface and 
Canon Scott-Holland's brilliant estimate. "The 
letters," writes the Dean, "tell the story of their 
writer's life ; what he was in the depth of char- 
acter and personality, must be left untold." 
Doubtless all that close friends saw in Dean 
Church cannot be told, but " the distinctive 
notes of his mind and work " are clearly and 
sufficiently indicated in this very attractive 
volume. 

The person thus outlined before us proves 
to be well worth considering. It was said of 
him, on his election as Fellow of Oriel, that 
" there is such moral beauty about Church that 
they could not help taking him "; and that 
seemed the general judgment among those who 
knew him when Gladstone drew him from his 
rural retirement and made him Dean of St. 
Paul's. It is what you feel in all his writings 
the moral beauty of the man, a measure and 
charm which are no tricks of a well-trained pen, 
but the natural outcome of character. It is not 
the beauty of flexible weakness, but of polished 
strength ; the beauty not of a fragile carving 
but of a columnar shaft finely proportioned to 
bear its burden to the best advantage. Large 
intelligence, thorough scholarship, rare and del- 
icate taste, simple and earnest devotion, were all 
combined with a certain judicial poise, a just 
measure in thought and conduct. The friend 
and disciple of Newman and Pusey, he was the 
partisan of neither, and could recognize the 
worth of Arnold and the chivalry of Stanley. 
He was himself of weight oftener by a certain 
unconscious influence than by any direct effort. 
His character acted as a force. Holding him- 
self apart in a certain wise reserve, he the more 
thoroughly affected the judgment and conduct of 

his fellows. It was less what he said than what

he did not say that checked and repressed them. 
His silences were speeches ; his suppressions 
were verdicts. Wisely bold at need, he had no 
love of figuring at the front of the stage. He had 
greatness thrust upon him. He could be gen- 
erous and expect no recognition. You cannot 
think of his taking an unfair advantage or at- 
tempting to hold untenable ground. He knew 
how to handle hot coals without fanning them 
into a blaze. He could write history from one 
side of a controverted position, and remain im- 
partial just to opponents, and no more than 
just to friends. 

Miss Church has caught her father's mood. 
No line of hers can embitter controversy. She 
has set forth the moral beauty, the placid wis- 
dom, the sweet temper, of her father's life ; has 
measured fairly his relative importance in his 
time, and has kept her story within moderate 
bounds which is something that sufferers from 
some recent biographies may well be grateful 
for. She nowhere errs by exaggeration or ex- 
cess. You feel that she loved her father too 
well to risk an over-estimate of his place in his- 
tory ; that she knew too well his refined taste, 
his sober judgment, his native modesty of spirit, 
to jar them even in the grave.

CHAPTERS OF POPULAR SCIENCE.* 



Popular lectures on scientific subjects, by 
competent men, are much too rare. Especially 
is this true in the department of physics. Such 
lectures used to be more common. Faraday 
and Tyndall and Tait have given us some in 
English, and Helmholtz's lectures have been 
well known for years. It appears that there 
has grown up lately the notion that people can- 
not be made to understand physical matters 
unless they have been well disciplined in math- 
ematics and in the physical manipulations of a 
laboratory. That physical subjects should be 
instructive as well as entertaining, it is need- 
ful that the lecturer should have somewhat 
wide sympathies and know how to meet his 
hearers half way. The exclusive devotion to 
the laboratory aspect of a subject is not con- 
ducive to exposition nor even to the understand- 
ing of the subject itself in a large way. Truth 
for truth's sake is good, but truth for human- 
ity's sake is better ; and every effort toward a

popular presentation of the interesting matters 
of science is to be commended. 

Professor Mach, of the University of Prague, 
is a master in physics, so much so that he sees 
as few others do that some of our fundamental 
conceptions and phraseology need attention 
even more than fresh experimental results, as 
his recent book on " Mechanics " shows ; a book, 
by the way, that I heartily wish every teacher 
of physics would read and digest. These " Pop- 
ular Lectures " treat of various subjects, such 
as " The Forms of Liquids," ' The Causes of 
Harmony," " The Velocity of Light," " The 
Principle of the Conservation of Energy," in a 
way easy to apprehend by persons who have 
had no special training in physics. There are 
others on more recondite subjects. The lec- 
ture on " The Fundamental Concepts of Elec- 
trostatics " is interesting and helpful to every- 
one, however familiar with the subject, for it 
is much simplified by the treatment. 

The last three or four chapters rise into phil- 
osophy, and in them the relationships that phys- 
ics bear to other lines of thought and human 
interest are treated. The one on " Mental 
Adaptation " is excellent, for it calls attention 
to the necessity for ideality in science. We 
have been so busy gathering the facts of sci- 
ence, that but little attention has been given 
to their signification, and many scientific men 
have come as far short in their judgments of 
men and of things as have any of those who 
knew nothing of science. In the teaching of 
physics it is assumed generally that one must 
become familiar with a great number of facts 
before he can be permitted to generalize at all. 
Professor Mach says substantially that it is not 
needful to know very much that is, many 
details of a subject in order to understand 
fundamental principles. If this idea were gen- 
eral, it would make much difference in the 
amount and kind of instruction given in schools 
of all grades. 

Finally, the lecturer takes a hand in the old 
controversy about the curriculum, and speaks 
as one familiar with the data on both sides of 
the question as to the relative value of classical 
and scientific educations. 

Altogether the book is a good one, and will 
serve a good purpose, both for instruction and 
suggestion. The translation, by Mr. T. J. Mc- 
Cormack, is well done ; and the Open Court 
Company has put the work into a very present- 
able volume of three hundred pages.

SOME RECENT BOOKS ON SOCIAL, 
SUBJECTS.* 



In this article we give a suggestion of the con- 
tents and points of view of a dozen or more writers 
who start from very different grounds. Five of 
these relate to some phase of socialism ; one to the 
social management of dependents and defectives ; 
and the others to special problems or local interests. 

Professor Flint's work on Socialism grew out of 
a course of lectures to workingmen, and some arti- 
cles in " Good Words." The style is clear, strong, 
and popular. The author is a distinguished writer 
on philosophy, and the teaching of economics in 
earlier years made him familiar with the elements 
of this discipline. The first chapters offer a survey 
of the historical phases of socialism and State inter- 
vention. Some of the most important documents 
of recent theories are printed, and references to re- 
cent discussions are frequent. The doctrines of 
Marx are somewhat fully analyzed. The relations 
of socialism to labor, capital, land, social organiza- 
tion, democracy, morality, and religion are discussed 
in other chapters. The standpoint is that of ortho- 
dox political economy, and M. Leroy-Beaulieu is 
quoted as a favorite interpreter. Socialism is de- 
fined as " any theory of social organization which 
sacrifices the legitimate liberties of individuals to 
the will or interests of the community." Pure in- 
dividualism is repudiated as the opposite extreme. 
The fundamental doctrines of Marx are regarded 
as " a mass of congealed fallacies." Labor is not 
the sole origin of wealth. Capital and direction are 
essential factors in progressive industry, and they 
are entitled to a share of the product. It is pre-

posterous to seek a measure of wages in a mere time 
standard. Mr. George's half-way socialism is re- 
jected. The author once believed in the absorption 
by society of the " unearned increment," but now 
accompanies Mr. Spencer in abandoning the doc- 
trine. The government that should attempt to man- 
age all industrial enterprises would break down 
under the weight of administration. Democracy 
organized in socialism would perish under the hands 
of a corrupt element. Democracy can exist only as 
it reverences ability and moral greatness, while so- 
cialism would debase life with its materialistic ethics. 
The fundamental error and evil in current social- 
ism is its denial of the true grounds of morality. It 
is a Hegelian dialectic, with matter in place of idea 
as creative force. Circumstances are said to deter- 
mine life, and character is effect and not cause of 
prosperity. There is a one-sided emphasis on econ- 
omic forces. Duties to God are ignored. Personal 
morality is sacrificed to society, and the individual 
is not esteemed as an end in himself, but is looked 
upon as an atom or organ in a great Leviathan. It 
is admitted that not all socialists are thus commit- 
ted to an agnostic and unethical view of the world, 
but the dominant forces move in this direction. 
What the world has called theft they re-christen 
justice. Their opposition to war and class oppres- 
sion is recognized as worthy of praise, but their con- 
stant and general appeals to class hatreds tend to 
produce the worst of all wars, that of citizens against 
each other. As to the attitude of the Church, the 
author declares that it has no political or economi- 
cal programme. The Church can do its work under 
any form of government or industrial organization. 
If socialism succeeds, profound changes would come, 
but religion would find its best form of expression. 
Of course, with the immoral and irreligious dog- 
mas of socialism, the Church is forced into an atti- 
tude of uncompromising antagonism. Whatever 
measures the socialists propose for the true amelio- 
ration of mankind should find in the Church hearty 
support. The function of the preacher is judiciously 
distinguished from that of editor, statesman, and 
economist. " The power of the State, just because 
the more extended and superficial, may seem the 
greater, but is really the lesser. Spiritual force is 
mightier than material force." The Church can well 
afford to be content with the use of the primary and 
highest motives of conduct. 

The object of Professor Nicholson's vigorous at- 
tack on Socialism is to " test the ideal by the real, 
the possible future by the actual past." Altruism has 
not yet come to the dominating position assigned 
to it in Kidd's " Social Evolution " and Drummond's 
"Ascent of Man." The standing armies of Europe 
and the recent railroad strikes in America are evi- 
dences that the old Adam of egoism must be con- 
sidered in our calculations of the possible. Yet in- 
dustrial progress is not due to a mere struggle for 
existence, and must be accounted for by consider- 
ing characteristic human qualities. Biological an- 



alogies are misleading, since economic advance is 
due to " the suppression of those animal instincts 
and the substitution for them of propensities and 
practices peculiar to man," to invention, language, 
and free contract. Socialism is condemned by his- 
tory because it involves ruinous taxation, abolition 
of exchange, the suppression of liberty, security, and 
private property. The State is not a good instru- 
ment for the management of capital and the regu- 
lation of income. Short of socialism, governmental 
agencies may do much to promote self-help. " The 
growth of knowledge and industry opens up new 
possibilities for the beneficial action of the State and 
the municipalities, and even imposes on them new 
duties." The classic political economists are de- 
fended from the charge of ignoring social sympathies 
and the beneficent activity of the State. One does 
not find here, however, any statement of a princi- 
ple of inclusion and exclusion in respect to State 
functions. 

" Three Months in a Workshop " is a remark- 
able account of a singular experience. Paul Gohre, 
a young divinity graduate, wished to learn at first 
hand the facts about the life of German working- 
men. He entered a machine shop in Saxony, 
worked eleven hours a day as a common laborer, 
conversed with the men, attended socialistic meet- 
ings, and went to the places of amusement. His 
study has produced a deep impression in Germany, 
and the author has been made Secretary of the Evan- 
gelical Social Congress. Deep and extreme want 
he did not find. The worst feature of the material 
condition was the inhuman crowding of dwellings. 
Low wages compels the larger families to take in 
boarders. Practical communism takes the place of 
separate family life. Socialistic philosophy is nat- 
ural to those who are thus compelled to live in com- 
mon. Food and dress are suitable and sufficient, 
and excessive drinking is not common. " The use 
of domestic beer at seven pfennigs the bottle was 
constantly on the increase, and more and more took 
the place of brandy drinking. The chief cause of 
this change is the invention of the familiar patent 
cork ; and the workman who formerly bad his 
brandy flask in his pocket now carries an equally 
transportable bottle of beer. So a small technical 
invention becomes a great social and ethical influ- 
ence, and accomplishes more than many sermons 
and efforts at reform." The technical processes in 
the factory are described in detail : the military or- 
ganization, social classifications, moral effects of in- 
terior arrangements, and the material environment. 
There is a vivid picture of socialistic agitation, and 
of the educational, religious, and moral habits of the 
laboring people. The author finds that the labor 
question is not merely a stomach or wage question, 
but an educational and religious question of the first 
importance. There is an ardent longing for more re- 
spect and recognition, for larger share in the knowl- 
edge and culture of the age. Social democracy is the 
mouthpiece of the labor movement .in Germany.

" No liberal trades unions, no young men's Christian 
associations, no evangelical working-men's unions, 
can stem this process of evolution." Social democracy 
may be directed, elevated, regenerated, but cannot 
be destroyed. What the government can do to alle- 
viate their lot should be attempted with their good- 
will, and after consulting them, not in the way of 
lofty patronage by the " upper " classes. What the 
Church can do must follow the same principle. So- 
cial democracy is now closely bound up with materi- 
alism. Its philosophy of life is narrow and de- 
grading. If learned professors and pastors have a 
higher view of life they must descend from their 
pedestals and mingle with the people, in order to 
diffuse the culture for which many of the socialists 
are really hungry. Parish work must be organized 
to cover all the territory and touch all the social 
needs of each community. The Social Congress 
must awaken and direct the interest of educated 
men and women, so that they will learn how to come 
in contact with the democracy, educate the working 
classes, and inspire them with higher ideals of life. 
The translation of this work is smooth and clear, 
and great care has been taken to render technical 
terms as accurately as possible. Professor Ely has 
taken great pains to have the work thoroughly done, 
and his Introduction indicates the place of the book 
in current discussion. 

The Rev. S. A. Barnett and his wife have lived in 
the classic region of poverty, face to face with the 
pathetic reality, and have maintained high ideals of 
a beautiful human life. This second edition of their 
" Practicable Socialism," an already famous work, 
has an Introduction which gives a " twenty years' 
retrospect." In one of the essays, long before the 
Dockers' strike, they had pleaded for the organiza- 
tion of the undisciplined mob who fought each other 
for an odd job at the wharf gates. Now they can 
say, " It is satisfactory that dock labor is organized." 
Other objects of their social effort have been gained. 
" Workmen are eligible as guardians, houses have 
been built fit for habitation, free libraries, open 
spaces, and baths have been opened, the poor-law 
administration has been made more humane, public 
opinion against impurity is strengthened, some of 
the restrictions imposed by a narrow code on chil- 
dren's education have been removed, twenty thou- 
sand or thirty thousand children spend their holi- 
days in the country, the status of young servants 
has been raised, the People's Palace and polytech- 
nics have been provided, universal pensions and 
agricultural training farms are within the range of 
practical politics, the offer of the best the best 
pictures, the best music to all is not so unusual, 
the entertainment of the poor as equals is not so 
uncommon, and university settlements have been 
started." But work remains to be done. " There 
has been no attempt to fit the Church for its work." 
Dishonesty, gambling, and impertinence have in- 
creased. Dole charity is still expected to relieve 
the poor, whereas the chief aid must come from so- 



cialized effort to " make poor neighborhoods as clean, 
as healthy, as well provided with means of study, 
cleanliness, and play, as rich neighborhoods. These 
things stimulate and do not paralyze energy." The 
criticism of Chicago life, after a visit here, deserves 
serious reflection. The pages are crowded with 
practical suggestions of ways in which philanthro- 
pists can study, help, and humanize the life of the 
poor : but on one condition that they live with the 
poor, and know them personally and in natural re- 
lations, as Mr. and Mrs. Barnett know them. 

The writer of " Towards Utopia " resolutely re- 
fuses to attempt to wade an ocean or walk to the 
moon. He insists that we can take but one step at 
a time. Experience, however, tells us at a given 
moment the wisest direction for the step. We should 
begin at home and relieve the burdens of the ser- 
vant girls. These modern helpers of domestic life 
have breathed the air of democracy. They are half- 
conscious of the vast change which all society has 
undergone. They resent badges of inferiority, and 
their assertion of womanhood in curious and trying 
ways must be met by a frank and honest adaptation 
to the fact of democracy. The illustrations of waste 
of food, clothing, time, strength, and even of cigar 
ashes and stumps, are very interesting. The author 
does not seem to be aware of the difficulties of mak- 
ing the sewage of cities into fertilizers in such a 
place as London or New York. The criticism of 
lingering caste spirit and caste immoralities is search- 
ing and caustic. The epithets sometimes come close 
to billingsgate idioms, but the level of view is high 
enough. The chief value of the book lies in its 
specific examples of the vices of the rich and lux- 
urious, and of many who regard themselves as very 
patterns of goodness. Few persons can read the 
pages without being startled and made to wince 
under the keen discernment of the lines. Possibly 
some of the proposed reforms are not practicable, 
and not " towards Utopia," but the exposure of fol- 
lies and wrongs is wholesome. The author's agnos- 
ticism, his despair of immortality, and certain other 
very gloomy vistas of life, will be judged by each 
reader according to his own life philosophy. It is 
only fair to notify the reader that such views are 
in the book. But the tendency of the work must 
be to make believers in democracy and Christianity 
both live up to their creed, or be uncomfortable 
with their consciences if they refuse. 

Mr. Kelley's teaching, in "The Law of Service," 
is that the ethical law of life is the law of the ut- 
most possible service. Whatever may be in ques- 
tion, this is certainly of the essence of Christianity. 
The Church has always recognized the law, but its 
view has been obstructed by egoistic and introspec- 
tive habits of mind. Sermons fall short of their 
full force, because they teach too little aud pass over 
difficult duties with commonplaces. " The feeble- 
ness and inconsequence of the average prayer-meet- 
ing need only be mentioned. The inefficiency of the 
Sunday School is monumental." Selfishness rules

our social life, and vulgar ostentation desecrates 
even the sanctuary. The rich and the poor do not 
meet on fraternal terms in the house of God. Du- 
ties to dumb animals hardly find place in religious 
instruction. Business and politics become corrupt 
because they are divorced from religion. Art, fallen 
from the law of human service, pursued for its own 
sake, ministering only to the rich, becomes de- 
graded ; only under the law of utmost service can 
it become noble and enduring. Art is a slave when 
it serves mere luxury. Literature becomes worthy, 
in journalism and books, only as it is altruistic. Col- 
leges and universities used simply for the conven- 
ience of a class, and given over to research without 
teaching, are checked in their development. The 
writer is a believer in Christianity, and his criti- 
cism is intended to be the wound of a friend. It 
has something of the faithful searching quality of 
the old Covenanters. 

" American Charities " is a welcome volume, the 
ripe fruit of scientific study and of the author's expe- 
rience as a superintendent of charities, and it deserves 
special notice. It presents the select results of the 
discussions of the specialists who form the National 
Conference of Charities and Corrections, fused into 
one logical whole by long reflection. The field of 
view is indicated by the title. The social treatment 
of the criminal is only incidentally touched. Atten- 
tion is concentrated upon the almshouse, out-door 
relief, the unemployed dependent children, the des- 
titute sick, the insane and feeble-minded. A care- 
ful review of the causes of poverty and degenera- 
tion, personal and social, illustrates the great value 
of statistics in social inquiry. Under the topic " Phil- 
anthropic Financiering " the author discusses public 
and private charities, endowments, and public subsi- 
dies to private charities. He has studied Chicago char- 
ities, and finds them chaotic and full of grave abuses, 
due to absence of charity organization. The list of 
books cited, and a full index, make the work con- 
venient for reference. The style is sober, yet inter- 
esting, and the attacks on wrongs of administration 
are frequently shrewd and incisive. It is the best 
work available for its purpose. The luminous ac- 
count of the objects, methods, and machinery of 
charity organization would of itself give a high place 
to the discussion. 

Mr. Tolman's book on " Municipal Reform Move- 
ments in the United States " is a timely and perti- 
nent publication. The author's association with Dr. 
Parkhurst in the City Vigilance League of New 
York has given him exceptional means of studying 
the new movements and methods of municipal re- 
form. Dr. Parkhurst furnishes a suggestive intro- 
duction to his work. Part I. discusses the " Civic 
Renaissance," and lays down the ethical principles 
and social forces of the movement. Here are dis- 
cussed the functions of the city, the causes of the 
awakening and of encouragement, and the way to 
utilize the victory. In Part II. we have eighty-four 
pages devoted to an account of the municipal re- 



form movement in the leading cities and large towns 
of the United States. In Part III. the author gives 
the names and principles of the educational organ- 
izations. In Part IV. we have an exhibition of the 
increased activities of women in promoting civic 
righteousness. In Part V. the City Vigilance League 
is treated as the typical organization of the United 
States for municipal progress, and a more detailed 
explanation is offered of its origin and methods. 
In a volume of a little over two hundred pages we 
have a fairly complete story of the present state of 
the effort in this country. The materials for plans 
of organization are here supplied in a most conven- 
ient form. 

The study of " Un-American Immigration " is 
based on the census of 1890. It is an argument 
against free immigration of foreigners, rather than 
an investigation. The conclusions reached relate 
to a law regulating the subject : it should be gen- 
eral and not special, excluding the unfit but admit- 
ting others without distinction of race ; illiterate im- 
migrants should be excluded ; each one must have 
money for his support for at least six months ; crim- 
inals and paupers should be deported at the cost 
of the transporting company ; immigrants must de- 
clare their intention in respect to naturalization, and 
only those naturalized should vote ; the law should 
be enforced by officers free from bias. To enforce 
these recommendations, the influence of immigra- 
tion on crime, pauperism, illiteracy, and corrupt pol- 
itics, is traced. The statement made on page 56, 
in respect to the apparent increase of crime, is mis- 
leading, as Mr. F. H. Wines has pointed out. The 
suggestion that child labor is due to immigration 
alone leaves out of account the universal effect of 
factory organization in the absence of rigid legisla- 
tive control. The collection of statistics will be 
found convenient, and the general effect of the dis- 
cussion ought to be helpful. 

A very depressing picture of social conditions in 
the South is that drawn by Mr. Otken. There is 
a description of the desolations of the Civil War, 
the consequent poverty of the whites, the suspicion 
and hate of the blacks, the heavy taxation imposed 
by the carpet-bag governments. The author tells 
of a merchant class which is growing rich out of 
the farmers, but he does not seem to explain the 
abundant supply of blood for so many leeches. 
Then he reveals the cause of the ruin of the far- 
mers, by telling us that they keep no accounts, have 
no idea what compound interest means, and insist 
on impoverishing their land by excessive growth of 
one kind of crop. He insists on the obsolete method 
of computing ante-bellum wealth by adding the 
market value of slaves. He declares that the negro 
is a hopeless failure. Education is wasted on him. 
He will not work regularly, but he will lie and 
steal. In both North and South he eats more than 
his share of penitentiary bread. The only hope of 
the South is in transporting the whole race to Af- 
rica. But the author himself suggests here and

there the outlines of a more humane and practicable 
policy. What certain industrial schools have done 
for some of the blacks, they can do for all. Some- 
thing more is required than the " Three R's," and 
this by the poor whites as well as by the blacks. 
The difficulties are intellectual and moral, and there- 
fore can be overcome by changes within human 
power. The case is a hard one ; but the writer 
gracefully shows that Northern philanthropy and 
Southern self-help have already removed many ob- 
stacles to the splendid future which a great and 
noble and brave people ought to expect for them- 
selves. The book gives many statistics with illus- 
trative examples, but the presentation is too pes- 
simistic to be complete. 

"Young West" is a sequel to Bellamy's "Look- 
ing Backward," another castle in the air. One can 
imagine anything which can be constructed out of 
mundane materials. Plato in picturing an ideal 
Republic, More in giving us his fancy of Utopia, 
John the Seer in presenting the New Jerusalem, 
must employ the materials furnished by actual life. 
This author cannot escape from the nineteenth cen- 
tury, and the attempt to do so is amusing. Telephones 
are somewhat improved ; aluminum is so cheap and 
plentiful that columns and beams are made of it ; 
glass is substituted for stone ; but there is no new 
machine, no new law. Romancers must wait for 
men of science and invention. Some of the social 
changes expected by socialists are promised : an 
eight-hour day, and all working ; women serving 
their time in the industrial army ; bad tempers are 
cured by mesmerism, and electrified water is used 
for a disinfectant ; volapiik is the universal language ; 
family affection is pale and feeble ; death is with- 
out a pang and without a hope ; in a funeral dis- 
course, God is not hinted at; Vedas, Koran, and 
Bible are all put on a forgotten shelf, for reasons 
which would consign much of Shakespeare, Dante, 
Tennyson, and all the rest, to oblivion ; hope of 
immortality perishes, because the earth has become 
so comfortable for all ; children are brought up by 
state officers, and so bereavement of families falls 
lightly. The outlook is that in Tennyson's picture 
of the despairing agnostic, " love and die." One 
can hardly tell whether the work is interpretation 
of materialistic communism or its caricature. 

In " Social Growth and Stability " the author's 
purpose is "to promote a better understanding in 
regard to men's relations to one another, and to 
stimulate increased effort in behalf of the unfor- 
tunate wage-earners." He has had business expe- 
rience in manufacturing during thirty years, and 
writes a series of brief reflections, in pleasing 
popular form, on the measures which he believes 
would promote social welfare. He favors protec- 
tive tariff, an eight-hour day, restriction of immi- 
gration, regulation of trusts, and compulsory edu- 
cation. 

After stating the nature and causes of friction 
and unrest in industrial relations, the author of " The 



Rights of Labor " proposes a remedy : " Fix by 
statute a maximum per cent profit upon capital in- 
vested. . . . Declare by statute that all profits real- 
ized from any enterprise, after expenses and the 
per cent allowed to those contributing money or 
property, be divided among those who do personal 
service in the factory or other industry." 

These books may be taken as indications of the 
intense and general interest in social questions, and 
some of them are real contributions toward pro- 
gress of thought and action. This article attempts 
to give means for the foundation of an independent 
judgment of their relative value, so far as the limits 
of space permit. C- R> HENDERSON.

and his opinions are always put with 
a pungency that arrests the attention. The verbal 
tricks by which this effect is secured are often far 
from admirable, and the opinions themselves some- 
times display an indiosyncrasy as far as possible 
removed fr< m what is sane and veracious. In his 
recent volume of " Corrected Impressions" (Dodd), 
for example, he is capable of describing George 
Eliot's fame as " almost utterly vanished away," and 
of saying that Matthew Arnold's "Literature and 
Dogma " is " now abandoned to cheap beginners in 
undogmatism alike by the orthodox and the unor- 
thodox of some mental calibre." Such amazing 
judgments as these do not inspire confidence, and 
yet there is no little criticism of a really valuable 
sort in the volume from which we have taken them. 
In a series of brief papers on Thackeray, Tenny- 
son, Carlyle, Macaulay, Browning, Dickens, Ar- 
nold, Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Swinburne, and Mr. William 
Morris, the author has given us " a kind of fore- 
shortened review of the impressions, and the correc- 
tions of them, which the great Victorian writers " 
have made at different times upon a reader of 
thirty years' standing. The personal note in these 
essays gives them their main attractiveness, and is 
obtruded in many places. Some incautious critic 
has said, for example, that Dickens's "Agnes is 
perhaps the most charming character in the whole 
range of fiction." Most sympathies will be with 
Mr. Saintsbury's outburst: "Agnes! No decent 
violence of expletive, no reasonable artifice of 
typography, could express the depths of my feel- 
ings at such a suggestion." The paper on Mr. 
Swinburne is particularly appreciative and enjoy- 
able, although anything but adequate. This bit 
about the poet's parodists is simply delicious : " Mr. 
Swinburne, like other poets on the right side of the 
line, is not imitable, at any rate, he has not been 
imitated. They have gotten his fiddle, but not his 
rosin, they can pile on alliteration, and be biblical 
in phrase, and trench on things forbidden in sub-

Mr. Frederic Harrison has collected 

Historical essays by i_ t i i 

Frederic Harrison, seventeen papers upon historical sub- 
jects into a volume entitled " The 
Meaning of History, and Other Historical Pieces " 
(Macmillan). Most of the papers have appeared 
in English or American reviews during the past ten 
years, but they are of sufficient value to be welcome 
in book form. Indeed, the brilliant and forceful 
style of Mr. Harrison, his knowledge and grasp, his 
subordination of details to general principles, fit him 
as few are fitted to set forth the educational value 
of history and to arouse enthusiasm in the pursuit 
of historical studies. There are not many writers, 
for example, who could make so clear, so sound, 
and so penetrating a survey of universal history as 
is embodied in the second of these essays, "The 
Connection of History." Nor are there many who 
could set forth " The Use of History " as eloquently 
as it is done in the opening chapter of the volume. 
The chapter on " Some Great Books of History " 
is as helpful to the beginner or the general reader 
as the author's familiar essay on " The Choice of 
Books," and its leading ideas are even sounder. 
Other chapters of the present volume include the 
delightful dialogue on " The History Schools, " in 
which adherents of Freeman and Froude argue, each 
for his favorite master ; the somewhat overdone skit 
on " Palaeographic Purism," which really needs its 
" Nineteenth Century " antidote ; the plea for " The 
Sacredness of Ancient Buildings," a masterly " Sur- 
vey of the Thirteenth Century," and two papers on 
the France of the Revolution and the France of to- 
day. The essays that we have thus far enumerated 
make up about one-half of Mr. Harrison's volume. 
The other half is devoted to a group of studies of 
the great cities that have so largely influenced and 
shaped European history studies of Athens, Rome, 
Constantinople, Paris, and London. Introductory 
to this group of special studies is the essay on " The 
City : Ancient Mediaeval Modern Ideal." 
We cannot promise readers of this volume that the 
author will always compel them to agree with him, 
but we can safely promise them intellectual stimu- 
lation and pleasure in its perusal. 

Messrs. Stone & Kimball have dis- 
played commendable enterprise in 
securing for publication " The Ama- 
teur Emigrant," which is Robert Louis Stevenson's 
account of his experiences upon his famous trip to 
the United States as a second cabin or steerage 
passenger. His subsequent adventures, on the way 
to California with an emigrant train, have already 
been publicly told in the volume entitled "Across 
the Plains." The posthumous book is one of the

best examples of Stevenson's exquisitely finished 
prose composition, and the reader will do well not 
to let a single word escape him. The little volume 
is packed full of sanity and wholesome views of 
life. Pregnant passages, such as the following, 
abound : " One thing, indeed, is not to be learned in 
Scotland, and that is the way to be happy. Yet 
that is the whole of culture, and perhaps two- 
thirds of morality. Can it be that the Puritan 
school, by divorcing a man from nature, by thin- 
ning out his instincts, and setting a stamp of its 
disapproval on whole fields of human activity and 
interest, leads at last directly to material greed?" 
An amusing story is told of the ship's purser, who, 
learning that his passenger was a writer, " touched 
to the heart by my misguided industry, offered me 
some other kind of writing, ' for which,' he added 
pointedly, ' you will be paid.' This was nothing 
else than to copy out the list of passengers." There 
is no more truthful touch in the whole volume than 
the description, so familiar to every ocean voyager, 
of the occasional excursions made by cabin passen- 
gers into the steerage. " It was astonishing what 
insults these people managed to convey by their 
presence. They seemed to throw their clothes in 
our faces. Their eyes searched us all over for 
tatters and incongruities. A laugh was ready at 
their lips ; but they were too well-mannered to in- 
dulge it in our hearing. Wait a bit, till they were 
all back in the saloon, and then hear how wittily 
they would depict the manners of the steerage. We 
were in truth very innocently, cheerfully, and sen- 
sibly engaged, and there was no shadow of excuse 
for the swaying elegant superiority with which 
these damsels passed among us, or for the stiff 
and waggish glances of their squire. Not a word 
was said ; only when they were gone Mackay sullen- 
ly damned their impudence under his breath; but 
we were all conscious of an icy influence, and a 
dead break in the course of our enjoyment."

essays that at first blush appear out of place in this

Sir Samuel Ferguson, and William Thorn (the 
Weaver Poet) brings these three essays easily within 
the scope of the book : " The Land o' the Leal," 
"The Laird of Cockpen,"'and other songs of Lady

viduality of his genius. The essay on Sir Samuel 
Ferguson, by the way, suggests a previous work by 
Mr. Williams, "The Poets and Poetry of Ireland." 
Our author evinces a fine appreciation of folk-song, 
but he possesses the critical instinct rather than the 
critical faculty ; he knows songs, not texts. The 
volume before us gives vivid first-hand impressions, 
richly illustrated by full and free and admirable 
citation. The style of the writer is spirited and 
readable, but careless : there is no excuse for " a 
comic opera libretto writer," none for the telescop- 
ing of paragraphs at page 91, none for the hopeless 
confusion of nomen et omen at page 108, where the 
Laurence Oliphant of our own generation seems to 
be identified with the Laurence Oliphant of the 
Jacobite rising in 1745. In fine, the book is a wit- 
ness to the abiding interest of its new-old themes, 
though hardly a contribution to the fund of knowl- 
edge on the subject of folk-song. 

German studies The work which Miss Helen Zim - 
of Shakespeare's mern has translated from the Ger- 
man of Louis Lewes, and published 
with the title " Shakespeare's Women" (Putnam), 
has little to distinguish it from the hundreds of sim- 
ilar books of Shakespeare commentary. It begins, 
as such books usually do, with chapters on Shake- 
speare's times, Shakespeare's life, the English stage 
before Shakespeare, etc. The author claims some 
originality, however, in the fact that he presents 
studies of the whole line of Shakespeare's women, 
chonologically, in what he conceives to be the order 
of their creation ; beginning with Venus in " Venus 
and Adonis," and ending with Queen Catharine. 
His reason for this is that Shakespeare's own life 
and character being developed by a process of evo- 
lution, so these characters of his creation were of 
necessity subjected to the same psychological pro- 
cess. But this petitio principii has so little justifi- 
cation in any exact knowledge, and the learned 
author's style being moreover heavy and verbose, 
one fails perhaps of being sufficiently grateful for 
his endeavor, except as another illustration of the 
capacity of the German mind for exploring every 
nook and corner of a subject, and bringing to light 
with equal pains the infinitely little and the infi- 
nitely great.

Louis Philippe, and he served his country with dis- 
tinction in many parts of the world. In his open- 
ing chapters he draws a lively picture of his child- 
life and school-days, and then passes on to the story 
of his professional wanderings, which takes up the 
bulk of the volume. Born in 1818, Joinville en- 
tered the navy in 1831. He visited the United 
States for the first time in 1837, and in the follow- 
ing year was put in command of a ship and sent to

showed that, though a prince of the blood, he was 
no mere holiday captain and fair-weather sailor. 
He made a tour overland of this country in 1841, 
visiting the chief points of interest, playing (rather 
reluctantly) the social lion, and showing, like most 
of his countrymen, a kindly disposition to make the 
best of things and to shut his eyes to the seamy side 
of Brother Jonathan's coat. Returning to France 
in 1843, Joinville was appointed to the Admiralty 
Board, then engaged in paving the way for the re- 
modelling of the French navy ; and later on, after 
a season of active work on the Barbary Coast, he 
had the satisfaction of overseeing, with M. Dupuy 
de Lome, the construction of France's first ironclad 
ship. After the revolution of 1848, he went into 
exile in England destined, as he says, " not to see 
my country again for two -and -twenty years, and 
then in all the horror of invasion and dismember- 
ment and the terror of the Commune." A hearty, 
kindly sailor, standing as it were midway between 
the old school and the new, Joinville knew his call- 
ing thoroughly, from reefing a top-sail to manoeu- 
vring an iron-clad. Yet, good sailor as he was, one 
is tempted to say that he missed his calling by not 
turning author. The crisp, fluent style loses little 
in the hands of the excellent translator, Lady Mary 
Lloyd. 

Of the making of books about Lon- 
don there has been no end since the 
days of Stow, nor need there be an 
end, the metropolis (that " great wen," as virulent 
Cobbett called it), changing socially and archi- 
tecturally from decade to decade. That the Lon- 
don of to-day is not the London of Pierce Egan, 
or even of Thackeray and " Boz," no one who has 
travelled thither with anticipations founded on 
these authors needs be told. Much that they espe- 
cially delighted to honor has vanished. The taverns 
and cider-cellars, the cozy inns and "back- 
kitchens," where Costigan warbled and Mr. Guppy 
dined with the knowing Mr. Smallweed, exist 
only in print. They belong to ancient history, like 
sedan chairs and link-boys ; and their places are 
filled by great, flaring establishments, all plate 
glass and gas jets, show, swagger, and discomfort. 
Thirty-seven years ago Mr. George Augustus Sala 
published his "Twice Round the Clock; or, The 
Hours of the Day and the Night in London"; and 
he now supplements it with " London Up to Date" 
(Macmillan), a collection of descriptive papers on 
what is to be heard, seen, and commented on in the 
British metropolis of 1894. " They are," says the 
author, " so many detached essays describing scenes 
and characters which did not find a place in ' Twice 
Round the Clock.' " In Mr. Sala's new book there 
is little or nothing of what is called " low life " 
save, indeed, in a Police Court sketch that '' Boz " 
himself might have written. The author is no longer 
at an age when one cares to go, or can go, " slum- 
ming "; therefore it is mainly the sights and humors 
of the " West End " that he draws for us. Such

chapter-headings as "A First Night at the Lyceum," 
"A Ballot at a Pall Mall Club," "A Charity Ba- 
zaar," " A Picture Sale at Christy's," " A Culture 
Conversazione," " Travels in Regent Street," etc., 
convey a fair notion of the scope of the book. 

The many fragmentary accounts of 
JSSlEi the famous " Brook Farm " experi- 

ment are now supplemented, in a 
fairly authoritative way, by Dr. John Thomas Cod- 
man's ' Brook Farm Personal and Historic Me- 
moirs " (The Arena Co.). Dr. Codman is one of the 
few surviving members of the Community, and his 
work is therefore based upon intimate personal 
knowledge of the inner workings of the scheme and 
of the character and personalities of those inter- 
ested in it. He traces the history of the little pol- 
ity through its manifold phases, social and indus- 
trial, touching and humorous, from its germ in the 
Transcendental Club of 1836, down to its disrup- 
tion ten years later. The book is plentifully be- 
sprinkled with memories of the more notable Brook 
Farmers. Hawthorne spent some months at the 
Farm, thinking, it seems, " his manual labors might 
in a small way do a trifle towards aiding the ideal 
state." That the great romancer's "manual la- 
bors " (which must have been largely emblematical, 
like the Emperor of China's annual ploughing) 
would really have done much to lighten Mr. Rip- 
ley's subsequent load of debt, may be doubted ; and 
one may add here (on our author's authority) that 
Hawthorne himself was one of the creditors, and 
that he "growled," in a rather unidealistic way, 
over the amount due him. The volume provides 
data for a thorough understanding of the theoret- 
ical and fiscal basis of the Community ; and there 
is an appendix containing letters to and from Mr. 
Ripley, which throw much light upon the moral and 
intellectual temper of the times. Dr. Codman's 
book is not only extremely interesting as a narrative, 
but it furnishes an instructive economic study of the 
practical workings, under favorable conditions, of a 
socialistic phalanstery ; nor do we mean to imply 
here that the Fourierist needs read nothing but fail- 
ure in the lessons of " Brook Farm." 



Napoleon on the Mr - Montgomery B. Gibbs's "Mili- 
battie-fieid and tary Career of Napoleon the Great " 
by the camp-fire. (Chicago: The Werner Co.) is an 
effort to portray the Emperor as his marshals and 
soldiers knew him on the battlefield and beside the 
campfire. Mr. Gibbs has clearly given his subject 
much thought and study ; and as he is possessed of 
a notably lively and easy style his book should 
prove popular. Napoleon's battles are described in 
turn, from the pictorial and anecdotal rather than 
the technical standpoint, from Toulon to Waterloo ; 
and the graphic quality of the text is enforced by 
numerous full-page illustrations in half-tone, largely 
after well-known painters. The publishers issue the 
book in good shape, and it is altogether likely to 
hold its own against its numerous competitors. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

We note the completion, by publication of the second 
volume, of the fine edition of Malory's " Morte Dar- 
thur " (Macmillan) edited by Professor Rhys and illus- 
trated hy Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. The work of the 
artist is, after its peculiar manner, admirable; but ex- 
amination only confirms our first impression that of all 
manners that of Mr. Beardsley is least suitable to adorn 
the text of our great fifteenth century prose classic. 
But the volumes are in all other respects worthy of 
the noble piece of literature that they enshrine, and 
most book-lovers will be willing to put up with Mr. 
Beardsley's eccentricities for the sake of such beauty of 
print, generosity of margin, and chaste simplicity of 
coyer decoration. 

Three more parts XVII., XVIII., XIX. of The 
Book of the Fair " (The Bancroft Co., Chicago) con- 
firm the favorable opinion we have several times ex- 
pressed as to the merits of the work. The illustrations 
are profuse and attractive, and their subjects are chosen 
in a way to represent the varied aspects of the Exposi- 
tion ; while the accompanying text is fairly satisfactory. 
It becomes evident, as the work nears completion, that 
it will become the chief literary and artistic record of 
the world's great event of 1893. As the printing of this 
work must be regarded as the most notable achieve- 
ment of Chicago typography, it is fair to mention that 
it comes from the Blakely Printing Co. "The Book of 
the Fair " is sold only by subscription. 

Three recently-published chemical treatises are of 
much interest to the student. Mr. Douglas Carnegie's 
" Law and Theory in Chemistry " (Longmans) is a course 
of lectures given before a summer school of teachers at 
Colorado Springs. It runs all the way from the al- 
chemists to the latest theories of molecular architecture. 
" A Text-Book of Inorganic Chemistry " (Longmans), 
by Mr. G. S. Newth, is a compact systematic work based 
upon the periodic classification of the elements. The 
late Carl Schorlemmer's " Rise and Development of Or- 
ganic Chemistry " (Macmillan), in a new and revised 
edition, is third of our treatises. The work of revision 
has been done by Mr. Arthur Smithells. 

In our recent editorial on the subject of poetry as 
literary criticism, mention was made of two anthologies. 
One of these, edited by Mrs. Richard Strachey, is en- 
titled "Poets on Poets," and is imported by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. " English Poets on English 
Poets " would have been a more exact title, for the ed- 
itor does not go outside of our own literature either for 
subjects or extracts. She also excludes living writers, 
which keeps Mr. Swinburne from being represented 
at all. The selections are arranged chronologically by 
authors, while marginal notes indicate the subjects. 
There are many fragments as well as whole poems. 
The whole is ushered in with some pleasing and sensible 
prefatory remarks. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. have begun the publication 
of a series of selected English novels, which is designed to 
include many of the favorites of a past generation. The 
volumes will be illustrated, and each is to have an intro- 
duction. Maria Edgeworth's " Castle Rackrent " and 
" The Absentee " are grouped in the first volume of 
this series, and the introduction, which is of some 
length and extremely readable, is the work of Mrs. 
Anne Thackeray Ritchie. The volume is moderate in 
price and attractive in appearance.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, March 9, 1895. 

Mr. Stnalley's return to America and acceptance of 
the position of New York correspondent of the London 
" Times " is among the more interesting literary an- 
nouncements made this year. But the New York press 
has, so far as I have been able to observe, ignored it 
editorially, without exception ; the " Tribune " perhaps 
because that paper may be unwilling to admit the loss 
of one who has shed such lustre on its pages, the other 
daily papers for fear of seeming to proclaim the " Tri- 
bune's " excellence now or formerly. I refer to the an- 
nouncement of Mr. Smalley's intended return to Amer- 
ica as a " literary " announcement because much of his 
work as correspondent may be classed as literature. 
The general correspondent of a great newspaper holds 
a half-way position between the newspaper man and 
the creative writer, for it sometimes devolves upon him 
to write for all time as well as for the passing mo- 
ment. 

It is now thirty-three years since Mr. Smalley joined 
the editorial staff of the New York " Tribune," having 
proved his ability as an all-around newspaper man by 
brilliant reporting in the field during the first year of 
the Civil War. In 1866 he was sent to report the war 
between Prussia and Austria, and the following year 
he became London correspondent of his paper. It is 
believed by some people here that on Mr. Greeley's 
death, in 1872, the mantle of the great editor might 
naturally have fallen upon Mr. Smalley's shoulders; 
but circumstances brought about a different arrange- 
ment, and he was content to retain his London position. 
As to Mr. Smalley's ability to edit a great paper, I am 
free to say that I think there are but two other men in 
this country with equal qualifications and fate has 
decreed that one of these should be his bitterest enemy. 
The other, of course, is Mr. Dana. 

Mr. Smalley, then, has for twenty-eight years pre- 
sented to us varying pictures of London and Conti- 
nental social and political life. He has been a constant 
attendant at "functions" of every character; he has 
held high converse with leaders of every type, even 
with royalty itself; and he has at the same time kept a 
careful watch upon the manifestations of the arts and 
the sciences. In all this he has assumed the attitude of 
a candid friend of both the American continent and the 
British archipelago, and has never hesitated to express 
his views as to the past, present, or future conduct of 
any living person. One may then feel quite at liberty 
to speculate upon his probable career as New York 
correspondent of the London " Times." In a cabled ex- 
tract from an interview, he is represented as saying: 
" My experience in London has taught me how Ameri- 
can life ought to be represented in order to interest the 
British public, and to doing this I shall devote myself." 
On the face of it, this statement seems a little discour- 
aging, as if to imply that there were any need of inter- 
esting the British public in American life, and that the 
true perspective must be altered in order to do so. I 
am proud of Mr. Smalley, as a Yale man, and as an 
American; but I have sometimes felt that his attitude 
toward his fellow-countrymen was slightly deprecatory, 
as distinguished from the sturdy assumption of Mr. 
Lowell, for instance. This attitude has been shown in 
the recent controversy with Mr. Hutton over the Car- 
lyle memorial, in which the Curtis memorial has been 
brought up. The fact is that unless such a scheme as 



the Carlyle memorial appeals naturally to those to 
whom it is presented, it ought to be dropped; and the 
names of princes and potentates of church and state 
should not be dragged in to give it life. As for the 
Curtis memorial, all that our British friends have done 
about it is to inquire, " Who is Curtis, anyhow ? " 

An absence of thirty years from one's native land 
gives large opportunities for observation and compar- 
ison. Will Mr. Smalley be equal to these? I believe 
that he can be. He has lately been in this city, and he 
has written his impressions of his visit to the " Tri- 
bune." It is a trifle discouraging to find that they have 
most to do with the gilded interiors of fashionable New 
York houses of entertainment, and with those true ex- 
otics, often grafted upon sturdy native stock, the New 
York society girl and married belle. Does Mr. Smalley 
really consider these the choicest flowers of republican 
culture? We shall see ; and also we shall see whether 
he chooses to take his view of American life through 
the opalescent windows of our Fifth Avenue palaces. It 
is not necessary, far less than the other, that he should 
look through the dingy window-panes of what a pom- 
pous candidate for the laureateship has called our " new 
Grub street." Let Mr. Smalley keep clear of all en- 
tangling alliances, either with the residents of million- 
aires' row or with the literary shysters unfortunately 
so numerous in this city. 

Mr. Smalley, by his own statement, returns to Amer- 
ica a poor man. The chief reason for this, it may be 
supposed, is that he has been a sort of uncommissioned 
ambassador at the court of St. James, sometimes repre- 
senting his country more truly than the resident at the 
legation. He has spent his means freely, and he de- 
serves honor for his openhandedness. Of late, ill- 
health has also drawn upon his resources. As to his 
" London Letters and Some Others," published two or 
three years ago, the only fault I have to find with the 
work is that it is in two volumes instead of in ten. His 
letters are in every sense a history of Great Britain in 
our own times, and many of the author's best things 
are unduly abbreviated or not given at all. 

There have been several book-clubs in the United 
States whose chief object has been the publication of 
fine editions of original or selected books, but Mr. 
Thomas B. Mosher, of Portland, Me., is, I think, the 
pioneer publisher of editions de luxe exclusively, at 
moderate prices. His triumphs of daintiness and cheap- 
ness have been duly chronicled in this correspondence, 
and I am now glad to announce for immediate publica- 
tion his new edition of " A. E.'s " charming book of 
" Homeward Songs by the Way," so warmly praised 
last year by English reviewers both in and out of the 
" log-rolling " set. " A. E.," whose identity is not yet 
revealed, is a young Irishman, and the first edition of 
these poems was published in Dublin. Mr. Mosher's 
edition will consist of 925 copies, with fifty Japan vel- 
lum copies at a slightly higher price. Mr. Bruce Rogers, 
a young designer of promise in Indianapolis, will be re- 
sponsible for the cover design and title-page, as well as 
for some head-pieces and tail-pieces to the poems. " A. 
E." has contributed fifteen new poems to Mr. Mosher's 
edition. 

I must defer until another time mention of the pro- 
posed consolidation of our Astor and Lenox libraries 
with the Tilden fund into one vast Public Library of 
the city of New York, representing eight millions of 
property. It is less than a month since I wrote you that 
" New York has no public library." The plan awaits

approval by the trustees of the Astor library, and action 
by the New York legislature. 

" The Fine Arts Federation," composed of societies 
interested in the fine arts, now organizing, will no doubt 
assume national proportions. 

By offering new professorships of political economy, 
history, and mathematics, the friends of Barnard Col- 
lege have secured admission for their women students 
to the Columbia School of Political Science, in the face 
of a previous refusal. Professor John B. Clark, author 
of " The Science of Wealth," has accepted the political 
economy professorship. 

It may be fitting to mention a recent social event, in- 
volving a member of a noted literary family. Miss 
Francesca Monti Lunt, the daughter of George Lunt, 
the poet, and the niece of Dr. Thomas W. Parsons and 
of Luigi Monti, has just been married at old Trinity to 
an Italian nobleman. Mr. Monti, it may be remem- 
bered, is the " young Sicilian " mentioned in Longfel- 
low's " Tales of a Wayside Inn." He and the late 
Mr. Lunt married Dr. Parsons's sisters, I believe. Mr. 
Monti has given lectures in Italian literature here for 
many years. 

Mrs. Henrotin has made a decided impression here 
and elsewhere during her visit East as president of the 
General Federation of Women's Clubs. No less was 
to be expected of this brilliant woman.

LITERARY NOTES. 



A posthumous volume of poems by James Russell 
Lowell will soon be published. 

The Massachusetts Horticultural Society proposes to 
erect a monument to Francis Parkman, for many years 
its president. 

Mr. Korolenko, the Russian novelist, who visited 
America in 1893, is about to publish a volume of his 
impressions of travel. 

Edward Fitzgerald's letters to Fanny Kemble, now 
running in " Temple Bar," will be published in two vol- 
umes at the end of the year. 

The March " Magazine of Poetry " is devoted to " No- 
table Single Poems," by English authors, to the number 
of three or four score, mostly, if not all, now living. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis has gone to Honduras 
in search of literary material for the Harper periodi- 
cals. He will afterward go to Panama and Caracas. 

An American Committee on the Carlyle House Pur- 
chase Fund has been formed, with Bishop Potter as 
chairman. The English contributions to the fund now 
amount to 1300. 

There will be a classical conference at Ann Arbor, 
March 27 and 28, arranged by the Michigan School- 
masters' Club. An extremely attractive list of papers, 
reports, and lectures is offered. 

Cesare Cantu, born in 1807, died at Milan on the 
eleventh of this month. He is best known for his his- 
torical novel " Margherita Pasterla," his " Storia Uni- 
versale," and other historical books. 

Once more the press dispatches announce the death 
of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Misled by the pre- 
vious report of his demise, we published a brief obituary 
note June 1, 1894, to which the reader is now referred. 



A new batch of eight " Old South Leaflets " includes 
documents illustrative of New England history, by Brad- 
ford, Winthrop, Cotton, John Eliot, Roger Williams, 
and others. The series now numbers fifty-five, most of 
them being sold at five cents a copy. 

" Der Conjunktiv bei Hartmann von Aue," by Pro- 
fessor Starr Willard Cutting, has just been issued by 
the University of Chicago Press as the first of a series 
of " Germanic Studies." It is a pamphlet of fifty odd 
pages with a score of tables as an appendix. 

The latest of the educational history monographs 
issued from the Government Printing Office is a " History 
of Education in Maryland," by Dr. Bernard C. Steiner. 
Many of the chapters are contributed by special writers, 
that on the Johns Hopkins University, for example, by 
President Gilman. 

The monthly bulletins of the Providence Public Li- 
brary, compiled by Mr. W. E. Foster, are extremely 
valuable for their reference lists on subjects of timely 
interest. The numbers for the current year give us 
lists on Holmes, Korea, Buddhism, Stevenson, Munici- 
pal Government, German Literature, Wagner, and 
Trilby." 

Two games, in boxs, come from Mr. W. R. Jenkins, 
the publisher of modern language books. " Das Deut- 
sche Litteratur Spiel " is the familiar game of " Au- 
thors " in Teutonic guise. " The Table Game " is a sim- 
ilar device for pupils in French, and seeks to familiarize 
them with the names of things that appear on the din- 
ing-room table. 

On March 2, Professor John Stuart Blackie died in 
Edinburgh, at the age of eighty-five. He was one of 
the famous group of men born in 1809. For eleven 
years he occupied a chair in an Aberdeen college, and 
for thirty years thereafter taught Greek at the Univer- 
sity of Edinburgh. His publications were numerous, 
ranging from classical philology to philosophy, literary 
criticism, and poetical translations. Of recent years he 
has been noted among the champions of the modern 
Greek language as an introduction to the ancient. 

Sir Henry Rawlinson, news of whose death came on 
March 5, was born in 1810. He entered the Indian 
army, and served in Bombay and Persia for a number 
of years. His studies of Cuneiform began during these 
years, and his first decipherments were published in 
1838. In 1856 he retired from the Indian service, and 
returned to England to receive all sorts of honors from 
the scientific world. His subsequent life was that of a 
scholar, a statesman, and a diplomatist combined. His 
baronetcy dates from 1891. Of his many claims to re- 
membrance, his interpretation of Cuneiform is probably 
the greatest. 

No serious literary journal would waste its space upon 
the endless task of correcting the blunders made by 
newspapers, but occasionally there occurs one so con- 
spicuous as to be deserving of a moment's attention. 
The literary critic of a leading Chicago daily recently 
reviewed Ten Brink's lectures on Shakespeare, and 
wrote of the author as follows: " Professor Ten Brink's 
is a new name, but it will not long remain unfamiliar if 
he continues to write in this clear, sensible, forcible way. 
He is in touch with the best Shakespearian scholarship 
in Germany, England, and the United States." The 
words " the best Shakespearian scholarship in Germany " 
are particularly good. Poor Ten Brink ! If he could 
only have lived to read this flattering tribute to his 
worth !

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS. 

We present herewith our annual list of books an- 
nounced for Spring publication, classified as accurately 
as our information would allow, and with the books of 
each publisher arranged in a separate paragraph under 
the various departments. The list embodies informa- 
tion furnished us by thirty-four publishing houses ; the 
average of titles is about nine to each house, the list 
containing something over three hundred books as the 
prospective output of the Spring season. This list is 
somewhat larger than that of a year ago, which, as we 
then stated, was the largest Spring list yet published. 
Book-buyers and readers of all classes will find items 
of special significance to them in the various categories, 
while the list as a whole furnishes an interesting and 
an encouraging exhibit of our literary activities as ex- 
pressed in books. It should be noted that such Spring 
publications as have already reached us are not to be 
looked for here, these being given, instead, in the " List 
of New Books " in the present issue ; also, that forthcom- 
ing English works are not included, except in cases of 
re-publication or importation by American publishers.

DR. ROBINSON'S NEW BOOK ON SIMON PETER. 
SIMON PETER : His Later Life and Labors. By CHARLES S. 

ROBINSON, D.D. 12mo, cloth binding, fully Illustrated. $1.25. 

"Dr. Robinson has a remarkable aptitude in what we may call mod- 
ernizing historical themes, combining a vivid sense of what was with a 
similarly keen sense of what now is, so making the past minister in 
most natural ways to the wisdom for the present." The Advance. 

" Dr. Robinson is a master of Bible biography, and knows how to pre- 
sent the characters of the Book in such a way as to impress and mould 
the character of the reader. The later life of the Apostle is faithfully 
presented, with its failures and faith, with a strong leaning to the ap- 
plication of both to everyday life. It is a worthy successor to the for- 
mer volume, and the two together give an insight into the life of the 
most popular of the Apostles, at least to many men." The Christian 
Intelligencer.

" This volume, which is fully illustrated, will be cordially welcomed 
by every student of Scripture biography." New York Observer. 

"As a delineator of Scripture biography, strong and picturesque, 
thoroughly evangelical and scholarly, Dr. W. G. Blaikie has already 
been widely read on this side of the sea. This new volume will find, as 
it certainly deserves, a cordial welcome in every pastor's study. It 
ought to be placed in every church library. These books make excel- 
lent and helpful presents for superintendents and teachers during the 
holidays." Rev. Chas. S. Robinson, D.D. (Pastor of New York Pres- 
byterian Church). 

" Will find favor with scholars, while sufficiently popular in style to 
be enjoyed generally also." The Congregationalist. 

VOYAGES AND TRAVELS OF CAPT. BASIL HALL. With 

Illustrations. 8vo, cloth extra, $2.00. 

The writings of Captain Basil Hall have all the interest of a good sea 
story which is also a true story. Life on board a British man-of-war 
was a more stirring experience during the five and twenty years before 
Waterloo than it has ever been since, and the part of Captain Basil 
Hall's story reproduced in this volume covers ten years of that period 
of activity. The writer also gives interesting and lucid descriptions 
of the life of officers and midshipmen of the period. 

A biographical sketch of the author, who was a contemporary and 
friend of Sir Walter Scott, is prefixed to this volume.

1 ' TUCK-UP ' ' TALES. By AUNT DWEEDY. 18mo, cloth extra, 50 cts. 
These are simple sunny pictures for the little ones, where dolls and

When the time comes to "tuck-up " the tired little mites, who all de- 
clare they are "not a bit sleepy," one of these short stories should act

AS OTHERS SAW HIM. 

A Retrospect. A.D. 54. lOmo, $1.25. 
A book of remarkable interest, written to show how the 
Jews, of different classes, especially the ruling classes, were 
impressed by the words and works of Jesus. It purports to 
be written at Alexandria, about twenty-five years after the 
Crucifixion, by a Scribe who was in Jerusalem during the 
public life of Jesus, and was a member of the Council which 
delivered him to death. The unique interest of the subject, 
the perfectly reverent spirit of the writer, and the literary 
charm, lend to the book a profound interest.

qualities which most impress its readers are its ample and 
exact information and the wonderful charm of its style. These 
qualities characterize in equal degree this new book by Mr. 
Hearn.

SELECTED ESSAYS OF JAMES 
DARMESTETER. 

Translated from the French by HELEN JASTROW. Ed- 
ited, with an Introduction, by MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., 
Professor ia the University of Pennsylvania. 1 vol., 
12mo, $1.50. 

CONTENTS : The Religions of the Future ; The Prophets 
of Israel ; Afghan Life in Afghan Songs ; Race and Tradition ; 
Ernest Renan ; An Essay on the History of the Jews ; The 
Supreme God in the Indo-European Mythology. 

M. Darmesteter was one of the foremost scholars of the 
French Republic, especially in the domain of religion and 
Oriental research. To the thoroughness of the German scholar 
he added the precision and fineness of touch peculiar to the 
best type of French scholars. This volume contains the ripe 
fruit of his genius, and cannot fail to command the eager at- 
tention of thoughtful and cultivated readers. 

THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN THE 
MODERN ENGLISH POETS. 

By VIDA D. SCUDDER, Associate Professor of English 
Literature in Wellesley College. Crown 8vo, gilt 
top, $1.75. [April.] 

Miss Scudder has made a thoughtful, philosophical, and 
eloquent study of the characteristics of the poetry of the nine- 
teenth century to discover the development of thought on the 
highest themes. She analyzes keenly the poetry of Words- 
worth, Shelley, Tennyson, Arnold, Clough, and Browning, 
and aims to show the relation of the poetry of the century to 
democracy. The treatment is always suggestive and often 
brilliant. 



THE STORY OF CHRISTINE ROCHEFORT. 

By HELEN CHOATE PRINCE. IGmo, $1.25. 
This novel, by a granddaughter of Rufus Choate, is likely 
to attract much attention, both for the author's sake and the 
great interest of the subject. The story is French in scene 
and characters. Anarchism pleads its cause in some of the 
conversations, and shows its destructive spirit in the strike it 
incites ; love plays its part, but not with a French accent. It 
is an interesting story, and a good deal more ; and in view of 
the restlessness pervading the industrial world, it is a very 
timely story, which may be commended to a wide reading. 

THE DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION. 

By CHARLES CARLETON COFFIN, author of "The Boys 
of 70," "The Drum Beat of the Nation," etc. With 
many Illustrations. 1 vol., crown 8vo, $1.50. 
Under this attractive title, Mr. Coffin, to whom American 
readers are indebted for several very interesting volumes re- 
lating to both the early and the later history of their coun- 
try, has written a book that cannot fail to invite and reward 
a very wide reading. On a slight thread of romance he shows 
how much the women of the revolutionary period did to pro- 
mote the cause for which the men battled ; how strong, self- 
sacrificing, and patriotic they were ; and his book is a histor- 
ical romance in which the charm of the story is equaled by 
the variety, freshness, and validity of its historical informa- 
tion. 

A SATCHEL GUIDE

A SOULLESS SINGER. 

A Novel. By MARY CATHERINE LEE, author of " A 
Quaker Girl of Nantucket " and " In the Cheering-Up 
Business." 16mo, $1.25. [April.] 
A singer with a wonderful voice, but little feeling, has 
varied experiences, and in loving finds her soul. Like Mrs. 
Lee's previous stories, this is told in a bright, readable man- 
ner, and is likely to be one of the most popular of the season's 
novels. 

LETTERS OF CELIA THAXTER. 

Edited by Mrs. JAS. T. FIELDS. With Portraits. [April.] 
Mrs. Thaxter was so full of life, so deeply and sensitively 
responsive to all the sights and sounds and influences of na- 
ture, so sympathetic to her friends, and with so fine a literary 
touch, that her letters are of uncommon interest.

Translated from the German original of B. SCHULZE-SMIDT by NATHAN HASKELL DOLE. With photo- 
gravure frontispiece. 16mo, cloth extra, gilt top, $1.25. 

This brilliant novelette, which has just been rendered into English for the first time, although the work of a 
German writer, breathes the atmosphere of Italy and the very spirit of Italian life. Its principal characters are:: 
an Alpine guide, living on the shore of Lago di Garda; his wife, from whom he is estranged through a supposed 
crime; and a band of German artists. The beautiful scenery of Lake Garda and the Tyrolese Alps is charmingly 
described, and the dramatic qualities of the book are of exceptional strength.

Mr. Curtin needs no introduction to the lovers of Gaelic lore and legend. " He has approved himself," says 
Mr. Alfred Nutt, " the foremost collector of Irish oral literature, and has brought together an amount of material 
which, for intrinsic interest, holds its own by the side of Campbell of Islay's ' Popular Tales of the West Highlands.' ' *

instruction for cyclers in their first season on the wheel, and to promote a sport which the writer believes easily 
leads all others as a means of pleasure and health. It is intended for the use of amateur riders, or those who 
intend to become such, and does not treat of racing, or the training therefor.

SOCIAL EVOLUTION. r? m 

By BENJAMIN KIDD. Popular Edition, with the author's Latest Revisions and New Copyright Preface. 
Price, in paper, 25 cents; cloth edition, $1.50. 

"The volume . . . owes much of its success to its noble tone, its clear and delightful style, and to the very great pleasure the reader experi- 
ences as he is conducted through the strong, dignified, and courteous discussion. From a scientific point of view it is the most important contribu- 
tion recently made to biological sociology." Independent. 

" Competent judges will probably pronounce this to be one of the greatest books we have had since Darwin's ' Origin of Species. " It is indeed 
only an application of the laws of evolution there enounced ; but it is so wide in its survey, so penetrating in its insight, so sustained and masterly 
in its argument, and so surprising in its conclusions, that for intellectual ability it may be set on a level with any book of the century." Dr. Marcus

VOLUME IV. OF THE 

HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

By JOHN BACH McMASTEB. (To be completed in six vol- 
umes.) 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $2.50. 

The fourth volume opens with the repeal of the British Or- 
ders in Council and the close of the armistice concluded just 
before the surrender of Hull, and takes up the story of the sec- 
ond war for independence. The chapter called " The Return 
of Peace " ends the story of the war, and gives with great ful- 
ness an account of the treaty-making at Ghent. At this point 
a new era opens in our history. The war is over, the foreign 
complications whicli distracted the country since 1793 no long- 
er trouble it, and the people begin to turn their attention to 
domestic affairs. The remainder of the volume therefore 
treats of our economic history. " The Disorders of the Cur- 
rency " is a chapter in our annals which has never before been 
told. Chapters on political reforms, the Missouri Compro- 
mise, and the hard times of 1819 and 1820 complete the vol- 
ume, which is illustrated with many diagrams, and maps in 
outline and in color. 

DEGENERATION. 

By Prof. MAX NOBDAU. Translated from the second edition 

of the German work. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

This brilliant analysis of the literary, aesthetic, and social 
phases of the end of the century includes an examination of 
decadence in France, the work of Maeterlinck in Belgium, 
Wagnerisin in Germany, Ibsenism in the north, and other as- 
pects of contemporary sestheticism which are dissected with a 
thoroughness that renders the book a most remarkable con- 
tribution to social psychology. Prof. Nordau summarizes the 
mental unrest and thirst for novelty, which he finds as symp- 
toms of a phase of alienism due to two generations of over- 
stimulated nerves. His survey is modern to the last degree, 
and his conclusions are of intense interest. His fascinating 
and most suggestive book gives a picture of the aesthetic man- 
ifestation of the times, drawn with rare adroitness, vigor, and 
command of satire, and it will be found to hold a place which 
has not been occupied. 

THE STORY OF THE STARS, 

Simply Told for General Readers. By GEORGE F. CHAM- 
BERS, F.R. A.S., author of " A Handbook of Descriptive and 
Practical Astronomy," etc. 16mo, boards, illustrated, 30c. 
This is the first volume in a popular series entitled The 
Library of Useful Stories, written in clear, concise language 
by recognized authorities, and presenting the leading and 
latest facts of science, history, etc. The present volume fur- 
nishes an outline of the science of astronomy which will be 
found to be of great value by those who wish a general sur- 
vey of modern astronomy presented in a comparatively brief 
space. 

HANDBOOK OF BIRDS 

OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. With Keys to the Species ; 
Descriptions of their Plumages, Nests, etc.; their Distribu- 
tion and Migrations. By FRANK M. CHAPMAN, Assistant 
Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology, American Museum 
of Natural History. With over 200 Illustrations. 12mo, 
cloth. 

The author's position has not only given him exceptional 
opportunities for the preparation of a work which may be con- 
sidered as authoritative, but has brought him in direct con- 
tact with beginners in the study of birds whose wants he thus 
thoroughly understands. The technicalities so confusing to 
the amateur are avoided, and by the use of illustrations, con- 
cise descriptions, analytical keys, dates of migration, and re- 
marks on distribution, haunts, notes, and characteristic 
habits, the problem of identification, either in the field or 
study, is reduced to its simplest terms. 



MAJESTY. 

A Novel. By Louis COUPERUS. Translated by A. TEIXEIBA 
DE MATTOS and ERNEST DOWSON. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
" There have been many workers among novelists in the field of royal 
portraiture, but it may be safely stated that few of those who have 
essayed this dubious path have achieved more striking results than M. 
Couperus. ' Majesty ' is an extraordinarily vivid romance of autocratic 
imperialism, and the main aim of the book is so legitimate, and its treat- 
ment so sympathetic and artistic, that it is to be regretted that the au- 
thor should have adopted the portrait form at all. The striking but 
superficial resemblance between the leading characters of the story and 
those of more than one reigning imperial house will no doubt prove a 
bait to readers hungry for personalities; but the real merits of the 
book its dramatic intensity and powerful characterization are en- 
tirely independent of this factitious interest." London Academy. 

VERNON'S AUNT. 

By Mrs. EVEBARD COTES (Sara Jeannette Duncan), author 
of " A Social Departure," " An American Girl in London," 
" The Simple Adventures of a Memsahib," and " A Daugh- 
ter of To-day." Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
" The book is full of absurdities, and must be highly enjoyed by either 

Indian residents or people who have never visited that topsy-turvey 

land." Chicago Herald. 

"Amusing from beginning to end, and the experiences incident to 

the travelling of a maiden lady all alone in the Orient are cleverly and 

picturesquely told." St. Louis Republic. 

"The merriest bit of fiction that has appeared this many a day." 

Boston Saturday Evening Gazette. 

EVOLUTION AND EFFORT, 

AND THEIR RELATION TO RELIGION AND POLITICS. By ED- 
MOND KELLY, M.A., F.G.S. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
This book is an attempt to show that the Evolution of to- 
day is differentiated from the Evolution which preceded man 
by the factor of conscious effort ; that man, by virtue of his 
faculty of conscious effort, is no longer the product of Evolu- 
tion but the master of it ; that the chief ally of this faculty 
is religion, and its most fruitful though as yet neglected field 
is politics ; that an alliance between religion and politics is 
essential to progress in the struggle of humanity with evil 
and with pain ; and that this alliance must practice the gospel 
of effort and not that of laissez faire. 

FAMILIAR FLOWERS OF FIELD 
AND GARDEN. 

By F. SCHUYLEB MA THEWS. Illustrated with Two Hundred 

Drawings by the Author. 12mo, cloth. 

In this convenient and useful volume the flowers which one 
finds in the fields are identified, illustrated, and described in 
familiar language. Their connection with garden flowers is 
made clear. Particular attention is drawn to the beautiful 
ones which have come under cultivation, and, as the title in- 
dicates, the book furnishes a ready guide to a knowledge of 
wild and cultivated flowers alike.

THE NEGLECTED ART OF 
TRANSLATION. 



These closing years of the nineteenth cen- 
tury have made us more cosmopolitan, in many 
respects, than we ever were before. The 
world has shrunk for us in several ways ; as 
a mere matter of geography, the greater part 
of it is within easy reach ; politically and soci- 
ally, the sense of human solidarity is growing 
all the time ; and in intellectual affairs it is 
safe to say that no voice having a real message 
to deliver is likely to wait long for apprecia- 
tive listeners. Neglected genius seems to have 
become a thing of the past, and we now suffer 
instead from a tendency to exalt with undue pre- 
cipitancy to the ranks of genius every ques- 
tionable and imperfectly-realized talent that 
appears upon the intellectual horizon. In liter- 
ature, particularly, we are alert as never before 
to catch the new note, to seize upon and ex- 
ploit the new thing. Let a poet, or novelist, 
or essayist but raise his head in any corner of 
civilization, and, if his message be not purely 
provincial in its application, he will soon find 
himself translated into the tongues of the aliens, 
and his thoughts will find lodgment upon their 
lips. Nay, if the message be but a provincial 
one after all, it is not unlikely to incur the 
same fate, such has become our curiosity con- 
cerning all our fellowmen, such our insatiable 
demand for the new type and the local coloring. 

This linking together of the literatures by 
translation is particularly noticeable among the 
peoples using the German, English, and French 
languages, and, as an intellectual tendency, 
has followed the order just named. Germany 
was the leader in the movement, and through- 
out most of the century, has been seizing with 
omnivorous appetite upon whatever was most 
notable in the literary product of other coun- 
tries. Not only has she assimilated the pro- 
ductions of such peoples as the Hungarians, 
the Scandinavians, and the Slavs peoples 
closely associated with her either politically or 
ethnically but also those of the English and 
French, the Italian and Spanish. The works 
of Jokai, CEhlenschlager, and Pushkin first 
found a large foreign audience among the 
Teutons ; Dante, Calderon, and Voltaire early

became theirs by right of conquest, and the 
Shakespearian permeation of German litera- 
ture is so familiar a fact as hardly to need 
mention. The English people, on either side 
of the Atlantic, have followed the Germans, 
although at a distance, in thus welcoming the 
foreigner to their hearth, and we all know the 
good work of Carlyle and Coleridge, in the 
English case, and of the Concord group of 
plain livers and high thinkers, in our own. 
France, maintaining longer than Germany or 
England her self-sufficient attitude, has more 
recently fallen into line, and the most desperate 
efforts of chauvinism have failed to protect her 
frontiers from the invasion of the alien writer. 
Indeed, the proposition that new converts are 
the most zealous of. all, is well illustrated by 
the eager enthusiasm with which the French- 
man is nowadays taking up the foreigner and 
his works. The distinction is very marked for 
example, between the polite curiosity with 
which Ampere explored Scandinavian litera- 
ture for the information of Frenchmen half a 
century ago, and the genuine interest which is 
taken by Frenchmen of to-day in the works of 
the great Norwegians. 

In our own country, while cordial recogni- 
tion of the established names of foreign liter- 
ature has not been lacking since mid-century, 
we have, until very recently, been slow to seize 
upon the work of new writers. Tourguenieff, 
for example, had long been naturalized in 
France and Germany before he was discovered 
by America. Dr. Ibsen had done the greatest 
and most enduring part of his work twenty 
years ago, but the voice of the student here and 
there among us who had discovered him was 
that of one crying in the wilderness. A few 
contemporary Germans and Frenchmen, some- 
what capriciously selected, were known to our 
readers ; others, equally important, were not 
known at all. As for the contemporary Italian, 
or Spaniard, or Pole, or Russian, his name 
was, with hardly an exception, meaningless to 
us. Most of us who studied the history of 
foreign literatures were content to stop with 
the dawn of the century ; of active modern 
tendencies in the world of foreign letters we 
had not the least notion. 

The rapidity with which, of late, nous avons 
change tout cela, is a little surprising. The 
past few years have brought before our eyes, 
in bewildering succession, an array of contem- 
porary writers from all parts of the civilized 
world. Novelists and dramatists, essayists and 
poets, of the most diverse nationalities and 



ideals, compete for our attention. Not only 
do the new works of the older literatures crowd 
upon us, but the new literatures of Canada, 
Australia, Greece, Portugal, and Spanish 
America as well. Now most of these new 
claimants for attention require conversion into 
our vernacular before we may become ac- 
quainted with them. And this fact leads us 
to the real consideration of the present article, 
which is, briefly, that the art of translation, so 
far from keeping pace with its practice, lags 
painfully behind. The more translations we 
get, the worse they seem to be. Time was when 
a translation was at least apt to be a labor of 
love, conscientiously and sympathetically per- 
formed. At present, it seems a sort of scram- 
ble to be first in the field. A novel by a pop- 
ular foreign author is almost sure to get before 
our public in a translation so wooden, so un- 
idiomatic, so essentially ignorant, as to be a 
mere travesty of the original. One who has 
occasion to examine many of these productions 
is only too often reminded of the sort of trans- 
lation that was suffered by Bottom, and is sur- 
prised beyond measure when he comes upon a 
version which is not an utter perversion. We do 
not here speak of the ethical question, so often 
ignored by those who deliberately alter or cur- 
tail the text of their originals, but merely of the 
lack of intelligence and capacity nearly always 
displayed by translators of contemporary liter- 
ature. 

The simple fact is that the qualifications of 
a translator are. set far too low, both by his em- 
ployer and the public. The long-suffering 
public, of course, has to take what it can get, 
is too apathetic to demand better workmanship, 
and easily grows accustomed to the hack-work 
that dulls the taste and deadens the literary 
sensibility. As for the employer, the publisher, 
he finds a ready sale for the cheap product, 
and hence does not offer the compensation that 
good work ought to bring. Of course he has 
a moral responsibility in the matter, but he is 
not likely to care for that when his pocket is 
concerned. Any young person with a smat- 
tering of French or German and a dictionary 
to help him out, feels competent to become a 
translator, it never occurring to him that the 
cultivation of an English style is the first 
requisite of all ; while the average publisher 
shows that he accepts this view by refusing to 
pay for translations any sum that a competent 
workman, the real master of two languages, 
can possibly accept. Of course, honorable ex- 
ceptions to this rule may be found here and

there, and equally of course good translations 
will now and then come from persons actuated, 
not by self-interest, but by a delight in good 
workmanship for its own sake. But the con- 
ditions that fix the existing standard of trans- 
lation are still mainly of the hard commercial 
kind, and, until they are in some way modified, 
the standard will remain low. 

It is possible that the art of translation may 
rise from its present disrepute, but the process 
will be slow. Cause for hopefulness may be 
found in two facts. The first of these facts is 
that the Copyright Act of 1891 for the first 
time gave the foreign writer some measure of 
control over the American publication of trans- 
lations of his work. He has it in his power to 
secure an adequate translation, and to preempt 
the market for it. Unfortunately, he does not 
always know a good translation from a bad 
one, and even if he does, may find it difficult 
to arrange for what he wants. Possibly he may 
come to learn by experience how immeasurably 
his reputation suffers from blundering transla- 
tions, and take measures to secure himself 
against them. The other cause for hopeful- 
ness is in the fact that an immense expansion 
has taken place of late years in the modern 
language departments of our educational insti- 
tutions. The languages of Europe are pur- 
sued in the scientific and literary spirit by an 
increasing number of students every year. 
These students will make most of the transla- 
tions that will be read by the coming decades. 
It is not too much to believe that their better 
methods and fuller knowledge will make itself 
felt more and more as the years pass, and that 
their efforts may cause a marked elevation in 
the current standard of literary translation. 



FROM SOPHOCLES TO IBSEN. 

The theatre-going portion of the Chicago public 
has recently been given an opportunity to compare 
two types of dramatic art widely separated in point 
of time. Within the past month, two plays by Dr. 
Ibsen have been seen upon the boards, while the 
" CEdipus Tyrannus " of Sophocles, given by the stu- 
dents of Beloit College, was repeated at Chicago a 
few days ago. Of the Greek play, it may be said 
that a distinct success was scored, mainly attributa- 
ble to the remarkable histrionic talent displayed by 
Mr. C. W. Wood, who took the part of the King. 
There was hardly a trace of amateurishness in 
his work, and his delivery of the more fateful pas- 
sages in the tragedy elicited an applause that was 
richly deserved. The only thing about the " CEdipus " 
performance which seems to us to have been ill ad- 



vised was the use of a home-made translation, which 
did not commend itself by any markedly poetical 
quality, in place of some standard English version. 

The two Ibsen plays referred to were " An En- 
emy of the People" and "Master Builder Solness." 
The former was given by Mr. Beerbohm Tree, and 
the latter by the students and instructors of the 
Chicago Conservatory of Dramatic Art. Mr. Tree's 
performance, which was introduced, evidently as a 
sort of experiment, near the close of his two weeks' 
engagement in Chicago, was both an artistic and a 
popular success. Its popular success was in fact as- 
tonishing, for scene after scene was wildly ap- 
plauded, and at the close Mr. Tree, who had taken 
the character of Stockman, was forced to make a 
few remarks to the audience. He acquitted himself 
gracefully of the task, thanking his appreciative 
auditors in the name of the author of the play. 
The most surprising thing about the reception which 
thus astonished both the actor and the few Ibsenites 
scattered through the audience was the fact that the 
greatest applause was called out by the passages in 
which the author's assertion of individualism is the 
most vigorous, and his denunciation of the rabble 
and the "compact majority" is the most uncom- 
promising. "The majority is always wrong," de- 
claimed Dr. Stockman ; and the house, even the gal- 
leries, cheered the sentiment to the echo. The scene 
was, on the whole, very disturbing to one's precon- 
ceived notions of what the dear public likes and de- 
mands in matters theatrical. 

The " Solness " performance, which was given to 
a large matinee audience, showed painstaking study 
on the part of the performers, and seemed to hold 
the listeners more closely than most plays succeed 
in doing. The marchenhaft character of the drama 
is quite as evident in the witnessing as in the read- 
ing, and the veiled symbolism in which the author 
delights puzzled those of the audience to whom it 
was all a new thing, and who tried to account to 
themselves for events as they happened. The story 
of Aline's lost dolls, as was to be expected, resulted 
in hilarity pure and simple. But the attention with 
which the work was followed could not fail to be 
noticed by those who, familiar with the play, found 
their chief interest in noting its effect upon the aud- 
ience. Although the hearers were not a little per- 
turbed in spirit by the strange series of episodes 
unfolded before them, it was clear that the sugges- 
tiveness of the play was not lost upon many of them. 
And the wisest of critics may hardly blame them 
for not being quite sure of what the play meant. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"THE AIMS OF LITERARY STUDY." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

At a recent meeting of a Chicago literary club, the 
volume of Professor Corson on " The Aims of Literary 
Study," and the comment upon the same by Professor 
Edward E. Hale in THE DIAL of February 16, were 



204 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



passed in review. Having been appointed spokesman 
of the club, and adding a little indignation of my own, 
I beg leave to discuss in your columns Mr. Hale's theory 
of " university discipline," and to suggest a different 
reading of the facts of education, so far as these per- 
tain to the study of literature. 

In one thing we are in complete accord : namely, that 
literature does not lend itself readily to purely intellec- 
tual discipline. When literature is so employed, not 
only is offence done to the literature itself, but also to 
the student whose time is surely misspent in reading 
with the intellect the masterpieces of literature to be 
called life presently, when things get their true names. 
The published studies of literature, which reveal the 
working upon literary material of the intellectual alone, 
are among the saddest chapters of educational history 
sad because the materials are put to a use alien to 
their purpose, and saddest because the mind which has 
been applied so diligently has really missed its intellect- 
ual discipline. So the matter stands at present, that 
if the concern of the university is with intellectual train- 
ing alone, literature is most certainly out of place in the 
university. 

But can it be that the American university limits 
itself to this single discipline ? We have always sup- 
posed that the purpose of educational institutions, in 
this country at least, was to educate. While perhaps 
the primary function of the university is to know, yet 
other educational forces surround this, which are not " in- 
cidental," or " left to care for themselves," but are fun- 
damental likewise. By its department of Physical Cul- 
ture, for instance, the university recognizes its function 
to educate the body, not primarily for the sake of the 
sound mind, but for the sound body. The recent ac- 
tion of the Harvard Faculty, in voting to abolish inter- 
collegiate foot-ball, was prompted by the wish to pro- 
tect the players' life and limbs, and not to maintain the 
" university discipline." Departments of Art, Elocu- 
tion, and Oratory, the various professional and techni- 
cal training schools, testify to the interest of the uni- 
versity in some things besides this one discipline. But 
the point I wish here to make is that the study of liter- 
ature itself, as conducted to-day in our leading univer- 
sities, is the best witness to our universal interest in 
education. While Mr. Hale is affirming that literature 
is out of place in the university, it is in fact very much 
in place. We suspect that Professor Lowell, long ago 
at Harvard, taught literature in its absolute character, 
and found it not so very difficult, or incompatible with 
the university ideal. But we know, from the letters on 
the teaching of English which so lately graced the col- 
umns of THE DIAL, that to-day the subject is being 
taught quite generally in its vital meaning and content, 
even as Professor Corson would direct. It was stated 
definitely enough by Professor Cook of Yale from 
whom, as a skilful philologist, we might have expected 
the narrow definition of university discipline that the 
object which he proposed to himself as a teacher of lit- 
erature was the development in the student, whether 
graduate or undergraduate, of insight and power terms 
which include the emotional, the aesthetical, and the 
moral, as well as the intellectual (THE DIAL, Feb. 1, 
'94, p. 71). The editorial in the June number of THE 
DIAL, in summary of the reports on teaching English, 
rightly affirms that this high aim is general. Professor 
Corson's book really records the experiences of many. 

To indicate more definitely the present scope and 
tendency of literary study, and thereby the relation 



which Professor Corson's book has to present university 
teaching, I may report some facts which have just been 
gathered by the English Department of the University 
of Chicago, pertaining to the teaching of literature in 
various institutions during the current year. The work 
of thirty-four of the leading American colleges and uni- 
versities was examined with reference to the courses 
offered in English literature. The total number of 
courses reviewed was 378. Fifty-seven of these are 
primarily for graduates, with as many more immedi- 
ately serviceable to them. There are thirty-nine gen- 
eral courses set down for undergraduates, these consti- 
tuting the required work, and being divided about 
equally between a general historical course and the 
study of masterpieces. Twenty-eight courses deal with 
Old and Middle English literature, with Chaucer as the 
favorite author. Sixty-one courses are devoted to six- 
teenth century literature, thirty-five of which deal with 
Shakespeare alone. There are seventeen courses in 
seventeenth century literature, twelve of these being 
given to Milton alone. To the Classical period, twenty 
courses are given, thirteen of them relating to the his- 
torical evolution of literature. Twenty courses consider 
the Romantic period, including eleven devoted to the 
great authors Coleridge and Wordsworth being the 
favored ones, the latter having four courses devoted to 
him alone. The nineteenth century has seventy-nine 
courses to its service, eight of these being general sur- 
veys, eleven given to American authors, about thirty to 
different representative authors or groups of writers, five 
to Browning alone, five to Tennyson alone, and six to 
modern fiction, with George Eliot as leader. In forty- 
nine courses the different kinds or species of literature 
are considered, as the epic, the lyric, and the drama; 
seven of these review the history of English fiction. 
Prose claims sixteen courses. Miscellaneous courses 
number about twenty, which indicate some personal pre- 
ference of the instructor or some experiment in teach- 
ing. Twenty-nine other courses, for the most part new 
ones, constitute what is practically a new department of 
literature as distinguished from English literature; of 
these, sixteen are given to the history of criticism, five 
are devoted to comparative literature, and six relate to 
the theory or aesthetics of literature. 

I make bold to say, then, that the case stands thus, 
that nothing which concerns literature is out of place in 
the universities. And I cannot leave the subject with- 
out exclaiming how well that this is so. Science itself 
requires the cooperation of the literary, the intuitive, 
the imaginative, the emotional, and the moral. In the 
statutes which established the chair of poetry at Oxford, 
it was declared that the study of poetry would be of 
value in the university, as tending to the improvement 
of the sciences, secular and sacred; recognizing thus that 
poetry, as a high and holy art, is a motive power among 
men. Not less of literature, but more, is the promise 
of the future. Then it may be that the most pitiable 
of all sights will vanish from the earth the spectacle 
of a man who is able to render but a single intellectual 
response to the universal appeal, the wonder and the 
glory, of the world. Then some other than academical 
attainments will qualify the doctor of philosophy, even 
some insight and power. But why not recognize at 
once, with Professor Corson, that in literature " Being 
is teaching," and that in the " university discipline " 
being as well as knowing has a place ?

A PSYCHOLOGICAL, AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 

In composing, or rather in compiling, his 
life of John Addington Symonds, Mr. Horatio 
F. Brown has confined himself mainly to the 
task of giving logical and convenient form to 
the material at his disposal, which has fortu- 
nately been unusually abundant. " I imagine," 
he says, "that few men of letters have left be- 
hind them, in addition to some thirty published 
volumes, such a mass of letters, diaries, and 
memoranda as that which has passed through 
my hands." The bulk of this material, con- 
sisting of journals, note-books, an autobiog- 
raphy, jottings of foreign life and travel, etc., 
came directly into the author's possession under 
Mr. Symonds's will ; and this portion has since 
been liberally supplemented by letters in the 
hands of relatives and friends, and by a touch- 
ing account, written by Miss Margaret Sy- 
monds, of her father's last journey and death. 
Mr. Brown's task has, therefore, been mainly 
editorial ; and the work before us is virtually 
an autobiography more specifically, a psy- 
chological autobiography. As such, it is likely 
to prove a surprise to all but the writer's 
closer friends. Few who knew Mr. Symonds 
personally (as we gather from Mr. Brown's 
engaging sketch of him) could have surmised 
that the " brilliant, audacious exterior " hid a 
central core of spiritual pain ; that the genial, 
cheery conversation, implying at every turn the 
open sense and the warm artistic temperament, 
veiled at times a spiritual drama as intense as 
that which filled the soul of Bunyan. To those 
who identify religion with fixity and fervor of 
faith, it may sound paradoxical to say that Mr. 
Symonds was both profoundly religious and 
profoundly skeptical ; yet such was the fact, 
and the fundamental fact, of his nature. To an 
intellect keenly analytical and impatient of au- 
thority, a passion for the absolute, and a dis- 
like of compromise, he joined a temperament 
essentially religious and perilously emotional. 
" The central, the architectonic, quality of his 
nature," says one who knew him well, " was re- 
ligious. ... If the honest, courageous recog- 
nition of the Self confronted with God, the soul 
with the universe, the struggle to comprehend 
and be comprehended, is religious, then Sy-

monds was preeminently a religious man." 
Thus antithetically constituted, with a genius, 
as it were, for faith, and a passion for demon- 
stration, his dominating pursuit and life-long 
occupation was the search for a creed that 
should satisfy at once his emotional longings 
and his intellectual scruples. This conflict be- 
tween the desire for the warmth and solace of 
a personal God, and the rational objections to 
a God conceived under human attributes; the 
clinging to the old, and the vague uneasy sense 
of the dawning of the new, mark, perhaps, a 
temperament characteristic of our transitional 
age, critical and scientific, an age in which, 
as Mr. Symonds himself says, " it is almost 
the greatest faith to have no faith, for the old 
faiths are passing away and the new one has 
not come, and the men of this generation are 
like travellers before daybreak, the majority 
asleep, the few awake and watching anxiously 
for the dawn." 

Down to his twenty-ninth year, to what he 
always termed " the crisis at Cannes," Mr. 
Symonds seems to have confined his specula- 
tive quest of a self-forged creed to the region 
of the abstract, where he fought over again, to 
his infinite spiritual weariness and discomfiture, 
the old dialectic battles, with the old result, or 
rather lack of result. That he had read Kant 
previously to this flight into the inane, seems 
improbable, though we find one reference to the 
Konigsberg philosopher. After Cannes, and 
down to the end of his life, the inquiry was 
gradually transferred from the field of the ab- 
stract to the more congenial, and to his artistic 
sense more inspiring, field of the concrete ; but 
the problem and the organic impulse to grap- 
ple with it remained the same. " I do not 
think," says Mr. Brown, " that Symonds ever 
expected the problem to be solved, the struggle 
to be abandoned." 

" The renunciation of the quest would have seemed 
to him spiritual death the solution of the riddle, also, 
most likely, death. In December, 1889, he wrote: 
' When will the soul be at ease ? If it has t6 live for- 
ever, I believe mine will never be at ease.' Did he want 
it to be ? I think so, but upon terms which we sup- 
pose to be precluded by the limitations of human nature, 
by the loss of its individual self-consciousness, by ab- 
sorption into the Universal consciousness. ' E naufragar 
m' d dolce in questo mare.' " 

The successive steps in Mr. Symonds's Pyr- 
rhonic descensus, leading into the (to him) 
fatal abyss of disbelief in a paternal, provi- 
dential, and humanly lovable God, are clearly 
traceable in the more introspective journals and 
letters. The process began early. A skeptic

in his teens, he denied at school the dogmas of 
original sin and eternal damnation. This early 
lapse could hardly have in itself brought him 
much spiritual discomfort ; but the habit of 
doubting, of exacting of each article of faith a 
precise account of its origin and credentials, 
once set up, grew apace. The result, for a 
skeptical and severely logical mind, was fore- 
gone. He tells us : 

" One after another fell the constituent beliefs of 
Christianity, and at last, when I considered the history 
of all religions, and applied the canons of cold analysis 
to the central creed of all, I was forced to acknowledge 
that the personal Deity might, after all, be nothing but 
a mirage a magnificent image of humanity or, as I 
expressed it, a Brocken spectre, projected by the human 
consciousness upon the mists of the unknown." 

In short, does not man, to reverse the terms of 
the Mosaic statement, create God in his own 
image, the concept broadening and refining in 
proportion to his own advancing growth and 
refinement? a fact still covered by the meta- 
phor of the Brocken spectre, since a giant causes 
a more splendid phantom than a dwarf. In 
every humanly possible idea of God is present 
and paramount the element of anthropomorph- 
ism, so fatal from a rational, yet so precious 
and salutary from an emotional, standpoint, 
for is not, after all, a creed which lacks this 
central and vital concept of a personal and 
therefore an anthropomorphic God the coldest 
and most cheerless of empty formulas, a repel- 
lant Frankenstein-fabric, lacking, as it were, a 
soul? The overthrow of the hypothesis of a 
personal God marked the turning-point in Mr. 
Symonds's speculations. He had reached this 
nadir of the destructive process " hastily, ea- 
gerly, and full of zeal," and found himself, at 
the supreme moment of iconoclastic conquest, 
face to face with weakness and death. Thence- 
forth, then, the problem of problems must be 
to build if possible, even to re-build, to re- 
place with loving care stone by stone the frag- 
ments of the temple he had thrown down. " I 
had," he says, " to seek some formula which 
should satisfy me about myself, the universe, 
the future. How have these things come about ? 
what do they mean ? " 

Turning for light here to science, one finds its 
quasi - explanations confessedly null touching 
these ultimate questions. Science knits the web 
of the larger experience, formulates the cosmic 
process, subsumes the particular under the gen- 
eral and the general under the more general 
a process obviously limited and blocked at pre- 
cisely the point where the metaphysical inquiry 
begins ; but so far from explaining, in any re- 



ligious or transcendent (extra -experiential) 
sense, science tends to breed the conviction that 
such explanation is impossible. Science only 
intensifies the final mystery and whets the crav- 
ing for a solution, by telling, in terms unreal- 
izable and grandiose, of " innumerable myriads 
of years," of a stretch of time compared with 
which the duration of the human race is but 
" a scape in oblivion," of an infinitude of 
globes and constellations infinitely beyond those 
to which (if there be a perceiving eye there) 
the light of our sun penetrates vaguely as a 
mere glow-worm spark or twinkling taper. Sci- 
ence, indeed, everywhere finds law ; but, dis- 
cerning no Lawgiver, inclines to think the crav- 
ing for one is but a human and perhaps a 
transient weakness, an " idol of the tribe." 
The object of its own faith it finds in an eter- 
nal order, bringing forth ceaseless change, 
through endless time, in endless space : a con- 
clusion intellectually imposing, but, to the de- 
votional temper, lame and impotent enough. 

On comparing the ascertained facts of sci- 
ence with the Ptolemaic and even ruder concep- 
tions underlying the general scheme of Chris- 
tianity, with its primitive spatial and temporal 
postulates, Mr. Symonds seems to have found 
his crucial difficulty in the doctrine of the As- 
cension : 

" When I carried that dogma of the Ascension, on 
which the peculiarly Christian idea of a corporeal im- 
mortality rests, to science, science derided it. < For,' 
she aptly said, ' in infinite space there is no height nor 
depth; a body carried upwards through the clouds be- 
yond the force of gravitation, if that were possible, is 
simply lost, Do you not perceiye that the Ascension 
was a beautiful myth, adapted to the simple conception 
of the universe as it existed in those unscientific days, 
the whole value of which is now historical, and which 
must be placed with the other instructive and exquisite 
religions of the world ? ' This reasoning I could not 
answer; in fact, it seems to me unanswerable. And 
with the Ascension, which is the master-miracle of Chris- 
tianity, the minor miracles had to give way. Christian- 
ity took its place among the religions of the world, and 
told me far more about the human than the divine na- 
ture." 

For a man of Mr. Symonds's temper there was 
clearly no middle course here, no a pen pres, 
no convenient half-way station between denial 
and acceptance. Having rejected Christianity 
in part, he rejected it in all. Some will say 
that, finding the husk of no value, he threw 
away the kernel not always the highest proof 
of wisdom. The qualified adherence to Chris- 
tianity of men like his Oxford mentors, the 
Master of Balliol and Professor Conington, was 
impossible for him ; it had, he said character- 
istically, " something illogical in it." Reject-

ing Christianity, he tried in turn, and " some- 
what contemptuously " threw aside, the current 
spiritual nostrums, more or less idly ingenious 
attempts at mediation between the outworn old 
and the conjectural new; he felt that he " should 
not be saved by any of these palliatives." To 
one goaded on as he was to suicide itself as a 
means of discovering the truth, patient agnos- 
ticism was impossible. Even Spinozism, which 
must have powerfully attracted his intellectual 
nature, would not do for him. " I would 
sooner," he exclaims, " have Comte than the 
worshippers of Ens ! " 

We have spoken of " the crisis at Cannes " 
as the turning-point in Mr. Syrnonds's spiritual 
fortunes. Extracts from his papers at that pe- 
riod will serve to show what a struggle it cost 
him to abandon his old creed. They will show 
also, what most readers will conjecture at the 
start, that his spiritual torments, the paroxysms 
of mental agony which racked him at intervals 
through life and brought him to the brink of 
madness and suicide, had their pathological 
side. There was more point than solace in 
the remark he quotes of a common-sense, well- 
digesting friend (who probably regarded the 
possession of " nerves " as a reprehensible weak- 
ness) that " when people talk of hell they often 
mean a state of their nerves." Touching the 
Cannes crisis, Mr. Symonds says : 

" All the evil humors which were fermenting in my 
petty state of man poignant and depressing memories 
of past troubles, physical maladies of nerve-substance 
and of lung-tissue, decompositions of habitual creeds, 
sentimental vapors, doubts about the moral basis to hu- 
man life, thwarted intellectual activity, ambitions rudely 
checked by impotence, all these miserable factors of a 
wretched inner life boiled up in a kind of devil's caldron 
during those last weeks at Cannes, and made existence 
hell. The crisis I passed through then was decisive for 
my future career. ... I contemplated suicide. But 
death is not acceptable it offers no solution. I loathe 
myself, and turn in every direction to find strength. What 
I want is life; the source of life fails me. ... In my 
present state of entire negation I cannot get the faith 
without the strength, or the strength without the faith. 
Both remain outside my reach. . . . The last night I 
spent in Cannes was the worst of my whole life. I lay 
awake motionless, my soul stagnant, feeling what is 
meant by spiritual blackness and darkness. If it should 
last forever ? As I lay, a tightening approached my 
heart. It came nearer, the grasp grew firmer, I was 
cold and lifeless in the clutch of a great agony. If this 
were death ? Catherine, who kept hold of me, seemed 
far away. I was alone, so utterly desolate that I drank 
the very cup of the terror of the grave. The Valley 
of the Shadow was opened, and the shadow still lies 
upon my soul. ... In another nature, acting under 
other circumstances, the phenomenon of what is called 
' conversion ' might have been exhibited. With me it 
was different. I emerged at last into stoical acceptance 



of my place in the world, combined with epicurean in- 
dulgence. Together, these two motives restored me to 
comparative health, gave me religion, and enabled me, 
in spite of broken nerves and diseased lungs, to do what 
I have done in literature." 

The " religion " which was the outcome of 
the Cannes crisis was remote enough from what 
men commonly understand by that now omin- 
ously elastic term. It was, rather, a substitute 
for religion ; a last resort ; a drifting spar clung 
to by one who had long battled with the waves 
of doubt and darkness, and despaired of the 
haven. It was an abandonment of the old prob- 
lems, seen at last to be insoluble ; a shifting of 
the inquiry from the abstract to the pheno- 
menal, as to the only field where knowledge is 
possible. Doubtless there remained a glim- 
mering hope, a hoping against hope, that even 
in the field of sense patient interrogation might 
yield some faint intimation of the mystery " be- 
hind the veil." Turning to Mr. Symonds's 
own confessedly cloudy statement of his self- 
forged religion, it appears as a nebulous com- 
pound of pantheism, poetry, stoico-epicurean 
morality, and generalized science of the Spen- 
cerian type. As it is labelled the " Religion 
of the Cosmic Enthusiasm," one may pardon- 
ably infer, as a further element, a tincture of 
what the Germans call Schw'drmer&L This sys- 
tem Mr. Symonds thought " the only creed 
compatible with agnosticism forced upon a can- 
did mind." 

" Nothing but the bare thought of a God-penetrated 
universe, and of myself as an essential part of it, to- 
gether with all things that appear in their succession 
ether and inorganic matter passing into plants, and 
creatures of the sea and beasts rising to men and women 
like myself, and onward from us progressing to the 
stage of life unrealised by human reason nothing but 
the naked yet inebriating vision of such a cosmos satis- 
fied me as a possible object of worship. When this 
thought flooded me, and filled the inmost fibres of my 
sentient being, I discovered that I was almost at rest 
about birth and death, and moral duties, and the prob- 
lem of immortality. Having lost the consolations of 
faith in redemption through Christ, and all that per- 
tains thereto, I had gained in exchange this, that I 

could 

lay myself upon the knees 

Of Doom, and take mine everlasting 1 ease.' " 

We have dwelt perhaps too exclusively upon 
the religious phase of Mr. Symouds's life-story 
though this is clearly its dominant element, 
and the one by virtue of which, to our think- 
ing, it outweighs intrinsically and will outlive 
(as a vivid and eloquent record of our age of 
spiritual unrest and change) all else that its 
writer has given us. There is much, of course, 
in Mr. Symonds's life that we have not touched 
upon here : the charming story (as good as

LAFAYETTE IN THE AMERICAN 
REVOLUTION.* 



Mr. Charlemagne Tower, Jr., has given us, 
in two interesting volumes, the best statement 
that has hitherto been published relating to 
Lafayette in the American Revolution, and, 
within the limits imposed upon himself, has also 
given a satisfactory account of the attitude and 
policy of France in our War of Independence. 
If Mr. Tower had added a chapter illustrating 
the diplomacy of France, under the malign in- 
fluence of Spain, relating to the peace negotia- 
tions of 1782 '83, in which it was proposed 
to leave the United States a weak nation within 
the limits of the Alleghany mountains and the 
Atlantic and the Eastern States, without an 
acre of ground in the great valley that in a 
few years was to become the centre of national 
power, readers of his work would better un- 
derstand the policy of France in the American 
Revolution. 

In the summer and fall of 1776, Lafayette 
completed his arrangements to give himself to 
the American cause. It was the darkest period 
of the War. New York was held by the British 
fleet and army. The disastrous battle of Long 
Island had been fought on the 27th of August. 
The British cabinet industriously sent over Eu- 
rope reports that the colonial armies were van- 
quished. Vergennes was compelled to suspend 
his nearly-completed negotiations with Spain 
for an alliance with France in aid of the United 
States ; and the alliance was never consummated. 
Silas Dean, American agent at Paris, was dis- 
couraged ; and he notified Lafayette that, under 
the circumstances, it would be better to sus- 
pend his undertaking. The answer of Lafay- 
ette was characteristic of his inflexible will and 
purpose. In his memoirs he says : 

* THE MARQUIS DB LA FAYBTTE IN THE AMERICAN REVO- 
LUTION. With some account of the attitude of France toward 
the War of Independence. By Charlemagne Tower, Jr. In 
two volumes, illustrated. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



" I went to Mr. Dean and thanked him for his frank- 
ness. ' Up to this moment, sir,' I added, ' you have 
seen only my zeal; it is going, perhaps, to become iise- 
f ul ; I am buying a ship which will carry over your offi- 
cers; it is necessary to show some confidence, and it is 
in danger that I like to share your fortunes.' " 

Lafayette was not quite twenty years old, 
when (July 27, 1777) he presented to Congress 
the agreement of Dean, approved by Franklin, 
appointing him a major general in the armies 
of the United States. Congress hesitated to 
ratify the appointment. Washington had been 
much perplexed by the applications of French 
officers for commissions in the service. Lafay- 
ette, writing to Congress, said : " After the sac- 
rifices I have made, I have the right to ask two 
favors at your hands : the one is to serve with- 
out pay, at my own expense ; and the other, that 
I be allowed to serve, at first, as a volunteer." 
Thereupon (July 31, 1777) Congress declared : 

" Whereas, the Marquis de Lafayette, out of his great 
zeal to the cause of liberty, in which the United States 
are engaged, has left his family and connections, and, 
at his own expense, come over to offer his services to the 
United States, without pension or particular allowance, 
and is anxious to risque his life in our cause Resolved, 
that his services be accepted, and that, in consideration 
of his zeal, illustrious family, and connections, he have 
rank and commission of Major General in the Army of 
the United States." 

A few days later Lafayette was presented to 
Washington at a dinner in Philadelphia. As 
the party was about breaking up, Washington 
took Lafayette aside, complimented him upon 
his zeal and sacrifices, and invited him to make 
the military quarters of the Commander-in- 
Chief his home. That was the beginning of 
an historic friendship. 

Lafayette performed his first military serv- 
ice under Washington, as a volunteer, at Bran- 
dywine, about six weeks after he received his 
commission. Of this event Mr. Tower says : 

" His conduct during that day had been viewed with 
the greatest favor by those who shared its incidents 
with him. He had shown himself a man of courage 
and a soldier; and although he had been, but a few 
hours before, but a foreigner, a stranger who had come 
into the continental army, he was welcomed, that night, 
in the American camps, as a tried friend and a comrade." 

A wound received at Brandywine put Lafay- 
ette under the surgeon's care for about six 
weeks. Before his wound was healed, he was 
again in the saddle ; and he received a favor- 
able notice from General Green for his part in 
the small action near Gloucester. Lafayette 
had now won his spurs ; and Congress, upon 
the recommendation of Washington, authorized 
giving to Lafayette a separate command. With 
some enthusiasm, Mr. Tower says :

" That which gave Lafayette the affection of General 
Washington, which won his way to the hearts of the 
American people, and made him one of the leaders in 
the War of Independence, was neither the nobleman nor 
the representative; it was the man Lafayette himself." 

The American army lay at Valley Forge in the 
memorable winter of 1777-8. The British 
army occupied Philadelphia. On the 6th of 
February, 1778, treaties of commerce and alli- 
ance were entered into with France. It was 
understood that in consequence of those treaties 
a French fleet equal to the British fleet would 
soon appear in the American waters. In that 
case, Clinton would no longer be safe in Phila- 
delphia. Washington, desiring accurate inform- 
ation in relation to the movements of Clinton, 
sent Lafayette, with twenty-two hundred picked 
troops, to Barren Hill, about eleven miles from 
the city, to watch the movements of Clinton, 
who in turn led out his whole army, more than 
four times larger than the American force, in 
the confident expectation of capturing Lafay- 
ette. But Lafayette, by good strategy, foiled 
the combinations of Clinton, and drew off his 
forces without the loss of a man. Clinton then 
evacuated Philadelphia, marching across New 
Jersey to New York, pursued by the American 
army, which, on the 28th of June, fought the 
drawn battle of Monmouth, that might have 
been a defeat but for the genius of Washing- 
ton, or a victory but for the treachery of Lee. 
On that day the conduct of Lafayette gained 
for him new laurels. Clinton did not retire too 
soon. But for untoward delays, the French 
fleet, in connection with the land forces would 
(to use an expression of General Grant) have 
" bottled up " the British army on the Dela- 
ware, as it was afterward " bottled up " on the 
Chesapeake. 

On the 21st of October, 1778, Congress gave 
Lafayette leave to go to France, " and to re- 
turn at such time as shall be most convenient 
to him." He had come to the United States 
with the promise of a youth of wealth, noble 
birth, liberal education, and an unfaltering de- 
votion to the cause of American liberty ; he 
returned, a man tested by important military 
service, with the love of the people, the respect 
of Congress, and the approval of Washington, 
then coming to his recognized position among 
the great men of the world. Lafayette was 
first of all a Frenchman. But, consulted by 
the king, the ministers, and other eminent men 
in France, in matters relating to the war, he 
rendered, in his absence from the United States, 
inestimable service to the American cause. 



He arrived at Boston, on his return to the 
United States, April 28, 1780. 

I pass over many interesting events in which 
Lafayette had an influential part, the opera- 
tions in Rhode Island, the operations of the 
French fleet under Estaing, the usefulness of 
Lafayette in soothing the jealousies of French 
officers, and his influence over Congress and in 
the States. Mr. Tower appropriately gives a 
large space to an account of the aid given by 
France in response to urgent appeals from the 
United States. In the first years the aid was 
given secretly, in order to keep up an appear- 
ance of neutrality with England. At the time 
of Washington's disastrous defeat on Long 
Island, while Vergennes was giving, and meant 
to continue secretly giving, all the aid in his 
power to the United States, he wrote to the 
British minister that he was deeply touched by 
the attention which permitted him to share the 
joy he felt at the happy news of the success of 
the British arms. At that very moment Ver- 
gennes was anxiously waiting for the time when 
he might throw off all disguise, and give openly 
and on a large scale all the help the Americans 
required to win their cause. The surrender of 
Burgoyne's entire army (October 17, 1777), 
gave Vergennes his opportunity. " Aut nunc, 
aut nun quam" he said. The treaty of Feb- 
ruary 5, 1778, led to the final victory which 
ended the war October 19, 1781 ; for it is prob- 
able, if not certain, that without French credit, 
money, fleets, and soldiers, the American ar- 
mies, would have been destroyed. It does not 
follow, however, that the spirit of American 
independence, which took root from 1630, 
would have been extirpated by the entire de- 
struction of the American armies at that time. 
Burke, in his speech on " Conciliation with 
America " (March 22, 1775), and Turgot, in 
his celebrated memoir to the king (April 7, 
1776), declared that upon the destruction of 
the American armies the contest would be 
transferred to the Mississippi Valley, where 
British fleets could not penetrate and where 
British armies would not succeed. It is due, 
however, to French aid, that our cause tri- 
umphed in the seaboard states where the war 
began. Nor, as Mr. Tower says, is our debt 
of gratitude at all cancelled by the considera- 
tion that France acted wholly from interested 
motives. And it is evident enough that, with 
notable exceptions as in the case of Lafayette, 
Frenchmen generally did not love the Amer- 
ican cause nor the American people. Ver- 
gennes was frank enough to make no such pre-

tence. The American colonists had fought 
under British banners in the war of 1756. In 
addition to immense contributions of money, 
they raised twenty-eight thousand provincial 
troops, Massachusetts alone raising seven thou- 
sand men. In that war Washington won his 
first military distinction. The humiliating 
treaty of 1763, by which France was forced to 
part with all her American possessions on the 
main land, had left among the French people 
an inextinguishable hatred of England, such as 
is now felt in France against Germany for the 
loss of Alsace and Lorraine. The American 
war, then, was for most Frenchmen an occa- 
sion for revenge or a possible opportunity to 
recover the territory lost under the treaty of 
1763. 

It was the policy of the British Cabinet, in 
the first three or four years of the Revolution- 
ary war, to hold possession of the great cities, 
as Boston, Philadelphia, New York. After 
years of fighting it was discovered that on that 
policy the country could not be conquered. It 
was then decided to send armies sufficient to 
subdue and hold the Southern States, leaving 
the North to be dealt with afterward. Charles- 
ton was reduced. Lord Cornwallis, left in com- 
mand of the south, on the 25th of April, 1781, 
transferred his army to Virginia. To meet the 
changed conditions, Washington assigned to 
Lafayette a separate command in Virginia, 
where he began active operations on the 10th 
of April. This was the last and most import- 
ant military service of Lafayette in the United 
States. I shall not attempt to follow Lafay- 
ette in the marches and counter-marches of this 
campaign, covering eleven hundred miles, and 
over historic ground now especially familiar to 
readers of the Virginia campaigns in our late 
Rebellion. Mr. Tower's excellent maps enable 
the reader to follow the entire campaign intelli- 
gently. His force was not sufficient, however, to 
justify him in bringing on or accepting a gen- 
eral engagement with Cornwallis ; but he kept 
the latter constantly occupied, under the instruc- 
tions of Washington, until the Compte de 
Grasse, with a fleet and an army, arrived in 
Chesapeake Bay on the 30th of August, when 
the British army was completely invested within 
its fortifications at Yorktown. The French of- 
ficers desired to make the assault at once, and 
win for themselves the glory of overthrowing 
Cornwallis ; but Lafayette, as commander-in- 
chief, wisely determined to wait until Wash- 
ington, transferring his army from the Hudson, 
should reach the field, take command of the 



allied armies, and make victory sure in the final 
battle of the Revolution. 

Lafayette's military service in the American 
Revolution ended with the surrender of Corn- 
wallis. He sailed from Boston on the 27th of 
December in the " Alliance," placed at his dis- 
posal by Congress. Just before he sailed, 
Washington, writing to him, said : 

" I owe it to your friendship and to my affectionate 
regard for you, my dear Marquis, not to let you leave 
this country without carrying with you fresh marks of 
my attachment to you, and new expressions of the high 
sense I entertain of your military conduct and other im- 
portant services in the last campaign, although the latter 
are too well known to need the testimony of my appro- 
bation, and the former I persuade myself you believe is 
too well riveted to undergo diminution or change." 

These were not idle words of compliment. 
They were the expression of the habitual feel- 
ing of Washington in relation to Lafayette, 
who was the only foreigner in our armies who 
had his unqualified confidence and friendship. 
It was a great distinction, and one entirely de- 
served. Lafayette, says Henry Martin, never 
changed. " What, above all, distinguishes 
Lafayette," says le Comte de Segur, " is an 
unchangeable constancy of character, which 
tends without deviation always to the same end. 
To work ceaselessly to establish, extend, and 
consolidate liberty is the dominant idea which 
for more than fifty years has directed his 
conduct, animated his soul, and inspired his 
words." Lovers of liberty, on two continents, 
cherish his name, on which no clouds rest ex- 
cept those arising from calumnies engendered 
in a later strife, some of which, like the vil- 
lainous charge relating to his conduct on the 
5th and 6th of October, 1789, were invented 
on the return of the Bourbons to France in 1814.

tion of essays on Chinese life entitled " A Cor- 
ner of Cathay." The book is a shining ex- 
ample of intelligent observation and equally 
judicious selection. It seems to entirely fill 
Bovee's two requisites of a book : it is " luminous 
and not voluminous." The titles of the chap- 
ters show the attractive and varied nature of 
the subjects treated : " Farm Life in China," 
" Economy, Household and Personal," "Mar- 
riage Laws and Usages," "Mortuary Cus- 
toms," " Babies and their Grandmothers," 
"Children's Games," "Schools and Schooling," 
" Measures of Time," " Suits in Law," " Fab- 
ulous People and Animals," " Sundry Super- 
stitions," " A Queer Autumn Entertainment." 
"The Chinese Theory of Evolution," " Confu- 
cius and his Teaching," " The Tauists and their 
Magic Arts," " Chinese Piety, Filial, Fraternal, 
and Friendly." It seems impossible to quote, 
when each page vies with its neighbor in in- 
terest. In the last chapter a touching passage 
occurs in the story of the bad wife, who de- 
sired her husband to kill his feeble and depend- 
ent old mother. He consented, and took his 
old parent away on his back, pretending that 
he was carrying her out to take the country 
air. On the way, the old woman told her son 
he had gladdened her heart ten times. 

" The first was when he was born, when after much 
sorrow she knew she had a living boy; the second was 
when she first saw him smile, and knew that he was 
comfortable in her arms; the third was when he first 
held a thing in his hand, and she knew by his grasp 
upon it that he was strong; the fourth was when he be- 
gan to walk, and she knew that he would learn to take 
care of himself and to help her; the fifth was when he 
first went off to gather fuel, and she thought that hav- 
ing him she could keep the house and make a home; 
the sixth was when she first gave him some money and 
he started off without her to buy their food in the mar- 
ket; the seventh was when she could afford to let him 
go to school, and he came back at nightfall and told her 
what the teacher had taught him ; the eighth was when 
he put on the garb of an adult, and she knew she had a 
man to depend on at last; the ninth was when she got 
a wife for him, had paid all the wedding expenses, and 
made him able to establish a household of his own; the 
tenth was when he just now took her on his back, to 
carry her out to get sight of the sky and fields, that 
she might be refreshed and live the longer. As she 
talked thus, her son's heart was softened, and he could 
not cast away the mother who had loved him so well." 

The chapters on farm-life and economy teem 
with new, surprising, and important informa- 
tion ; the ones on schools and children's games 
are particularly pleasing. Miss Fielde is fitted, 
through her fifteen years' residence in China, 
her perfect knowledge of the language, as shown 
in her marvellous "Swatow Dictionary," and 
her intelligent discernment, to be an authority 



upon the subject on which she has written ; and 
we must have confidence in her judgment when 
she says of the Chinese : 

" That they are people of the highest capabilities is 
well known to the writer through her personal acquaint- 
ance with isolated instances of unselfish tenderness, of 
lofty self-respect, of true spiritual aspiration, and of 
wide philanthropy, and through her constant observa- 
tion among them of heroic endurance, of marvellous 
patience, and of sublime earnestness." 

The volume "Across Asia on a Bicycle " is 
made up of a series of sketches describing part 
of a bicycle journey round the world, by two 
young Americans immediately after their grad- 
uation from Washington University, St. Louis. 
They were three years on the journey, and 
covered over fifteen thousand miles ; they took 
over two thousand photographs, selections from 
which are reproduced in the illustrations of the 
volume. The services of guides and interpre- 
ters were never employed on the trip ; and, 
without doubt, the hardships of travel were 
thus much increased. But a closer acquaint- 
ance with strange people was also gained. The 
most interesting chapter in the book is, in view 
of the present state of affairs, an account of an 
interview with Li Hung Chang, the Prime 
Minister of China. The description of his 
person runs thus : 

" His face was distinctly oval, tapering from a very 
broad to a sharp pointed chin, half obscured by his thin 
gray goatee. The crown of his head was shaven in the 
usual Tseng fashion, leaving a tuft of hair for a queue, 
which, in the viceroy's case, was short and very thin. 
His dry, sallow skin showed signs of wrinkling; a thick 
fold lay under each eye and at each end of his upper 
lip. There were no prominent cheekbones, nor almond- 
shaped eyes, which are so distinctively seen in most of 
the Mongolian race. Under the scraggy mustache we 
could distinguish a rather benevolent though determined 
mouth; while his small keen eyes, which were rather 
sunken, gave forth a flash which was perhaps but a 
flickering ember of the fire they once contained. The 
left eye, which was partly closed by a paralytic stroke 
several years ago, gave him a rather artful, waggish 
appearance. The whole physiognomy was that of a man 
of strong intention, with the ability to force his point 
when necessary, and the shrewd common sense to yield 
when desiring to be politic." 

The interview impresses us with the Prime Min- 
ister's great shrewdness and inquisitiveness. 

" A merry heart goes all the day, 
Your sad tires in a mile-a," 

might well be the motto of the joyous book 
given to us under the happy title " When We 
Were Strolling Players in the East." Radiant 
good spirits, good health, good courage, and a

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



Mrs. Miln and her husband did not stroll 
through Oriental lands unimpeded and unham- 
pered. Young children, and maids and valets, 
and a company of actors, seemed, however, to 
her but the natural accompaniments to Eastern 
travel. Doubtless in the book on Japan by 
another woman traveller, Mrs. Isabella Bird 
Bishop, more real information of the country 
can be obtained ; but this actress, born in 
America in the South, bred in California in 
the West, educated at Vassar in the East, and 
married to an English actor, has such a cheer- 
ful, interesting way of giving her information, 
that we love to read it. Perhaps the most in- 
teresting chapters are on four women that Mrs. 
Miln knew in Tokio. Three were Japanese, 
one was the Anglo-Saxon wife of a Japanese 
gentleman. Two she met for the first time ; 
two she had known at Vassar College. One 
of the latter was Stamatz Yamakawa, wife of 
Japan's War Minister, Oyama. She had lived 
ten years in America, part of the time in the 
home of Dr. Abbott. She was eleven years 
old when she came here. A brilliant scholar, 
she took high honors, wrote charming essays, 
was president of her class, eager to acquire 
all occidentalisms of thought and dress. On 
her return, she married her elderly husband, 
to whom she never spoke till after the mar- 
riage ; and Mrs. Miln found the girl who had 
been so anxious to maintain for Japan a high 
intellectual standard, relapsed into a perfect 
Oriental, drowsy, gentle, a stickler for eti- 
quette, never reading a word of English or 
French, caring nothing for news of her college 
mates, faded in her beauty. The other Japan- 
ese Vassar student, of lower birth, is now a 
teacher of music in the Empress' College. 
Madame Sannoniya stands alone the one Eu- 
ropean woman of high character, high intellect, 
and charming personality, who has become a 
naturalized and potential individual at an East- 
ern court. She is the respected wife of an em- 
inent man, who is said to be the handsomest 
man in Japan, and the intimate friend of the 
Empress. 

The title given by Sir Edwin Arnold him- 
self to the papers in his " Wandering Words " 
" sketchy recollections " is thoroughly ap- 
propriate. The sketch entitled " Tent Life " 
is scarcely more than an outline, and a rather 
commonplace outline at that. The papers on 
Japan, entitled " Love and Marriage in Ja- 
pan," " Japanese Wrestlers," " Some Japanese 
Pictures," "Oriental Story-Tellers, " are the 



most interesting in the book ; and the descrip- 
tions of life in that land, so beloved of the au- 
thor, flow with the sugary, sensuous sweetness 
which he always pours forth at the thought of 
that earthly Paradise. He repeats and empha- 
sizes his assertion that the Japanese women 
are semi-angelic, the most pleasing of their sex, 
and of the purest and most refined on earth. 
That they are tranquil, gentle, and delicate, all 
who have ever had the pleasure of Japanese 
women-friends can corroboratively testify. We 
are certainly given plenty of variety in this 
book. We skip from Honolulu to peer through 
the Lick Telescope ; then we are upset in a 
dahdbeah on the Nile, but are rescued, and 
travel through the Holy Land to India, thence 
to Japan, back to India, and again to Japan. 
We are then suddenly startled by a purely En- 
glish tale of the rescue of a nude bather by his 
sweetheart, which seems but a chilly relation, 
through its neighborhood to the glowing chap- 
ters, " The Tiger's Village and Wild Boars." 
Then we have a realistic study of an English 
character worthy of Hardy's pages, " a tar- 
man "; then two very nice English stories ; then, 
through " Days at Sea," to the Orient again, 
and again to the Sandwich Islands, and thence 
home to England ; a slipshod, inartistic ar- 
rangement, by which both Oriental and Occi- 
dental tales suffer. The book is handsomely 
printed and illustrated.

HISTORY AND RELIGION.* 



Two allied truths are becoming daily more evi- 
dent : that history is the true test of religion, and 
that religion is a primary force in history. Some 
would accept the second assertion, while still de-

marring to the first assertion. Yet they are involved 
in each other. If religion stands for a potent, ever- 
present combination of causes at work among those 
forces which collectively make up history, then his- 
tory, in its unfolding, in its revelation of truth by 
results in action, must be the only sufficient and ade- 
quate disclosure of the real nature of any form of 
faith. We must know exactly how that faith pushed 
its way in the world of realities ; how far events, 
social and spiritual, accepted it as congenital with 
themselves ; how far they rejected it as alien to their 
ultimate success in a Kingdom of Heaven. 

These two assertions proceed on the notion that 
religion, as one whole, stands for natural forces, not 
supernatural forces, as we ordinarily use the words. 
Religion as strictly supernatural could not find its 
way into history. Like foreign material in a living 
organism, it would be constantly cast out. But if 
religion is congenital with the human mind, then it 
follows that history, growth, is the discriminating 
process by which its just and unjust, less just and 
more just, forces are discriminated from each other, 
and at length pronounced on in their ministrations 
to life. The supernatural is in men's minds only 
the shadows of those things, not the very things 
themselves, which work salvation. 

It is very interesting, therefore, to find, as in the 
works now before us, that history is constantly gain- 
ing a firmer hold on religion, and that none, even 
the most obstinate adherents to dogma, wholly over- 
look it. The higher criticism is only an effort to 
render faithfully historic forces, and the very mo- 
ment history enters it pushes to this logical result. 
The natural suffers no gaps; it takes religion to its 
very soul, and what it cannot so appropriate, it 
leaves behind as error. 

The first of these books, " The Permanent Value 
of the Book of Genesis," presents an example, which 
is now becoming strange, of the utter subordination 
of history to dogma. It would matter but little 
what the facts were, after they had been steamed 
and twisted in the heat of such a faith as is here 
presented, they would begin to take the form re- 
quired of them. The book is greatly deficient in his- 
toric sense and lucidity of thought. Perhaps these 
few sentences may let the reader into its temper. 

" The Deluge, with its clear piercing note of Judg- 
ment upon sin, guards through all the ages the true sig- 
nificance of the Passion of the Christ. For it compels 
men to trace in the Cross the eternal revelation of the 
wrath of God against moral evil, the fullest manifesta- 
tion of God's absolute righteousness, as well as the su- 
preme appeal of His love. Thus the character of God 
is vindicated from all appearance of indifference to sin. 
The way is prepared for the Revelation of Himself in 
our suffering flesh as men are thus taught to look on 
from that supreme manifestation of love to the great 
Judgment, to the disclosures of God's final and absolute 
verdict upon human action, when the true measure of 
each shall be fully shown, as it has all the time been 
clear and open in the sight of God" (page 164). 

If the deluge had so much work on hand, no wonder 
that it happened. 



" The Religion of Moses " is a small volume, con- 
cisely and clearly written, with great positiveness 
of thought. It aims, as against modern criticism, 
to rehabilitate, and more than rehabilitate, Moses as 
the great prophet and law-giver of his people. The 
author regards him as the Founder of the Theistic 
faith of Israel. As the book, however, opens no 
new lines of criticism, and confines itself chiefly to 
a re-rendering of the facts as it conceives them, it 
does not much alter the question at issue. 

" The Messiah of the Gospels " is a sequel to 
" Messianic Prophecy," and it itself opens the way 
for a third volume yet to appear on the Messiah of 
the Epistles and Apocalypse. The present volume 
discusses the Messianic ideas which immediately 
preceded the Gospels, and the Messiah as presented 
by each Evangelist. It also considers the apocalypse 
of Jesus as. given in the synoptic Gospels. The 
work is a laborious and scholarly one, but is severely 
trammelled by the conception that these various 
forms of anticipation have a definite prophetic hold 
on history. Every form of faith, springing from a 
spiritual interpretation of events, must give rise to 
a forecast of coming events. This forecast con- 
stitutes its apocalyptic temper, and is a matter of 
interest as a disclosure of its own character. When, 
however, these conceptions lose their living specu- 
lative force, and are transformed into a vision of 
coming events, they become perplexing, and, in a 
large measure, profitless riddles. How much acu- 
men has been wasted on Revelation ! There cannot 
well be a more marked inversion of ideas than to 
suppose that the anticipations of history control his- 
tory itself, are inseparably associated with it. The 
Professor is compelled, by the want of conformity 
of events with the shadows of them in men's minds, 
to defer the fulfilment of these prophetic ideas. 

" We have gone rapidly over the eleven Messianic 
ideals of the Old Testament, and have found only a 
single one of them, the suffering prophet, was entirely 
fulfilled by the earthly life of Jesus. ... It is clear, 
therefore, that the vast majority of the predictions of 
the Old Testament prophets and the great mass of their 
ideals were taken up by Jesus into his predictive proph- 
ecy and projected into the future " (page 336). 
It remains to be seen whether the final volume will 
still leave these Messianic ideas in the air. 

The title " Simon Peter, His Later Life and La- 
bors," is somewhat misleading. The book seems 
to be made up of brief evening lectures, whose unity 
is chiefly found in the fact that the passage of Scrip- 
ture selected has usually some connection with Peter. 
The apostle and his experiences are viewed as a 
text rather than as a study. As lectures, the sev- 
eral chapters are popular and effective rather than 
critical and instructive. The volume contains some 
fine pictorial illustrations. 

" Saint Paul and His Missions " is a book which 
aims to give a vivid historical foreground to the 
missionary life of St. Paul. It is a book of an ex- 
cellent kind, and admirable of its kind. A distinct 
and realistic character in the circumstances and

events which surrounded the apostle makes that 
great figure in human history more familiar and 
impressive to us, and tends ultimately to a more 
just estimate of his works on a basis of facts. His- 
tory and geography contribute freely to the purpose 
of the writer, and his book is both agreeable and 
instructive. 

" St. Paul's Conception of Christianity " offers a 
very full, discriminating, and candid discussion of 
the doctrinal beliefs of St. Paul, the constructive 
outline of his religious theory. The author recog- 
nizes the fact that the conception of salvation, as 
entertained by St. Paul, is diverse from that in- 
volved in the words of Christ, though he softens the 
difference between them. Our Lord makes spiritual 
development a perfectly open and normal move- 
ment in human life. The disciple is as a child with 
God. Nothing intervenes to disturb them. All 
progress is growth an enlarged interplay of vital 
impulses between them. St. Paul, on the other hand, 
profoundly influenced by his own misleading ex- 
periences and futile efforts, believes that legal bar- 
riers lie athwart the upward way, and are to be re- 
moved as a condition of salvation. Thus the death 
of Christ is not merely an appeal to the heart of 
man, but makes new relations with God possible to 
him. 

Much of the confusion and controversy in the- 
ology have arisen from an effort to reconcile and 
make identical the perfectly free naturalistic con- 
ception of Christ with the artificial and arbitrary 
one of St. Paul. The moment we are content to 
accept a radical diversity in these two outlooks on 
the spiritual world, the binding power of dogma 
gives way, and the spiritual world becomes to us a 
new creation. In this particular the free recog- 
nition of the diversities of belief involved in the 
New Testament " The Gospel and its Earliest In- 
terpretations," by Rev. Orello Cone, D.D., recently 
noticed by us (THE DIAL, Sept. 16, 1893), is a 
most penetrative and able volume. 

"The Old Church in the New Land" is made up 
of pleasant and instructive lectures on the church 
history of England, given by a rector to his people. 
They naturally show the lively interest of the 
speaker and audience in the subject, and are some- 
what less critical and impartial than they would 
have been, offered as general history to indifferent 
or unfriendly readers. Churchmen frequently suffer 
from being closely connected with a great church 
whose greatness they fully appreciate. Like a mem- 
ber of a large college, or the citizen of a large city, 
they become confused in their standards of meas- 
urement. Our author says of Queen Elizabeth, that 
" she put none to death for religious convictions ; 
if there were some that died for their opinions, it 
was not because those opinions were religious, but 
because they were political." 

The next author we have to consider, Rev. John 
W. Chadwick, incidentally affirms that good Queen 
Bess burned one Arian in 1583 and another in 



1585. Unitarianism is not a belief it is the free- 
dom of belief, the liberty to pursue truth in one's 
own way through all its wide field. It is natural 
that such a faith should call out bold, earnest spirits, 
and that they should feel much confidence and en- 
thusiasm in their intellectual attitude. They inhale 
mountain air, and cannot but exult in its tonic force. 
When they are able to unite to this temper, tender- 
ness and a wide sympathy with the wants of men, 
they become very lovable. Few among them sur- 
pass, in these best characteristics of their kind, Mr. 
John W. Chadwick. His latest volume is a history 
of Unitarians, broken into parts and shaped to the 
definite purpose of impressing anew upon his audi- 
ence some pregnant principle, imparting a large 
outlook. One who has sought for truth diligently 
and found it with difficulty may well have an en- 
thusiasm of presentation quite his own. The first 
discourse and the last discourse are more general, 
but the intermediate ones take up particular sub- 
jects " The Doctrine of Man," " Concerning God," 
" The Future Life," and consider them first in 
their historical development, and then press them 
home as the victories of spiritual life. The whole 
soul of the author is in this gathering in of sheaves. 
Take the passage under The Bible: 

" And still, though much is taken, much abides for 
those who are capable of serious study: a splendid pro- 
sess of religious evolution sweeping through a thousand 
years of busy, checkered time. Never at any time be- 
fore was the study of the Bible so rich and so reward- 
ing as it is now, and never before was it pursued among 
us with such enthusiasm and such large results " (page 
107). 

Or this passage, under " The Doctrine of Man ": 

" For I hold that nothing is more sure than this : that 
underlying and overtopping every other necessity of our 
industrial organization is the necessity, on the part of 
the employer, of seeing in every workman at his forges 
or his looms, in his quarries or his mines, not merely so 
much ' labor,' and not merely an industrial machine, 
but a fellow-creature, a human being, a conscious soul, 
a brother man whom he must not treat with any least 
indignity or disrespect" (page 43). 

The two remaining volumes are practical. The 
first, " Religious Progress," is a comprehensive, 
penetrative, and admirable estimate of Christian de- 
velopment, and men's part in it, as made up of con- 
flicting yet compensatory forces. The synthesis of 
high character and of spiritual growth is not pri- 
marily a logical one, but a coalescing of many 
forces in a wide upward movement. We press for- 
ward by some hidden insight ; we harken backward 
to things we were ready to lose ; we close up the 
ranks and once more renew the march. 

" It is a lesson we are slow to learn, that opposites 
are closely, even vitally related; that hostile attitudes 
which seem irreconcilable may both be true. Our own 
experience or the experience of history may reveal to 
us the ease, the naturalness of the transition from one 
extreme to another" (page 9). 

"But, at least, the lessons of history, the experience 
of the Church, our own individual experience as well,

may teach us, and comfort us by teaching, that oppos- 
ing aspects of truth do not neutralize or destroy each 
other. The reformers who speak so confidently about 
this or that phase of ecclesiastical thought or practice 
as destined soon to disappear, may be, and probably in 
most cases are, too sanguine" (page 112). 

" When we discern the true value of our differences, 
while we shall hold them more firmly, we shall also 
more easily subordinate them to the higher virtue of 
Christian charity" (page 137). 

The last work on our list is made up of Sermons 
by Canon Liddon, touching chiefly clerical service. 
An ardent, consecrated temper comes forth in this 
volume. We feel that we are in contact with one 
whose soul is pushing forth toward life, the life of 
us all. 

One may easily feel, when reading the words of 
Unitarians, these men are too belligerent, too con- 
stantly stripped to the waist, too intensely and un- 
brokenly intellectual ; that the soul does not live by 
bread alone. Many flawed and broken walls are 
overturned, but what of the vines that clung to 
them ? One wishes the fellowship of devout serv- 
ants of truth, to sit, for a little, where faith and life 
unfold themselves quietly under unseen forces, and 
raise no questions of doubt. Such a desire the words 
of Robertson and of Liddon meet and satisfy. 
Listening to them, we care not particularly whether 
the strength of the underlying thought is absolute 
or not. Few cables are so strong that they cannot 
be strained, and some fibre snapped ; but we swing 
by them in safety all the same. JOHN BASCOM. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Dante complete 
in one volume. 



" Tutte le Opere di Dante Alighieri 
Nuovamente Rivedute nel Testo da 
[why not dal ?] Dr. E. Moore" 
(Macmillan) such is the title of a volume just 
issued from the Oxford University Press. The whole 
works of Dante, Italian and Latin, within a single 
pair of covers if the thing has ever been done be- 
fore, it has escaped our notice ; certainly it has never 
been done, as now, in " un volume portatile, e quasi 
tascabile." And since it was left to be done by an 
Englishman, the unanimous suffrage of students will 
agree that Dr. Moore wa!S facile princeps among 
those competent to do it. The book, in which not a 
word of English occurs, contains three things : an 
Introduction by the editor, the Works, and an Index 
of proper names and cose notabill by Mr. Paget 
Toynbee. There are 490 double-columned pages 
of fifty-one lines each, something less than half the 
matter in the " Globe " Shakespeare. The type is 
small but readable, being somewhat larger faced as 
well as leaded. Dr. Moore has been catholic in his 
inclusions, and gives us everything that any student 
of Dante is likely to expect, even the "Quaestio de 
Aqua et Terra," " I Sette Salmi Penetenziali," and 
the " Prof essione di Fede," robaccia though the lat- 
ter be. Only the "Letter" to Guido da Polenta is 



missing ; and this, as the editor says, " no one would 
hesitate to condemn in Scartazzini's energetic terms 
as sciocca impostura." Dr. Moore expresses his atti- 
tude towards criticism of the canon, when he says 
that " the negative dogmatism of recent critics is no 
less to be condemned than the too easy credulity 
of the ancients." In which opinion we, having in 
mind, among other things, Herr Scartazzini's re- 
jection of the Letter ; < Amico Florentine," most 
heartily concur. We might say parenthetically, that 
other editors would do well to adopt Dr. Moore's 
attitude towards the canon of his author. Dr. Skeat's 
" Chaucer," for example, would have been made far 
more useful had it included the text of the disputed 
and even of the rejected works. Dr. Moore has 
taken his text from many sources. Witte is fol- 
lowed with minute variations, for the "Vita Nuova," 
the " De Monarchia," and the " Commedia." But 
in the case of the latter work, the editor has felt 
justified in going outside the four texts followed by 
Witte, and in introducing emendations from the 
various texts that have come to light since Witte's 
publication of 1862. For the minor works, the text 
of Fraticelli is mainly followed, supplemented by 
the Grenoble Codex for the " De Vulgari Eloquio." 
The disposition of the " Canzonieri " has been en- 
trusted to Mr. York Powell. The hardest work of 
the editor has been done with " II Convito." He 
has made what may fairly be called a reconstruction 
of the text, although always working in a spirit of 
admirable conservatism, and brought into compari- 
son for the first time the two codices owned in En- 
gland, one by the editor, the other by the Bodleian. 
These codices, with readings from Fraticelli, Giu- 
liani, and others, with the aid of Witte's " Centuriae 
Correctionum," and of the " Saggio " of the Milan- 
ese editors, constitute the basis of the new text, which 
is no unimportant jewel in the crown of Dr. Moore's 
scholarship. A word must be said of Mr. Toynbee's 
Index, for which every student will be thankful. It 
is an index of proper names and of subjects, whether 
mentioned by name or merely referred to, and in 
the latter case, allusions merely conjectural are dis- 
criminated from those of which there is no doubt. 
The entries " Papa " and " Papi," for example, 
" Cristo," " Dio," and " Virgilio," bring together 
all' references to those subjects throughout the works. 
This is a feature of great value, and, as there are 
no notes, is the only piece of apparatus supplied. 
Dr. Moore's edition of Dante certainly ought to be- 
come the standard work for textual reference, just 
as the " Globe " Shakespeare has so become in its 
own department.

the triumphs achieved by investigation and the in- 
ductive method during the present century, and a 



216 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



statement of the attitude toward fundamental ques- 
tions of philosophy that the truly scientific thinker 
(according to Professor Haeckel) is bound to as- 
sume. The writer is firmly convinced that this 
"monistic confession" is shared "by at least nine- 
tenths of the men of science now living." In fact, 
the writer believes it to be shared " by all men of 
science in whom the following four conditions are 
realized: (1) Sufficient acquaintance with the vari- 
ous departments of natural science, and in particu- 
lar with the modern doctrine of evolution ; (2) Suf- 
ficient acuteness and clearness of judgment to draw, 
by induction and deduction, the necessary logical 
consequences that flow from such empirical knowl- 
edge; (3) Sufficient moral courage to maintain the 
monistic knowledge, so gained, against the attacks 
of hostile dualistic and pluralistic systems ; and (4) 
Sufficient strength of mind to free himself, by sound, 
independent reasoning, from dominant religious 
prejudices, and especially from those irrational 
dogmas which have been firmly lodged in our minds 
from earliest youth as indisputable revelations." 
This is certainly an excellent statement of the con- 
ditions under which a man may claim to be in full 
possession of the fund of scientific knowledge pain- 
fully accumulated by the ages, but we fear that the 
author is unduly optimistic in his claim that " nine- 
tenths of the men of science now living " can meet 
all four conditions. As for the monistic system so 
frankly set forth in Professor Haeckel's essay, it 
is undoubtedly a fair statement of that view of the 
universe as an object upon which all the sciences seem 
to converge. But besides this " Welt als Vorstel- 
lung " there is the world in its inner subjective as- 
pect Schopenhauer's " Welt als Wille " and Kant's 
" Ding an Sich "; and of this world, or even of the 
possibility of its existence, Professor Haeckel's es- 
say gives no intimation. To him, the world of mat- 
ter, the world of differentiated ether and energy, is 
the one real thing ; that this world is conditioned by 
the subject, and inconceivable apart from the subject, 
is a view that seems to be unintelligible to our ma- 
terialistic monist, although it is the view of every 
deep thinker whose name has left an impress upon 
the history of philosophy. 

With the exception of a flying visit 
made in 1874 by H. M. S. Challenger, 
the Antarctic regions have been neg- 
lected by scientists since Ross's expedition in 1839- 
1843. An incident of commerce led, in the autumn 
of 1892, to a slight renewal of scientific interest. 
A fleet of four whalers was sent out from Dundee, 
Scotland, to search the Antarctic seas for Bowhead 
whales which may be termed, for the benefit of 
the ignorant, " whalebone whales," with " golden 
heads" in every sense, for these whales are worth 
three thousand pounds apiece, thanks to Dame 
Fashion. They did not see one Bowhead though 
they were in the ice over two months nor any 
other whales of any value, or worth catching; and 
the expedition cost twenty-eight thousand pounds. 



Antarctic seas. 



They found and captured plenty of seals, which 
were not, however, fur-seals ; and the killing of 
them proved tedious, exhausting, dirty, bloody, and 
brutal work. Important scientific results or data 
appear to have been as lacking as the Bowheads. 
The story of the trip has been told and illustrated 
by the artist of the expedition, Mr. W. G. Burn 
Murdoch, in a work entitled " From Edinburgh to 
the Antarctic" (Longmans) . It is amusing through 
its descriptions of sailor's life, though it is not wholly 
novel in narration. Much adscititious "padding" 
in the shape of well-worn sailors' yarns exceed- 
ingly ancient junk of the merchant-service is pre- 
served in the amber of the pages. And much gen- 
eral flippancy of diction detracts from the serious- 
ness of description and impression ; but the author 
begs for some change, as it is "so tedious always 
writing about snow and mist and bleeding seals." 
Perhaps he should be allowed to use Sydney 
Smith's phrase "to speak disrespectfully of the 
Poles." The book is handsomely printed, and the 
illustrations are spirited though, from the confined 
scope of boats and ice, somewhat monotonous. The 
work closes with an appeal for a national scientific 
expedition to the Antarctic regions, "to show that 
the Britain of to-day is not behind the Britain of 
our fathers."

du Creole dans les Antilles," written by M. Rend de 
Poyen-Bellisle of the University of Chicago, and 
published by Messrs. John Murphy & Co., Balti- 
more. The author is a native of Guadeloupe, and 
combines an intimate knowledge of the language of 
the negro as he heard it in infancy and childhood, 
with a scientific training in phonetics and general 
linguistics. Of chief interest to the general reader 
are the appended specimens of fables, rhymes, pro- 
verbs, and enigmas, which constitute most of the 
material for the investigation. We meet the charac- 
ters of " Br'er Rabbit " and " Br'er Fox," so familiar 
in the folk-lore of the negroes in the Southern States, 
in Compere Lapin and Compere Zamba of the 
Guadeloupe fable ; and the story of " The Tar Baby " 
appears essentially as it iS given in "Uncle Remus." 
The proverbs and enigmas are charming in their 
na'ivete, and some of them have almost a poetic 
quality, as, " The white man's eyes burn into those 
of the negro," or " There is one who burns his heart 
for the pleasure of the company : Answer, a can- 
dle." The treatment of sounds and inflections is ex- 
haustive, and is full of interest and instruction to 
the student of language. The author shows con- 
clusively that the language of the negro slave of 
Guadeloupe is unmixed French (which is not true of 
any of the other "Creole" dialects), being an 
adaptation of the speech of his master to his own 
primitive needs and capacity ; and he has succeeded 
in explaining many disguised words and phrases

which might lead a more superficial observer to 
suspect African or other influence. We commend 
the study as a model to those who wish to contrib- 
ute something of real value to the knowledge of 
dialects and folk-lore. 



Travels in the 
Sandwich Islands. 



Open disdain of travels and travellers 
has often been held to be character- 
istic of the English people. It cer- 
tainly has been of more than one great literary man. 
Quoth the great Dr. Johnson, pointing contemptu- 
ously to three volumes of Voyages to the South Sea, 
" Who will read them ? there can be little enter- 
tainment in them; one set of savages is just like 
another." Yet the book of Mrs. Isabella Bird 
Bishop on " Six Months in the Sandwich Islands " 
(Putnam) has been through five editions in England 
before its present reprint in America. It was writ- 
ten over twenty years ago ; and thus is not old 
enough to have acquired any of the dignity of an- 
cient history, nor is it new enough to have any fresh- 
ness. It is in the form of letters written to a sis- 
ter ; and had its four hundred and twenty pages 
been shortened by judicious " editing " it would have 
been more interesting. The really important chap- 
ters are those that relate to the visits to, explora- 
tions around, and inquiries about the volcanoes. 
These wonders she explored most thoroughly and 
intelligently, and gives her reports of them in clear 
and vivid sentences. Her accounts of sociological 
and ethnological details are not specially valuable, 
because her visit was made at a time when the 
islanders were already much affected by civilized, 
religious, social, and mental training. Her account 
of the Leper settlement, for example, seems very 
bare, for we now know so much more of its effects 
and results. Dr. Johnson's dictum that " one set of 
savages is just like another" seems true; for the 
customs of the Hawaiian savages recounted in this 
book bear a strong resemblance to those related by 
Pierre Loti, at the same date, of the island of Ta- 
hiti; but the transcendent glamour of the beautiful 
French romance is wholly lacking in these prosaic 
letters. 

Mr. Herbert P. Home has produced, 
in "The Binding of Books" (Scrib- 
ner's Sons), what is doubtless the 
most comprehensive and valuable essay on the dec- 
orative features of bookbinding that has appeared 
in English. The subject is one of continually grow- 
ing interest, and there have been many valuable 
contributions to its literature since Miss Prideaux 
compiled her bibliography. Mr. Home's work is 
quite technical in character as is to be inferred from 
its sub-title, " An Essay in the History of Gold- 
Tooled Bindings." It deals familiarly with such 
mysteries of the craft as " making up and sewing," 
"backing and rounding," "beating," "lacing," 
" heading - banding," " covering," etc., which are 
treated with considerable detail in the opening 
chapter. Other chapters are devoted to early Italian 
bindings, French bindings, and English bindings. 



Decorative 
bookbinding. 



Mr. Home believes, with many others, that since 
the death of Le Gascon, somewhat grandiloquently 
styled " the Evening Star of bookbinding in France," 
little progress has been made in original designing. 
" More inspiration and less perspiration " is urged 
as necessary to a revival of the art, and this we can- 
not hope for until book-lovers and patrons of the art 
are willing to employ creative artists instead of imi- 
tative artisans. Readers of Mr. Home's pages will 
note an unpleasant peculiarity in the excessive use 
of commas, colons, semi-colons, etc., making his text 
strongly suggestive of that pointelle style of deco- 
ration more appropriate on the covers. They will, 
however, pardon more than this for the interest and 
value of his work. 



Life of 
Macready. 



Among those who have rendered en- 
during services to dramatic art and 
literature, the name of Macready 
will always hold a high place. He had lofty ideals, 
not only of acting but of dramatic composition. 
He strove to elevate and increase the acting reper- 
tory of the English stage, and in this admirable 
and disinterested endeavor he enlisted the services 
of Bulwer, Sheridan Knowles, and Talfourd, some 
of whose best plays were written at his suggestion 
or with his collaboration. The story of these labors 
forms the most pleasing portions of Mr. W. T. 
Price's " Life of William Charles Macready " ( Bren- 
tano's). But while Macready as a force in dra- 
matic art merits our praise, unfortunately Macready 
as a man excites quite other feelings. The morbid- 
ness, the temper, and other unhappy traits of his 
character, can be regarded only with aversion. 
But, as his biographer justly remarks, "Any honest 
life of Macready must treat with equal frankness 
his distinct characteristics as an actor and as a man." 
And so by this volume once more we are forced to 
wonder that one personality could be compounded 
of elements so worthy and so petty. The book is 
not well written ; Mr. Price's English constructions 
are so peculiar, and often so incorrect, that the 
reader is vexed at the poor use of good material. 
The publisher's part, however, is well done.

described on the title page as "a

analytical and critical studies of the writers, with 
introduction and notes." This title leaves little to 
add by way of explanation of the editor's aim. The 
" analytical and critical studies " are, however, so 
very brief as to be of little value. They exhibit a 
tendency to take too seriously some very minor poets, 
and an occasional freakishness of judgment. The 
work has five sections. There are "Classics" 
(Bryant, Whittier, Emerson^ Poe, Very, Longfel- 
low, Lowell, Holmes), "Preeminent Later Writers " 
(Whitman, Taylor, Lanier), "Forerunners " ( Fre- 
neau, Halleck, Drake, Saxe, and a dozen more),

Mr. Stoddard, Mr. Aldrich, Mr. Gilder, Mr. Wood-

singers have but a single poem each, and it is some- 
times surprising to note the editor's selection. The 
facts stated are accurate, as far as we have ob- 
served. We may note that the deaths of Lucy Lar- 
com and Celia Thaxter are not recorded. The book

Etiquette in Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren's stand- 

Wash^ngton. a i rvaj i 

ard manual ot " Ihe bocial-Onicial 
Etiquette of the United States" (Murphy & Co., 
Baltimore). A moment's reflection makes the uses 
of Mrs. Dahlgren's book apparent. Washington 
etiquette being, as the author shows, largely a thing 
apart and sui generis, it is plain that one may be 
enviably au fait of social usages generally, and 
still be as ignorant as a Comanche of those pecul- 
iar to the federal capital. Mrs. Dahlgren sets 
forth the special rules of the Washington code 
clearly and explicitly; and where the authorities 
differ as on certain nice points of official prece- 
dence still unsettled she debates the matter pro 
and con with great constitutional learning and a 
becoming sense of the gravity of her theme. To 
the newly-returned member and his aspiring family 
the little book should prove a real blessing. For- 
tified by its precepts, the novice may venture upon 
the troubled sea of the semi-official society of Wash- 
ington with a comparatively light heart. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A beautiful cover imitative of Venetian mosaic, a 
great number of charming illustrations, and two hun- 
dred and fifty pages of rather indifferent text, are the 
gifts brought to us by " Venezia," a sumptuous quarto 
volume imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 
The text, except for a brief and perfunctory introduc- 
tion by Mr. H. D. Traill, is " adapted " from the Ger- 
man of Herr Henry Perl by Mrs. Arthur Bell. The 
illustrations, more than two hundred in number, are by 
well-known Italian artists of the modern school, and 
certainly give us a most lifelike picture of the Venice 
and the Venetians of to-day. 

Our recent lengthy review of Dr. Skeat's edition of 
Chaucer makes superfluous any critical comment upon 
the one-volume edition of the text now published (Mac- 
millan), and gracefully dedicated to the University of 
Halle in return for the honorary degree last year con- 
ferred by that institution upon the editor. We now 
have, in a single compact tome, the entire text of 
Chaucer in 732 double-columned pages; an introduction 
of 22 pages on biography, grammar, verse, and pronun- 
ciation; and a "Glossarial Index " of 149 pages. All 
students of English poetry will be grateful for this edi- 
tion, which, for the first time in five centuries, offers a 
good text at a moderate price. 

The ground covered by Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's 
popular work on " The Sabbath in Puritan New En- 
gland " is again gone over, in some respects more 



minutely, in others less, by Mr. William Root Bliss, 
in his " Side Glimpses from the New England Meeting- 
House " (Houghton). Mr. Bliss dedicates his book to 
Mrs. Earle, whom he styles " My fellow traveller along 
the byways and hedges of Colonial New England." 
Whether or no we are to infer that the volume is in 
some sort the result of actual collaboration is not quite 
clear. 

A little book called "Theatrical Sketches". (The 
Merriam Company) is a collection of stories about the 
stage and stage people, derived apparently in large 
part from personal knowledge. Being well told, and 
as a rule somewhat amusing, they will serve to enter- 
tain those who take pleasure in gossip of this kind. The 
illustrations consist of good pictures of Messrs. Kyrle 
Belle w, James W. Morrissey, and Maurice Barrymore; 
also of Lester Wallack, Edwin Booth, and Dion Bouci- 
cault, each in some favorite character. 

" Bartholomew Fair," " Cynthia's Revels," and " Se- 
janus " fill the second volume of the " Mermaid " selec- 
tion from the plays of Ben Jonson (imported by Scrib- 
ner). A third volume will complete the selection, and 
we may incidentally remark that it will round to a full 
score the volumes of this admirable series. Professor 
Herford, who edited the first of the Jonson volumes, 
has withdrawn from the work, and no editor's name now 
appears upon the title-page, although the brief intro- 
ductions to the separate plays are in the first person. 
The frontispiece is a portrait of Richard Burbage. 

"Ideals and Institutions: Their Parallel Develop- 
ment," is the title of a dissertation presented to the 
University of Minnesota by Mr. John Ernest Merrill, 
and now issued from the Hartford Seminary Press. The 
author has made a careful study of Greek, Roman, and 
Teutonic institutions, and the essential part of his pre- 
liminary thesis is that the institution is the product of 
the antecedent national ideal, although of course he 
does not refuse to admit that the former may react 
upon the latter. The treatment of the subject is largely 
metaphysical as well as historical, and these two phases 
are, in fact, discussed in separate sections of the work. 
Numerous tables and charts summarize the investiga- 
tions made by the writer, and a list of authorities is 
appended. 

The essay on Giovanni Boccaccio as Man and Author 
(imported by Scribner), of which the literary executors 
of John Addington Symonds have made a thin octavo 
volume, is little more than a re-statement of the matter 
already familiar to readers of Symonds's great history 
of the Renaissance. It is, in a way, interesting to have 
the matter all by itself, but one cannot help thinking 
that a book devoted solely to the immortal author of 
" II Decamerone " ought to be a good deal more of a 
book than this one proves to be. The main facts are 
here, and the most obvious comments, but little more, 
and there is so much more to say! 

The " Smithsonian Report" for 1893 is of double the 
usual size, and is one of the most valuable documents 
lately issued from the Government Printing Office. The 
value, of course, resides in the Appendix, with its re- 
prints of the most important scientific papers of the 
year, noticeable among which is Mr. Otis T. Mason's 
" North American Bows, Arrows, and Quivers," with 
over fifty full-page plates. Flying machines, Arctic 
exploration, biological stations, photography, meteor- 
ology, anthropology, and Oriental scholarship, are a few 
of the subjects dealt with in the remaining papers.

YORK TOPICS. 

New York, March 25, 1895. 

The pressure of topics requiring " mention " has never 
been greater than during the present Spring publishing 
season. One looks, almost with dismay, on the incom- 
ing rush of announcements of new books, which flutter 
down like the doves of San Marco at the breakfast hour. 
So it behooves one to disregard them for the present, 
and confine one's attention to a few subjects of insist- 
ant importance. 

The bill making possible the incorporation of " The 
New York Public Library: Astor, Lenox, and Tilden 
Foundation," has passed our Senate and House, and now 
awaits Governor Morton's signature. The consolidated 
board of trustees is to be composed of twenty-one mem- 
bers seven for each of the original foundations. The en- 
dowments and property interests represent, as already 
stated in this correspondence, about $8,000,000. The 
interest from all the productive investments amounts to 
about $140,000 annually. Should the Lenox Library 
building and land be sold, this would be vastly in- 
creased. And herein lies the crucial point of the whole 
question. Will the city of New York give this public 
library a site in a central and accessible part of the 
city? When I say city, I include much more than Man- 
hattan Island and Westchester county. In a certain 
sense, all of Long Island and half of the state of New 
Jersey are now a part of the Greater New York. A 
few details are needed here. There is at the corner of 
Fifth avenue and Forty-second street, within one min- 
ute's walk of the Grand Central Station, a stone struc- 
ture known as the " receiving reservoir." It has long 
been useless, having been supplanted many years ago 
by our present aqueduct system. It covers a space of 
ground which would permit of a library containing four 
millions of books. It adjoins Bryant Park, one of our 
city squares. On either side run the longitudinal ele- 
vated railroad systems which connect the Battery with 
the North Side and Westchester county. Various street- 
car lines run east and west on Forty-second street, con- 
necting with all other tramways and with all our fer- 
ries. In fact, this place is both the physical and the 
geographical centre of New York. In any other city, 
this site would be inevitable for such a purpose ; but 
after letting this useless stone structure lie where it is 
for twenty years, objection is now made to giving the 



site for a library, on the ground that the land is needed 
to enlarge Bryant Park. The reservoir plot is now un- 
doubtedly the most valuable piece of land in the city. 
To purchase an equally convenient site would require 
an appropriation for which ten times the amount of land 
could be bought in the tenement districts of the city 
where small parks are needed. With the reservoir 
site, and with the aid of the stone of which the reservoir 
is built, the trustees could erect a noble building, suit- 
able for its purpose, and without encroaching upon their 
invested funds. This plan, of course, would involve 
the sale of the Lenox Library site. I trust that those 
people who are opposing this inspiring plan will think 
better of their action. 

While the mercantile and commercial districts of 
New York are extending up-town, the increasing popu- 
lations of Long Island and New Jersey long since made 
it plain that the business centre of the city must remain 
far below Central Park. The lofty buildings now go- 
ing up all over the lower end of Manhattan Island are 
an unfailing indication of this. The lower part of the 
city will thus be the centre of a population spreading 
in every direction except the southeast. Meanwhile, 
the publishing houses have established their own busi- 
ness centre along Fifth avenue and the adjacent streets, 
from Eighth street to Twenty-third street. A few 
still remain in the vicinity of Astor Place. Among 
these latter are Messrs. George Routledge's Sons ; the 
Funk & Wagnalls Co. ; Henry T. Thomas ; E. B. 
Treat ; E. & J. B. Young & Co. ; Arthur Hinds ; 
Frederick Warne & Co. ; Thomas Whittaker ; E. R. 
Pelton ; the Humboldt Publishing Co. ; great printing 
houses like Theodore L. De Vinne & Co. and J. J. Lit- 
tle & Co. ; and such periodicals as " The Outlook," 
"The Review of Reviews," "The Literary Digest," 
"Current Literature," "Public Opinion," and "The 
Churchman." Around the corner from these, on Broad- 
way, are the American Book Company and Charles T. 
Dillingham, but the former will soon remove its quar- 
ters further up-town. Beginning with Ninth street, 
between Broadway and Fifth avenue, the peripatetic 
author in quest of a publisher may observe the sign- 
boards of Messrs. Bryan, Taylor & Co. ; E. L. Kellog 
& Co. ; Rand, McNally & Co. ; A. C. Armstrong & 
Son ; A. S. Barnes & Co. ; John Wiley & Sons ; Fords, 
Howard & Hulbert ; Maynard, Merrill & Co. ; William 
Wood & Co. ; A. Lovell & Co. ; D. C. Heath & Co. ; 
D. G. Francis ; Macmillan & Co. ; Brentano's ; The 
Century Co. ; Ginn & Co. ; Transatlantic Publishing 
Co. ; D. Appleton & Co. ; Merrill & Baker ; The Mer- 
riam Co. ; Leach, Shewell & Sanborn ; J. Selwin 
Tait & Sons ; Wm. Beverley Harrison ; the Judge 
Publishing Co.; Cassell Publishing Co. ; Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co.; Longmans, Green, & Co.; Thomas Nelson & 
Sons ; Wm. Evarts Benjamin ; T. Y. Crowell & Co. ; 
the Baker & Taylor Co. ; the Werner Co. ; the Flem- 
ing H. Revell Co. ; James Pott & Co. ; Lovell, Cory- 
ell & Co. ; Hunt & Eaton ; Dodd, Mead & Co. ; Charles 
Scribner's Sons; A. D. F. Randolph Co.; G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons ; E. P. Dutton & Co. ; Henry Holt & Co. ; 
George W. Dillingham ; and about one hundred maga- 
zines and periodicals, a score of which are known the 
world over. 

Now, what an absurdity it would be, in spite of the 
fact that our new library is to be a popular institution, 
to shove it up above the lower end of Central Park, 
and out of reach of all these publishing houses and 
their myriad workers ! ARTHUR STEDMAN.

UNIVERSITY LIFE AT LEIPZIG. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

Leipzig, March 10, 1895. 

The University of Leipzig was founded in 1409, by 
German scholars from Prag, who left that city dur- 
ing the Huss troubles. It immediately took high rank 
among the universities of Europe, and is to-day the 
third in Germany in point of numbers, Berlin and Mu- 
nich standing ahead. Most of the revenues come from 
lands granted the university in its early days by one of 
the Electors, and from valuable property in the very 
heart of the city. The annual income is stated at about 
two hundred thousand dollars, which seems at first 
thought a small sum for the maintenance of so large 
an institution; but in view of the comparatively small 
pay-roll, the amount assumes larger proportions. The 
uninitiated, in looking over the Verzeichness (calendar), 
might wonder where the money comes from which is 
necessary to salary such an army of teachers. But the 
surprise ceases on learning that only the professors or- 
dinarius receive salaries, the professors extraordinarius 
and the privat-docents having only student fees for com- 
pensation. For example, under the head of Germanic 
Philology nine names appear, but only three are those 
of professors proper. The amount of the salary differs 
among the different professorships, which vary greatly 
in this respect, some of them being heavily endowed by 
private benefactors. The head professor of Philosophy 
receives from the university about twenty-five hundred 
dollars, which amount is swelled to over four thousand 
by fees. The latter are comparatively small. The stu- 
dent pays, on entering the university, a matriculation 
fee of twenty marks ; and for each course he hears dur- 
ing his residence, four marks an hour, with a mark and 
a half added for the Famulus and use of a seat. Thus, 
if the course occupies five hours a week, he pays twenty- 
one and a half marks for the whole semester. The 
Seminars are free, with the exception of the one mark 
for the Famulus. The latter is a relic of the middle 
ages. He is always a student, presumably poor and 
deserving, and serves the professor as a sort of private 
janitor. He looks after the ventilation, keeps the black- 
board clean, posts notices, and performs other services 
of a similar character. A more dignified office of the 
Famulus is that of go-between for professor and student. 
The latter never addresses the former on the street or 
university premises. If the student must see the pro- 
fessor in person, he makes a formal call at the latter's 
place of residence. Otherwise all inquiries are ad- 
dressed to the Famulus, who alone has acccess to the 
sacred presence. There is no hovering about the pro- 
fessor's desk, or speaking with him in the corridors. 
On the very minute for the beginning of the lecture, 
the Famulus opens the door, the professor enters, as- 
cends the rostrum, begins " Meine Herren," closes at 
the stroke of the bell, gathers up his manuscript, 
and is gone amid the applause (made by the feet) of 
the audience. In the Seminars, at the arrival and de- 
parture of the professor, everybody stands. This pro- 
fessional sacredness is said not to exist at the younger 
universities, and is especially characteristic of Leipzig. 

The university has but little to boast of in the way 
of architecture. The Augusteum, the seat of the Phil- 
osophical Faculty, is in process of reconstruction. It 
will be a fine building when completed. In the mean- 
time the lectures are held in an old hospital, without 
comfort or convenience. The seats are the rudest 



benches in the style of those used in the country school- 
houses of long ago. Perhaps the oldest of the univer- 
sity buildings is the Church of St. Paul, originally be- 
longing to the monastery of like name, which was ab- 
sorbed by the university in its early days. In this plain 
old church the university preacher holds service every 
Sunday morning. Not long ago it was the scene of the 
funeral of the late Professor Hildebrand, on which oc- 
casion the long procession of Verein students, with gay 
colored caps, high boots, swords, and banners, contrasted 
strangely with the somber edifice and solemn ceremony. 

The student does not play so important a role in Leip- 
zig as in the smaller university towns. Still, he is very 
much in evidence on the streets, where he is inclined to 
occupy more space than rightfully belongs to him. The 
majority of the students are members of some Verein, 
but only a comparatively small number wear colors. 
The object of most of these societies is serious, although 
the convivial element is not neglected. The corps stu- 
dent with slashed face is not prominent. 

The daily life of the German student is not attractive. 
He rents a room, usually of humble people, who furnish 
him his morning coffee; his dinner he eats at some res- 
taurant; buys his supper, of rye bread and sausage, on 
the way home from his late lecture or afternoon's loung- 
ing, and eats it alone, without the encumbrance of 
knife, fork, and plate. Unless he has friends in the city, 
or brings with him letters of introduction, he has no so- 
ciety outside of his fellow-students. But this satisfies 
him, and he is never at a loss for entertainment. If all 
else fail, the Kneipe is always open, and ready to furnish 
its peculiar solace. The average student does not ex- 
pect to work much during the first semester, and often 
the Bummelzeit lasts longer. Unless he belongs to the 
fast set, he attends lectures with a fair amount of reg- 
ularity, and keeps up his notes, but that is all. While 
this sounds to his disadvantage, it really has some ex- 
cuse. After the long grind in the gymnasium, the young 
German is entitled to some lightening of labor. He 
finds plenty of opportunity to dig before his university 
career is over. There are scholarships and funds for 
poor students; also the Convict, an eating-house where 
free dinners are furnished to those holding tickets. Our 
American system of self-help is unknown. To perform 
any kind of manual labor would be a disgrace. 

The relation between student and professor is a dis- 
tant one. The two seldom come together, except on 
formal occasions. The professor has perhaps a slight 
acquaintance with all the members of his Seminar, and 
may entertain them occasionally at his home. There 
are a few grand social functions during each semester, 
to which those students with social introductions are 
invited. Among them are the Professorium, a faculty 
reception and ball, when the young men have the op- 
portunity of meeting the professors' wives and dancing 
with their daughters. 

Following the example of his predecessor, the learned 
King John, the present King visits the university once a 
year in the capacity of Rector Magnificissimus. He at- 
tends a few lectures, especially those of newly appointed 
professors, and inspects any changes or improvements 
made during the year. Naturally these are important 
occasions for both student and professor. Not long ago 
the writer assisted at one of these visits. His Majesty in 
uniform, accompanied by her Majesty, attended by a 
numerous suite, and escorted by the Rector Magnificus 
wearing his chain of office, was made comfortable in an 
arm-chair before the reading-desk. The Herr Professor

appeared in a dress suit and white gloves, and the Fam- 
ulus in a long-tailed coat of black broadcloth. The lec- 
ture proceeded as usual and was closed by a rousing 
Hoch to their Majesties. 

To the above some facts may be added concerning 
the status of women at the University of Leipzig. Their 
attendance has always been in theory forbidden; but 
professors fell into the practice of failing to discover 
their presence in the lecture halls. Three years ago, 
eleven women were thus pursuing studies, expecting to 
secure degrees from less conservative institutions for 
work which was actually done at Leipzig. This group 
included American, English, and Russian women, and 
one daughter of the Fatherland, Friiulein Kathe Wind- 
schied, who secured the doctor's degree a year ago at 
the University of Heidelberg. Recently, conservatism 
has increased. Young women who were seeking only 
a veneer of foreign culture had begun to swell the num- 
ber in attendance at lectures. Professors took their 
patronage of the more attractive courses for light treat- 
ment of serious things. Some of them have therefore 
excluded all representatives of the sex even from the 
rule of unseen listeners. At present four women, two 
from the United States, one from England, and one 
from Germany, are attending courses of lectures which 
they have chosen with the purpose of taking degrees 
at other universities. An eminent professor told one 
of these that if she entered his lecture room he would 
not see her. As for the higher education of women, 
he did not disapprove of it under all circumstances; 
but in Germany the professions were already crowded 
and offered them no place for a career. Therefore, to 
prepare for professional life would only increase their

" Maarten Maartens," for the first time in years, has 
passed the winter in Holland. 

The members of the Authors Club of New York will 
give a reception to their friends the publishers, on the 
eleventh of this month. 

Professor Blackie is said some time ago to have 
turned his papers over to a friend, with a view to the 
preparation of a biography. 

Mr. G. von Gizycki, of Berlin, well-known among 
the leaders of the " ethical movement," died on the 3rd 
of March, at the age of forty-three. 

A new volume of poems by Mr. Louis J. Block, en- 
titled " The New World, with Other Verse," will be 
published this Spring by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

The German societies of New York have offered to 
the municipality a Heine monument. The offer has 
been accepted, and the monument, which Diisseldorf 
refused, will be placed in Central Park. 

The expected biography of the late Professor Free- 
man, by Dr. Stephens, to be issued by Messrs. Macmil- 
lan & Co., will contain many extracts from Mr. Free- 
man's correspondence on literary, historical, and general 
topics. 

Mr. Charlemagne Tower, Jr., whose work on Lafay- 
ette is reviewed in this issue of THE DIAL, is a resident 
of Philadelphia, and has been in turn a lawyer, a railway 
president, and a student of history. He is forty-six 
years of age. 

We are glad to note the performances of old English 



plays that are among the many indications of the good 
work now being done by the English departments of 
our colleges. A few days ago, Jonson's " Silent Woman " 
was given by Harvard students ; while May will wit- 
ness a performance of "Ralph Roister Doister" at 
Tufts College, under the direction of Professor D. L. 
Maulsby. 

Without any ambitious attempt to emulate Mrs. 
Humphry Ward's achievement in "Marcella," "Tran- 
sition," a forthcoming novel by the author of " A Su- 
perfluous Woman," is said to have been written with 
the express purpose of giving a truer account of the 
workings of a socialist mind, and the methods adopted 
in particular by the scientific socialists of the day, than 
Mrs. Ward was in a position to do. 

The new Societa Dantesca d'ltalia has planned a col- 
lation of about 400 selected passages of the " Divina 
Commedia " in all the manuscripts known to exist, some 
600 in number. The results are to be sent to a central 
committee, which is to sift and discuss and tabulate 
them, so as to establish families or types of text (if 
possible), and then select the MSS. of highest authority 
to serve as the foundation of a great critical edition. 

The exhibition of line book-bindings held at the Art 
Institute in Chicago, under the auspices of the Caxton 
Club, during the past month, proved a gratifying suc- 
cess. No such collection of books, so interesting and 
valuable aside from their artistic features, has ever been 
brought together in Chicago before, and it is doubtful 
if any other American city outside of New York could 
produce a similar exhibit, rich alike in associations and 
as specimens of the book-binder's art. 

" That, in the United States, the English language 
has, with the mass of the people, degenerated into a 
most disgraceful condition, and that it steadily becomes 
more and more depraved there, no intelligent observer 
can question," writes Dr. Fitzedward Hall iu a recent 
" Academy." Mr. Andrew Lang also discusses the sub- 
ject, contributing this note: "Speaking loosely, and 
subject to correction, I think that colloquial vulgarisms 
of a peculiar type began to appear in American litera- 
ture after I860. If America possessed an Academy 
it would probably have set its face against them." 

The trustees of the Crerar Library have recently 
taken a number of important steps towards the organi- 
zation of their work. In the resolution to live upon 
their income, and not to impair their capital even for 
the purpose of providing a building, they have carried 
out the suggestion recently made by us, as also in their 
early selection of a librarian. Mr. C. W. Andrews, of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has 
just been chosen for their executive head, is admirably 
qualified for the post offered him. It is also gratify- 
ing to learn that the choice of a librarian was deter- 
mined by no personal or local considerations, but by 
taking the best expert advice to be had. Of the reso- 
lution to make the library a collection of scientific lit- 
erature, we can only say that it does not seem to us the 
wisest of possible decisions, however great may be the 
usefulness of a scientific library, and however liberal 
the construction of the term. The claim of the human- 
ities is, on the whole, greater than the claim of science, 
particularly at a time when science gets so much more 
than its due share of the good things of life. But the 
decision is, we understand, irrevocably taken, and it is 
better than some plans that were reported to be under 
consideration.

HULL HOUSE MAPS AND 
PAPERS. 



A Presentation of Nationalities and Wages in a Con- 
gested District of Chicago, together with Comments 
and Essays on Problems Growing out of the Social 
Conditions. By Residents of Hull House, Chicago. 
One volume, X.+230 pp., with colored maps, diagrams, 
and 8 illustrations. 8vo, $2.50; special edition, with 
maps mounted on cloth, $3.50. 

This extraordinary book presents in graphic form a certain 
number of facts concerning the " criminal district of Chicago, 
which ranks as one of the most openly and flagrantly vicious 
in the civilized world," and also the poorest and most crowded 
section of Chicago. Especially amazing is the account of the 
sweating-shops. It would seem as if the direct menace which 
they offer to those who hold themselves aloof from the ques- 
tions of reform might awaken the public conscience to a most 
abrupt and sudden change. These maps speak for themselves, 
but the special essays, of which there are eleven, bring home 
the lessons in thunder-tones. An appendix, illustrated with 
photographic reproductions, gives a definite account of Hull 
House and its beneficent methods of work.

" Extremely bright and original. They are very clever papers. Mr. 
Harte writes wonderfully well, both forcibly and elegantly, is alive,

A Man Without a Memory,

HENRY SHELTON. Itimo, $1.00. 
Chiefly stories of the Civil War in

march, and conflict vividly rendered, 
but the stories are related in a spir- 
ited and felicitous style that makes 
them as noteworthy for their literary 
form as for their substance. 


Outre =Mer. 

Impressions of America. By PAUL BOURGET. Translated from the French.

M. Bourget's work is one of the most important ever written about the United 
States by a foreigner. He writes with impartiality, and naturally from the stand- 
point of a cultivated Frenchman and Academician, analyzing minutely the human 
documents that he everywhere finds, so that his observations upon New York, Chi- 
cago, Boston, our society, our manners, our industries in short, upon American phe- 
nomena generally are extremely suggestive and valuable, as well as entertaining.

History of the United States. 

By E. BENJAMIN ANDREWS, D.D., LL.D., President of Brown University. 
With Maps. 2 vols., crown 8vo, $4.00. 

Although published but a few weeks, President Andrews's history has already 
established itself as a standard work, filling a unique place among the histories of 
our country. The cordial indorsement it has received from the press, the immediate 
recognition of its merits by the public, and the approval and adoption of it by sev- 
eral leading educational institutions, confirm the publishers in their belief that the 
work satisfies the long-felt demand for a brief history that shall be both a genuine 
piece of literature, and a scholarly, reliable, and comprehensive narrative of our 
country's growth from the earliest times down to the present.

ical machinery.

8vo, gilt top, $1.75. 

Miss Scudder has made a thoughtful, philosophical, and 
eloquent study of the characteristics of the poetry of the

ing.

ond Edition. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

" Not only fills the promise that it should show woman's 
influence in forwarding and completing that great and haz- 
ardous political undertaking, but is a most entertaining pic- 
ture of society at the time on both sides of the Atlantic, and 
contains portraits of nearly all the prominent people of either 
sex in Old or New England, and a great display of the admir- 
able colonial architecture of the last century, private as well 
as public, in which the architects knew proper proportions and 
where to leave off as well as put on decorations." Brooklyn

By MARGARET C. GRAHAM. 16mo, $1.25.

The French Revolution 

Tested by Mirabeau's Career. 

Twelve Lectures on the History of the French Revolution, 

Delivered at the Lowell Institute, Boston, Mass. 

By Dr. Herman E. von Hoist. 

" In these two well-printed volumes Dr. von Hoist performs 
for students of the French Revolution a service similar in 
character to what he has already done for United States Con- 
stitutional History. This is his principal achievement in these 
lectures, that he has applied to Mirabeau's part in the early 
stages of the Revolution a more appreciative and really more 
competent critical study, based upon and enlightened by his 
fuller and better command of the principles and spirit of con- 
stitutional government. Dr. von Hoist thinks and writes on 
a basis of stanch Anglo-Saxon morality, which makes his book 
in many parts a vigorous and luminous object-lesson for the 
study of what is promising to become, if it has not already 
reached that eminence, the mystery of all abominable mys- 
teries, American politics and politicians." New York Inde-

EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 



The subject of educational values is by no 
means a new one, and the pedagogical litera- 
ture of all ages offers contributions to its dis- 
cussion. Yet in a certain sense this subject, 
implied as it is in all educational theory, has 
just now become a topic of the day, and is in 
a fair way to receive much new illustration and 
illumination. We may safely predict that for 
some years to come it will get unusual atten- 
tion at the hands of educators, and bear an em- 
phasis hitherto withheld yet preeminently de- 
served. Among the causes which just now are 
directing educational thought into this channel, 
two or three of the most important may be spe- 
cified. In the first place, the new psychology 
by which we mean the new impetus given to 
the pursuit of that science rather than any of 
the new methods or results so noisily heralded 
is being brought into more intimate relations 
than ever before with the art pedagogic. We 
are learning that knowledge of the human mind 
must underlie all good teaching, and that the 
faculties may be effectively played upon only 
by those who are familiar with their workings. 
Then we are on the eve of a reaction in favor 
of the humanities. The husks of science, even 
allowing for the solid kernel within, are found 
less satisfactory as a diet than they seemed a 
few years ago, and hungry souls in revolt 
against a regimen are everywhere calling for 
more generous and vitalizing forms of nutri- 
ment. This state of things naturally reopens 
the whole question of the relative values of sci- 
ence and literature, and the spokesmen of the 
former subject are discovering, somewhat to 
their surprise, that the champions of the latter 
are still undaunted. In fact, the contest be- 
tween the advocates of the narrowly practical 
and those who stand for the broader and more 
liberal type of education is being renewed all 
along the line, and philistinism trembles in the 
strongholds it once thought so secure. 

The very fact that educational values are 
being everywhere earnestly discussed is itself 
of the highest significance. The bread-and- 
butter policy of the " practical " people has al- 
ways scoffed at the notion that it was worth 
while to consider what education could do for 



230 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



the man himself, and has contented itself with 
asking what kind of a living it could give him. 
" Man shall not live by bread alone " was a 
text to which that policy never attached a se- 
rious meaning. But educational discussion 
could not, in the very nature of things, and 
even with so " practical " a people as ours, long 
remain upon so essentially irrational a plane. 
To accomplish results of a higher sort than 
those which are embodied in worldly success, 
the centre of attention must be the child himself 
rather than his material environment ; and the 
shifting of emphasis which corresponds to this 
more enlightened view is precisely the most 
hopeful feature of the phase of educational ac- 
tivity upon which we have now fairly entered. 

These conclusions as to the new trend of 
thought upon a subject of so great concern are 
substantiated by the discussion of the Corre- 
lation of Studies in Elementary Education 
which is the chief feature of the Report of the 
Committee of Fifteen. The sub-committee 
upon this subject was made up of five educa- 
tors of wide reputation, headed by Dr. William 
T. Harris. Their conclusions, as now presented, 
were not in all respects unanimously reached ; 
and to the main discussion, prepared by the 
chairman of the sub-committee, there are ap- 
pended as many dissenting opinions as there 
were other members. But these minority re- 
ports, taken all together, do not weaken more 
than ten per cent of the conclusions embraced 
in the very able document prepared by Dr. 
Harris, and represent no greater a divergence 
than was natural in view of the ground cov- 
ered and the complexity of the subject. 

We consider the document just referred to 
one of the most important contributions that 
have been made to recent discussion, and one 
that is sure to exert a wide and helpful influ- 
ence. Its defects are those of its qualities, or 
rather of those qualities developed in its au- 
thor's mind by the metaphysical training which 
has shaped his thought. The discussion is 
highly abstract, and at times a fictitious im- 
portance is given to commonplace ideas by their 
mere verbal garb. We hardly need to be told 
with so much ceremony, for example, that lan- 
guage is a valuable subject of study because 
" it enables each person to communicate his in- 
dividual experience to his fellows, and thus per- 
mits each to profit by the experience of all." 
Again, we may pardon, in view of the excellence 
of the principle, the form of the idea thus ex- 
pressed : " Only familiarity with fine English 
works will insure one a good and correct style." 



And we are, on the whole, rather grateful to 
Dr. Harris for his unexpectedly sparing use of 
that blessed word "apperception," and the other 
catch-words of metaphysical pedagogics. 

After a few preliminary remarks upon the 
condition of elementary studies, the report 
promptly reaches the question of educational val- 
ues, taking up successively the subjects of Lan- 
guage Studies, Arithmetic, Geography, His- 
tory, and Other Branches. Language is placed 
first, because it " rightfully forms the centre of 
instruction in the elementary school." The 
importance is emphasized of much reading of 
good pieces of literature, but we regret to see 
the " reader " spoken of so respectfully, and 
we more than doubt that " in almost all series 
of readers used in our elementary schools . . . 
the selections are literary works of art." The 
question of the relative values of the sesthetical 
and ethical elements in works of literary art 
is finely set forth in the following passage : 

" The ethical should, however, be kept in subordina- 
tion to the sesthetical, but for the sake of the supreme 
interests of the ethical itself. Otherwise the study of 
a work of art degenerates into a goody-goody perform- 
ance, and its effects on the child are to cause a reaction 
against the moral. The child protects his inner indi- 
viduality against effacement through external authority 
by taking an attitude of rebellion against stories with 
an appended moral. Herein the superiority of the ses- 
thetical in literary art is to be seen. For the ethical 
motive is concealed by the poet, and the hero is painted 
with all his brittle individualism and self-seeking. His 
passions and his selfishness, gilded by fine traits of 
bravery and noble manners, interest the youth, interest 
us all. The established social and moral order seems 
to the ambitious hero to be an obstacle to the unfolding 
of the charms of individuality. The deed of violence 
gets done, and the Nemesis is aroused. Now his deed 
comes back on the individual doer, and our sympathy 
turns against him and we rejoice in his fall. Thus the 
sesthetical unity contains within it the ethical unity. 
The lesson of the great poet or novelist is taken to heart, 
whereas the ethical announcement by itself might have 
failed, especially with the most self-active and aspiring 
of the pupils." 

This is all admirable, but the writer was not 
well-advised in bringing Aristotle's famous pas- 
sage about tragedy to his support. The Kaihar- 
sisfrage has developed many varieties of opin- 
ion, and this is one of the least justifiable. 

We have space for but few words upon the 
remaining sections of this discussion. An 
abridgment of arithmetic is recommended, with 
substitution of elementary algebra. Many pu- 
pils, it is justly said, are now kept back from 
the secondary stage of education " on the plea 
of lack of preparation in arithmetic, the real 
difficulty in many cases being a lack of ability 
to solve algebraic problems by an inferior

method." What is called " sailor geography " 
is unsparingly condemned. History "should 
be the special branch for education in the du- 
ties of citizenship." A " spiral course " in 
natural science should run from bottom to top 
of the curriculum. Formal English grammar 
should give way, in part, to a year or more of 
elementary Latin. The best thing that can pos- 
sibly be said about moral training is tersely put 
in these words: 

" The substantial moral training of the school is per- 
formed by the discipline rather than by the instruction 
in ethical theory. The child is trained to be regular 
and punctual, and to restrain his desire to talk and whis- 
per in these things gaining self-control day by day. 
The essence of moral behavior is self-control. The 
school teaches good behavior. The intercourse of a 
pupil with his fellows without evil words or violent ac- 
tions is insisted on and secured. The higher moral qual- 
ities of truth-telling and sincerity are taught in every 
class exercise that lays stress on accuracy of state- 
ment." 

The question of educational values exists, of 
course, along the whole line of educational 
work. But the controlling principles that must 
underlie its intelligent discussion are amply 
illustrated in the field of the elementary studies. 
That field, however, is no longer as sharply 
marked off as formerly from the outlying fields 
of secondary and collegiate work. The paper 
that we have just had under discussion exem- 
plifies the growing tendency to remove the tra- 
ditional metes and bounds that have hitherto 
defined the three stages of education. It oppor- 
tunely happens that an extension of the dis- 
cussion upon the plane of the higher stages is 
provided by the April number of the " Educa- 
tional Review," almost the entire contents of 
which are devoted to a series of papers, by com- 
petent writers, upon the special educational 
values of the subjects with which the higher in- 
struction is mainly concerned. These papers 
are of much interest, and, taken together with 
the Report of the Committee of Fifteen, afford 
a convenient starting-point for the further dis- 
cussion that is sure to be given to a subject so 
auspiciously broached and of so great an in- 
trinsic importance. 



THE fourth summer session of the School of Applied 
Ethics will be held at Plymouth this year as before, be- 
ginning July 8, and continuing for five weeks. There 
will be the usual three departments of ethics, economics, 
and the history of religions, and a new department de- 
voted to education. The latter department will be con- 
fined to the last two of the five weeks, so as not to 
conflict with the Denver meeting of the National Edu- 
cational Association. 



THE ALLOTROPY OF REALISM. 

No bandying of epithets will ever obliterate either 
of the "two eternal types of fiction." Whenever 
the realist or " veritist " fetches the other fellow a 
clip, like a Siamese twin he knocks himself down ; 
for romanticism, no less than realism, has a rational 
ground in human nature. Neither will ever have 
had its day or be outgrown. Whether the English 
romance dates back to De Foe's " Robinson Crusoe," 
or to Nash's " Jack Wilton," and whether English 
" realism " began with Richardson and Fielding, or 
with Sir Roger De Coveiiey, or (as Mr. Howells 
would have it) with Jane Austen, the fact remains 
that realism is as old as Homer and Job, and that 
" Romance " held its own, in Eden, with the poetry 
of the creation. Yet a decade ago, in this country, 
romanticists dismissed realism with disparaging 
gibes. And ever and anon realistic writers are 
heard berating romanticism, and actually predicting 
its downfall. "Except in the case of children," 
said a writer in the " Westminster Review," not 
long since, " fanciful narrative, whether founded on 
history or not, is repugnant to the spirit of the age. 
We want facts, not romantic dreams." One would 
suppose that the successes of Messrs. Stevenson, 
Kipling, Quiller-Couch, Doyle, Caine, Weyman, 
Hawkins, and Crawford would preclude the possi- 
bility of so one-sided a statement of what "we want," 
aside from the eternal principle of the thing. In a 
partisan opposition to romance there is no necessity 
either of underestimating its present vogue or of 
villifying it. When Professor Boyesen calls the ro- 
manticists "mere purveyors of entertainment," he 
is too plainly trifling : who was it said that pleasure, 
not edification, is the end of all art ? But when 
he gathers up his skirts and with a procul-este- 
profani air exclains, " I have never suspended my 
heroines over the brinks of yawning chasms ; nor 
have I introduced monkeys falling in love with men 
or men with monkeys ; nor am I equal to the de- 
picting of the perennial charms of women two thou- 
sand years old," we can only reply that this is really 
too bad. No wonder the professor finds romance 
" a great dead world, whose puppets are galvanized 
into a semblance of life by the art of the author." 
With Senor Vald^s, he would assert, apparently, 
that novelists " begin by deliberately falsifying 
human feelings." All of which may have been, in 
the childhood of the race ; and still may survive, 
in the " romance," say, of the Fijians, who, Mr. 
Basil Thomson informs us, " will tell of doings so 
strange that the jaws of the listeners fall apart." 

The energy consumed in the demolition of straw 
men, or in trying to prove that the days of realism 
or of romanticism are ended, might better be spent 
in the foredoomed attempt to determine who are 
realists and who are romanticists. A good many 
people would like to know, and withhold their al- 
legiance till the " doubtful states " shall be officially 
classed with one or the other " party." At present,

things are in an awful muss. Mr. Mabie, defining 
romance broadly as the " novel of plot, romance, in- 
cident, adventure," slyly includes in his camp all 
the uncertain ones Fielding, Thackeray, George 
Eliot, Mr. Meredith, Mr. Hardy, Mrs. Ward, Mr. 
Du Maurier. " No really great realistic novel has 
yet appeared in the English language " ! Professor 
Boyesen opens his " pantheon " of realists for 
Thackeray, George Eliot, Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Du 
Maurier. Mr. Howells excludes from his, Thack- 
eray, whom he dubs as most do Dickens a " car- 
icaturist." Balzac " at his best," according to Mr. 
Howells, is a realist; though he wrote, Mr. Lang 
claims, " in the spirit of romance and fantasy," and 
was considered an idealist by Stendhal in spite of 
the popular impression. Whether Mr. Alphonse 
Daudet is a realist or romanticist has not definitely 
been decided, even in France ; though he " drew 
from life" and was avowedly the "literary histori- 
ographer" of the Second Empire. Even Zola, ac- 
cording to one, excels "by his epic qualities," and 
to another is " colossally fantastic," not to say ro- 
mantic. At this point one is inclined to look well 
to his literary armor and make sure of the few re- 
maining screws. There are Le Sage, Scott, Dumas 
pere, Hugo; and there are Cervantes, Flaubert, 
Maupassant, Tourgue'neff, Tolstoi, Zola, Howells, 
and Miss Wilkins. 

Discouraging indeed to the mere student of text- 
books, this apparent confusion of terms seems to 
indicate that the word "realism" (whether or not 
with the approval of its chief promoters) is obtain- 
ing a wider and deeper meaning. Ten years ago, 
it meant that " a novel should have neither plot, 
nor beginning nor end." The realistic novel was 
then " the novel of the bare fact," photographic, 
rather than a portraiture, in the delineation of char- 
acter. This now should go, perhaps, by the name 
of naturalism. For realism is gaining a wider sig- 
nificance : "A realist," Professor Boyesen well 
says, " is a writer who adheres strictly to the logic 
of reality. . . who, to use Henry James's felicitous 
phrase, arouses not the pleasure of surprise, but 
that of recognition." 

For a lively, blinding statement of all the ele- 
ments of the problem, Mr. H. C. Bunner is respon- 
sible : " If I can write a story which will make you 
believe, while you are reading it, that when my 
hero was strolling down Fifth Avenue to attend a 
meeting of the Young Men's Kindergarten Club, he 
met a green dragon forty-seven feet long, with 
eighteen legs and three tails, and that the green 
dragon wept bitterly, and inquired the way to a 
cheese-shop, why, that's realism." 

We suspect that if terms were clearly defined, all 
argument would, as in matters political and religi- 
ous, be either needless or useless. But that can 
never be. At any rate, never could all agree as to 
the true scope of the imagination. Already some, 
with psychological perversity, assume that realism is 
the special product and prerogative of the observa- 
tion and the memory, and flourishes consequently 



only in eras when men are deficient in imaginative 
grasp; whereas idealism, so far from penetrating 
and illumining ordinary daily events, deals only 
with dazzling incidents and complicated plots. This, 
to one (whether writer or reader) who for the mo- 
ment notes his mental and visual processes, is man- 
ifestly absurd. A little bird's nest by William Hunt 
is an idealistic creation as truly as some picture of 
a battle, a coronation, or a martyrdom. Peter Bell 
inanely dallying with his " yellow primrose " is a 
hideous burlesque, not a type, of the true realist. 
Dr. Johnson's remark, " When you have seen one 
green field, you have seen all," can be accounted 
for only on a theory of mental deficiency. Imagi- 
nation, which has been variously defined as reason 
out for a holiday, or perception in a hurry, or mem- 
ory gone wild, or the dalliance of desire, whatever 

it be, is 

" the fountain light of all our day, 

a master light of all our seeing," 
and lends itself willingly, if mysteriously, to depict- 

" The green and scarlet of the Park, 
The undulating streets at dark, 
The brown smoke blown across the blue, 
This crowded city we walk through, 

The pallid faces full of pain, 
The field-smell of the passing wain, 
The laughter, longing, perfume, strife, 
The daily spectacle of life." 

Surely if, as Mr. Mabie asserts, " the aspirations, 
dreams, devotions, and sacrifices of men, are as real 
as their response to self-interest or their tendency 
to the conventional and the commonplace," the con- 
verse is equally true, that the objective play of per- 
ception and the selective observation involved in 
realism are as truly concerned with the imagina- 
tion as is the veriest romance. Coleridge's advice 
to poets is not without weight to the realist. '' A 
poet," he said, " ought not to pick nature's pocket. 
. . Trust more to your imagination than to your 
memory." Which does not mean, in the language 
of Sheridan, that he should " draw on his imagina- 
tion for his facts." Whenever Mr. Hall Caine shall 
give to the world his Life of Christ, to be written 
not from " the point of fact," but from " the point 
of imaginative insight," it will have a flourishing 
existence, as Kenan's did before it. Paradoxical as 
it may sound, it is the idealist who can most ade- 
quately cope with the real. A sketch of a few 
hasty lines by a true artist is more faithful than 
any photograph. Not literal truth, but " ideal 
truth," is still the end of literature.

THE AMERICAN AUTHORS' GUILD. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

" Every man a debtor to his profession " is the motto 
of the American Authors' Guild, which was organized in

one hundred professional writers. Its immediate ob-

jects are, in the first place, to advise and inform inex- 
perienced members in regard to royalties, copyright, cost 
of production, etc. ; to secure fair bargains between au- 
thor and publisher; to advocate and procure better laws 
affecting literary property; and, lastly, to promote such 
feelings of professional comradeship as have been fos- 
tered by similar societies in other callings. 

During the three years of its existence the Guild has 
made rapid progress in efficiency, and it exerts an influ- 
ence beyond its numerical strength. It has nearly 
trebled its membership ; it has no liabilities, and has a 
thousand dollars in its treasury. It has successfully 
mediated in all cases brought before it by members 
where disagreements had arisen with publishers, thereby 
averting ill-feeling and expensive legal measures. It 
has also, on behalf of its members, brought several pub- 
lishers to a just accounting. It intends to provide an 
auditor free of charge for members wishing to have 
their accounts with their publishers examined. It will 
also have at its service several attorneys skilled in copy- 
right law, to give free legal advice to members; and in 
cases where it may be necessary to go into court, to 
defend their claims for moderate fees. 

The Guild also purposes to establish in the near future 
a widows' and orphans' fund for the benefit of families 
of members left without means. 

To do all this it needs the active cooperation of the 
numerous literary workers who are not yet in its ranks. 
These should not be content to let the few fight their 
battles for them. Both honor and professional inter- 
est suggest that all writers, whether literary, scien- 
tific, or journalistic, should aid in the common cause. 
The dues are but three dollars a year, and by rigid 
economy (the officers giving their services without 
compensation) these dues have proved more than suf- 
ficient for immediate necessities. With a limited mem- 
bership the yearly income is small. Hence the useful- 
ness of the Guild is restricted. Only with a large mem- 
bership, such as is possessed by the English and French 
societies of a like character, can the Giiild advance its 
interests. We therefore suggest to professional writers 
the importance, both to themselves and to us, of affiliat- 
ing with the Guild. If any of these consider themselves 
independent of our aid, their profession has still a claim 
upon them. It is a recognized principle that the fortu- 
nate in any calling should give something of their means 
and experience in behalf of their young and untried 
brethren. The Guild, however, claims that all will ben- 
efit from its membership. Young writers will especially 
find it helpful. Some of our veteran writers have been 
glad to make use of its good offices. The society spares 
no effort to support in every honorable way the just 
claims of its members. 

The Secretary will, on request, furnish a copy of the 
Constitution and By-Laws, the roll of membership, etc., 
and any other information concerning the Guild which 
may be wanted. Any professional writer in good stand- 
ing, whether the author of a book or not, is eligible for mem- 
bership. JAMES GRANT WILSON, President.

A SUGGESTION ON TEACHING ENGLISH 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The usual order of progress in taking up English lit- 
erature in collegiate instruction is the time order from 



past to present. Where development is traced it is, per- 
haps invariably, from earlier writers to later. But this 
certainly contravenes, and that very directly, a most im- 
portant psychic and pedagogic law; namely, that mind 
tends ever to pass from known to unknown, from present 
to past, rather than vice versa. In any exploration of lit- 
erature it is most easy and profitable for the student to 
begin with the works of the day, as embodying thoughts 
and feelings familiar to him, and go out and upward 
from thence to the remote sources. If you live at the 
mouth of a stream, the natural method of tracing its 
course is to ascend it. 

Further, I would insist that the main divisions of lit- 
erary study should be not personal or periodic, but top- 
ical, because the largest and simplest interest runs in 
this form. For the college course, literature may be 
divided into fiction, drama, essays, and poetry. The 
best introduction to literary study is undoubtedly by- 
way of fjction; and the Freshman, beginning with cur- 
rent novels, should trace backward to the earliest prose 
romances. In the same way let the Sophomore take up 
the drama; the Junior, essays; the Senior, poetry. 
The student in four years might thus come to some large 
understanding of and real intimacy with the distinct 
qualities of the distinct forms of literary expression. 

And I would lay the greatest stress ou what is now 
almost neglected the study of current literature. But 
too often the graduate is led by his collegiate training 
to look slightingly on the art of his own times, in favor 
of the supposed classics, and even to sneer at the present 
under cover of the past. This is fatal to all productivity 
and usefulness in the present. Literature is at once the 
expression of life and the introduction thereto; and hence 
the art of every age has its main function for its own 
time. The main interest of the scholar naturally and 
rightly lies in the present; to get into true touch with 
his times, and so find his true place therein, is his most 
earnest endeavor; and so for him the study of the life 
of other ages should be wholly secondary and subsid- 
iary. Current history has recently become a study in 
some colleges, and I would enter this plea for current 
literature. HIRAM M. STANLEY.

GREEK DRAMA AT WASHBURN COLLEGE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The mention, in the last number of THE DIAL, of the 
production of Sophocles's " (Edipus Tyrannus " by the 
students of Beloit College suggests a deserved reference 
to a similar presentation by the students of Washburn 
College, Topeka, Kansas. 

The " Electra " of Sophocles was given, for the third 
time in this country, on the evenings of March 25 and 
26. The final presentation was an outgrowth from the 
prescribed course in the study of dramatic Greek litera- 
ture through translations. Some months have been 
spent in the perfecting of the play. The cast of char- 
acters was well adapted to individual powers. The 
highly emotional requirements for the central figure, 
" Electra," were well sustained. The scenery and cos- 
tumes made for this production followed the ancient 
style as faithfully as possible. Plumtre's translation 
into English was used. A chorus below the stage ren- 
dered the music composed for the play by Dr. Arthur 
E. Dyer of Cambridge, England.

THE COMMONWEALTH AND PRO- 
TECTORATE.* 



The period of the Commonwealth and the 
Protectorate must always remain of deep inter- 
est to the English or American student. It is 
not simply that men are prone to worship the 
rising rather than the setting sun, for Crom- 
well is certainly a far more interesting figure 
than Charles I., but that much of England's 
subsequent greatness, as well as our own first 
lessons in political liberty, date from the period 
when the great Protector was at the height 
of his power. It is undoubtedly due to the 
happy fact that his theme is thus cumulative, 
that the interest in Mr. Gardiner's work has 
now been sustained through a series of fifteen 
formidable volumes. The theme of this new 
volume is the beginning of the heroic struggle 
of republican England, for the maintenance of 
the right to control and direct her own affairs 
a right which she had gained in the overthrow 
of Charles I. The most fanatical of modern 
Tories must kindle at the recital of the deeds of 
valor of the brave men who fought under Crom- 
well or Blake. The most ardent supporter of 
royal prerogative must admire the sturdy valor 
of the little Commonwealth, as, beset by bitter 
foes at home, without a really staunch friend 
in all the courts of Europe, she slowly shakes 
herself loose from her numerous enemies and 
emerges at last, triumphant, the one great 
redeeming fact of a century otherwise bloody 
enough, and false enough as God only knows, 
" the mighty and puissant nation rousing it- 
self like a strong man from sleep." The threat- 
ened invasion from Ireland, the actual invasion 
from Scotland, united the factions and consoli- 
dated the strength of the Commonwealth, until 
even the pronounced royalists, who regarded 
the regicide government with horror, refused to 
support a king who came to them sustained by 
foreign troops and pledged to foist upon the 
country an ecclesiastical system which English- 
men for the most part detested. It was the Irish 
and Romanism that ruined the cause of Charles 
II. in Ireland. It was the Scotch and the Kirk 
that defeated him at Worcester. It was decided 
once and for all time that England " should 
not be ruled by a King who came in as an in- 
vader. When Charles I. was sent to the block,

1649-1660. By S. R. Gardiner. Volume I., 1649-1651. New

Cromwell had but the support of the army and 
of a handful of enthusiasts ; when he shattered 
the Scottish army at Worcester he had on his 
side the national spirit of England. . . . En- 
gland had shown herself strong enough to frus- 
trate the attempts of Ireland and Scotland, to 
dictate the terms on which her internal govern- 
ment was to be carried on" (page 446). 

The plot of the book is as simple as that of 
the ordinary fashionable novel. The Common- 
wealth and not the great Oliver is the central 
figure. About this theme, as a skilful artist, 
the author gathers his material. Yet Cromwell, 
the Hamlet of the piece, is by no means left 
out. At first his part is almost subordinate ; 
and yet with each shifting of the play the con- 
viction grows upon the reader, as it once grew 
upon the Englishmen of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, that only Cromwell can save the Common- 
wealth, and he passes to the foreground as the 
one prominent figure of the play. This we feel 
in history ; this is the true Cromwell, not a 
dehumanized, colorless adventurer, like the Na- 
poleon of Sloan, but a very human sort of man, 
a thoroughgoing opportunist who thrusts him- 
self forward into greatness not from mere sel- 
fish ambition, but because he and the friends 
of the Commonwealth see in him the only sal- 
vation of England. 

In the " Commonwealth " Mr. Gardiner 
reveals the same characteristic elements of 
strength and weakness as in his earlier works. 
In style, however, there is a marked improve- 
ment. Occasionally the old, involved, heavy 
laden sentence that reminds us of one of Crom- 
well's paragraphs, lumbers across the page. 
Yet such sentences are now comparatively rare. 
There is an evident effort on the author's part 
to secure clearness even at the expense of 
printer's ink. To this end the numerous and 
carefully prepared maps contribute no small 
part. In all that constitutes the drudgery of 
historical writing, the careful and painstaking 
search after material, Mr. Gardiner may have 
many rivals ; but in the management of his ma- 
terial he is unsurpassed, even by Mr. Freeman. 
He certainly far excels Stubbs. 

If Mr. Gardiner has a weakness as a histo- 
rian it lies in a certain largeness of heart. He 
is loth to think altogether ill of anybody. 
Clowns are many upon his pages, but real down- 
right villains are scarce, which is perhaps, 
after all, truer to life. Few men, especially 
few great men, the kind that figure in history, 
are consciously and hopelessly bad. Even the 
faithless Charles, the man incapable of devo-

tion to anything, not even to himself, the man 
without principle, without even dignity, upon 
whose conscience the obligations of friendship 
sat as lightly as the most sacred oath, in his 
wandering after Worcester, under the skilful 
pen of Mr. Gardiner, becomes almost a hero. 

In his account of Cromwell's Irish campaign, 
Mr. Gardiner, like many a more pronounced 
admirer of Cromwell, is compelled to face the 
massacres of Drogheda and Wexford. For 
Cromwell, like the Frankish Charles or the 
French Napoleon, has left behind him the mem- 
ory of cold-blooded massacre as an ugly blot 
upon his fair name which it has puzzled his 
admirers to explain away. But the " damned 
spot " will not " out." Nor are Mr. Gardiner's 
efforts, not at justification, to be sure, but ex- 
tenuation, more satisfactory. 

Inchiquin, in his dispatch to Ormund of Sep- 
tember 15, says : 

" Many men and some officers have made their es- 
capes out of Drogheda. ... All conclude that no man 
[had] quarter with Cromwell's leave; that yet many 
were saved by officers and soldiers; that the Governor 
was killed in the Mill Mount after quarter [had been] 
given by the officer that came first there; that some of 
the towers were defended until yesterday, quarter being 
denied them; and that yesterday morning the towers 
wherein they were, were blown up; that Verney, Fin- 
glas, Warner, and some other officers were alive in the 
hands of some of Cromwell's officers twenty-four hours 
after the business was done, but whether their lives 
were obtained at Cromwell's hands, or that they are yet 
living, they cannot tell." (Inchiquin to Ormund, Sept. 
15. Gilbert's Const, Hist., Vol. II., Pref. XXVIII.) 

Of the officers mentioned by Inchiquin, we 
know that Verney was murdered almost in the 
very presence of Cromwell (Lady Verney's 
Verney Family, II., p. 344) and that Boyle 
was summoned from dinner by a soldier and 
shot as he left the room (76ic?). Of Finglas 
and " Warner " (Warren) no particulars of the 
deaths are known, but inasmuch as Cromwell 
had especially ordered that the officers be 
" knocked in the head " (Cromwell to Fenthal, 
Sept. 17, Carlyle Letter, C. V.), there can be 
little doubt that they too were murdered in the 
same cold-blooded manner. 

Now it may be that " Cromwell's rages were 
never premeditated," and that " it always re- 
quired some touch of concrete fact to arouse 
the slumbering wrath which lay coiling about 
his heart" (" The Commonwealth," Vol. I., pp. 
131-132) ; it may be that " in the heat of ac- 
tion there stood out in his mind, through the 
blood-red haze of war, thoughts of vengeance 
to be taken for the Ulster massacre " (p. 133), 
and that " the stern command to put all to the 



sword who ' were in arms in the town,' leapt 
lightly from his lips " (76iVZ) ; the grim fact 
yet remains that twenty-four hours after the 
city had been taken, and possibly longer, the 
hideous work went on, and that when Crom- 
well's officers, and even his common soldiers, 
had spared many of their helpless enemies, they 
yet cut them down in cold blood in obedience to 
the order of Cromwell. This was certainly not 
the result of furious rage, still less did it arise 
from a purpose on Cromwell's part to take ad- 
vantage of the laws of war (p. 132), as Tilly 
had taught them on the continent. Even by 
that law, prisoners once received to quarter 
were to be spared. At Limerick, Ireton cash- 
iered an officer who killed prisoners that a sub- 
ordinate had spared. Cromwell himself, in his 
wars on the other side of the Irish sea, followed 
a very different course, and was uniformly mer- 
ciful. At Worcester he even imperilled his 
own life in order to save his foes (p. 444). 

Now Mr. Gardiner possibly knows what was 
going on in Cromwell's mind, when, upon the 
third attempt, he saw his soldiers at last carry 
the wall of Drogheda and pour into the city ; 
but all connected with this dark affair, the use 
which Cromwell made subsequently of the ter- 
ror which the massacre had inspired among the 
simple-minded Irishry, the all but exact repe- 
tition of the same scenes at Wexford, a few 
weeks later, indicate a determined purpose on 
Cromwell's part to adopt this severity in or- 
der to gain a definite object. We may judge 
the man, but we have no right to take him out 
of the age in which he acted the age of the 
religious wars that had followed the Reforma- 
tion. So far, the civil wars in England had 
been political. Religious elements, even social 
elements, were not altogether absent, and from 
time to time they had added to the bitterness of 
the conflict. But when the war crossed to Ire- 
land it was no longer Puritan against Cavalier, 
but Protestant against Catholic ; worse, it was 
the seventeenth century Englishman against 
the seventeenth century Irishman. Ever since 
the'days of Strafford, the English had regarded 
the possibility of an Irish invasion with some 
such feeling of dread and latent panic as a 
slave-holding aristocracy might regard the pos- 
sible terrors of an uprising of their serfs. The 
English despised the Irish, at the same time that 
they feared them. The terrors, the possibility 
of horrors indescribable, which must attend 
such an inroad nerved the hands and steeled 
the hearts of the Englishmen who followed 
Cromwell across the Irish Sea. They went in

of Charles now made imminent. Cromwell, 
while he was certainly above the blind fero- 
cious instincts of the common soldier, yet saw 
in the imminence of the peril and the appall- 
ing nature of the danger a demand for the ut- 
most severity. The danger must not be trifled 
with. He must strike hard. He must strike to 
crush. 

Mr. Gardiner thinks that the letter to the 
Royalist governor of Dundalk, written while 
the massacre at Drogheda was still in progress, 
indicates an uneasy conscience on the part of 
Cromwell and is an attempt on his part at self- 
justification. But such men as Cromwell are 
not wont to justify themselves before an enemy, 
especially when they summon him to lay down 
his arms. The letter really throws a deal of 
light upon the purpose which Cromwell had in 
mind in ordering the slaughter, in showing the 
use which he made of it at once. " I offered 
mercy to the garrison of Drogheda," he writes, 
" in sending the Governor a summons before I 
attempted the taking of it, which being refused 
brought this evil upon them. If you, being 
warned thereby, shall surrender your garrison 
to the use of the Parliament of England, . . . 
you may thereby prevent effusion of blood. If 
upon refusing this offer, that which you like 
not, befalls you, you will know whom to blame." 
(Carlyle, Letter CHI.). This is not a justifi- 
cation. It is a simple threat, in Cromwell's cool 
way, to treat the garrison of Dundalk as he 
had treated the garrison of Drogheda. Simi- 
lar terms were sent to other garrisons about 
him. If they dared to defend themselves, they 
must expect the terms of Drogheda. Crom- 
well proposed by the terror inspired by the first 
blow which he struck to intimidate the half- 
armed and poorly-disciplined Irish. Nor was 
he altogether unsuccessful. Wexford, in the 
south, dared to stand to the issue of arms, and 
her fate was that of Drogheda. But other 
towns were wiser and yielded. The terror of 
Drogheda fell upon the simple-hearted folk, 
and their officers could not drive them to face 
the bloody issue. That is, Cromwell coolly 
adopted and carried out a plan of repression 
and cruelty that resembles the cold-blooded 
measures adopted by Charles the Great in re- 
ducing the pagan Saxons. That Cromwell did 
not go as far as Charles, was not because he 
was unequal to such a task, but because the 
Irish were in no condition to make the desper- 
ate resistance with which the Saxons so long 



defied Charles. That Mr. Gardiner himself 
inclines, after all, to this view may be inferred 
from a passage on page 470, in which he con- 
demns Monk's massacre at Dunbar. Here, 
undoubtedly alluding to Drogheda, he says : 
" With all Scotland at his [Monk's] feet, no 
cruelty was needed to terrify other garrisons 
into submission." 

Cromwell belongs to the seventeenth century. 
In the nineteenth century, with such shadows 
as Drogheda and Wexford in the background, 
his religiousness becomes despicable cant. He 
is a compound of Pecksniff and John Girdle- 
stone. The one he surpasses in meanness and 
the other in cold-blooded villainy. But Crom- 
well does not belong to the nineteenth century. 
He belongs to the seventeenth. The treaty of 
Westphalia was scarcely a year old when his 
ferocious soldiers were roasting Irishmen in the 
towers of Drogheda or knocking priests on the 
head at Wexford. Cromwell was a saint of the 
Old Testament rather than of the New. The 
religious books that the good Ulphilas had once 
thought too exhilarating for his half-trained 
Gothic Christians were altogether the favorite 
reading of Cromwell and the stern-browed men 
who followed him. Their political creed was a 
short one. The pious were to rule the state. 
Those who resisted were to be as Agag before 
Samuel, or as the Canaanite before Israel. The 
symbol of the Commonwealth was the sword of 
Joshua rather than the staff of John. The vio- 
lent contrast between the pious ejaculations 
ever upon the lips of Cromwell, and his fero- 
cious cruelty, do not prove him to have been 
either a hypocrite or a madman, any more than 
in the case of Joshua or Samuel.

THE DTTSK OF THE NATIONS.* 

Some readers of THE DIAL may remember 
" The Great Cryptogram " which purported to 
show that a large part of Elizabethan literature 
was the work of Bacon. A certain young man, 
desirous of keeping up with Shakespearian crit- 
icism, felt very heavy-hearted at having to read 
so big a book with prospect of so small a gain. 
Opening it at random, he fortunately hit upon 
page 973, where he found cited toward estab- 
lishing the view that Bacon wrote " The Anat- 
omy of Melancholy," four passages from

Satisfied as to the scientific character of the 
work, the young man closed the book with a 
mind greatly relieved. 

If some such reader should chance to open 
Herr Max Nordau's work on " Degeneration " 
at page 319, he might get somewhat the same 
impression. That page presents Mr. Oscar 
Wilde still clad in the doublet and kneebreeches 
of fifteen years ago, with the same old sunflower 
(not even a green carnation), having in his 
mouth the paradoxes of " Intentions," taken se- 
riously, set up as an a3sthetic Aunt Sally, to be 
promptly knocked down again by Herr Max 
Nordau with such hard words as " egomaniac," 
and "hysterical." The impression, however, 
would be a mistake: although it may seem 
wholly absurd to those who have seen only the 
extracts in the Sunday papers, I cannot agree 
with those who hold the book to be nothing more 
than clap- trap and sensationalism. 

The subject is in itself a sort of challenge to 
serious thought. The thesis is that the upper 
classes of the chief races of Europe to-day, hav- 
ing passed suddenly into wholly new conditions, 
wearied by the complication and rapidity of 
modern life, by its immensely enlarged range 
of interest, insufficiently nourished, and pois- 
oned by large cities and over-use of narcotics 
and stimulants, are falling into fatigue and ex- 
haustion, breaking down into prematureold age. 
Among the results of this state of hysteria and 
nervous prostration on a large scale, and one of 
the most marked signs of it, appear all manner 
of perverted eccentricities in the world of art. 
But the promulgators of such perversions, 
though hailed by the vulgar as heralds of a new 
era, are in reality but the most enfeebled and 
degraded of humanity : in other words, to use 
the scientific term, degenerates. If such be a 
fair picture of our time, the investigation of the 
literature of the present day from such a stand- 
point is a matter of interest. 

The question is one which would seem not 
wholly outside the possibilities of scientific in- 
quiry. Criminal anthropology is a young 
science as yet ; it is not absolutely sure of its 
ground ; but a competent scholar could cer- 
tainly find opportunity here for sound and val- 
uable work. It is rather unfortunate that it 



was impossible (page 17) for Herr Nordau to 
study the physical peculiarities of his subjects 
and their ancestry as well, for these points are 
usually regarded by anthropologists as of more 
importance in the study of degenerates than 
such psychic phenomena as can be observed. 
These latter peculiarities are sometimes met 
with in normal subjects : the physical and he- 
reditary conditions are generally regarded as 
surest evidence. But on the more confined 
and slightly treacherous ground one may make 
up for deficiencies by greater care as to the ac- 
cwacy of observation, the correctness of gen- 
eralization, and the exactitude of inference. 
The argument is one by analogy. There have 
been observed certain cases with such and such 
ancestral conditions, such and such physical 
conditions, and such and such mental peculiar- 
ities. Persons agreeing in such characteristics 
are known as "degenerates." Now on exam- 
ining the works of various contemporary men 
of letters Herr Nordau observes certain mental 
peculiarities, to which he adds occasionally cer- 
tain physical traits. He infers that these au- 
thors belong properly to the class in question 
and should be regarded as morally insane. 
When Heine prayed to be saved from the evil 
one and a metaphor, he was thinking of the 
argument by analogy ; but it hardly seems nec- 
essary to go to this length. We must, of course, 
recognize its necessary weaknesses, but we may 
easily ascribe to it such importance as it de- 
serves. 

The matter is, however, one which cannot 
be presented in popular form save by a master 
of modern anthropology, of alienism, and of 
literary criticism. The subject is a delicate 
one; * it lends itself too readily to exaggeration, 
to sensationalism, even to prejudice, for it to 
be a fit task for anyone but a sound and tem- 
perate scientist. For the authorities upon such 
a subject are not such as the public can readily 
consult or appreciate ; nor is the general reader 
able to weigh the evidence properly, nor to de- 
tect fallacies readily ; he must in a measure 
rely upon his author, he must, in fact, trust 
his statements implicitly. It is unfortunate, 
therefore, that the idea should have got about 
that Herr Nordau is anything but a skilful 
scientist, that his methods are not the most 
exact, that his logic is not the most rigid, that 
he is not devoted to the attainment of Truth 

* In more senses than one. It ought to be said that no good 
woman I unless perhaps one who has already studied kindred 
matters) will read it without coming across much that is ex- 
tremely shocking to her.

at any cost. If he were not such a scholar, his 
book should never have been published for 
popular reading by any reputable house. 

Herr Nordau is undoubtedly a scientist. It 
is true that we need hardly concede him the 
title because he has a great number of exact 
references in footnotes,* nor because he deals 
largely with technical terms, nor even because 
he has no admiration for religion. But then 
we need not deny it to him because he is the 
author of " Die Conventionellen Liigen der 
Kulturmenschheit." That book was certainly 
extravagant and journalistic ; but it had con- 
siderable popularity, and was republished in 
America. Nor is it proper to refuse attention 
to a man because he believes Professor Lom- 
broso to be u one of the loftiest mental phe- 
nomena of the century," even if we ourselves 
believe Lombroso to be often over-enthusiastic. 

As to whether Herr Nordau be a scientist 
of eminently sound and well-balanced temper- 
ament, there is, unfortunately, more room for 
doubt. He himself seems to affirm that he is. 
He says (page 507) that except perhaps in his 
treatment of the " Young German " movement, 
he has observed any given phenomena with the 
cool equanimity of scientific method. There 
is, however, something about his language 
which rouses an uncomfortable idea that we 
have to do with a writer of rather a different 
character. But there are, I think, no passages 
in the whole book more excessive than these : 

" True, science tells us nothing about the life after 
death, of harp-concerts in Paradise, and of the trans- 
formation of stupid youths and hysterical geese into 
white-clad angels with rainbow-colored wings " (p. 109). 

" George Brandes, a sponger on the fame or name 
of others, has throughout his life followed the calling 
of a ' human orchestra,' who with head, mouth, hands, 
elbows, knees, and feet, plays ten noisy instruments at 
once, dancing before poets and authors, and, after the 
hubbub, passes his hat round among the deafened pub- 
lic " (p. 356). 

" A poor degenerate devil who scribbles such stuff, 
and an imbecile reader who follows his twaddle like 
passing clouds, are simply to be pitied " (p. 137). 

" Another graphomaniac, the author of that imbecile 
book, Rembrandt as Educator, drivels in almost the 
same way" (p. 106). 

" The creatures moving on his stage are not thinking 
and speaking human beings, but tadpoles or slugs, con- 
siderably more stupid than trained fleas at a fair " (p. 
238). 

"... Walt Whitman, who is likewise one of the 
deities to whom the degenerate and hysterical of both 
hemispheres have for some time been raising altars " 
(p. 230). 

*He understands the value of footnotes. "The English- 
man accepts a fit of delirium if it appears with footnotes" 

(p. 78). 



Of a book like this, we may rightly expect 
that not only in scientific temper will the author 
be above reproach, but in his literary criticism 
as well. Here I must allow that Herr Nordau 
sometimes leaves a little to be desired. It may 
be too much to expect of a scientist that he 
should trouble himself with an author's own 
standpoint. And of course, when a man is criti- 
cizing the literature of all Europe, one can 
hardly expect him not to slip up now and then. 
Still, I could wish he had not seemed to think 
that Ibsen's characters always express Ibsen's 
own sentiments (pp. 338-415 passim; but cf. 
also pp. 342, 343) ; or that Tolstoi created the 
murderer Pozdnyscheff in the " Kreutzer Son- 
ata " as a mouthpiece for his own views (p. 161). 
It seems hardly to show keen discrimination to 
recognize in Walt Whitman's use of anaphora 
the parallelism of the Psalms (p. 232) ; or to 
believe that Rossetti's refrains " possess the 
character of an obsession " (p. 92), any more 
than the refrains of the old ballads from which 
they were imitated. As for errors, there will 
probably be found few worse than the state- 
ment that " In the year 1843 . . . Ruskin 
began to publish the feverish studies on art 
which were subsequently collected under the 
title of 'Modern Painters.' He was then a young 
divinity student," etc.,* (p. 78); or that "In 
1887 his [Tolstoi's] 'Kreutzer Sonata' ap- 
peared, and was the first of his works to carry 
his name to the borders of civilization " (p. 
148) ; or that Walt Whitman " for his fame 
has to thank just those bestially sensual pieces, 
which first drew to him the attention of all the 
pruriency of America " (p. 231). 

With such characteristics as a scientist and 
a critic, will anyone doubt that Herr Nordau is 
fully capable of treating a most difficult and 
delicate subject in such a manner as will really 
instruct and assist the general reader, for 
whom his book seems particularly designed ? I 
suppose some people may have such doubts. 
He, himself, I believe, has none. He under- 
stands that his work will lay him open to mis- 
conception, but he goes on resolutely. " The 
danger, however, to which he exposes himself 
cannot deter a man from doing that which he 
regards as his duty. When a scientific truth 
has been discovered, he owes it to humanity, 
and has no right to withhold it " (p. ix). 
True, doubtless ; although there would seem to 
be no especial need of dressing up the scientific 
truth as though it were a bit of popular expo- 
sition. 

* Perhaps this last is due to the translator.

For my part, I also have little doubt in the 
matter. Although, as I have said, the book is 
by no means "nothing more than clap-trap and 
sensationalism," there is a very fair proportion 
of those two undesirable qualities. And this is 
rather a pity, for there is also much of interest. 
Herr Nordau is undoubtedly a student of broad 
reading in the literature of the subject, a man 
capable of immense intellectual work. He pos- 
sesses great power of presentation, a keen eye 
for the follies of others, some sound views on 
art,* and a hearty admiration for sane and solid 
thought. But he has too much of a steeple- 
chaser in him ; he gets on his gaudy racing col- 
ors, sees his goal miles away, and then no ob- 
stacle will keep him from it. 

So much on Herr Nordau himself. From the 
responsibility of discussing the thesis of his 
book, I must, as gracefully as may be, retire. 
There are many things that might be said for 
some of his views and against others. But the 
opinions of such an author cannot claim serious 
discussion except it be in the technical journals. 
" The verbose rhetorician," remarks Herr Nor- 
dau (p. Viii.) "exposes with more or less grace 
or cleverness the subjective impressions received 
from the works he criticises, but is incapable of 
judging if those works are the productions of a 
shattered brain, and also the nature of the men- 
tal disturbance expressing itself by them." The 
most fruitful review of Herr Nordau's book 
would be by a specialist in brain-diseases.

CHICAGO'S OTHER 



What Mr. Charles Booth's " Labor and Life 
of the People " is to London, the book entitled 
" Hull-House Maps and Papers " is to a portion 
of Chicago. Both works are made up of con- 
tributions from a number of investigators, each 
having a thorough special knowledge of the 
subject treated. But the colored maps accom- 
panying the Hull-House book cover a field much 
smaller than the whole of London, and it has 
therefore been possible to make them much 
more exact and minute than the London maps. 
Instead of showing the general character of 
whole streets at a glance, they give the nation- 
alities and economic condition of the inhab-

itants of each dwelling separately, even the 
house numbers being given. They are thus 
made valuable for purposes requiring exact 
knowledge. 

The section chosen for this graphic treat- 
ment lies just east and southeast of Hull-House, 
extending from Halsted street east one mile to 
State street, and from Polk street south one- 
third of a mile to Twelfth street. This third 
of a square mile includes not only the poorest 
and most crowded part of Chicago, but also, 
east of the river, a part of one of the most 
openly vicious and criminal districts of the civ- 
ilized world. An adjacent section of this same 
criminal district was placed under the micro- 
scope by Mr. Stead in his work of a year ago. 

The data from which the maps were con- 
structed were secured in the course of a gov- 
ernmental investigation of the slums of great 
cities, undertaken in the spring of 1893 by the 
United States Department of Labor. Mrs. 
Florence Kelley, of Hull-House, was the special 
agent expert in charge of this work in Chicago ; 
and as the schedules were returned to her daily 
by her four assistants, the data required for 
these maps were taken off by a resident of 
Hull-House. In one map the nationalities of 
the people are shown, and a second map shows 
the average weekly income of the families on 
each lot. In showing the economic condition, 
the colors adopted in Mr. Booth's maps are re- 
tained as far as possible ; but while the London 
maps include all classes of society, these repre- 
sent only the poorest part of Chicago, where 
those families which have more than twenty 
dollars a week are the aristocracy. The pre- 
dominant color on the wage-map is blue, repre- 
senting wages of from five to ten dollars a week 
for an entire family. 

The neighborhood is distinctly cosmopolitan. 
Altogether eighteen nationalities are distin- 
guished on the map, although the English, En- 
glish-Canadians, Scotch, and Americans are 
counted as one nationality, designated by white. 
Even so, the white spots on the map would be 
few and small were it not for the many Amer- 
ican-born children, who are often virtually as 
alien as their parents, but who are counted as 
Americans if they are more than ten years of 
age, or if they attend a public school. The map 
shows a preponderence of Italians, Russian and 
Polish Jews, and Bohemians ; but we are told 
in the explanatory text that the Irish control 
the polls. In some cases as many as ten na- 
tionalities are represented in a single building, 
but usually neither Italians nor Jews are found

in the same tenement-house with other nation- 
alities ; for, as by a sort of Gresham's law of 
demography, the appearance of the " Dago " 
or the " Sheeny " drives out all other tenants. 
Race prejudice and class distinctions are as 
prevalent here as among the brown-stone fronts 
of Michigan Avenue. The shop fronts on the 
principal streets keep up an appearance of re- 
spectability, so that the casual passer-by gets 
no idea of the poverty and squalor just beyond. 
" Rear tenements and alleys form the core of the dis- 
trict, and it is there that the densest crowds of the most 
wretched and destitute congregate. Little idea can be 
given of the filthy and rotten tenements, the dingy 
courts and tumble-down sheds, the foul stables and di- 
lapidated out-houses, the broken sewer-pipes, the piles 
of garbage fairly alive with diseased odors, and of the 
numbers of small children filling every nook, working 
and playing in every room, eating and sleeping in every 
window-sill, pouring in and out of every door, and seem- 
ing literally to pave every scrap of 'yard.' " 

Some twenty pages of " Map Notes and Com- 
ments," written by Miss Agnes Sinclair Hoi- 
brook, are followed by papers on " The Sweat- 
ing System " by Mrs. Florence Kelley, State 
Inspector of Factories and Workshops, and 
" Wage-earning Children " by Mrs. Kelley 
and Mrs. A. P. Stevens, the Assistant Inspec- 
tor. In these two papers are related some of 
the worst abuses of Chicago's industrial life. 
Here we are told that fashionable wraps and 
the best grades of custom-made clothing, as 
well as ready-made suits and white underwear, 
are made in sweat-shops, often in alarming 
proximity to contagious disease. There are 
only two garment-manufacturers in Chicago 
who do not give out clothing to be made or 
finished in tenement-houses. We read that in 
each large clothing shop there is an examiner, 
who combines with the function of passing upon 
the work that conies from the sweat-shops that 
of destroying such vermin as his rapid exami- 
nation of the clothing happens to disclose. Af- 
ter reading of the filthy surroundings among 
which even expensive clothing is made, and of 
the deadly disease- germs and loathsome insects 
which frequently inhabit it, the abolition of the 
sweating-system becomes not a matter of be- 
nevolence only, but of self-interest as well, to 
every member of the community. Altruism 
and enlightened selfishness both lead inevitably 
to Mrs. Kelley's conclusion, that the abolition 
of tenement-house manufacture is the only ade- 
quate remedy for the existing evils. 

In the article on "Wage-earning Children," it 
is clearly shown that we are far behind England 
in requiring precautions for the health and 



safety of working-children. This chapter is a 
pitiful picture of little children exposed by the 
conditions of their work to vice, disease, and 
mutilation ; of dissolute adult employees sow- 
ing moral pestilence among children and young 
girls ; of boys killed and maimed by machinery 
without the simplest safety appliances ; of con- 
tracts with parents releasing the employer from 
liability in case of accidents ; of employers 
growing rich on the labor of droves of children, 
whose wages range from forty cents to four 
dollars a week ; and of men actually superan- 
nuated at forty, or even at thirty -four, by work 
begun too early in childhood, and so becoming 
a burden upon their own children, or upon the 
county. Thus child -labor perpetuates itself. 
A record of physical examinations, with accom- 
panying charts constructed by Dr. Bayard 
Holmes, shows a startling prevalence of dis- 
ease and deformity among factory children. As 
the solution of the child-labor problem the writ- 
ers of the paper propose compulsory school at- 
tendance up to the age of sixteen. 

" Where they are the wage-earning children are an 
unmitigated injury to themselves, to the community 
upon which they will later be burdens, and to the trade 
which they demoralize. They learn nothing valuable ; 
they shorten the average of the trade life, and they lower 
the standard of living of the adults with whom they 
compete." 

There is much in these papers to confirm one 
in the principles for which Hull-House stands, 
that the poor need not charity, but justice. 
Here one finds repeated references to merchant- 
prince philanthropists who first make their 
money by extortion and oppression, and then 
give back some part of it to the working peo- 
ple in charity. The value of labor organization 
is shown by the fact that the unorganized and 
poorly organized trades are just the ones in 
which the workers receive the least pay for the 
most work, and seem compelled to set their 
children at work while they are still babies. 

The papers which make up the remainder of 
the book are for the most part of a more spe- 
cial nature. They are : " Receipts and Expen- 
ditures of Cloak-makers in Chicago," by Miss 
Isabel Eaton ; " The Chicago Ghetto " (a de- 
scription of the Jewish quarter), by Mr. Charles 
Zeublin ; " The Bohemian People in Chicago,"

STUDIES OF NEW JAPAN.* 



Mr. Laf cadio Hearn, who was for many years 
a teacher of English in various gymnasia of 
Japan, presents us, in his volume entitled " Out 
of the East," with eleven studies on New Japan, 
distinguished, as was the author's recent 
" Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan," by strong 
sympathy with both the extant religions of Ja- 
pan Shinto and Buddhism. 'T is true, 't is 
pity, that this rare and valuable sympathy is 
often allowed to degenerate into distinctly doc- 
trinaire handling of data, as anyone familiar 
with the darker side of Japan will easily see. 
However, let us be thankful, for just at present 
something of this kind may prove wholesome 
equally for American national and religious 
conceit, both of which have been so long nur- 
tured by graphic accounts of " effete monarch- 
ies" and " degraded heathen," which, unless 
much be soon done to check them, may end by 
calling Oriental reformers and missionaries 
here! Viewed thus as advocacy, and not as 
scientific, impartial estimate, these essays must 
be highly commended, especially to those re- 
pelled by this description ; for such repulsion 
reveals just that mental condition the book was 
written and is calculated to meet. 

The eleven essays are so varied in both style 
and substance that they can be characterized 
only in turn. The first three are slight pieces, 
but the fourth, " Of the Eternal Feminine," 
presents very solid material nothing less, in- 
deed, than an attempt to rally and lead the 
Orient in a counter charge on the Occident in 
the matter of the Woman Question. " He who 
would study impartially the life and thought of 
the Orient must also study those of the Occident 
from the Oriental point of view," states the 
author's principle, which leads him to present 
some Japanese criticisms of our relations to 
woman which are original enough to delight 
some and shock others. It appears that while 
Western usage, art, and life are dominated by 
woman, and more generally by personality, the 
East has retained the power of viewing nature

in herself apart from all anthropological media- 
tion. Hence asymmetry, irregularity, variety, 
and kindred traits in Japanese art. The author 
is careful not to overstate his contention, and 
presents a suggestive rather than a formally 
complete article. Those who know well that 
they never saw light or water until Ruskin 
opened their eyes by his description of sunlight 
and of the Rhone, which in the last analysis he 
achieves by interpretation through personality, 
will not be likely to abandon that master's 
method, but may certainly allow the possibility 
of gaining something from the viewing of na- 
ture as such. 

" Bits of Life and Death " describes well 
enough those glimpses of Japanese life the 
strangeness of which justifies insertion here. 
In " The Stone Buddha " we pass to the sub- 
limities of life universal, the question of the 
ultimate meaning and value of life. Here the 
knowledge of Mr. H. Spencer, scientist, is 
shown to run parallel with the enlightenment 
of G. Buddha, seer, except where the seer sur- 
passes the scientist. The notions introduced 
will prove familiar to those abreast with modern 
philosophic thought, but afford the advantage 
of sympathetic treatment and of Oriental set- 
ting. Note the illegitimate passage, also not 
new to those conversant with Buddhist think- 
ers, from the scientific doctrine of heredity to 
the visionary notion of karma, pp. 169-70. 

The essay entitled " Jiujutsu " takes as topic 
the recently demonstrated power of Japan to 
react on Western pressure and assert herself 
in the councils and activities of the wide world. 
She has shown the very highest capacity that 
to learn ; and henceforth Japan must be declared 
not imitative but assimilative or adoptive. This 
wonderful achievement of Japan forces on us 
the problem of the future relations of Occi- 
dentals and Orientals. That the latter can as- 
similate the former's acquisitions on a vastly 
cheaper expenditure, bodes ill to the West, 
which will be undersold because it can be 
underlived. This interesting article is marred 
by strictures upon missions in Japan so violent 
as to preclude the attribution of unbiased judg- 
ment. Such garbling, however, has one ex- 
cuse : the unconsciously, and naturally, almost 
necessarily, one-sided reports of the " heathen " 
which are forwarded to their supporters at home 
by foreign missionaries. One might have 
hoped, however, that the censor would not re- 
peat the error of the censured.

THE BACOXIAX AUTHORSHIP OF 
THE PLAYS.* 



An American Shakespearian critic, Dr. W. 
J. Rolfe, has recently invited contributions from 
his countrymen, of five shillings each, toward 
the presentation of an illuminated address to 
the Rev. Dr. A. Nicholson, of Leamington, En- 
gland, in grateful recognition of " his complete 
refutation of the Donnelly Cryptogram." By 
way of encouragement, it is stated that, in En- 
gland, " Some have subscribed for themselves 
and their wives or other members of their fam- 
ilies." When the air is thus electric with gen- 
erous impulses, one almost wonders that some 
American does not enter the lists, and proceed 
to demolish Dr. Owen's latest " wheel-cipher," 
in the reasonable hope that he will be hon- 
ored with at least a two-shilling " illuminated 
address." 

But while we may enjoy this innocent jubila- 
tion in commemoration of victory in another 
battle with windmills, and though the illumi- 
nation be merely the burning of some very old 
straw, its momentary blaze but reveals the 
depths profound of the neglect into which char- 
latan methods have plunged the entire ques- 
tion of the Baconian authorship of the plays. 
And yet when so many reputable literary men 
among them, Disraeli, for example, are 
known to have entertained very serious convic- 
tions upon the subject, obviously such a ques- 
tion of authorship should be approached soberly, 
from the standpoint of the scholar intent upon 
the discovery of the truth, with an impartial 
weighing of the evidences, with critical acumen, 
and carried on in a spirit truly scientific and 
with a diligent effort to arrive intelligently at 
a definite conclusion. Such was the spirit in 
which Judge Holmes addressed himself to the 
problem, in the pioneer work published many

Forms. By Henry J. Ruggles, author of "The Method of 
Shakespeare as an Artist." Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



years ago by Messrs. Ticknor & Fields of Bos- 
ton the predecessors of the eminent firm 
that now issues the latest contribution to the 
discussion ; and while the earlier work failed 
to convince the public, it commanded respectful 
attention, as will any book written in a like 
spirit, which presents properly additional data. 
Mr. Ruggles, the author of " The Plays of 
Shakespeare," is worthy of commendation for 
the spirit in which he has designed and writ- 
ten his book. He does not even enter into the 
direct discussion of the authorship of the plays : 
instead, he seeks, through a comprehensive com- 
parison of the several plays with Bacon's whole 
system of philosophy in its multiform details, 
to show, critically and visually, that in their 
constitution and in their detailed particulars 
they are the definite outgrowth and concrete 
development of that philosophy. In the exe- 
cution of this task, he presents much fresh 
data. And it must be confessed that in many 
important particulars he enables us to see in 
the plays some striking " vestiges " of Bacon 
as their creator. Yet the book, in itself per- 
haps designedly is still inconclusive. The 
author is evidently a convert to Bacon's admir- 
able method in the inculcation of what is con- 
ceived to be the truth : 

" So I like better that entry of truth which comes 
peaceably as with chalk to mark up those minds which 
are capable to lodge and harbor such a guest, than that 
which forces its way with pugnacity and contention." 

And yet in the use of this method, the author, 
possibly through the excessive zeal of a new 
convert, falls quite into the opposite extreme 
from that which he would avoid. He presents 
an intricate array of evidences, so interwoven 
with a vast number of other particulars, that 
altogether too much labor is imposed upon the 
reader : too great a strain is placed upon his 
constructive imagination, and almost inevitably 
it breaks down under the load. 

If Professor Henry Drummond has accom- 
plished nothing else in his little brochure on 
" The Greatest Thing in the World," he has 
abundantly paid the debt he owed to his profes- 
sion by enforcing upon the attention of men of 
letters, through this example, the old truth that 
in addressing the public the most artistic is 
the most effective presentation. While there 
are some fine passages in the book before us 
as, for example, the delineation of Imogen 
in the discussion of " Cymbeline," yet, test- 
ing the work by this standard, in the ungra- 
cious aspect of criticism, we find that both as a 
whole and in its several chapters it is sadly de-

ficient in the artistic element. The following, 
from the chapter on " The Winter's Tale," is 
perhaps a fair example of the style in which 
much of the book is written: 

" Among the uses of speech stand foremost persua- 
sion and instruction. . . . To give or receive wise coun- 
sel, and thereby remove in others or ourselves the 
troubles of the heart or the perplexities of business, is 
one of the honorablest offices and rarest fruits of friend- 
ship. Thus Bacon says : ' No receipt openeth the heart 
like a true friend to whom you may impart griefs, joys, 
fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and whatever lieth 
upon the heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil shrift or 
confession ' and in the same spirit Leontes says to his 
counsellor, Camillo : 

' I have trusted thee, Camillo ; 
With all the near'st things to my heart, as well 
My chamber-councils : wherein, priest-like, thou 
Hast cleansed my bosom ; I from thee departed 
Thy penitent reform 'd.' 

" Both persuasion and instruction, which in their vari- 
ous forms have a range from the lispings of the child 
to the oratory of the senate-house, may be comprised 
under the head of the communication of knowledge. 
There are two sources of knowledge : experience and 
testimony. The facts of which any one individual has 
certain knowledge are only those which fall under his 
own observation and form but an infinitesimal portion 
of the great mass that makes up the whole truth ; all 
else to him is but opinion, that is probability, or likeli- 
hood supported by testimony. In the most trivial as in 
the most important matters, trust must be placed in the 
sayings and information of others, that is, in testimony, 
and the sum of the knowledge possessed by any com- 
munity is the result of the incessant interchange of in- 
telligence between its individual members as eye-and- 
ar witnesses. Every man, however limited his sphere 
of action, can contribute some knowledge, whereby he 
may often, unwittingly, supply a necessary link in a 
chain of proof, as for instance, the old Shepherd in the 
play communicates facts known only to himself, which 
establish the royal birth of Perdita; and thus through 
the endless intermingling of human affairs ' the in- 
finite doings of the world ' facts of the greatest mo- 
ment which have been lost for years to view are fre- 
quently brought to light by what is called Time and 
Chance." 

After reading an entire chapter, one lays down 
the book almost as wearied as was its author ; 
and however interested in the theme, unless 
impelled by duty the reader is inclined to post- 
pone its further perusal till " a more conven- 
ient season." 

Adopting for the moment the author's un- 
derlying but unexpressed hypothesis of Bacon's 
authorship of the plays, we regret that he had 
not followed more closely, in spirit at least, the 
advice given by the poet in the eighty-fourth 
Sonnet : 

" Lean penury within that pen doth dwell, 
That to his subject lends not some small glory ; 
But he that writes of you, if he can tell 
That you are you, so dignifies his story, 
Let him but copy what in you is writ, 



Not making worse what Nature made so clear, 
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit, 
Making his style admired everywhere." 

The book is a large octavo of seven hundred 
pages ; and we cannot but think that had the 
author omitted the discussion of some of the 
plays considered, or had otherwise abridged it 
to a volume of half the size and at half the 
price, it would have been more effective in the 
accomplishment of his purpose.

PlOXEER IiIFE IN OHIO.* 



The town of Jefferson, in Ohio, had the dis- 
tinction of being the centre of that consistent 
and active opposition to the growth of the slave 
power which made the Western Reserve famous 
thoughout the North more than half a century 
ago. The homes of Joshua R. Giddings and 
Benjamin F. Wade were there. William 
Cooper Howells, the father of the novelist, also 
resided there, and, as the editor of the local pa- 
per, " The Sentinel," promoted the Free Soil 
cause. He was a native of Wales, of a Quaker 
family, gifted with strong intellectual endow- 
ments and blessed with a sunny disposition. 
He did not accumulate money, but his friends 
were numbered by the thousand. He saw every 
side of life, but only the sweet and pure at- 
tracted him. The philosophical reflections of 
such a mind, in whatever age, are worth one's 
attention. Unfortunately, Mr. Howells left, 
outside of the files of the newspaper with which 
he was connected, little material in shape for 
publication. Since his death, which occurred 
last August, Mr. William D. Howells has ed- 
ited and given to the press his father's " Rec- 
ollections of Life in Ohio, from 1813 to 1840." 
The period covered is one of marvellous devel- 
opment. We find here pictured the hardships 
and the romance of pioneer life ; the evolution 
of social order and spiritual influence after 
years of conflict with ignorance, intemperance, 
and too often misdirected religious zeal ; the 
grand beauty of great forests, and streams 
bank-full, before an advanced stage of civiliza- 
tion had levelled or changed them. 

The Howells family crossed the mountains in 
the year 1813, when the author of these " Rec- 
ollections " was six years old.

Ohio, the making of maple sugar was prominent. I also 
heard them talk of singing fish in the Ohio, which so 
impressed me that I listened for the song of the fish as 
soon as we reached the Monongahela. I have since 
heard these singing fish, which are said to be the white 
perch, making a low and very musical hum, just about 
sunset of a June evening, when they would gather be- 
neath a ferry flat-boat, and follow it backward and for- 
ward across the river. The sound they give forth is 
very sweet, but varied by only two or three notes, and 
much like the sound made by a silk string fixed in a 
window." 

The people who settled in Eastern Ohio, be- 
low the Beaver Falls, were mostly Scotch-Irish, 
as were the inhabitants of Western Pennsyl- 
vania. They were light-hearted, prudent and 
thrifty, devoted to Calvinism, " very demo- 
cratic in politics, and they took kindly to 
whisky, of which they made and drank large 
quantities." Whether grain was scarce or 
plenty, or times hard, the rude distilleries were 
kept busy, and custom required that at all social 
gatherings, as well as log-rollings and corn- 
huskings, whisky should be offered as an evi- 
dence of hospitality. In time, temperance so- 
cieties came in to restrict the use of stimulants. 
Money was scarce and the people resorted to 
barter for most articles purchased or produced. 
Tea, coffee, leather, iron, powder, lead, linen, 
cloth, feathers, beeswax, deerskins, and furs 
were cash articles, and could be exchanged one 
for another, or be sold for money which was re- 
quired to pay taxes. Mechanics took their pay 
in grain, their customers providing the articles 
for manufacture. A day's work was equivalent 
to a bushel of wheat, the value of which was 
from thirty-five to fifty cents. It would take 
several bushels to pay for a day's labor now. 
The female members of a family would card, 
spin, and weave the flax or wool, and produce 
the cloth worn by all of its members. Linsey 
cloth, when woven in plaid figures, made a smart 
dress for e very-day wear. Farming work was 
necessarily carried on by mutual help, from the 
raising of the rude log cabins and barns to 
harvesting. Social life was promoted in this 
way. 

" One of the gatherings for joint work, which has to- 
tally disappeared from the agriculture of modern times, 
and one that was always a jolly kind of affair, was the 
corn-husking. It was a sort of harvest -home in its 
department, and it was the more jolly because it was 
a gathering with very little respect to persons, and em- 
braced in the invitation men and big boys, with the un- 
derstanding that no one would be unwelcome. There 
was always a good supper served at the husking, and as 
certainly a good appetite to eat it with. It came at a 
plentiful season, when the turkeys and chickens were 
fat, and a fat pig was at hand, to be flanked on the 
table with good bread in various forms, turnips and po- 



tatoes from the autumn stores, apple and pumpkin pies, 
good coffee, and the like. And the cooking was always 
well done, and all in such bountiful abundance that no 
one feared to eat, while many a poor fellow was certain 
of a 'square meal' by being present at a husking. You 
were sure to see the laboring men of the vicinity out ; 
and the wives of a goodly number of farm hands would 
be on hand to help in the cooking and serving at the 
table." 

The huskers were divided and placed under two 
captains. 

" From the time they began till the corn was all 
husked at one end, there would be steady work, each 
man husking all the corn he could, never stopping ex- 
cept to take a pull at the stone jug of inspiration that 
passed occasionally along the line. ... As soon as one 
party got done they raised a shout, and hoisting their 
captain on their shoulders, carried him over to the other 
side with general cheering. All hands would then turn 
in and finish what remained. The shout at hoisting the 
captain was the signal for bringing the supper on the 
table. This was often followed by dancing after the 
elders had retired, if the man with the fiddle should 
attend. . . . There was a tradition that the boys who 
accidentally husked a red ear, and saved it, would be 
entitled to a kiss from somebody. But I never knew 
it to be necessary to produce a red ear to secure a kiss 
where there was a disposition to give or take one." 

Such are the pleasant glimpses of old-time 
life and manners furnished through the vivid 
recollections of this Ohio pioneer. The final 
chapter, written by Mr. W. D. Howells, and 
covering the closing years of his father's life, 
is full of touching interest.

BRIEFS ox :NEW BOOKS. 



A scholarly 
volume of 
literary essays. 



Mr. John Churton Collins is well 
known as one of the most thoroughly- 
equipped among living students of 
English literature, and as one of the most resolute 
champions of its claims to serious consideration as 
an instrument of culture and the higher discipline. 
He need hardly, then, have apologized for collect- 
ing and republishing, in the handsome volume of 
" Essays and Studies " (Macmillan) now before us, 
a group of his contributions to the periodical litera- 
ture of the past twenty years. He does not lightly 
undertake any piece of work, and the broad scholar- 
ship which informs these essays makes them well 
worthy of preservation. They are five in number. 
The essays on Dryden and Menander need no ex- 
planation. It is hardly necessary to say that Theo- 
bald is the subject of "The Person of Shakespearian 
Criticism." The two remaining essays are re- 
views : " Lord Chesterfield's Letters " of the let- 
ters to Chesterfield's godson published a few years 
ago by Lord Carnarvon, and "The Predecessors of 
Shakespeare " of the work by the late J. A. Sy- 
nionds. The latter of these reviews is somewhat

controversial in tone, and its animadversions upon 
Symonds and his methods of composition are too 
heated to command unqualified assent ; yet there is 
no doubt that they are in part deserved, and that 
the interests of sanity demand an occasional protest 
against the critical extravagances that disfigure the 
works of what Mr. Collins calls " the new school of 
criticism." Mr. Collins here, as always, stands for 
sobriety and carefully-weighed judgments, and we 
are not sure that one may not catch from his pages 
a more finely-tempered enthusiasm for, say, Mar- 
lowe, than from the dithyrambic utterances of Sy- 
monds and Mr. Swinburne. The Chesterfield essay 
is interesting as a " corrected impression." The 
letters to his godson made it fairly evident that 
their writer had been seriously misunderstood by 
the public, and Mr. Collins, in his comments upon 
both series of letters, adduces much evidence to 
make good the claim that Chesterfield was by no 
means the apologist of vice and immorality that he 
is commonly taken to have been. As for the Theo- 
bald essay, its point of view may best be character- 
ized by its opening statement : " It may be said with 
simple truth that no poet in our own or in any lan- 
guage has ever owed so great a debt to an editor as 
Shakespeare owes to this man." 



Introduction to 
the Herbartian 
System. 



Of its kind, Dr. Charles De Garmo's 
" Herbart and the Herbartians " 
(Scribner) is the most important 
book that has recently issued from the press. Within 
a few years, translations of several Herbartian books 
of merit have appeared, as Herbart's " Psychology," 
Lange's " Apperception," Ufer's " Introduction," 
and others ; there have been also numerous original 
discussions, both articles and books, among which 
may be mentioned Dr. De Garmo's own " Essen- 
tials of Method "; but there has been no general 
introduction to the whole Herbartian System, and 
this void the present work worthily fills. Part I. deals 
with Herbart's contribution to education ; Part II. 
with the extension and application of Herbart's edu- 
cational ideas in Germany ; Part III. with Her- 
bart's ideas in America. The author is easily the 
first Herbartian authority in the country not the 
most enthusiastic, perhaps, but certainly the most 
comprehensive, even-minded, and judicious. While 
he is in accord with Herbartism as a movement, or 
stream of tendency, he is by no means a stickler for 
everything that bears the label, or even an advocate 
of all the ideas that the creator of the school himself 
propounded. He discards, or at least ignores, much 
of Herbart's metaphysics in the outset, and steadily 
holds in view the pedagogical outcome of the sys- 
tem. He tells us that " the system, after all, de- 
pends not upon the construction of abstract specu- 
lation, but upon verifiable facts and experience," 
and that "to recognize the importance of Herbart's 
contribution to pedagogy, it is by no means neces- 
sary to accept his metaphysical presupposition as to 
the nature and original equipment of the soul." 
Whatever place this system may ultimately hold in 



pedagogical thought, there can be no doubt that at 
present it is attracting rapidly increasing attention ; 
and no competent judge will hesitate in pronounc- 
ing this work the very best general view of the sub- 
ject that has been written in the English language. 
It is the last volume of the well-known series, " The 
Great Educators." 



Life and 
Essays of 
G. W. Curtis. 



A collection of " Literary and Social 
Essays " by the late George William 
Curtis (Harper), and Mr. Edward 
Gary's life of Mr. Curtis in the " American Men 
of Letters" series (Houghton), appear at the same 
time, and enable us to test the one by the other. 
The biography tells of the social instincts, the mus- 
ical gifts, the artistic nature of the man ; while the 
essays, by their penetrating and sympathetic treat- 
ment of such different characters as Thackeray, 
Rachel, O. W. Holmes, and Washington Irving, 
confirm the story. The biography reports Mr. Cur- 
tis's connection with Emerson and Brook Farm, thus 
adding to the interest of the three fine papers em- 
bodying personal reminiscences relating to Emerson 
and Hawthorne. But perhaps the most charming 
of the essays is one, now published for the first 
time, having for its subject Sir Philip Sidney. In 
reading this essay, we feel that much that Mr. Cur- 
tis says of Sidney might, with equal truth, have been 
said of himself. For example, this passage : " Sid- 
ney had that happy harmony of mind and temper, 
of enthusiasm and good-sense, of accomplishment 
and capacity, which is described by that most ex- 
quisite and most abused word, gentleman. A gen- 
tleman is not an idler, a trifler, a dandy ; he is not 
a scholar only, a soldier, a mechanic, a merchant ; 
he is the flower of men, in whom the accomplish- 
ment of the scholar, the bravery of the soldier, the 
skill of the mechanic, the sagacity of the merchant, 
all have their part and appreciation. A sense of 
duty is his main-spring, and, like a watch crusted 
with precious stones, his function is not to look pret- 
tily but to tell the time of day." This " sense of 
duty as a main-spring " is what impresses us most 
distinctly and firmly in the character of George 
William Curtis.

the " sweet security of the Three Per Cents " at 
home. Coffee planting, prospecting, mining, treas- 
ure hunting, etc., were tried in turn, and each turn 
of the wheel left Mr. Jebb poorer than before. Says 
Mr. Haggard : " I believe I am right in saying that 
he never once got the best of a bargain, or had to 
do with an enterprise which proved successful so 
far as his own interests were concerned." Mr. Jebb 
was organically unfit for mercantile life. An hon-

orable gentleman himself, he knew but one code of 
morality the absolute code; and each new revel- 
ation of commercial crookedness came upon him as 
a fresh and staggering surprise. The City of Mex- 
ico was the field of his last venture. Here again 
he fell among traders, with the old result. Said a 
" business man " of that city, not without candor : 
" He was a good man, Jebb, a man among a thou- 
sand, whom I would trust anywhere. See, I will 
prove it to you, Amigo ; he lived in this town for 
years, yet, with all his opportunities, he leaves it 
poorer than he came here. Did you ever hear the 
like of that, Amigo'?" Mr. Jebb's record remains 
as that of a brave and generous man, with the soul 
of a knight-errant and the guilelessness of a child, 
who, " with all his opportunities," never did, or even 
contemplated, a mean or a doubtful act. As such, 
and as a tale of stirring adventure, the record is 
worth the reading.

England 01 Elizabeth and the same 
country under the rule of the infatuated sister whom 
she succeeded. The transition from the weakness 
and dissensions of the former period, when England 
had lost its prestige abroad and had degenerated 
into little else than a province of Spain, to the 
strength and vigor of Elizabeth's reign, which de- 
veloped the island kingdom into the most powerful 
and influential country in the world, is at first sight 
almost incomprehensible. Mr. Allen B. Hinds, a 
scholar of Christ Church, Oxford, in his essay en- 
titled "The England of Elizabeth" (Macmillan), 
has attempted to search out the causes of this mar- 
vellous reaction, so far as they may be found in the 
great religious movements which characterized the 
times. The first part of the book contains a history 
of those Protestants who fled from England in the 
beginning of Mary's reign to seek refuge in France 
and Germany. The author describes with consid- 
erable minuteness the unfortunate doctrinal dissen- 
sions which rent the exiles into a number of hostile 
factions, especially in Frankfort, Geneva, and Zu- 
rich. He then passes to England, and traces, in an 
interesting chapter, the growth of the new spirit 
there. The book, though small, has cost much pa- 
tient investigation and study, and is a really valu- 
able contribution to the religious history of the period. 

A short fits- The want of a concise, authorita- 

toryofthe tive history of the British navy is 

satisfactorily met by Mr. Hamilton 
Williams's " Britain's Naval Power " (Macmillan). 
The author is instructor in English literature to 
the naval cadets in H. M. S. " Britannia." He 
has drawn largely upon the naval histories of 
Campbell, South ey, and Yonge, as well as upon 
the later works of Mr. Froude and Captain Ma- 
han, and has succeeded in "boiling down" and 
shaping his multifarious material into a readable 
and fairly comprehensive and continuous narrative 



of 250 pages. The book opens with the building 
of the first British fleet by Alfred (the founder of 
England's historic "wooden walls" policy), and 
closes with the crowning naval glory of Trafalgar. 
The American reader will object that the author's 
cutting short of his narrative at this point savors 
more of patriotism than candor, since it ignores the 
war with this country in 1812 surely a consid- 
erable factor in the record, breaking in as it did 
rudely and disastrously upon the almost uninter- 
rupted tale of British maritime victory. In these 
two and a half years of naval war with the United 
States, English commerce was almost annihilated, 
and in fifteen out of eighteen engagements the once 
invincible royal navy was signally defeated. As 
the London " Times " confessed, when the loss of 
the second royal frigate was announced, the " sea 
spell " of Great Britain was broken. But Mr. Will- 
iams's in most respects admirable little book is pri- 
marily meant for the young gentlemen of Her 
Majesty's navy, who would scarcely relish or be in- 
spired by such episodes as the actions between the 
" Constitution " and the " Guerriere," the " United 
States " and the " Macedonian," the " Hornet " and 
" Peacock," etc. The book is profusely and in- 
structively illustrated.

for Teachers" (Silver, Burdette & Co.) is a well- 
organized presentation of the aims, principles, and 
plans of every-day teaching, with illustrative lessons, 
that have made her one of the foremost representa- 
tives of the new ideas and methods in elementary 
schools. It is a good sign that the book is entitled 
"Way-Marks" and not a "way," "road," or 
" path." The title is suggested by the well-known 
incident in the history of Christian and Faithful. 
when they returned to the stile after they had es- 
caped from Giant Despair. Many readers will seek 
out the book because they are already familiar in a 
general way with its contents, desiring to possess 
them in a more permanent form ; and many more 
will seek it out because they are not familiar with 
its contents and desire to become so.

"Economic Classics " (Macmillan), each of which 
is a selection from the work of some one of the 
great economists. Three volumes have appeared. 
The first contains " Select Chapters and Passages

About one-fifth of the entire work is given, includ-

the real structure of Adam Smith's argument." The

first and second editions (1798-1803) of Malthus's 
" Essay on the Principle of Population," with a few 
added passages from the editions of 1807 and 1817. 
The third volume gives us the first six chapters of 
Ricardo's " Principles of Political Economy and 
Taxation," forming about one-fourth of the whole 
treatise. The usefulness of these handy volumes 
should be very great. The three classical English 
writers who laid the foundations of economic science 
are still surprisingly vital and stimulating. It has 
become popular of late, especially among the meta- 
physical theorists and the historical economists, to 
speak slightingly and even patronizingly of these 
great men, but this, we trust, is only a transient phase 
of discussion. We are confident that in the not very 
distant future of economic thought we shall hear 
the cry of " back to Ricardo," just as philosophy 
has heard the cry of " back to Kant " within the 
past decade or two. Such books as these which 
Professor Ashley has edited will contribute to the 
emancipation of economic science from the vagaries 
that now have possession of a part of the field. 
Other volumes are promised for Mun, Child, Tur- 
got, Quesnai, and Roscher. 

A certain accent throughout of essen-

lends to Mrs. Mena C. Pfirshing's 
" Memories of Italian Shores " a charm irrespective 
of its perennially charming theme. Mrs. Pfirshing 
sailed for Genoa in the Spring of 1893, visiting in 
turn Pisa, Rome, Naples, Ischia, Pompeii, Psestum, 
Salerno, Amalfi, and Sorrento. Her unpretentious 
little sheaf of Reisebilder shows conclusively that 
her journey to the land of the olive and vine was 
not an altogether unsentimental one. The touch is 
light, the treatment fresh and individual, and the 
writer's enthusiasm for Italy and its treasures is 
evidently genuine. Mrs. Pfirshing's book is issued 
in a limited edition of two hundred copies.

compact yet comprehensive account of " The Inns of 
Court and Chancery " (Macmillan) . No part of the 
metropolis is richer in historical and personal asso- 
ciations than this intricate maze of courts and build- 
ings to which Mr. Loftie now furnishes a satisfac- 
tory clue. Besides describing the various halls, 
inns, chapels, etc., he traces their history from the 
foundation down, interspersing his narrative with 
anecdotes of such famous occupants as More, Donne, 
Lamb, Cowper, Boswell, Thurlow, Brougham, and 
many others. The book is profusely illustrated with 
the graceful drawings of Mr. Herbert Railton. 



The interest of military men espe- 
cially is appealed to by Lieutenant 
Herbert H. Sargent's concise account 
of " Napoleon Bonaparte's First Campaign " (Mc- 
Clurg). The Italian campaign of 1796, though con- 



Napoleori's

ducted on a less imposing scale than many of the 
Emperor's later undertakings, was surpassed by 
none of them from a strategic standpoint. It is 
therefore still exceptionally worthy the attention 
of military students the application of strategical 
principles being, as Dufour says, " the same at all 
times and places." Lieutenant Sargent writes 
mainly from the professional point of view. Each 
campaign is treated in a separate chapter, and to 
each chapter is appended a brief summary, critical 
and expository. Several good maps enhance the 
value of the book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The Book of the Rose" (Macmillan), by the Rev. 
A. Foster-Melliar, is designed " to give, from an ama- 
teur, full details of practical culture for amateurs from 
the beginning to the end," " to give such descriptions 
of the best known roses as should tell of their faults 
and bad habits as well as of their good qualities and 
perfections," and " to make a readable as well as use- 
ful book." In all of these aims the author seems to 
have been successful, and, in spite of his modest depre- 
cation of any comparison between Dean Hole's classic 
treatise and his own, we are inclined to think that the 
new book deserves a place by the side of the old. 

General William Haines Lytle occupies a modest but 
assured place in American literature on the strength of 
a single poem, the exquisite lyric, " Antony and Cleo- 
patra." It is not generally known that he was the author 
of a considerable amount of other verse, some of which, 
although it never caught the public ear, must be placed 
by the critic nearly if not quite upon the level of the 
piece which is so familiar. To collect the bulk of this 
work, and to introduce it with a sympathetic personal 
memoir, has been the task of Mr. W. H. Venable, a task 
performed con amore, and that could not easily have 
fallen into more competent hands. " Poems of William 
Haines Lytle " is the title of the book, which is pub- 
lished by the Robert Clarke Co. of Cincinnati. 

Mr. Joseph A. Willard, Clerk of the Massachusetts 
Superior Court, has collected in a shapely volume of 
some 360 pages his recollections of " Half a Century 
with Judges and Lawyers " (Houghton). The stories, 
bon mots, witness-box humors, judicial obiter dicta, etc., 
which fill the book are mainly of a humorous cast ; and 
while losing in print much of their pristine point and 
flavor, they will be found amusing, especially by mem- 
bers of the legal profession. 

The " Dry burgh " edition of the Waverley novels, 
some time since completed (Macmillan), is now sup- 
plemented by a two- volume edition of Scott's poems, 
uniform with the prose, except for the absence of illus- 
trations. Mr. Andrew Lang is the editor, and in his 
introductory essay he contrives, as usual, to say the 
right and the happy thing at not too great length. 
There is little to choose between this edition and that 
edited a year or so ago by Professor Norton. 

Mr. Leslie Stephen's " The Playground of Europe " 
(Longmans) is one of the classics of mountaineering, 
and a new edition of the work is welcome. The author 
has the following introductory note : " In republishing 
these papers of a young gentleman, whom I shall regard 
with a certain interest, I have not felt myself at liberty

to make any serious corrections. He would possibly 
have denied the force of some critical remarks which 
to me appear very obvious ; and I do not know that my 
judgment would be superior to his. I have therefore 
left all faults of omission and commission in the repub- 
lished chapters." The author has, however, substituted 
three new chapters for the " Eastern Carpathians," which 
he styles irrelevant, and for " Alpine Dangers," which 
now seems to him obsolete. 

"The National School Library of Song" (Ginn), 
edited by Mr. Leo R. Lewis, " will present, in a number 
of small volumes, musical material adapted to varied 
wants in upper grades of musical instruction in schools." 
The distinctive feature of the first volume, now at 
hand, is the collection of folk-songs from a score or 
more of nations. The educational value of such music 
is very great. We are particularly glad to find the 
Danish " King Christian " among these pieces. The 
other contents of the book are patriotic, devotional, and 
occasional songs. 

German texts for school use are not multiplied as 
rapidly as French ones, but several have been received 
of late. " A Scientific German Reader " (Ginn), by Dr. 
G. T. Dippold, is interesting in its matter and well 
illustrated. Messrs. Heath & Co. send "Kleine Ge- 
schichten," by Richard von Volkmann, edited by Dr. 
W. Bernhardt, and Gerstiicker's " Germelshausen," ed- 
ited by Mr. Carl Osthaus. Mr. Lawrence Fossler edits 
Herr Baumbach's " Frau Holde," and Mr. Frank Vogel 
edits " Peter Schlemihl " both for Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. 



THE CLASSICAL, CONFERENCE AT 
ANN ARBOR. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
The meeting of classical teachers at Ann Arbor, held 
on March 27 and 28, was quite fairly representative of 
the district included in the invitations that were issued. 
The Conference was due to the enthusiasm and energy 
of Professor Kelsey, of the University of Michigan, and 
the success of the affair must fully have met his expec- 
tations. College professors and high-school teachers of 
Greek and Latin were present in large numbers, from 
the Atlantic to the Mississippi, and from Lake Superior 
to the Ohio; and the full and varied programme of pa- 
pers and discussions was carried through without delays 
or interruptions. 

The object of the Conference was twofold: " First, to 
give to those doing work in Latin, Greek, and Ancient 
History, an opportunity to present the results of re- 
search; and, second, to discuss questions of fundamen- 
tal importance to the interests of classical study, par- 
ticularly in the Central and Western States." The first 
of these two objects was attained by the reading and 
discussion of more than thirty papers at the morning 
and afternoon sessions; and the second, by the more 
formal and elaborate addresses delivered in the evenings. 
On Wednesday evening the question " Shall we have a 
six years' High School Latin Course? " was discussed by 
Professors West of Princeton and Hale of Chicago, from 
the point of view of the university; and by Mr. A. F. 
Nightingale of Chicago, from the point of view of the 
high school. The speakers advocated the extension of 
the preparatory course in Latin, and their arguments 
met with general favor, though there was some opposi- 



tion. The introduction of Latin into the grammar 
grades was upheld as good for Latin itself; as good 
for other language work, notably that in English and 
French; and as tending to obliterate the sharp lines of 
distinction between the eighth and ninth grades of 
school work. 

Another interesting deliverance was the report of the 
committee appointed to consider the question " What 
should be the preparation of those who purpose to teach 
Latin and Greek? " This committee, composed of a 
dozen professors and schoolmen, with Professor Bennett 
of Cornell as chairman, unanimously reported the fol- 
lowing resolution, which the Conference as unanimously 
adopted: 

" Resolved, that this Conference desires to express its 
sense of the importance of a thorough training for teach- 
ers in all grades of classical instruction. Especially does 
it urge adequate preparation for the work of secondary 
instruction. The instructor should know much more 
than he is called upon to impart to his pupils. In the 
high school, the ideal teacher of the classics will be one 
who has not only specialized in these branches as under- 
graduate and graduate, but who also, by instinct and 
training, possesses the enthusiasm to add constantly to 
past attainment by new study." 

The sessions of the Conference had a brilliant finale 
on Thursday evening, in the masterly address of Pro- 
fessor Paul Shorey, of the University of Chicago, on 
" The Classics in Modern Education," to which nothing 
short of a verbatim report could do justice. This was 
followed by the Hymn to Apollo recently discovered at 
Delphi, explained by Professor D'Ooge, and magnifi- 
cently sung by Professor Lamson, both of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan. 

The significance and results of this important educa- 
tional gathering are of course difficult to estimate. In 
setting up high standards of instruction, in awakening 
new enthusiasm, and in binding the teachers of classics 
by new and strong ties of sympathy, it was worth all 
that it cost. JOSIAH R. SMITH.

LITERARY NOTES. 



A sixteen-volume Wordsworth, edited by Professor 
Knight, is announced by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

The increasing interest in the subject of book-plates 
is attested by the exhibition of a private collection, num- 
bering over four thousand examples, at Brentano's, 
Chicago, closing April 20. 

" The Citizen," a monthly paper published in Phila- 
delphia, and devoted mainly to the interests of Univer- 
sity Extension, has already issued two numbers. It de- 
serves a welcome for its careful editing, its attractive 
contents, and its praiseworthy aim. 

The celebration of the Tasso tercentenary occurs on 
the 25th of this month. Among the publications in 
honor of the occasion will be the " Vita," by Sig. Solerti, 
a critical edition of the great epic, edited by the above- 
named biographer, and the third volume of " Opere 
Minori," containing Tasso's plays, and edited by Sig. 
Carducci. 

The volume of " Miscellaneous Studies," by the late 
Mr. Pater, which is now in the press, will include his 
well-known essays on " Romanticism " and " The Child 
in the House," and also papers on Prosper Me'rime'e,

on Raphael, on Apollo in Picardy, on Notre Dante 
d'Amiens, and on Pascal. The volume is being edited 
by Mr. Shadwell. 

Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. are bringing out a new 
edition of their one - volume abridgment of Alison's 
" History of Europe " and a revision of their " Popular 
History of the United States." They also announce a 
volume on " The English Versions of the Bible," by the 
Rev. B. Condit, and one on " The Signers of the Decla- 
ration," by Mr. N. Dwight. 

The publication of a quarterly review of historical 
studies, under the auspices of a committee represent- 
ing half a dozen of our leading universities, appears to 
be practically assured. Harvard and Cornell broached 
the subject, and, at a meeting of those interested, called 
in New York for April 6, a board of editors was ap- 
pointed, and plans laid for securing the necessary finan- 
cial support. 

In the days of Old Japan, before the canny islanders 
saw themselves as others saw them, Townsend Harris, 
the first American envoy, lived at Shimoda and Yedo, 
from 1856 to 1862. He kept a journal of his strange 
experiences and wonderful successes. This, edited by 
Dr. William Elliot Griffis, with a portrait and biogra- 
phy, will be published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. 

The " Literary School " of the Chicago Kindergarten 
College is now engaged upon its eighth annual course 
of lectures. Myths " is the general subject of discus- 
sion, a subject treated broadly enough to permit of such 
papers as " Theology and Literature," by Dr. H. W. 
Thomas; " Folk-Lore Legends and Tales," by Professor 
Frederick Starr; and " Nature and Culture," by Mr. H. 
W. Mabie. The lectures close on the twentieth of April. 

Among the very last letters written by Mr. Whittier 
was a short one to a literary friend, referring in com- 
plimentary terms to this journal. This letter having 
occasioned considerable comment by its appearance in 
the poet's " Life and Letters " with the name of the 
journal referred to by Mr. Whittier omitted, we are 
enabled, through the courtesy of the owner of the letter, 
to present an interesting facsimile of it elsewhere in this 
issue. It was written only about three weeks before 
the author's death. 

We learn from the " Athenaeum " that Mr. Mackenzie 
Bell is writing a book on Christina Rossetti, which will be 
largely a critical study based on a detailed survey of her 
work. The opening chapter will contain some biograph- 
ical information and personal reminiscences; while sub- 
sequent chapters will be devoted respectively to her 
general poems, her religious poems, her books for chil- 
dren, and her religious prose volumes. In the conclud- 
ing chapter an attempt will be made to estimate her 
place as a writer. Mr. Bell's intention is to make his 
book popular enough to become to some readers an in- 
troduction to Christina Rossetti both as poet and prose 
writer. 

Our valued contributor Dr. Fitzedward Hall has in 
the last " Academy " a further communication upon 
Americanisms, from which we make this excerpt: " The 
interest which Americans of the better sort take in the 
subject of Americanisms is attested by their books de- 
voted to them, and notably by the dictionaries of Mr. 
Bartlett and Professor De Vere. Unhappily, however, 
among those for whose benefit they were intended, there 
are three classes, out of four, for whom they have been 
compiled either to no purpose or to very little. One of 



these three classes, which embraces a large portion of 
the enormous mob connected with the despicable and 
detestable newspaper-press, while chiefly originating 
Americanisms, actually revels in them. Another class, in- 
cluding an overwhelming majority of the population, 
regards them with absolute indifference. The third 
class, in which come, with others, the generality of pro- 
fessional authors, cares to eschew only such of them as 
are tabooed by tolerably refined society. Far otherwise, 
the members of the fourth class, comparatively a very 
small one, strive industriously to acquire passable En- 
glish; and, if due allowance is made for their unavoid- 
ably hearing and reading the most abominable jargon 
every day of their lives, it may be acknowledged that 
their efforts to express themselves like civilized beings 
are rewarded with as much success as could be expected. 
Such persons, if corrected, one by another, for Amer- 
icanizing unnecessarily, are always very thankful. And 
they are, certainly, quite as thankful, if the same serv- 
ice is done them, with ordinary courtesy, by an English- 
man. That it should be done by him, as so often hap- 
pens, with the contumely and invidious reflections which 
are hardly earned except by filching a purse or spheter- 
izing a neighbour's spoons, seems, however, to an Amer- 
ican, disproportionate."

T. W. Ehys-Davids. 

Historic Doubts Relative to 
Napoleon. 

By Archbishop WHATELY. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

A new and attractive edition of this masterpiece of soph- 
istry, in which the author of the celebrated " Elements of 
Logic " takes the novel position that the actual existence of 
such a character as Napoleon cannot be proved, and in which, 
by a series of unanswerable syllogisms, he throws grave doubts 
on the whole Napoleonic "legend." 

Incidentally, the book is a worthy retort to Hume's " Essay 
on Miracles." The archbishop shows us that the same reasons 
can be adduced for disbelieving the existence of Napoleon as 
Hume brought forward for doubting the veracity of the Gos- 
pels.

DEGENERATION. 

By Prof. MAX NOKDAU. Translated from the second edition 

of the German work. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

" The wit and learning, the literary skill and the scientific method, 
the righteous indignation and the ungovernable prejudice displayed in 
Nordau's treatise on ' Degeneration ' attracted to it, on its first appear- 
ance in Germany, an attention that was partly astonished and partly

first volumes, and his work is constantly growing better and more val- 
uable as he brings it nearer our own times. His style is clear, simple,

THE CRIMINOLOGY SERIES. 

Edited by DOUGLAS MORRISON. 

The Female Offender. By Professor LOMBROSO. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The study of criminal tendencies is occupying advanced stu- 
dents throughout the world, but the science has been carried 
further by the Italian school of criminologists than by any 
other scientists. The influences of heredity, the psychological 
study of criminals, the mutual relations of offenders and so- 
ciety, the measures which society should adopt, and other 
aspects of the problem, are treated in these books by the most 
advanced students of the subject. This series embodies the 
most interesting and suggestive results of extended investiga- 
tions. The subject is dealt with from the scientific, not from 
the purely philanthropic, point of view, but the conclusions 
must necessarily form the basis for humanitarian endeavor. 
In "The Female Offender" we see the manner in which 
Lombroso applies the anthropological method. He examines 
whether, and to what extent, the female criminal differs from 
the average woman in bodily and mental characteristics. As 
a result of this examination he arrives at many interesting 
conclusions as to the personal or individual conditions which 
are calculated to turn women into offenders against criminal 
law.

HANDBOOK OF BIRDS 

OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. With Keys to the Species ; 
Descriptions of their Plumages, Nests, etc.; their Distribu- 
tion and Migrations. By FRANK M. CHAPMAN, Assistant 
Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology, American Museum 
of Natural History. With over 200 Illustrations. 12mo, 
cloth and field edition. 

The author's position has not only given him exceptional 
opportunities for the preparation of a work which may be con- 
sidered as authoritative, but has brought him in direct con- 
tact with beginners in the study of birds whose wants he thus 
thoroughly understands. The technicalities so confusing to 
the amateur are avoided, and by the use of illustrations, con- 
cise descriptions, analytical keys, dates of migration, and re- 
marks on distribution, haunts, notes, and characteristic 
habits, the problem of identification, either in the field or 
study, is reduced to its simplest terms. 

FAMILIAR FLOWERS OF FIELD 
AND GARDEN. 

By F. SCHUYLER MATHEWS. Illustrated with 200 Drawings 
by the Author. 12mo, cloth and field edition. 
In this convenient and useful volume the flowers which one 
finds in the fields are identified, illustrated, and described in 
familiar language. Their connection with garden flowers is 
made clear. Particular attention is drawn to the beautiful 
ones which have come under cultivation, and, as the title in- 
dicates, the book furnishes a ready guide to a knowledge of 
wild and cultivated flowers alike. 

AN AIDE-DE-CAMP OF NAPOLEON. 

Memoirs of General Count DE SEGUR. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 
This volume forms a natural companion or pendant to the 
" Memoirs of the Baron de Me'neval." The Count de Se'gur's 
military career began in 1800. He was made a general in 1812 , 
and took part in all the wars of the Empire as a member of 
Napoleon's staff or the commander of a select corps. Hohen- 
linden, missions to Denmark and Spain, the execution of the 
Due d'Enghien, the preparations for the invasion of England. 
Austerlitz, Ulm, Jena, Berlin, Spain, and the intrigues of 
Pouche* and Bernadotte, are among the subjects of his chap- 
ters treated with the advantages of personal knowledge, and, 
in the earlier pages, of intimate information due to his father's 
associations and position. The historical value of the mem- 
oirs is obvious, and their interest is enhanced by the author's 
graphic and lucid style. 

GENERAL SHERIDAN. 

By General HENRY E. DA VIES. With Portrait and Maps. A 
new volume in the Great Commanders Series. 12mo, cloth, 
gilt top, $1.50. 

General Davies served with distinction in the Cavalry Corps 
of the Army of the Potomac under General Sheridan, and took

THE IBSEN LEGEND. 

One of the most curious chapters of literary 
history is that which deals with the greatest of 
Roman poets as he appeared to the imagination 
of the Middle Ages. The Master Virgil of 
mediaevalism stands out as a vivid enough fig- 
ure, exerting a marked influence upon the cur- 
rent of mediaeval thought ; yet how unlike the 
personality of the Mantuan as he appears to 
us, with our fuller knowledge of classical times, 
and the truer intellectual perspective of our 
view. It was a singular refraction, indeed, that 
shaped the outlines of the poet into the dis- 
torted figure of the wizard, a strange limitation 
of outlook that in so literal a sense made of his 
name a word with which to conjure, while blind 
to his genius and its true significance. Books 
have their fates, runs the Latin saying, and pre- 
sumably their authors no less. But never was 
the fate of bookman more ironical than that 
of the poet of the " JEueid " and the " Fourth 
Eclogue," envisaged, a thousand years after his 
death, as an allegorist and a wonder-worker. 

It is a far cry, in more ways than one, from 
Virgil to Dr. Ibsen, and there is but a single 
fact that could lead us even for a moment to 
couple their names. That fact is the preva- 
lence and seemingly continued growth, at least 
in England and America, of an Ibsen legend, 
grotesquely divergent from the truth, and cal- 
culated to make of the Norwegian poet and dra- 
matist a figure as unlike his real self as Master 
Virgil was unlike the poet who chiefly made 
glorious the Augustan Age. Our newspapers, 
and even some of our serious organs of opinion, 
afford frequent indications that the popular 
consciousness holds Dr. Ibsen to be the poet 
of gloom, of the morbid aspects of character, 
of the seamy side of life and the unsavory 
among human relations. A German sensation- 
alist, long discredited, but whose latest work is 
just now getting much attention, finds in Dr. 
Ibsen a conspicuous illustration of what he 
calls Entartung. A typical newspaper article 
just now under our eye, an article of the bet- 
ter sort and evidently written in all seriousness, 
calls him " grim " and " egotistical," speaks of 
his " icy indifference," his " dank philosophy," 
and his " intolerable pessimism." No one who 
does much reading in current criticism can

have failed more than once to come across even 
the suggestion that he deliberately panders to 
the lower instincts of human nature, that he 
revels in what is revolting and unclean. 

Anyone who has read the writings of Dr. Ib- 
sen, and who knows something of the aims and 
ideals that they embody, rubs his eyes in won- 
derment when he meets with such epithets and 
opinions as have just been mentioned. But 
when amazement at the misconception has a lit- 
tle abated, he is apt to ask himself if there is any 
possible way of accounting for the origin of opin- 
ions so grotesque, unless, indeed, he summarily 
sets them down as adding another to the many 
existing illustrations of the essential irrationality 
of the majority of minds. The last count of the 
indictment above outlined may safely be left to 
shift for itself. There is no shred of evidence 
for it, and no sane mind could for a moment 
seriously entertain the suggestion. Nor is it 
without reluctance that we so far consider the 
poet's " icy indifference-" as to recall the infi- 
nite tenderness of " Brand " and " Peer Gynt," 
or illustrate his " dank philosophy " by the pas- 
sionate idealism of " Love's Comedy " and 
" Emperor and Galilean." The reader is to be 
pitied, indeed, who is not stirred to the depths 
of his soul by the agonies of Brand as child and 
wife are taken from him one after the other, or 
by that vision of the " third kingdom " which, 
in the story of Julian, casts its mystical glamour 
over the last struggle of dying paganism, and 
which might have been inspired by the choruses 
of Shelley's Hellas." 

The last of these illustrations leads us to the 
subject upon which more than a word or a ref- 
erence is needed. Of all the charges commonly 
made against Dr. Ibsen, that of pessimism is 
probably the most persistent. This is not sur- 
prising when we consider the ignorant way in 
which that term is bandied about by most peo- 
ple, yet here, if ever, the accusation calls for 
an energetic protest. Pessimism is both a 
mood and a philosophical doctrine. Whatever 
standing it has, considered in its latter aspect, 
it owes to the authority of Schopenhauer, who, 
by logic convincing at least to himself, thought 
he had demonstrated the soul of things to be 
evil, believed irremediable suffering to lie at 
the root of conscious existence. To this doc- 
trine the whole of Dr. Ibsen's work is tacitly 
but resolutely opposed. He never presents to us 
the gloomy side of life without suggesting the 
possibility of something better, rarely without 
indicating the way out of what seems an im- 
passe to the soul of little faith. So far from 



preaching evil as irremediable, he constantly 
ascribes it to lack of knowledge, infirmity of 
vision, and weakness of will. If there is any 
one trait dominant above all others throughout 
his writings, it is the persistent note of an 
idealism unshaken by 

" The absurdity of men, 
Their vaunts, their feats," 

an idealism as absolutely opposed as anything 
well can be to the philosophical doctrine of pes- 
simism. If Dr. Ibsen is to be styled a pes- 
simist in this sense, it must be in the company 
of all the satirists, ancient and modern, who 
have scourged the vices of mankind, and all 
the moralists who have discerned the good life 
and sought to bring about its realization in 
fact no less than in dream. 

Of pessimism as a mood it may be said that 
Dr. Ibsen exhibits it as it has been exhibited 
by greater men than he, from Homer to Ten- 
nyson, by a large proportion, in fact, of the 
greatest poets that have ever lived. This merely 
means that he does not, like such men as Brown- 
ing and Emerson, deliberately exclude from his 
view a large share of the facts of human life, 
that he is not content to build for himself a 
fool's paradise and dwell therein. He is not 
to be deluded by 

" The barren optimistic sophistries 
Of comfortable moles," 

and endeavors, according to the light that is in 
him, to see life steadily and see it whole. Like 
all writers of the second or third rank, he has 
his limitations, and his vision is defective ; but 
to describe his prevalent mood as pessimistic, or 
even as cynical, is grossly to pervert the truth. 
The principal reasons for the current mis- 
conception of Dr. Ibsen's fundamental attitude 
towards life may be briefly set forth. In the 
first place, much of his work is satirical, and 
this fact, combined with his power of express- 
ing the white heat of indignation, naturally 
makes many people think that only one at heart 
a cynic could find so much to condemn in the 
conduct and the ideals of his fellow-men. In 
the second place, his work is nearly all dramatic 
in form, and dramatists always suffer from a 
more or less unconscious identification with the 
characters of their own creation, however ob- 
jectively conceived. Last of all, and most im- 
portant as far as the English-speaking public 
is concerned, he unfortunately first became 
known, and is still chiefly known, by means of 
a group of his least characteristic and enduring 
works. Most people get their whole notion of 
him from a group of three or four plays which 
deal with extremely narrow and specific social

problems, which are utterly inadequate to con- 
vey his essential message, and which embody 
no suggestion of the high poetic energy with 
which his really great work is charged. It is 
not altogether surprising that the " Ibsen 
legend " should find credence with readers who 
know only "A Doll Home," "Ghosts," 
" Hedda Gabler," and " Solness." To such, 
and to all who would know what Dr. Ibsen 
really stands for, we proffer the advice to read 
" Brand " and " Peer Gynt," those master- 
pieces of robust social philosophy and high eth- 
ical aim. Their invigorating moral atmosphere 
has the tonic quality of which our flabby civili- 
zation is most in need ; their lofty idealism may 
well put to shame our opportunism, our half- 
heartedness, and all the paltry conventionalities 
by which our lives are misshapen. And we ven- 
ture to say that whoever once takes those works 
to heart will hardly thereafter describe their au- 
thor as a pessimist, or talk glibly of his " icy 
indifference " and his " dank philosophy." For 
such readers, at least, the " Ibsen legend " will 
be at once consigned to the limbo to which 
grown-up men and women relegate the nursery 
tales and pious fables that were literally ac- 
cepted in childhood, but that cannot impose 
upon the rationalized adult intelligence. 



JAMES DWIGHT DANA. 



The death, on the fourteenth of April, of the veteran 
geologist James Dwight Dana, made American science 
the poorer by one of its most illustrious representatives. 
Professor Dana was born in 1813, at Utica, N. Y. He 
entered Yale at sixteen, attracted by Silliman's fame, 
and after being graduated with the class of 1833, spent 
two years in the government service as a mathematical 
instructor of midshipmen, visiting many parts of the 
world with the ships to which he was assigned. On his 
return from these journeyings, he became Silliman's as- 
sistant at Yale, and prepared the " System of Miner- 
alogy," which appeared in 1837. The year following, 
he started to circumnavigate the globe with the Wilkes 
expedition, the voyage lasting four years. During these 
years, he took charge of the expedition departments of 
geology, mineralogy, and zoology, and made many val- 
uable collections. The thirteen years following his re- 
turn were chiefly occupied in preparing for publication 
the scientific results of his journey. The subjects of the 
volumes resulting (printed by the government) were 
" Zoophytes," " Crustacea," and " Geology of the Pa- 
cific." In 1844 he settled for life in New Haven, and 
married Miss Henrietta Frances Silliman, who survives 
him. His late publications include " Coral Reefs and 
Islands," " The Geological Story Briefly Told," and the 
much revised " Manual of Geology " which has been our 
standard text-book of the subject for the past thirty 
years. The life record just closed is one of singular 
industry, achievement, and honor; the place he has va- 
cated in our intellectual life will not easily be filled. 



THE SPECTRAL PUBLISHER. 

It seems to me that if I could lay the spectral head 
which comes between me and the paper, I should 
write with a swing and verve that would please the 
reader as much as it would myself. There are sea- 
sons when I cannot write at all ; and then I evoke, 
but in vain, the spectral publisher. He only ap- 
pears when I am in the mood for work. Some- 
times it is one whom I have known ; at others, a 
stranger ; and I see, whichever it be, only a head 
with fixed eyes, and lips apart and formed as if 
about to pronounce that depressing word " No." He 
it is who is responsible for my evasive and pedes- 
trian style. With his eye upon me I halt at every 
sentence and consider what he will say, when I 
ought to be thinking what I have to say. When 
he motions me to be laconic, I become diffuse ; 
when he commands, " Now keep in touch with cur- 
rent times and the general reader," I grow at once 
obscure and wander off into the classics. If he 
chances to look away for a moment, to forget me, I 
recover myself and write with that abandonment I 
so much admire. Then ideas write themselves ; 
images come without effort. Thus is my spectral 
publisher the destroyer of the genius which he seeks 
to discover and introduce to the world. 

But some say the publisher is merely the agent 
of the public ; that he buys what he can sell ; that 
the producer that is, the author must conform 
himself to the market, to the consumer of his wares. 
How this is to be done, and at the same time per- 
mit an author to keep his intellectual integrity and 
develop what is within him, is the problem of litera- 
ture. Plenty there are who seem now and in the 
past td have solved this problem. They glide easily 
into notice with their first book. Is there an astute 
publisher behind them ? Or are they so fortunately 
constituted as to be themselves the counterparts, the 
reflex public, whom they address ? thus quite un- 
consciously gaining the ear and winning the ap- 
plause of their readers. Success thus achieved is 
apt to repeat itself. It is then that the publisher 
and the public often seem more responsible for the 
volumes which follow than the author himself. A 
demand is made upon him temptations from the 
publisher, the expectancy of readers, and under 
this stimulus he goes on to further triumphs, or to 
extinguishment, according to the fertility or poverty 
of his genius. A few successes, often a single one, 
reverse the positions of author and publisher ; the 
author becomes master of the situation, the pub- 
lisher the eager purchaser. It is at this point that 
the author gains his intellectual freedom, if before 
he has not quite dared to exercise it. He can now 
more energetically say what he thinks, and more 
freely give form to his feelings, his experiences, and 
insights. He preaches from a pulpit, declaims from 
the rostrum, espouses reforms, dabbles in philoso- 
phy, art, and criticism. He establishes a sort of 
confessional, for at least one sex, and either covertly 
or boldly absolves the woman with a past.

Is his sense of responsibility at such a point equal 
to his sense of intellectual freedom ? For to him now 
this question must be addressed, and not to the pub- 
lisher, who will print without other thought than 
how many editions may be sold. Is he now at lib- 
erty to controvene the accepted ideas of morality 
and religion, to assume as established the psycholog- 
ical phenomena at present only in the most elemen- 
tary stage of investigation as, for instance, in the 
case of hypnotism ? For I find some readers of re- 
cent fiction take for granted all its hypnotic ma- 
chinery as well-established scientific fact. The wild 
and improbable elements in novels carry their own 
correction, if they chance to need any ; it is not so 
with speculations on religion, socialism, and adven- 
tures into the border lands of spiritism. It is the 
author who is responsible, for the publisher's hand 
is hidden in the mere mercantile transactions which 
accompany publication. 

But to the author struggling for recognition the 
publisher is spectral and formidable, especially to 
those who are doomed to acquire a hearing only af- 
ter a slow and laborious career. Holding fast to 
their own genius and style, they work on in obscur- 
ity for a long time unnoticed, or misunderstood, as 
was the fate of Emerson. But he had to sustain 
himself on an income of about twelve hundred dol- 
lars and infinite patience and faith. His books for 
a long time brought him nothing. How they got 
themselves printed is a mystery. Perhaps publish- 
ers were less spectral and mercenary then than now. 
Mrs. Celia Thaxter, who might be called a fairly 
successful writer, received from her five books an 
income of about a hundred dollars a year. She 
maintained herself chiefly by magazine work, being 
always and everywhere a welcome contributor. 

Mr. E. C. Stedman said, in his admirable ad- 
dress at the recent Stevenson memorial service, that 
" work of the first order cannot remain obscure "; 
and added, "if put forth unheralded it will be 
found out and will make its way." There is no 
doubt of it ; and yet there is a terrible if in the 
way how to get " work of the first order " before 
the public " unheralded." Where to-day is the 
publisher who will venture upon so daring an under- 
taking? For this prophecy of "making its way" 
means time, capital, and, withal, exceeding fine dis- 
cernment and much faith. 

What, then, is to become of those writers who 
have not the gift or the good luck to make a sensa- 
tion at once, yet who have talent of a high order, 
perhaps genius even ? who work slowly, carefully, 
conscientiously ? The question is too difficult ; and 
it seems to be something else than publishers, or 
even readers to any large extent, that help in bring- 
ing forward such writers. It may be said that poets 
and other imaginative writers save each other. 
The best discovers the best and preserves it ; and 
in time, having the sanction of such authority, 
though limited to the few, it attains to wider and 
wider form. But the first requisite namely, how 



to get work of the first order into print remains at 
this time unanswerable. Courage and patience for 
ye, obscure, unacknowledged geniuses. Remember 
Haydon's advice to John Keats : " Do not despair ; 
collect incident, study character, read Shakespeare, 
and trust in Providence." Or read Tennyson's 
" Gleam," where he for the first and only time, un- 
der a thin veil, records all the steps of his own ca- 
reer, and, whatever his impediments, whether snarls 
of critics or indifference of the public, whether self- 
despair, long periods of inactivity, loss of friends, 
and sufferings from without and within, at the 
end of all the experiences of life has but this one 
courageous, inspiring refrain : 

" Follow the Gleam."

THE CLAIMS OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I confess to a good deal of amazement and regret 
upon reading the editorial on " Educational Values " in 
the last number of THE DIAL; not that objection should 
be made to any man's candid expression of preference 
for any class of studies, but that he should think it 
necessary or convincing to use such expressions as 
" husks of science " and the like. If the taste for scien- 
tific study is on the wane, and " hungry souls " are call- 
ing " for more generous and vitalizing forms of nutri- 
tion " to such an extent as the editorial mentioned appears 
to imply, it seems necessary to explain the increased 
facilities everywhere provided for the cultivation of sci- 
ence, and for the increased number of students seeking 
instruction in science. It is unfair in the highest degree 
to say that the advocates of science are the advocates of 
the narrowly practical or " the bread-and-butter policy " 
in education. Such a characterization scarcely applies 
to instruction even in technical schools. If I have ob- 
served the signs of the times to any purpose of late, 
the advocates of a narrow and one-sided policy in edu- 
cation are not the teachers of science. They (the lat- 
ter) are advocating a broad foundation for university 
study, with a large predominance of language ; but they 
are not willing to stand by and see the pursuit of pure 
science, which is as humanistic as that of language itself, 
characterized as a training for the mere purpose of get- 
ting a living. It is well to bear in mind the fact that 
the methods of teaching developed by teachers of sci- 
ence have been adopted by almost if not quite all de- 
partments of study. The powerful influence of science 
upon our pedagogical practice should not be forgotten 
in any estimate of " Educational Values." 

HENRY S. CARHART. 
University of Michigan, April 19, 1895. 

[Twenty-five years ago, the demands of science 
for a larger recognition in educational curricula 
than had hitherto been accorded it were in the main 
just, and we do not begrudge its advocates the suc- 
cess of their efforts. But the claims made, how- 
ever just in themselves, were often urged upon the 
grounds (indefensible from a purely educational

standpoint) of mere practicality, and were usually 
coupled with ill-natured and ignorant attacks upon 
humanistic training. In other words a needed ed- 
ucational reform was urged in a spirit anything but 
commendable, and that spirit has ever since char- 
acterized a large proportion of the discussions of 
the subject by men of science. The intolerance of 
the new scientific education has become every whit 
as bad as the intolerance, which we freely admit, 
of the old humanistic discipline. Nor can we re- 
gard as an unmixed blessing the fact that " the 
methods of teaching developed by teachers of science 
have been adopted by almost if not quite all depart- 
ments of study." In history and literature, in psy- 
chology and the classics, there is now something too 
much, relatively speaking, of the scientific methods 
referred to. The really serious student of science 
undoubtedly gets educational discipline of a high 
character from his work, and scientific work is doubt- 
less undertaken by many students for educational 
rather than for practical reasons ; bilt the Philistine 
attitude toward science and the humanities still pre- 
vails in many quarters, and against it alone were 
directed the remarks to which our correspondent 
takes exception. We are free, however, to add our 
opinion that of late years science has been getting 
from the educators rather more than its due, and 
this at the expense of those pursuits which we be- 
lieve should ever occupy the foremost place in the 
work of shaping to its highest uses the human soul.

THE UTILITY OF AN AUTHORS' GUILD. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with interest the statement of the plans 
and purposes of the American Authors' Guild, as set 
forth by its officers in your last issue; and while I am 
not insensible to the claim which may justly be made 
upon every man by his profession, and am heartily in 
sympathy with many of the objects of the Guild, it 
seems to me that a word of caution or remonstrance 
may be in order as to one phase of the purposes of the 
society. Authors should not expect too much of the 
ability of such an organization to help them practically 
in their relations with publishers. Inexperienced au- 
thors especially will be likely to overestimate the ad- 
vantages to be derived from it in this respect. I could 
scarcely conceive myself, as an author, invoking the aid 
of such a society in a dispute or disagreement with a 
publisher. And I am not without my own bit of experi- 
ence of what such disagreements may be having known 
what it is to be deliberately " bunkoed " by one pub- 
lisher, while treated by another with an unfairness, in 
the handling of one of my books, which resulted in in- 
jury that could scarcely be condoned or repaired. But 
I suppose one must either stand such things, or seek 
whatever of relief and reparation the law may allow. I 
do not see how the sympathy or mutual indignation of 
an Authors' Society could help the matter much. It 
seems to me that such things must be settled, like other 
business affairs, by the individual on his own basis. A 
protective association for looking after the business in- 
terests of authors savors a little too much of " paternal- 
ism " to suit my taste. Besides as a very practical 



consideration may not such a society tend to antago- 
nize publishers as a class, and in this way work a cer- 
tain disadvantage to its members ? May there not be 
seen in it an implication that publishers as a class are 
men who, to put it mildly, will " bear watching " ? and 
is not such an implication one that the many honorable 
members of the publishing trade would naturally be in- 
clined to resent, and thus an antagonism be created be- 
tween publishers and members of the society, which 
might be, to say the least, unfortunate ? This seems 
but human nature. Experience has shown me that this 
matter, like most others in our tangled modern life, is 
not one-sided. If there are dishonest or unfair or blun- 
dering publishers, so there are unreasonable and imprac- 
ticable and pestering authors. Better not, it seems to 
me, array the two classes or crafts against each other as 
natural or necessary adversaries. 

I am aware that much is claimed for the good results 
of the London Authors' Society, of similar character and 
aims ; and it certainly speaks well for it that it includes 
in its membership the foremost living English men of 
letters. But the statement of what has been accom- 
plished by the London society may perhaps be taken 
with some allowance in the absence of anything from 
the publishers' side of the case; and, besides, the con- 
ditions in our new country are widely different from 
those that have long existed in England. My final 
thought is that the American society can be made suc- 
cessful only by including in its membership the leading 
and most influential authors of our country; and this 
the Authors' Guild seems thus far not to have accom- 
plished. A real and representative Society of Authors 
is no doubt a good thing, and such I supposed we had 
in the Authors Club. But a Society of Authors-with-a- 
grievance is a different matter; and this, in my judg- 
ment, is what the American Authors' Guild should strive 
not to become. A WESTERN AUTHOR.

"AMERICAN AUTHORS" ENGLISH. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Since reading the prospectus of the " American Au- 
thors' Guild," in your issue of April 16, 1 have chanced 
to see two pamphlets issued by the Guild, containing 
its latest reports; and a perusal of these astonishing 
publications awakens chiefly a curiosity to know what 
one of the American Authors in the Guild is responsi- 
ble for its literature. I find, for example, that a recent 
report of the Secretary " was read and laid on the table, 
owing to its violation of certain technical rules." An- 
other curious parliamentary proceeding was that a mem- 
ber " was asked to take the chair until the officers could 
be reflected for the remainder of their term. This was 
done." Among the complaints offered was one from a 
member who alleged that " a trade journal had not paid 
him " for an article " accepted by them." Another mem- 
ber related how " a publishing house which had agreed 
to publish his book " had at last been forced to " a ful- 
filment of their contract " with him. Further encour- 
agement was afforded by the reading of " a letter from 
Mrs. A., now in England, who had seen Mr. Besant, and 
that Mr. Besant wished," etc. A member " offered a 
resolution that a pamphlet be prepared, and to have one 
thousand copies printed." It is to be hoped that before 
the new pamphlet appears the American Authors will 
have provided themselves with an editor. Q 4 L, Q,

FAB EASTERN PICTURES AND PROBLEMS.* 



In his " The Peoples and Politics of the Far 
East," Mr. Henry Norman presents the results 
of four years of study, travel, and adventure in 
China, Japan, Korea, Siberia, Malaya, and the 
British, French, Spanish, and Portuguese Ori- 
ental colonies. The book seems to us decidedly 
the best one on the subject since Mr. Curzon's ; 
and we especially commend it to all who have 
been racking their brains of late in the effort to 
extract the rationale of current Eastern ques- 
tions from the newspapers. The ground covered 
by the volume is too extensive and the treatment 
too detailed to admit of anything like a com- 
plete summary of it here ; hence we shall con- 
fine ourselves to those chapters which seem of 
most immediate interest. 

Mr. Norman is at especial pains to set forth 
what he conceives to be the truth about that 
hugely miscalculated factor in international 
problems, the Chinese Empire. Now that the 
bubble blown by Marquis Tseng has been 
pricked by the sword of Japan, and the " sleep- 
ing leviathan of the Orient " has proved to be 
a mere paper dragon with nothing formidable 
about it, it is hard to realize that a year ago 
China ranked as a Great Power, was Kotowed 
to by other Great Powers, and was even in- 
vested by the Western fancy with certain vague 
terrors of her own, boding and mysterious, a 
legacy of the days of Attila and Jenghiz Khan. 
When, at the outbreak of the present war, it 
was announced that each Chinese province was 
called on for a levy of 20,000 men, the illusion 
grew. Nineteen times 20,000 is 380,000 ; and 
the timid reader, aghast at these figures and 
inspired by such political Jeremiahs as Mr. 
Charles Pearson, at once figured to himself a 
host like that of Tamerlane sweeping before it 
the forces of the Mikado like drift before the 
blast, and then (obedient to the prophetic Mr. 
Pearson) rolling westward, swelled by the 
countless hordes of the Yellow Race, to over- 
run the world and bring on a new interregnum 
of barbarism. As usual, the unexpected has 
happened. Huge China, with her 350,000,000 
of people, has been soundly and summarily 
drubbed by little Japan, with her 40,000,000. 

*THE PEOPLES AND POLITICS OF THE FAK EAST : Travels 
and Studies in the British, French, Spanish, and Portuguese 
colonies, Siberia, China, Japan, Korea, Siam, and Malaya.

Illustrations and Maps. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



She has not made even a decent show of re- 
sistance ; and the lurid Pearsonian dream of a 
new Mongol invasion of Europe has vanished 
in thin air. 

Without dwelling on events now familiar to 
the world, it may be interesting to note some of 
the ways in which China has prepared herself 
for defeat. Underlying the more specific causes 
of it are the following general ones : inbred 
and fanatical conservatism and consequent stag- 
nation ; a competitive system which imposes 
proficiency in the Chinese classics as the uni- 
versal standard of fitness for office ; lack of 
racial and territorial unity, there being, says 
Mr. Norman, virtually "no such thing as 
* China' "; organic corruption in the public es- 
tablishments every Chinese official, " with the 
possible exception of one in a thousand," being 
as it were ex officio, " a liar, a thief, and a ty- 
rant." The proximate cause of China's defeat 
by Japan is of course the worthlessness of her 
army. This perhaps hollowest of all the mani- 
fold shams of the Flowery Kingdom is, as both 
Mr. Norman and Mr. Curzon testify, a half- 
organized mob of spiritless, lash-driven coolies 
and uncontrolled savages, armed largely with 
flint-locks, battle-axes, spears, giugals, bows, 
gongs, and the like curio-shop rarities, and offi- 
cered by literati, versed in the lore of Confu- 
cius and the primary official arts of picking and 
stealing, but as ignorant as their men of the 
specific duties of their calling. The army more- 
over is largely a figment. Touching the provin- 
cial levies noted above, Mr. Norman says : 

" The newspaper reader might perhaps not be ex- 
pected to know that the Emperor of China could as 
easily raise 20,000 men in Mars as in some of his prov- 
inces; that it would not be difficult to enlist a consider- 
able force in one part of China to attack another part ; 
that absolutely no organization exists in China for the 
handling of such masses ; that the men would find 
themselves without uniforms, without arms, without 
food, without the most rudimentary knowledge of war, 
without leaders of any description whatever; or that a 
huge army of the kind in the neighborhood of the cap- 
ital would be almost certain to seize the opportunity to 
upset the present alien government." 

Matters are naturally no better in the navy, 
where the same ridiculous standard of fitness 
prevails. The high-grade naval officer need 
not necessarily know a sextant from a cathead, 
or even be capable of boxing the compass ; but 
he must be well up in the classics. He may 
know little or nothing of Kaper or Bowditch, 
but he must know his Confucius. The appoint- 
ment of the renowned Admiral Ting, for in- 
stance, seems to have been made largely on 
grounds which, had the British Government 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



265 



looked to China for naval precedents, would 
have warranted it in putting, say, Professor 
Jowett in command of the Mediterranean 
Squadron. The learned Ting, by-the-bye, is the 
hero of the famous story of the Chinese Ad- 
miral who was found one day playing pitch- 
and-toss, or its Oriental equivalent, on the floor 
of the Admiral's cabin with his sentry. A few 
scattered facts noted here by our author speak 
volumes as to the general condition of the 
Chinese war establishments. 

He says: " I was once being shown by a naval officer 
over one of their two biggest ironclads, which was on a 
cruise at the time, and presumably in first-rate order. 
I noticed a gun carefully protected in a canvas cover. 
As we passed it, I asked casually what it was. The offi- 
cer explained with pride that it was a new quick-firing 
gun, and called a quartermaster to remove the cover- 
ing. The order was obeyed with evident reluctance, 
and when the gun was at length exposed it proved to 
be used by one of the watches as a receptacle for their 
* chow,' and was filled with chop-sticks and littered with 
rice and pickles." 

From a foreign instructor Mr. Norman got a 
few significant facts as to the regime on board 
a Chinese ironclad. In reply to an inquiry 
when his ship would sail, the instructor said : 
" ' The only way we really know when we are to sail 
is by the Admiral coming on board. He leaves the ship 
as soon as we come into port, and we never see him 
again until we sail. He knows nothing at all about 
naval matters he is just the Mandarin put on board 
by Li. ... I have seen him gambling here on the 
quarter-deck with a common seaman, and when he has 
won all his money he '11 tell the paymaster to advance 
him some more, so that he can go on playing. . . . The 
only men on board that could really do anything are 
these young fellows, and they have no power at all. 
They fought against the French and got nothing at all 
for it just a few dollars, and were told to take them- 
selves off. The rings on the big Krupps are beginning 
to open out already, and if there is the least dirt or 
sand you can't shut them.' ' Then I suppose,' I said, 
* that no European Squadron need be afraid of the Pei- 
yang Squadron yet ? ' ' No fear, sir, it is only a ques- 
tion who will get them as prizes,' was the reply." 

Such facts render the " Pall Mall Gazette " 
account of a Chinese warship sailing for the 
Yalu minus one of its guns, which the com- 
mander had pawned, credible enough. A good 
story illustrative of the methods of Chinese 
officialdom dates back to the French war : 

" While the French fleet was off Tamsui, the 27-centi- 
metre Krupp guns in one of the shore batteries had 
been trained upon the Gallisoniere at 1,000 yards range 
for several days. At the first French shot all the 
Chinese artillerymen fled, except one, who succeeded in 
discharging three guns before a shot struck him and 
blew his head off. One of the shells he fired pierced 
the ship and remained imbedded in the woodwork, fail- 
ing to explode. The vessel went to Hongkong, where 
with infinite precautions the shell was removed and 
opened. It had been manufactured at the Foochow 



Arsenel, and contained charcoal ! The maker had, 
of course, been paid for gunpowder and had pocketed 
the difference." 

" The more one learns about China," says 
Mr. Norman, " the less confident become one's 
opinions about it " the first result of experi- 
ence being to teach that any sweeping general- 
ization about the country is almost necessarily 
untrue. To the Western mind every individ- 
ual Chinamen seems a mass of contradictions. 
His ways are not our ways, and his motives are 
not our motives ; and the moment we attempt 
to explain him and account for his conduct on 
purely Western theories we are at sea. Take, 
for example, the difference of views upon a 
single point human life. Mr. Norman relates 
that a foreign resident of Peking riding through 
the streets one day came upon a crowd of natives. 
Drawing near, he found them passively watch- 
ing a man who was trying to commit suicide 
by beating his head against a wall. Inquiry 
disclosed the fact that the man was a coolie 
who, claiming that his wages for a certain job 
were short by ten cash (about two cents), was 
proceeding to revenge himself on his employer 
by dashing out his own brains. Another in- 
stance is told of a man who, on a like provoca- 
tion, threw himself into a canal, but (mirabile 
dictu) was pulled out by the bystanders. " So 
he simply sat down on the edge and starved 
himself to death, to be revenged against some- 
body who had cheated him." Lest these stories 
be lightly ascribed to what Dr. Johnson called 
" the desire to propagate a wonder " on Mr. 
Norman's part, we subjoin a parallel case, the 
facts of which are taken from a Chinese news- 
paper. It appears that one day a sow belong- 
ing to a Mrs. Feng happening to knock down 
and deface the front door of a Mrs. Wang, the 
latter presented a claim upon her neighbor for 
damages. Mrs. Feng, disowning legal respon- 
sibility in the premises, declined payment ; 
whereupon a fierce debate ensued, which ended 
in the injured Mrs. Wang's threatening to take 
the life not of Mrs. Feng or of the original 
trespasser but of herself ! But herein she 
reckoned without her host ; for Mrs. Feng, ap- 
prised in time of her danger, and being a per- 
son of resource and promptitude, at once turned 
the tables on her enemy by herself jumping into 
the canal, whence she was dragged the day fol- 
lowing, to the signal discomfiture of Mrs. 
Wang. Perhaps the Ghost Theory may be 
called in to explain these Oriental notions of 
vengeance. 

There is one point upon which, as Mr. Nor- 



266 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



man testifies, all Chiiiamen are perfectly con- 
sistent with themselves and with each other ; 
and that is, hatred of the foreigner. Hatred, 
however, is not just the word here, for it im- 
plies a tincture of respect ; whereas in China 
the "foreign devil" is despised at sight not 
merely disliked, but regarded with sincere and 
profound contempt. To the apprehension of 
the rabble, he is an unclean and possibly a 
dangerous animal, to be baited and disposed of 
out of hand, like a rat ; while as for the rulers, 
says Mr. Norman, " the better they know us 
the less they like us." Said a foreign diplomat 
at Peking : "If the Tsungli Yamen (Foreign 
Board) were abolished our lives would not be 
safe here twenty-four hours. The people just 
refrain from actually molesting us because they 
have learned that they will be very severely pun- 
ished if they do." To show what the Celestial 
really thinks of foreigners, there is nothing like 
a ramble in Peking. 

" What are your relations with the people you meet ? 
First of all, they crowd around you whenever you stop, 
and in a minute you are the centre of a solid mass of 
humanity, which is eating horrible stuff, which is cov- 
ered with vermin, which smells worse than words can 
tell, and which is quite likely to have the small-pox 
about it. ... The crowd jostles you, feels your clothes 
with its dirty hands, pokes its nose in your face, keep- 
ing up all the time a string of insulting and obscene 
remarks, with accompanying roars of laughter. . . . 
The pedestrian you meet treats you with much less con- 
sideration than one of his own countrymen; the children 
run to the door to cry Kueidzu! ' devil at you. They 
have other indescribable and worse ways of insulting 
you. . . ." 

These street-amenities are, of course, by no 
means confined to Peking or the mob. Says a 
member of the China Inland Mission (1894) : 
" The Chi-nan-f u fop, dressed in silks and satins, flip- 
ping his sleeves in the face of the foreign visitor met 
in the street; the middle-aged scholar, dressed as a 
gentleman, not thinking it beneath him to hiss out ' for- 
eign devil 'or simply ' devil '; young and old spitting 
on the ground in bitterness close to the visitor's feet, 
laughing in his face, or, on passing, turning sharply 
round and making a most hateful noise at his ear, 
these are some of the petty annoyances that the literati 
and gentry practise." 

The discussion of the relation between Chi- 
nese and foreigners naturally leads up to the 
vexed Missionary Question, a point on which 
Mr. Norman holds very strong opinions. 

" I believe it to be strictly within the limits of truth 
to say that foreign missionary effort in China has been 
productive of far more harm than good. Instead of 
serving as a link between Chinese and foreigners, the 
missionaries have formed a growing obstacle. As trav- 
ellers in the East well know, Oriental peoples are es- 
pecially susceptible upon two points, of which their re- 
ligion is the chief. We have forced the inculcation of 



an alien and a detested creed upon the Chinese literally 
at the point of the bayonet. ... I am convinced that 
if the subscribers to Chinese missions could only see for 
themselves the minute results of good and the consid- 
erable results of harm that their money produces, they 
would find in the vast opportunities for reformatory 
work at home a more attractive field for their charity." 

In support of these views the author cites 
the testimony of some of the leading mission- 
aries themselves, Romish and Protestant ; and 
we may observe en passant that the Roman 
propaganda, being the more consistently and 
devotedly served, and not being discredited in 
the eyes of the natives by multiplicity of sects, 
is the more successful of the two. Says Mr. 
Norman : 

" I once asked a Roman Catholic priest whom I met 
in China, and of whose knowledge and character I had 
formed the highest opinion, if he believed that the result 
of missionary enterprise would result, even in the ful- 
ness of time, in anything that could be remotely de- 
scribed as the Christianizing of China. 'Jamais!' he 
replied emphatically. ' Then,' said I, ' why are you 
here ? ' '1 am here,' he replied, ' simply in obedience 
to the command to preach the Gospel to all peoples. 
Like the soldiers in the ranks, I obey the orders of my 
commander, without understanding in the least what 
good is to come of them." 

Several Protestant witnesses are cited to the 
like effect ; the main conclusion being that, in 
the words of Dr. A. Williamson, " not only is 
heathenism extending, but immorality " (the 
sole point in which the Chinese seem eager to 
learn of the foreign devil) " is increasing in 
all directions." The Chinese themselves in- 
cline to bracket missionaries and opium to- 
gether as the twin curses of their country ; while 
" conversion " to Christianity is regarded by 
many natives merely as a possible step to an 
easier livelihood. Mr. Norman tells of a friend 
of his who asked a Chinese servant, whom he 
had previously known, what he was engaged in 
doing. He replied, " My have got that Jesus 
pidgin." He simply meant that he had taken 
up Christianity, with its substantial benefits in 
the way of board and wages, as his new calling. 

The main drift of the sections of Mr. Nor- 
man's book to which we have confined our- 
selves seems to be that, in the words of Mr. 
Kipling, " East is East, and West is West.'* 
Orientals and Westerns are the oil and the 
water of humanity ; and there is, so far as we 
can see, no way of blending them. China is 
inspired by this truth when she denounces 
Westernizing Japan as a traitor to Asia ; Japan 
is inspired by it when she retorts that China 
is the real traitor, since, instead of rousing her- 
self to resist the tide of Occidental advance,

sleep of Confucian barbarism even while the 
enemy is knocking at her gates. And Japan, 
says Mr. Norman, " is prepared to bring China 
back to Asiatic allegiance." Her watchword 
is " Asia for the Asiatics "; a federation or 
Bund of Eastern powers, with the hegemony 
for herself, is her political goal. Obviously, 
to the support of such an arrangement as this, 
an alliance with a European State is necessary ; 
and Great Britain is Japan's first choice. 

" Great Britain and Japan allied in the Far East 
would be irresistible. The one would command the 
sea, the other would dominate the land. . . . With 
such a union the Korean Channel would become a sec- 
ond Dardanelles, and the Sea of Japan would become 
the Russian Black Sea of the East." 

Meanwhile (be it added), tireless Kussia is 
pushing on her Trans-Siberian Railway, not, 
as Mr. Norman himself admits, to a terminus 
at icebound Vladivostock, but to a Korean port. 
" Whatever else may be thought of the Far 
East, let the fact that Russia intends to go to 
Korea be regarded as certain." All things con- 
sidered, it would seem that a storm is brewing 
in the Orient compared with which the one just 
spent will be but a passing squall. We heartily 
commend Mr. Norman's book as a rich and sug- 
gestive descriptive, expository, and pictorial 
aid to a comprehension of the Far East, its 
peoples and its problems.

PROFESSOR TYRRELL, ON IIATIX POETRY.* 

The Turnbull Lectureship had a propitious 
inauguration. American literature has pro- 
duced no work more helpful and suggestive to 
one who wishes to cultivate the power to appre- 
ciate verse than Mr. Stedman's lectures on 
" The Nature and Elements of Poetry," which 
formed the first series on the Turnbull founda- 
tion. This was followed, in 1892, by a con- 
sideration of " The Growth and Influence of 
Classical Greek Poetry," by no less an authority 
than Professor Jebb, of Cambridge. Latin 
Poetry naturally came in for its hearing next ; 
and the lecturer chosen was Professor Tyrrell, 
of Dublin, a Professor of Greek, by the way, 
though best known in this country, perhaps, by 
his work in editing the Correspondence of 
Cicero. It will be seen that his credentials for 
such a position as that of the Turnbull lecture- 
ship, with Latin Poetry as the special subject, 

* LATIN POETRY. Lectures delivered on the Percy Turn- 
bull Memorial Foundation in the Johns Hopkins University. 
By R. Y. Tyrrell, Regius Professor of Greek in the Univer- 
sity of Dublin. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



are not, on their face, so unquestionable as 
those of either of his predecessors ; and a read- 
ing of the lectures, as they now appear in book 
form, will be found slightly disappointing to 
those whose expectations are based upon the 
standard set by Mr. Stedman and Professor 
Jebb. 

One is scarcely influenced to follow Professor 
Tyrrell very implicitly in matters of opinion, 
when he meets, in the introductory chapter, a 
serious attempt to establish Cicero in high rank 
among the Roman bards. In his judgment, of 
all the poets of the Ca3sarean period, Lucretius 
and Catullus excepted, " by far the most im- 
portant and interesting, not only for his real 
poetic ability, but for the influence which he 
exercised upon subsequent Art, is the great 
orator and consummate man of letters, M. Tul- 
lius Cicero." Several pages are devoted to 
the maintenance of this thesis ; but the proof 
adduced does not compel assent. Cicero was 
a man of great versatility, but his achievements 
in poetry may perhaps more fitly be classed 
along with his military victory over the Pin- 
denissitae than made the basis for ranking him 
as a third after such poets as Lucretius and 
Catullus. 

As the lecturer is over-charitable toward the 
pretensions of Cicero as a poet, so, on the other 
hand, he seems unduly adverse in his treatment 
of Horace. Horace may have adapted much 
from Lucilius, but the evidence of the Lucilian 
fragments seems rather overworked in the ef- 
fort to prove that his writings are not " the 
artless and candid expression of his personal 
feelings and experiences." It is easier to be- 
lieve that a poet may occasionally set the " can- 
did expression of his personal feelings and ex- 
periences " in a framework borrowed, in greater 
or less degree, from the literature of a previous 
age, than to believe that any considerable por- 
tion of the verse of Horace is a mere literary 
exercise in the modernization of Lucilius. Pro- 
fessor Tyrrell has not been untouched, how- 
ever, by the charm of the Odes : " Whatever 
may be thought about the meaning which un- 
derlies them, their form is perfection itself, and 
they defy imitation. . . . Each new attempt 
to copy them has only added a new proof that 
the mould in which they were made was shat- 
tered beyond all mending when it fell from the 
hands of Horace." 

The two lectures in which Lucretius and 
Catullus are considered show a more ardent 
enthusiasm than any other portion of the series, 
and the added zest shown in their delivery made 



268

[May 1, 



an impression upon at least one listener which 
two years have not effaced. Lucretius is to him 
" this High Priest of Atheism, this Apostle of 
Irreligion, who thunders against inspiration like 
one inspired, and who shows all the rapt devotion 
of a Stephen in his denial of immortality, all 
the fervor of a Bossuet while he scatters to the 
winds the last perished leaves of human hope." 
His poem is kept " instinct with life," notwith- 
standing the deadness of the philosophy which 
it embodies, by " the fine frenzy which clothes 
every argument, however dry or abstruse, with 
all the hues of fancy, and which makes the poem 
like nothing else in all literature, if we except 
our own Tennyson's ' Two Voices.' " Again : 
" He breathed upon the system of Epicurus, 
and created a soul under the ribs of death." 
As one may see from these short quotations, 
the Dublin professor has found the " fine 
frenzy " of his subject contagious, and the re- 
sult is a lecture which will be read with intense 
interest, and by the general reader, too, as well 
as the student of Latin literature. Lucretius, 
he concludes, " has now won his place among 
the great poets of the world. . . . We now 
see how religious is the irreligion of this Titan. 
We hear in his sombre strains not the sneers 
of the encyclopaedist, but the high words of 
Prometheus on the Caucasus. At last the 
world has learned that intrepid audacity com- 
bined with noble sincerity may have a beauty 
which is like the beauty of holiness. . . . And 
we see in him an eager student of Nature, who 
has been raised by a naturally religious cast of 
mind, through cold and intangible abstractions 
to which he tried in vain to cling, raised out 
of Nature and up to Nature's God." 

Passing from the great philosopher, in Catul- 
lus we meet one " the keynote of whose song is 
man and man's heart," one tormented not " by 
the painful riddle of the earth," as Lucretius, 
but " by the pangs of disprized love." In the 
poems of which Lesbia is the subject, Professor 
Tyrrell thinks that the poet " has struck those 
terrible chords which give us the very vibrations 
of his heart, chords as true as those of Burns 
or Shakespeare, and as artistic as those of Keats 
or Shelley." (One pauses here to note the ad- 
mission that one poet, at least, struck " true 
chords," notwithstanding the habit of adapta- 
tion from his predecessors, whether Horace 
could do so or not.) The usual comparison of 
Catullus with Moore is rejected, and is held to 
have injured the work of translators, who have 
missed the deep feeling of the original and 
fallen into " the rollicking vein of the Irish 



melodist." The opinion of Professor Sellar 
is quoted with approval, that the " Attis," "re- 
garded as a work of pure imagination, is the 
most remarkable poetical creation in the Latin 
language." 

Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid are passed 
over hastily at the close of the lecture on Ca- 
tullus. Of the three, Propertius stands first 
in the sympathy of the author ; and when we 
leave him, we are told, " we abandon really 
ardent sincerity in the expression of the pas- 
sion of love, never again to meet it in Latin 
poetry." If the lecture on Virgil seems some- 
what less interesting than the two which pre- 
cede, it is not from any lack of sympathetic 
treatment, but from the impossibility of work- 
ing into an hour's talk on the author of the 
^Eneid any considerable amount of matter not 
already known to the average reader. The 
lecture on Horace has been mentioned above. 
The space already taken forbids more than the 
mere mention of the two remaining, which 
treat respectively of " Latin Satire " and the 
" Latin Poetry of the Decline." 

To the lectures as delivered is appended an 
essay of some twenty-five pages on " Some Re- 
cent Translations of Virgil." We have noted 
but two misprints Fabukmus for Fabulinus, 
page 63 ; and another on page 297, which has 
a quite comical effect, since it makes the pious 
.ZEneas float, instead of flout, " Dido's realm 
as he flies." 

One will not find in these lectures a substi- 
tute for the three excellent volumes of the late 
Professor Sellar ; but for a general view of 
Latin poetry, within the compass of a single 
volume, we know of nothing better. By the 
time the poetry of the leading literary races has 
been treated in this way, the Turnbull lecture- 
ship will have done a great service to the Amer- 
ican people in cultivating the power to enjoy 
and understand good poetry. In 1894, Pro- 
fessor Norton was the lecturer, with Dante as 
his theme ; and no doubt his lectures will be 
published ere long. For some reason or other, 
the lectureship was not filled for 1895. Hebrew 
Poetry is announced as the subject for 1896, 
to be considered by Professor George A. Smith, 
of Glasgow. w. H. JOHNSON.

LIVES OF THE PRESIDENTS.* 



He who would read the history of American 
politics in the lives of our great men turns nat- 
urally to the roll of Presidents. General Wil- 
son, the editor of the large and handsome vol- 
ume entitled " The Presidents of the United 
States," states that the twenty-three biographies 
which it contains present a complete record of 
the most important events in the nation's his- 
tory, from the inauguration of our first presi- 
dent to the summer of 1894. Many of the 
articles in the book were prepared for the 
" Cyclopaedia of American Biography," while a 
few were written especially for this work. Al- 
though the sketches are necessarily short, they 
are not lacking in value or in interest. A series 
of political biographies by such writers as 
Messrs. Robert C. Winthrop, John Fiske, 
James Parton, D. C. Gilman, John Hay, and 
others scarcely less known, could hardly fail to 
be noteworthy. The limitations of the work 
were such that the writers were confined for 
the most part to a recital of facts already fa- 
miliar to the average student of American his- 
tory ; yet the stories are so well told that no 
one will regret the time spent in reading them 
in this new form. The book is not only a col- 
lection of interesting biographies, but is also a 
compendium of the history of America under 
constitutional government. 

Such a work as this cannot fail to appeal to 
the pride of patriotic Americans. With all 
our political faults, it is still true that no other 
country in the world can boast of such a suc- 
cession of able rulers. In the whole list there 
are few weak and no unworthy men, while some 
will rank among the world's greatest leaders. 
An eminent English historian has recently said 
that the place of Washington in the history of 
mankind "is well-nigh without a fellow." After 
the death of Mr. Lincoln, the London " Spec- 
tator " spoke of him as " certainly the best, if 
not the ablest, man ruling over any country in 
the civilized world "; and Professor Gold win 
Smith said, " America has gained one more 
ideal character, the most precious and inspir- 
ing of national possessions." 

In view of his later life, it seems strange, at 
first, to find Jefferson Davis, in his article re- 
printed from the " Cyclopedia of Biography," 

*THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1789-1894. 
By John Fiske, Carl Schurz, William E. Russell, Daniel C. 
Gilman, William Walter Phelps, Robert C. Winthrop, George 
Bancroft, John Hay, and others. Edited by James Grant 
Wilson. With Steel Portraits, Facsimile Letters, and other 
Illustrations. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



writing fairly and appreciatively of so sturdy a 
patriot and so stanch a Union man as Zachary 
Taylor. Yet Mr. Davis could speak with author- 
ity, for he was a member of General Taylor's 
staff during the Mexican war, and was his 
trusted friend. He speaks guardedly of Tay- 
lor's political opinions, but evidently admired 
his patriotism. He even goes so far as to state 
his belief that if Taylor had lived he would 
have done much to abate the party and sec- 
tional bitterness which became so much intensi- 
fied in the years just succeeding his death. 

The book is illustrated with excellent steel 
engravings of the Presidents, made from noted 
portraits. Each sketch closes with a short 
bibliography, and the editor has appended 
sketches of the " ladies of the White House," 
together with notices of such descendants of the 
Presidents as have become prominent in the 
subsequent history of the country. Whatever 
may be said of the Presidents, it is certain that 
very few, if any, commonplace women have been 
numbered in the list of their wives ; and not the 
least interesting chapter in the nation's history 
is that relating to their participation in its social 
and political life. The names of Martha Wash- 
ington and Abigail Adams are familiar ones, 
but the beautiful and accomplished Martha Jef- 
ferson seems to have received rather less than 
her due from posterity. It is interesting to read 
that Mr. Jefferson " retained a romantic devo- 
tion for her throughout his life, and because of 
her failing health refused foreign appointments 
in 1776, and again in 1781, having promised 
that he would accept no public office that would 
involve their separation." 

Mrs. Polk was a woman of unusual strength 
of character, and was one of the most popular 
of the ladies who have presided at the White 
House. u She held weekly receptions, and abol- 
ished the custom of giving refreshments to the 
guests. She also forbade dancing, as out of 
keeping with the character of such entertain- 
ments. In spite of her reforms, Mrs. Polk was 
very popular. ' Madam,' said a prominent 
South Carolinian, at one of her receptions, 
' there is a woe pronounced against you in the 
Bible.' On her inquiring his meaning, he 
added : ' The Bible says, " Woe unto you when 
all men shall speak well of you." ' 

Mrs. Taylor was of a different cast of mind. 
When General Taylor became President " she 
reluctantly accepted her responsibilities, re- 
garding the office as a plot to deprive her of 
her husband's society and to shorten his life by 
unnecessary care. She surrendered to her

youngest daughter the superintendence of the

The lives of the later Presidents' wives are 
enshrined in the hearts of the American peo- 
ple. Each one has been of the noblest type of 
womanhood, and, both in character and accom- 
plishment, is worthy of the title of " the first

RECENT FICTION.* 



The fact is perhaps worth noting that of the fif- 
teen books of fiction grouped for the purposes of 
the present article, and representing what is best in 
the output of the past few months, four should have 
been written by Chicagoans. One swallow does not 
make a summer, and four novels do not make what 
the journalist calls a " literary centre," but there is 
at least an encouraging indication of progress in 
this almost simultaneous appearance of four exam- 
ples of skilful and conscientious workmanship. For, 
whatever their shortcomings, the four books alike 
are possessed of those qualities ; they display, more- 
over, a feeling for literature as an art, which is a 
very different thing from literature as " journalism," 
for example, or from literature that claims the name 
by mere virtue of the intrinsic human interest of 
its subject-matter. 

First of all, we will say a few words of Miss 
Bell's " A Little Sister to the Wilderness." In this 
book, the reader will find little to remind him of

group of social silhouettes with which the author 
made her debut a couple of years ago. Here we 
have, not the sophisticated society of the cities, but 
the primitive society of the Tennessee mountain 
regions. The ground is peculiarly Miss Murfree's, 
but we think that Miss Bell has justified her right 
to join in the occupation. Description and charac- 
terization are both good, and the spiritual issues of 
the situation are drawn out with a fine sense of rela- 
tive values. The dialect is something of a stumb- 
ling block, but the writer has a conscience (as her 
prefatory note upon this subject shows), and it 
would hardly be reasonable to expect phonetics of 
more standard type from her mountaineers. Of 
the two central figures, that of the heroine, felici- 
tously described as a '' soul-endogen," is the more 
finely conceived, and arouses the instant sympathies 
of the reader. The other figure, that of the itiner- 
ant revivalist, we can hardly take as seriously as the 
writer would have us. The essential vulgarity of 
the whole theory of religious practice and inculca- 
tion which he exemplifies stands in the way. A man 
as fine as the writer would have us think her hero 
would be the last in the world to lend himself to 
such proceedings. Mr. Bunner, in one of his short 
stories, has depicted for us the revivalist and his 
methods with the better art and saner view. But 
for all that, Miss Bell has told a story that deserves 
attention, and the sincerity of her workmanship is 
undoubted. For this, one may easily pardon some 
careless phrases, a few defective articulations, and 
the undue exaltation of a type of character that can- 
not be called admirable. 

" A Sawdust Doll " does not seem to us the hap- 
piest of titles for the story in which Mrs. de Koven 
has outlined the supreme tragic experience of a wo- 
man's life. The nursery anecdote suggested by the 
words brings with it associations that are merely 
amusing, and irony is carried far indeed when we 
liken the petty disillusionment of a child to the 
final awakening from that dream of happiness which 
comes but once in a life. Mrs. de Koven's story 
is of the simplest in construction. Fiction has no 
more familiar figure than that of the woman who 
fondly believes that friendship and respect can ade- 
quately fill the place of love in her heart, and whose 
wedded life is tranquil for a time with the calm 
that precedes the storm. When passion comes into 
such a life, it is with the force of the freshet, and 
devastation marks its path. But this new variation 
upon so common a theme has both force and distinc- 
tion. The force is in the woman's struggle for 
self-mastery, eventually at bitter cost attained ; the 
distinction is in the artistic restraint of the work, 
and the elaboration of a style that will, for the 
most part, bear close examination. We say for the 
most part, because there are now and then touches 
of the stiff and dithyrambic, notes that strike the 
ear as a trifle discordant, and such infelicitous fig- 
ures as " Lightning will breed an infidelity in a 
compass." Mrs. de Koven has set herself so exact-

ing a standard of form that we must speak of these 
matters, but mainly for the sake of adding that 
their mention is a tribute to the high plane of ex- 
cellence that alone makes them noticeable. With 
the ordinary novel such things are a matter of 
course, but this novel is one of exceptionally con- 
scientious workmanship. The precision and per- 
spicuity of the style are French rather than English, 
and its defects, if we may hazard an opinion upon 
so delicate a subject, seem to result from the fact 
that the extremely modern group of Frenchmen 
have unduly influenced the writer. Externally, 
" A Sawdust Doll " is a story of New York and 
Newport society, which the author knows and does 
not take too seriously. The mechanical features of 
the book are so tasteful that its careless proof-read- 
ing is all the more a blemish. . 

" I wonder how those clever fellows who write 
books turn out epigrams. Do they flow out ready 
made, or are they worked out with a dictionary ? " 
This is one of the things that puzzle the " fool " 
who is the hero of Mr. Chatfield-Taylor's latest 
novel, but it is clearly no puzzle to the author, for 
a thick sheaf of epigrams makes up almost the en- 
tire contents of his book. We will not hazard a 
conjecture as to their genesis: some of them are 
platitudinous enough to "flow out ready made " from 
any kind of a pen ; others are so neatly turned as 
to suggest, not necessarily the dictionary which 
would prove a dubious aid in such a case but 
rather a considerable acuteness of social observa- 
tion, or at least a careful study of recent French 
and English writing of the meteor-studded type. 
But we should say that the author had not been 
well-advised in abandoning the pleasant narrative 
style of " An American Peeress " to venture upon 
new ground so dangerous. For your epigram must 
be very good indeed to be tolerable, and must spring 
from a certain breadth of view and ripeness of ex- 
perience rarely if ever possessed by young writers. 
The story told (mostly in the epigrammatic mus- 
ings of its hero) by Mr. Chatfield-Taylor is of the 
slightest description. There is no doubt that the 
hero is a fool, as he himself frankly admits, for no 
one deserving a less contemptuous title could so long 
have hesitated between the two women the pure 
one and the impure who flit across the pages of 
the book, and through the reveries of the young ar- 
tist who loves them both without being able to de- 
termine which of his two passions is the real thing. 
He is enlightened in the end, but does not deserve 
the good fortune that seemingly awaits him, and we 
trust that Dorothy gives him more than one bad 
quarter of an hour before she accepts his sullied 
devotion. 

Not long ago, in commenting upon Mr. Paul Lei- 
cester Ford's strong novel of New York politics, we 
ventured the prediction that the political motive, 
being peculiarly available for the purposes of the 
American novelist, would come to play an import- 
ant part in our fiction. In Mr. Harry Perry Rob- 



inson's " Men Born Equal " we have an impressive 
presentation of one of the most urgent of all our 
political problems that offered by the ignorant and 
hot-headed democracy of our large cities, who, in 
the first flush of their newly-realized power, allow- 
ing themselves to be controlled by the self-seeking 
and unscrupulous demagogue, make " labor " their 
shibboleth, and in its name assail the very founda- 
tions of civilized society. This problem Mr. Rob- 
inson presents with knowledge and sympathy 
knowledge of the actual workings of municipal ma- 
chines and the tactics of labor organizations, sym- 
pathy with the dull sense of wrong that impels to 
the senseless antagonisms and riots that spring from 
the present hostility between employers and em- 
ployed. The situation selected by the author is 
presented with force and fairness, and the aspira- 
tions of his hero must be those of every intelligent 
and unprejudiced observer of the industrial situa- 
tion. The painful reality of the details that make 
up this story is only too evident to the inhabitants 
of our large cities, and we must feel with the writer 
that no specific and immediate remedy is possible. 
The uplifting forces of a widened education and a 
deepened moral sense will in the end win the fight 
for civilization, as against the anarchy now threat- 
ened ; but we must be patient, and not hope to re- 
construct the world in a day. Mr. Robinson is at 
times too didactic for the ends of good literary art, 
but he enlists the feelings of the earnest reader, 
and offers him not only a political tract, but an at- 
tractive love-story as well ; the whole being framed 
in forcible, nervous, and unpretentious English. It 
is distinctly a good book, written from life, homely 
in its sincerity, and faithful to fine ideals through- 
out. 

An English visitor to our shores recently ex- 
pressed the opinion that American labor organiza- 
tions seemed still to be in a stage long outgrown 
and left behind by the trades unions of Great Brit- 
ain. He found here the violence and the lawless- 
ness that the sober second thought of the English 
workingmen rejected many years ago, as inflicting 
the deepest of injuries upon the cause of the indus- 
trial masses. A comparative study of present-day 
strikes in the two countries, and of the coercive 
methods of labor organizations, would, we think, 
afford much justification for this view. Such, evi- 
dently, is the opinion of Mrs. Foote, whose " Cceur 
d'Alene," although a sketch rather than a detailed 
picture, strongly reminds us of Charles Reade's 
" Put Yourself in His Place," as far as the two 
books stand upon the common ground of the dis- 
cussion of union versus non-union labor. A strike 
of Montana miners in the summer of 1892 is the 
subject of Mrs. Foote's story, and her evident fa- 
miliarity with the scenes and types of character de- 
picted gives strength to a work that is yet open to 
the criticism of being done too much in outline. 
Interest of the tenderer sort is supplied by a love- 
story, while the perils of hero and heroine keep the

interest fresh and the attention alert. That the book 
is an example of good, forcible, picturesque writ- 
ing, need hardly be added to our comment. The 
author's name always stands for these qualities, and 
others no less admirable. 

We have read with much interest the three or 
four volumes of fiction produced by Mrs. Van Rens- 
selaer Cruger during the past few years, hoping to 
observe a steady development of the talent undeni- 
ably latent in her first book. The hope has not 
been realized to any considerable extent, although 
an increasing firmness of grasp may be recognized 
in the more recent books, as well as the ability to 
fill a larger canvas. " Poppsea," Mrs. Cruger's new 
novel, is the most ambitious work yet attempted by 
her, and may be regarded as equal in achievement 
to any of its predecessors, while upon a scale so 
much larger as to make even this measure of suc- 
cess creditable. But we cannot help noting the 
lingering traces of amateurishness that keep the book 
well down in the ranks, and the lapses from good 
and even from grammatical English that too fre- 
quently occur. Such an anti-climax, the consequence 
of a solecism, as this for example : " Emotion must 
be the keynote of her life, Now, if it were me ' 
is unpardonable. There is in this book less, per- 
haps, of " Julien Gordon's " old tendency to assume 
that the life of "society" in the narrow sense is any 
considerable part of the life of humanity or is pos- 
sessed of any broad human interest ; but, per contra, 
there seems to be an increasing tendency to employ 
the cheap device best exemplified by " Ouida"- 
of sprinkling the pages with unfamiliar proper 
names and would-be recondite allusions. Mrs. Cru- 
ger becomes at times quite as airy in this respect as 
her prototype. As for Poppaea's conduct, we must 
leave that for the moralist to characterize ; but there 
is one scene at which the gorge must rise, even of 
those who are not moralists by profession. Even 
Poppsea's life stands for certain ideals of conduct, 
albeit neither very lofty nor very wholesome ; and 
the scene in question is so vulgar and tawdry a dero- 
gation from these ideals that others than prudes may 
well find in it some cause for offence. 

The Woman Question looms ominously in the 
forefront of Mrs. Burton Harrison's latest novel, 
and casts its shadow over the narrative. The " bach- 
elor maid " of the story is a common enough figure 
in these days, and the author has limned the type 
with her habitual grace and penetration. Further- 
more, her heroine is made to learn the lesson that 
awaits all "bachelor maids" sooner or later, the 
lesson that a life of the affections is not incompat- 
ible with devotion to the purest intellectual ideals 
the lesson, rather, that the one is the needed com- 
plement of the other. In its tenor and outcome the 
work is no less sweet and wholesome than Mrs. 
Harrison's earlier books ; yet it is made a compar- 
ative failure by the forced note of didacticism and 
by the frequent discussions that contribute anything 
but enlivenment to its pages. 



Another phase of the Woman Question, which is 
in this case the Man Question also, occupies the at- 
tention of Mrs. Deland in her story of " Philip and 
His Wife." Divorce, as it presents itself to variously 
constituted minds, is the theme from which we never 
escape to any great distance while engaged with 
these pages. The discussion is not very conclusive, 
and the sympathies of readers will not always fol- 
low the author's lead, but the intensity of feeling 
brought to bear upon this grave social problem 
commands respect and makes a deep impression. 
Nor does absorption in an ethical discussion deny 
to Mrs. Deland's work some measure of palpitating 
life at least as far as several of the characters are 
concerned. As for the hero, we are bound to give 
him the harsh name of a spiritual prig, and it is dif- 
ficult to feel for him much sympathy in his self- 
evolved anguish of soul. For the rest, Mrs. Deland 
depicts for us New England village life with accu- 
racy, discernment, and some slight sense of humor. 
" Mon verre n'est pas grand, mais je bois dans mons 
verre " may fairly be said by her of her work con- 
sidered in its non-didactic aspects. 

The fine art of padding is by no means a new one, 
and we have frequently had occasion to name Mr. 
Crawford as among the novelists most accomplished 
in its practice. But Mr. Crawford has surpassed 
even himself in " The Ralstons," a two-volume con- 
tinuation of " Katherine Lauderdale," and the most 
emulous of his successors will not find it easy to tell 
so simple a story at so great a length. We do not 
say so wearisome a length, for Mr. Crawford's writ- 
ing, however irrelevant to the situation, and how- 
ever calculated to make the reader impatient, is al- 
ways possessed of high literary finish, and flows so 
smoothly on that one absorbs it with no sense of 
effort, just as one breathes without consciousness of 
the act. So the various Ralstons and Lauderdales 
of his story carry on their interminable conversa- 
tions, and the author varies their words with his 
own equally interminable comment, and we bide 
our time, knowing that a few things must happen 
somewhere in the course of the two volumes. Re- 
duced to its lowest terms, the novel is a very simple 
presentation of some very hackneyed material 
the consequences of a secret marriage and a contest 
for the immense fortune left by a man who amused 
himself by making many wills. Further develop- 
ments are promised us by the novelist, and, indeed, 
there is in the nature of things no reason why the 
story of this little family group should not go on 
indefinitely, even to the extent of rivalling the pro- 
ductions of Mademoiselle de Scuddry herself. 

Japan is not wholly a new field for the interna- 
tional novel, but its possibilities are far from ex- 
hausted, and Mr. John Luther Long, the latest 
writer to exploit its opportunities, must be credited 
with a distinct success. Both in setting and in char- 
acterization, " Miss Cherry-Blossom of Tokyo " of- 
fers convincing evidence of intimate acquaintance 
with its subject. The Japanese heroine has been,

to be sure, a little sophisticated by a term of resi- 
dence in America, at the " Bryn Mawr gakko," but 
the author sees better than most observers that the 
oriental offers no exception to the rule of cesium, 
non animum mutant. We are too apt to think 
that the subjects of the Mikado, by contact with 
things European, have really become occidentalized 
at heart Mr. Long helps us to learn the lesson that 
their inner life remains all but wholly impenetrable 
to our barbarian gaze, just as we have learned a 
similar lesson from Mr. Kipling concerning the na- 
tives of British India. Some concessions, indeed, 
he is forced to make to the exigencies of the love- 
story which it was his main purpose to tell, and as 
far as it has charm for us in this respect, we must 
admit that he has strained the ethnical probabili- 
ties. But so extremely winning a figure as Miss 
Cherry-Blossom is her own excuse for being (in the 
pages of a novel), and we follow her fortunes, listen 
to her delightful broken English, and share in her 
griefs with the acutest sympathy. Aside from this 
lovingly-delineated central figure, the book does not 
offer us anything particularly notable as character- 
ization or as constructive workmanship. 

" The Princess Aline " is really a short story put 
forth in the guise of a book. To say that Mr. 
Davis wrote it is to say that it is a good story, 
original in conception and brilliant in execution. 
The whimsicality of the central idea reminds us 
somehow of the kind of work that Mr. Aldrich 
used to give us in the " Marjorie Daw " period of 
his activity. It was distinctly a clever invention to 
start the hero on a long journey in quest of a woman 
whom he knew only from her photograph, to bring 
him on several occasions exasperatingly near an ac- 
quaintance only to be baffled each time by some 
untoward incident, to provide him with a sympa- 
thetic confidant and traveling-companion in the 
shape of one of his own countrywomen, and to make 
him discover in the end that the woman he really 
loved was not the one whom he had unsuccessfully 
pursued, but the one who had abetted him in the 
pursuit. Anything more exquisite in its suggestive- 
ness than the episode which closes this charming 
nouvelle is not often met with in contemporary 
fiction. 

Mr. Besant's latest novel is not a very successful 
performance, although there is some considerable 
degree of novelty in the fundamental idea. An im- 
mense fortune left by a miser supposed to have died 
intestate is provided for the reader's delectation at 
the outset, and the intrigues of the many claimants 
who promptly appear form the substance of the 
story. The novelty consists in the fact that the real 
heir, knowing his rights all the time, deliberately re- 
frains from asserting them, being influenced to this 
abstinence by the fact that the fortune had been 
accumulated by highly disreputable methods. We 
doubt if the ethics of such a case are to be taken 
for granted as fully as the author would have us 
so take them, and his scruples are rather likely to 



irritate the reader. Eventually, the heir succumbs 
to the temptation, but only in time to enjoy (in im- 
agination) his prospective wealth for a brief space, 
since the tardy discovery of a will sets at naught 
his ambitions. There is a certain impressiveness 
about the book considered merely as a study in 
heredity, for several generations of the miser's fam- 
ily are brought before us, and nearly all of its mem- 
bers fall into evil ways as if some necessary curse 
attached itself to those associated with the ill-gotten 
store. But one has only to contrast Herr Bjornson's 
" Det Flager " with the present story to realize all 
the difference between working out an idea mechan- 
ically, and working it out with psychological insight 
and artistic truth. 

" A Man of Mark " is, like " The Prisoner of 
Zenda," a story of adventure and intrigue, its scene 
laid in an imaginary South American republic, and 
told in a manner strongly suggestive of opera bouffe. 
The writer gives his fancy the freest of play, and 
his characters, despite their unreality, succeed in 
interesting us in their fortunes. The narrative has 
swiftness of action, diversity of incident, and clever- 
ness in a hundred minor touches. 

" A Romance of Dijon " carries us away to the 
fair Burgundian land, and back to the great year 
of 1789 the year of the States-General and the 
overthrow of the Bastile, and the legislation of Au- 
gust the fourth the year when a great wave of 
enthusiasm swept over the French nation, and men 
fondly believed that a new and better world might 
be built up post haste upon the ruins of the old. 
These stirring events, as they affected the lives of 
a few simple provincials a decayed nobleman, -a 
fair shop-keeping maiden, a Huguenot who had 
learned in bitter experience the meaning of the 
Revocation are the subject of the interesting story 
that Miss Betham-Edwards has told for us, and in- 
vested with the charm that comes from loving fa- 
miliarity with the types and scenes described. 

It is something of a coincidence that, simultan- 
eously with the story just mentioned, there should 
have appeared another so similar in theme and 
treatment as Miss Price's " In the Lion's Mouth." 
The same momentous years and the same provincial 
scenes are set before us by the second English- 
woman as by the first, although the result, it must be 
confessed, is less satisfactory. The author writes 
from far less knowledge of her subject, and her 
scenes and characters are the merely conventional- 
ized reflections of the average reader who has found 
interesting the history of the great Revolution. The 
story is too diffuse to hold the attention very closely, 
and, somehow or other, we take but a languid in- 
terest in the characters. Conscientious but dull 
must be the verdict upon this unpretending per- 
formance. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

Studies in 
Modern Music. 



A second series of Mr. W. H. Ha- 
dow's " Studies in Modern Music " 
(Macmillan) includes four essays. 
An introductory chapter on the " Outlines of Musi- 
cal Form " is followed by special studies upon 
Chopin, Mr. Dvorak, and Herr Brahms. Four 
portraits illustrate the text. Mr. Hadow's essay on 
musical form is one of the most searching discus- 
sions of this subject with which we are acquainted. 
Starting with the fundamental psychological con- 
siderations upon which our appreciation of music is 
based, the author proceeds to examine the princi- 
ples of structure, style, and function in musical 
composition. His treatment is not over-technical, 
although to understand it one must know the rudi- 
ments of musical grammar, and the fruitful method 
is employed of making large use of the analogies of 
literary composition. The following is a pregnant 
passage upon the subject of musical function : " The 
general function of music may be stated in a single 
word to be beautiful. It is the one art in which 
no human being can raise the false issue of a direct 
ethical influence. It allows absolutely no scope for 
the confusion of thought which, on one side, brought 
' Madame Bovary ' into the law-courts, and, on the 
other, has taught the British public to regard as a 
great religious teacher the ingenious gentleman who 
illustrated the ' Contes Drolatiques.' Of course, all 
contemplation of pure beauty is ennobling, and in 
this sense music may have the same indirect moral 
bearing as a flower, or a sunset, or a Greek statue." 
This is admirably put (the remark about Dore" being 
borrowed from Mr. Ruskin), and yet it does not 
emphasize quite sufficiently the significance of the 
" indirect moral bearing " of music. To compare 
it with a sunset or a flower in this respect is surely 
misleading, for the difference in degree is enor- 
mous. Richard Grant White and the other writers 
who have argued that the appeal of music is exclu- 
sively sensuous and intellectual have shown a singu- 
lar blindness in refusing to admit its power as a 
factor in the development of the emotional life. 
Yet this is of primary importance, for whatever 
adds to the richness and purity of that life must re- 
act upon character. We are inclined to say that 
music is ethical in the highest and best sense, al- 
though its influence be indirect. Possibly, also, the 
writer goes a little too far in his assertion of the 
thesis that the discords of one age may be the ac- 
cepted harmonies of the next. The kernel of the 
contention is in the following passage : " At the 
present day, a composer who should end a piece on 
a minor second would be deliberately violating the 
established language of the time ; and would be rep- 
rehensible, not because a minor second is ugly for 
it will be a concord some day but because, in the 
existing state of music, it could not be naturally 
placed at the close of a cadence. Imagine Handel's 
face on being shown a song when finished on a domi- 
nant seventh out of the key. And, having imagined

of Shakespeare. 



it, turn to Schumann's ' Im Wunderschonen Monat 
Mai.' " We must be content to dismiss with a word 
the three individual studies that follow this intro- 
ductory essay. They are in a high degree sympa- 
thetic and acute. The appreciation of Herr Brahms, 
in particular, with its fine but tempered enthusiasm, 
is a noteworthy contribution to musical criticism. 
The partisans of this great composer have too long 
been at swords' points with the Wagnerians ; it is 
time for sane criticism to grow catholic enough to 
enroll both composers among the great masters. 

The name of Bernhard ten Brink 
has been long familiar to students of 
English as authoritative on the lan- 
guage and literature of Chaucer; ten Brink's 
" Early English Literature," too, holds a place of 
first importance as guide to the English writers of 
the earlier epochs. The publication of his " Five 
Lectures on Shakespeare" (Holt), translated from 
a German edition by Julia Franklin, will hardly 
extend the fame of this clear-minded, finely-appreci- 
ative German critic of English letters ; for the scope 
of the volume is too limited and its purpose too modest 
for that. Its appearance, however, will emphasize the 
loss of such a mind to German and to English scholar- 
ship, while the book itself will prove a contribution 
of actual value to standard Shakespeare literature. 
The five lectures included in the volume were given 
at Frankfort-on-the-Main, if we are not mistaken, 
in the winter of 1886-7. The plan of the lectures, 
as announced by the author, is "to touch in their 
order upon the important problems to which the 
phenomenon of Shakespeare gives rise." There- 
fore the first lecture concerns itself at some length 
with a discussion of the " Shakespeare myth " with 
respect to which it was needful to speak some word 
at the beginning of such a course in such a presence. 
That word was spoken by ten Brink, calmly withal, 
yet effectually. Those who sat under the Profes- 
sor's instruction at Strassburg well remember how, 
at the beginning of a course similar to this, deliv- 
ered to his students at this very time, his " Shake- 
speare, kein My thus " rang out roundly as a key-note 
to the discussion which was to come. The titles of 
the successive lectures are : " The Poet and the 
Man," " The Chronology of Shakespeare's Works," 
" Shakespeare as a Dramatist," " Shakespeare as a 
Comic Poet," " Shakespeare as a Tragic Writer." 
The Shakespearian will find a great deal more than 
mere platitude in these chapters. There is much 
that is suggestive and not a little that is new. Par- 
ticularly helpful seems the comment on the rela- 
tionship between the dramatist's experiences and 
his creations, as found in the second lecture ; also 
the discussion of the dramatic idea in the plays, 
which occurs in the third lecture. It is of interest 
to note in passing that the author regards " King 
Lear " as the play in which " the poet attains the 
summit of his tragic powers." Details cannot be 
added here ; it is enough to call the attention of 
the student to this volume, to emphasize the intel-

ligence and dignity of its comments, the admirable 
sanity of its judgments and criticism. There is a 
compact index, and the typography of the volume 
is excellent. The publishers have given us a book 
in all respects worth while. 

Ancient teacMng, In writing "The History of Mar- 
on marriage riage " (Longmans), the learned 
Dean of Lichfield, Herbert Mortimer 
Luccock, makes no attempt to trace the history of 
marriage through all times and among all peoples. 
Himself a theologian, he aims only to discover the 
exact teaching of the Bible and the Church in the 
matters of marriage and divorce. In his opening 
chapter he considers the original institution of mar- 
riage, asserting that Eve was created that Adam 
might more fully be the image of God i. e., that 
he might not be alone ; the married state reflects 
faintly the intellectual and spiritual companionship 
which prevail within the Trinity itself. Mosaic 
legislation, Jewish custom, the teaching of the Early 
and the Later Church, are then presented to show 
that divorce was ever disapproved by them, and that 
a divorced person who marries during the lifetime 
of the former companion comes under moral con- 
demnation. In a second part of his book, Dean 
Luccock examines the Biblical and Ecclesiastical 
decisions regarding marriage to a deceased wife's 
sister. He admits that polygamy and the levinate 
existed and were apparently sanctioned among the 
Jews, but believes that they were examples of "con- 
cessive legislation " that wrongs were winked at 
because of the hardness of the Jewish heart. But 
what the Jew was allowed to do may not be best 
for the Christian, and the Church has ever protested 
against such marriages and should continue to do 
so. To readers who wish for just this sort of in- 
formation, nothing can be better than the book be- 
fore us. The author's style is attractive ; his learn- 
ing is great ; his heart is in the subject, and he feels 
that the prevailing laxity in these matters is dan- 
gerous. Perhaps, however, it is best that each gen- 
eration should deal with its own living questions in 
its own way. The present is little likely to be much 
affected by the ecclesiastical decisions of by-gone 
times. It is hardly probable that the legislation of 
the twentieth century will be much influenced by 
the fact that at the Spanish Council of Elvira, in 
305 A.D., a penalty was inflicted upon a man who 
married his dead wife's sister. 



Introduction 
to English 
Literature. 



" An Introduction to English Liter- 
ature" (Holt), by Mr. Henry S. Pan- 
coast, seems to us as close an approach 
as has yet been made to the ideal text-book for sec- 
ondary-school use. It is compact, admirable in se- 
lection of material, reasonable in judgment, well- 
proportioned as regards historical and critical 
matter, divided into well-defined sections, and well 
provided with tables, lists of books, and other help- 
ful apparatus. It does not make the mistake of 
attempting to include extracts (except for the brief- 



est of illustrative passages), but sends students di- 
rectly to the literature itself ; it is a working hand- 
book which keeps in view the needs of young people, 
and passes briefly over many matters that would 
deserve much space in a history proper of English 
literature ; it does not seek to enforce cut-and-dried 
critical judgments. About one-half of the text is 
given to writers of the last hundred years, and about 
one-half of that to the Victorians. The importance 
of knowing English history (in the broad social 
sense) is everywhere inculcated. We have noticed 
a few misprints and other inaccuracies, but nothing 
very serious, as the book has the special advantage 
of being the revision and correction of an earlier 
publication by the same author. Altogether, we 
can recommend it as a manual likely to attract the 
young mind rather than to repel, the one essential 
condition being granted of its use by a sympathetic 
teacher, full of enthusiasm for his subject and his 
work.

of a translator having quality rather than quantity 
for an aim, and having the ability to write English 
as well as the ability to read some foreign language. 
Among the few translators possessed of these qual- 
ifications, Professor Melville B. Anderson occupies 
a conspicuous place, and his several translations 
from the French are characterized at once by the 
excellence of their English and by the knowledge 
of the foreign idiom displayed. The most re- 
markable of the series is undoubtedly Hugo's "Will- 
iam Shakespeare," which is a tour de force in En- 
glish as it is in the original. But Professor Ander- 
son has, in addition, given us versions of several 
volumes in the series of " Grands Ecrivains Fran- 
cais," and now offers us the first really acceptable 
English translation that has ever been made of St. 
Pierre's "Paul and Virginia" (McClurg). In its 
present form, the reader ignorant of French may 
for the first time understand why the work has so 
undisputed a rank among the classics. Heretofore 
he has had to take the statement on faith. Besides 
the translation, Professor Anderson gives us an ad- 
mirable Introduction of some fifty pages, biograph- 
ical, critical, and bibliographical. But why does 
he continually refer to a recent biographer of St.- 
Pierre as " Barine ? " The work appears in the 
series of " Laurel Crowned Tales."

nected papers ; and if this were his first acquaint- 
ance with " A. K. H. B.," he would desire to know 
him more thoroughly by reading "Twenty -five 
Years of St. Andrews " and " Recreations of a

his own. We are not prepared to say that it would 
be improved by a greater conformity to conven- 
tional rules of punctuation and italicization. It

"A Text -Book of the History of 
Painting" (Longmans), by Professor 
John C. Van Dyke, is the initial vol- 
ume of a promising series ( edited by Professor Van 
Dyke) of concise art manuals designed especially 
for class-room use. The little volume seems a model 
of pith, lucidity, and practical convenience ; and 
that it is sound and accurate the author's name is a 
sufficient guarantee. Essential historical and bio- 
graphical facts, together with brief critical esti- 
mates and characterizations of leading schools and 
painters, are given in a few well-chosen words ; and 
for students who wish to pursue the subject in de- 
tail, a list of selected authorities at the head of each 
chapter points the way. Serviceable lists are also 
provided of principal extant works, together with 
the places where they are to be found. The text is 
liberally sprinkled with illustrations in half-tone.

" Lady Stuart." ( lait & oons ), a pretty volume trans- 
lated by A. C. S. from the French of 
M. Paul de Lano, recounts an episode of the Tuil- 
eries under the Second Empire that recalls the 
adage about truth and fiction. The story seems, at 
first blush, suspiciously melodramatic ; but M. de 
Lano had his facts from "Lady Stuart" herself 
( whose interest lay rather in suppressing them than 
in publishing them), and he seems satisfied of their 
truth. Intrigue, seduction, kidnapping, murder, and 
court-yahooism generally, form the sufficiently pun- 
gent elements of the drama ; and it is hard to say 
which of its royal and titled protagonists played the 
most discreditable part. The storm of Sedan would 
seem to have cleared the moral as well as the polit- 
ical atmosphere in France. There is a fine portrait 
of " Lady Stuart." 

The second volume of the publica- 
tions of the American Folk-lore So-

fairy tales, probably from India. No examples 
are given of the vaudesvilles, or tales and songs, 
which complete the three kinds of folk-tales found

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Frank Preston Stearns's " Life and Genius of 
Tintoretto " (Putnam) is a scholarly and well consid- 
ered study of the great Venetian and his art the most 
ambitious attempt of the kind, we think, that has yet 
appeared in English. Mr. Stearns has spared no pains 
to make his book as complete as possible biographically, 
and his appreciations of the master's style and genius 
are delicate and just. There are four well-executed 
illustrations in photogravure. 

Miss Wormeley's translation of Moliere (Roberts) 
has reached its third volume, which gives us versions 
of " Les Femmes Savantes " and " Le Malade Imagin- 
aire." The introduction to this volume is mainly de- 
voted to a historical sketch of the Hotel de Rambouillet, 
which, of course, suggested the former of the two plays. 
Of the other, little is said or need be. Its satirical qual- 
ity is obvious enough, and its pathetic association with 
the death of the author is too familiar a fact to call for 
more than bare mention. 

We take pleasure in noting the completion, by the 
publication of a fourth volume, of the magnificent illus- 
trated edition of Green's " Short History of the English 
People " (Harper), edited by Mrs. Green and Miss Nor- 
gate. This fourth volume is in all respects worthy of 
its predecessors, and it would be superfluous to repeat 
the words of praise that we have already bestowed upon 
the undertaking now happily carried to a conclusion. 
The work is indeed one that " no gentleman's library 
should be without." 

Volume III. of Mr. Conway's edition of " The Writ- 
ings of Thomas Paine " (Putnam) has just appeared, 
and covers the period from 1791 to 1804. It includes 
the peculiarly interesting years of Paine's experience as 
a French revolutionist. The longest of the works re- 
printed are the "Memorial to Monroe" (1795), the 
" Letter to George Washington " (1796), and the series 
of " Letters to the Citizens of the United States " (1802- 
1804). It is safe to say that Mr. Conway's labors are 
for the first time presenting the true Paine to the eyes 
of his fellow-countrymen. 

A chatty, pleasantly written book, containing many 
curious scraps of out-of-the-way information and gos- 
sip, is Mr. Henry W. Wolff's " Odd Bits of History " 
(Longmans). Such headings as " The Pretender at Bar- 
le-Duc," "Richard de la Pole, 'White Rose,'" "Vol- 
taire and King Stanislas," " Something about Beer," etc., 
indicate the drift of the papers, which originally appeared 
as review articles. The volume is written in a very 
agreeable style, recalling the author's charming " Black 
Forest Rambles " of some four years ago. 

The volumes of the " Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy " (Macmillan) come to us with more than the reg- 
ularity of the seasons. No. XLII. is now at hand, be- 
ginning with O'Duinn and ending with Owen. It has, 
as may be imagined, a marked Celtic flavor. But 
sprinkled among the Irishmen in O' we find the names 
of Oliphant, Otway, and Overbury, to say nothing of 
the long line of Owens at the end.

The annual meeting of the Walt Whitman Fellow- 
ship is set for May 31, at Philadelphia. There will be 
speeches and a dinner. All interested in Whitman are 
invited by the secretary, Mr. H. L. Traubel. 

We learn from " The Bookman " that Professor C. 
G. D. Roberts has resigned his post at Windsor, N. S., 
and intends to make his home in the United States. 
We can assure him of a hearty welcome from our lit- 
erary folk. 

Mr. W. I. Fletcher will superintend a five weeks' 
summer school of library economy at Amherst this year, 
beginning July 1. The class will be conducted as one 
of beginners, and the course offered will afford an ex- 
cellent basis for professional training, although it can 
hardly be expected to transform the raw student at 
once into an accomplished librarian. Mr. Cutter's " Rules 
for Cataloguing " will be the chief text-book used. 

The Stevenson manuscripts, now in possession of Mr. 
Charles Baxter, who is negotiating for their publication, 
include the following: " Vailima Letters," a sort of 
diary inscribed to Mr. Sidney Colvin; "St. Ives," a 
romance within two chapters of completion; a 50,000- 
word fragment, complete in itself, of " Weir of Hermis- 
ton "; The Great North Road," a tale in about 15,000 
words; a small volume of " Fables "; and a series of 
letters to children on history. Mr. Colvin, by the way, 
will be Stevenson's biographer. 

The Woman's Club of Chicago seized the occasion of 
Shakespeare's birthday to offer a reception to the " lit- 
erary fraternity " of the city and vicinity. A number 
of brief addresses were made, those of Mr. H. W. Ma- 
bie and Mrs. Lindon Bates being noticeable for both sub- 
stance and point, and the affair as a whole was very en- 
joyable. Others present included Mr. Henry B. Fuller, 
General O. O. Howard, Miss Eliza Allen Starr, Miss 
Harriet Monroe, Miss Blanche Fearing, Miss Lilian Bell, 
and Mrs. Mary Hartwell Catherwood. Art other than 
the literary was well represented by M. Raffaelli and 
Miss Harriet Hosmer, both of whom were among the 
speakers. 

A literary trouvaille of extraordinary interest is re- 
ported by Mr. G. C. Macaulay in the last " Academy " 
to reach us. It is nothing less than a manuscript poem 
of the fourteenth century which is believed to be the 
" Speculum Meditantis " of Gower the lost French 
poem. The work is thus described : " It proves to be 
a poem of about 29,000 octosyllabic lines, in stanzas of 
twelve lines each, which rhyme a aba ab b b ab b a. 
The MS., which appears to be of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, has at present 152 leaves, including one that is 
glued down to the binding at the beginning. After this 
first leaf, on which we have the title Mirour de lomme ' 
and a table of the ten parts of the poem, four leaves 
have been cut out, and seven more are missing in other 



parts of the book, besides some it is uncertain how 
many at the end. Thus the beginning and the end of 
the poem are both wanting; and the object of my de- 
scription is partly to direct attention to the title and 
form of the book, in order that a perfect copy may be 
found, if it anywhere exists. Probably not much is lost 
at the end, for the poem seems to be nearing its con- 
clusion when the MS. breaks off." The work was un- 
earthed in the Cambridge University Library.

THE DIAL 



Fifteen Years of THE DIAL. 

MAY 1, 1880 MAY 1, 1895. 



WITH the present number, THE DIAL begins its sixteenth year. The significant 
features of its career may be comprehended in the statement that in these 
fifteen years there has been no essential change in the form, aims, or character of 
the journal, beyond increased frequency of issue and a steady expansion along lines 
originally contemplated; and that it continues with the same management under 
which it was founded. A further statement of what it has achieved may best be given 
in the words of others. 

FIFTEEN APPRECIATIONS OF THE T>1AL 



" Admirable in typography and make-up, schol- 
arly and dignified in tone, free from the petty per- 
sonalities which disfigure the pages of most ' literary ' 
journals of to-day, and the literary columns of most 
of our newspapers, and marked by the highest qual- 
ities of criticism discernment, catholicity, and 
good taste THE DIAL is easily and in every sense 
the best literary journal published in this country." 
W. I. FLETCHER, Amherst College, March, 1895. 

Chicago possesses " a critical paper equal in ability 
to anything we have in this country." WALTER 
BESANT, London, March, 1895. 

" THE DIAL is the best and ablest literary paper 
in the country." JOHN G. WHITHER, Aug. 19, 
1892. 

" THE DIAL I think is by far the best of our lit- 
erary journals. It stands up against provinciality, 
yet is not servile to foreign critics. It holds to the 
old, while not turning its back on the new. It is 
sane and honest, and while sympathetic has nothing 
of the gush that we sometimes find." W. P. 
TRENT, University of the South. 

" THE DIAL is the best publication of its kind in 
this country." JOHN BURROUGHS, New York. 

" THE DIAL is the foremost critical journal in 
the country, and fully and worthily represents the 
profession of letters and the interest of cultivated 
readers." EVENING JOURNAL, Chicago. 

" THE DIAL'S look and bearing are refinement 
itself. Seriousness, fearless care, and a right in- 
stinct in letters, help to make it the best review we 
have." THE INDEPENDENT, New York. 



" THE DIAL is a true review. It has kept the 
even tenor of its way, each succeeding year indicat- 
ing widened vista, and every page sober, candid, 
and as a rule singularly just." THE HERALD, 
Chicago. 

" I have always admired the superb editorial care 
which THE DIAL exhibits." WILLIAM T. HARRIS, 
U. S. Commissioner of Education. 

"THE DIAL is the journal de luxe among Amer- 
ican literary periodicals." THE ARGONAUT, San 
Francisco. 

" THE DIAL has been well conducted from the 
start, with a serious purpose, and with much learned 
and intelligent collaboration, and we have had fre- 
quent occasion to praise it and to wish it a long 
life." THE NATION, New York. 

" I have the greatest admiration for THE DIAL 
and its work." Rev. Dr. EDWARD EVERETT HALE, 
Boston. 

" THE DIAL is easily the first among the journals 
in this country devoted to literary criticism. As a 
journal for the teacher who would keep in touch 
with the best thought of the day, it is indispensa- 
ble." JOURNAL OF PEDAGOGY, New York. 

" THE DIAL seems to me to preserve a higher 
critical standard, as regards literature, than any 
other American journal with which I happen to be 
acquainted." EDMUND W. GOSSE, London, En- 
gland. 

" THE DIAL is in my opinion the best critical 
journal in this country." HJALMAR HJORTH 
BOTESEN, New York.

'HAVE JUST PUBLISHED 

A Midsummer Night's Dream. 

Volume X. of the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare's 
Plays. Edited by HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Ph.D., 
LL.D., L.H.D. In one handsome octavo volume of 
350 pages. Cloth, 84.00. 

The publishers take great pleasure in announcing a new 
volume of the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare's Plays. 
This edition, edited by the ablest living Shakespearian scholar, 
has been received everywhere with the greatest possible favor, 
and has been considered by all critics as the most exhaustive 
work on Shakespeare's plays. For the study of the play Mr. 
Furness's edition is as invaluable as it is indispensable, and is 
without question the most complete in existence, as the editor 
has naturally taken advantage of the labors of all former 
Shakespearian scholars, English, French, and German. 

The text of the First Folio, the Editio Princeps, has been 
again adopted in the present play, being reproduced from the 
editor's copy with every exactitude. Time has but confirmed 
Mr. Furness in his conviction that this is the text which a 
student needs constantly before him ; and in a majority of 
the plays it is the freshest from Shakespeare's own hand. 
The various readings of all the early editions are noted line by 
line, while the notes are a choice selection from all the com- 
mentators. 

The New Variorum Edition of 
Shakespeare. 

Edited by HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Ph.D., LL.D., 
L.H.D. Royal octavo volumes. Extra cloth, uncut 
edges, gilt top, $4.00. 

The ten volumes already issued bound in half-morocco, 
gilt top, $50.00. Sold only in sets. 

A Midsummer Night's Dream. 
The Tempest. King Lear. 

As You Like It. Hamlet (2voU.). 

The Merchant of Venice. Macbeth. 
Othello. Romeo and Juliet. 

"In conclusion I desire to thank the many friends who 
have assisted me in the work, and without whose help my 
difficulties would have been greatly increased. I would espe- 
cially record my obligations above all to my constant friend, 
Dr. Horace Howard Furness of Philadelphia, whose monu- 
mental volumes are the admiration of every true student of 
Shakespeare." WILLIAM ALDIS WRIGHT, Editor of Cam- 
bridge Edition. 

"Horace Howard Furness is probably the most thorough 
Shakespearian student who has ever lived, and this work is a 
monument of learning, of patient research, and of intelligent 
application such as has rarely been produced in the world of 
literature." Boston Courier. 

" America has the honor of having produced the very best 
and most complete edition, so far as it has gone, of our great 
national poet. For text, illustration, commentary, and criti- 
cism it leaves nothing to be desired." Blackwood's Edin- 
burgh Magazine. 

" We do not hesitate to say that Horace Howard Furness's 
Variorum Edition is one of the most notable contributions to 
Shakespeare literature in the present century." Manchester 
(England) Guardian.

16mo, pp. 116, 40 cents net. 

"Teachers who have examined these volumes need not be reminded that they furnish, more clearly than anything else

A TEXT=BOOK OF INORGANIC 
CHEMISTRY. 

By G. S. NEWTH, F.I.C., F.C.S., Demonstrator in the Royal 
College of Science, London ; Assistant Examiner in Chem- 
istry, Science, and Art Department. With 146 Illustrations. 
Crown 8vo, $1.75 net. 

"The great feature about the book is that it is not cast upon the 
lines of any syllabus, being intended to be an educational work, and not 
a ' cram ' book. In regard to the illustrations, which in text-books do 
so much to frame the students' ideas, the work is unique and positively 
refreshing. The text is thoroughly up to date, even so far as to give 
currency to another gaseous constituent of air, the discovery of which 
Lord Raleigh and Prof. Ramsay announced only two months ago. At 
the same time the requirements of the student have not been forgotten, 
technical descriptions being scarce. In short the work aims at being a 
genuine text-book of the science of Chemistry, and ably fulfils its ob- 
ject, being one of the best theoretical text-books we have met with for 
a long time." Chemical Trade Journal. 

THE EVOLUTION OF WHIST. 

A Study of the Progressive Changes which the Game has 
Passed Through from Its Origin to the Present Time. By 
WILLIAM POLE, F.R.S., author of "The Theory of the 
Modern Scientific Game of Whist," "The Philosophy of 
Whist," etc.; Honorary Member of the American Whist 
League. Small 8vo, Art Linen, $1.50. 

" More than half of Mr. Pole's book is devoted to the modern game, 
and he not only has a full account of the evolution of the American 
leads, but also devoted a special chapter of over forty pages to the sub- 
ject of ' Whist in America,' in which he reviews whist customs in vogue 
here, the system of duplicate whist, the history of the American Whist 
League, the influence of professional teaching, the more noteworthy 
contributions to American whist literature, and the difficulties and dis- 
putes which have arisen out of what the author regards as an arbitrary 
and excessive employment of the use of signals. ... It is evident that 
the advanced student of whist will find much to entertain and instruct 
him in Mr. Pole's admirably written volume." Beacon (Boston). 



THE WORLD AS THE SUBJECT OF 
REDEMPTION. 

By the Hon. and Rev. W. H. FBEMANTLE, M.A., Dean of 
Ripon and Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. With an In- 
troduction by RICHARD T. ELY, Ph.D., LL:D. Second Edi- 
tion, Revised. Crown 8vo, $2.00 net. 

A MODERN PRIESTESS OF ISIS 
(Madame Blavatsky). 

Abridged and Translated on behalf of the Society for Psy- 
chical Research from the Russian of VSEVOLOD SERGYEE- 
VICH SOLOVYOFF. By WALTER LEAF, Litt.D. With Ap- 
pendices. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

" The volume has a very decided interest as a biographical study and 
as a piece of graceful and effective literature. Mr. Solovyoff knew 
Madame Blavatsky intimately ; he traces her career to the minutest de- 
tail ; and he analyzes the so-called occult manifestations which were so 
essential a part of her propaganda with a subtlety and decisiveness which 
leave little to be desired. Not only Madame Blavatsky's career in Eu- 
rope, but her exploits in America and her alliance with the spiritists of 
this country, are fully related. Anyone at all interested in what may 
be called the psychology of error cannot fail to be soundly edified by 
Mr. Solovyoff's work. " Beacon (Boston). 

A PRIMER OF EVOLUTION. 

By EDWARD CLODD, author of " The Childhood of the 
World," "The Story of Creation," etc. Illustrated. 16mo, 
Polished Buckram, 75 cents. 

" Mr. Clodd . . . has in the present volume provided a summary of 
the doctrine of evolution in a form that commends itself for its breadth 
of reasoning, its exactitude in scientific detail, and the clearness and 
impressiveness in which the whole argument is set forth ... it is not 
too much to say that no one can call himself even fairly well educated 
without having mastered the greater part of the information which Mr. 
Clodd so attractively presents." Beacon (Boston).

" President Hyde does not aim to upset established religion, only to point put how the article we now have may be improved on its social side,

G USTA V FRE YTA G. 

The first day of this month brought word of 
the death of Gustav Freytag, at Wiesbaden, 
where he had lived in retirement since 1879. 
Freytag has been, on the whole, the most con- 
spicuous figure in the German literature of the 
half-century now nearly ended, and of his con- 
temporaries among belletristic prose - writers,, 
not more than half a dozen Renter, Auer- 
bach, and Scheffel among the dead, Hen-en 
Spielhagen, Heyse, and Dahn among the living 
can claim a rank comparable with his. The 
life-work upon which his reputation rests was 
practically done during the quarter-century be- 
tween 1855 and 1880, and of late years, al- 
though not wholly inactive, he has appeared a 
figure of the past rather than of the present. 
But his death seems none the less a shock, and 
his loss will be deeply mourned by the country 
of which he so honored the literature, and 
which stands to-day in greater need than ever 
of the social ideals inculcated by his works. 

Freytag was born at Kreuzberg, in Silesia, 
July 13, 1816, thus living nearly to complete 
his seventy-ninth year. The son of a physician, 
he received his gymnasial training at Oels, 
and continued his studies at the Universities 
of Breslau and Berlin. Teutonic philology was 
his special subject, and his thesis for the doc- 
torate, offered in 1838, was entitled "De Ini- 
tiis Scenicae Poeseos apud Germanos." The 
years 1839 1846 were spent at Breslau as a 
privat-docent. In 1847 he married a lady of 
rank and wealth, removed to Dresden, and 
shortly thereafter to Leipzig, where he engaged 
in the editorial conduct of " Die Grenzboten." 
His connection with this periodical was main- 
tained (with an intermission from 1861 to 
1867) until 1870. He had meanwhile (1867) 
become a liberal member of the Nord-Deutscher 
Reichstag. When the war of 1870 came, he 
joined the staff of the Crown Prince, and re- 
mained in the service up to Sedan. In that 
year also he became associated with the new 
weekly paper " Im Deutschen Reich." The 
loss of his wife in 1873, a subsequent marriage 
followed by a second bereavement, and his re- 
moval to Wiesbaden, constitute the remaining 
facts of external interest in his life.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



Freytag's literary activity began during his 
years as a decent at Breslau, with a volume 
of lyrical poems, and four dramas " Die 
Brautfahrt," " Der Gelehrte," "Die Valen- 
tine," and " Graf Waldemar." Two other 
dramas, " Die Journalisten " (1854) and " Die 
Fabier " (1859), complete the list of his writ- 
ings for the stage, although in his " Technik 
des Dramas," published many years later, he 
was to do dramatic art an even greater service 
than that of producing so acceptable and health- 
ful a stage-play as kt Die Journalisten." This 
discussion of the principles of dramatic art, 
the recent English translation of which was re- 
viewed in THE DIAL for February 1 of the pres- 
ent year, is one of the most valuable of modern 
contributions to the subject with which it deals, 
and has the added weight of coming from a 
highly successful writer of plays. 

Freytag's greatest work, the novel " Soil und 
Haben," well known to English readers as 
*' Debit and Credit," appeared in 1855, and at 
once won for its writer the most cordial recog- 
nition from all discerning critics, although there 
were not lacking those who saw in the work 
the apotheosis of philistinism. Deliberately put- 
ting aside the romantic ideals of contemporary 
German novelists, the author of " Soil und 
Haben " made of the merchant type the centre 
of interest, and the world of commerce that in 
which the scenes were laid. Realism of the 
good honest sort dominates this work, which 
depicts with unsurpassed fidelity the manners 
of a provincial town. Romantic elements, such 
as the episode of the Polish insurrection, are 
not lacking, but they are strictly subordinated 
to the controlling idea of the novel, which is 
that of rehabilitating in the eyes of the novel- 
reader those types of character which he is too 
apt to set lightly aside as prosaic, although 
they form the bone and sinew of every modern 
nation well advanced in the ways of civiliza- 
tion. That commercial integrity is as fine a 
thing as military glory, that the virtues of so- 
briety, patience, perseverance, devotion to the 
task at hand, and the performance of the hum- 
blest duties just because they are duties, are 
among the worthiest objects of endeavor these 
are the lessons of the work, not too obtrusively 
inculcated, but every where underlying its struc- 
ture. So genuine a piece of fiction is not often 
met with, or one that will so well bear scrutiny. 

" Die Verlorne Handschrift," published in 
1864, following the first novel at an inter- 
val of nearly ten years, is less obviously a mas- 
terpiece than " Soil und Haben," yet it must 



always occupy a high rank among the best pro- 
ducts of German fiction. The story is that of 
a university professor, a large part of whose 
life is spent in the search for a manuscript of 
Tacitus, which he has reason to believe is still 
extant. His fate may be compared to that of 
Saul the son of Kish, for, while the manuscript 
eludes his pursuit, he finds instead, and wins 
for his wife, a very charming woman. The 
book abounds in admirable passages descrip- 
tive of life in a university town and at the 
court of a petty German prince. The author- 
does not gild the commonplace as successfully 
as in " Soil und Haben," and his attempt to 
be humorous must be reckoned a distinct fail- 
ure. On the other hand, the work abounds in 
fine, even eloquent, passages, among which the 
occasional characterizations of Tacitus are the 
most impressive. These, however, are the work 
rather of the essayist and historian than of the 
novelist, and our enjoyment of them has little 
to do with our interest in the story. The un- 
derlying purpose of " Die Verlorne Hand- 
schrift " is the exaltation of the scholar's life, 
at the expense of more popular ideals, just as 
the purpose of " Soil und Haben " is the glori- 
fication if we may use so strong a word of 
the even less romantic life of the honest mer- 
chant. These two ideals, surely among the 
worthiest that can be urged, were and are pecu- 
liarly needed in Germany, where the unworthy 
ideals of militarism and the aristocracy are 
still opposed to them, and still have a stronger 
hold upon the nation than in most other civil- 
ized countries. 

The books thus far enumerated, together 
with the series of " Bilder aus der Deutchen 
Vergangenheit " (1859-62) and the biography 
of his friend Karl Mathy (1870), complete the 
list of Freytag's works up to the period of the 
War of 1870. The outcome of that conflict, 
so important to every German in its political 
significance, must be reckoned among the in- 
fluences that shaped the literary activity of the 
novelist's remaining years. The most ambi- 
tious of all his undertakings is that of which 
the execution was begun soon after 1870, and 
which has represented the greater part of his 
literary activity since that date. It was during 
the course of the War that the plan of " Die 
Ahnen " suggested itself to his mind, and the 
first person to whom the project was confided 
was the Crown Prince. The scope of the pro- 
posed work was thus defined in the dedication : 
" This work is to contain a series of freely in- 
vented tales, in which are related the destinies

of one family. It begins with ancestors of an 
early time, and shall (if the author retain his 
vigor and his interest in the work) be gradu- 
ally brought down to the latest descendant, a 
hearty fellow who is now going about under the 
light of the German sun, without concerning 
himself very much about the deeds or trials of 
his forefathers. The book aims to contain po- 
etic fiction, and by no means a ' history of 
culture.' ' With these introductory words may 
be placed the other words appended to the last 
volume of the series : " The author of 'Die 
Ahnen ' will be gratified if the reader will con- 
sider the work as a symphony, in whose eight 
parts a melodic theme is varied, carried out, 
and interwoven with others, in such a manner 
that all the parts, taken together, form a unit." 

The eight sections of " Die Ahnen " were 
published in six volumes, between 1872 and 
1880. The first volume, " Ingo und Ingraban," 
contains two episodes, both placed in Thuringia, 
and dealing respectively with the fourth and 
the eighth centuries, with the Germanic strug- 
gle against Roman domination and the later 
struggle of the Franks against the encroaching 
Slavs. " Das Nest der Zaunkb'nige " (1874) 
deals with the eleventh century and the ree's- 
tablishment of the imperial power by Henry II. 
" Die Briider vom Deutschen Hause " (1875) 
brings us to the thirteenth century, to the cru- 
sades, chivalry, and Frederick II. " Marcus 
Kb'nig" (1876) is concerned with the period 
of the Reformation. "Die Geschwister " 
(1878) consists of two parts, "Der Rittmeis- 
ter von Alt-Rosen," placed just after the Thirty 
Years' War, and " Der Foldcorporal bei Mark- 
graf-Albrecht," placed in the times of Freder- 
ick William I. of Prussia. " Aus einer Kleinen 
Stadt " (1880) brings us down to the Napol- 
eonic invasion and the German national upris- 
ing of 1813. To this tale is added a " Schluss," 
in which the latest descendant of Ingo becomes 
a liberal editor and political idealist of our own 
times. For a fuller account of the work, we 
may refer to Professor James T. Hatfield's 
school edition of " Der Rittmeister," to which 
we are indebted for some of the facts above 
mentioned. German fiction has few works equal 
to " Die Ahnen " in symmetry of plan and ex- 
cellence of execution, and no student of the 
literature can afford to leave the series unread. 

The temper in which Freytag wrote, not only 
" Die Ahnen," but his other books of fiction as 
well, may be illustrated by a " thought" which 
he contributed as a sort of motto to the English 
translation of " Die Verlorne Handschrift " 



made five years ago, and issued by the Open 
Court Publishing Company. " An efficient hu- 
man life does not end upon earth with death ; 
it persists in the disposition and acts of friends, 
as well as in the thoughts and activities of the 
nation." This sense of the ideal continuity of 
soul-life is perhaps the main underlying motive 
of the best part of Freytag's work ; a work, 
let us add, that everywhere appeals to the deep- 
est and best instincts of our nature. 



D ( R. LOW'S GIFT TO COLUMBIA. 

President Low's magnificent gift of a million 
dollars, to be devoted to a library building for Co- 
lumbia College, is a signal illustration of what is 
sometimes called the " new philanthropy." The 
donor wishes the library to stand as a memorial of 
his father, the late Abiel Abbott Low, " a merchant 
who taught his son to value the things for which 
Columbia College stands." The announcement of 
this gift was accompanied by that of a gift from 
Mr. W. C. Schermerhorn, of three hundred thou- 
sand dollars, for the construction of another depart- 
ment building, the giver suggesting his preference 
for a scientific laboratory of some sort. Since Presi- 
dent Low's inauguration, five years ago, Columbia 
has been made the recipient of gifts amounting al- 
together to more than five millions of dollars, a rec- 
ord hardly outdone by the new University of Chi- 
cago. It is, in our opinion, peculiarly fitting that 
the central building of a great university should be 
the library, rather than the laboratory or the lec- 
ture hall. The library typifies historical and hu- 
manistic culture, and for this the university should 
stand more distinctly than for anything else, al- 
though by no means narrowly or exclusively. A 
library building, with an adequate fund for its en- 
dowment, is the best of all possible gifts to a great 
institution of learning, and President Low is to be 
thanked for the wisdom of his choice no less heart- 
ily than for his munificence. 



C OMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE "MISSIONARY QUESTION" IN CHINA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It was with regret that I noted some of the positions 
taken in the article on " Far Eastern Pictures and Prob- 
lems," in THE DIAL of May 1 ; especially those relating 
to the " Missionary Question." These positions seem 
to me very superficial, and, indeed, self-evidently un- 
sound; amounting to the assumption that Christianity 
is not adapted to the Chinese, and therefore untrue. If 
evidence of such non-adaptation is to be found in China, 
certainly none of it has been presented in the article in 
question. There are plenty of places in civilized lands 
where Christianity (as it is commonly understood) is 
making no appreciable progress; but it does not neces-

sarily follow that this is the fault either of Christianity 
or of those upon whom its claims are urged. The ser- 
vant who had " got that Jesus pidgin " for the revenue 
there was in it may be numerously duplicated in every 
American and English city. The position of the priest, 
who is quoted against the possibility of the Christianiz- 
ing of China, is extremely inconsistent, and his own im- 
plied non-success is anything but conclusive. The mo- 
tives attributed to the suicides might with equal 
plausibility for anything that appears in the narrative 
be imputed in Western instances. 

" Asia for the Asiatics," far from being a reactionary 
principle, as the article seems to imply, appears to me 
to be a perfectly sound and wholesome one. Surely the 
only adequate and hopeful development of Japan, as of 
any other nation, is a self-development. I trust that 
neither Mr. Norman nor his reviewer would have the 
Asiatics repeat the experiences of our American In- 
dians. 

The reference to " tireless Russia," at the close of 
the article, suggests the exploded notions regarding 
" the sleeping Leviathan of the Orient " mentioned at 
the beginning. Russia is no stranger to some of the 
conditions which have weakened China. 

I know of no evidence that the " Missionary Ques- 
tion " is a " vexed " one, except in the imagination of 
those who wish it were so. WILLIAM HARPER. 

Americus, Georgia, May 4* 1895. 

[Our correspondent is mistaken in imputing to us 
" positions relating to the Missionary Question " 
advanced by Mr. Norman and the missionaries he 
cites, and distinctly credited to them by Mr. Nor- 
man's reviewer. We must also respectfully but 
firmly disclaim the view, unkindly charged to us by 
Mr. Harper, that Christianity is untrue because the 
Chinese don't like it. Our own limited experience 
of John Chinaman leads us to think rather better 
of him than Mr. Norman does ; but we are not pre- 
pared to go the length of setting up his opinions as 
a general standard of truth. As to the Chinese sui- 
cides, we doubt if Mr. Harper can find (even in 
Georgia) a single " Western instance " parallel to 
the cases given by Mr. Norman ; while that the 
Missionary Question is, as Mr. Norman thinks, a 
" vexed " one seems pretty fairly inferable from Mr. 
Harper's note. EDK. DIAL.] 

BROWNING'S OPTIMISM, SO-CALLED. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Agreeing with the main argument of the article on 
" The Ibsen Legend " in your last issue, may I be al- 
lowed to take issue with the writer on a side question ? 
It is not necessary to follow a writer in his denials, 
which usually represent his limitations, because we 
heartily concur in his affirmations, which, if he be sin- 
cere, represent his personal experience. Why should 
Browning be classed with Emerson as a builder of a 
royal summer-house in a fool's paradise ? Is Browning 
an optimist when he speaks for himself ? Indeed, the 
reverse seems to be true. So far as this earth-life is 
concerned, he is quite as much a pessimist as St. Paul 
and Schopenhauer. The difference between Browning 
and Schopenhauer in this respect would seem to be that 
the first, incapable of accepting the witness of reason 
confined to the data of terrestrial experience, imagines 



other data, and constantly reads back a meaning into 
this life which without that other life it simply could 
not have to any sane and conscientious observer of all 
its facts. Schopenhauer limits himself to those, and 
therefore reports as he sees regnant Evil ! In " La 
Saisiaz " we have Browning speaking for himself. 

"What to me is pain and pleasure: this is sure, the rest 

surmize." 
" I must say or choke in silence ' How soever came my 

fate, 

Sorrow did and joy did nowise life well-weighed, prepon- 
derate.' 

By Necessity ordained thus ? I shall bear as best I can ; 
By a Cause all-good, all-wise, all-potent? No, as I am a 
man ! " 

" Only grant a second life ; I acquiesce 

In this present life as failure, count misfortune's worst as- 
saults 

Triumph, not defeat, assured that loss so much the more 
exalts 

Gain about to be 

Worst were best, defeat were triumph, utter loss were utmost 

gain." 
"So I hope no more than hope, but hope no less than 

hope." 

Of course it remains a matter of delicate and more 
or less personal estimate how far this or that character 
speaks for its creator. Alas, Browning, like Dr. Ibsen, 
is dramatic ! But when we have before us such a plain 
confession as " La Saisiaz " is anyone justified in making 
out Browning a fool, as any man must be who prefers 
a fool's paradise to the world of facts ? no more, 
surely, than another can be in calling Dr. Ibsen "icy," 
" grim," " egotistical," " intolerably pessimistic," be- 
cause he ventures to speak the truth of this moral chaos 
in which we, natural lovers of Kosmos, are imprisoned. 
I would only, therefore, blame the writer of that excel- 
lent plea for Dr. Ibsen's sanity (as against Professor 
Nordau's somewhat amusing wholesale disposal of al- 
most all men of ability excepting his modest self) for 
a hasty thrust at another much maligned man. Is it 
well, in helping the public over an acute attack of 
" Ibsen-o-phobia," to encourage the development of that 
other disease " Browning-o-phobia " ? (Let the hyphen- 
ated " o " in my two fantastic compounds represent the 
agonies of the poor demented public that is always try- 
ing to crucify on the charge of blasphemy its truth- 
tellers and chief-lovers.) 

Oh, that we would not rob Paul to pay Peter ! 
There is all the difference in the world between an 
optimism that is the result of ignorance and inexperi- 
ence an optimism that is not at all disagreeable in a 

foot-ball champion or a robust school-graduate and an 
optimism like St. Paul's and like Browning's, which dif- 
fers from frank pessimism only in its superb assumption 
of a yet unseen and incomprehensible hereafter and 
beyond: 
" On the earth the broken arch ; in the heavens the perfect 

round." 

For Emerson, I am not prepared to speak. However, 
I believe he can be classed with Browning as a " Tran- 
scendental Optimist," i.e., as one who converts theoretical 
pessimism into practical optimism by means of an as- 
sumption a mere " surmize," as Browning calls it 
that " Goodness, wisdom, power " are not " all bounded, 
each a human attribute"; that our present "life, time 
with all their chances, changes," are " just probation- 
space." W. N. G.

BIGELOW'S IjIFE OF TILDEN.* 



We regret that while commending Dr. John 
Bigelow's " Life of Samuel J. Tilden " as in 
many respects a satisfactory book, we cannot 
wholly commend the temper in which it is 
written. We allude more especially, as may 
be surmised, to the chapters relating to the dis- 
puted election of 1876. It would, of course, 
have been difficult, and perhaps impossible, for 
Dr. Bigelow, as a warm personal and political 
friend of Mr. Tilden, to have reviewed this 
question, on the merits of which honest and in- 
telligent men are still divided in accordance 
with their party proclivities, from any but the 
advocate's standpoint. But advocacy is not 
incompatible with sobriety of judgment and 
language. Dr. Bigelow's plea would, to our 
thinking, be more effective were it more mod- 
erate in its claims and less sweeping in its 
charges ; and it is very probable that not the 
least conspicuous result of his well-nigh whole- 
sale denunciation of the Republican leaders of 
1876 may be a revival of half-forgotten cam- 
paign slanders against Mr. Tilden. These 
strictures made, it should be added that Dr. 
Bigelow's statement of the Democratic case is, 
in point of logic and evidence, an undeniably 
strong one perhaps the strongest yet made ; 
and it is the more to be regretted that its tone 
tends rather to provoke recrimination than to 
invite discussion. 

Mr. Tilden was born at New Lebanon, N. Y., 
February 9, 1814. His father, Elam Tilden, 
a stanch Jeffersonian, an admirer of Jackson, 
and a life-long friend of Van Buren, seems to 
have been in a way the political oracle of the 
village. Young Tilden's political bent showed 
itself early. While other boys of his age were 
at tops and marbles, he was reading Jeffer- 
son's writings and taking an assertive (and un- 
rebuked) part in the discussions of his elders. 
Mr. W. C. Bryant used to tell, with much 
humor, of a visit of the Tildens to his office, 
and of the comical deference with which the 
father would refer to Samuel for his views, and 
of the austere deliberation with which those 
views were unfolded. " He appeared," said 
Mr. Bryant, " but for his size and dress, rather 
the eldest of the party." Mr. Tilden's actual 
schooling was limited. He entered Yale Col- 
lege in 1835, but ill-health prevented his grad-

uating. In 1838 he entered the New York 
University Law School, and in 1841 opened an 
office in New York where he soon secured a 
moderate practice. He had already made his 
debut as a political writer and speaker ; and by 
1844, when his warm friend and mentor Mr. 
Van Buren was defeated by Mr. Polk in the 
Democratic National Convention, he was a 
recognized force in his party. In 1848 the 
Democratic ranks were fatally split on the sla- 
very question ; and Mr. Tilden followed the 
Free Soil wing. The party schism, and the 
resulting election of .General Taylor, the Whig 
candidate, determined Mr. Tilden to avoid pol- 
itics and devote himself to his profession, in 
the pursuit of which he rapidly won fame and 
fortune. When, in 1856, the Republican party 
was formed to combat the extension of slavery, 
Mr. Tilden was pressed to join the organiza- 
tion ; but he declined, mainly for the reason 
that he foresaw that a Republican triumph at 
the polls meant civil war. Strongly opposed to 
slavery as an institution, he nevertheless clung 
to the old temporizing policy, trusting that 
time, the inherent superiority of free labor, and 
the changes to be wrought by the rapidly grow- 
ing immigration, would eventually uproot the 
evil. He accordingly voted against Mr. Fre- 
mont in 1856, and Mr. Lincoln in 1860. Mr. 
Tilden's apprehensions of a civil conflict were 
not generally shared in. A few days prior 
to the election of Mr. Lincoln, says Dr. Bige- 
low, "he came into the editorial rooms of the 
4 Evening Post,' looking very haggard and pre- 
occupied." 

" Intimate friends who chanced to be there at the 
time began to chaff him about the political situation. 
. . . Presently, as if suddenly filled with the spirit of 
prophecy, and in a tone of intense emotion, he exclaimed, 
' I would not have the responsibility of William Cullen 
Bryant and John Bigelow for all the wealth in the sub- 
treasury. If you have your way, civil war will divide 
this country, and you will see blood running like water 
in the streets of this city.' . . . Much as it would have 
grieved me, it would not have surprised me had I heard 
any time within ten days or ten hours that he was a 
raving lunatic." 

When, on the election of Mr. Lincoln, the 
storm broke, Mr. Tilden at once sided with 
the administration, his cooperation being- 
qualified, however, by a difference of opinion 
on certain points, mainly as to the conduct of 
the war and the methods of providing for its 
expenses. He was for no half-way measures. 
In a conversation at the war-meeting at General 
Dix's, in New York, he was heard to say that 

" The prevailing estimate of the war impending was 
entirely incorrect; that it could not be a small war;

that, instead of seventy-five thousand men which had 
been called out by the proclamation of April 15, five 
hundred thousand at least ou^ht to be enlisted two 
hundred and fifty thousand fur immediate service, and 
the rest to be put in camps of instruction; that it was 
idle to hope to get on, except at imnecessary sacrifice, 
without the advantages of discipline and without pre- 
paration commensurate with the territorial proportions 
of the belligerents." 

Mr. Tilden opposed the Fiat-money policy 
of Mr. Chase. What his own plan would have 
been is outlined in his Governor's message of 
1875: 

" If the federal government had paid out treasury 
notes not made a legal tender, in its own transactions 
whenever it was convenient, and redeemed them by the 
proceeds of loans and taxes on their presentation at a 
central point of commerce, and meanwhile had bor- 
rowed at the market rates for its bonds, secured by am- 
ple sinking funds, founded on taxation, and had supple- 
mented such loans by all necessary taxes, the sacrifice 
would not have been half that required by the false 
system adopted, perhaps the cost of the war would not 
have been half what it became." 

About 1867, when he was sent to the State 
Constitutional Convention, Mr. Tilden again 
became a looming factor in politics. By com- 
bating in that body a nefarious scheme for en- 
larging the Erie Canal, he took the first step 
in the long battle for reform which is his best 
title to distinction, and which an unsavory 
member of his party is said to have styled a 
policy of " pandering to the respectable 
classes." In 1870 he risked party disaster and 
his own political ruin by leading an attack on 
the Tweed Ring, holding that " a million of peo- 
ple were not to be given over to pillage to serve 
any party expediency, or to advance any views 
of State or National politics." To Mr. Tilden 
more than any other individual was due the 
downfall of the Ring, and the resulting inter- 
regnum of approximate judicial, legislative, 
and administrative honesty in the city of New 
York. The victory over Tammany led to Mr. 
Tilden's election to the Governorship in 1874 : 
and his prompt declaration of war on the Canal 
Ring, a corrupt organization embracing about 
an equal proportion of both parties, made it 
painfully clear to the raptorial elements in 
New York politics, not only that he proposed 
to continue at all costs his " pandering " policy, 
but that he meant to pursue the rogues of his 
own part} 7 no less vigorously than those of the 
opposition. The Canal Ring went down, as 
Tammany had gone down before it ; and the 
tremendous ovation received by Mr. Tilden on 
his subsequent tour through the " canal coun- 
ties " marked him as the inevitable candidate 
of his party at the ensuing presidential election. 



As Judge Blair phrased it, " he seemed the 
only arrow in the Democratic quiver." He had 
shown himself beyond cavil an able and a con- 
sistent champion of reform ; and what the peo- 
ple then wanted was, first and foremost, a re- 
form administration at Washington. That they 
had at that period ample reason for demanding 
it, will hardly be questioned. Mr. Tilden was 
nominated for the presidency at St. Louis, 
June 27, 1876 ; and it may be taken as a vir- 
tual tribute to his character that the irreproach- 
able Mr. Hayes had been chosen, over showier 
and perhaps abler aspirants, as the fittest man 
to oppose him. 

Reviewing the election controversy of 1876, 
we note the following general points : A total 
popular majority for Mr. Tilden (on his oppo- 
nents' showing) of 252,284 ; 184 undisputed 
electoral votes for Mr. Tilden, against 166 (al- 
lowing him the one disputed vote in Oregon) 
for Mr. Hayes the former candidate thus 
lacking one and the latter nineteen of a major- 
ity of the 369 electoral votes ; a disputed elec- 
tion in three States, South Carolina, Florida, 
and Louisiana, aggregating just the nineteen 
electoral votes needed by Mr. Hayes ; the dis- 
ordered condition of these three States, which 
were still under " reconstructed " governments 
in touch with the administration and backed by 
federal troops ; the establishment by the " re- 
constructed" governments of Returning Boards 
charged each with the duty of examining the 
vote of its State and throwing out the votes of 
counties in which there was evidence of fraud 
and intimidation ; the actual throwing out by 
the Boards of counties enough to reduce Mr. 
Tilden's admitted majority of the votes cast to a 
minority ; the consequent receipt at Washing- 
ton of two sets of returns from each State, one 
set claiming for Mr. Tilden, the other for Mr. 
Hayes ; the prospective deadlock, on counting 
the votes, in Congress, owing to the fact that 
the Senate was Republican and the House was 
Democratic ; the appointment of an Electoral 
Commission of fifteen members five from 
the Senate, five from the House, and five from 
the Supreme Court to canvass the returns 
and decide the issues ; and the ultimate hing- 
ing of the entire question on the casting vote 
of the odd Commissioner, Judge Bradley, a 
Republican, who, like his colleagues, voted in 
accord with his party, and probably (Dr. Bige- 
low to the contrary notwithstanding) with his 
judgment and conscience. The fundamental 
Democratic contention was that the Returning 
Boards were anomalous, illegal, and partisan 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



293 



bodies, and that their control of the elections 
was a virtual disf ranchisement of the people : 
the Republicans contended that, in the then 
condition of the South, the Boards were neces- 
sary to prevent force and fraud from carrying 
the day. Touching the action of the Electoral 
Commission, a competent observer, Mr. Bryce, 
says : " The legal questions were so difficult, 
and for the most part so novel, that it was pos- 
sible for a sound lawyer and honest man to 
take in each case either the view for which the 
Republicans or that for which the Democrats 
contended," in short that, as in the old quar- 
rel, the color of the shield depended on the stand- 
point of the observer. From this tamely ra- 
tional view of the case, Dr. Bigelow, convinced, 
it would seem, of the total depravity of Repub- 
lican human nature, in effect utterly dissents. 
He is not only certain that Mr. Tilden was 
elected and that Mr. Hayes was, in the old 
Greek sense, a tyrant, but he has no manner 
of doubt that the former was kept out of the 
White House by a shameless conspiracy, in- 
volving the gravest political crimes, shared in 
or connived at by almost every Republican 
leader of note from Mr. Hayes down to Mr. 
*' Bill " Chandler, and including Senators Sher- 
man and Chandler, Secretary Cameron, Stan- 
ley Mathews, General Garfield, Mr. Evarts, 
General Lew. Wallace, General Noyes, and 
so on, all of whom President Hayes subse- 
quently " recognized " except, indeed, Mr. 
" Bill " Chandler, who, " not receiving a prompt 
reward for his services, turned upon the chromo 
President he had hung up in the White House 
. . . and practically acknowledged that Hayes 
had never been elected President by the peo- 
ple." We regret to add that Dr. Bigelow by 
no means excludes the Supreme Court Com- 
missioners from his indictment even intimat- 
ing that one of them (unnamed) was actually 
" for sale " at a stated sum of -$200,000 ! As 
the author seems to have no evidence worth 
mentioning of the truth of this amazing story, 
we cannot commend his judgment in print- 
ing it. 

Dr. Bigelow devotes about a hundred pages 
to the story of the, way in which (according to 
his view) Mr. Tilden was robbed of the presi- 
dency. The plot, it seems, was hatched in the 
" Times " office (Republican), on the night of 
Nov. 7, when enough returns had come in to 
convince those present of Mr. Hayes's defeat. 
A leader virtually to that effect was on the press. 
At this juncture a note came from Chairman 
Barnum of the Democratic National Committee 



asking for news from Florida, Louisiana, and 
South Carolina. This query of the ill-starred 
Barnum was the spark that fired the train. It 
operated, says Dr. Bigelow (who never minces 
matters), " like an open basement window at 
night on a burglariously disposed passer-by." 
The possibilities of the situation an admitted 
close vote in States notoriously disordered and 
controlled by " reconstructed " governments, 
Returning Boards, and the like quasi-Republi- 
can agencies flashed at once on those present. 
They were not slow to act. A fresh, and 
mildly - jubilant, leader was prepared ; party 
chiefs were consulted in hot haste ; urgent, but 
diplomatic, telegrams were sent before day- 
break to the faithful in the pivotal States 
and the " conspiracy " that shortly involved 
in its meshes two future presidents, " leading 
national statesmen, cabinet ministers, and per- 
sons occupying seats in the highest judicial 
tribunal," was fairly under way. Of its pro- 
gress and outcome the author gives a detailed, 
dramatic, and, in its way, forcible account. In 
every move of the Republicans he sees an effort, 
not, as they claim, to secure, but to defeat, a 
fair count ; and the astonished reader is left to 
wonder how (on Dr. Bigelow's showing) all 
the virtue then extant in the country managed 
to get into one party, and all the vice inta the 
other. The foreign verdict is not unlikely to 
be, arcades ambo. Dr. Bigelow rests his case 
on Florida and Louisiana, where Mr. Tilden 
had indisputably a majority of the votes cast. 
He dwells on the gathering of the Republican 
clans in those States ; on the massing of troops ; 
on the free use of money ; on the promises of 
protection and "recognition" sown broadcast 
by Republican "workers" -notably by ex- 
Governor Noyes, " the alter ego of Mr. Hayes "; 
on the throwing out of Democratic precinct 
after precinct on the flimsiest of pretexts ; on 
the wholesale perjury and subornation of per- 
jury, forgery, doctoring of returns, etc., in the 
interests of Mr. Hayes : on the subsequent 
" recognition " by Mr. Hayes of men whose 
proper recognition would have been a term in 
the penitentiary ; and, on the whole, he draws 
a picture too lurid to be true, and too partisan 
to be effective with dispassionate readers. Mr. 
Tilden is often credited (as by Mr. Bryce) with 
inducing his friends to agree to the compromise 
expedient of the Electoral Commission, and 
thus sacrificing his ambition on the altar of 
peace and the common welfare. Dr. Bigelow 
shows that this is an error. Mr. Tilden was 
not apprised of the scheme till his party were

firmly committed to it : and even then he com- 
bated it as " a panic of pacificators," as an 
uncalled for and illegal method of deciding 
questions which the Constitution, impliedly, 
and settled precedent, had left to the arbitra- 
ment of Congress. 

Dr. Bigelow's book is exceedingly readable, 
and, as a biography, it leaves little to be de- 
sired - save on the old score of condensation. 
Mr. Tilden's character is well drawn through- 
out, the portrait justifying Whittier's view of 
him as one 

" Ambitious, cautious, yet the man 

To strike down fraud with resolute hand : 
A patriot, if a partisan, 
He loved his native land."

STUDIES OF GREAT UNIVERSITIES.* 



Dr. Paulsen's name on a title-page is a suf- 
ficient pledge of the value of any book in which 
it is found. In the present instance, the book 
is" a translation of the Introduction to the great 
work in two volumes that the Imperial German 
Government published to accompany its edu- 
cational exhibit at Chicago in 1893. The word 
" introduction " suggests only an approach to 
a subject ; but the whole work to which this one 
was prefixed was executed on such a broad 
scale as to permit, without sense of dispropor- 
tion, a comprehensive view of its special sub- 
ject. It is an outline, of course, but it is an 
outline that fills two hundred and forty pages, 
and is in itself well proportioned. 

The author begins with a brief chapter on 
the " General Character of the German Uni- 
versity," discriminating it sharply from the 
French Universities (facultes^ so called) on the 
one hand, and Oxford and Cambridge on the 
other. The centre of interest is contained in 
this paragraph : 

" If we fix our attention upon the inner nature of the 
German university, its particular character is plainly 
seen to be this: It is at once the workshop of scientific 
research, and an institution for the highest scientific in- 
struction ; and for general as well as for technical scien- 
tific instruction. Like the English universities, it offers 



*THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES : THEIR CHARACTER AND

a wider and deeper scientific training of a general na- 
ture this being in particular the task of the philosoph- 
ical faculty. Like the French faculties, it offers the 
technical training for the learned callings of the minis- 
try, the bench and bar, the higher civil service, and the 
office of teaching in the gymnasiums. But beyond this 
the German universities are something which neither 
French nor English universities are: the chief seats of 
scientific work in the country, and with that the nur- 
series of scientific research. According to the German 
conception, the university professor is at once teacher 
and scientific investigator, and the latter feature is the 
more prominent, so that we must in fact say: In Ger- 
many the scientific investigators are at the same time 
the teachers of the academic youth. As a necessary 
consequence, the academic instruction is above all 
strictly scientific, not the training for the practice of a 
profession, but the introduction to scientific insight and 
research, holding the most prominent place." 

There are exceptions to the rule that the 
most eminent savants are university profes- 
sors ; but this is the rule, nevertheless. "When, 
in Germany, we speak of a great scholar," 
says our author, " the question soon follows : 
At what university is he ? And if he is not at 
any university, we may safely assume that he 
regards it as a slight. So, on the other hand, if 
there is mention of a professor, the question 
is soon asked, ' What has he written ? What 
has he achieved in science ? ' ' 

The second chapter deals with the develop- 
ment of the German universities, the subject 
being divided into two heads. Under the Mid- 
dle Ages the topics are : Origin, Method of 
Foundation, Organization, Attendance, Con- 
trol of Students, Teachers, Courses of Instruc- 
tion, Subjects and Method of Instruction. Un- 
der Modern Times they are : The Renaissance 
and the Reformation, the University Sectarian 
and Dependent upon the Established Church, 
the Eighteenth Century, and the Nineteenth 
Century. While the treatment here is neces- 
sarily pragmatical and dry, still it is broad in 
grasp and not unrelieved by luminous ideas. 
The student of educational progress is likely to 
watch with keenest interest the slow disengage- 
ment of the universities from the hand of au- 
thority and the establishment of Lehrfreiheit 
and Lernfreiheit. To Halle, founded in 1694, 
is ascribed " the glory of being the first really 
modern university, for it was here that the lih- 
ertas philosophandi on which the modern uni- 
versity rests, the principle of untrammelled 
teaching, first took firm root." The signifi- 
cance of the change is thus marked : 

" The older system of university instruction had 
started in each case from the assumption that truth was 
given, that education consisted in the transmission of 
this truth, and that it was the duty of the controlling 
powers to take heed that no false doctrine be imparted. 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



295 



The newer system starts from the assumption that truth 
must be sought, and that it is the proper task of edu- 
cation to give the skill and the impulse necessary to the 
search." 

The three succeeding chapters, " The Ger- 
man Universities in their Relation to the State, 
to the Church, and to the Community," " Teach- 
ers and Teaching in the University," and "Stu- 
dents and the Pursuit of Study," embrace the 
topics of greatest living interest. The reader 
hitherto unacquainted with the subject will find 
the first of these three chapters throwing im- 
portant light on the great demonstrations made 
by professor* and students at Fredericksrhue 
on the eightieth birthday of Prince Bismarck. 

The remarks on lectures (Chapter IV.) and 
on over-specialization (Chapter VI.) are of the 
greatest practical interest to American educa- 
tors at the present time. " Of course," says 
Dr. Paulsen, dealing with the second topic, 
" there is no possibility of retrogression in the 
division of labor, upon which depend the mighty 
advances of scientific research. We are called 
upon, however, to oppose the spirit of special- 
ism, of over-narrow self-confinement, and small- 
souled satisfaction with one's self ; and every 
one who belongs to a university is likewise 
called upon to help along the opposition." 

The remarks made, passim, concerning the 
relative positions of the faculties are of pecu- 
liar interest, furnishing no mean gauge of the 
movements of thought at different times. Thus, 
in the period of Church domination, which 
closed at the middle of the seventeenth century, 
the theological faculty still held " the first place, 
and had gained greatly in real importance ; for 
theological study had now become, what it was 
not by any means in the Middle Ages, a neces- 
sity for the whole body of clergy a natural 
consequence of the fact that doctrine made a 
vast advance and prominence as compared with 
ritual, first in the Protestant world and thereby 
also in the Catholic." " The faculty of law, 
also, grew in size and importance, keeping pace 
with the development of the modern state and 
of civil service." " The faculty of medicine had 
less growth to show ; it remained the weakest 
down to the nineteenth century." " The philo- 
sophical faculty, as thefacultus artium was now 
called, retained in the main its former position, 
continuing to form the connecting link between 
the schools below it, which taught only the lan- 
guages, and the faculties above it, which gave 
special scientific training ; its object was to 
supplement the school instruction in general or 
philosophical science." In the present century 
" we remark a change in the position of the 



faculty of philosophy. Its task used to be the 
general scientific preparation for special pro- 
fessional study in one of the so-called upper fac- 
ulties ; it has now become a professional school 
for a particular profession : that of teaching 
in the higher schools." With the progress of 
time, the teacher's office has been dissociated 
from the ecclesiastical profession ; or, as our 
author remarks : " Nowadays teaching has be- 
come an independent profession for life, and 
since the middle of this century, changes to 
church positions have been extremely rare." 

These few excerpts will perhaps suffice to 
whet the interest of the reader. Professor Perry 
has done his work well, adding frequent notes 
and somewhat expanding the appendices. Dr. 
Nicholas Murray Butler contributes an intro- 
duction on " The Relation of the German Uni- 
versities to the Problems of Higher Education 
in the United States." He thinks over special- 
ization threatens our universities as well as 
those of Germany. He observes : " Perhaps 
the division of labor cannot be carried too far 
for the value of the product, but it can be car- 
ried too far for the good of the laborer." And 
in education, it should be remembered, the la- 
borer is the great end in view. Of all modes of 
approach to the German universities known to 
us, this book is the best that is accessible to the 
scholarly English reader. 

The second book on our list derives much of 
its interest and value from its author. Mr. 
Hill is an Oxonian of standing, as well as a 
writer of standing. An extended account of 
our oldest and foremost university, such as this 
book is, coming from such a source, could not 
fail to attract attention. Besides going care- 
fully through the standard histories and the 
official documents, Mr. Hill has read many 
books written by Harvard men, and books 
written about them, and has spent time enough 
in Cambridge to become familiar with the spirit 
of the place. He has brought together a great 
amount of interesting information, which he 
has arranged, clothed, and commented upon 
in an interesting manner. But the discrimin- 
ating reader will be most interested in the book 
as the judgment of an Oxonian of high char- 
acter upon Harvard University. This phase 
of it will be the more persistent to his mind, 
because the writer is constantly making compar- 
isons between Harvard and Oxford. His atti- 
tude is neither censorious criticism nor fulsome 
praise. He does not hesitate to lash Harvard 
severely for her failings, as her record on the 
slavery question ; but, on the whole, he is ap- 



296 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



preeiative and sympathetic, and his general 
view cannot fail to be gratifying to Harvard 
men. We call attention to one or two points 
more specifically. 

After speaking with much enthusiasm of the 
bountiful stream of contributions that con- 
stantly flows into the Harvard treasury, Mr. 
Hill writes : 

" We of the ancient universities may well look with 
wonder, and even with a certain touch of sadness, on 
these great doings. Why does not the same stream of 
bounty flow on Oxford and Cambridge? Why, when 
they make known their needs, and their needs often 
are great, does not a generous benefactor at once 
arise ? Balliol College, as a memorial to its famous Mas- 
ter, is attempting, this very year, by public subscrip- 
tion, to enlarge its foundation so that it may do even 
greater things than it has already done. The sum which 
it has received is not one-tenth part of what this Amer- 
ican University receives almost every year; and yet less 
than half a century ago the students at Harvard were 
not twice as numerous as those of Balliol at the present 
time. In Cambridge, by the great fall in rents, the 
salary of the Downing Professor of Medicine has dwin- 
dled to two hundred pounds a year. The post lately 
became vacant by the resignation of the Professor. ' It 
will be somewhat difficult,' wrote The Times, ' to obtain 
a suitable successor, owing to the fact that the profes- 
sorship is most insufficiently endowed.' All the fame 
that Cambridge ha's gained by her great School of Med- 
icine apparently does nothing for her. In the American 
Cambridge, such an insufficiency in so important a pro- 
fessorship could scarcely exist; it certainly would not 
last long." 

Only one reason is assigned for this marked 
disparity. " Oxford is wronged by the men 
who, even after all the reforms which have 
been made, are overpaid for the work they do." 
Mr. Hill does not think Oxford teachers, as a 
class, are overpaid ; " much of the work done 
in the Universities is but ill requited "; " many 
a college tutor measures out his labor, not by 
what he receives, but by a noble zeal for learn- 
ing, and for the welfare of his pupils "; " those 
who are overpaid are few in number compared 
with the whole body, but they are conspicuous 
by their position." He assures us that the 
greater, and the new, endowments which are so 
conspicuously needed, " will flow in but slowly, 
if they flow in at all, so long as it is known in 
the country that large sums are still wasted, 
as wasted they most certainly are. No one can 
reproach Harvard with an ill-use of her funds," 
he says : " no one, I believe, can point to a sin- 
gle man who does not at least do a fair day's 
work for a fair day's pay." 

It is not improbable that some readers will 
turn with most interest to the pages of the 
chapter that deals with Harvard's relations to 
the education of woman. Here Mr. Hill deals 



in severe censure, pointing out that Harvard 
has been more timid and gingerly in her treat- 
ment of women than the Oxford colleges. Rad- 
cliffe College cannot be the goal. The Cor- 
poration and Overseers have not been able to 
screw their courage to the point of giving de- 
serving women the University degree ; " but 
they are much more than half-way across the 
stream, and onwards they must go." He con- 
tinues : 

" There is fear, we are told, that the full Harvard de- 
gree would attract so large a number of women that 
the new college would be overwhelmed. I am reminded 
how nearly sixty years ago our Postmaster-General op- 
posed the scheme of penny postage, because the num- 
ber of letters would be so large that the walls of the 
postoffice would burst. The letters, he seemed to think, 
should be kept down to the size of the building, and 
not the building enlarged to the number of the letters." 

Our third book will first attract attention by 
its pictorial features. It abounds in attractive 
illustrations, some of which, or perhaps all, 
have been already used in another place. The 
letter-press is also meritorious. Professor Nor- 
ton writes of Harvard, Professor Hadley of 
Yale, Professor Sloane of Princeton, and Pro- 
fessor Matthews of Columbia. The illustra- 
tions deal with the several periods of history 
impartially ; the writers, too, make some use of 
historical materials, but they have rightly con- 
ceived it to be their business to present the 
Universities as they are, alive and growing, 
rather than the processes that have produced 
them. One gets a new idea of the influence of 
these old institutions when he finds Professor 
Sloane writing : " While the Princeton which 
is still in New Jersey does not equal in num- 
bers the Yale in New Haven, or the Harvard 
in Cambridge, she does not yield to them in her 
wider influence, for she has been the mother of 
many colleges, about twenty-five directly and 
indirectly, which are now scattered from Rhode 
Island for Brown University is in a sense her 
daughter to California." And again : " The 
history of the Southern Atlantic and Gulf 
States might almost be written in the biogra- 
phies of Princeton graduates." 

The three books are all excellent examples 
of the bookmaker's art. The second one, like 
the third, is amply and beautifully illustrated.

THE REVIVAL, OF THE ELIZABETHANS.* 

In spite of all changes of literary fashion, 
the Elizabethans hold their own. The roman- 
ticists brought them into vogue, but they seem 
destined bravely to outlive the modern classic 
reaction and the vicissitudes of the Isms. Good 
taste, like many other good things, goes on 
widening with the process of the suns, and the 
*polia opima of literature in the long run man- 
age to survive the conflicts of the critics and 
the battles of the schools. 

The Elizabethan lyrics still offer a rich field 
for the gleaners. Professor Schelling's recent 
volume of selections from these lyrics, for the 
" Athenaeum Press series," is a model of good 
editing. The chronological arrangement of the 
poems is an excellent idea, the notes are suffi- 
cient for the purpose, and the introduction is 
an admirable and judicious contribution to the 
criticism of the subject. The editor discusses 
with lucidity, and with an excellent sense of 
proportion, the lyric, its nature and definition, 
the chief periods in the history of the Eliza- 
bethan lyric, the supremacy of the pastoral 
mode, the sonnet-sequences, the miscellanies 
and the song-books, the lyric work and influence 
of Spenser, Donne, and Jonson, and the vari- 
ous Elizabethan lyrical measures. In one in- 
stance only must I take the liberty of disagree- 
ing with Professor Schelling. Only by a very 
lax interpretation of the phrase can the 
" Faerie Queene " be cited as an illustration of 
the prevalence of the pastoral mode in Eliza- 
bethan literature, as a " pastoral romance 
. . . allegorized and told in verse." There is 
a considerable pastoral element in the " Faerie 
Queene," but the tone of the poem as a whole 
is hardly that of the pastoral, or even of the 
pastoral allegorized. 

It is a matter of some surprise that Spenser's 
lyric poems have never before been edited in 
separate form. Professor Palgrave has sup-

plied an admirable general commentary upon 
them fin the edition of the Spenser Society) , 
and Mr. Rhys's short introduction is appre- 
ciative and apt. The minor poems, however, 
still lack the necessary annotations (such as are 
supplied in overabundance for the " Faerie 
Queene "), and the full and detailed study of 
their sources and literary relations. A volume 
to include such materials would make an admir- 
able addition to the " AthenaBum Press Series." 
Mr. Rhys's edition, as it stands, is nevertheless 
an excellent idea. Spenser's rank as a lyric 
poet as a poet of " the greater lyric," the 
more sustained lyric is among the very first. 
Mr. Rhys is right in insisting upon this ; he is 
right also in insisting upon Spenser's great in- 
fluence, and right in reprinting the beautiful 
" Shepherd's Calender " in its entirety ; but he 
is less right, perhaps, in insisting on the iden- 
tity of Spenser with the mysterious commenta- 
tor " E. K." Spenser's archaisms no longer 
offer any serious difficulty to the modern reader, 
with his constantly enlarging vocabulary of his- 
toric English ; we are passing out from the 
shadow of Wordsworth's theory of poetic dic- 
tion and of poetic theme : the Renaissance 
model and the neo-Romantic model in pastoral 
poetry are equally interesting to us ; conse- 
quently nothing any longer stands in the way 
of our appreciation of the exquisite charm of 
a poem which breathes throughout the fresh- 
ness and magic of such verse as this : 

" But friendly Faeries, met with many Graces, 
And lightfoot Nymphs, can chase the lingering night, 
With heydeguys and trimly trodden traces ; 
Whilst sisters nine, which dwell on Parnass height, 
Do make them music for their more delight ; 
And Pan himself, to kiss their crystal faces, 
Will pipe and dance, when Phrebe shineth bright : 
Such peerless pleasures have we in these places." 

Dr. Grosart, in bringing together Spenser's 
love poetry, has exercised a freer principle of 
selection with a less happy result. It is highly 
interesting to read all of a great poet's utter- 
ances on the unending theme of love ; but one 
may doubt the wisdom of subordinating the 
purely poetical motives of Spenser's verse in 
this vein to the personal interest and occasion 
of it, as Dr. Grosart does. Dr. Grosart over- 
emphasizes the personal interest in the case of 
Greene also. All the critical good-will in the 
world cannot raise Greene above his natural 
level of amiable mediocrity and picturesque 
pathos. He is remembered for a few occasional 
felicities, for a slight vein of grace and fresh- 
ness that appears here and there in his plays 
and prose-tales, and for his unhappy career.

Otherwise, as Mr. Lowell says, " he is naught," 
and the cause of better men is always injured 
by the attempt to push forward inferior work 
into the notice of the public. 

The edition of Drummond's Poems in " The 
Muses Library " is a valuable addition to that 
excellent series, and the editor deserves praise 
for the care with which he has traced out the 
poet's literary relations and his obligations to 
his sources. Drummond is an interesting fig- 
ure among the later Elizabethans, a gentle 
and fervid spirit, "a polite and verdant 
genius " is the characterization of him by Ed- 
ward Phillips, Milton's nephew, a royalist 
and country gentleman, a scholar and traveller, 
but first of all a poet, Platonist, and man of 
letters. Nature plays no small part in his verse, 
and he was a lover of country life : " Ut hon- 
esto otio quiesceret " was the inscription upon 
his house at Hawthornden. " The great ex- 
cellence of Drummond is unaffected feeling 
and unaffected language," says a writer in "The 
Eetrospective Review "; and Mr. Ward, his 
latest editor, lays much stress overmuch 
stress, perhaps upon the note of sincerity and 
of personal feeling manifested in his early love- 
sonnets and madrigals. As to his language, it 
is sufficient to observe that Drummond was a 
disciple on the one hand of Marino and on the 
other of Sir Philip Sidney ; although his style 
is freer from conceits and from affectations 
than might have been expected under the cir- 
cumstances. He has couplets that point to the 
school of Waller, and in style he lies some- 
where between Sidney and Donne. His verse 
is full of colors, especially saffron, azure, ver- 
milion, amber, rose, and sapphire. Fountains 
and flowers, sky and clouds, stars and moon 
and night, merles and nightingales, faraway 
geographical names such as Ganges, Hydaspes, 
Ister, and Tanais, music and odors and dreams, 
enter largely into his effects. The brother- 
hood in the faith of Romanticism which con- 
nects Browne and Drummond with Keats and 
Shelley Drummond, like Shelley, was a Pla- 
tonist is neither faint nor fantastic. 

Mr. Ward's introduction, largely drawn from 
Professor Masson's Life of Drummond, is ad- 
equate ; but for the purposes of a " Muses Li- 
brary " follows its original too closely in the 
amount of space devoted to the political aspects 
of Drummond's career, and, like so much of 
modern special criticism, it is affected with the 
vice of exaggeration. Moreover, in an edition 
designed for the general reader rather than for 
the scholar alone, all of the merely unclean in 



Drummond's verse it is not much might 
better have been omitted. We rejoice, how- 
ever, that Mr. Ward has seen fit to include 
among the poems Drummond's real master- 
piece, the prose essay entitled " The Cypress 
Grove," a production worthy of Sir Thomas 
Browne eloquent, Platonic, of a high imag- 
ination, and written in a style of exceptional 
fluency and delightful cadence. Drummond's 
poetical style also is not without frequent felic- 
ities ; but he resembles the poets of the meta- 
physical school in generally affecting a slightly 
uneven and staccatic rhythm, licentious in met- 
rical transposition, although founded upon a 
consistent time-and-thought logic of its own. 
In his own epitaph, he is the author of two 
perfect lines : 

" Here Damon lies, whose songs did sometime grace 
The murmuring Esk ; may roses shade the place." 

FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER. 



THE ART CRITICISM OF ARISTOTL.E.* 



Some hundred and fifty years ago the aver- 
age critic prepared himself for his task by 
studying the " Poetics " of Aristotle and the 
different metempsychoses which that work had 
taken in Longinus, Horace, Vida, and Boileau, 
in order to know the correct principles upon 
which to give orthodox judgment. Nowadays 
the average critic is more of a nihilist or an- 
archist. In the first place, he does n't want to 
give orthodox judgments ; and in the second 
place, he does n't busy himself much about cor- 
rect principles. If he pay any attention at 
all to " the Stagirite," it is rather as a matter 
of historic curiosity than for any other reason. 

Aristotle's " Poetics " is, however, not only 
a work of great importance in the history of 
criticism ; it is very stimulating even at pres- 
ent, and one feels it all the more after reading 
Professor Butcher's edition. Perhaps it is not 
in any sense, as a brilliant if erratic critic would 
have us believe, " a perfect little work of aes- 
thetic criticism." But it presents its subject 
in a manner so concise and yet so suggestive, 
that it always causes one to think. Mr. John 
Mdrley regarded it as a disgrace to human in- 
telligence that men should have for so many 
centuries interpreted Aristotle's dicta on trag- 
edy, instead of studying tragedies at first hand. 
He was not so very far wrong ; but the fact is

significant of the character of the " Poetics." 
Readers of " Some Aspects of Greek Genius" 
have for some time looked forward to Profes- 
sor Butcher's promised edition, and now that 
it has appeared it is fortunately found to be in 
no way disappointing. It presents a critical 
text with a translation, and then an exposition 
of Aristotle's theory of Poetry and Fine Art. 
This last part, which takes up two-thirds of a 
good-sized octavo, is an expansion and remodel- 
ling of the chapters on the subject in the earlier 
work just mentioned. It is not merely a criti- 
cism of the " Poetics," but a statement of the 
aesthetic doctrine to be found throughout Aris- 
totle's writings. One might perhaps think 
(having recollection of eighteenth century dog- 
matism about Unities, Fable, and the like) 
that a discussion of Aristotle's theory of poetry 
would be somewhat dry and lifeless. But this 
book is one of the most vitalizing to one's 
thoughts on art that has for some time ap- 
peared. Partly this is due to the pregnant 
thought of Aristotle himself, but in no small 
measure to the leavening power of his com- 
mentator. Those who read with delight " Some 
Aspects of Greek Genius " will find in this en- 
larged essay the same qualities, only a little 
riper, perhaps still more suggestive. 

We may mention one or two cases in point. 
The discussion of music as an imitative art, in 
the second chapter, is one which, in the light 
of musical theory at present, is full of interest. 
Aristotle could have had no conception of the 
power of music as developed in the last two 
centuries, and when he spoke of the ethical 
quality of music he must have had in mind 
something very different from the views of the 
advanced Wagnerian. But there is sufficient 
parallel to give life to the theory. In the same 
chapter, a remark which brings up a modern 
idea is that " Art . . . moving in a world of 
images and appearances, and creating after a 
pattern existing, in the mind, must be skilled 
in the use of illusion." The nature of illusion 
in general, and of artistic illusion in particular, 
has only of late years come to be the object of 
accurate study. But the regarding of a work 
of art as a cause, instead of merely an effect, 
and the investigation of the manner in which 
its own effects are produced, is sure to bring 
forth good results. Professor Butcher's dis- 
cussion of the katharsis, in which he develops 
the idea of Bernays, has also its current inter- 
est in view of the present popularity of novels 
of fierce emotion and stirring adventure in an 
age when daily life offers little vent for some 



of the wilder and more elemental passions. 
Many other instances might be noted, but these 
will be sufficient to give an idea of the work. 
One finishes the book with increased admira- 
tion for the " Poetics." When Professor Butcher 
says of Aristotle's conception of the tragic hero, 
that it is incomplete and inadequate, but that 
" it contains profound truth and a capacity for 
adaptation beyond what was immediately pres- 
ent to the mind of the writer," we feel that he 
is characterizing the whole treatise.

SOME APPRECIATIONS OF SIDNEY 

IjANIER.* 



In the little volume of " Select Poems of 
Sidney Lanier," editorial taste, insight, and 
discrimination are admirably blended with care- 
ful inquiry, minute accuracy, and painstaking 
labor. Barring a little stiffness in the excellent 
Introduction, the work is of a really high order 
throughout. The selections are among the 
choicest products of Lanier's art, and admirably 
illustrative of the range and power of his genius. 
The Notes are especially helpful and worthy of 
praise. By every right, Dr. Galloway should love 
Sidney Lanier. Of the same State, from the 
same South, with kindred tastes, the younger 
student of English was strongly drawn to the 
gifted poet-musician whose life, so heroic, so 
beautiful, so sad, still rests as a benediction on the 
great university with which his later years were 
connected. Even yet, his person, as described 
by Mr. Stedman, attracts the reader : " . . . 
the Southerner, nervous and eager, with dark 
hair and silken beard, features delicately 
moulded, pallid complexion, hands of the slen- 
der, white, artistic type." His inner life was 
still more delicate, refined, and beautiful. He 
was the true knight, sans peur, sans reproche. 

" His song was only singing aloud, 
His work a singing with his hand." 

" And for my part," says his editor, " I am as 
grateful for his noble private life as for his 
distinguished public work." 

But his was not a goodly heritage. Born 
with the divine gift of music in his soul, he was 
cast among a people who held it unmanly to be 
a musician. Born with the divine gift of song, 
and early manifesting intense longing for

knowledge, he was " cabined, cribbed, confined, 
bound in " to a life which offered no stimulus 
to the exercise of the gift, scanty appreciation 
of or sympathy with it, and meagre facilities 
for the acquisition of learning. All these things 
are brought out in a pathetically eloquent let- 
ter to his father, after he had determined to 
devote himself to music and literature. 

" My dear father, think how, for twenty years, through 
poverty, through pain, through weariness, through sick- 
ness, through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical 
college and of a bare army and then of an exacting 
business life, through all the discouragements of being 
wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary 
ways, I say, think how, in spite of all these depress- 
ing circumstances and of a thousand more which I could 
enumerate, these two figures of music and poetry have 
steadily kept in my heart, so that I could not banish 
them. Does it not seem to you as to me, that I begin 
to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees 
of these two sublime arts, after having followed them 
so long and so humbly, and through so much bitterness ? " 

Sidney Lanier reminds me of no other En- 
glish poet so much as of John Keats. It is not 
Lanier's manner or style ; for these recall Brown- 
ing far too much. But he and Keats had each 
received a wondrous poetic gift. Each followed 
Solomon's direction, " Get learning, get un- 
derstanding," recognizing that the road lay 
" through application, study, and thought." 
Each had had the chord of life so worn to a 
slender thread as to beget the ever-increasing 
dread that any intense feeling or ardor of cre- 
ative imagination would suddenly snap it asun- 
der. The American, it seems to me, did not 
realize as distinctly as did the English poet the 
truth that " the Genius of poetry must work 
out its own salvation in man. It cannot be 
matured by law and precept." Loving the 
principle of beauty in all things, and with an 
eye single to her service, Keats could say not 
only 

" Beauty is truth, truth beauty," 

but also, 

" A thing of beauty is a joy forever." 

Does any of the finer poetic principles ever 
permit the poet to work according to a con- 
scious theory ? 

Why, then, was the English poet able to 
reach results at twenty -five which the South- 
erner had not attained at thirty -nine ? The 
chief reason, I believe, was in the surroundings 
of the two men. To Keats was given a literary 
atmosphere, the right books at the right time, 
the friend to listen and to encourage, the select 
few, clear of vision and stout of heart, whose 
direct gaze, fixed purpose, and lofty achieve- 
ment revealed the fact that there is such a place 



as Mount Parnassus in the universe. Know- 
ledge, literary friends, literary methods, a lit- 
erary atmosphere, these all came into Lan- 
ier's life, but too late, I cannot but think. He 
became a rare discerner of thought, as well as 
a passionate lover of beauty, a fine critic and 
an original thinker, but never the really great 
poet. I would not go so far as with Mr. Gosse 
to say, " I find a painful effort, a strain and 
rage, the most prominent qualities in every- 
thing he wrote." Still less would I agree with 
Mr. Thayer in saying, " As a master of melo- 
dious metre, only Tennyson, and he not often, 
has equalled Lanier "; and still less with that 
English critic who declares that " Lanier's vol- 
ume has more of genius than all the poems of 
Poe, or Longfellow, or Lowell (the humorous 
poems excepted)", and who considers Lanier 
" the most original of all American poets, and 
more original than any England has produced 
for the last thirty years." Our age has pro- 
duced a special kind of enthusiasm which seems 
bent upon creating an order or rank of men of 
genius " who require something little short of 
genius on the part of others to recognize the 
special qualities which really distinguish them." 
Lanier's life was indeed a true poem. " He 
was as spotless as the ' Lady of Christ's,' and 
infinitely more lovable." But his poems are 
not " simple, sensuous, impassioned." Cole- 
ridge maintained that all good poetry was 
untranslatable into words of the same lan- 
guage without injury to the sense : in other 
words, perfect thought or feeling wedded to per- 
fect form and expression. In more than one 
poem, Poe succeeded in achieving this ; Lanier 
never in any, throughout. How rarely do we 
find a line or a stanza that imbeds itself in the 
memory. This felicity of speech, with Poe, as 
with Coleridge, was an acquisition. This lucid- 
ity was remarkable in Keats, as in other poets 
who have left us a perfect specimen of their 
art. That Lanier endeavored to exert his imag- 
ination to the utmost, to indulge in that exci- 
tation of feeling which is necessary to this 
peculiar felicity of choice, cannot be doubted. 
He it was who said that " the artist shall put 
forth, humbly and lovingly, and without bitter- 
ness against opposition, the very best and high- 
est that is within him, utterly regardless of 
contemporary criticism." Was he thinking 
more of the music of his verse or, rather, the 
music which according to his own theory should 
blend with his words than of the exquisite 
polish and nice selection of phrase which con- 
summate art alone can give?

Sidney Lanier, then, though he reminds us 
here and there of Emerson, of Browning, and 
of Swinburne, essayed to give artistic form to 
his own thoughts and feelings, to sing his own 
song. But either sufficient time was not al- 
lowed, or fortune did not permit him to arrive 
at that individuality by which the great poets 
are instantly recognized. Limited, then, as I 
believe he is, in regard to simplicity, to spon- 
taneity, to individuality, to passion, and to per- 
fection, he cannot be called " indisputably a 
great poet," though he does possess decided 
originality and a real poetic endowment. With 
this understanding, I can heartily endorse Dr. 
Galloway's estimate : 

"In technique he was akin to Tennyson; in love of 
beauty and lyric sweetness, to Keats and Shelley; in 
love of nature, to Wordsworth; and in spirituality, to 
Ruskin, the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls 
temporarily having bodies; to Milton, 'God-gifted organ- 
voice of England,' and to Browning, 'subtlest assertor 
of the soul in song.' To be sure, Lanier's genius is not 
equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned, but I 
venture to believe that it is of the same order, and, 
therefore, deserving of lasting remembrance."'

BRIEFS ON 



BOOKS. 



4 book A chatty, matterful little book, " not 

to delight unworthy the perusal of most an- 

the angler. glers," as old Izaak's title-page has it, 

is Mr. R. B. Marston's "Walton and Some Earlier 
Fishing Writers " (Armstrong). The author, as the 
elect know, is editor of " The Fishing Gazette," a 
collector of rare Waltons, and a practical brother of 
the angle withal, whom Mr. Piscator himself might 
have been glad to fall in with on " a line May morn- 
ing." The Common Father of all Anglers is natur- 
ally Mr. Marston's chief figure ; and seven out of 
the thirteen chapters are given to him and his mag- 
num opus. The earlier writers, however, are not 
neglected, such pre-Waltonian worthies as Piers of 
Fulham, Dame Juliana Berners, Leonard Mascall, 
John Dennys, Gervase Markham, etc., being duly 
noticed and their not very important productions 
described and listed. In addition to his comments 
on fishing books and authors, Mr. Marston draws 
occasionally on his own piscatorial experiences, and 
he gives, moreover, some practical hints and bits of 
information as to prized editions of the " Angler " 
which we commend to raw collectors. Imprimis, 
Mr. Marston lays down the sound general princi- 
ple : " Beware of taking to collect books on angling." 
For, he feelingly adds, "you will find yourself be- 
come so attached to the fascinating hobby that you 
would, if necessary, pawn the shirt off your back to 
obtain some coveted edition." A snare against 
which buyers are specially warned is " the uncom- 



monly clever spurious editions of Walton, made by 
the aid of photography in Germany." That this 
swindling game is worth the candle is attested by 
the fact that a perfect copy of Walton's first edition 
has been known to bring as high as 310 the 
buyer thereof being (to all other appearances) a 
man " clothed and in his right mind." The vagaries 
of the confirmed Waltonian are curious. One Higgs, 
for instance, a pious Vandal, had his pet copy bound 
in boards that were ripped off the door of Cotton's 
fishing-house, " where he was sure old Izaak's hand 
must have touched it." This copy afterwards sold 
for 63. " Walton's coffin," adds our author, "would 
not be safe from some of his ' admirers.'" Apropos 
of high-priced editions, Mr. Marston says that " all 
good Waltons go to America." Nor is this fact al- 
ways relished by the Briton the author relating 
that he recently bought a copy of the second edition 
under the owner's express stipulation that it was 
not to cross the water. " I do not see," he said, 
"why all our rarest books should go to America." 
In his chapter on later editions of Walton, Mr. 
Marston notes a German one, " Der Vollkommene 
Angler," which, judging from passages cited, must 
be nearly as funny as the famous Portuguese phrase- 
book. Comically enough, the translator warns his 
readers against " a certain heaviness " in his author ; 
after which he proceeds to lighten him up as fol- 
lows : " Ich bin wahrhaftig sehr erfreut Sie getrof- 
fen 7,u haben. . . . Lassen Sie uns keine Zeit mit 
Reden verschwenden, sondern uns sofort der Jagd 
ansschliessen. Kommen Sie, meiu ehrenwehrter 
Venator, beeilen wir uns, und machen wir, dass wir 
fortkommen " and so on, with an elephantine at- 
tempt to mimic Izaak's artless prattle that is most 
diverting. Not content with " lightening " his au- 
thor, the conscientious Teuton often corrects him, 
in this style : " Dieser Paragraph und der vorherge- 
hende sind mit bllihendem und handgreiflichem 
Unsinn angefiillt." Mr. Marston's little book should 
not be overlooked by those interested in its theme. 



Essays on 

Scandinavian 

literature. 



Professor Boyesen's " Essays on 
Scandinavian Literature " (Scrib- 
ner) comprises chapters on Ander- 
sen and Tegne*r, Herrer Bjornson. Kielland, Lie, 
and Brandes, and " Contemporary Danish Litera- 
ture." Another volume, to include discussions of 
Runeberg and Oehlenschlaeger, will follow the pres- 
ent one before very long. The Ibsen commentary, 
published last year, belongs with this group of studies, 
all of which may be regarded, the author tells us, 
as among the results of a cherished but abandoned 
plan to write a systematic history of Scandinavian 
letters for the English reader. In the volume be- 
fore us, Herr Bjornson gets, as he deserves, the 
foremost place, and almost half the total number of 
pages. The essay is, for the most part, a running 
commentary on the plays and novels of the great 
Norwegian, vigorous in characterization, highly 
readable and entertaining, but nowhere producing 
the impression of a finished study. Mr. Boyesen

writes too much and too rapidly to do the best work 
that he is capable of, and his style often degener- 
ates into mere journalism. Will it be believed that, 
speaking of Herr Lie, and describing him as a Jekyll- 
and-Hyde sort of person, the author uses such lan- 
guage as this : " From that day the Finnish Hyde 
in Jonas was downed and reduced to permanent 
subjection " ? The essays on Dr. Brandes and 
Bishop Tegne'r are perhaps the most satisfactory of 
the collection, and we should perhaps add the chap- 
ter on Hans Christian Andersen, since the greater 
part of it was originally written for THE DIAL. 
Certainly we owe Mr. Boyesen no slight debt of 
gratitude for his persistent efforts to help our pub- 
lic to know something of Scandinavian literature. 
That literature, if we may consider its three branches 
as forming a single product, is only out-ranked by 
the three culture-literatures of England, France, and 
Germany. No other modern literature, these three 
excepted, has a greater claim upon our attention 
than that which includes the names of Holberg and 
Oehlenschlaeger, of Runeberg and Tegne'r, of Herr 
Bjb'rnson and Dr. Ibsen. 

To the " International Humor " ser- 
ies (Scribner) are now added " The 
Humor of Ireland," edited by D. J. 
O'Donoghue, and " The Humor of Spain," edited 
by Susette M. Taylor. Each of the volumes con- 
tains an Introduction. Of these, Mr. O'Donoghue's 
is something over-long, and (taking his own anthol- 
ogy as a test, and not counting the extracts from 
such Anglo-Irishmen as Swift, Steele, Sterne, and 
Goldsmith, whose humor is individual rather than 
national, and is at any rate as much English as 
Irish) something over-laudatory. Irish fun is better 
spoken than printed. In print we lose the flash, 
the unexpectedness of the repartee a form of wit 
in which the Celt is facile princeps. Lost, too, are 
the personal accompaniments : the droll face, the 
sly leer, the brogue, the indefinable something in 
the Hibernian make-up that renders Pat the world 
over, like Falstaff, " the cause that wit is in other 
men." It is rather surprising, as Mr. O'Donoghue 
says, that the Irish, under such depressing condi- 
tions, should have evolved a national humor at all ; 
and we agree with him that "many countries with 
far more reason for uninterrupted good - humor, 
with much less cause for sadness, would be hard 
put to it to show an equally valuable contribution to 
the world's lighter literature." The present collec- 
tion is a fairly representative one. There is a 
thought too much, perhaps, of the inevitable potheen 
and shillelah, and the boisterous " Whack Bubba- 
boo " element generally ; but the better writers, 
Lover, Maginn, Lever, O'Keefe, Halpine, etc., are 
not slighted. Of a decidedly fresh and original 
savor is " The Humor of Spain " tickling the pal- 
ate, after the broader and homelier Irish product, 
with a tang as of wild fruit. Miss Taylor makes 
no claim to comprehensiveness for her collection, 
and its omissions will be patent to Spanish scholars. 



Enough is given, however, in prose and verse, from 
Cervantes down to the small witticisms of the news- 
paper scribe, to make an enjoyable and a fairly 
illustrative volume. The Spaniard jokes, as he 
lives, with much outward decorum ; and that he is 
not insensible of the national humors is evident in 
the following quip from " Blanco y Negro ": " A 
very ceremonious Spaniard, when asked why he 
was not present at the funeral of a certain person- 
age, replied, ' Because he owed me a call.' " The 
volumes are acceptably illustrated. 



A primer of 

American 

literature. 



Miss Mildred Cabell Watkins is the 
author of a primer of " American 
Literature" (American Book Co.) 
well adapted, in simplicity of style and selection of 
material, to the uses of children. The simplicity 
of the narrative is sometimes a little forced, but it 
does not degenerate into prattle, and the subject is 
attractively presented. We must enter a protest 
against such an expression as " poetry was not in 
their line," and against the use of that unspeakable 
word " brainy." The foot-note which describes 
Shakespeare as "one of the greatest of all writers" 
may be made the subject of a possible exception ; 
and that characterizing Locke as " a great mental 
philosopher of England who first studied and de- 
scribed the mind " is of course absurd. But the 
book, in the main, is well done, and deserves com- 
mendation. We note a few trifling inaccuracies, 
such as " Magnalia " for the title of Cotton Math- 
er's most famous work ; the statement that Park- 
man's history fills seven volumes ; and the other 
statement that a volume of Lowell's letters has 
been published. Nor is it quite accurate to say of 
Whitman that " his style is so very, very singular, 
that it has been named Whitmanesque." The plan 
of the book includes extracts, mostly very brief, and 
of the sort that children would do well in commit- 
ting to memory. Dates are mostly relegated to the 
summaries that end the chapters. Recent writers 
are well represented. A more modest view than is 
common in text-books characterizes the majority of 
the critical estimates, which is well. A slight ex- 
aggeration of the Southern element in our litera- 
ture may occasionally be detected. 

The Hfe and "The Life and Correspondence of 

correspondence of Rufus King" (Putnam), edited by 
RufutKing. Dr Charles R. King, his grandson, 

is a publication that will extend to five large octavo 
volumes, and form a worthy addition to the rapidly 
growing library of the Fathers of our Republic. 
The edition is handsomely printed and limited to 
750 copies. Two volumes of the series have now 
appeared, the first covering the thirty years of 
King's early life (1755-1794), the second carry- 
ing the record on to the penultimate year of the 
century. Nearly half a century ago the work now 
inaugurated was undertaken by President King of 
Columbia College, the father of the present editor, 
and the son of the Revolutionary orator, statesman,

and diplomatist. It was for some reason abandoned, 
but we may now expect it to be brought to a happy 
conclusion. Among the papers now published are 
King's notes taken during the Convention of 1787, 
of which he was one of the foremost members, and 
interesting as confirmatory of the accuracy of Mad- 
ison's report. " A continuous narrative of King's 
life," says the editor, "has not been attempted 
throughout the work, the correspondence filling up 
the gaps, tied together by explanatory remarks and 
notes. In an appendix to each volume there will 
be found many papers of interest, containing some 
of the writings and speeches of Mr. King during his 
long public career." 

The Arthur legend Readers who are disposed to inquire 
and Tennyson's curiously concerning the sources of 

treatment of it. & ^^ i nsp i rat j on or the me thods 

of his workmanship will find an interesting study 
in Dr. Richard Jones's examination into " The 
Growth of the Idylls of the King " ( Lippincott) . 
The Arthur legend having entered largely into the 
litei'ature of all European nations, Professor Jones 
begins his book with a survey of the development 
and dissemination of this legend previous to the time 
when Tennyson took hold of it. He devotes him- 
self especially to showing that Tennyson's obliga- 
tions to Malory have been overestimated, and that, 
in fact, Malory has no peculiar claims to stand as 
the sole representative of Arthurian legend ; his 
own book being a compilation, and not always a 
happy one, of tales which were the common prop- 
erty of the poets of all lands. Tennyson's subject- 
matter being thus largely the product of the imagi- 
nation of many peoples, widely separated in space 
and time, it becomes interesting to trace his use of 
his material, and to compare his treatment with that 
by other poets. The concluding chapter deals with 
the completed idylls, and shows that the plan of the 
poem grew as the poet wrought, and that, spite of 
their fragmentary mode of composition and publi- 
cation, the " Idylls of the King " is riot merely a 
succession of panel pictures, but one magnificent 
painting, an organic unity. 

A handbook T he Public Library of Denver has 

of library issued a ' ' Public Library Hand-book" 

which provides a compact body of 
detailed information concerning the workings and 
management of the institution. This pamphlet ought 
to be found extremely useful by the custodians of 
small collections, who are too often ignorant of the 
principles of library economy. In fact, a careful 
study of the book would provide a very fair substi- 
tute for professional training in librarianship, al- 
though we by no means recommend those who are 
in a position to get such training to neglect the op- 
portunity. The Dewey system of classification is 
made the basis of the sections on cataloguing, and 
the implication is now and then met with that a 
library should follow rather than direct popular 
taste. Such matters as these merely suggest that the 



book should be used with independent judgment. As 
a compendium of hints and directions bearing upon 
the minutest details of library work, the book is of 
a value much more than proportionate to its mod- 
est dimensions. 

Studies of nature Three uncommonly pretty books bear 
and humble life a somewhat similar type in being 
in England. studies of nature and humble life in 

small nooks of England, and in claiming attention 
rather by graces of style than by any absorbing in- 
terest of subject-matter. They are : Mr. J. S. 
Fletcher's " The Wonderful Wapentake " ( Mc- 
Clurg), Mr. John Watson's "Annals of a Quiet 
Valley in the Wordsworth Country" (Macmillan), 
and Mr. George Milner's " Studies of Nature on 
the Coast of Arran " (Longmans). For daintiness 
and attractive book-making," it would be hard to 
choose between the three, but the precedence for 
variety and sprightliness would have to be given to 
the first named ; for actual information concerning 
the early English laws, customs, and people, to the 
second ; and for poetic and literary touch in deal- 
ing with every-day and commonplace themes, to the 
third. Full-page illustrations, many of them fine 
copper-plates of much artistic value, are features of 
the three volumes. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A group of French texts for school use includes M. 
Verne's " Le Tour du Monde en Quatre-Vingts Jours," 
abridged and edited by Professor A. H. Edgren; M. 
Zola's " La Ddbacle," abridged and edited by Dr. Ben- 
jamin W. Wells; and " Fleurs de France," fifteen 
conies by such men as MM. Hale"vy, Droz, Coppde, and 
E. Daudet, edited by M. C. Fontaine. These three are 
from Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
send a selection, edited by Professor L. Oscar Kuhns, 
from the poems and comedies of Alfred de Musset, in- 
cluding three plays, and such poems as the four 
" Nuits." Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. publish Mr. 
E. E. M. Creak's edition of " La Poudre de Soissons," 
by Dumas pere, a very small book indeed. 

The " Atlas of Classical Antiquities " (Macmillan), 
prepared by Dr. T. Schreiber, and edited for English 
use by Professor W. C. F. Anderson, offers to English 
students at a moderate price one of the best reference 
works produced by recent German scholarship. The 
work is in form an oblong quarto, with one hundred 
full-page plates, each of which has one or more pages 
of descriptive text. The subjects are classified, those 
of the Drama, Religion, Athletics, Armor, and Arts and 
Crafts being especially noteworthy for fullness of illus- 
trative treatment. The work is very attractive in all 
respects. 

The work of the crammer is not so much in demand 
in America as in England, but the publishers of " The 
University Tutorial Series " have concluded to estab- 
lish a New York agency for the sale of their series of 
compact handbooks (W. B. Clive). We have received 
the following numbers: " An Elementary Text-Book of 
Heat," by Mr. R. W. Stewart; "An Elementary Text- 
Book of Hydrostatics," by Messrs. William Briggs and

G. H. Bryan; an edition of " De Amicitia," prepared by 
Messrs. A. H. Allcroft and W. F. Mason; and one of 
the " Phsedo," edited by Messrs. C. S. Fearenside and 
R. C. B. Kerin. 

In addition to the recently-noticed modern language 
publications of Mr. W. R. Jenkins, we have since re- 
ceived a number of others from the same house. 
" Lectures Faciles pour 1'Etude du Francais," by M. 
Paul Bercy, is a volume of simple prose texts, with 
annotations. " Simples Notions de Frangais," by the 
same author, is a picture-book for very youthful begin- 
ners. " Mme. Beck's French Verb Form" is not ex- 
actly a book, but rather a sheaf of blanks to be filled 
out by students with selected conjugations. It is a use- 
ful piece of apparatus for the teacher. " Partir & 
Tiempo," by Don Mariano Jose* de Larro, is a one-act 
comedy, edited by Mr. A. W. Herdler, and forming a 
number of the " Teatro Espanol " series. 

The Northwestern University of Evanston has issued 
a handsome pamphlet report of the exercises at the open- 
ing of the Orrington Lunt Library Building, September 
26, 1894. Two full-page plates give us a photograpli 
of the building and a portrait of the donor. The " ex- 
ercises " include the address of presentation and accept- 
ance, a dedication ode by Mrs. Emily Huntington Mil- 
ler, some remarks by President Adams of the University 
of Wisconsin, and a lengthy address on "The Develop- 
ment of the Library," by Dr. Justin Winsor, who was 
the special guest of the occasion. 

The Modern Language Association of America is 
the publisher of two doctor's dissertations recently sent 
us. Mr. Edwin Seelye Lewis, of Princeton, has for his 
subject " Guernsey: Its People and Dialect." Mr. Lewis 
made two visits to Guernsey, and mingled with all 
classes of its population. A similar study is that of 
" The Phonology of the Pistojese Dialect," by Mr. 
James Dowden Bruner, recently of the University of 
Illinois, and now of the University of Chicago. The 
writer's material was collected during a six months' 
stay in Pistoja and the surrounding villages. Both of 
these dissertations are pieces of solid and conscientious 
workmanship, and well illustrate the zeal of our younger 
men in the pursuit of their chosen sciences. 

Messrs. Eldredge & Bro. publish a neat leather- 
bound pocket edition of the Constitution of the United 
States. It will go into the smallest of vest-pockets, and 
contains, besides the text, a bibliography, an analytical 
index, the dates of ratification of the instrument, and 
the dates and manner of ratification of the several 
amendments. The text has been carefully compared 
with the original in the Department of State, and what 
little editing the booklet needed has been done by Pro- 
fessor Francis N. Thorpe. 

Two new editions of the novels of Smollett, inaugur- 
ated almost simultaneously, call for a word of praise. 
One is an edition to Bohn's " Novelists' Library " (Mac- 
millan), and gives us "Peregrine Pickle " in two vol- 
umes, and " Roderick Random " in one. The familiar 
style of this " Library " makes further description unnec- 
essary. The other edition, of which " Roderick Ran- 
dom," in three volumes, is now issued, is edited by Mr. 
George Saintsbury, and is published, in close imitation 
of the Dent editions of English Classics, by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. in this country, and by Messrs. Gibbings 
& Co. in London. 

The beautifully-printed polychrome edition of the 
Old Testament texts, edited by Dr. Paul Haupt and 



published in this country by the Johns Hopkins Press, 
was described by us some time ago in connection with 
the "Job," which inaugurated the series. "Leviticus" 
and " Samuel " are the two parts now issued, the former 
edited by Professor Driver and the Rev. H. A. White, 
the latter by Professor Budde of Strassburg. Two col- 
ors suffice for the former text, while no less than eight 
are required for the latter. The price of these texts is 
very low, being made considerably less than cost by the 
generosity of a modest American Msecenas. 

Dr. A. H. Edgren has prepared a new translation of 
" Sakuntala," or, as he spells it, " Shakuntala," and the 
book is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The 
two previous translations into English are those of Sir 
William Jones and Sir M. Monier- Williams, respec- 
tively dating from 1789 and 1856. The present trans- 
slator has aimed at a more literal version than his pre- 
decessors. The metrical passages are in unrhymed 
iambic tetrameter. We are surely entitled to three En- 
glish translations of this great work, in view of the fact 
that the Germans have a dozen or more. 

" On the Eve," that masterpiece of absolutely flaw- 
less art, appears as the third volume in Mrs. Garnett's 
new translation of the novels of Tourgue"nieff, having 
been preceded by " Rudin " and " A House of Gentle- 
folk " (Macmillan). Mr. Edward Garnett writes the 
introduction, which is in the main an adequate appre- 
ciation, although the figure of Insaroff appears a failure 
to the critic (which it emphatically is not), and although 
too tendenzios a character is ascribed to the novel. 

A library edition of " The Surprising Adventures of 
Baron Munchausen," imported by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons, is an unexpected but not unwelcome acces- 
sion to our shelves. The edition is made particularly 
valuable by Mr. Thomas Seccombe's lengthy introduc- 
tion, which discusses the origin and fortunes of the work. 
Rudolph Erich Raspe is accepted as the author by Mr. 
Seccombe, and some account of his life is given. The 
original text of 1785 is here reproduced, together with 
the successive enlargements down to the seventh edi- 
tion, published in 1 793. Although Rowlandson, Cruik- 
shauk, and Dore* are numbered among the many illus- 
trators of this work, the present edition, instead of 
drawing upon the older artists, is supplied with a new 
set of drawings by Messrs. William Strang and J. B. 
Clark.

Albert Shaw. 

We understand that the new series of translations of 
Tourgudnieff's novels will be supplemented by a uniform 
collection of the short stories. We trust that the re- 
port is true and that the collection will be an absolutely 
complete one. 

" Should the elementary study of grammar be chiefly 
inductive? " is the question put and affirmatively an- 
swered by Professor Starr W. Cutting in a reprint of 
the proceedings of the last meeting of the Modern Lan- 
guage Association. 

Italy may be having a hard time of it politically, and 
may be upon the verge of national bankruptcy, but lit- 
erary production goes on uninterrupted. No less than 
9416 volumes are reported for the past year, nearly 
two thousand of them coming from Lombardy. 

The Burrows Brothers Co., of Cleveland, will in the 
fall begin publication of their great projected edition of 
the " Relations des Je"suites," with a complete text and 
page-for-page translations. There will be about sixty 
volumes, appearing' monthly, and the edition will be 
limited to 750 copies. 

Mr. Gladstone has written a letter to the Rev. F. D. 
Greene, author of " The Armenian Crisis in Turkey," 
expressing the belief that the work " will materially as- 
sist in rousing public attention to the recent outrages 
in Armenia, which almost pass description, and have in- 
flicted indelible disgrace on the Sultan of Turkey and 
on his officers and soldiers concerned in perpetrating, 
in denying, and in shielding them." 

" The Proofsheet " is the name of a modest periodi- 
cal, published monthly at 232 Irving avenue, Chicago, 
whose conductors are making it of practical value to 
writers and correctors for the press. An example of its 
usefulness is the publication, in its May issue, of a list 
of words variously spelled by the four dictionaries 
chiefly used in this country the International (Web- 
ster's), Worcester's, the Century, and the Standard. 
The words are over six hundred in number, and are ar- 
ranged in parallel columns so as to show the variations 
at a glance. 

Chancellor James Hulme Canfield, of the University 
of Nebraska, has accepted a call to the presidency of 
the Ohio State University at Columbus, and will assume 
his new duties with the coming academic year. This 
step is full of significance and promise for the fortunes 
of the Ohio institution. Dr. Canfield 's reputation has 
been won in various fields of activity, each of which 
seems to have added its element of strength to the char- 
acter of the man. Born in Ohio, reared and educated 
in New England, attorney and school-superintendent in 
Michigan, professor in Kansas, and college president in 
Nebraska, he has now, in the fullness of his powers and 
the ripeness of his experience, returned to his native 
State, to take his place at the head of her system of 
public instruction, and to perform, it is hoped, for Ohio, 
that service which he has so loyally and successfully ren- 
dered to Nebraska. It may as well be admitted that the 
task before him has its perplexities. Ohio is now an old 
State, with many persistent strains of immigration, many 
sharp lines of cleavage in politics and morals, many re- 
ligious denominations, and a rather unfortunate we 
will not say a bad eminence in higher education, hav- 
ing more than three dozen colleges within her borders. 
But " Res servera est verum gaudium " and the com- 



plexity of the problem must constitute, to such natures 
as Dr. Canfield's, its attraction and its inspiration. 

Dr. James Martineau celebrated his ninetieth birth- 
day on the 23rd of April, and was duly congratulated 
by a deputation from Manchester College, Oxford. The 
address said, among other things: " We recognise the 
dignity and honour conferred on the college by your 
connexion with it as professor, principal, and president, 
associating its name with your high service to religious 
philosophy. And to the spirit infused into the life of 
the college by your steadfastness always to the free 
teaching and the free learning of theology, it largely 
owes its constant fidelity to this fundamental principle." 
Dr. Martineau made an interesting reply, in which he 
briefly reviewed his life, touching upon the influences 
by which it had been shaped, and indicating the future 
development, in his opinion, of religious philosophy. 
Particularly interesting was his statement of the two 
influences which claimed special consideration in his 
retrospect. " One was the literature which had come 
to this country from the United States, chiefly from the 
pen of Dr. Chauning. He remembered when Dr. Chan- 
ning's teachings were regarded by some of the older 
men with disfavor amounting even to bitterness; but 
he himself, in common with many of the younger men 
in his day, had been greatly touched by the deep spir- 
itual humility and search after personal holiness which 
characterized that great man's preaching. Another in- 
fluence was that of the Evangelical literature associated 
with the name of Wilberforce, of which he became 
aware only by accident."

MEMOIRS OF BARRAS. 

Member of the Directorate. Edited, with a General Introduction, Prefaces, and Appendices, by GEORGE DURTJY. With 
Seven Portraits in Photogravure, Two Facsimiles, and Two Plans. In Four Volumes. Vol. I. The Ancient Regime and 
the Revolution. Vol. II. The Directorate up to the 18th Fructidor. 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops. Vols. I. 
and II. now ready, $3.75 a volume. 

The " Memoirs of Barras " appear simultaneously in the United States, France, England, and Germany. Beyond all question they will be 
eagerly read by lovers of Napoleonic and Revolutionary lore, by the historian and the searcher after new and entertaining anecdote. The import- 
ance and historical value of these memoirs may be judged from the fact that for over half a century historians and publicists have been clamoring 
for their publication. 

Barras was plainly a person of consequence in the turbulent Paris of the Revolution and the Directorate. He touched shoulders with all the 
leaders. He was the patron almost the discoverer of the obscure Lieutenant Bonaparte, as he was the implacable foe of the Emperor Napoleon. 
He lived to be the counsellor of kings. He was as much at home in the salon of a great lady as in the National Assembly, and he knew the gossip 
of society as well as he knew the decrees of the Deputies. He was a good hater. The lash of his tongue was sharp, and he spared neither man 
nor woman. Pages of the "Memoirs" record his dislikes and his retaliations. If he heard a discreditable report about an acquaintance, he 
imparted it to his confidential blank-books. Barras was a sharp observer looking on at history in the making, and his time becomes the more 
intelligible to us for his interpretation of it. 

THE LIFE OF SAMUEL J. TILDEN. >U '' L 

By JOHN BIGELOW, Author of "Life of Benjamin Franklin," "France and the Confederate Navy," Editor of "Writings and 

Speeches of Samuel J. Tilden," etc. With Portraits and Illustrations. Two Volumes. Nvo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and 

Gilt Tops, $6.00. (In a box.) 

" A man more qualified than the author for the production of this book it would be difficult to find, for Mr. Bigelow is not only a man of 
letters, a diplomatist, and a journalist who, for upwards of a generation, has discussed public affairs of the largest significance, but he was bound 
to the subject of his book by intimate personal acquaintance and by a community of political traditions and sympathies. The result is that we 
have here a complete and vivid portrait of a memorable figure in the public life of the Empire commonwealth and of the nation, and also materials 
of great value for the political history of the country during the momentous period that intervened between 1830 and 1880." New York Sun. 

" Politics aside, the figure of Tilden will always be one of the most interesting in American history ; all the more interesting as time brings 
to view the phenomenal contrasts in his life and character. Mr. Bigelow's book furnishes material in ample quantity for the study of many of 
these contrasts." New York Tribune. 

" Mr. Bigelow's long and close intimacy with Tilden, and his own large experience in politics and in authorship, made him naturally the lit- 
erary executor of his friend, as he was a trustee of his estate. The resulting biography, now before us, has an assured historical value, corre- 
sponding to the importance of Mr. Tilden's career." Nation (New York). 

" Exceedingly readable', and, as a biography, it leaves little to be desired." The Dial (Chicago). 

"The most important American biography that has been published in many years." Philadelphia Inquirer. 

" This well wrought account of one of the great leaders of the Democratic party comes from the practised hand of the biographer of Franklin 
and Bryant." -Literary World (Boston). 

THE AMERICAN CONGRESS. ? 

A History of National Legislation and Political Events, 1774-1894. By JOSEPH WEST MOOKE. 8vo, Cloth, $3.00. 

" What is hardly to be found elsewhere in any single volume, a consecutive history of Congress, noting in detail its most essential acts, with 
some account of famous debates, the vote on critical measures, and a glimpse of leading men. This useful work is done with evident industry and 
good faith, and with general fairness." Philadelphia Times. 

" It would be difficult to praise too highly the educational value and interest of the history of national legislation and political events which 
Joseph West Moore puts forth under the title of ' The American Congress.' " Boston Beacon. 

" Throughout his work he aims to tell what has happened not what should have happened ; he does not assign motives, but allows the per- 
sons concerned to stand before his readers, as they stood before the country when they made their speeches and cast their votes." N. Y. Times. 

" Most exhaustive in treatment, and many interesting minor events and personal peculiarities of statesmen are recorded." New York Press.

either the cases decided by the courts relative to this matter, or the various constitutional provisions assuring to municipalities 
the right to manage their own affairs ; from the political point of view, because any theory which the courts may have form- 
ulated upon the subject has presumptions in its favor resulting from the fact that their conclusions have been reached through 
the following of inductive rather than deductive methods.

HANDBOOK OF BIRDS 

OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. With Keys to the Species ; 
Descriptions of their Plumages, Nests, etc.; their Distribu- 
tion and Migrations. By FRANK M. CHAPMAN, Assistant 
Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology, American Museum 
of Natural History. With nearly 200 Illustrations. 12mo. 
Library Edition, cloth, $3.00; Pocket Edition, flexible 
morocco, $3.50. 

This book treats of all the birds, some five hundred and forty 
in number, which have been found east of the Mississippi 
River and from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. 
The author's position has not only given him exceptional 
opportunities for the preparation of a work which may be con- 
sidered as authoritative, but has brought him in direct con- 
tact with beginners in the study of birds whose wants he thus 
thoroughly understands. The technicalities so confusing to 
the amateur are avoided, and by the use of illustrations, con- 
cise descriptions, analytical keys, dates of migration, and re- 
marks on distribution, haunts, notes, and characteristic 
habits, the problem of identification, either in the field or 
study, is reduced to its simplest terms. 

FAMILIAR FLOWERS OF FIELD 
AND GARDEN. 

By F. SCHUYLER MATHEWS. Illustrated with 200 Drawings 
by the Author. 12mo. Library Edition, cloth, $1.75 ; 
Pocket Edition, flexible morocco, $2.25. 
In this convenient and useful volume the flowers which one 
finds in the fields are identified, illustrated, and described in 
familiar language. Their connection with garden flowers is 
made clear. Particular attention is drawn to the beautiful 
ones which have come under cultivation, and, as the title in- 
dicates, the book furnishes a ready guide to a knowledge of 
wild and cultivated flowers alike. An elaborate 50-page index 
shows at a glance botanical aud popular names, family, color, 
locality, environment, and time of bloom of several hundred 
flowers. 

AN AIDE = DE- CAMP OF NAPOLEON. 

Memoirs of General Count DE SEGUR, of the French Acad- 
emy, 1800-1812. Revised by his grandson, Count Louis 
DE SEGUR. Uniform with Meneval's memoirs. With 
frontispiece. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

This volume forms a natural companion or pendant to the 
" Memoirs of the Baron de Me"neval." The Count de Se"gur's 
military career began in 1800. He was made a general in 1812, 
and took part in all the wars of the Empire as a member of 
Napoleon's staff or the commander of a select corps. Hohen- 
linden, missions to Denmark and Spain, the execution of the 
Due d'Enghien, the preparations for the invasion of England, 
Austerlitz, Ulm, Jena, Berlin, Spain, and the intrigues of 
Fouch4 and Bernadotte, are among the subjects of his chap- 
ters treated with the advantages of personal knowledge, and, 
in the earlier pages, of intimate information due to his father's 
associations and position. The historical value of the mem- 
oirs is obvious, and their interest is enhanced by the author's 
graphic and lucid style. 

FRIEDRICH FROEBEL'S PEDAGOGICS OF 
THE KINDERGARTEN ; 

OR, His" IDEAS CONCERNING THE PLAY AND PLAYTHINGS OF 
THE CHILD. Translated by JOSEPHINE JARVIS. Interna- 
tional Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
This book holds the keynote of the " New Education," and 
will assist many in a correct comprehension of the true prin- 
ciples underlying the practical outcome of Froebel's thought. 
Although extant for nearly fifty years, his ideas are still in 
need of elucidation, and the average kindergartner and pri- 
mary-school teacher grasps but a superficial meaning of the 
methods suggested. 



ACTUAL AFRICA; 

OR, THE COMING CONTINENT. A Tour of Exploration. By 
FRANK VINCENT, author of " Around and About South 
America," "In and Out of Central America," etc. With 
Map and 104 full-page Illustrations. 8vo, cloth, $5.00. 
This thorough and comprehensive work furnishes a survey 
of the entire continent which this experienced traveler has 
circumnavigated in addition to his inland explorations. The 
latter have included journeys in northern Africa, Madagascar, 
southern Africa, and an expedition into the Congo country 
which has covered fresh ground. His book has the distinc- 
tion of presenting a comprehensive summary instead of offer- 
ing an account of one special district. It is more elaborately 
illustrated than any book upon the subject, and contains a 
large map carefully corrected to date. 

THE ART OF NEWSPAPER MAKING. 

Three Lectures. By CHARLES A. DANA. IGmo, cloth, $1.00. 
The art of making a newspaper that is read is one of which 
Mr. Dana has proved himself a past master. Those who fol- 
low his calling will turn to his book to discover the secret. 
Those who read newspapers and this is a nation of newspa- 
per readers will feel a lively interest in the views and expe- 
riences of the dean of American newspaper-makers. 

A DICTIONARY OF TERMS, PHRASES, 
AND QUOTATIONS. 

The Terms and Phrases edited by the Rev. H. PERCY SMITH, 
M.A., of Baliol College, Oxford. The Quotations compiled 
for the American edition by HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON. 
New Edition. 8vo, half cloth, $3.00. 

This work brings together such words, expressions, quota- 
tions, etc., English or other, as are among the more uncom- 
mon in current literature and require explanations for the gen- 
eral reader. Some of the terms are more or less technical, 
some are simply uncommon, some contain historical, geo- 
graphical, or mythological allusions, and some belong to other 
languages. The book supplies the information needed by 
general readers who wish to follow the text of any work in 
ordinary English literature.

THE SUMMER SCHOOL. 

Observers of our educational activity can- 
not fail to have been impressed by the recent 
growth of the Summer School. The phase of 
educational work represented by that deserving 
institution attracts yearly more and more atten- 
tion, and every recurrent summer season offers 
to the ambitious student a wider choice among 
places and subjects. In the earlier chapters of 
its history the outcome of private initiative, 
the organized forces of American education 
soon perceived the possibilities of the Summer 
School as a supplementary educational process, 
and now associate themselves unequivocally 
with its work. The imposing list of gather- 
ings more or less educational in character, 
planned for the present year, as presented in 
the May " Review of Reviews," gives some idea 
of the dimensions to which the work has grown, 



and even this list is admittedly incomplete. 
" More than one hundred Summer Schools," 
we are told, " will be in active operation in the 
United States during the coming season." 
Perhaps the best indication of the extent to 
which Summer Schools have become an ac- 
cepted factor in our educational work is afforded 
by the Report of the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1891-92, just issued 
from the Government Printing Office. For this 
Report, a special investigation of the subject 
of Summer Schools was made by Dr. W. W. 
Willoughby, and the results of that investiga- 
tion may well be considered surprising even by 
those fairly familiar with the subject. 

Every new educational movement finds dis- 
senters, and there is involved in this growing 
utilization of the summer months for educa- 
tional purposes a fundamental principle that 
cannot be altogether ignored. There are some 
who will see in the movement merely another 
indication of that hurry and unrest so charac- 
teristic of American life in its other phases, 
and who will claim that our summer vacations 
ought to be devoted to their primary purpose 
of relaxation and recreation. And there is no 
doubt that we need really to rest at times, to 
break the process of over-stimulation, to give 
our weary nerves an opportunity to renew their 
dissipated energies. The best work is not, as 
a rule, done by those who toil for the greatest 
number of hours or days, but rather by those 
who so shape their lives as to maintain the 
working period at its highest potency. Yet it 
must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that 
the truest rest is not that of torpor or lethargy, 
but is rather to be sought in variety of interest 
or aim. And the Summer School, carried on 
as it usually is among the mountains or by 
lakeside and seashore, means for the most of 
us so complete a change of environment that it 
may bring recuperation to the tired brain even 
although that brain persist in the moderate 
exercise of its habitual function. At all events, 
the objections of the dissenter are minimized, 
and need not be taken very seriously. Some 
sympathy may indeed be demanded for the 
officers and instructors of the Summer School, 
since to them, more nearly than to the average 
student, the work done is a continuation of the 
kind of work they have been doing all the rest

of the year, and the sacrifices they are called 
upon to make are not inconsiderable. There is 
something wrong about a system which pre- 
tends that nine or ten months of work are 
enough for the teacher, yet which compensates 
him so inadequately for that work as to force 
him to eke out his income by working on for 
the two or three months remaining. As long 
as any large proportion of the instruction in our 
Summer Schools is done by men thus compelled 
to do it, not only will the efficiency of the Sum- 
mer School suffer, but the tone of the whole 
educational profession will remain lower than 
it ought to be. 

Historically, the American Summer School 
begins with the establishment, in 1872, of 
the Zoological Laboratory on Penikese Island, 
under the direction of Louis Agassiz. That fa- 
mous school, which had but two sessions, was 
the progenitor of the Chesapeake School of the 
Johns Hopkins University, the schools at An- 
nisquam and Wood's Holl, and the school of 
the Brooklyn Institute on Long Island. These 
biological schools form a group by themselves, 
and no one can question the great importance 
of the work they have done in original research 
and the training of specialists. Allied to them 
are the schools forming the second group in 
Dr. Willoughby's classification, described as 
" Summer Schools giving instruction in single 
subjects." Towards this group the Concord 
School of Philosophy, opened in 1879, occupies 
the historical relation of the Penikese Labora- 
tory to the schools of the biological group. The 
Concord School had ten annual sessions, the 
last of them, in 1888, being limited to an Al- 
cott memorial service. Of its several succes- 
sors, the most direct, if we take both spirit and 
organization into account, is the school con- 
ducted by Mr. Thomas Davidson, for a few 
years at Farmington, Connecticut, afterwards 
and still at a secluded spot in Keene Valley, New 
York, beautifully situated in the heart of the 
Adirondacks. It is now called the Glenmore 
School, and is devoted to the culture sciences. 
The Plymouth School of Applied Ethics, in- 
augurated in 1891, mainly through the efforts 
of Dr. Felix Adler, may also be considered here. 
It represents the highest scientific plane yet 
reached by the schools of this group, and its 
field and influence have broadened with every 
succeeding year of its existence. We have not 
space even to name the remaining schools de- 
voted to special subjects, conspicuous among 
which are the many flourishing schools of music 
and the languages dotting the country from 



East to West. And we must also pass by with- 
out mention the countless summer institutes 
and other schools for the training of teachers 
that are every year pursuing their silent but 
effective work of raising the standard of the 
teaching profession in our country. 

The Chautauqua system, with its ever broad- 
ening scope, and its countless ramifications, 
must have a paragraph to itself. It is estimated 
that more than one person in every hundred of 
our entire population visits the yearly gather- 
ings of the various schools organized upon the 
Chautauqua plan, if not directly controlled by 
its management. The beginnings of this sys- 
tem are to be looked for only a score of years 
back. In 1874 occurred the first summer meet- 
ing on the shores of Lake Chautauqua, planned 
by Mr. Lewis Miller and Dr. John H. Vincent. 
From this first meeting, attended by some six 
hundred students from all parts of the coun- 
try, there has sprung the system of popular 
education whose name is now a household word 
throughout the land. The Chautauqua Assem- 
bly proper provides a great variety of courses 
in history, literature, language, science, and 
pedagogics. The College of Liberal Arts, 
superadded in 1879, offers courses of a more 
exacting character, having much of the char- 
acter of regular college work, and, like such 
work, leading to degrees that are not so lightly 
bestowed as some people imagine. Then there 
are the outlying Chautauqua assemblies, a num- 
erous progeny, held in attractive spots scat- 
tered all over the country. More than sixty of 
these assemblies attest the fertility of the fun- 
damental Chautauqua idea of combining in- 
struction with recreation. It is easy to scoff 
at the work of these assemblies, and to point 
out the obvious fact that they are in no sense 
substitutes for the colleges proper ; it is easy 
to visit any one of them, and have an eye for 
its vacation aspect alone ; it is easy, also, to 
talk about scrappiness and superficiality ; but 
all comment of this sort is beside the mark. 
No one can take a close view of the Chautau- 
qua work without recognizing in it a very 
shrewd and practical application of possible 
means to a highly desirable end ; no one can 
take a broad view of the work without seeing 
that it is a factor of appreciable importance in 
our educational life. 

In conclusion, we must say a few words 
about the steadily increasing amount of sum- 
mer work undertaken by the universities them- 
selves, with the aid of their organization, 
equipment, and scientific methods. In a cer-

tain sense, the Penikese Laboratory of Agassiz 
should open this chapter of our history, for it 
was the evident utility of such an enterprise 
that led to the organization of the Harvard 
summer courses, which have, since 1874, formed 
a regular department of the work of that Uni- 
versity. Scientific subjects have mainly occu- 
pied these courses, and the work has been 
chiefly planned to meet the needs of teach- 
ers. These Harvard courses emphasize the im- 
portant principle that pedagogic instruction 
should not be purely theoretical, but should 
rather take up, although still with pedagogic 
intent, some concrete branch of knowledge, 
and, in teaching its substance, at the same 
time convey an acquaintance with the methods 
that its teachers should employ. The Univer- 
sity of Virginia was also a pioneer in the work 
of Summer Schools, and its School of Law was 
started as early as 1870, although it remained in 
an embryonic state until 1875. One institution 
after another has since fallen into line, and 
summer work is now done at Cornell, Yale, 
Columbia, Stanford, and many of the State 
Universities of the West. The University Ex- 
tension movement is also taking possession of 
the summer field, and such a programme as 
that offered for the coming season at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania is really extraordinary 
in its scope and interest. It remained, how- 
ever, for the new University of Chicago first 
to occupy the position that the summer months 
are just as good as any others for full univer- 
sity work in all departments, and first to offer 
the example of a great institution of learning 
open to students from one end of the year to 
the other. The results of a first season, and 
the now completed arrangements for a second, 
all go to show that President Harper had reason 
to attach great importance to this unprece- 
dented feature of the University planned by 
him. At a single bound this new educational 
departure has passed from the experimental 
stage to the stage of successfully accomplished 
fact, and summer education has entered upon 
the most serious phase that it has yet known in 
this country. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

THE ANTIQUITY OF GREEK LYRIC POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The most competent of American students upon the 
literary side of classics, reviewing in your columns 
Jebb's " Classical Greek Poetry," assures us most em- 
phatically that we may rely upon the absolute accuracy 
of the outlines and proportions in this general sketch 



of Hellenic literature. I heartily agree with this judg- 
ment (lamenting only that Mr. Jebb's limits, and Greek 
sense of proportion, compelled him to omit altogether 
such fascinating chapters as the Epic Cycle, the Hom- 
eric Hymns, etc.), and quote it only as an excuse for 
craving space in your pages to try and point out a single 
seriously doubtful statement, in a volume which puts 
every Philhellene under renewed obligations. 

Professor Jebb declares (page 35), " The true epic 
poetry had finished its course before the earliest lyric 
strains were heard." That our earliest authentic remains 
of literary lyric are those of Callinos and Tyrtseus in 
the seventh century B. c., and that the real epic had 
then already run its course, is unquestioned. But Pro- 
fessor Jebb's statement, often repeated elsewhere in 
his volume, is far more sweeping. 

It seems on general grounds quite certain that such 
a people must have had the " service of song " in the 
more purely personal and social relations of life, cen- 
turies before Callinos, or even before the stately epic 
arose. The hexameter itself probably represents the 
doubling of a lighter metrical unit, more suited for 
personal utterance, perhaps the progenitor of Anacreon's 
verse with three accents. Even such a mythic figure as 
Orpheus seems like a survival, not the pure invention 
of a later age. 

But we may fairly appeal to the evidence of the Hom- 
eric poems themselves, to which Mr. Jebb also has 
recourse for his conception of the epic minstrel. Even 
if we accept the author's own rigid definition of epic as 
" poetry which was recited, not sung to music" (page 32), 
we need turn but three leaves to find his own transla- 
tion of the beautiful Homeric passage, describing the 
" minstrel whom the gods have taught to sing words of 
yearning joy to mortals." 

But in the larger and more important sense, lyric 
poetry is surely traceable, in many of its most charac- 
teristic forms, to the heroic age. Of course the pass- 
ages we cite are perfectly familiar to every Homeric 
student, indeed, they may have come into our own 
notebook from Professor Jebb's still more scholarly 
earlier manual on Homer, but they do perhaps prove 
the point, that even he has for once yielded to the pecul- 
iar temptation of the popular lecturer, and made too 
sweeping a general statement. 

So early as Iliad I., 473, we hear the 

" Youthful Ach ;eans singing the beautiful paean, 

Chanting the Archer's praise ": 

And again as a token of triumph the same song is in- 
tuned, at the great crisis of the plot, when Achilles ex- 
ults over the dead Hector (Iliad xxii., 391-2) : 

" Come now let us sing our paean, sons of Achaeans, 
While to the ships we march." 

The Dirge must be equally prehistoric, and is plainly 
alluded to in the lament for Patroclus at Iliad xix., 
301-2, and still more clearly in the mourning for Hec- 
tor at Iliad xxiv., 720-722. Achilles himself holds the 
lyre in hand, and sings the "glories of heroes." Here, 
however, Homer may be quietly claiming the high-born 
hero as one of his own epic school ! But it can hardly 
be necessary to multiply citations. That immediate im- 
pulsive expression which we call lyric must surely be 
almost everywhere the oldest form of rhythmical and 
musical utterance. The freaks that Time's gusts have 
played with the loose Sibylline leaves of recorded tradi- 
tion is a very different matter.

THE NEW COLERIDGE LETTERS.* 



The revival of general interest in the life 
and works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is partly 
traceable to the excellent Life of him written 
by Mr. James Dykes Campbell as an introduc- 
tion to the single-volume edition of his poems. 
Mr. Campbell's biography, though very concise, 
contains much new matter, and this was mainly 
drawn from a mass of then unpublished letters 
in the custody of Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge, 
a son of Derwent Coleridge, the poet's second 
son. A selection of these letters, together with 
other important ones already printed, is now 
issued by Mr. Coleridge in two large and elab- 
orate volumes under the title of " Letters of 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge." While the work 
will not place its author beside his friends Lamb 
and Southey as a letter-writer, or even rank 
him a good second to those masters of episto- 
lary style, it forms, when read in the light of 
Mr. Campbell's lucid sketch, a biographical 
record as full and searching as the most curi- 
ous Coleridgean can reasonably ask. That the 
record is essentially a painful one we need 
scarcely say the story, mainly, of a life of un- 
bounded promise and fragmentary performance; 
of splendid powers thwarted by sordid failings 
and congenital defects. The tale of Coleridge's 
shortcomings is familiar enough in its general 
features. His friends and his critics have freely 
deplored his infirmity of will ; his indolence, 
unthrift, unreliableness ; his slavery to opium ; 
his desertion of his family (for it was nothing 
less) ; his small pecuniary shifts ; his aimless 
drifting from shelter to shelter, content to pay 
for his lodging with his mellifluous talk, and 
taking no thought for the morrow, his creditors, 
his publishers, or his promises, so long as he 
had the means to satisfy his present craving for 
" the Kendal Black Drop." " I give it to you 
as my deliberate opinion," wrote Wordsworth 
in 1809, " that he neither will nor can execute 
anything of important benefit to himself, his 
family, or mankind ; all is frustrated by a de- 
rangement in his intellectual and moral consti- 
tution. In fact, he has no voluntary power of 
mind whatever, nor is he capable of acting 
under any constraint of duty or moral obliga- 
tion." " He is capable," said the sure-witted 
Hazlitt, " of doing anything that does not pre-

sent itself as a duty," and nowhere has the 
vital defect in Coleridge's nature been more 
shrewdly and concisely put. Our knowledge 
of his childhood is drawn entirely from his let- 
ters to Poole in 1797. They are sad enough 
in substance, though not lacking in a certain 
plaintive humor. He describes himself as a 
precocious and imaginative child, passionate, 
timorous, hating rough sports, and immoder- 
ately fond of reading, a character at eight, 
" flattered and wondered at " by the women, 
and " despised and hated by the boys," who 
bullied him after the manner of their kind, and 
drove him, as a young pariah, from the play- 
ground to seek refuge with his books and his 
book-bred fancies. 

" So I used," he says, " to lie by the wall and mope; 
and my spirits used to come upon me sudden and in a 
flood ; and I would then run up and down the church- 
yard, and act over again all I had been reading, to the 
docks and nettles and the rank grass. At six years of 
age I remember to have read ' Belisarius,' Robinson 
Crusoe,' and 'Philip Quarll'; and then I found the 
' Arabian Nights,' one tale of which made so deep an 
impression on me . . . that I was haunted by spectres 
when I was in the dark; and I distinctly recollect the 
anxious and fretful eagerness with which I used to watch 
the window where the book lay, and when the sun came 
upon it, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask 
and read. . . . Alas! I had all the simplicity, all the 
docility of a little child, but none of the child's habits. 
I never thought as a child, never had the language of a 
child." 

Coleridge's use of opiates began in boy- 
hood. Laudanum was administered to him at 
school during an attack of rheumatic fever 
brought on by exposure ; and we find in a letter 
to Poole that he was using it freely as an ano- 
dyne in 1796. After describing the neuralgic 
pains from which he suffered, he continues : 

" It (the pain) lasted from one in the morning till 
half-past five, and left me pale and fainting. It came 
on fitfully, but not so violently, several times on Thurs- 
day, and began severer threats towards night ; but I 
took between sixty and seventy drops of laudanum, and 
sopped the Cerberus, just as his mouth began to open." 

There is little doubt that the baneful disease 
ran its usual course with Coleridge. He was, 
as he claimed, " seduced into the use of nar- 
cotics," using the " accursed drug " first as an 
anodyne ; then as a relief from fits of mental de- 
pression ; and then as a mere indulgence and 
for the sake of the pleasurable sensations it 
arouse^. Happily, there was with him a fourth 
stage, the stage of comparative abstinence 
which marked his closing years spent under the 
friendly roof of the Gillmans the last of 
those " perpetual relays which," as De Quincey 
said, " were laid along his path in life." 



1895.]

Coleridge's friends placed little credit in his 
sufficiently lame assertion that he resorted to 
laudanum (his allowance at one period being 
from two quarts a week to a pint a day I) 
chiefly to relieve bodily pain. The plain- 
spoken Southey, for instance, " knew, * as did 
all with whom Coleridge lived,' that after every 
allowance is made for ' morbid bodily causes,' 
the habit is, ' for infinitely the greater part,' 
motived ' by inclination and indulgence.' ' 

Coleridge's letters on this painful topic are 
usually a medley of half-way confessions, lam- 
entations, and pleas self -justificatory. There 
is one, however, to Mr. Wade (1814), which 
shows that at bottom he was under no delusions 
as to the true nature of the habit which, it is 
no exaggeration to say, blighted his life and 
cheated his genius of half its fame. The letter 
is the saddest, perhaps the frankest, he ever 
penned. 

" DEAR SIR, for I am unworthy to call any man friend 

much less you, whose hospitality and love I have 
abused; accept, however, my entreaties for your for- 
giveness, and for your prayers. Conceive a poor miser- 
able wretch, who for many years has been attempting 
to beat off pain, by a constant recurrence to the vice 
that reproduces it. Conceive a spirit in hell employed 
in tracing out for others the road to that heaven from 
which his crimes exclude him. In short, conceive what- 
ever is most wretched, helpless, and hopeless. ... In 
the one crime of opium, what crime have I not made 
myself guilty of! ingratitude to my Maker! and to my 
benefactors injustice! and unnatural cruelty to my 
poor children! self-contempt for my repeated promise 

breach, nay, too often, actual falsehood! After my 
death I earnestly entreat that a full and unqualified 
narration of my wretchedness and of its guilty cause 
may be made public, that at least some little good may 
be affected by the direful example." 

The letters written during the Cambridge 
period throw some light on the familiar dra- 
gooning episode. Of the immediate causes of 
Coleridge's flight from the University and sub- 
sequent enlistment, nothing very definite is 
known. Mr. Gillman and the delinquent him- 
self attribute it to debts ; and Cottle ascribes 
it to the love affair with Mary Evans, which 
certainly played a great part in Coleridge's 
earlier life. Reviewing the letters of this period, 
it seems pretty plain that, after leaving Christ's 
Hospital and on going down to Cambridge, the 
erstwhile " inspired charity-boy " and docile 
scholar became a decided scapegrace. We read 
of wild pranks and profane revels ; of a riotous 
wine-party (one out of many, probably) at 
which " three or four freshmen were most de- 
plorably drunk "; of " swinging impositions for 
cutting morning chapel "; of a symposium at 
which " Ned, Tatuin, and I sat from four till 



ten drinking"; of a party of six undergrad- 
uates (with himself as " General ") who " sal- 
lied forth to an apothecary's house to thrash 
him for having performed so speedy a cure " 
on an obnoxious tutor, who had been half 
drowned in a duck-pond. It is certain, too, 
that his ultra-liberal opinions brought him into 
some discredit with the College authorities. In 
short, the plain prose of the matter seems to 
be that Coleridge, getting into debt with the 
Cambridge tradesmen and into hot water with 
the Cambridge authorities, fled to London, was 
coolly treated (and possibly rejected) by Miss 
Evans, and, seeing no royal road out of his 
troubles, took the " Queen's shilling," and 
joined a dragoon regiment. A letter to his 
brother says : 

"My assumed name is Silas Tomkyn Comberbacke, 
15th, or King's Regiment of Light Dragoons. My 
number I do not know. The bounty I received was six 
guineas and a half; but a light horseman's bounty is a 
mere lure; it is expended for him in things he must 
have had without a bounty gaiters, a pair of leather 
breeches, stable jacket and shell. . . . There will be a 
large draught from our regiment to complete our troops 
abroad. The men were picked out to-day. I suppose 
I am not one, being a very indocile equestrian." 

An " indocile equestrian " he certainly was ; 
for we read in a later letter : " Within this 
week I have been thrown three times from my 
horse, and run away with, to the no small per- 
turbation of my nervous system, almost every 
day." Coleridge's four-months' dragoonship 
was, of course, a farce ; and he seems to have 
been finally relegated by his superiors to the 
hospital to nurse his sick comrades, with whom 
he became vastly popular. The pretty story 
that his release came about through the inter- 
vention of an officer who became aware of his 
classical attainments is largely myth Miss 
Mitford's " Captain Ogle " appearing nowhere 
in the letters, which show plainly enough that 
the penitent trooper himself took the initiative, 
writing the most plaintive and self-accusing 
letters to his brothers, who finally obtained his 
discharge. 

Coleridge's ill-starred marriage with Sarah 
Fricker, for which Southey (not Heaven, cer- 
tainly) was largely responsible, was part and 
parcel of the famous " Pantisocracy " project 
which was hatched during a visit of Coleridge's 
to Oxford in the summer of 1794. The essen- 
tials of that promising scheme were, as stated 
by Poole : 

" Twelve gentlemen of good education and liberal 
principles were to embark with twelve ladies in April 
next, fixing themselves in some delightful part of the 
new back settlements of America. The labor of each

man for two or three hours a day, it was imagined, 
would suffice to support the colony. The produce was 
to be common property, there was to be a good library, 
and the ample leisure was to be devoted to study, dis- 
cussion, and to the education of the children on a 
settled system. . . . Among other matters not yet de- 
termined was whether the marriage contract was to be 
dissolved, if agreeable to one or both parties." 

The Susquehanna was chosen as an eligible site 
for the colony, partly because of its musical 
name, and partly because of " its security from 
hostile Indians and bisons " ; and the three 
chief "Pantisocrats" Coleridge, Southey, and 
Lovell were to marry the three Miss Frick- 
ers, of Bristol, as a step preliminary to emi- 
gration. Coleridge, with his usual prudence, 
fell in with the matrimonial part of the plan, 
in spite of the fact (amply proved by his let- 
ters) that he still loved his Christ's Hospital 
flame, Mary Evans. A letter written during 
his Welsh vacation tour, a few weeks before 
his engagement to Miss Fricker, contains this 
passage : 

"At Wrexham Church I glanced upon the face of 
Miss E. She turned excessively pale; she thought it 
was my ghost, I suppose. I retreated with all possible 
speed to our inn. There, as I was standing at the win- 
dow, passed by Eliza Evans, and with her to my utter 
surprise her sister, Mary, quam efflictim et perdite ama- 
bam. . . . I turned sick, and all but fainted away! . . . 
Viv it, sed mihi non vivit nova forte marita, 
Ah, dolor! alterius card a cervice pependit. 
Vos, malefida valete accensce insomnia mentis, 
Littora amata valete! Vale, ah! formosa Maria! 
Almighty God bless her! Her image is in the sanc- 
tuary of my heart, and never can it be torn away but 
with the strings that grapple it to life." 

A few weeks after the date of this epistle 
the distracted lover engaged himself to Sarah 
Fricker, and two months after it he wrote as 
follows to Southey from Cambridge : 

". . . My God! how tumultuous are the movements 
of my heart. Since I quitted this room what and how 
important events have been evolved! America! Southey! 
Miss Fricker! Yes, Southey, you are right. Even Love 
is the creature of strong motive. I certainly love her 
[i.e., Miss Fricker]. I think of her incessantly and with 
unspeakable tenderness with that inward melting 
away of soul that symptomatizes it. Pantisocracy ! Oh, 
I shall have such a scheme of it! My head, my heart, 
are all alive. I have drawn up my arguments in battle 
array; they shall have the tactician excellence of the 
mathematician, with the enthusiasm of the poet. The 
head shall be the mass; the heart the fiery spirit that 
fills, informs, and agitates the whole." 

This letter is dated July ; and in the follow- 
ing December Coleridge quitted Cambridge 
for good, and hastened straight not to Bris- 
tol, and " Pantisocracy," and Miss Fricker, but 
to London, where he joined Lamb, and spent 
with him those ambrosial evenings (immortal- 



ized in Lamb's letters) at the " Salutation and 
Cat," " drinking egg-hot and smoking Oro- 
nooko," and discussing the principles of poesy. 
And there he might have remained indefinitely ; 
for the landlord of the " Salutation " was so 
charmed with his talk (or with the sound of 
it) that he offered to lodge him gratis so long 
as he chose to stay. Not a line did Coleridge 
write to Southey in the meantime, not a word to 
Miss Fricker ; until at last Southey, growing 
uneasy, posted down to London, captured the 
truant, and fetched him back to Bristol, where 
he at once resumed the role of ardent lover 
and Pantisocrat. Coleridge married Sarah 
Fricker on October 4, 1795 ; and the results 
of the ill-assorted union were what might have 
been expected. Things went on well for a time, 
for there was certainly some attachment be- 
tween the pair ; but the inevitable estrange- 
ment came, and grew ; and with it 

" those habitual ills 

That wear out life, when two unequal minds 
Meet in one house, and two discordant wills." 

Coleridge's gradual drifting away and final 
separation from his family amounted to, as we 
have said, nothing less than a desertion of them ; 
and he alone, for anything that has ever been 
shown to the contrary, was to blame. The 
only fault as a wife that has been charged 
against Mrs. Coleridge is that she was some- 
times "fretful"! That she was no more than 
that, must be credited to her as a virtue ; for 
her gifted spouse, with all his genius, with all 
his soaring ideals of human conduct, would, in 
his conjugal character, assuredly have put a 
Griselda to the proof. 

While the period spent at Nether-Stowey 
(1797-8), in the bracing companionship of 
the Wordsworths, may be accounted Cole- 
ridge's literary annus mirabilis, it is perhaps 
to the closing years at Highgate that one looks 
with most satisfaction. They were years of 
comparative fruitfulness and well-being, of 
calm after storm, a long life's-evening, as it 
were, of returning sunshine, when the clouds 
that had darkened the noontide of his life had 
at last " outwept their rain." The friendship 
and loving-kindness that followed Coleridge all 
his days, and which furnish the best proof of 
the golden qualities (irrespective of his poetic 
genius) that mingled with the clay of his 
nature, found their culmination in the devotion 
of the Gillmans. To this worthy pair he truly 
owed the " crown of his cup and garnish of his 
dish," a welcome that lasted till the day of his 
death.

Mr. Coleridge's editing is all that can be 
desired, painstaking, thorough, and helpful. 
The volumes are provided with an ample ed- 
itorial apparatus, in the way of introduction, 
notes, lists of authorities and of " principal 
events," etc. ; and they are excellent specimens 
of book-making. Altogether, the work is one 
which no Coleridgean's library, certainly, 
should be without. 



THE STORY OF THE AMEKICAX PEOPLE.* 

The undertaking of Mr. McMaster to do for 
the people of the United States what Mr. Green 
did for our kinsfolk of England is evidently 
proving a larger one than was at first planned, 
since the subordinate line on the title-page of 
previous volumes, " In five volumes," has given 
place in the fourth instance to " In six vol- 
umes "; and when the reader finds that the 
history so far published completes the study 
only to 1821, it seems likely that " In seven 
volumes " may yet be found before the object- 
ive point, the Civil War, is reached. But even 
if the trying years between 1821 and 1861 
should require four extra volumes, there would 
be no complaint from any source, so interesting 
does the history of our people become when 
the story is told by a writer so entertaining as 
is Mr. McMaster. 

The period covered by this fourth volume is 
a sort of desert waste, the oases being few and 
far between. Consequently the reader fails to 
find the usual refreshment. There is little to 
be proud of in the battles of the second war 
with England. The closing scene of the third 
volume was the disgraceful surrender of Que- 
bec, when a cowardly general sacrificed his men 
without an attempt at fighting. In the fourth 
book the humiliating story is continued, of 
store-clothed generals, who issued blustering 
proclamations, and in periphrastic braggadocio 
declared what they were going to do, but who 
lacked every element of success, and were so 
ill-trained in the use of weapons, that when, to 
test their relative greatness, they resorted to 
the duel, they were unable to kill or even hit 
each other at the usual duelling distance. 

Not more entertaining is the account of the 
hurried surrender of certain Atlantic coast 
towns on the appearance of a small force of 
raiders, or of the acts of other places in paying

money and giving stores to the enemy on prom- 
ise of exemption from destruction. The climax 
of the whole war was reached, when, with not 
a bit of credit to the British invaders, the 
national capital was sacked, the public build- 
ings destroyed, and the officials of government 
compelled to flee, the President's wife, the jolly 
Dolly Madison, appearing braver than her hus- 
band ; but even she was refused shelter by the 
panic-stricken men, who ran when they saw 
smoke, and were filled with terror when they 
heard of a red-coat. The summary says : 

" In Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, there 
were then living not far from one and a half millions 
of whites. Yet this great population remained in its 
towns and cities, and suffered five thousand English- 
men to spend five weeks in its midst without ever once 
attempting to drive the invaders from the soil." 

Mr. McMaster presents nothing new about 
this war with England ; he makes no attempt 
to find heroes in our army ; he simply tells the 
story well, and one gets a clearer notion of the 
conditions in England, the difficulty of getting 
supplies to the front in America, the hopeless 
division of American interests, and the utter 
failure of our cause on land. Even the glori- 
ous victory at New Orleans, after the peace was 
made, does not efface the record of defeat, how- 
ever grateful it was at the time to the sorely 
burdened Republicans, who had looked in vain 
for solace. 

The naval history is well told, the great 
achievements of our sailors receiving a proper 
recognition without unnecessary adulation. 
The various " ship-duels " are accompanied 
with diagrams, and the reader may follow the 
successive moves of the contending vessels, 
thanking Mr. Roosevelt for his courtesy in 
lending these graphic aids. Of course every 
American citizen knows the story of Perry, but 
the magnitude of his victory appears more 
clearly when the difficulties in his way are stud- 
ied under the guidance of Mr. McMaster. The 
Americans did show some degree of activity in 
gathering supplies and making entrenchments, 
and we feel grateful for these things, even 
though we are told to lay aside the legend of 
the cotton-bales in the fight of the eighth of 
January. 

But the volume is particularly valuable for 
the things which are told about internal devel- 
opment. The fifty pages of Chapter XXXIII., 
"The Routes of Transportation," are replete 
with interest. The wonderful westward move- 
ment of population, which brought Indiana and 
Illinois into the Union within three years after

the close of the war ; the growth of Mississippi 
Valley trade ; the struggles of the commercial 
interests to overcome the difficulties of trans- 
portation, such subjects as these are dis- 
cussed as only Mr. McMaster can treat them. 
Sometimes the desire for home and fortune in 
the West was overpowering. 

."A family of eight, on their way from Maine to 
Indiana, walked all the way to Easton, Pennsylvania, 
which they reached late in February, dragging the chil- 
dren and their worldly goods in a hand-cart. A black- 
smith from Rhode Island made his way in the dead of 
winter across Massachusetts to Albany. In a little cart 
on four plank wheels a foot in diameter were some 
clothes, some food, and two children. Behind it 
trudged the mother with an infant at the breast and 
seven other children beside her. The father and a boy 
of twelve pulled the cart. A family of seven passed 
through Bridgeport, Connecticut, in March. They had 
come down from Three Rivers, in Canada, the men 
drawing a small cart on four plank wheels and the 
women and larger children following on foot. Yet 
another family, consisting of man, wife, and five chil- 
dren, passed through Woodbury, New Jersey, with all 
their household goods in a wheelbarrow. They were 
walking to Ohio. Still another couple with seven chil- 
dren were so destitute that the man carried his property 
on his back." 

Such instances were exceptional, of course, 
but they indicate the determination of the peo- 
ple, and suggest the thought of the very large 
number who made the journey under more favor- 
able auspices. Improved means of communi- 
cation became necessary, and the steamboat 
began to be used. The " teamboat " was a 
peculiar stage of development, motive power for 
boats being furnished by eight horses walking 
in a circle on deck and turning a crank, this 
peculiar power being used in rebuke to the 
steam monopoly. Earlier in the volume, Mr. 
McMaster gives a very entertaining account of 
the difficulties of commerce during the Embargo, 
when horses and oxen were used along the coast 
highways. " Captain Jinks of the Horse Ma- 
rines " appears before us, as we read of the 
arrival and departure of wagons, announced in 
the ship-news column of the newspaper, under 
the heading " Horse-Marine Intelligence "; and 
the native humor of the people is shown in the 
banners fastened to these poor substitutes for 
the Yankee vessel, " Free Trade and Teamsters' 
Eights," " Free Trade and Oxen's Rights," or 
" No Impressment." But, whether the diffi- 
culties of communication came from war or 
from the wilderness, the Americans were bound 
to overcome them, and their success was shown 
by the increase of commerce and wealth of the 
new states of the West and Southwest. 

The troubles with the Southern Indians and 



with Spain are well described, the personality 
of Andrew Jackson being prominent, of course ; 
and the busy years of internal development 
following the second war furnish many special 
topics for discussion. Two of these are wor- 
thy of particular mention, because the facts 
have not been easily accessible to the ordinary 
reader before : the full statement about the 
wild-cat banking of the new Western common- 
wealths, and the story of the religious and phi- 
lanthropic societies, which planned for the 
white man, who was deprived of the privileges 
of religion belonging to a member of a settled 
neighborhood, and for the black man, who was 
led to look toward Africa for home and free- 
dom. And the development of the humanitarian 
ideas was shown none the less in the move- 
ments for reform in the penal system of the 
country, if, indeed, the word system could be 
used of what seemed hopelessly bad. 

The complexity of American life during the 
period covered by this volume is sufficient rea- 
son for the adoption of the topical method of 
treatment by Mr. McMaster, although it might 
seem that there was a failure to show things in 
their relation to other happenings. But even 
this mild criticism does not take away the im- 
pression created by an examination of the vol- 
ume, that careful work has been done by the 
author, and that the fourth book holds its own 
with those previously published.

A NEW TREATMENT or ENGLISH 
LITERARY HISTORY.* 



The symmetrical and self-centred develop- 
ment of French thought has always been one 
of its most marked characteristics, and French 
literature has thereby been given a unity not 
presented, except for brief periods, by the lit- 
eratures of other modern nations. There has 
been something almost Hellenic in its confident 
assumption that the final cause of the ideas of 
other peoples was to be found in its own adop- 
tion of those ideas, that through a Gallic re- 
mintage alone they might be given full cur- 
rency and exchange value. This assumption, 
viewed from one side, is mere provincialism if 
not chauvinism ; viewed from another, it ex- 
presses a deep artistic sense of the importance 
of preserving the national spirit from the dis-

integrating influence of alien ideals. The finest 
French thought, from the age of the Great 
Monarch to that which has witnessed the per- 
manent triumph of the republican principle, 
has shown a strong instinct of self-preservation 
in this respect ; it has not been wholly imper- 
vious to foreign influences, but it has welcomed 
them only upon condition of complete assim- 
ilation. 

The most careless observer, however, cannot 
have failed to notice in the French thought of 
the past few years a significant change of atti- 
tude towards the foreigner. While by no means 
abandoning the old national ideal, the modern 
Frenchman lends a more willing ear than for- 
merly to the words of his European neighbors ; 
his interest in what they are doing and saying 
is no longer the mere polite curiosity of old, 
but has become genuine and absorbing ; a 
catholicity of taste, almost to be described as 
eager, has replaced the old narrow indifference. 
The force of chauvinism, if still unspent in 
political and social affairs, has lost its power 
to resist the invasion of the educational, artistic, 
and literary ideals of the rest of Europe. The 
preaching of Taine and Renan is bearing fruit, 
both in its amplification by such of the younger 
men as M. Lavisse, M. Bourget, and the Vi- 
comte de Vogue, and in the widening outlook al- 
ready gained by a large proportion of cultivated 
Frenchmen. Never has lesson been so taken 
to heart as that of Sedan, in witness whereof 
stands the great monument of the national ed- 
ucational system, erected within the past quar- 
ter century. Never, perhaps, has the innate 
artistic sense of a people won so complete a tri- 
umph over national or academic prejudice as in 
the recent enthusiastic acceptance of the music- 
dramas of Richard Wagner. In this case, the 
words of Tennyson, 

" We needs must love the highest when we see it," 

find a new application, in the highest degree 
creditable to the people in whose honor they 
are now recalled. 

Noticeable among the manifestations of the 
increase of French interest in the achievements 
of other nations is the attention recently paid to 
English literature by a number of competent 
scholars. In this field the path was many years 
ago marked out by Taine, whose great history 
of our letters, in spite of its obvious faults and 
its doctrinaire method, remains the most im- 
portant general treatment of the subject any- 
where yet produced. Of late years the study 
of English literature has been taken very seri- 
ously by the French faculties of letters, and 



many important monographs upon special 
phases of the subject have been published. The 
modern French student of literature is no 
longer content, as formerly, with a few superfi- 
cial notions of Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron, 
but is beginning to learn something about 
many others of our writers, from Chaucer to 
Tennyson, and to follow the lead of Taine in 
the study of tendencies and formative agencies 
in the growth of the English national spirit. 
The trend and the thoroughness of the new 
training are well exemplified by such books as 
M. Rabbe's study of Shelley, M. Chevrillon's 
study of Sydney Smith, and the twelve hundred 
pages of M. Angelier's study of Burns ; by M. 
Beljame's work on English men of letters in 
the eighteenth century, and M. Jusserand's 
" Piers Plowman," " English Wayfaring Life 
in the Middle Ages," and " The English Novel 
in the Time of Shakespeare." Such works as 
these, honorable to the scholarship of any na- 
tion, are peculiarly gratifying to us of English 
speech, for their production seems to presage 
a closer linking together of the two modern lit- 
eratures that have chiefly influenced the thought 
and the civilization of the world. 

The works of M. Jusserand already men- 
tioned have given to their author perhaps the 
foremost place among living French students 
of English literature, and prepared us in a way 
for the more ambitious and comprehensive 
book which has occasioned the present article. 
That book is called " A Literary History of 
the English People," and will, when completed, 
fill three large volumes. The one now pub- 
lished covers the period " From the Origins to 
the Renaissance," the second will carry the his- 
tory on to Pope, and the third will bring it 
down to the present day. We are not at pres- 
ent called upon to pronounce final judgment 
upon an undertaking of which but a third is 
yet offered us, yet we cannot refrain from say- 
ing that, as the complete work will be compar- 
able in dimensions with Taine's monumental 
history, it would seem, from the section now 
at hand, to give promise of being equally com- 
parable in quality ; that is, in scholarship, sym- 
pathy, discernment, and philosophical grasp. 

The differentiation of M. Jusserand's work 
from the conventional history of literature 
may best be described in the author's words. 
" Diminishing somewhat in his book the part 
usually allowed to technicalities and aesthetic 
problems," he has increased " the part allotted 
to the people and to the nation." For a writer 
with this general object in view, " the ages

during which the national thought expressed 
itself in languages which were not the na- 
tional one, will not be allowed to remain blank, 
as if, for complete periods, the inhabitants of 
the island had ceased to think at all. The 
growing into shape of the people's genius 
will have to be studied with particular atten- 
tion." The theory thus expressed is well illus- 
trated by the present volume devoted to the 
origins ; and so rich and suggestive a treatment 
of the Saxon, and especially the Norman pe- 
riod, is hardly to be found in the work of any 
other historian. We find here a more intimate 
association of the literature with customs, pol- 
itics, and institutions than was given us even 
by Taine, and admiration of the author's schol- 
arship is evoked by wellnigh every page. The 
Norman period, in particular, is made an inte- 
gral part of our intellectual development, in- 
stead of being regarded as a period of alien 
influences, active for a time, but leaving slight 
impress upon our literature as a whole. In 
this field, the author makes large use of the 
immense riches of recent French philological 
scholarship, even quoting from review articles 
of the past few months. The continuity of 
English thought, as embodied in its literature, 
is a fundamental conception of this work, and 
the unconscious embodiments are given their 
full value. 

" Philosophers and reformers must be questioned con- 
cerning the theories which they spread: and not with- 
out some purely literary advantage. Bacon, Hobbes, 
and Locke are the ancestors of many poets who have 
never read their works, but who have breathed an air 
impregnated with their thought. Dreamers will be fol- 
lowed, singers, tale-tellers, and preachers, wherever it 
pleases them to lead us: to the Walhalla of the north, 
to the green dales of Erin, to the Saxon church of Brad- 
ford-on-Avon, to Blackheath, to the ' Tabard ' and the 
'Mermaid,' to the 'Globe,' to 'Will's' coffee-house, 
among ruined fortresses, to cloud-reaching steeples, or 
along the furrow sown to good intent by Piers the hon- 
est Plowman." 

A few words may be given to matters that 
have particularly attracted our attention dur- 
ing the examination of this volume, or matters 
that involve critical problems in their treat- 
ment. Mr. Grant Allen will thank the author 
for his insistence upon the Celtic element in our 
English race ; on the other hand, the Scandi- 
navian element in the race of the conquering 
Normans is minimized, unduly, we should say, 
when we come upon the statement that " they 
no longer had anything Scandinavian or Ger- 
manic about them." But M. Jusserand does 
not exaggerate the significance of the Conquest, 
or of the fact that after 1066, the inhabitants 



of England, " so used to invasions, were never 
again to see rise, from that day to this, the 
smoke of an enemy's camp." We might carp 
a little at this statement, but it remains essen- 
tially true. A characteristic as well as deeply 
interesting example of the author's scent for 
literary parallelisms is offered by this quotation 
from a twelfth century lyric : 

" II n'est mie jors, saverouze au eors gent, 
Si m'ait amors, 1'alouete nos ment," 

which was the way " in which, long before 
Shakespeare, the Juliets of the time of Henry 
II. said to their Romeos : 

' It is not yet near day, 
It was the nightingale and not the lark.' " 

But not content with this, the author refers us 
still farther back, to a Chinese poem antedat- 
ing the seventh century, where the same motif 
appears in this form : " It was not the cock, it 
was the hum of flies." 

M. Jusserand's work is one to be readily 
quoted from, but our indulgence in that pleas- 
ant task is forbidden by the limitations of 
space. Having piloted us, as guide, philoso- 
pher, and friend, through the intricate chan- 
nels of the formative period, the author at last 
reaches the open sea of Chaucer, with compar- 
atively plain sailing ahead. The chapters on 
Chaucer and Langland are lovingly written, 
and no English historian has surpassed them 
in charm. A long chapter on the beginnings 
of the drama, and a short one on " The End 
of the Middle Ages," bring the volume to a 
close. The Eastern Empire has succumbed 
to the onslaughts of the Turk ; classical schol- 
ars and manuscripts have started on their benef- 
icent mission to the civilization of the West ; 
the quickened life of the Renaissance is trans- 
forming Italy and France ; the English people 
are on the eve of the great flowering period 
of their national genius ; and we await the sec- 
ond instalment of M. Jusserand's work, confi- 
dent that he will be equal to the demands made 
upon him by even u the spacious times of great 
Elizabeth." 

It is not easy to do justice in a brief review 
to the manifold charms of this work. There 
is the charm of full knowledge and ripe judg- 
ment, the charm that comes from a treatment 
always fresh, however hackneyed the theme, 
the charm that comes from playing allusively 
about a subject and adorning it with illustrat- 
ive material from the greatest variety of sources, 
and, finally, the charm of an English style 
which we hesitate in attributing to any mere 
translator. Either the author has rewritten his

own book in English, or he has been singularly 
happy in the one to whom the preparation of the 
English text was entrusted. And those who 
entertain a chronic suspicion that graceful writ- 
ing means superficiality of attainment and the 
lack of exact knowledge will be reassured 
by a glance at the footnotes, to which all 
the erudition has been relegated, and of which 
the most pedantic and industrious of German 
scholars would have no cause to be ashamed.

WOMAN'S SHARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF CULTURE.* 



The initiative volume of the promising " An- 
thropological Series," edited by Professor Fred- 
erick Starr, is a successful attempt, by Mr. Otis 
T. Mason, to present clearly, and in compact 
form, the part which woman has played in the 
development of the culture of the world. 

The idea prevails that woman in savagery 
and in barbarism knows nothing but drudgery 
and cruelty. That this has not been and can- 
not have been true, the author easily shows. 
"It is not reasonable to suppose that any 
species or variety of animals would survive in 
which the helpless maternal half is subjected to 
outrageous cruelty as a rule." Again, "cruelty 
does not breed refinement either of manners 
or of taste." The earliest division of labor was 
based upon sex. Woman had certain duties ; 
man had certain other duties. The line between 
the two was as definitely drawn in savagery as 
it is in civilization, though on a different basis. 
Many kinds of labor which in lower forms of 
society are performed by women, in civilization 
are largely in the hands of men. The idea that 
savage or barbarous woman is cruelly treated, 
and is compelled to do all the work for the fam- 
ily, is due partly to a misconception of the or- 
ganization of primitive society, and partly to 
observation of it under unusual or abnormal 
conditions. A careful reading of Mr. Mason's 
book will make much clearer the real position 
of woman outside of civilization. 

On woman, as the " food-bringer," fell the 
duty of providing a large part of the food. She 
gathered fruits, seeds, and other parts of plants, 
and prepared them for food. Later, she learned 
to cultivate plants, and became the first farmer. 
For the grinding of fruits and seeds the mortar

Mason. (The Anthropological Series.) New York : D. Ap- 
pleton & Co. 



and the mill-stone were invented. Woman was 
then the first miller. After the grain was har- 
vested, it must be protected from vermin ; so the 
cat was domesticated. The part which man 
played in the food-quest was in providing game. 
But the woman brought it into camp, removed 
the skin, and prepared the flesh either for im- 
mediate consumption or to be kept for future 
use. The author interestingly describes many 
primitive methods of preparing food, some fol- 
lowed to-day, others no longer used. 

Another of woman's occupations was as the 
"skin-dresser." All of the many uses to which 
leather is now put have come from the humble 
beginning which woman made. " If aught in 
the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or 
in the waters, wore a skin, savage women were 
found, on examination, to have had a name for 
it, and to have succeeded in turning it into its 
primitive use for human clothing." Various 
methods of treating skins are described, and 
the tools used in the processes are illustrated. 
In this connection an interesting illustration of 
the conservatism of woman is noted. Men have 
for the most part ceased to wear furs, while 
women still continue " to use up nearly all the 
harvest of wild skins that are obtained." 

Again, woman has been the " beast of bur- 
den." It is perhaps in this capacity, in bar- 
barism, that she has aroused the most pity ; 
although it may be questioned whether much 
of this pity is not wasted. The account of the 
development of the carrying trade " from wom- 
an's back to the car and the stately ship," is 
one of the best parts of the book. Methods of 
carrying children, cradle-frames, the parts of 
the body used in burden-bearing, and devices 
for sustaining the weight, are all discussed. 
Woman has been, too, " The Weaver," " The 
Potter," " The Jack-at-all-trades," " The Art- 
ist," " The Linguist," " The Founder of So- 
ciety," " The Patron of Eeligion." 

The author's style is occasionally poetic and 
too often faulty. For example : 

" One sunny day a company of savage women were 
alternately chatting and chipping in a soapstone quarry, 
when it occurred to one of them to leave a bit of the 
stone projecting here and there for legs. Happy 
thought ! No sooner said than done. And after that 
all soapstone pots had legs " (p. 34). 

Again, in speaking of the spirit world, he says : 
" How unspeakably near must such a world of spirits 
be to women like unto these ! They walk hourly 
among the gods. Heaven does not so much come down 
their souls to greet, as they exist on a narrow island 
between the two oceans, indistinguishable to their un- 
tutored minds" (p. 242).

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Other like instances might be given. The value 
of the book, however, lies in the new point of 
view from which culture -history is studied. 
The earliest division of labor is kept constantly 
in mind, and woman's side only is considered.

SIDE PATHS OF PSYCHOLOGY.* 

In the introductory chapter of any recent work 
upon normal individual psychology will be found 
paragraphs entitled " External Aids and Appli- 
ances." And among " external aids " will be counted 
the light thrown upon special problems by the re- 
sults of investigation in cognate disciplines. Nor- 
mal psychology, it is said, cannot afford to neglect 
the inquiries of abnormal, the discussion of dream- 
ing, hypnosis, and mental derangement; individ- 
ual psychology must take account of comparative, 
and the psychology which treats of the adult mind 
must pay regard to the phenomena of the child 
mind. At present, it must be confessed, this view 
of the matter represents the ideal rather than the 
actual. Normal psychology has advanced so rap- 
idly since the introduction of the experimental 
method, and " systematic psychology " has been so 
considerably modified and clarified by its applica- 
cation to the study of consciousness, that the main 
current has outrun the side streams, the normal 
is better known than the abnormal, the developed 
than the incomplete. Thus, in the books before us, 
Dr. Strahan leaves to the normal psychologist the 
explanation of the facts of connate impulse or in- 
stinct ; Mr. Greenwood naively asks of the physio- 
logical psychologist whether this or that hypothesis 
may, perhaps, be allowable ; Professor Lloyd Mor- 
gan writes in his preface that " Introspective psy- 
chology is an essential preliminary to comparative 
psychology "; and Professor Baldwin, speaking from 
the other side, remarks that " It is astonishing that 
the ' new ' psychology has hitherto made so little 
use " of the genetic conception of mind, and that 
" The question of race psychology " has been, "un- 
til very lately, a greatly neglected question." It is 
well, I think, that emphasis should be laid upon 
these and similar admissions, since those who are

impressed by the enormous bulk of, e. g., hypnotic 
and alienist literature, and who do not either realize 
what a drill-course in experimental psychology does 
for the student or know how to estimate the results 
detailed in psychological monographs, are apt to un- 
dervalue both the progress and the achievement of 
the science at large. 

At the same time, the benefit is not altogether 
one-sided. Dr. Strahan's work on "Suicide and 
Insanity," for instance, lightens the task of the nor- 
mal psychologist by reducing all the various prob- 
lems of suicide to the single problem of impulse. 
The thesis of the volume is that true suicide is one 
and indivisible ; that it is in every instance the out- 
come of the suicidal impulse ; that this impulse is 
very rarely acquired in the lifetime of the individ- 
ual, being in the vast majority of cases " inherited 
from ancestors who have been cultivating it for a 
considerable time in one form or other "; and that 
hereditary transmission involves transmutation, 
the changes being rung upon suicide, insanity, epi- 
lepsy, idiocy, scrofula, cancer, and the like. Rea- 
soned suicide, whether for gain (inspired by religion, 
the desire for notoriety, etc.), or for the escaping 
of evil (physical suffering, disgrace, etc.), is only 
a quasi-suicide, to be treated apart from the irra- 
tional or true form. The latter is always the ex- 
pression of the impulse already spoken of, whether 
the instantaneous expression of a blind, constraining 
desire, or the final manifestation of a gradually de- 
veloped instinct. Only in a small minority of cases 
is it correlated with madness ; no influence of cli- 
mate can be proved ; the fact that it appears most 
frequently in the summer months is to be accounted 
for by the consideration that these months repre- 
sent a period of reaction and comparative exhaus- 
tion after work at high tension, so that " at this 
portion of the yearly cycle " we naturally " meet 
with most breakdowns in the machine "; religion 
and irreligion exert an influence merely by way of 
hygiene ; drunkenness, sexual immorality, and crime 
in general, may predispose to suicide, as " devital- 
izing agents," but do not drive the individual to 
self-destruction ; women are more immune than 
men, because less harassed, more timid, more averse 
to the idea of personal disfigurement, etc.; age is a 
determining factor only as it means more or less 
exposure to occurrences which may serve as ade- 
quate stimuli to the release of the impulse. Each 
race has a certain proclivity to suicide, which seems 
to remain stationary. Within the race, suicide va- 
ries directly with civilization and education. " All 
that goes to make up what we call civilization . . . 
leads to degenerative changes in the human organ- 
ism, and it is from the abnormal condition of con- 
stitution thus acquired that arise true suicide and 
allied evils." " Upon direct propagation depends 
the major part of the increase which has taken 
place in recent years." 

Dr. Strahan's English is often peculiar and origi- 
nal. His pronominal use of " such " would appeal 
to Mr. Andrew Lang ; and collocations like " every-

where in which " are distinct additions to the lan- 
guage. Mr. Greenwood, on the other hand, throws 
his studies in morbid psychology into the pleasant 
literary form in which he was wont, once upon a 
time, to couch his political controversies. Two 
essays, one of them published in " The Contempo- 
rary Review " and the other in " The New Review," 
are the foundation of his work on " Imagination in 
Dreams." Mr. Greenwood belongs, with Johannes 
Miiller and Alfred Maury, in the class of those who 
have a strong tendency towards what is called u vis- 
ualisation " or " visual imagination." He sees vis- 
ions and dreams dreams. In his case the visions 
take the form of faces : type-faces, not remembered 
faces. " They are never seen except when the eye- 
lids are closed, and have an apparent distance of 
five or six feet. Though they seem living enough, 
they look through the darkness as if traced in chalks 
on a black ground. Color sometimes they have, 
but the color is very faint. Indeed, their general 
aspect is as if their substance were of pale smoke ; 
... so that, except for the half of a moment, the 
whole face is never clearly or completely visible at 
one time." The account of these personal experi- 
ences is the most valuable thing, to the psycholo- 
gist, in Mr. Greenwood's volume. It is good raw 
material, which can be used with advantage for the 
theory of visual images and their projection-modes. 
The author is himself a little unfair to psychology. 
" The inquiry " into dreams " is almost invariably 
approached either in the spirit of the old supersti- 
tion or in the new spirit of materialism and mock- 
ery." It is true that scientific psychology will hear 
nothing of spiritism, dream-prediction, telepathy, 
and the like ; and it is true that physiologists refer 
certain dreams to indigestion, a fact which Mr. 
Greenwood takes as a personal insult throughout 
his book. But there is, as a matter of fact, a fairly 
large array of monographic literature, which deals 
with the origination and course of dreaming. 

The central object of Professor Lloyd Morgan's 
" Introduction to Comparative Psychology " is " to 
discuss the relation of the psychology of man to 
that of the higher animals." The author seeks to 
attain this object by a method of duplicate present- 
ment. Thus, Chapter IV. treats of suggestion and 
association in man, V., of the association of ideas 
in animals, VIII. and IX., of the analysis, synthe- 
sis, and correlation of impressions in man, X., of 
the sense-experience of animals, XIII. deals with 
the perception of relations by ourselves, XIV. asks 
whether animals perceive relations ; and so on. The 
writing of a comparative psychology on these lines 
obviously implies the writing of a human psychology ; 
and it is evident that the method has many disad- 
vantages. Two books have to be crowded into the 
compass of one ; the human psychology tends to 
become secondary, and to deal only with topics 
which lend themselves readily to comparative treat- 
ment ; and the chapters which treat of the animal 
mind may very well be made discursive, by the au- 



thor's desire to assist the reader, to save him the 
trouble of constant back-references. Professor 
Morgan shows considerable skill in the avoidance 
of these difficulties. His exposition is full, clear, 
and fair ; and he has never forgotten that his book 
is to serve as an introduction to the subject. It is, 
however, unfortunate that he, like Professor Ro- 
manes, should be bound by the chains of a psycho- 
logical system which, despite its historical import- 
ance, is now in many respects out of date. The 
human psychology which he offers is avowedly 
Spencerian ; and, indeed, one need read no more 
than the table of contents to trace the influence of 
the " Principles of Psychology." Associationism is 
a good psychological position. But analysis has 
progressed of late years by leaps and bounds ; and 
its results must be recognized by those who under- 
take to interpret the animal consciousness. Pro- 
fessor Morgan admits this principle : " Throughout 
the whole of these objective investigations, the wise 
and cautious student never forgets that the inter- 
pretation of the facts in psychical terms is based 
upon the inductions he has reached through intro- 
spection." It may be that he would affiliate his 
animal psychology to some more recent outgrowth 
of the associationist doctrine, were he writing for 
psychologists von Fach and not for the general 
public. 

In the first part of his " Mental Development in 
the Child and the Race," Professor Baldwin diverges 
widely from the traditional lines of psychogenetic 
discussion, as laid down by Preyer and others. The 
book has a theory to support. Its title might not 
unfairly be amended to run : " The Importance of 
the Motor Consciousness, as illustrated in the De- 
velopment of the Child and the Race." The author 
emphasizes the motor elements in mental evolution, 
and thus introduces into psychogenesis a point of 
view which is eminently characteristic of modern 
psychology and psychophysics, witness the James- 
Lange theory of emotion, Kiilpe's recent analysis 
of impulse, or Miinsterberg's explanation of pleas- 
antness and unpleasantness. The first six chapters 
are " devoted to the statement of the genetic prob- 
lem, with reports of the facts of infant life, and the 
methods of investigating them, and the mere teas- 
ing out of the strings of law upon which the facts 
are beaded," suggestion, habit, accommodation, etc. 
The author begins by noting the advantages offered 
by the simple, unreflective consciousness of the child 
to psychological investigation. He then describes 
experiments in which the immediate dynamogenic 
effect of an impression is turned to account for the 
determination of color recognition and right-hand- 
edness. The development of imitation is traced in 
writing and drawing ; and suggestion is made re- 
sponsible for all acts in the half-conscious begin- 
nings of life, and for many phenomena of the sub- 
conscious adult activity. Chapters VII. and VIII. 
give a general formulation of the theory of adapta- 
tion. Survival and development depend not only 



326 



THE DIAL

on passive adaptation to environment, but on the 
ability to react to pleasure-giving stimuli in a man- 
ner which ensures the maximal continuance of the 
beneficial stimulation. Habit must be supplemented 
by accommodation. Emotional expression is a 
dynamogenic effect of mental states ; emotion itself 
is largely " a revival product, a clustering, so to 
speak, of organic and muscular reverberations about 
revived elements of content." The rest of the book 
details the genetic view of " the process of mental 
development in its great stages, Memory, Asso- 
ciation, Attention, Thought, Self - consciousness, 
Volition." Given contractility and environment, 
and we have " organic imitation." It develops, by 
the general law of pleasure-pain reactions, into the 
complex states of assimilation, recognition, etc. All 
these processes, together with the principle of iden- 
tity, the distinction between perception and concep- 
tion, etc., are made almost exclusively dependent on 
motor phenomena. " Motor habit is the great devour- 
ing thing which throws its arms round all mental 
details, and unifies them in its embrace." Chapter 
XII. contains some well-chosen rules for the observ- 
ation of the evolution of imitation in children. This 
summary sketch can give no idea of the variety of 
topics which Professor Baldwin handles, or of the 
originality with which his central thesis is worked 
out. No psychologist can afford to neglect the book, 
and its second part (" Interpretations : Educational, 
Social, and Ethical ") will be eagerly expected. 

We pass from Professor Baldwin's first word 
upon his " Genetic System " to what is, in all prob- 
ability, Professor Ladd's last word upon psychol- 
ogy in general : the " Philosophy of Mind." The 
work is concerned with three principal problems : 
the relation of psychology to philosophy, the nature 
of mind, and the relation of mind to body. Every 
science, as we know, has its own methodological 
assumptions, which may be said to constitute its 
special metaphysics. Professor Ladd maintains that 
the working assumptions of psychology are too 
nearly allied to the ultimate philosophical ontology 
to be allowed to remain implicit only. Psychology 
should take its stand frankly upon a metaphysical 
basis, and the aid of metaphysics be invoked for 
psychological explanation. The author is a veteran 
worker in both of the fields which he reviews in the 
present volume, and his conclusions are entitled to 
our utmost respect. But just because of his own 
familiarity with the fundamental issues, it may be 
that he underrates the difficulty of metaphysical 
thought to the beginner in psychology. To grasp 
the meaning of mind as a real being, real enough 
to interact causally with the body, yet not to be 
looked upon as a " soul " in the ordinary signifi- 
cance of the term, i.e., as a pure entity, " a statical 
object for its own contemplation," and to under- 
stand that this reality merges every night in the 
World-ground, to emerge as regularly every morn- 
ing, this is surely a most difficult matter for the 
student, whose philosophical training is a matter of 



but a year or two ; and the working hypothesis of 
parallelism has at least its surface straightforward- 
ness to recommend it. Still, it is the author's 
opinion that difficult metaphysics, if good, is pre- 
ferable to crude metaphysics, and the opinion is 
supported by some very effective criticism. The 
work contains chapters on the consciousness of iden- 
tity (to the discussion of which is appended an ex- 
amination of the facts of "double consciousness"), 
on materialism, spiritualism, monism, and dualism, 
and on the place of man's mind in nature ; in addi- 
tion to those which bear more directly on the special 
questions enumerated above (the concept, reality, 
unity, origin and permanence of mind, etc.). Its 
raking attack upon over-hasty monism is particu- 
larly well-timed. 

Although the border-land which divides psychol- 
ogy from metaphysics is partially surveyed in many 
philosophical and psychological works, Professor 
Ladd has for the first time brought the more im- 
portant questions within the limits of a single vol- 
ume. He has done so after many years of oc- 
cupation with the empirical facts of the mental life : 
the " Elements of Physiological Psychology " was 
published in 1887. Hence his insistence upon the 
crucial value and irreducible character of the ex- 
perience of self-activity carries with it a great weight 
of personal authority. The battle between motor 
habit and conation is not yet over. But whether 
Professor Ladd prove to have fought upon the 
weaker or the stronger side, he has done yeoman's 
service to his cause : and his three psychological 
works the " Elements," the " Psychology," and 
the present essay will take a permanent place 
among the standard books of the science.

The myth of 
Marshal Ney 
in America. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

In his " Historic Doubts as to the 
Execution of Marshal Ney" (Whit- 
taker), the Rev. James A. Weston 
has constructed an argument, more vigorous than 
convincing, to prove that this execution was a mock 
affair contrived by the Duke of Wellington in order 
to avenge the humiliating treatment he had received 
from Louis XVIII. when he went to the palace, as 
is alleged, to ask the king to spare Ney's life. It 
is highly improbable that Wellington ever had such 
an intention, because the English prime-minister 
had written, " One can never feel that the king is 
secure on his throne until he has dared to spill trai- 
tor's blood "; and, as Fyffe remarks, " when the 
Premier had dug the grave, it was not for Welling- 
ton to rescue the prisoner." Moreover, even con- 
ceding the intention, a humiliation so public 
which Mr. Weston thinks was an insult to England 
and to the allied powers called for a vindication, 
equally public. But a mock execution, which waited 
eighty years to be thoroughly explained, offered no

vindication at all. Still, as " Wellington could not 
have permitted the atrocious butchery," for so 
Mr. Weston declares, what did become of Ney ? 
For three years he was lost sight of. Then he reap- 
peared in South Carolina, transformed into a coun- 
try schoolmaster, and something of a pedant, for 
he said he could "read and converse" in Latin, 
Greek, and Hebrew, as well as Scotch, French, 
Italian, Russian, and Polish. Curiously enough, he 
seems to have spoken with a distinct Scotch-Irish 
brogue. He had partially disguised his name as P. 
S. Ney, since he was anxious to keep his identity a 
secret. The name Ney he had retained " because 
no one would expect him to take it," and it would 
therefore be " his best foil against suspicion or 
recognition." It seems to have been the practice 
of this military pedagogue to tell his story chiefly to 
schoolchildren. Nevertheless, " occasionally, when 
stirred by intoxicants, he would publicly declare 
that he was Marshal Ney." The reason why he 
became a teacher is interesting, doubly so because 
he explained the matter himself " twice, when per- 
fectly sober." He chose " the profession of teach- 
ing," he declared, " because it was in many respects 
like the military profession. . . . He could not bear 
the thought of engaging in any occupation where 
he would be commanded or controlled by others. 
In the school-room he would be supreme," etc. Even 
after the Revolution of July, he fed the credulous 
with the absurd notion that were his whereabouts 
known in France his enemies would send over and 
assassinate him. He seems to have spent his leisure 
composing lame verses, which he called " Original 
Poetry," and twenty pages or so of which Mr. Wes- 
ton quotes, with the result that Ney's admirers will 
now hope more strongly than ever that he actually 
did die gloriously on that December day in 1815. 
But, says one of Mr. Weston's multitude of wit- 
nesses whose testimony in regard to P. S. Ney he 
has patiently collected, it is "more difficult to say 
who he [P. S. Ney] was than to believe he was 
Marshal Ney." If this be the case he must have 
been an interesting impostor. 

Maria Edgeworth was a much more 
yMis S d Edgeworth. important figure to the preceding 

generation than she is in ours. " The 
Parent's Assistant," "Moral Tales," "Belinda," 
" Castle Rackrent," comparatively unknown to pres- 
ent-day readers, were not only the delight of the 
average reader half a century ago, but served as 
inspiration to no less a man than Sir Walter Scott, 
who testified that it was Miss Edgeworth's sketches 
of Irish character that first moved him to write and 
publish novels of his own. But whether or not we 
can now feel much enthusiasm about Miss Edge- 
worth as an author, we discover through the two vol- 
umes of her " Life and Letters " (Houghton) that 
she was a very interesting woman. She was her- 
self an illustration of her own opinion, expressed in 
one of these letters, that " supereminent talents and 
an excellent heart almost always go together." She 



was the beloved eldest sister in a family of twenty- 
one children, the cherished friend and companion 
of three successive stepmothers who followed after 
the death of her own mother, which occurred when 
she was six years old. The bond between father 
and eldest daughter was a peculiarly tender one, 
possibly to the detriment of her literary achieve- 
ments. Although her gifts were far superior to his, 
so long as he lived much of her work was done in 
collaboration with him, and a full sketch of the 
story she was about to write was always required 
by him before she began its elaboration. In the 
wonderfully harmonious family at Edgeworthstown 
House, composed of the children of four different 
mothers and the curious combinations of intricate 
relationships produced by marriage, together with 
the numerous friends, sometimes twenty or thirty 
at a time, who often came upon them unexpectedly, 
but sure of finding a generous hospitality, Maria 
was the central figure. Her desk was in the family 
sitting-room, and most of her literary work was ac- 
complished amid its manifold distractions. Many 
friendships with distinguished people enriched her 
life, notably the one with Sir Walter Scott, result- 
ing in the interchange of visits between Abbotsf ord 
and Edgeworthstown, and an Irish journey together. 
The charms of the conversation of the two story- 
writers may be inferred from the confession of the 
boatman who rowed them over the Lake of Killar- 
ney, and who told Lord Macaulay twenty years 
afterwards that the pleasure of rowing them had 
made him amends for missing a hanging that day. 
Miss Edgeworth's letters are delightfully written ; 
their charm as a whole is somewhat lessened, how- 
ever, by too little discrimination on the part of the 
editor, Mr. Augustus J. C. Hare. In a correspond- 
ence covering a long life of eighty-two years, what 
one wants is not an omnium gatherum, but a judi- 
cious elimination of such letters as deal only with 
matters of no possible interest for any but the per- 
son to whom they are written. 

The Turkish Another in the terrible series of wan- 

outragesin ton massacres, perpetrated by the 

Armenia. Turk upon the defenseless Christian 

subjects of his misrule, brings before the civilized 
nations anew the "Eternal Eastern Question." From 
Armenia this time comes the cry which ought to 
rouse those powers that are responsible for the con- 
tinued existence of Turkish tyranny to some action 
that shall be effective and final. Four times has 
England interfered to save the Ottoman Empire 
from merited destruction, and thus become respon- 
sible before the world for a reform of the abuses 
that have made the lot of the subjects of that Em- 
pire wretched almost beyond description. Yet the 
Turkish government has grown steadily worse, while 
England and her associate powers have been con- 
tent with empty promises and paper constitutions. 
The organized robbery that is called the govern- 
ment of Turkey, and the terrible condition of the 
people, Mohammedans as well as Christians, are

clearly portrayed in Mr. F. D. Greene's little book, 
"The Armenian Crisis in Turkey" (Putnams). 
This is primarily a well-attested account of the mas- 
sacre of Armenian Christians by the Kurds in 1894 ; 
but the general question is clearly, though briefly, 
treated. The author lived several years in the re- 
gion of this massacre, and we cannot but accept his 
account as substantially accurate. There is no hope 
of reform from within, as he clearly shows ; yet he 
does not seem to appreciate the delicate balance of 
European powers that makes intervention difficult. 
That American public opinion can accomplish any- 
thing in the matter is not easy to see. 

" I am willing to make any part of my 
I*? Public, if it will help others," said 
Miss Lucy Larcom, in speaking of 
her intention to write a volume of reminiscences of 
her later years, as a continuation of " A New En- 
gland Girlhood." But she did not live to carry out 
her purposes. At her death, her papers fell into 
the hands of Mr. Daniel Dulaney Addison, and 
from them he has prepared a volume entitled the 
" Life, Letters, and Diary of Lucy Larcom" (Hough- 
ton), which is a successful attempt to carry on the 
life-story of this interesting woman and poet in the 
spirit that she would have wished ; that is, dealing 
chiefly with inner experiences, such as friendship, 
intellectual and religious experiences, undercur- 
rents of thought and feeling. Miss Larcom was 
forty-six years old when her first volume of verse 
was printed, called simply " Poems." It contained 
many of the lyrics upon which her fame as a poet 
will always be based ; such as " Hannah," " Skip- 
per Ben," " Hilary," " A Thanksgiving." The next 
sixteen years were ones of considerable productive- 
ness, and in 1884 the different volumes were bound 
together in a " Household Edition " of her works. 
Between Miss Larcom and J. G. Whittier there was 
a life-long friendship, and they published several 
works in collaboration. In later years she became 
acquainted with Phillips Brooks, who soon became 
the great religious guide of her life ; and under his 
influence she was finally led to changes of belief far 
removed from the rigorous Puritan theology in 
which she had been reared. In reading this simple 
record of a life passed amid seemingly monotonous 
surroundings, one realizes how often it may happen 
that mental vicissitudes are more dramatic and real 
than the outward events of even a varied life. 



Mr. Charles Carleton Coffin's " The 
Daughters of the Revolution" 
(Houghton) is a commendable at- 
tempt to vivify the precursory and the opening 
events of the Revolutionary War by weaving them 
into a romance. History forms the staple of the 
book, the imaginative part being merely sufficient 
to supply a connecting thread. As the title implies, 
the author's main design is to portray the hitherto 
somewhat neglected share in the Revolution of the 
wives and daughters of its heroes ; and by making 



his characters types and his dialogue largely dis- 
cussion of the questions of the day he has managed 
to insinuate a fair amount ef solid information. Sir. 
Coffin's descriptions of Lexington, Concord, Bunker 
Hill, and of the earlier affrays between the citizens 
and soldiery, the historic " Tea Party," the shoot- 
ing of the boy, Christopher Snider, etc., are lively 
and accurate ; and altogether his book is a very suc- 
cessful one of the kind an especially good one to 
be put in the hands of Young America. The illus- 
trations, consisting of portraits of Colonial and Rev- 
olutionary worthies, cuts of historic houses and 
places, etc., add decidedly to the interest and value 
of the volume. 

" If everybody likes it there must 
^SSSiuu. be . something wrong about it," said 

Bishop Griswold, of a sermon of his 
own. That is one objection to the " Reminiscences 
of Bishop Clark" (Whittaker). The interesting 
matter, the sparkling style, the graceful humor, the 
abounding anecdote, the frank and modest self- 
revelation, give Bishop Clark's book a special charm 
and insure it a universal welcome. And we must 
return to Bishop Griswold for the only other objec- 
tion : " I have never been sorry for the things I 
have not said." That is a sad instance of prelatical 
impenitence. There may have been abundant rea- 
son to be sorry. Silence is often as traitorous as 
any speech. At all events, others may reasonably 
be sorry, when the speaker or writer, secure in his 
reticence, is content. It is not often that what is 
omitted haunts us. But those who have had access 
to the stores of the Bishop's memory, and have 
heard him in his hours of ease pour them out in all 
their rich abundance, cannot but miss what has not 
been said, cannot but wish that he had let himself 
go more freely and given us two volumes instead of 
one. We are grateful, but unsatisfied. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Royal Natural History," to be published in 36 
fortnightly parts by Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co., 
has enlisted the distinguished services of Mr. Richard 
Lydekker for the editorial work, whereby the publica- 
tion will be approved to the judicious. The first instal- 
ment of this work, just issued, is an octavo pamphlet of 
96 pages, with two good colored plates and a large num- 
ber of woodcuts. The work thus inaugurated promises 
well and ought to prove popular. 

Some recent annotated English classics for school use 
are the following: Webster's first Bunker Hill oration 
and Burke's speech on Conciliation with America, both 
edited by Mr. A. J. George (Heath); the same speech 
of Burke, edited by Mr. L. D. Syle, Macaulay's essay on 
Johnson, edited by Mr. Gamaliel Bradford, Jr. (Leach, 
Shewell & Sanborn) ; and Scott's " Lady of the Lake," 
edited by Mr. Homer B. Sprague (Silver, Burdett & 
Co.). All are neat little books, painstaking in execution, 
and deserving the attention of teachers of English. 

Captain Marryatt's " Japhet in Search of a Father " 
and Michael Scott's " Tom Cringle's Log " are additions 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

to Messrs. Macmillan & Co.'s series of inexpensive re- 
prints of the popular fiction of a past generation. Mr. 
David Hannay writes the introduction to the former, 
giving a very readable account of Marryatt's life and 
work. Mr. Mowbray Morris seeks to perform the like 
office for Michael Scott, but there is little to say, for 
little is known. " Tom Cringle's Log " first appeared 
in " Maga," beginning in 1829. Its popularity sixty 
years ago certainly justifies this reprint, and a new cir- 
cle of readers is not likely to be lacking for it. 

The latest bound volume of the " Century " magazine, 
containing the numbers for the half-year ending with 
last April, has for its principal feature the opening chap- 
ters of Professor Sloane's " Life of Napoleon." Note- 
worthy among the remaining contents are the account 
of M. Tesla's electrical inventions, Mr. Maxim's de- 
scription of his flying-machine, Mr. Noah Brooke's per- 
sonal recollections of Lincoln, the beginning of Mr. 
Crawford's " Casa Braccio," and " A Walking Dele- 
gate," Mr. Kipling's first American story. 

A gift-book, seemingly intended for use as an Easter 
remembrance, comes to us from the Merriarn Co., and 
is entitled " Lingua Gemmse." It is " a history of one 
hundred precious stones with the signification and pop- 
ular superstitions attached to each and appropriate po- 
etic sentiments." The " sentiments " are from a great 
variety of sources, a passage from Milton serving to 
illustrate the anti-melancholic character of chalcedony, 
and Mr. Eugene Field's " Little Peach " being taken to 
go with nicolo (a kind of onyx), which is supposed to 
stand for youthful precocity ! 

" The Northern Library," which is a rival to the " Saga 
Library " of Messrs. Morris and Magnusson, makes a 
noble beginning with Mr. J. Sephton's translation of 
" The Saga of King Olaf Tryggwason." The transla- 
tion is simple and straightforward, without recourse to 
the archaisms of diction that flavor the versions by Mr. 
Morris, and has both introduction and index. The 
whole makes a beautifully printed volume of nearly five 
hundred pages, published in London by Mr. David 
Nutt, and in the United States by Messrs. Macmillan 
&Co. 

It seems to us a very remarkable fact that the great 
work of Herr Ferdinand Gregorovius, " Geschichte der 
Stadt Rom im Mittelatter," should have gone all these 
years without finding an English translator; but it is 
nevertheless true, and Miss Annie Hamilton's version, 
now in course of publication, is the first to be set before 
the English reader. This " History of the City of 
Rome in the Middle Ages " (Macmillan) follows the 
latest (fourth) edition of the original, and two thick 
volumes of five hundred pages each are now given us 
as a first instalment. An index is provided, although 
not a very extensive one. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Mr. Saintsbury is editing a new English translation 
of the novels of Balzac, the first volume of which will 
be issued at once. 

A new ten-cent monthly magazine, " The New Gal- 
axy," is to be published by Mr. Harry C. Jones, editor 
of " The Monthly Illustrator." 

The Christian Literature Co., of New York, has just 
published a lecture by Dr. Adolf Harnack on " Monas- 



ticism : Its Idols and Its History." The work is trans- 
lated by the Rev. Charles R. Gillett. 

The tenth annual meeting of the Western Association 
of Writers will be held at Eagle Lake, Warsaw, Indi- 
ana, from the 8th to the 12th of July. 

The late General M. M. Trumbull's papers on 
" Wheelbarrow and the Labor Question " are reprinted 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. as the latest num- 
ber of their " Religion of Science " library. 

The life of Sonya Kovalevsky is soon to be issued by 
the Century Co. It will include an autobiography cov- 
ering the girlhood of the celebrated mathematician, and 
a memoir by the late Duchess of Cajanello. 

A recent doctor's dissertation, presented to the Heid- 
elberg philosophical faculty by Mr. Robert Nelson Cor- 
win, has for its subject the " Entwickelung und Ver- 
gleichung der Erziehungslehren von John Locke und 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau." 

Two French professors of the College Chaptal re- 
cently discovered and bought at a public sale an authen- 
tic manuscript, hitherto unknown, of Charles Baude- 
laire. It is entitled " Les Mosurs et les Coutumes de la 
Belgique," and will be published at once. 

M. Charles Bourgeaud's " Etablissement t Revision 
des Constitutions en Amerique et en Europe," reviewed 
by us a year or two ago, has just been turned into En- 
glish by Professor Charles D. Hazen, the translation 
being published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

The Queen's birthday brought the honors of knight- 
hood to Mr. Henry Irving, Mr. Walter Besant, Mr. W. 
H. Russell (of Bull Run fame), and Mr. Lewis Morris. 
Why the latter should have received such a distinction 
is not easy to say ; can it be that the Queen and her ad- 
visers have taken him for a poet ? 

Two more " Trilbys " that is, two independently 
made translations of Nodier's conte, are among the re- 
cent books. One, published by Messrs. Estes & Lauriat, 
is the work of Mr. N. H. Dole; the other, with the im- 
print of Messrs. Lamson, Wolffe & Co., is put into En- 
glish by Miss Minna Caroline Smith. 

" Volpone," " Epiccene," and " The Alchemist " on 
the whole, Jonson's dramatic masterpieces have been 
reserved for the third and concluding volume of the 
plays of " rare old Ben," just added to the " Mermaid " 
series (imported by Scribner), and forming the twen- 
tieth volume of that useful collection. 

" Phallicism in Japan," a doctor's dissertation by 
Mr. Edmund Buckley of the University of Chicago, has 
been issued from the University Press. It makes a 
pamphlet of only thirty-four pages, but as the subject 
has hardly been touched upon before in the European 
languages, the amount of research represented is much 
more than is indicated by the dimensions of the mono- 
graph. 

Mr. Stedman has written the following ode for the 
Yale commencement exercises of this year: 

i. 

Hark ! through the archways old 
High voices manifold 
Sing praise to our fair Mother, praise to Yale ! 

The Muses' rustling garments trail ; 
White arms, with myrtle and with laurel wound, 

Bring crowns to her, the Crowned I 
Youngest, and blithest, and awaited long, 
The heavenly maid, sweet Music's child divine, 
With golden lyre and joy of choric song, 
Leads all the Sisters Nine.

Made her brave and strong, and her beauteous youth increased 

Till the winds of the West, from a wondrous land, 
From the strand of the setting sun to the sea of her sunrise

From fanes which her own dear hand hath planted in grove

Starward uplifts, afar its light to bear 
Thine own revere thee throned within thy porch, 

Rayed with thy shining hair.

The stateliest, statelier yet than prophet-bard hath sung. 
O mighty Mother, proudly set 

Beside the far inreaching sea, 
None shall the trophied Past forget 
Or doubt thy splendor yet to be !

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 1895. 



JUST A MOMENT! 

Are you a teacher in any of the departments of modern 
science ? We have the best and the fullest line of elementary 
text-books in that field published in this country. 

Kindly examine Chute's PHYSICS, Shepard's CHEMISTKIKS, 
Spaldinq't BOTANY, Cotton's ZOOLOGY, Bayer's BIOLOGY, 
OrndorjFs LABORATORY MANUAL IN ORGANIC CHKMISTKY, 
Benton's LABOKATOKY GUIDE, Whiting's PHYSICAL MEAS- 
UREMENTS, and Clarke' 1 s MICROSCOPY every one a labora- 
tory manual. The pupil, not the teacher, does the experi- 
mental and analytical work. They are just such books in 
science work as the Committee of Ten has recommended. 

In History, Civics, and Political Science we have also an 
interesting list. Beginning with Sheldon's GENKKAL HIS- 
TORY, the pupil obtains a clear idea of the development of 
monarchial forms. These books follow the laboratory plan. 

Thomas's HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES is the best type 
of a constitutional history for grammar schools ever published. 
It is a history of the people, showing the development of a 
strongly nationalized government. A manual of citizenship 
and a work of scholarship. 

Dole's AMERICAN CITIZEN is a proper sequel to Thomas's 
History of the United States. The whole aim and object of 
this book is the true object of education citizenship. For 
the higher studies in this line we have Wilson's THE STATE, 
a book that exhibits the actual organization and administra- 
tive practice of modern governments, and THE STATE AND 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, by the 
same author. Gide's THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECON- 
OMY is a guide book for students who are feeling their way 
beyond the elementary stage in political economy. In Wenzel's 
COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE 
DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT are paralleled the outlines 
of the four great constitutional governments of the world 
The United States, England, France, and Germany. For stu- 
dents of political economy, and for the law school, Lawrence's 
GUIDE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW is now in press. Still another 
professional work is THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES AT THE END OF THE FIRST CENTURY, by Ex-Senator 
Boutwell, of Massachusetts, a source of authority that cannot 
be questioned. 

Our list of Mathematical Text-books begins with the Kin- 
dergarten and ends with the University. At the foot of the lad- 
der there are a number of books and devices that cover every 
course in primary number work. Oral exercises and oral drills 
are the chief characteristics of Sultan's PUPILS' ARITHMETICS, 
a three-book series. Atwood's GRADED ARITHMETICS, a two- 
book series, is a very popular work with which to prepare for 
examinations. Walsh's ARITHMETIC in three parts is ar- 
ranged by grades and not by subjects. An important feature 
is the introduction of the elementary principles of algebra and 
geometry. Another is the introduction of about one thousand 
examination questions taken from various sources in actual 
business life among them, a long list of civil service exam- 
ination papers. Wjiite's Two YEARS WITH NUMBERS has 
become popular mainly on account of its simple language and 
practical examples. 

In Higher Mathematics, Bowser's ACADEMIC and Bowser's 
COLLEGE ALGEBRA are unsurpassed. Notice the treatment 
of Quadratics both by factoring and by the ordinary methods. 
Bowser's GEOMETRY is something more than an adaptation of 
the algebraic equation to geometric theorems. You will find a 
superb exposition of the Theory of Limits in this book. Mod- 
ern college work demands not a little analytical work in trig- 
onometry, and Bowser's TRIGONOMETRY is the most complete 
and the best arranged work of the kind published. The In- 
structor in Mathematics of Dwight Collegiate School, New 
York, says, " It is the only trigonometry I have yet seen that 
covers the ground required for the Yale examinations." 

Ten years ago, of the twenty-four books on our list, sixteen 
were German and French text-books. Now, our MODERN 
LANGUAGE list is a little more than ten times as great. Our 
Catalogue of Modern Language Publications contains the larg- 
est and most complete list of German, French, Spanish, Ital- 
ian, and Scandinavian texts published in America. They are 
used in not far from three thousand schools and colleges in 
the United States, Canada, England, Mexico, Central Amer- 
ica, and South America. The professors of modern languages 
in twenty-six colleges and universities have given these texts 
their unqualified approval.

A NEW NOVEL BY FRANK R. STOCKTON. 

The Adventures of Captain Horn. 

By FRANK R. STOCKTON. 12mo, $1.50. 
" The sustained power of this romance from the pen of a writer hitherto regarded chiefly as a humorist is 
remarkable. Mr. Stockton has certainly succeeded in his endeavor to write a serious novel of incident. He 
has not sunk his individuality in spinning this exciting yarn. There are many suggestions of his peculiar 
humor." New York Times. 
" It is unlike anything he has previously done, and we have no hesitation in pronouncing it his best work. 
It is in a new vein, and Mr. Stockton is master of it." Boston Advertiser.

Far East.

tribution to the study of contemporary life and politics in 
the East." London Times.

Impressions of America. By PAUL BOURGET. Trans- 
lated from the French. 12mo, $1.75. 
" A singularly interesting work in that it comes from a 
trained and practiced observer who sees and notes things 
which most of us merely glance at and straightway forget." 
The Nation. 
" Go with him through the United States and you will 
feel better acquainted with your own country. He is a close 
observer, a good worker, has great descriptive talent ; add 
to this a graceful style, a vein of wit, a sparkle of satire."-

TOUCHSTONES OF CRITICISM. 

We believe it was Emerson who once said 
that he was always glad to meet people who 
recognized the immeasurable superiority of 
Shakespeare over other poets. The feeling has 
doubtless been cherished by many a reader be- 
sides ; for, after all, what test of the sane out- 
look upon life, the deep sympathy with its man- 
ifold phases, the discriminative faculty that 
knows the ring of the precious metal from the 
base not in literature alone, could be equal to 
this ? To know the great poets, and to be sure 
that they are the great poets, not from mere 
passive acceptance of the traditional appraise- 
ment, but^ from reasoned and sincere convic- 



tion, this is one of the most desirable of pos- 
sessions ; for it betokens a well-ordered imag- 
ination, a just balance of the intellectual and 
emotional elements of the inner life, a capacity 
for the highest of all possible artistic satisfac- 
tions. A clever simulation of this attitude is 
sometimes encountered, but it cannot long de- 
ceive the elect. It is sure to unmask itself in 
relations of anything like intimacy, to fall back 
upon pilfered formulas obviously hollow as far 
as the one who flaunts them is concerned, to be 
caught napping when some peculiarly vital 
point is at issue, to betray by some trick of in- 
tonation, or gesture, or facial expression, the 
insincerity of the pretended appreciation. 

Yet even this pretence of comprehension is 
not always to be condemned. If it be made 
merely for the sake of conventionality, not 
much may be urged in its favor ; but if it re- 
sult from the humility of a judgment confident 
that the estimates reinforced by successive gen- 
erations must somehow be right, from the con- 
viction that failure to perceive all the beauty 
that a clearer vision has discerned must be at- 
tributable to one's own spiritual defect, and 
from the determination to assume the proper 
initial attitude and patiently wait for enlight- 
enment to come, then it is hardly chargeable 
with hypocrisy, and merits sympathy rather 
than disdain. In such a case, we aver, at least, 
the attitude in question is more becoming, to 
say nothing of its being more hopeful, than that 
of the out-and-out Philistine, who raises his stri- 
dent battle-cry to some such effect as this " I 
don't know anything about poetry, but I know 
what I like " and then proceeds to descant 
upon the beauties of, let us say, Sir Lewis 
Morris or Mr. James Whitcomb Riley. This 
sort of outburst is familiar enough to everyone 
who unwisely speaks of literature in the pres- 
ence of people who get their intellectual sus- 
tenance from the sensational periodical of 
monthly or daily publication, or from the pa- 
per-covered fiction of the newstand, and polite- 
ness usually forbids the only sort of reply that 
is adequate to the occasion. The advice needed 
by a person of this type is, in Mr. Frederic 
Harrison's phrase, that " he should fall on his 
knees and pray for a cleanlier and quieter 
spirit," but it must be left unspoken, and a 



336

smile of pity is the only permissible substitute. 

Undoubtedly the best general evidence that 
one is possessed of the cleanly and quiet spirit 
to which Mr. Harrison so feelingly alludes is 
afforded by a real pleasure in the accepted mas- 
terpieces of literary art, or at least in a consid- 
erable number of them. The reader whose joy 
in Shakespeare and Dante, in Virgil and Ten- 
nyson, in Homer and Shelley, in Goethe and 
Cervantes, is genuine and perennial, is entitled 
to feel some confidence in his judgment of the 
moderns, as yet unclassified and unranked ; to 
him, literature is no trackless forest, but a fa- 
miliar well-travelled highway, provided with 
sign-posts and landmarks. The great names 
of literature are touchstones which teach us 
unerringly to know the good from the meretri- 
cious, even among the slightest productions of 
the hour. For it is a mistake to assume that 
because the major poet is so immeasurably re- 
moved from the minor poet each must be judged 
by the standards of his own class. The hope- 
less confusion of perspective that results from 
this assumption is only too familiar to readers 
of current criticism. How often do we find 
some insignificant poetaster of the day charac- 
terized in terms that would give us pause were 
they applied to one of the master-singers of the 
world. How many " new poets " have been 
noisily heralded during the last twenty years, 
only to be consigned to forgetfulness a few 
months later. These critical extravagances are 
extremely unfortunate, for they bewilder the 
seeker after the beautiful, leading him into 
many a will-o'-the-wisp-haunted morass, besides 
tending to bring all criticism into disrepute. 
They are probably responsible in large measure 
for the amazing opinion, to which recent years 
have given considerable currency, that criticism 
has no business to be anything more than a sub- 
jective record of the critic's impressions, an un- 
reasoned enumeration of his likes and dislikes. 

But however prevalent such an opinion may 
become among the superficially-minded, gen- 
nine criticism, based upon the fundamental 
principles of art, is not likely to abdicate its 
function, any more than genuine economics is 
likely to abandon its scientific and rational pro- 
cedure because of the subjective semi-emotional 
discussion that now in so many quarters usurps 
its name. And whatever the special method 
that criticism may choose to pursue, it will 
never forget that literary art exists, that its 
fundamentals have the sanction of the centuries, 
that any marked departure from those funda- 
mentals is almost sure to be an indication of 



decadence or degeneracy, and that approved 
literature provides an almost infallible touch- 
stone by which to test the value of the litera- 
ture yet on trial. The best criticism is that 
which we get from those writers whose knowl- 
edge of the great poets is widest, and whose 
sense of their excellence is most unfailing. To 
narrow this suggested method from the general 
to the particular, we may say that Matthew 
Arnold's plan of keeping within memory's 
reach a few carefully-selected examples of fault- 
less diction, for purposes of comparison, is 
hardly to be improved upon. Arnold was en- 
tirely right in saying that to recognize the 
" grand style " by this sort of touchstone we do 
not need to be able to define it, and he might 
have added that no kind of a definition would 
help anyone to recognize it who, when brought 
into its presence, could remain unconscious 
thereof. What he says of the " grand style " is 
equally applicable to the other types of style 
which literature embodies. Symonds suggested 
a similar test of lyric excellence when he said 
that " a genuine liking for ' Prometheus Un- 
bound ' may be reckoned the touchstone of a 
man's capacity for understanding lyric poetry." 
And as Arnold tells us that the reader who 
does not intuitively recognize the " grand style" 
in Milton's " Standing on earth, not rapt above 
the pole," etc., can expect no other answer than 
"the Gospel words : Moriemini in peccatis 
vestris," so Symonds tells us that " if a critic 
is so dull as to ask what ' Light of Life ! thy 
lips enkindle' means, or to whom it is addressed, 
none can help him any more than one can help 
a man whose sense of hearing is too gross for 
the tenuity of a bat's cry." 

Perhaps a word may be said, in closing, of 
another sort of touchstone, one having no objec- 
tive value to speak of, yet subjectively of con- 
siderable interest to many of us. There are 
several pretty tales going about of life -long 
friendships formed and cemented by a common 
love for Fitzgerald's " Omar." Akin to these 
in their suggestion is the beautiful story of the 
Sicilians and their love for Euripides, the story 
which Browning has immortalized in the first 
adventure of Balaustion. Almost everyone who 
is widely read in literature takes to his heart 
of hearts some poet, as often as not of inferior 
rank, whose message is yet of such a nature as 
to make the strongest possible appeal to the 
individual idiosyncrasy. Such a poet becomes, 
to the one whose heart he has reached, a sort 
of touchstone to be applied to the rest of man- 
kind, a test of the sympathies that must under-

lie real intimacy. But it should not be for- 
gotten that this personal appeal to a few indi- 
viduals here and there does not warrant them 
in reckoning their poet among the great singers 
of the world. We should not confuse the sub- 
jective standards of criticism with the objective 
ones, strong as is the temptation so to do. 
Even the sanest and most experienced critics 
do not always escape this confusion. Victor 
Hugo, for example, means a great deal to Mr. 
Swinburne personally, and so Mr. Swinburne, 
presumably writing what he intends for objec- 
tive criticism, bestows deplorably extravagant 
praises upon the poet. On the other hand, 
Matthew Arnold, not liking some things about 
Shelley, is impelled to register the opinion that 
his prose is better than his poetry. It is hard 
to say which of these two vagaries is the more 
disheartening. If such men are capable of such 
lapses, what may we hope of lesser critics? 
One thing, at least, is clear. It cannot be as- 
serted too frequently or too insistently that the 
likes or the dislikes of a critic have nothing to 
do with criticism, if the term is to be taken 
intelligibly. The argument, " This work is 
good because I like it, and this other work is 
not good because I dislike it," is nothing more 
than childish dogmatism, and quickly leads to 
some such reductio ad dbsurdum as has been 
illustrated. In any objective sense, no merely 
personal preference, however strongly felt, is 
to be reckoned among the touchstones of gen- 
uine criticism. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

SHAKESPEARIAN PLAYS AT CHICAGO 

THEATRES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A remark made by Mr. T. R. Sullivan in " The At- 
lantic Monthly " for May, to the effect that Shake- 
speare's " Tempest " has not been played these forty 
years, brought to mind a performance of that supreme 
romantic achievement witnessed by me in Chicago six 
years ago. In the summer of 1889, the veteran actor 
and manager, Mr. J. H. McVicker, put upon the boards 
of his theatre a somewhat spectacular, but, on the whole, 
not inadequate version of " The Tempest "; and the suc- 
cess of the production is attested by the fact that it ran 
if I recollect aright nightly for several weeks. With 
this recollection it occurred to me that some people 
might possibly be interested to know what opportuni- 
ties have been offered an ardent Shakespearian, living 
in the great lakeside city, to witness stage performances 
of the Master during the past score of years. Through- 
out that period, I have never missed an opportunity to 
see a new play of Shakespeare; and I find, somewhat 
to my astonishment, that no less than twenty-five of the 
thirty-six plays included in the first and second folios 



have been produced at one or another of the Chicago 
theatres since 1875. Some of the performances have 
left much to be desired, have been anything but Shake- 
spearian in spirit, and have made all sorts of conces- 
sions to the vulgar taste of the groundlings; but from 
the poorest of them all I have got something that I 
could not get, probably because of defective powers of. 
imagination, from mere reading of the text. 

My first play was " Hamlet," Booth's " Hamlet," 
which at once became for me, and remained, the type, 
although I was afterwards forced to recognize a greater 
degree of subtlety and tender feeling in Mr. Irving's 
presentation of the Dane. McCullough's " Othello," 
likewise, first made me know and love the Moor, al- 
though a new revelation awaited me from Sig. Salvini. 
But nothing need here be said of these plays, or of 
" Romeo and Juliet," " The Merchant of Venice," " As 
You Like It," " Twelfth Night," " King Lear," Mac- 
beth," " Julius Csesar," " Much Ado about Nothing," 
or " Richard III." All eleven of these may be seen 
almost yearly, if one will, ia any of our larger cities. 
To Mr. Daly's admirable company I owe my first, and, 
indeed, my only acquaintance with " Love's Labour 
Lost" and "The Taming of the Shrew." Mme. Mod- 
jeska won my lasting gratitude by making me ac- 
quainted with " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " and 
" Measure for Measure." Most theatre-goers have seen 
Messrs. Robson and Crane in " The Comedy of Errors," 
and some in " The Merry Wives of Windsor." To the 
memory of Adelaide Neilson thanks are due for my 
first " Cymbeline," as well as for other gracious Shake- 
spearian gifts. Miss Mary Anderson's Hermione and 
Perdita in " The Winter's Tale " will always remain 
fragrant in the recollection. " Henry VIII." has been 
occasionally given, for the sake of Katharine, by Mme. 
Modjeska and others. " The Midsummer Night's 
Dream " was, like " The Tempest," produced by the 
enterprise of Mr. McVicker as a summer play. " Cor- 
iolanus " I have seen only once, but that once was in 
Sig. Salvini's superb portrayal. Once, likewise, have 
I seen " Richard II.," but I shall not easily forget the 
occasion, since the performance was interrupted by a 
half-demented wretch in the gallery, who fired three 
pistol-shots at Edwin Booth, rudely breaking in upon 
the fine soliloquy of the King in the fifth act. My 
twenty-fifth play, added to the list only a few weeks 
ago, was a spirited performance of " Henry IV.," Part 
1, the leading parts taken by Messrs. Warde and James. 

And now, looking over the names of the remaining 
plays, I fear that I must remain content with what I 
have seen. I still have some hopes of " Antony and 
Cleopatra " and of " Henry V." Recent news from 
London indicates that " All 's Well that Ends Well " 
may also be among the possibilities of the future, and the 
newspapers now report Mr. Mansfield as contemplating 
a production of "Timon of Athens." Even "John" is 
not absolutely outside the range of things that may 
happen. But with " Henry VI.," Parts 1, 2, and 3, 
with " Henry IV.," Part 2, and with " Titus Andron- 
icus," and " Troilus and Cressida," the case, I fear, is 
hopeless. Possible new sensations of the first rank are 
closely limited to four or five; I must henceforth be 
satisfied with those new sensations of the second rank 
that may come from more adequate presentations of the 
old plays than I have yet seen, or from more sympa- 
thetic delineations of the old characters than have yet 
been brought to my attention. <yy\ M. P.

BARRAS'S MEMOIRS.* 



Amid the general chorus of exaltation of 
the genius and works of the first Napoleon, the 
long awaited "Memoirs of Barras" sound a 
sharply discordant note. It is well known 
that the ex-Director and titular commandant 
of the 13th Vendemiaire came to cordially hate 
the man he had lifted from the squalid obscu- 
rity of his earlier life ; and if any further proof 
of the fact were needed it is to be found in 
abundance in these volumes. Barras died in 
1829. The last ten years of his life were spent 
mainly in preparing the materials for his Mem- 
oirs ; and these documents he bequeathed to 
his friend, M. Rousselin de Saint- Albin, as to 
a congenial spirit who could be trusted to carry 
out editorially, and even to further, his cherished 
design of dwarfing and blackening the fame 
of the Corsican upstart. By a strange irony of 
fate these venom-laden writings, after lying un- 
printed for near half a century (their successive 
custodians shirking the risk of launching such 
a " nestful of libel suits ")|, have fallen finally 
into the hands of an editor who is an ardent 
admirer of Napoleon, M. George Duruy, who 
now hands them over to the public, with any- 
thing but a benison on their author. Admit- 
ting rather grudgingly the general interest and 
rare piquancy of the Memoirs, M. Duruy an- 
grily brands Barras's account of Napoleon as 
largely a tissue of lies ; and it must be owned 
that the character of the Jacobinical Vicomte 
was not such as to inspire confidence in his 
veracity. Barras was corrupt, self-seeking, 
and vain. There are passages in his book 
which stamp him as that meanest of black- 
guards, the " lady-killer " who gratifies his van- 
ity or wreaks his spite by betraying the names 
of his victims. Politically, he was, as Taine 
says, a condottiere open to the highest bidder. 
Aristocrat by birth and sans-culotte by trade, 
he exploited the Revolution to his own profit ; 
and by adroitly trimming his sails at the right 
junctures he was borne prosperously on by 
storms which wrecked many a better and cleaner 
man. His real lack of political ideals is naively 
betrayed in the Memoirs. At the outset, for

umes, illustrated. Volumes I. and II. New York : Harper &

t Under the French law, action may be brought by descend- 
ants for libel on ancestors. 



instance, we find him covertly bragging of his 
pedigree : of his ancestral parchments ; of the 
Provencal proverb, JVobles comme les Barras, 
aussi anciens que nos rockers; while later on 
he is constantly flaunting his Jacobinism, his 
contempt of his caste, and proudly recording 
that, at the various sif tings and purgings of the 
Jacobin Club, no taint of incivism was ever 
found to attach to the name of citizen Barras. 
One may add here that it was the hand of cit- 
izen Barras that, after the 9th Thermidor, 
closed the doors of the Jacobins forever. 

Yet, as M. Duruy admits, Barras was not to- 
tally bad. That he had no small measure of both 
courage and capacity (the latter of a rather 
vulpine order, certainly) his own record, at- 
tested by history, shows. If he was a Terror- 
ist, he was not cruel ; if he guillotined his neigh- 
bor, it was to prevent that neighbor from guil- 
lotining him ; if he outranted in his levelling 
zeal the simon-pure sans-culottes of the gut- 
ters, it was to gloss over the perilous fact that 
he was himself a sans-culotte of the salons ; if 
he was a trimmer, he could strike, as his ene- 
mies learned on the 9th Thermidor, the 13th 
Vendemiaire, the 12th Germinal, etc., occa- 
sions on which he clearly regarded himself 
afterwards as the providential man. Profligate, 
venal, self-centred, a rancorous hater and a fair- 
weather friend, an aristocrat at heart and a 
demagogue by calling, a relentless shedder of 
blood on occasion, yet less cruel than even the 
best of his colleagues, such we believe to have 
been in the main this most refined, most epi- 
curean, most ancien regime of the Montagnards, 
and most wildly revolutionary among the nobles 
in the Convention. 

While the Memoirs (thus far, at least) can 
hardly be said to add much to our stock of 
serious historical knowledge, the chance anec- 
dotes and pen-pictures of famous people with 
which they abound are of rare freshness and 
piquancy. Most of them, even where the re- 
lator's malice peeps out, bear an unmistakable 
impress of truth. A notable sketch is that of 
Robespierre, to whom Barras, shortly after his 
" pacificatory " mission of fire and sword to the 
South of France, paid, with Frcron, a concil- 
iatory visit. Barras had been charged with 
thieving while on mission ; and hence had good 
reason to dread the encounter. The reception 
of the two deputies by the " incorruptible " one 
was alarming enough plainly a shadow of com- 
ing events. 

" Robespierre was standing, wrapped in a sort of chem- 
ise-peignoir; he had just left the hands of his hair-

dresser, who had finished combing and powdering his 
hair; he was without the spectacles he usually wore in 
public, and piercing through the powder covering that 
face, already so white in its natural pallor, we could see 
a pair of eyes whose dimness the glasses had until then 
screened from us. These eyes fastened themselves on 
us with a fixed stare expressive of astonishment at our 
appearance. We saluted him in the simple fashion of 
the period. He showed no recognition of our courtesy, 
going by turns to his toilette-glass hanging to a window 
looking out on a court-yard, and then to a little mirror, 
intended, doubtless, as an ornament to his mantel-piece; 
taking his toilette-knife, he began scraping off the pow- 
der, mindful of observing the outlines of his carefully 
dressed hair; then doffing his peignoir, he flung it on a 
chair close to us so as to soil our clothes, without apol- 
ogizing to us for his action, and without even appearing 
to notice our presence. He washed himself in a sort of 
basin which he held in one hand, cleaned his teeth, re- 
peatedly spat on the ground right at our feet, without 
so much as heeding us, and in almost as direct a fashion 
as Potemkin, who, it is known, did not take the trouble 
of turning the other way, but who, without warning or 
precaution, was wont to spit in the faces of those stand- 
ing before him. This ceremony over, Robespierre did 
not even then address a single word to us. ... I in- 
formed him politely that our visit to him was prompted 
by the esteem in which we held his political principles; 
he did not deign replying to me by a single word, nor 
did his face reveal the trace of any emotion whatever. 
I have never seen anything so impassible in the frigid 
marble of statuary or in the face of the dead. . . . Such 
was our interview with Robespierre. I cannot call it a 
conversation, for his lips never parted; tightly closed 
as they were, he pursed them tighter; from them, I no- 
ticed, oozed a bilious froth, boding no good. I had seen 
all I wanted, for I had had a view of what has been 
most accurately described as the tiger-cat." 

This meeting was, of course, the prelude to 
the death-struggle of the 9th Thermidor, of 
which and the swift denouement Barras gives a 
detailed and most dramatic description. After 
the parliamentary defeat of Robespierre on that 
day, his arrest, imprisonment, and rescue by 
the Commune, it was Barras who headed the 
troops of the Convention detailed to re- arrest 
him at the Hotel-de-Ville. The scene within 
was tragic enough. 

" Robespierre had shattered his jaw with one of the 
two pistols carried by Le Bas, who had blown his brains 
out with the other. Couthon was hiding under a table, 
and Robespierre in a little room, by the door of which 
Le Bas lay. Saint Just was ministering to Robespierre. 
Henriot was crouching in a closet. . . . One of the sur- 
geons having placed on a table the teeth which had fallen 
from Robespierre's mouth during his examination of it, 
a gunner who was on duty pounced on them, and, ad- 
dressing Robespierre, exclaimed, You scoundrel, I will 
keep them as a monument of execration ! ' " 

It was Barras who hurried the details of the 
execution of his fallen foes spurring on to 
his duty the, for once, reluctant and wavering 
Fouquier-Tinville ; it was Barras who insisted 
that the tumbrels should pass to the scaffold 



by the old route, past Robespierre's house, that 
Danton's dying prophecy might be fulfilled ; 
and it was he who gave to Sanson the grimly 
grotesque directions as to the burial. " Let 
the bodies," he said, " be thrown into the grave 
of the Capets ! Louis XVI. was better than 
they. It will be some more royalty for Robes- 
pierre, for it would seem that he too had a taste 
for it." From the windows of the Committee 
of Public Safety, Barras, breathing freer as the 
end approached, saw the carts containing the 
doomed men wend their way by the Rue Saint- 
Honore to the place of execution. 

" The immense throng obstructed the streets and was 
an obstacle to the rapid progress of the procession, but 
the prevailing feeling was not only one of unanimous 
rejoicing, but of deliverance, and yet this feeling did 
not venture to break out in words and escape from hearts 
so long oppressed until it had become a recorded fact 
that ' the head of Robespierre had really fallen on the 
Place de la Revolution.' The baskets of the executioner 
were then carried away to the cemetery of the Made- 
leine, and interred in the place designated as the tombe 
capetienne. . . . The terrible Robespierre was at last 
launched into the eternal night, and slept side by side 
with Louis X VI." 

The terrible Robespierre, yes ; but was he the 
mere monster of blood and crime that Barras 
depicts ? Or was he, rather, as some hold, the 
pure, if visionary, patriot bent on achieving 
his Utopia, on purging the new-born Republic 
of " that vermin which had fastened on its 
body "; of scoundrels like Tallien ; Fouche, 
" whose atrocious face was less so than his 
soul "; Carrier, " that bloodthirsty satrap "; 
Courtois, " thief and forger "; " the drunken 
Freron and his dissolute accomplice Barras," 
all of them men whose hands were, as Robes- 
pierre said, " full of plunder and blood " ? 
There are many, like M. Duruy and M. Ernest 
Hamel, who will see in the issue of the Ther- 
midorian struggle, not the overthrow of a tyrant, 
but the defeat of an honest zealot at the hands 
of the knaves he had determined to strike. The 
question is an open one. For our own part, 
we believe Robespierre to have been a danger- 
ous, if well-intentioned, fanatic, the purest type 
in history of his kind, who rose to the top by 
virtue of being the most fanatical man in France 
at a time when fanaticism was the order of the 
day. The far abler Saint-Just was his counter- 
part. In Danton, Barras rightly sees the real 
hero of the period " the most magnificent 
and grandest Revolutionist who ever breathed." 
Marat was, he says, Republican, " but with an 
ardor over-stepping the bounds of moderation 
the slightest color of a speech contrary to the 
principles of equality and liberty inspired him

with the most violent suspicions." That the 
" peoples' friend " could be easy with his foes 
the following incident shows. 

" The mob had seized upon a man wearing a black 
coat, with the powdered and curled hair of the old regime. 
' To the lamp-post with the aristocrat ! ' was being re- 
peated on all sides. He was about to be strung up 
when Marat, pushing his way through the crowd, said, 
" What is it you are going to do with so pitiful an aris- 
tocrat ? I know the fellow.' With that he seized the 
man, and, giving him a kick in the proper place, said, 
1 Take that ! There 's a lesson will teach you to behave 
better! ' The mob clapped its hands, and the aristocrat 
ran off as fast as his legs would carry him." 

Barras draws a striking portrait of Saint- 
Just, as he appeared in the tribune when read- 
ing the report that sent Danton to the scaffold. 

"Phlegmatic, and in his sententious tone, he recites 
this incredible theme, holding the manuscript in a hand 
that remains motionless, while the other makes but one 
gesture, inexorable and from which there is no appeal 
a gesture like unto the very knife of the guillotine." 

Barras's treatment of women in his Memoirs 
is mostly malicious, and sometimes infamous. 
As to Mme. de Stael, he declares (with his 
usual abominable innuendo) : 

" I never really knew to which sex she belonged. 
. . . The virility of her form, face, and carriage, her 
manner of wearing her clothes, the strength of her in- 
tellectual conceptions, her exuberant vigor and energy, 
all, in short, would have led me to believe that she 
belonged rather to our sex than the other, had she not 
given indubitable proofs of her own by several acts of 
maternity." 

Solely, as we believe, to strike at Napo- 
leon, it is upon the unhappy Josephine that 
our virtuoso of insult launches the full tide 
of his malice crushing, as it were, with his 
brutal fist the delicate petals of this frail and 
lovely tropical flower. It must be owned that 
Josephine's indiscretions gave matter enough 
for grievous discoveries. But Barras paints 
her as a mere vulgar Messalina a " lewd 
Creole" whose most catholic tastes knew no 
distinction of rank, of character, or even of 
color ; as the known mistress of himself, of 
Hoche, of Hoche's hostler ; as a sordid strum- 
pet who " would have drunk gold from the 
skull of her lover "; as an invalided coquette, 
precociously decrepit from her excesses, deriv- 
ing " none of her attractions from nature, but 
everything from art the most refined, the 
most provident, the most finished art ever called 
into requisition in the exercise of their profes- 
sion by the harlots of Greece and Rome." 
"Confessing" (with a fine, grand-gentleman 
show of " modesty ") his own liaison with Jose- 
phine, Barras avers, not only that Napoleon, 
when expectant bridegroom, was aware of it, 



but that he exploited it to push his own affairs, 
and to curry favor. " As he perpetually had 
something to ask of me," says Barras, " he 
thought to appear less of a petitioner by getting 
her to do the soliciting." One of these begging 
interviews, he continues, " lasted longer than 
suited me." 

"... Straining me to her bosom, she upbraided me 
for no longer loving her, again and again saying to me 
that I was the man whom she had loved more than any 
other, and that she could not tear herself away from me 
just as she was about to become the wife of the ' little 
general.' " 

Proceeding with his " confession," this chiv- 
alrous gentleman charges his petitioner with 
assuming toward him the role of Potiphar's 
wife, adding (rather unnecessarily), " I should, 
nevertheless, be lying did I pretend to have 
been so cruel as the young minister of Pha- 
raoh." We should have spared the reader these 
unsavory details, were they not essential to a 
proper estimate of the Memoirs and the mem- 
oirist.* 

The evidences of Barras's hatred of the Em- 
peror are freely sown throughout the volumes. 
He patronizes, sneers at, and reviles him by 
turns ; jeers at his poverty, his shabby clothes, 
his diminutive size (" puss-in-boots," is one of 
his nicknames), and affects to regard the " Na- 
poleon legend " as rooted in the silly cult of a 
few " grognards." He does not hesitate to 
liken him physically to the hideous Marat, and 
morally to the infamous Marquis de Sade, the 
list of whose bestialities a nicer historian would 
hesitate to touch with the tongs. Barras cer- 
tainly played a brilliant and honorable part at the 
siege of Toulon and on the 13th Vendemiaire ; 
and he is at great pains to belittle Napoleon's 
role on both these occasions. At Toulon this 
role is summed up in three blunders ; while on 
the 13th Vendemiaire, Barras repeatedly as- 
serts, " Bonaparte was neither more nor less 
than my aide-de-camp." Very malicious, very 
racy, and doubtless largely true, is our Ther- 
sites's account of the Bonaparte family shady 
adventurers of the " dead-beat " order, driven 
out of Corsica, and lighting first on Antibes, 
where they lived on money begged, borrowed, 
or stolen, and barely sufficient " to provide them 
with a mattress which they shared in common, 
and a cauldron wherein to boil vegetables, and 
out of which they all ate together." Strange 
indeed seem to have been the shifts to which 

* Some notion of Barras's repute with his contemporaries 
may be formed from the fact that there was issued in his life- 
time a three-volume work entitled " Amours du Vicomte de 
Barras.'" Barras rather boasts of it.

these Corsican shorn lambs by choice resorted : 
to posing as refugees ; to begging military ra- 
tions, on the plea of a relative in the artillery ; 
in short, to trading on everything dishonora- 
bly trafficable even on "the budding allure- 
ments of the young ladies." We are far from 
meaning to imply an opinion that Barras's nar- 
rative is mainly false, and therefore valueless 
as serious history. We repeat that much of it 
bears the unmistakable impress of truth. It is 
the personal side of the Memoirs, the anecdotes, 
bits of <7e?we-paintmg and portraiture, that lend 
them their peculiar interest, and explain the 
sensation they have excited in France and the 
impatience with which the closing volumes are 
awaited. The work is handsomely mounted, 
and the portraits, though few, are from rare 
originals and of singular interest. E G j 



ENGLISH SEAMEN IN THE SIXTEENTH 
CENTURY.* 

In his address on " The Science of History," 
delivered in 1864, Mr. Froude demanded of 
history that it match itself with the drama : 

" There are periods the history of which may be so 
written that the actors shall reveal their characters in 
their own words; where mind can be seen matched 
against mind, and the great passions of the epoch not 
simply be described as existing, but be exhibited at their 
white heat in the souls and hearts possessed by them." 

In this latest, posthumous volume, the pro- 
gramme laid down thirty years before is real- 
ized. The nine lectures of which the book is 
made up contain the exposition, the develop- 
ment, and the catastrophe of one of the most 
picturesque episodes in English history the 
defeat of the Spanish Armada ; and the his- 
torian's method is, as he has proposed, in large 
measure to let the actors reveal their characters 
in their own words. Thus, we meet hitherto 
unpublished letters and memoirs from Father 
Parsons, the Jesuit general in England, from 
Sir John Hawkins, Sir Francis Drake, Medina 
Sidonia, and others. These are the chief actors. 
Mr. Froude's style in these lectures well merits 
the attributive " dramatic." It is more nervous, 
more direct, more personal, than ever before. 
True, we are tolerably well acquainted with 
this epoch. Mr. Froude himself has treated it 
twice, in his " History of England " and in 
" The Spanish Story of the Armada." Thus 
we are well prepared for a drama. But Mr.

tures delivered at Oxford, Easter Terms, 1893-94. By James 
Anthony Froude. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



Froude has also gone beyond the programme of 
the lecture quoted, and endeavored to introduce 
something of that science which he there denies 
to History. These lectures attempt to explain 
the English Navy. And the attempt seems 
plausibly successful. The explanation is, in 
brief, that the English Navy, which defeated 
the Armada and established the imperishable 
renown of English seamen, grew out of piracy 
encouraged by self-preservation and revenge 
for religious persecutions. To quote the lec- 
turer's own words : 

" The English sea-power was the legitimate child of 
the Reformation. Matthew Parker and Bishop Jewel, 
the judicious Hooker himself, excellent men as they 
were, would have written and preached to small pur- 
pose without Sir Francis Drake's cannon to play an ac- 
companiment to their teaching " (p. 3) . . . . " The Pro- 
testants revenged their injuries [at the hands of the 
Inquisition] at their own risk and in their own way, and 
thus from Edward VI.'s time to the end of the century 
privateering came to be the special occupation of ad- 
venturous, honorable gentlemen, who could serve God, 
their country, and themselves, in fighting Catholics " 
(p. 18). . . . "It was a wild business : enterprise and 
buccaneering sanctified by religion and hatred of cruelty ; 
but it was a school for the building of vessels which 
could outsail all others on the sea " (p. 21). 

One tone which Mr. Froude struck in the 
overture of 1864 has almost died out of this 
opera of 1894. History is 

" A voice forever sounding across the centuries the laws 
of right and wrong. Opinions alter, manners change, 
creeds rise and fall, but the moral law is written on the 
tablets of eternity. For every false word or unright- 
eous deed, for cruelty and oppression, for lust and van- 
ity, the price has to be paid at last." 

There we hear the disciple of Carlisle. But 
the following sounds like Beaconsfield. Speak- 
ing of Drake's splendid piracies on his trip 
round the world, he says : 

" In that intensely serious century, men were more 
occupied with the realities than the forms of things. 
. . . The King of Spain had given Elizabeth a hundred 
occasions for declaring war against him. Situated as 
she was, she could not begin a war on such a quarrel. 
She had to use such resources as she had, and of these 
resources the best was a splendid race of men who were 
not afraid to do for her at their own risk what commis- 
sioned officers would and might have justly done had 
formal war been declared. . . . No doubt by the letter 
of the law of nations Drake and Hawkins were corsairs. 
But the common sense of Europe saw through the form 
to the substance which lay below it, and the instinct of 
their countrymen gave them a place among the fight- 
ing heroes of England " (p. 103). 

Quite different is the situation when Fitzwil- 
liam uses detective arts to discover the Eidolfi 
plot against Elizabeth's life : 

" Very treacherous, think some good people. Well, 
there are times when one admires even treachery " 
(P- 67).

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



What a lamentable subtilizing in language is 
this ! The Froude of 1864 would at least have 
examined the premises more carefully before 
allowing himself to pronounce such a conclu- 
sion. 

Anent Sir John Hawkins's participation in 
the slave-trade, after depicting the usual fate 
of captives in war, Mr. Froude says : 

" Las Casas and those who thought as he did are not 
to be charged with infamous inhumanity if they pro- 
posed to buy those poor creatures from their captors, 
save them from Mumbo Jumbo, and carry them to coun- 
tries where they would be valuable property, and be at 
least as well cared for as the mules and horses. . . . 
It was an experiment. The full consequences could not 
be foreseen, and I cannot see that as an experiment it 
merits the censure which in its later developments it 
eventually came to deserve" (p. 38). 

This is not so surprising from the Englishman 
who in 1864 thought that "Washington might 
have hesitated to draw the sword against En- 
gland could he have seen the country which he 
made as we see it now." 

Mr. Froude finds the earliest use of the term 
" Puritan "in the memorial of Father Parsons 
already referred to, date 1585. Another inter- 
esting item is this : 

" In the Portsmouth fleet lay undeveloped the genius 
of the future naval greatness of England. . . . The 
watchword on board was ' God save the King ' ; the an- 
swer was, 'Long to reign over us': the earliest germ 
discoverable of the English National Anthem " (p. 14). 

It is a curious circumstance that a professor 
at Oxford could say to his audience : " Very 
few of you probably know more of Lope de 
Vega than his name" (p. 75). 

The strong individuality of the writer per- 
vades these lectures. We get almost as near 
to him as though we were in his presence. 

" An Oxford Church of England education is an ex- 
cellent thing, and beautiful characters have been formed 
in the Catholic universities abroad ; but as the elements 
of dynamite are innocent in themselves, yet when fused 
[sic ?] together produce effects no one would have 
dreamed of, so Oxford and Rome, when they have run 
together have always generated a somewhat furious 
compound" (p. 108). 

Mr. Froude makes, as it were, death-bed con- 
fession to the rule of force, in these words : 

" I have often asked my Radical friends what is to 
be done if out of every hundred enlightened voters two- 
thirds will give their votes one way, but are afraid to 
fight, and the remaining third will not only vote but 
will fight too if the poll goes against them. Which has 
the right to rule ? I can tell them which will rule. 
The brave and resolute minority will rule. . . . The 
majority must be prepared to assert their Divine Right 
with their hands, or it will go the way that other Divine 
Rights have gone before. ... I will not believe the 
world to have been so ill constructed that there are 



rights which cannot be enforced. It appears to me that 
the true right to rule in any nation lies with those who 
are best and bravest, whether their numbers are large 
or small " (p. 148). 

If Mr. Froude were only here to answer, one 
would like to ask him whether, then, the ele- 
phant should rule his keeper ; by what law the 
officers rule their men, the general his army, 
the gentle queen her navy ; whether best al- 
ways means strongest with their hands. But 
it would not be quite fair now.

DISCUSSIONS OF LABOR PROBLEMS.* 



Decidedly the best history of trade unions that 
has appeared in any country is that by Mr. and 
Mrs. Sidney Webb, the latter already favorably 
known in economic literature as Miss Beatrice Pot- 
ter, author of " The Cooperative Movement in Great 
Britain." The only work likely to remain in the 
field as supplementary, to a large degree, of this 
new volume is " Social Peace," by Schulze-Gaever- 
nitz. Many readers, knowing the prominent part 
taken by Mr. and Mrs. Webb in the propagandism 
of Socialism of a peaceful evolutionary type, will be 
surprised to discover how unbiased is the present 
treatment. The study of a movement which, in one 
century, has grown in Great Britain to include over 
one and a half million members, constituting in many 
trades nearly every skilled worker, deserves all the 
attention bestowed upon it. This movement, in its 
comparative freedom from the violence and cor- 
ruption that weakens some American unions, is a 
lesson to our own organizations. Yet the curious 
conservatism and trade selfishness still existing in 
the English unions form a great barrier to rapid 
progress there. The demand for the state manage- 
ment of industry is becoming more and more gen- 
eral among English workingmen ; but success in 
actual achievement will evidently be slow so long 
as the English wage-workers retain the quality often 
mentioned by our authors, a refusal to remove 
incompetent officers, due " partly to a generous ob- 
jection to ' do a man out of his job,' and partly to a 
deep-rooted belief that any given piece of work can 
be done as well by one man as another."

We can commend with equal heartiness the work 
on cooperative manufacturing in Great Britain, by 
Mr. Benjamin Jones. While the general reader, 
and even the specialist, will desire little more than 
to glance hastily over the mass of detailed history 
here presented, every student of cooperation will be 
greatly interested in the conclusions of this life-long 
leader of the movement. The standpoint is almost 
precisely that of the more brilliant and less detailed 
work of Miss Beatrice Potter (now Mrs. Webb) 
on " The Cooperative Movement in Great Britain." 
After many decades of failure to establish factories 
wherein the workers should own most of the cap- 
ital, elect some of their number as managers, suc- 
cess is beginning to dawn upon an altogether differ- 
ent type of productive cooperation the " federalist " 
method. In this, the capital and managing ability 
are furnished by the wholesale societies or groups 
of stores, in other words, by federations of con- 
sumers, who take charge of manufacturing the goods 
they need. One-seventh of all the population of 
England and Scotland are entering upon this work. 
If the other six-sevenths, or even most of them, 
should join the movement, there would be social 
ownership and management of factories and work- 
shops, at least. Profit-sharing is carefully consid- 
ered in this work, but receives only condemnation ; 
though it is not easy to see how anything urged by 
Mr. Jones militates against a truly honest profit- 
sharing plan. In its wide range of facts and careful 
deductions, Mr. Jones's work deserves to rank as 
the most exhaustive, as it is the freshest, book on 
the subject. It can hardly be called the most read- 
able, although it would be difficult to present such 
an array of facts in better shape ; and the many 
conclusions drawn are sure to interest all. 

" The Evolution of Modern Capitalism," by Mr. 
John A. Hobson, author of " Problems of Poverty," 
is the keenest discussion of the effects of machinery 
upon labor, industrial depressions, women's work, 
wages, and the evolution of the trust, that we have 
read for a long time. Starting out with a descrip- 
tion of the industrial revolution, and the irresistible 
tendency of the present age toward the formation 
of monopolies of large capital as well as the monop- 
olies of situation, Mr. Hobson holds that industrial 
depressions are caused by an undue proportion of 
the wealth of society going into capital goods ; that 
is, people, or society as a whole, save too much and 
consume too little of the products of machinery, and 
devote this saving to forms of machinery which are 
not properly adjusted to the needs of society. The 
chapter on the economy of high wages is the best 
word that has appeared upon the subject ; taking 
neither the exaggerated stand of Schoenhof, nor the 
too optimistic view of Rae and Brentano, that the 
higher the wages per day the greater the efficiency 
comparatively, or that the less the hours the greater 
the day's work. Nevertheless, the author shows how 
the balance of advantage, from a social standpoint, 
lies in shorter hours and an increase in the rational 



consumptive capacity of the masses. He looks for- 
ward to a very gradual assumption by society of all 
monopolistic and machine production, leaving to the 
individual initiative personal and professional serv- 
ice and handicrafts. He seems to us mistaken in 
holding that the growth of population, with a con- 
stantly rising standard of material consumption, is 
likely to prevent any diminution in the proportion 
of labor engaged on the soil ; rather, the contrary 
appears to be probable, because as the world grows 
wealthier the demand increases for finer and finer 
finishing of goods rather than an increase propor- 
tionately in the quantity of raw material in their 
texture ; while in the second place, the tendency of 
machinery is to relieve men of the necessity of spend- 
ing so large a part of his time in gathering the raw 
material. Hence, the growth of city life relatively 
to the country, despite its many evil sides, is an inev- 
itable outcome of growing wealth and the power of 
man over nature. Though many will disagree with 
parts of Mr. Hobson's analysis, no one interested 
in the problems he treats can afford to overlook his 
concise and readable discussion. 

Mr. John Rae, in his volume entitled " Eight 
Hours for Work," reprints his articles of the last 
two or three years on the subject from the " Con- 
temporary Review " and the " Economic Journal," 
with much new matter added. Mr. Rae is an en- 
thusiastic believer in the increased productiveness 
which comes from the eight-hour day, and gives 
very strong evidence from the history of Australia 
and the last fifty years in England to show that a 
reduction in hours does not, as many working-men 
hold, increase the opportunities for employment. 
Mr. Rae holds, with Professor Marshall and other 
economists, that it is an " economic fallacy which 
leads so many persons to think that they will all 
increase the wealth they individually enjoy by the 
diminishing of wealth they individually produce, and 
look for a great absorption of the unemployed to 
flow from a general restriction of production, the 
very thing which in reality would have the opposite 
effect of reducing the demand for labor and throw- 
ing multitudes out of employment." This view 
is not entirely conclusive, because perfect mobility 
of labor and capital do not prevail so as to allow 
the logic of competiton to work itself out fully. Mr. 
Rae shows that the business interests need not fear 
a shortening of the hours of work, and favors trade- 
union and state activity for securing these hours. 

Professor Brentano, in his small but well-written 
book on " Hours, Wages, and Production," shows 
how in times past the increase of wages, shortening 
of hours, and easier conditions of employment, did 
not necessarily increase the energy of labor, because 
the wage-worker had then a stationary standard of 
living, and when he could satisfy this with fewer 
days a week or fewer hours a day he worked less ; 
but now, thanks to public education, migration, and 
other factors which have increased the wants and 
aroused the ambition, increased wages and shorter

hours seem to be accompanied with increased effi- 
ciency of labor. In this book, the author, famous 
already for his classical but perhaps exaggerated 
arguments for trade unionism, has rendered another 
service to the cause of labor.

A DICTIONARY OF NAMES.* 



The " Century Cyclopedia of Names " is well 
conceived. To throw under one alphabet succinct 
descriptions of every interesting thing that has a 
proper name and of every person of general note 
or reputation, - to make a dictionary of names as 
an appendix to a dictionary of words, and to make 
it a separate volume, this is a highly commenda- 
ble undertaking. Its projector and successful ex- 
ecutor might fairly be called a public benefactor. 
The idea has the simplicity which is apt to charac- 
terize discoveries and reforms, and we should be 
grateful to editor and publishers for the faith and 
foresight shown in risking so much upon an enter- 
prise so bold and so original. Considering the rapid 
widening of human interests nowadays, and of the 
fund of human knowledge, considering, too, the 
great number of distinguished people of the pres- 
ent time who are excluded from consideration here, 
one is inclined to think that the final form of 
the work will have to be two volumes of this size, 
instead of one. More than two would be inconven- 
ient as well as costly. Meanwhile, it is only fair 
to judge the present work for what it is, and to 
make due allowance for the limitations imposed by 
the plan. 

The book is printed and bound in the magnificent 
style and form of " The Century Dictionary," to 
which it forms in reality a seventh and concluding 
volume. I have no hesitation in advising every pos- 
sessor of " The Century Dictionary " to place this 
volume on the same shelf, he will take it down 
oftener than the other six. And, although he must 
be prepared for frequent disappointment, and should 
not stake his reputation (if that be dear to him) 
upon the accuracy of the information here given, 
he will often consult the book to good purpose ; for 
it does, undeniably, contain an enormous fund of 
exact information. 

Having said so much in perfect good faith, I now 
proceed to give some of the results of a critical ex- 
amination to which, with the kind assistance of one or 
two of my colleagues, I have subjected certain de- 
partments of the work. Such an examination must 
necessarily be in large part microscopic, inasmuch 
as a book of this kind is, in the last analysis, noth- 
ing but a vast accumulation of minute details, the

value of which depends upon their absolute accu- 
racy. Much depends, to be sure, upon the manner 
in which the details are grouped and presented ; and 
of this editorial portion of the work I have some- 
thing to say. Inasmuch as I have been compelled 
to draw certain conclusions which it is an unpleas- 
ant duty to state, and which it may not be pleasant 
for the editor and some of his staff of " Eminent 
Specialists " to hear stated, I shall endeavor to array 
my examples in such a way that they may speak 
louder than any damaging inferences I may draw 
from them. Nevertheless, my share of these col- 
umns being limited, I am obliged at every point to 
select but a few out of the many examples I have 
accumulated. I have been forced to the conclusion 
that the work of preparing this dictionary has been 
" rushed " unduly ; that many parts of it have been 
superficially or carelessly done ; that the editor has 
shown himself lacking in the scholarly sense of the 
values and relations of things, which the presiding 
genius of such a work should possess ; and that in 
consequence the book is deficient in proportion. 

The following sentences from the Preface may 
suffice to indicate the origin, purpose, and plan of 
this book : 

" This Cyclopedia of Names is an outgrowth of The 
Century Dictionary. . . . The range of names to be in- 
cluded was practically unrestricted, since the object 
sought was ... a general account of all the names ex- 
cluded, by their nature, from the larger work. . . . 
The only condition of insertion has been that the name 
should be one about which information would be likely 
to be sought. . . . The space given to persons and 
places is relatively much greater than that devoted to 
any other class, and the others follow in what appeared 
to be the order of their usefulness to the general reader, 
whose needs have everywhere been considered in the 
selection of the names to be defined." 

Among the eminent men of the present time of 
whom no mention is made are the following : 

Fe'lix Faure, the new President of France, Brisson, 
the leading candidate in opposition, and Dupuy, the ex- 
premier; Dr. Parkhurst, now one of the most celebrated 
of living Americans; Li Hung Chang, who impressed 
General Grant as one of the greatest of men; Karl 
Hillebrand, perhaps the most cosmopolitan and original 
of German essayists; Maurice Maeterlinck, "the Bel- 
gian Shakespeare " (absurdly so styled) ; Casimir Pe'rier 
(1811-1876), the more distinguished father of the 
French ex-President; the late Sir John Thompson, Pre- 
mier of Canada, and the Hon. Mackenzie Bowell, his 
successor; Fukuzawa, the " great commoner " of Japan, 
and the Field Marshal, Count Oyama; Madame Sophie 
Kovalevski, the mathematician; Alexander Kielland, the 
Norwegian novelist; Carducci, the Italian poet, Far- 
ina and d'Annunzio, the Italian novelists; Friedrich 
Nietzsche, the philosopher of individualism; Professor 
Weismann, from whose name an international word has 
been coined; He're'dia, the French poet recently elected 
to the Academy; the leading modern political econo- 
mists, Alfred Marshall, Bastable, aid Bohm-Bawerk. 
This list might be greatly extended without the in- 
troduction of a single name not conforming to the ed- 
itor's one condition of insertion, that it be " one about 
which information would be likely to be sought." But

this list of omitted names, all but one or two of which 
are famous, and some positively illustrious, is in itself 
sufficient to prove that one cannot be at all confident of 
finding the name of a famous contemporary in this dic- 
tionary. On the other hand, many names, far from 
famous, are recorded, about whom, for some reason not 
stated, the editor imagines that information " would be 
likely to be sought." 

I have taken pains to record in my copy the dates of 
the deaths of notable people that have occurred since 
this cycloptedia of names went to press. The Preface 
bears date of September 1, 1894, by which time, I pre- 
sume, the printing was completed. The latest death 
that I find recorded here is that of James Strong (Au- 
gust 7, 1894). The deaths of Dr. Richard Morris and 
Prof. Henry Morley, which occurred last May, are also 
recorded. The following are among those of whose 
lives there is some record here, but whose deaths have 
been too recent to admit of mention: Prof. John Nichol, 
Rev. David Swing, Gen. N. P. Banks, Launt Thomp- 
son, G. B. de Rossi, Celia Tbaxter. Concerning the fol- 
lowing equally notable people, recently deceased, this 
dictionary is silent: Mrs. Augusta Webster, F. H. Un- 
derwood, Samuel J. Kirkwood, John Veitch, James 
Darmesteter. Mine. Fursch-Madi. It would be inter- 
esting to know why the editor supposed G. B. de Rossi 
a name concerning which information would be likely 
to be looked for, and James Darmesteter not; why he 
excluded Fursch-Madi and admitted Rosina Yokes ! 
If George Riddle, the elocutionist, receives notice be- 
cause he is an American, why should no mention be made 
of the far more celebrated Hutchinson family of singers ? 

Among American authors of more or less recent note, 
we find recorded the names and achievements of C. W. 
Balestier, J. B. McMaster, W. H. Gilder, R. E. Thomp- 
son, and Schele De Vere; while among those about 
whom the editor has supposed that information would 
not be likely to be sought are Emma Lazarus, Edith 
Thomas, Agnes Repplier, Professor Woodberry, Bran- 
der Matthews, and John Muir. The first and last in 
this list of omitted names have been held by many, from 
Emerson down, to be among the more interesting fig- 
ures in American literature. 

In the field of recent British literature a similar lack 
of any definite system of selection is to be detected. 
Edmund Gosse, Hall Caine, Kipling, W. E. Henley, 
William Watson, James Thomson (1834-1882), are 
duly included; but why are Theodore Watts, Churton 
Collins, Conan Doyle, Rider Haggard, Dean Hole, and 
Roden Noel left out ? If " information would be likely 
to be sought " concerning Edmund Gosse, might not that 
search haply lead straight to his castigator, Churton 
Collins ? And why should " the general reader " be 
supposed to crave more information about Dr. Morris 
and Professors Morley and Nichol ( " all honorable 
men ") than about a really first-rate man like Theodore 
Watts ? 

Much the same inconsistencies are to be found where- 
ever I have chanced to look. Of our " great editors," 
we find mention of Stead, Reid, Watterson, Dana, J. 
G. Bennett, G. A. Townsend, Parke Godwin, and Charles 
Emory Smith; but we look in vain for the names of 
E. L. Godkin and Horace White. Passing by an easy 
transition from editors to horses, we find, in the inter- 
esting biography of Palo Alto, the statement that his 
record was lowered by Stamboul, a fact which seems to 
entitle the latter to a notice, which, however, is not to 
be found. Palo Alto, by a natural if somewhat gro- 



tesque association, suggests President Jordan of Stan- 
ford University, who is duly noticed, although Presi- 
dents Harper and Stanley Hall, and Director Holden 
(of the Lick Observatory), are passed over. Among 
American astronomers Holden is not the only one for- 
gotten: Boss, Burnham, Chandler, Hall, and still others, 
are plunged in the " sleepy drench." Barnard, Gould, 
Newcomb, and others, are mentioned. Of the smaller 
colleges, some, as Beloit and Emory, find separate men- 
tion ; others of equal importance, as Wabash and Knox, 
are omitted. 

Among German professors, Professor Wiilker of 
Leipzig is noticed, while Professor Rudolph Hildebrand, 
a more eminent colleague recently deceased, is forgot- 
ten. At Berlin, Professor Lazarus is taken and Pro- 
fessor Paulsen is left. Of famous actors of present or 
recent time at the The'atre Franc.ais, the editor notices 
Got, Coquelin (pere, cadet, and^/z/s), Mounet-Sully, Fa- 
vart, Brohan, Samary, and others, while omitting the 
names of such equally eminent artists as Delaunay, 
Worms, Febvre, Blanche - Baretta, Broisat, Reichem- 
berg. Certainly the least of these last is an artist be- 
side whom Coquelin fils must take a very modest place. 

The treatment of the subject of pronunciation is often 
inadequate. Oftentimes the pronunciation of a name 
about which there can be no possible mistake is duly 
recorded: e. g., Black, White, Brown, Gray, Green. No 
foreigner sufficiently acquainted with English to under- 
stand the key to the pronunciation and the system of 
notation would need to be told how to pronounce such 
words. Many longer and less familiar names are left 
unpronounced : e. g., Wilibald, Willard, Wollstonecraft. 
In one column the pronunciation of the name Bee is 
duly given, while that of Beefsteak Club is not given. 
Hundreds of similar discrepancies might be cited. 
Again, when definite information is needed the name is 
in many cases left unpronounced: e. g., Daircell, Dakiki, 
Flore et Blanchefleur, Hissarlik, Malevole, Muspilli, 
Romualdo, Strachey, Wilkinasaga. 

Sometimes the information given is of no value, as 
when the two possible pronunciations of the family name 
of John Addington Symonds are both given, the one 
which this Mr. Symonds did not use being placed first; 
sometimes the marking is positively wrong: e. g., As- 
sornmoir, Murger, Rouher, the final r being incorrectly 
marked as silent. When a name is repeated, the pro- 
nunciation is generally figured under the first entry and 
omitted under the rest: e. g,, Wright (eight entries), 
but in the cases of some familiar names the marking is 
repeated: e. g., Mure, Whitney (six entries, the pronun- 
ciation marked under the first two), Wilkinson (four 
entries, the pronunciation marked under the first and 
last). 

The cross-references seem to have been very care- 
lessly edited. S. v. " Castle Rackrent," the reader is 
invited to " See Rackrent," which is invisible; s. v. " Gar- 
ter," the only remark is " See Garter "; s. v. " Lammer- 
muir," no reference is made to Scott's romance ; s. v. 
" Vicar of Wakefield," a wrong date of publication is 
given, the correct date being given s. v. " Goldsmith "; 
and a like error in the case of the " Nouvelle He"loi'se " 
may be corrected by reference to the article " Rous- 
seau." If the impatient reader desires information 
about the Grand Lama, he will look, if he has learned 
something of the habits of this book, under " Grand." 
No entry: turn to "Lama." Under this word stands 
the sole and mysterious legend, " See Suahili " under 
this, " See Swahili "; under this, " See Kisuahili "; this,

when found, is kaleidoscoped into Kiswahili, who, or 
which, with "damnable iteration," invites you to "See 
Suahili"- if you live to reach her, he will have a fa- 
miliar look, but it will persist in his admonition to 
" See " someone else. I have myself seen them all fre- 
quently without yet being the wiser, and am beginning 
to suspect that they are creatures of the imagination of 
one of the " eminent specialists." 

An even more unaccountable circumstance is that of 
the omission of any notice of the famous Comstock Lode, 
which has yielded more than $325,000,000; in the ar- 
ticles " Sutro " and " Virginia City " it is barely men- 
tioned. Of miscellaneous errors I note the following: 

S. v. " Howells," " The Lady of the Aroostook " is 
wrongly dated; s. v. "Faust," for Auster read Anster; 
Murger is germanized into Miirger; s. v. " Smart, Chris- 
topher," for " A Song of David " read " A Song to 
David"; for "Grimm, Hermann," read "Grimm, Her- 
man "; s. v. " Lessing," for Goerze (thrice) read Goeze. 
S. v. " Assommoir," the word is explained as meaning 
"bludgeon"; some clue to the subject would have been 
given by the statement that, as used by Zola, the word 
means " a low drinking-place." The editor is sure that 
the word " Fdlibres " is derived from a Provencal word 
felibriges. What " eminent specialist " told him that ? 
Mistral first heard the word from an old woman who 
did not know what it meant; Mistral does not know, 
and nobody has ever found out. So at least says Gas- 
ton Paris, who is indeed an eminent specialist. The 
dictionary goes on to state that the brotherhood was 
founded by Roumanille, "about 1835." According to 
Gaston Paris it was founded by Mistral on the 21st of 
May, 1854. 

Of course a name-book like this has no space to waste 
upon theories and conjectures, like those in which Shake- 
speare scholarship unfortunately abounds. Yet the 
notice of Shakespeare's " Macbeth " is largely made up 
of a tissue of conjectures which no one, so far as I know, 
accepts. We are informed in large type at the begin- 
ning of the article that this tragedy was " first played 
in Scotland about 1601, but revised by Shakespeare and 
produced at court about 1606, and on the public stage 
in 1610." A greater number of unverified statements 
could scarcely have been juggled into so few words. 
If there be any evidence that " Macbeth " was first 
played in Scotland, that it was afterwards revised by 
Shakespeare, that it was produced at coiirt about 1606, 
or at any time, that a term of years elapsed between its 
revision for production at court and its public repre- 
sentation, all the recent editors, including Furness, Fur- 
nivall, and Wright, must have entered into a conspiracy 
to suppress such evidence. 

The name " Juliet " is marked as if accented on the 
last syllable, though to accent it so would be to do vio- 
lence to the metre whenever the word occurs, either in 
" Romeo and Juliet " or in "Measure for Measure." 

Infelicities of style are much less frequent than 
errors like those I have cited. We are told of Harriet 
Martineau that " At the age of sixteen she was very 
deaf"; it would be very interesting to know whether 
she ceased to be deaf when she arrived at the age of 
seventeen. 

Sometimes there is a relative over-fulness of inform- 
ation, and again the brevity of statement is extremely 
bald. The fictitious creations of several novelists are 
somewhat fully characterized: Esmeralda, Becky Sharp, 
Mrs. Poyser, Mrs. Gamp, and Mrs. Harris, for example, 
receive their share of space. Of Me'rime'e's " Carmen," 



on the other hand, we learn nothing, save that it is a 
story " published in 1847." In consideration of the cir- 
cumstance that a well-known opera has been based upon 
it, a line or two of fine print should have been spared 
for a slight account of the story and its heroine. I could 
give scores of similar examples. Space, of course, is 
very limited, but a better editor would have made it. 

In the distribution of space to distinguished names 
may be found one of the surest criteria of editorial 
judgment. I have accordingly tested this dictionary 
with regard to the relative prominence it accords to 
the biographies of some two hundred famous men. My 
list of these names, arranged upon a scale of inches, is 
an amazing document. I must premise that this cyclo- 
pedia is printed in 1085 triple-column pages, each col- 
umn measuring ten and three-eighths inches. Some 
34,000 inches do not afford too much space in which to 
record important proper names of all sorts from the 
beginning of the world. Even were but one-fourth of 
an inch given to each entry, great care would have to 
be exercised in the selection. The present editor varies 
the length of his articles from one line up to nearly two 
columns. 

The longest article I have noticed is that upon Na- 
poleon, seventeen and one-half inches; or, including 
the following article upon the Napoleonic Wars, twenty- 
one and one-half inches, i. e., more than two columns. 
William the Conqueror gets nine inches; Washington, 
eight; Cffisar, Charlemagne, and Grant, respectively, 
about three; Alexander and Hannibal, an inch and a 
half each. Among statesmen, Gladstone fills seven and 
one-half inches, Lincoln four and one-half, Franklin 
three and one-half, Webster less than three, Bismarck 
and Richelieu two each, Pericles scarcely more than an 
inch. Among prophets, saints, and divines, Mohammed 
fills an entire column (ten and one-half inches), Zoroas- 
ter six, Moses and Buddha about five each, Jesus three, 
St. Paul, St. Peter, Confucius, Swedenborg, Spurgeon, 
and Beecher, respectively, about two, St. Benedict and 
Talmage an inch and a half each, St. Francis of Assisi 
one inch, General Booth and Channing somewhat less. 
There is a notice of the Franciscans but none of the 
Benedictines. It was taken for granted that Benedict 
and his great foundation, with its untold effect for good 
upon the human culture, were of no more interest than 
the performances of the Reverend T. DeWitt Talmage. 
It can hardly be urged that this is because Talmage is 
an American and a contemporary, for no especial favor 
is shown to either of these two classes. For example, no 
more space is given to the illustrious Channing than to 
a certain old English divine named Laurence Chaderton, 
and the founder of the Salvation Army bulks no bigger 
than the Girondin Bishop Fauchet. One is at a loss how 
to account for the circumstance that in this dictionary 
Jesus and St. Paul together sum up but half the sum 
of Mohammed! Have the editors gone upon the gen- 
erous assumption that " the general reader " would be 
sufficiently acquainted with the details of the lives and 
influence of the two founders of Christianity ? Why 
then should Mr. Gladstone, who is a familiar figure, be 
accorded seven times as much space as Pericles, and 
nearly four times as much as either Bismarck or Rich- 
elieu ? 

If there be any theory or principle for this prevail- 
ing want of proportion in the distribution of space, I 
have been unable to discover it. The examples here 
cited give but a faint notion of the editoral confusion 
of mind upon this vital point. I say confusion of mind, 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



347 



but I cannot help wondering whether mind have any- 
thing to do with it, and whether this dictionary was not, 
like the Epicurean Universe, " formed by a fortuitous 
concourse " of articles. 

In literature and music, an obtuseness if possible even 
greater is frequently shown to the relative rank of in- 
dividuals. Shakespeare and Schiller lead with a col- 
umn and a quarter (about thirteen inches each); to 
Goethe is allotted about a column (thirteen inches); 
Swift has nine inches; Dante, Ben Jonson, Voltaire, 
and Wagner, are given respectively about seven inches; 
while Ariosto, Boccaccio, Beethoven, and Montaigne are 
respectively despatched in from two to three inches. 
The'ophile Gautier, a secondary or tertiary figure, usurps 
the large space of five inches, principally filled with an 
enumeration of his writings, many of them of quite 
minor importance. He and his works might be of 
much greater importance than they are, without entit- 
ling a figure of such purely sesthetic interest to more 
notice than any one of the following, to select a few 
typical names at random from the literatures of differ- 
ent nations: Bacon, Byron, Dryden, Samuel Johnson, 
Tennyson, Cervantes, Calderon, Alfieri, Petrarch, 
Balzac, Corneille, Rousseau, Sainte - Beuve, Heine, 
Herder, Klopstock, Kant, Tolstoi, Turgenev, or any 
great name in Greek literature or philosophy save 
Homer. What critic will support the editor in conceiv- 
ing Gautier as more important, or even more interest- 
ing to " the general reader," than the least of these 
great men? Yet this is not an extreme example: at 
least, I can give many such. Thus, James Granger, an 
English book - collector, receives three and one -half 
inches space, as much as the editor feels able to spare 
to Bacon, and more than is accorded Plato, Rousseau, 
Renan, and a hundred others of first -rate interest; 
Scribe gets also three and one-half, as much as either 
Hawthorne or Leopardi; James Shirley, a third-rate 
dramatist of the decadence, three and one-half, more 
than Marlowe, or Massinger, or John Ford, or John 
Webster, or Beaumont. Fletcher, however, receives the 
enormous space of seven and one-half inches, as much 
as Voltaire or Dante; Robert Greene gets three inches, 
more than Pope or Wordsworth; Gottsched and 
Shadwell bulk bigger than Heine, or Lamartine, or 
Schopenhauer; William Broome gets more notice than 
Emerson or Robert Browning, and almost twice as much 
as Mrs. Browning, who, in the good company of St. 
Francis and of Dostoyevski (no saint, he!) finds her- 
self prisoned in the nutshell of an inch. 

As I have already remarked, no especial favor is 
shown to contemporaries : thus, Leslie Stephen and 
John Morley get a little more than an inch each, A. J. 
Balfour and Mr. Bryce about half an inch. No one of 
these men, famous, brilliant, influential, productive, and 
learned as they are, three of them men who are mould- 
ing the policy of Great Britain, all of them men who 
are moulding the thought of Greater Britain, no one 
of these is accorded even as much space as is given to 
that respectable and commonplace professor, Henry 
Morley. Space might at least have been found to men- 
tion John Morley's great work on " Diderot and the 
Encyclopaedists." 

One of the most difficult questions for the editor of 
such a work to decide must be that of the relative prom- 
inence which should be given to criticism and comment. 
This problem also has been evaded in the present work. 
Some of the biographical articles are noteworthy for the 
precision with which they state the social, cultural, or 



historic significance of their subjects; on the other hand, 
many of those I have examined are absolutely bald in 
their adherence to facts and dates. Compare, e. g., the 
articles on Herbart and on Lotze. In many cases rel- 
atively copious citations are made from such easily ac- 
cessible books as Saintsbury's " History of French Lit- 
erature," Ticknor's " Spanish Literature," Morley's 
" English Writers." When such citations are not at 
hand, everything in the nature of criticism or interpre- 
tative comment is usually (not always) omitted. Touch- 
ing Jeffrey, a brief and admirable sentence is quoted 
from Bagehot, who manages to hit off Jeffrey's signifi- 
cance ; touching Klopstock, on the other hand, there is 
not a word to give us a clue to the poet's personal or 
literary character, to the quality and interest of his 
work, to his place and influence in German literature, 
we are not so much as told that he was " a very Ger- 
man Milton." Of Lessing we are informed that " in 
1750 began a friendship with Voltaire which had an 
important influence over his development " ; but as to 
the course of this development, and its significance for 
human culture, there is not a word. As a matter of 
fact, there was no friendship, scarcely an acquaintance- 
ship, with Voltaire; hence the inference as to its sup- 
posed " influence over his development " proves nuga- 
tory. 

On the same page with the Lessing article, a long 
quotation (sixteen lines) from Saintsbury is given, de- 
fining the place of Mile, de Lespinasse in French liter- 
ature. To this note alone more space is devoted than 
to the entire article upon Mrs. Browning, while the 
whole article " Lespinasse " is longer than that devoted 
to an incomparably greater writer in the same genre, 
Mme. de Se'vignd. Evidently, therefore, the prefer- 
ence given to Mile, de Lespinasse over such command- 
ing figures in literature as Ariosto, Boccaccio, Browning, 
Emerson, Hawthorne, Heine, Lamartine, Leopardi (to 
pause in mid-alphabet) cannot fairly be attributed to 
the intelligible principle involved in the watchword 
place aux dames ! Examples of such incongruities in 
the matter of interpretation and comment might be in- 
definitely multiplied. On the whole, French literature 
seems to be more intelligently treated than German, or 
even English literature ; but in the former field the use 
of scissors and paste in the dissection and appropriation 
of Saintsbury's " French literature " has been so free as 
to seem to call for some prefatory acknowledgement at 
least, if not for apology. 

It would be interesting to know which member of the 
staff of " eminent specialists " was consulted in the selec- 
tion of the names of contemporary men of science who 
are entitled to notice in such a work. The selection is 
eccentric and the notices are out of proportion. One 
looks in vain for the names of noted naturalists who 
now stand for zoology, botany, and geology, in this 
country. The name of Eliza Youmans is given, os- 
tensibly because she is an American botanist; while 
those of Lesquereaux, Englemann, Vasey, Watson, 
Goodale, and Farlow are omitted. James Orton, the 
writer of a text-book on zoology and author of an un- 
important book of travels, is mentioned, while Verrill, 
Pourtales, Sydney I. Smith, W. H. Brooks, and W. H. 
Edwards are overlooked. F. B. Meek, the paleontolo- 
gist, is mentioned; Worthen, his collaborator, is not. 
Hayden and Powell, directors of two of the national sur- 
veys, are spoken of; Wheeler and King, two other direc- 
tors, are not. Wright, a popular writer on glacial geol- 
ogy, is mentioned; while Chamberlin, Salisbury, and 



348 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Uphana, the workers and original writers on glacial geol- 
ogy, are omitted. Winchell, known for his text-books 
and popular writings on geological topics, is mentioned ; 
but Charles A. White, the author of one hundred and 
fifty-five original and valuable contributions to the sci- 
ence of geology, is omitted. Liais, Hartt, and Derby, 
Brazilian geologists, and Shaler, Marcou, and E. S. Dana, 
American geologists, are mentioned ; and the following, 
who are, to say the least, quite as well known, are 
omitted: Chamberlin, Dutton, Emmons, Fontaine, Gil- 
bert, Hyatt, Irving, Iddings, Lesley, Lesquereux, Pum- 
pelly, H. S. and G. H. Williams, C. A. White, Whit- 
field, and Walcott, in this country; Heim and de Loriol 
in Switzerland; Beyrich, Benneke, Credner, Hauche- 
corn, Neumayr, Richthofen, Rosenbusch, and Zittel, of 
Germany; Suess of Austria; Barrois, Gaudry, Lappar- 
ent, and Michel LeVy of France; Capellini of Italy; 
Karpinsky and Tschernytschew of Russia. In many 
cases the text is out of all proportion to the prominence 
(among scientific men at least) of the subjects. For 
example, E. S. Morse, whose claim to recognition seems 
to be based chiefly upon an elementary text-book on 
zoology (190 pages) occupies sixteen lines; while James 
Hall, the author of more than a hundred original con- 
tributions to science, many of them large beautifully 
illustrated quarto volumes, is given nine lines. A. S. 
Packard is given a dozen lines, while Alexander Agassiz 
is despatched in five. Such selections and discrimina- 
tions must give those who seek information in this book 
an entirely erroneous impression regarding science and 
the men who are its life. 

The preface leads one to expect to find the South 
American list, especially the Brazilian part of it, quite 
satisfactory, but between current newspaper literature, 
chorographic literature, and the Aemanach de Gotha, 
there are some important omissions. Custodio Jose* de 
Mello certainly occupies all the space he is entitled to, 
but Saldanha da Gama, a more important figure in Bra- 
zilian politics, Saldanha Marinho, for years the head 
and front of republicanism in Brazil, and Joaquim Na- 
buco, the leader of the abolition movement, are not even 
mentioned. A few other noteworthy omissions from the 
Brazilian list taken at random are: Barao de Cotigipe, 
a leading politician, senator, prime minister, and head 
of a financial reform that did much to save Brazilian 
credit, Couto de Magalhaes, the author of a number of 
important works on history, travels, and ethnology; 
Nicolau Joaquim Moreira, the leading agriculturist 
and agricultural writer of Brazil; Mouchez, the author 
of about thirty of the most important books and charts 
that relate to the coast and hydrography of Brazil; 
Felisberto Caldeira Brant, the holder of the third dia- 
mond contract, and one of the most striking figures in 
the early history of Minas ; Silva Xavier, or " Tiraden- 
tes," the early martyr to republicanism (as if John 
Brown of Ossawatamie had been left out) ; Homem de 
Mello, the author of some fifty books and papers on 
travels and geography; Moreira de Azevedo, the author 
of more than thirty historical publications ; Mello 
Moraes, the author of more than thirty important books 
and papers on history and medicine ; not to mention such 
writers as Maria Graham and Luccock, whose books 
upon the periods they wrote about are classics of their 
kind. 

The names of South American places, so far as they 
have been examined, seem to be well chosen. We note 
the absence of Serro, or Villa de Principe, where dia- 
monds were first found in America, and for many years 
the chief city of the diamond district. 



Out of a score of the most prominent writers on the 
ceramic arts, we find only the names of Brongniart and 
Champfleury; those of Audsley, Bowes, Ebelmen, Gar- 
nier, Jacquemart, Salve"tat, are omitted. 

In fine, this is a publisher's book, over-hastily 
concocted for subscription sale. It seems to me dis- 
tinctly inferior in quality of editorial supervision to 
" The Century Dictionary," a work which I had 
the pleasure of reviewing, volume by volume, in 
these columns. Although " The Century Diction- 
ary " is also defaced by many errors, doubtless due 
to the haste with which it was produced, it is dis- 
tinctly a scholarly work. u The Century Cyclo- 
pedia of Names " is, as I have shown, in many re- 
spects unscholarly. Its chief fault is want of pro- 
portion and perspective. Nevertheless, it is a very 
useful book to have at hand. It contains under one 
alphabet an enormous amount of more or less exact 
information about gods, men, and horses, countries, 
towns, and houses, fictitious characters, books, and 
battles. It gives a date for everything, and I have 
found but a small proportion of the dates examined 
to be wrong. I expect to continue to use the work 
with profit, just as we use the predictions of the 
weather service without accepting them as infallible. 
It should be speedily revised by competent special- 
ists. If I could believe that these strictures might 
have some influence in inducing the publishers to 
take in hand such a revision, I should not account 
the time spent upon these tests as wasted.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The study 
of English 
lyric poetry. 



Our generation has seen a steady 
growth of interest in the study of the 
lyric, due in part doubtless to the rec- 
ognition of the fact that for some two hundred years 
past the lyric has been the only living form of poe- 
try. Palgrave's " Golden Treasury " was the first 
adequate selection of English lyrics, and gave a 
new impetus to the study of the subject. Ward's 
" English Poets " covered a wider field, but helped 
forward the same movement. Since then, our knowl- 
edge of the English lyric in the period of its great- 
est perfection has been widened through the re- 
searches and the publications of scholars like Mr. 
Bullen and Dr. Grosart. The results of these studies 
are seen in several popular publications of recent 
date. Professor Schelling's " Elizabethan Lyrics " 
has already been noticed in these columns. Dr. 
James Baldwin also has recently edited a volume of 
" Choice English Lyrics " (Silver, Burdett & Co.) of 
a popular nature. Catholicity of taste is an excel- 
lent thing, but even the most catholic taste would hes- 
itate to admit into a volume of three hundred and 
fifty pages, and covering the entire field of the En- 
glish lyric, as many selections from such versifiers 
as Macaulay, Moore, Hood, Rogers, Kirke White, 
and Owen Meredith, as Dr. Baldwin has seen fit to

admit to his volume. The editor's principle of clas- 
sification, moreover, is unprofitable in that it admits 
much which is not properly lyric at all (such as the 
ballad of "King John and the Abbot"), and that 
it secures the inclusion of many pieces because of 
the interest of their subject-matter ; whereas in the 
lyric proper, motive and form and style, and not 
subject-matter, are the all- important things. A 
selection of quite a different character, " The Golden 
Pomp, a Procession of English Lyrics from Surrey 
to Shirley" (Lippincott), has been made by Mr. 
A. T. Quiller Couch. The lover of the Elizabethan 
lyric now begins to feel overwhelmed with an em- 
barrassment of riches, and will find it hard to make 
a choice between the various anthologies : Bullen's, 
Schelling's, Saintsbury's u Seventeenth Century 
Lyrics," and " The Golden Pomp." To complete 
the roll, a volume of selections from " The English 
Poets of the Seventeenth Century from Donne to 
Dryden," by Professor Briggs of Harvard, is in 
preparation for the " Athenaeum Press Series," 
while Professor Gummere is engaged in editing a 
selection of Middle English Lyrics. Of the three 
hundred and sixty-one pieces in Mr. Quiller Couch's 
volume, it is interesting to note that seventy are 
also found in Palgrave, and some one hundred and 
twenty in Schelling ; a fact significant not only of 
the richness of the field drawn upon, but also of the 
tendency among critics to agree upon a certain num- 
ber of the older lyrics as recognized classics of their 
kind. Schelling's contains only two hundred and 
fifty-eight selections in all, so that nearly one-half 
of his number, it will be seen, are agreed upon by 
both editors. The plan of Mr. Quiller Couch's vol- 
ume is somewhat more popular than that of Pro- 
fessor Schelling's, while its range also is slightly 
longer, including as Elizabethans all authors born 
during the reign of Elizabeth. Schelling gives no 
selections from Herrick, Herbert, and other lyrists 
contemporary with these accomplished singers. Mr. 
Quiller Couch's arrangement is ingenious and satis- 
factory for the general reader, following a natural 
but elastic grouping by motives and topics, which 
begins with spring, youth, love, and pastoral peace, 
proceeds through flower-motives, evanescence, ab- 
sence, carpe diem, melancholy, lullabies, dirges, and 
all the other familiar and charming themes of our 
older lyrics, and ends with winter and farewell. A 
happy effect of subtle harmony results for the reader 
who follows the course of the volume from begin- 
ning to finish. Where in literature can the Eliza- 
bethan lyric at its best be matched for perfume, 
grace, fervor, and artlessly artful melody? 

In his volume on " Rhythm and Har- 
mony in Poetry and Music " (Put- 
nam), to which is added an essay on 
" Music as a Representative Art," Professor Ray- 
mond continues the series of aesthetic studies, the 
succeeding volumes of which have been noted in 
THE DIAL. In the first essay in the present volume 
we have a continuation of "The Genesis of Art 



Essays in 
^Esthetics. 



Form "; in the second, a companion to " Poetry as 
a Representative Art." Like its predecessors, this 
volume is an interesting work ; careful and grate- 
fully systematic in its plan, although somewhat hard 
reading. Like them, it is the product of much 
thought and observation ; and it is thoroughly and 
well illustrated. For ourselves, we always fail to 
find in Professor Raymond's theory that stimulat- 
ing and suggestive quality which is usually a note 
of those speculations that really open to us a valu- 
able truth, and we sometimes fail to find a certain 
closeness of argument which might be desired. In 
the space at hand we can give but the slightest illus- 
trations of these views, and we will confine ourselves 
to the essay on " Music as a Representative Art." 
As to this question we are much inclined to inquire, 
What of it all? Such generalities as music can rep- 
resent are hardly enough to enable us to think of 
it as we do of painting. It is representative, but as 
a rule, we cannot tell what it represents, until we 
are informed. And there still remains so much in 
music that is not representative, that, even accept- 
ing Professor Raymond's showing, it seems a little 
futile to lay much weight upon that which is. But 
everyone will not accept Professor Raymond's show- 
ing. He is of the view, for instance, that variation 
of pitch is representative in music as in language. 
Now variation of pitch is representative in language, 
but in different languages it represents very differ- 
ent things. Professor Raymond speaks entirely of 
pitch in England. But pitch in the South German 
dialects is a very different matter, and in the Scan- 
dinavian dialects it is different still; and so in 
French and Welsh. Indeed, in almost every lan- 
guage the variation of pitch has some particular sig- 
nification. With which of these will music agree? 
Professor Raymond finds an analogy with English, 
which seems to show that foreign composers are 
very complaisant. But the analogy of language is 
not the sole basis of the theory. The author consid- 
ers many musical passages, and points out the sig- 
nificance of many musical effects. In some cases 
we think Professor Raymond imaginative. In many 
cases the music really does have the meaning as- 
cribed to it, after the meaning has been suggested. 
Such examples, however, do not amount to proof. 
A single case in which a certain effect had not a 
certain significance would play havoc with a score 
in which it had. For such reasons as these one can 
rarely accept Professor Raymond's books without 
reserve, although they are such as always to com- 
mand interest and attention. 



The small 
black peoples 
of the world. 



The second volume of Messrs. Ap- 
pletons' " Anthropological Series " 
is a translation, by Prof. Frederick 
Starr, the editor of the series, of M. de Quatre- 
fages' work on " The Pygmies." It is an interest- 
ing popular account of the small black peoples of 
the world, their history, migrations, affinities, and 
present distribution. The ancients were acquainted 
more or less fully with five small black populations,

two in Asia, a third toward the sources of the Nile, 
a fourth a little to the east of the preceding, and a 
fifth far to the southwest. These peoples they called 
" Pygmies." Some of these tribes, much diminished 
in numbers, are still found near the regions which 
they formerly occupied. All of these small black 
peoples M. de Quatrefages considers as " fragments 
of two human races, well characterized as blacks, oc- 
cupying, the one in Asia, the other in Africa, a con- 
siderable area, and both of them including not only 
tribes or distinct peoples, but even sub-races." These 
two races are called the Negritos, including the small 
black peoples of Asia, of Malaysia, and of Melan- 
esia ; and the Negrillos, including the small black 
tribes of Africa. The Eastern Pygmies, or Negritos, 
are divided into two geographical groups, the con- 
tinental and the insular. Traces of them are found 
in Japan, Formosa, the Philippine Islands, Borneo, 
New Guinea, and numerous other islands ; possibly 
also in Australia. On the mainland they inhabited 
parts of the Malay peninsula, of Indo-China, and 
of India. The Negrillos, or Pygmies of Africa, the 
second of the two races, are represented to-day by 
the Hottentots and Bushmen. It is hardly neces- 
sary to say that M. de Quatrefages' book is a thor- 
ough and scientific ethnological study. It will prove 
interesting, not to the scientific student alone, but 
to every intelligent reader. 

Memoirs of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. have 

an aide-de-camp done good service in issuing in a 
of Napoleon. 8 i n gl e compact volume, entitled "An 

Aide-de-Camp of Napoleon," the personal and an- 
ecdotal portion of Count Philippe de Segur's vol- 
uminous " History, Memoirs, and Miscellanea," pub- 
lished in 1873. The memoir is one of the most 
charming and graphic as well as most instructive 
records of Napoleonic times the work of a brave 
and honorable gentleman of the old regime, who, 
breaking perforce with the traditions of his ances- 
tors, bowed to the new conditions and served France 
as loyally under Bonaparte as he would have served 
her under a Capet. General of division, Peer of 
France, and Academician, Count de Se'gur lived for 
the greater part of a century, making a brilliant fig- 
ure in war, politics, and letters, and serving through- 
out the Imperial wars mainly on the Emperor's 
staff. The present volume forms a dramatic per- 
sonal record, and is replete with pen-sketches of 
Napoleon and of the writer's companions in arms. 
In the introduction the author pays an eloquent 
tribute to the memory of his father, the celebi-ated 
ambassador to the Court of Catherine of Russia, 
and he recounts also the first years of his own im- 
poverished and proscribed childhood, in the midst 
of the whirlwind of the Revolution. Count de 
Se'gur unhesitatingly fixes upon Danton the respon- 
sibility of that grim political invention, the Reign 
of Terror. Danton himself, he avers, boldly as- 
sumed it ; and he quotes him as replying, " with 
his too well-known cynicism," to his (M. Se'gur's) 
father, when challenged as to his share in the Sep- 



tember massacres : " Sir, you forget to whom you 
are speaking ; you forget that we are the riffraff, 
that we have issued from the gutter ; that with your 
opinions we should soon fall back into it, and that 
we can only govern by the law of fear." The vol- 
ume is a presentable one outwardly, and Mr. H. A. 
Patchett-Martin's translation is smooth and grace- 
ful. The frontispiece portrait of Napoleon indi- 
cates the trend of the narrative. 



A delightful edition of Spenser's " Faerie 

edition of the Queene," now issuing in monthly 
"Faerie Queene." partg f rom the London press of Mr. 

George Allen, and obtainable in this country from 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co., is one of the most beauti- 
ful examples of modern bookmaking imaginable, and 
the impecunious book-lover may well envy the for- 
tunate persons who become possessors of the thou- 
sand copies to which the work is limited. In stating 
this number, we do not take into account the 
twenty-seven additional copies on Japanese vellum, 
which only millionaires can hope to acquire. The 
work will be completed in nineteen parts, six of 
which, containing Books I. and II., have already 
been received by us. The text is a result of care- 
ful collation of several early editions, made by the 
loving care of Mr. Thomas J. Wise. Each part 
has illustrations in the shape of decorative canto- 
headings and tail-pieces, besides several full-page 
designs, all from the facile and sympathetic pencil 
of Mr. Walter Crane. The pagination of the work 
is consecutive, although each Book is intended to 
form a distinct volume, and has a title-page of its 
own. The parts vary from eighty to one hundred 
and twelve pages each, and are exquisitely printed 
on unbleached handmade paper. 

Mr. Curtin is no novice in collecting 

Irish Fairy and f o lkJ ore nor J s his volume of " Tales 
Ghost tales. ... 

oi the Irish rairies and of the Ghost 
World " (Little, Brown, & Co.) his first contribu- 
tion of Irish tales. This volume, however, differs 
from any of his earlier work in character. In it he 
presents the present belief in fairies and ghosts. 
Ten per cent of the population of Southwest Mun- 
ster, where these tales were gathered, are to-day firm 
believers in fairies and uneasy spirits, and a large 
proportion of the remainder have a more or less 
definite fear that such beings exist. The Irish fai- 
ries and ghosts appear to be kin ; and in his intro- 
duction to the book Mr. Nutt just hints the question 
whether fairy belief has not sprung from ancestor 
worship. The " good people " of Munster belief 
are generally malicious, and do little good to com- 
mon people unless they have already received some 
important help from these. One interesting feature 
of the tales is the way in which events are narrated 
of people still alive, or but recently dead, and known 
to the hearers. Yet the stories in some cases must 
have been told the same in incident long, long 
ago. It will do anyone good to read here of " fairy 
forts " and " fairy stroke," of fairy infants need-

ing nursing, and of cows stolen by the little people 
for milk supply. Apart from the amusement in 
the reading, one gets from this book a glimpse of a 
veritable ancient religion. 

We heartily wish the "Letters of 

S":^L e , Cd ia Thaxte f (Houghton) might 
fall into the hands or every Amer- 
ican woman. The dainty book, with its enforced 
graces and dignities of phrase and sentiment, is re- 
plete with the fine and gentle spirit of true woman- 
liness old-fashioned womanliness, which we firmly 
believe (with all deference to " new and improved " 
ideals) to be humanity's moral crown and jewel, 
and the tap-root and original of the social virtues. 
A fine and true verse is that of the Koran : " A son 
wins paradise at his mother's knees." The letters 
range from 1856 (when the writer was in her 
twenty-first year) to 1894, the year of her death ; 
and they form a true index to the character of the 
mistress of " Appledore " and the unique life she 
led in her island home. The letters are tastefully 
mounted, and there are five portraits of Mrs. Thax- 
ter, together with an appreciative introductory sketch 
by the editors, A. F. and R. L. 

Mr. Walter Cranston Lamed de- 
scribes his " Churches and Castles 
of Mediaeval France " (Scribner) as 
a "record of a traveller's impressions." The book 
is more than this modest (and nowadays rather 
unpromising) expression implies. Mr. Lamed has 
interwoven his descriptions with enough historical 
fact to enable general readers to see in the struct- 
ures noted something more than mere specimens of 
mediaeval architecture, as well as to appreciate the 
spirit of the French nation in assuming the enor- 
mous outlay required for restoring and preserving 
them. The vandalism of the Revolution has been 
generously atoned for by such works, for instance, 
as the restoration of Carcassonne at an expense thus 
far of about $700,000. Mr. Larned writes simply 
and concisely, and his book is, we should say, pre- 
cisely the one needed by the average visitor to the 
places described. The volume contains twenty-four 
full-page photographic plates. 

Mr. P. H. Ditchfield's little treatise 
on " Books Fatal to their Authors " 
(Book-Lover's Library: Armstrong) 
concerns itself chiefly with the lives of literary mar- 
tyrs in the more literal sense authors, that is, who 
expiated their candor or their temerity by the cell, 
the rack, or the faggot, rather than the mere vic- 
tims of criticism or of public neglect. Mr. Ditch- 
field's list is a long one, and it is mainly a roll of 
honor, being studded with such names as Huss, 
Tyndale, Savonarola, Bruno, Galileo, Sidney, Sarpi, 
Prynne, etc. A chapter is included on " Booksell- 
ers and Publishers," a class whose misfortunes 
might well form a special subject of inquiry. Alto- 
gether, the little volume contains a good deal of cu- 
rious and suggestive matter. 



Literary 
Martyrs. 



Ten years ago Mr. Charles Lowe 
A. condensed published an elaborate life of Bis- 

life of Bismarck. * . , , , 

marck in a thousand large pages. 
He has now given us the cream of that work in two 
hundred and fifty small pages, under the same title, 
"Prince Bismarck" (Roberts). In the new work 
the author has the advantage of treating his hero's 
career as a completed whole, and of such new ma- 
terials and such corrections as ten years have 
brought. His many years of residence as a news- 
paper correspondent in the different countries of 
Europe have furnished an admirable preparation 
for his task, both in intimate knowledge of peoples 
and politics, and in skill in putting things effectively. 
The book furnishes a vivid picture of the greatest 
of modem statesmen, and a trustworthy narrative 
of his career, allowing somewhat for an author's 
bias in his hero's favor. We believe that his esti- 
mate of Bismarck's work will be ratified by the 
judgment of impartial history.

ical characteristics and career ot Mr. 
Gladstone than has Mr. Henry W. Lucy, whose par- 
liamentary diaries, extending from 1874 to 1892, 
are well known to the public. We expect to find in 
his recent book, " Gladstone : A Study from Life " 
(Roberts), a sketch of that marvellous career as 
vivid as a practised literary skill, an intimate knowl- 
edge, and a sympathetic appreciation can make it ; 
and we are not disappointed. Though the narrow 
limits of a small volume preclude a detailed survey 
of the sixty-two years of incessant and beneficent 
activity, the author brings out more clearly the im- 
portant achievements and salient points of the states- 
man's splendid career. His position as eye-witness 
of the scenes he describes enables him to give reality 
and vividness to his account by the interesting de- 
tails and touches he constantly adds.

ring narrative of military exploits in the Crimean 
War, the Indian Mutiny, and in various parts of 
the earth where British enterprise ( to use no harsher 
word) has called for military support. The quali- 
ties that go to make a good soldier, the attractions 
and hardships and disappointments of the soldier's 
life, are well brought out in the story.

and a biographical sketch by Mr. N. H. Dole. The vol-

nine is an excellent example of neat bookmaking, and 
is published at the low price of one dollar. 

The " Complete Geography " of Mr. A. E. Frye 
(Ginn) impresses us as an exceedingly well-considered 
and carefully-planned text-book. Commercial relations 
are emphasized and illustrated by an admirable series 
of special maps. Indeed, the work is exceptionally rich 
in maps of all sorts, including a 24-page supplement of 
maps alone, which in itself would make a very satisfac- 
tory family atlas. Relief maps also abound, telling their 
complex story at a glance. The many illustrations are 
both well-chosen and well-engraved. Such a manual 
as this offers a marked contrast to the poverty-stricken 
" geographies " of twenty or thirty years ago. 

" The Constitutional Antiquities of Sparta and 
Athens " (Macmillan) is a translation, by Messrs. E. J. 
Brooks and T. Nieklin, of the first volume of Dr. Gus- 
tav Gilbert's " Handbuch der Griechischen Staatsalter- 
thiimer." A few English references are supplied but 
no substantial departure from the original has been at- 
tempted. Dr. J. E. Sandys contributes an introductory 
note to the translation, speaking in high terms of the 
usefulness and accuracy of the work, and of its popu- 
larity as a text-book. The volume is one of 463 pages, 
each of which is about half text and about half footnote. 

The compiler of " What Shall I Play ? " (Gladstone 
Publishing Co.) has requested a large number of mu- 
sicians and teachers of the piano and organ to supply 
him with brief lists of pleasing and attractive compo- 
sitions, classified according to the difficulties they offer, 
and accompanied by whatever brief comment seems nec- 
essary. These lists, to the number of something like 
a hundred, are printed in the book of which the title 
has been quoted. In the list of contributors we find a 
few well-known names, such as those of Biilow, Mr. 
Arthur Foote, Dr. Robert Goldbeck, and Mr. W. H. 
Sherwood. Most of the contributors have avoided the 
classical compositions likely to occur to anybody, and 
rather sought to give titles taken from the less familiar 
and more modern repertory. The book ought to prove 
very helpful to both professionals and amateurs. 



XiITERARY NOTES. 



The three parts of " Henry VI.," in as many volumes, 
are the latest additions to the charming " Temple " 
Shakespeare. 

Mr. Samuel L. Clemens is to start in August on a 
lecture-tour around the world, beginning with the Sand- 
wich Islands and ending with the British Isles. 

A new " Economic Classic " (Macmillan) is a reprint 
of Thomas Mun's treatise (published posthumously in 
1664) on " England's Treasure by Forraign Trade." 

Sir Frederick Pollock is now on the way to this coun- 
try, having accepted the invitation of Harvard Univer- 
sity to address the Law School upon the occasion of its 
annual Commencement. 

John Gait's " Annals of the Parish " and " The Ayr- 
shire Legatees," with an introduction by Canon Ainger, 
is the latest volume in the acceptable Macmillan series 
of reprints of the popular fiction of a past generation. 

No. 56 of the Old South Leaflets " is timely indeed, 
being a reprint of the Message in which President Mon- 
roe enunciated the Doctrine which has gone by his 
name ever since. The pamphlet ought to be brought 



to the attention of the brilliant young men who conduct 
our foreign policy through the medium of the news- 
papers which they serve as reporters. 

Our recent remarks upon the high plane of the work 
done at the Plymouth School of Applied Ethics are am- 
ply borne out by the programme for the coming season 
(July 7 August 9), which offers fare even more attrac- 
tive and substantial than has been supplied in previous 
years. 

Miss Emily Faithfull, news of whose death came on 
the third of this month, had many American friends, 
made during three visits to the United States, and her 
loss will be keenly felt on this side of the Atlantic. 
She did much effective work in many good causes, and 
her several books represent but a small fraction of her 
life-long activity. 

" The Bachelor of Arts " is the title of the new col- 
lege monthly edited by Mr. John Seymour Wood, with 
the collaboration of Messrs. Walter Camp and Edward 
S. Martin. The first number, dated May 1, has appeared, 
and is beautifully printed, although the narrow format 
is not exactly pleasing. The contents, if we except Mrs. 
Todd's paper on the letters of Emily Dickinson and 
Mr. John Corbin's notes on college life at Oxford, .im- 
press us as rather sophomorical, and hardly what were 
to be expected in a magazine started under such prom- 
ising auspices. 

Southern California's young and agreeable literary 
periodical, " The Land of Sunshine " (published at Los 
Angeles), celebrates the beginning of its second year 
by assuming a more distinctively magazine form and 
donning a new and striking cover, in its issue for June. 
The illustrations of the number are unexpectedly good, 
and the reading matter is varied and attractive. The 
" local color " of course predominates, both in text and 
pictures; and this, we fancy, will be to most readers 
the chief charm of the bright little perodical, for the 
" local color " of Southern California is something that 
its lovers can hardly have too much of. 

The London correspondent of the New York " Critic " 
recently attended a dinner of the Omar Khayyam Club, 
and gives some interesting particulars concerning the 
customs of that organization : " The followers of Omar 
are expected to present themselves at the board, wear- 
ing the red rose of their poet : the guests assume a 
white rose in distinction. Such members as neglect the 
badge are summoned for an explanation by the Presi- 
dent early in the proceedings, and have each in turn to 
make such excuses as they may have at their disposal. 
Unless the President's special leave is secured, it is ex- 
pected that members will drink red wine. The first 
toast upon the list is the immortal memory of Omar, 
which is drunk in silence, all standing." 

Some years ago, a paragraph went the rounds of the 
newspapers to the effect that Bayard Taylor, in the opin- 
ion of Humboldt, " had traveled farther and seen less than 
any man he ever knew." Mr. C. V. Nye, writing to " The 
Book Buyer," thus tells the story of the origin of that 
fabrication : " A certain litterateur (no longer living in 
any sense) wrote to Mr. Taylor, asking him to give him 
a set of his works. Mr. Taylor knew no reason why he 
should do so, and simply referred the request to his 
publisher, who declined to send the books. Thereupon 
the man, through sheer malice, invented the remark 
which he put into Humboldt's mouth, embodied it in 
the paragraph, and inserted it in a column which he was 
making up for a popular weekly."
