A NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY 

On Historical Principles, founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society. 
Edited by JAMES A. H. MURRAY, B.A., London; Hon. M.A., Oxon; LL.D., Edinburgh; D.C.L., Dunelm, etc.; 

sometime President of the Philological Society; with the assistance of many scholars and men of science. 

"Every cultivated person should be interested in the progress of the 'New English Dictionary,' edited by Dr. J. A. H. 
Murray, Vice-President, and Mr. Henry Bradley, President, of the Philological Society. Among subscription books, that 
is, books necessarily issued in parts, at greater or less intervals, it is surpassed by none in intrinsic -worth or in the ease with 
which the infrequent payments can be borne. Unlike cyclopaedias, it can never become completely antiquated, and time will 
affect it mainly in the particular of neologisms ; for, as its illustrations of usage are marshalled in chronological order, the 
history of each word or meaning may be added to but cannot be detracted from and we cannot foresee the day when a sup- 
plement will be undertaken." From Evening Post Editorial, Saturday, March 25, 1893.

THE LITERATURE CONGRESSES. 

THE DIAL has given, from time to time, 
accounts of the remarkable series of gather- 
ings planned for the Exposition season by the 
World's Congress Auxiliary. These Con- 
gresses, which have been uninterruptedly in 
progress since the middle of May, are designed 
to cover all the important fields of intellectual 
activity, and each of them has been placed in 
charge of a competent local committee of ar- 
rangements, with full power to plan the ses- 
sions and extend invitations to those whom it 
is desirable should participate. Up to the 
present time, the Congresses have dealt with 
the work of representative women, with the 



public press, medicine, temperance, social re- 
form, and with the problems of commerce and 
finance. The Congresses of the present month 
will include the three subjects of music, litera- 
ture, and education, subjects relating to the 
higher aspects of culture, and thus making a 
particular appeal to the constituency addressed 
by THE DIAL. We propose, in the present 
article, to outline the more important features 
of the Literature Congresses planned for the 
week beginning with the tenth of July. 

Literature, as used in connection with these 
gatherings, is a term to be taken in a broad 
sense, as appears from the primary classifica- 
tion of the work to be done. Five sections 
have been established, dealing respectively with 
libraries, history, philology, folk-lore, and lit- 
erature proper. The work of the five sections 
will be carried on at the same time, and through- 
out the greater part of the week ; but the pro- 
grammes have been arranged, as far as it has 
been found possible to do so, with the view of 
bringing into session, at a given time, the in- 
terests least likely to conflict with one another, 
so that those in attendance upon the respective 
sections may not be unduly disturbed by the 
promptings of a divided duty. Thus the mem- 
bers of any one section will be free to at- 
tend those meetings of the others most likely 
to be attractive to them. The real work of the 
Congresses will begin on Tuesday, the evening 
of the preceding Monday being given up to an 
informal reception to the visiting members and 
the interested resident public. 

The Congress of Librarians, in charge of a 
committee having Mr. F. H. Hild, of the Chi- 
cago Public Library, as chairman, will be su- 
perimposed upon the regular annual confer- 
ence of the American Library Association. 
The Congress proper will probably occupy four 
sessions, and for these sessions more than a 
score of papers have been secured. The con- 
ference of the Association is planned to occupy 
three further sessions, for which the programmes 
have been arranged by the officers of that body. 
The public has always taken much interest in 
the meetings of the Library Association, and 
the meeting of this summer, with its unusual 
features, will probably be the most important 
ever held, as well as the most fruitful in prac- 
tical outcome. The profession of the librarian 



6 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



is growing in importance every year, and the 
public is coming more and more fully to recog- 
nize that librarians are not merely collectors 
and custodians of books, that the function 
of facilitating to the public use the libraries 
under their charge is at least as important as 
any other that they are called upon to exercise. 

The work of the section devoted to histor- 
ical literature has been undertaken with the 
cooperation of the American Historical Asso- 
ciation, by a committee having as chairman 
Dr. W. F. Poole, of the Newberry Library. 
Six sessions are planned, and for them have 
been collected upwards of thirty papers, mostly 
by American writers and upon American sub- 
jects. The healthful activity of local historical 
studies has been one of the most promising in- 
tellectual signs of recent years, and our coun- 
try has developed a school of historical inves- 
tigators hardly second to that of any other in 
industry, in scientific method, or in philosoph- 
ical outlook. A few of the more important 
papers to be read at this Congress are the fol- 
lowing : " The Inadequate Recognition of Di- 
plomatists by Historians," by President James 
B. Angell ; " Personal Explorations at Wat- 
ling Island," by Herr Rudolph Cronau, of 
Leipzig ; " Condition of Spain in the Sixteenth 
Century, "by Professor Bernard Moses ; "Early 
Slavery in Illinois," by Mr. William Henry 
Smith ; and " The Time-Element in American 
History," by Professor Moses Coit Tyler. 

The work of the Congress of Philologists 
has been planned by a committee having as 
chairman Mr. W. M. Payne, with the coop- 
eration of the American Philological Associa- 
tion, the Modern Language Association of 
America, and the American Dialect Society. 
These three societies will hold formal meet- 
ings, and their work will be supplemented 
by a number of papers obtained from outside 
sources, many of these relating to Oriental 
philology and archeology. About sixty papers 
will be included in the work of the philolog- 
ical section, and it will be necessary, during 
the greater part of the week, to hold two ses- 
sions at the same time. Among the features 
of these sessions may be mentioned the annual 
address of the President of the American Phi- 
lological Association, Professor W. G. Hale, 
upon the subject of " Democracy and Educa- 
tion," discussed in the last number of THE 
DIAL ; a paper by Mr. T. G. Pinches, of the 
British Museum, upon " Unpublished Manu- 
script Treasures "; a paper by Professor Rich- 
ard Garbe, of the University of Kbnigsberg, 



upon " The Connection between Indian and 
Greek Philosophy "; a paper by Dr. Richter, 
of Berlin, upon " The Archaeology of Cyprus "; 
a paper by Professor Emil Hausknecht, of 
Berlin, upon " Pedagogical Questions in Ger- 
many "; a paper by Dr. William C. Wins- 
low, Vice-President of the Egypt Exploration 
Fund, upon " Old Testament History in the 
Light of Recent Discoveries "; and a paper by 
Professor F. A. March, upon " The Language 
of the Sciences and a Universal Language." 
The papers above named will be read by their 
authors. Other European philologists coming 
to America for the express purpose of attend- 
ing this Congress are Professor Wilhelm Streit- 
berg, of Freiburg (Switzerland), Professor E. 
A. Sonnenschein, of Birmingham, and Profes- 
sor Hermann Osthoff, of Heidelberg. Among 
the important papers sent from Europe to the 
Congress are the following : " Assyrian Tablet 
Libraries," by Professor A. H. Sayce, of Ox- 
ford; " Canons of Etymological Investigation," 
by Professor Michel Breal, of the College de 
France ; " Koptic Art and Its Relation to Early 
Christian Ornament," by Dr. Georg Ebers ; 
and "The Great Altar at Dagr el Baharee 
(Thebes)," by Dr. Edouard Naville, a paper 
presenting the results of the author's latest ex- 
cavations. 

Extensive as is the programme of the Phi- 
lological Congress, that of the Folk-Lore sec- 
tion is still more extensive. Mr. Fletcher S. 
Bassett, the enthusiastic chairman of the com- 
mittee upon this subject, has obtained upward 
of seventy papers from specialists in all parts 
of the world, and has secured the attendance 
of some of the most distinguished among Euro- 
pean folk-lorists, including M. Charles Ploix, 
President of the French Society ; Mr. J. Aber- 
crombie, Vice-President of the English So- 
ciety ; Herr Ulrich Jahn, of the Berlin Society ; 
and Mr. Smigrodski, of Warsaw, who comes 
as the representative of several Continental 
societies. One feature of the Folk-Lore Con- 
gress will be of extraordinary interest. On 
Friday evening a concert will be given for the 
purpose of illustrating the popular songs of 
the various races of mankind. This concert is 
made possible by the presence at the Exposi- 
tion of many types of humanity, and a score 
or more of nationalities will be represented in 
the programme. No single event of the week 
is likely to attract wider attention or excite 
more general interest. 

The Congress of Authors, in which our read- 
ers probably take a more general interest than 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



in any other, promises to be remarkably suc- 
cessful. The local committee of arrangements, 
having Mr. F. F. Browne as chairman, some 
time ago enlisted the services of an Eastern 
committee of the best-known American writers, 
with Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes as honorary 
chairman, and Professor George E. Woodberry 
as secretary. Largely owing to the efforts of 
this Committee of Cooperation, a very import- 
ant programme has been drawn up, dealing with 
the commercial as well as the artistic aspects 
of authorship. The former of these aspects 
will be presented very forcibly by Mr. Walter 
Besant, who comes as the representative of the 
English Society of Authors, and who has awak- 
ened in his fellow-countrymen much interest in 
the Chicago Congress. Mr. Besant comes not 
only to speak in his own person, but also as 
the bearer of many important papers by En- 
glish writers, among which may be mentioned 
" Some Considerations on Publishing," by Sir 
Frederick Pollock ; " The Berne Conference," 
by Sir Henry Bergne ; " Literature and the 
Press," by Mr. H. D. Traill ; and The Future 
of the Drama," by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones. 
A fact of extraordinary interest in connection 
with this Congress is the expected presence of 
the greatest poet of modern Italy, Signor Car- 
ducci, although it is not yet known what part 
he will take in the proceedings. The subject 
of Copyright will have an important place in 
the work of the Congress, being discussed not 
only in the papers sent by English contribu- 
tors, but also by Mr. A. L. Spofford, Libra- 
rian of Congress (who will preside), by Mr. R. 
R. Bowker of New York, and Mr. George E. 
Adams of Chicago. On the subject of Criti- 
cism, papers will be read by Messrs. Charles 
Dudley Warner (who will preside), John Bur- 
roughs, Moses Coit Tyler, H. W. Mabie, and 
others. On the subject of Fiction, there will be 
papers presented by Messrs. G. W. Cable (who 
will preside), Thomas Nelson Page, Joseph 
Kirkland, Mrs. Mary H. Catherwood, and Miss 
Alice French. Mr. R. W. Gilder, Mr. George 
E. Woodberry, and many other American writ- 
ers of distinction are also expected to be pres- 
ent at the Congress, and take part in the work ; 
but it is impossible at this date to give a more 
detailed account of the programme. Enough 
has been said, however, to make it clear that 
the gathering will be of great interest to all 
literary workers, and that important practical 
results may very probably remain as its out- 
come. The week of the Literature Congresses, 
taken as a whole, may be seen, even from the 



outline of facts presented in this article, to- 
promise a degree of attractiveness to all sorts 
of intellectual interests that is rarely offered 
the public at any one time and place. After 
the Congresses are over, THE DIAL will again 
take occasion to summarize their features, and 
to point out what shall appear to have been 
significant in the results achieved by them. 



CHRONICLE AND COMMENT. 

The Come'die Francaise could not come to Chi- 
cago this summer, for reasons playfully set forth in 
a recent article by M. Sarcey, and it has, instead, 
gone to London, where it is to remain a month, and 
produce no less than forty-seven pieces of its reper- 
tory. The programme includes classical and mod- 
ern plays in great variety, among which " Hamlet " 
is noteworthy, although we hardly recognize the 
tragedy in the description u drame en vers en 
cinq actes par MM. Dumas et Paul Meurice." But 
we have no doubt that it is our own Hamlet that 
M. Mounet-Sully will present to his audience. We 
must remember that it was Shakespeare's Cleopatra 
that was, after all, given us by Mme. Bernhardt, 
although disguised in lines that made no pretence 
of being Shakespearian. The opening performance 
of the French Play in London was signalized by a 
" Salut a Londres," written by M. Claretie, and re- 
cited by Mile. Reichemberg, from which we extract 
a few verses : 

"Salut, pays du grand Shakespeare, 

Au nom de Corneille le Grand ; 
Aux souverains d'un double empire 

Ou le g&iie accepte et rend ; 

" Ou, loin de la dent des couleuvres, 
II proclarae invincible et fier 
Le libre e'change des chefs-d'oeuvre 
A travers les vents et la mer ! " 

Mr. Edgar Prestage writes to the London " Acad- 
emy " to complain of the neglect of Portugese lit- 
erature by English students. To say that Portugal 
has produced but one author of the first rank 
Camoens is a statement as absurd, in his opinion, 
as " that England has produced no great poet with 
the exception of Shakespeare." He calls particu- 
lar attention to three great writers of the present 
century Almeida Garrett, Anthero de Quental, 
and Joao de Deus saying of the latter that he is 
" without doubt, the greatest lyric poet now living." 
Curiosity should certainly be stimulated by so en- 
thusiastic a description of a poet whose name means 
nothing at all to most English readers, but we 
fear that the case is a hopeless one. If the poet in 
question were a novelist, or even a dramatist, he 
might come into general recognition ; but no lyric 
poet is ever appreciated outside the circle of those 
whose language he sings. Heine has come nearer 
than any other lyrist of the century to such general 
favor, but even Heine is known to most non-Ger- 
mans chiefly for his humorous and ironical prose

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



or for his pathetic life-story. It was not Byron's 
slender lyrical gift that made him a Continental 
favorite, but the fact that he stood as an energetic 
and picturesque spokesman of the revolutionary 
spirit. Even Shelley is practically unknown out- 
side of England and America. The greatest of 
living lyrists pace Mr. Prestage is probably Sig- 
nor Carducci ; but to how many who are not Ital- 
ians is he more than a name ? Hugo's highest 
achievement was in the lyric, but to the English- 
speaking world he was the novelist and hardly 
more. These statements apply with almost equal 
force to Herr Bjornson ; but who, unfamiliar with 
Norwegian, thinks of Bjornson as a lyric poet ? 
There is no help for it. We can translate novels, 
and plays, and epics ; we cannot translate songs. 
A nation must be content with its own lyrists ; the 
genius of the singer proper is, by no process known 
to the alchemy of the translator, reproducible in 
another form of speech than that in which it finds 
native expression. 

The London " Literary World " recounts an al- 
leged recent " experience " of Mr. Herbert Spencer, 
telling us that the philosopher has " received a let- 
ter from a Wild West American publisher, asking 
how much he would take for the exclusive right to 
publish his poem, ' The Faerie Queen,' in the States." 
The story is not even ben trovato, but it shows well 
enough how we are libelled at times by the arro- 
gant foreigner. In this case, revenge follows 
promptly, for the same issue of the paper, a few 
pages further on, informs its readers that Mrs. 
Deland is a daughter of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe ; 
and, still later, inserts an anxious query as to the 
authorship of the line, 

" From perilous seas in faery lands forlorn." 
People who live in glass houses should not pretend 
that the brown-stone fronts of their neighbors are 
constructed of the same brittle material. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

PERHAPS AN ERROR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The frequent letters of " F. H." to " The Nation " 
are read with great interest and valued very highly, I 
am sure, by all American students of modern English. 
Nevertheless, there is something in these letters (if it 
may be said) that would be pleasanter if it were dif- 
ferent. A reader of a half-dozen of them cannot help 
wondering whether F. H." has ever made a mistake, 
the master is so masterful, his censure is so pungent. 

The grammatical question examined below is trivial, 
perhaps, but the examination itself becomes important 
if it be regarded as helping somewhat towards answer- 
ing the more serious inquiry, Has " F. H." ever erred ? 

It should be premised that " F. H." has identified 
himself in " The Nation " (more than once, I think) as 
the author of Modern English," and that there cannot 
be any impropriety, therefore, in referring to him here as 
the author of that well-knowu and very valuable work. 



The present case is this : At page 85 of his " Modern 
English " Dr. Hall quotes from Marsh's " Lectures on 
the English Language," and in one of the sentences 
quoted inserts sic in brackets after known to. This is 
the sentence quoted from Marsh's Lectures: 

" The word respect, in this combination, has none of the 
meanings known to [sic] it, as an independent noun, in the 
English vocabulary." 

Dr. Hall says of this sic in a foot-note: 
"A Lord Grenville of former days wrote of 'a long and 
destructive warfare, of a nature long since unknown to the 
practice of civilized nations.' Here, remarks Coleridge, ' the 
word to is absurdly used for the word in.' ( ' Essays on His 
own Times,' p. 262.) Not unlike the nobleman's ' unknown 
Jo,' the context considered, is Mr. Marsh's ' known to." 1 " 
("Modern English," p. 85.) 

Dr. Hall's sic and foot-note seem to show that he re- 
gards such uses of known to and unknown to as lacking 
authority and censurable. 

It may be assumed here that Dr. Hall does not find 
anything objectionable in a use of known to that occurs 
often in his own writings, as in the following instance: 
". . . the historical fact, known to everybody " ("Mod- 
ern English," p. 192, foot-note). Such use has been very 
common for a long time. But the same construction is 
common when the word with which known to or un- 
known to is connected has been substituted by me- 
tonymy for something else, as camp for people in the 
camp. 

" . . . in token of the which, 
My Noble Steed, knowne to the Campe, I give him." 
(" Coriolanus," Act I., sc. ix. ) 

"... custards, cheesecakes, and minced pies, which were 
entirely unknown to these parts. . . ." (Lady M.W. Mon- 
tagu, Letter, Nov. 27, N. S., 1753.) 

"Another accomplishment was that of copying manu- 
scripts, which they did with a perfection unknown to the 
scholastic age which followed them." (Cardinal Newman, 
"Historical Sketches," vol. ii., p. 464.) 

The line is not distinct between such cases and the fol- 
lowing: 

" In other cases it is not the love of finery, but simple want 
of education, which makes writers employ words in senses un- 
known to genuine English." ( J. S. Mill, " Logic," Bk. IV., 
ch. v., sect. 3.) 

" This is the only use of the word in Johnson, the following 
three being unknown to dictionaries till very recently." ( " A 
New English Dictionary on Historical Principles," Remark 
under Alternative. ) 

" Noble Tribunes, 

It is the humane way : the other course 
Will prove to[o] bloody : and the end of it, 
Unknowne to the Beginning." 

("Coriolanus," Act III., sc. i.) 

" Enoch's white horse, and Enoch's ocean spoil . . . 
Not only to the market-cross were known, 
But in the leafy lanes behind the down." 

(Tennyson, "Enoch Arden," 11, 93-7). 
"Most of these wretches were not soldiers. They acted 
under no authority known to the law." (Macaulay, "Hist. 
Eng.,"ch. xii.) 

A remark made by Dr. Hall concerning another locu- 
tion may be appropriately quoted here : " Even such a 
purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more than once." 
(" Modern English," p. 300.) 

The examples given above could be supported by a 
larger number of similar citations now before me, if 
there were space for printing so many.

THE DIAL 



IN KASHMIR AND WESTERN TIBET.* 

The handsome volume entitled " Where 
Three Empires Meet " contains the interesting 
account of Mr. E. F. Knight's recent trav- 
els in Kashmir, Western Tibit, Gilgit, and ad- 
joining countries ; the book taking its title 
from the fact that it is hard by Gilgit, on the 
high roof of the world, as it were, that the 
three greatest empires, Great Britain, Russia, 
and China, converge. Mr. Knight is a very 
agreeable writer, with a keen eye for out-of- 
the-way traits and humors ; and his book, be- 
sides being rich in the solider sort of facts, is 
pleasantly anecdotal, and, on occasion, drily 
humorous. Kashmir has been called the north- 
ern bastion of India, and Gilgit may be de- 
scribed as her farther outpost. Of the Happy 
Valley itself, the author did not, as he tells us, 
see much, the greater part of the year (1891) 
being spent by him among the desolate moun- 
tain-tracts to the north of it, where the ranges 
of the Hindoo Koosh and Karakoram form the 
boundary between the dominions of the Ma- 
haraja and that rather vaguely defined region 
called Central Asia. In the course of the 
journey he visited the mystic land of Ladak, 
and he reached Gilgit in time to take part 
in Colonel Durand's expedition against the 
raiding Hunza-Nagars, thus falling in with ex- 
ceptional opportunities for observing how 
things are ordered on the Indian frontier, both 
in peace and war. Mr. Knight prudently con- 
fines himself, so far as possible, to the narra- 
tive of his own sufficiently varied experiences, 
without attempting to theorize as to what ought 
to be done or left undone on the frontier. He 
remarks : 

" The Indian government can be trusted to do every- 
thing for the best, as heretofore ; and while it is foolish 
for people at home to airily criticise the policy of those 
highly-trained Anglo-Indian experts who have made 
the complicated problems of our Asiatic rule the study 
of a lifetime, it is still more foolish for one to do so 
who has spent but a year in the East, and who, there- 
fore, has just had time to realize what a vast amount 
he has yet to learn." 

Especially interesting and opportune is the 
account of Kashmir a sort of debatable land, 
at present, the affairs of which are likely soon 
to attract a good deal of attention. In order 
to understand the ground, at least the ostensi-

Travel in Kashmir, Western Tibet, Gilgit, and the Adjoin- 
ing Countries. By E. F. Knight. Illustrated. New York : 
Longmans, Green, & Co. 



ble ground, of late British interference in that 
country, a few general facts touching its more 
recent history must be borne in mind. Kash- 
mir, having been wrested from the Pathans by 
the Sikhs in 1819, was attached to the Pun- 
jab until the termination of the Sutlej cam- 
paign, when it fell into the hands of the Brit- 
ish who did not, as the author significantly 
observes, at that time realize its immense value. 
It was at once assigned by treaty, dated March 
16, 1846, to the Maharaja of Jummoo, partly 
in consideration of certain services rendered. 
In exchange for the cession the Maharaja was 
to pay over the very inadequate sum of seventy- 
five lacs of rupees, besides engaging to come 
to the assistance of England with the whole of 
his army whenever she was at war with any 
of the people near his frontier. He also ac- 
knowledged England's supremacy, and agreed 
to pay an annual tribute consisting mainly 
of Kashmir shawls to the government. By 
this treaty, not only the Vale of Kashmir, but 
Ladak, Baltistan, and the Astor and Gilgit 
districts, became the appanage of the Mahara- 
jas of Jummoo. During the reign of the 
present ruler, Pertab Singh, the Indian Gov- 
ernment has " lent " to the Kashmir State mil- 
itary and civil officers "to superintend the 
much-needed reforms in the administration of 
the country." The author describes what he 
saw of the work of these officials in a rather 
non-committal way, and he reaches the conclu- 
sion that the present active policy of Great Bri- 
tain in Kashmir, " while having for its object 
the safeguarding of our Imperial interests, will 
bring about a great amelioration in the condi- 
tion of the population." Despite this need of 
foreign interference in its internal affairs, Mr. 
Knight found Kashmir the " safest land he had 
ever seen or heard of " one of the few coun- 
tries, indeed, in which it is possible for a lady 
to travel without escort in a perfectly uncon- 
ventional way. 

" Every summer English ladies wander about Kash- 
mir alone, taking their caravans of native servants, bag- 
gage animals, and coolies, pitching their tents at night, 
and riding the stages in the same independent fashion 
as their brothers and husbands would." 

This immunity of travellers from offences 
against person or property seems to be due 
partly to the native dread of the dominant 
British race, partly to the drastic Oriental cus- 
tom by which a whole district is made amen- 
able for crimes committed within its boun- 
daries. 

The account of Kashmir itself, its climate, 



10 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



natural resources, etc., is highly favorable. 
The whole of the state is practically independ- 
ent of rain, a fairly hard winter storing a suffi- 
ciency of snow on the mountain-tops, so that 
the gradual thaw of the summer, which keeps 
the irrigating canals constantly brimming, is 
all that is needed to insure a harvest. The 
famines in Kashmir have been caused, not by 
summer drought, but by a too mild winter, or 
by heavy rains in the hot season which have 
flooded the plains and drowned out the crops. 
The climate of this Asiatic paradise seems to 
be well adapted to Europeans, the few English 
children who have been born and brought up 
there being as strong and rosy-cheeked as if 
they had been bred at home. The great draw- 
back to an Indian career, the necessary sepa- 
ration between parents and children, is thus 
quite avoidable in Kashmir ; and Mr. Knight 
regretfully observes, " Had we not sold this 
magnificent country, a great military canton- 
ment would no doubt have been long since es- 
tablished here." 

The resources of Kashmir have never been 
exploited, though Mr. Knight makes it evident 
that should British capital ever be admitted 
into the country there will be ample scope for 
it. According to some authorities, only one- 
third of the available land is under cultivation, 
and even that does not produce nearly what it 
might. Valuable minerals undoubtedly exist, 
and it is probable that should the long-pro- 
jected more-than-once-surveyed railway be 
made, Kashmir will become a large exporter 
of agricultural produce and of the delicious 
fruits for which it is famed. At present the 
industrial enterprise of the country is centred, 
that is to say is strangled, in the hands of 
the Maharaja. His, for instance, are the saw- 
mills, his the wine and brandy monopoly. 
French experts conduct the latter branch for 
him, producing wine, both red and white, of 
excellent quality ; and our author thinks it is 
not too much to say that the vineyards of 
Kashmir should some day make India inde- 
pendent of France, at least for claret of the 
ordinary description. 

In point of scenery and natural charm Kash- 
mir seems to be all that the author of " Lalla 
Rookh " (which poem our author makes it a 
point of honor not to quote) has taught the 
northern fancy to paint her. It is a land of 
running water, of fruits and flowers and birds 
(not omitting, one hopes, the bulbul, though 
Mr. Knight does not mention it), and sweet 
odors and sparkling cascades, a land, in 



short, that assures the traveller that the beau- 
ties of far-famed Kashmir have not been exag- 
gerated by Oriental poets. Mr. Knight who 
is a capital hand at description, terse, vigor- 
ous, and sparing of the finical details of the 
" word-painter " writes as follows of the scen- 
ery along the road to Baramoula : 

" We drove through pleasant groves of chestnuts, 
walnuts, peaches, pears, cherries, mulberries, and ap- 
ples, all of which are indigenous to this favored land, 
while the wild vines hung in festoons from the branches. 
The fresh grass beneath the trees was spangled with 
various flowers great terra-cotta colored lilies, iris of 
several shades, and others while hawthorn bushes in 
full blossom'emulated the whiteness of the snows above. 
The mountains, too, were craggy and grander in out- 
line than any we had yet seen. Highest of all were 
the dreary, snow-streaked wastes, lower down forests 
of deodar crowned the cliffs, which in their turn often 
fell sheer a thousand feet to the green, lawn-like ex- 
pauses below." 

The nominal masters of this favored land 
seem to be utterly unworthy of their good for- 
tune, as a rule, says our author. An English- 
man coming to the country for the first time 
takes a great fancy to the handsome, cheery, 
outwardly civil and obliging Kashmiris, and it 
is not until he has been some time in the coun- 
try that he discovers them to be among the 
most despicable of creatures, incorrigible cheats 
and liars, and cowardly to an inconceivable de- 
gree. Tartars, Tibetans, Moguls, Afghans, 
Sikhs, have in turn overrun the Happy Val- 
ley, whose inhabitants have always meekly sub- 
mitted to each new tyranny, their very abject- 
ness proving their salvation. Says Mr. Knight : 

" I had been a good deal among Mohammedans in 
other countries, and had always associated dignity and 
courage with the profession of that creed, so was dis- 
agreeably surprised to discover this cowardly, cringing, 
cackling race among the followers of the prophet." 

A Kashmiri will unresistingly take a blow from 
anyone, even from a Kashmiri ; the people 
who, however, wrangle among themselves like 
the proverbial washerwomen having achieved 
such a depth of cowardice that they actually 
fear one another. To understand the Kash- 
miri thoroughly, which is to dislike him, 
one must have seen, for instance, a great bearded 
man meekly submitting to having his ears 
boxed by a Punjabi half his size, whom he 
could crush with one hand, weeping and shriek- 
ing like a naughty child under the maternal 
slipper, " and finally rolling on the ground and 
howling at the feet of this lad of a more plucky 
race." On the other hand, "one must have 
observed his covert insolence to some griffin 
globe-trotter, who does not understand the ras-

cal yet, and treats him too leniently. He will 
presume on any kindness that is shown him, 
until, at last, going too far, he is brought to 
reason by the thrashing he has long been ask- 
ing for." In short, the inhabitant of the 
Happy Valley is a paradoxical creature, for he 
has, withal, certain rather feebly revealed good 
qualities, difficult to describe, and certainly 
not admirable, save, perhaps, to that school 
which affects to despise physical courage as a 
relic of savagery. 

The qualities of the serpent are often cou- 
pled with those of the dove ; and the Kash- 
miris, meekest of men, are uncommonly sly at 
a bargain, and are gifted, moreover, with a 
mercantile pertinacity not unworthy of the 
" book-agent " of less favored climes. Some 
of these Kashmir merchants will go to great 
lengths, stepping unbidden from the shore to 
the prow of the tourist's " doongah," crowd- 
ing into his cabin, pressing their wares upon 
him, and declining to move until forcibly 
ejected. To enjoy even a modicum of peace, 
the sahib must be brutal, and actual privacy is 
only to be gained with a stick. Any hint short 
of this is lost upon hawkers of the lower sort. 
A beating he understands as a hint that he 
must take himself off. Then he departs, smil- 
ing ; it is all in his day's work ; and to cheat 
the sahib out of one anna will recompense him 
for many blows. Our author says of the mer- 
chants of Srinagur an especially pestilent 
class : 

" They were all adepts at blarney, and with a jovial 
persuasive volubility extolled their own wares and cried 
down those of their neighbors in more or less broken 
English. Their pertinacity was extraordinary. The 
sweetly-smiling, long-robed ruffians would not take no 
for an answer. <I do not want you to buy, sir,' one 
would say in a gentle, deprecating way, after some em- 
phatic refusal on my part to have any dealings with 
him. ' Please to understand, sir, that I do not wish to 
sell. I only ask you to do me the honor of looking at 
some of this excellent workmanship. It will not fail to 
interest you.' Then, if I should order him to be gone, 
and explain that I was busy, ' In that case I would not 
on any account interrupt you,' he would urge, < but I 
have nothing myself to do, sir, so I will sit down here 
and wait until you are quite unoccupied; then I will 
show you some beautiful things.' And thereupon he 
would squat down on the grass in front of the boat, 
surrounded by his merchandise, to remain there silent 
and motionless, contemplating me with a smile of pa- 
tient amiability." 

These people employ all sorts of curious de- 
vices to attract the attention of the rich or 
powerful sahib a habit, however, by no means 
confined to the merchant class. Even learn- 
ing forgets, on occasion, its dignity. Once, 



for instance, in Srinagur, Mr. Lawrence, the 
Settlement Officer for the State, on coming 
out of his bungalow, found a strange object in 
front of his door, surrounded by a deferential 
crowd. On walking up to it he discovered 
that it was nothing less than an ancient pun- 
dit, stark naked, standing on his head. The 
acrobatic sage was thus patiently balancing him- 
self, meditating, doubtless, the while on Nir- 
vana, while he awaited the coming out of the 
sahib. Mr. Lawrence ordered the learned man 
to be turned right side up, and the case was 
dealt with forthwith. 

The following incident, of which Mr. Knight 
was an eye-witness, illustrates this curiously 
puerile side of the Kashmiri character. Mr. 
Lawrence was then holding court just outside 
Islamabad : 

" Two suppliants came up, who, after the manner of 
Kashmiris, had carefully got themselves up in pitiable 
plight with a view of attracting sympathy for their 
cause. These two big men had stripped themselves 
naked, and had smeared their bodies all over with foul, 
wet, blue mud from the river bed. Even their hair and 
faces were thickly covered with the filth, through which 
their eyes glittered comically. . . . They came up 
and stood before the Settlement Officer, quietly sa- 
laamed, and then suddenly and of one accord com- 
menced to weep, groan, and shriek most dismally, while 
they wrung their hands or clasped them imploringly, 
writhing their bodies as in agony, etc. . . . Their 
story was, that while they were working in their fields 
an official had taken from them by force some grass 
straw of the value of twopence. The said official had 
moreover plucked their beards; in evidence of which 
they produced two or three hairs, which they affirmed 
had been pulled out." 

Mr. Lawrence refused to listen to men in so 
filthy a condition, and the court accordingly 
adjourned itself and went to breakfast while 
the plaintiffs washed themselves. 

The Kashmiri, with all his rascality, always 
demands, on leaving his employer, a chit, or 
written testimonial. If convicted of theft or 
other offence he will endure without a murmur 
the mulcting of his pay ; but a chit, good, bad, 
or indifferent, he must have. So insensible is 
he as to the purport of these talismans that he 
does not take the trouble to get them translated, 
but presents them all, good and bad, for your 
consideration. One official, encountered by 
Mr. Knight, was the proud possessor of many 

chits : 

" He handed one to me, and gazed at me with a sol- 
emn expression of conscious merit as I read it. This 
chit was from a captain sahib, and ran thus: 'This 
man is the greatest thief and scoundrel generally I have 
ever come across.' " 

On reaching Ladak, really a part of Tibet, 
Mr. Knight found himself in a strange country, 



12 



[July 1, 



a land, as he says, of topsy-turveydom, where 
polyandry prevails instead of polygamy, where 
praying is carried on by machinery, where the 
traveller from beyond the mountains is every 
day bewildered by quaint sights, strange beliefs, 
customs, and superstitions. Ladak is still almost 
as theocratic a country as Chinese Tibet, and no 
less than one-sixth of the population are in the 
church. The Church is well endowed, and the 
lamaseries, several of which were visited, seem 
to be organized in a very business-like way. 
There are two classes of monks in each : the 
working monks, who attend to temporal inter- 
ests, and the spiritual monks, who devote their 
time to dreaming and religious exercises, and 
to whom, our author thinks, "to judge from 
their abstracted expression and general ap- 
pearance, the bladder-flappers of the Laputan 
sages would be useful attendants, to wake 
them up when it was time to wash." From 
the latter class the abbot is chosen, and in 
a few cases a lamasery has as its spiritual 
head no less holy a personage than a skooshok, 
or incarnation. It seems that after a man 
has attained a high pitch of virtue, and has 
thus escaped liability to re-birth in any of 
the six ordinary spheres, he can when he dies 
either enter the Nirvana, or.*return to earth as 
a skooshok. The Skooshok of Spitak Gompa, 
for instance, a very exemplary personage in- 
deed, is believed to have been re-incarnated 
seventeen times, and to have been, in his first 
stage, a contemorary of Buddha. One of these 
holy men, the Skooshok of Tikzay, was visited 
by Mr. Knight : 

" He appeared to be a man of middle age, and had a 
gentle, intelligent face. He spoke but little, and had 
a dreamy, far-off look in his eyes. For most of the 
time that we sat with him he was abstractedly gazing 
at the immense landscape that was extended before 
him deserts, oases, the far-stretching Indus Valley, 
and the snowy mountain-ranges. . . . His incarna- 
tions have been many. He thoroughly believes that he 
was Skooshok of Tikzay at a date when we British 
were naked, painted savages, and has been gazing cen- 
tury after century over the same glaring wilderness 
from this high monastery top. At times he muttered 
prayers almost inaudibly as he sat by us, contemplating 
the scene with mild, sad eyes. He ordered a gift of 
sugar and dried apricots to be brought to us, and then 
we bade farewell to the incarnation, whom we left still 
praying and dreamily considering the world below." 

Oddly enough, one never hears of Mahatmas 
in Ladak or in Tibet proper. The lamas know 
nothing of them, and the nearest approach to 
the mysterious beings seems to be the skoo- 
shok though the author doubts whether a 
European esoteric Buddhist would accept one 
of these incarnations as his spiritual master. 



Mr. Knight, like other travellers, notes the 
striking resemblance between the ritual of Ti- 
betan Buddhism and that of the Church of 
Rome: 

" The lamas, who represented the saints in this mum- 
mery, had the appearance of early-Christian bishops: 
they wore mitres and copes, and carried pastoral crooks; 
they swung censers of incense as they walked in pro- 
cession, slowly chanting. Little bells were rung at in- 
tervals during the ceremony ; some of the chanting was 
quite Gregorian. There was the partaking of a sort of 
sacrament; there was a dipping of fingers in bowls of 
holy water; the shaven monks, who were looking on, 
clad almost exactly like some of the friars in Italy, told 
their beads on their rosaries," etc. 

Several of the best chapters are devoted to 
a description of the Hunza-Nagar expedition 
of winter before last one of those innumera- 
ble little broils which England has had on 
her hands of late. Mr. Knight volunteered 
as an officer, thus securing excellent opportuni- 
ties of observation. The book is, on the whole, 
one of the most graphic and entertaining of its 
class, delightfully written, and full of informa- 
tion regarding a region well out of the orbit of 
the ordinary globe-trotter. There are a number 
of capital illustrations from photographs by the 
author.

THE WORKS AND WORK OF FRANCIS 
GALTON.* 



Two remarkable books have just appeared 
by Mr. Galton. " Hereditary Genius " was 
published in 1869, but has for years been out 
of print. Mr. Galton has written a new pref- 
ace for it, and reprinted it otherwise as it first 
appeared. " Finger-Prints " is entirely new, 
and embodies the author's latest study along 
a novel line. Between 1869 and 1892, between 
the publication of " Hereditary Genius " and 
"Finger-Prints," three other notable works by 
the same author were published : " English 
Men of Science," " Inquiries into Human Fac- 
ulty," and " Natural Inheritance." There are 
perhaps not five such original books in the lan- 
guage ; certainly there are few scientific works 
in any language that are dictated by so honest 
a purpose. Mr. Galton is now a man of sev- 
enty, and it may not be uninteresting to review 
here his scientific work. 

Two subjects perhaps have attracted his par- 
ticular attention, Heredity and Identification. 
The former is dealt with in all his books, the 
latter in "Finger-Prints." Everywhere Mr.

Galton is an anthropologist and a statistician. 
He reduces his results, wherever practicable, 
to mathematical form and statement. In " He- 
reditary Genius " he assumes that high repu- 
tation is a fairly accurate test of high ability 
(= genius). From this assumption he proceeds 
to study certain groups of eminent men. He 
considers first the judges of England from 
1660 to 1868, and carefully examines into the 
family histories to ascertain how many and 
what eminent relatives they had. Similar 
studies are made of the statesmen of the time 
of George the Third, of the Premiers of the 
last hundred years, of men of literature, scien- 
tists, painters, musicians, divines, and scholars. 
Lastly, some data from oarsmen and wrestlers 
are presented. In each series it is shown that 
there are more eminent relatives in the families 
of given men of talent than mathematical prob- 
abilities require. Some few quotations or con- 
clusions may be interesting some of them im- 
portant in the discussion, some merely inci- 
dental. 

Talent, it seems, is dreadfully rare ; medi- 
ocrity is painfully common. Out of any mil- 
lion of Englishmen over fifty years old only 
about two hundred and fifty are really eminent. 

" Ability, in the long run, does not start suddenly 
into existence and disappear with equal abruptness, but 
rather it rises in a gradual and regular curve out of 
the ordinary level of family life. The statistics show 
that there is a regular average increase of ability in 
the generations that precede its culmination and as reg- 
ular a decrease in those which succeed it. In the first 
case the marriages have been consentient to its produc- 
tion ; in the latter they have been incapable of preserv- 
ing it." 

One of the best tables in the work is the one 
giving the facts regarding statesmen. These 
are generally eminently gifted, and their rela- 
tionships are rich in ability. Nor is the abil- 
ity distributed at haphazard : it clearly affects 
certain families. Moreover, the peculiar com- 
bination of gifts that make up a good states- 
man high intellectual power, tact in deal- 
ing with men, power of expression in debate, 
ability to endure exceedingly hard work is 
hereditary. 

Incidentally, Mr. Galton makes some sug- 
gestive statements regarding the cause of peer- 
ages dying out, why very pious parents may have 
wicked children, and how the church has hin- 
dered man's progress. Men of ability who are 
raised to peerages are prone to marry heiresses ; 
or, if they do not do so themselves, their sous 
do. But the heiress only child in a family 
comes from an infertile stock, and is little 



likely to be herself the mother of a vigorous 
family. Pious persons, according to Mr. Gal- 
ton, are naturally endowed with high moral 
characters combined with instability of disposi- 
tion, peculiarities in no way connected. The 
child may inherit both, or he may inherit one 
without the other ; in neither of the latter 
cases will he be markedly pious, in one he 
may be truly bad. Mr. Galton claims that the 
policy of the church during the middle ages, 
in enforcing or encouraging celibacy in the best 
men and women of the time, placed a premium 
upon mediocrity. 

Our author believes that the chance for emi- 
nence in the relationship of an eminent man 
varies with the degree of kin. He says : 

" I reckon the chances of kinsmen of illustrious men 
rising or having risen to eminence to be fifteen and one- 
half to one hundred in case of fathers, thirteen and one- 
half to one hundred in the case of brothers, twenty-four to 
one hundred in the case of sons. Or, putting these and the 
remaining proportions in a more convenient way, we 
obtain the following results : In the first grade, the 
chance of the father is one to six; of each brother, one 
to seven ; of each son, one to four. In the second 
grade, of each grandfather, one to twenty-five; of each 
uncle, one to forty; of each nephew, one to forty; of 
each grandson, one to twenty-nine. In the third grade 
the chance of each brother is about one to two hundred, 
except in case of first cousins, where it is one to one 
hundred." 

Nor are different races equally gifted with 
ability. Mr. Galton considers the Negro race 
two grades in his scale of ability below the En- 
glish. But he believes that we are surpassed 
by the Athenians at their prime by at least an 
equal amount. This claim may be true, but it 
is not palatable. In this discussion the author 
strikes the key-note of his work, the underly- 
ing idea of all his study. He believes that we 
ought to raise the grade of ability of our race, 
that we should breed a nobler posterity. Ear- 
lier marriage of the capable is the only way for 
the intellectually and morally fit to survive. 
This practical application of the results of his 
apparently non-utilitarian and theoretical stud- 
ies is ever the most striking feature in Mr. 
Galton's writings. 

Passing by his " English Men of Science " 
and " Investigations into Human Faculty," al- 
though both are interesting and characteristic, 
we will consider " Natural Inheritance " the 
most mathematical of the series. To discover 
the parental influence upon the offspring, he 
finds it necessary to get rid of sex, and trans- 
forms the female character of the mother into 
male equivalents ; he then combines the pa- 
rental influences, and, by averaging, secures an 



14 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



ideal mid-parent whose qualities are what are 
really inherited. He finds a constantly oper- 
ative law of regression toward mediocrity, and 
shows that gifts of high order are little likely 
to be transmitted fully. " The more bounti- 
fully a parent is gifted by nature, the more 
rare will be his good fortune if he begets a son 
who is as richly endowed as himself, and still 
more so if he has a son endowed still more 
largely." But the law is even-handed, and the 
son no more inherits all his father's wickedness 
and disease than he does his good points. In 
this study, the heredity of stature, eye, color, 
artistic taste, disease, and the matter of latent 
characters, are discussed. The material used 
is interesting. What was needed was the facts 
regarding several succeeding generations, each 
containing a considerable number of individ- 
uals equally related to each other (fraternities, 
etc.) ; groups, not individuals. Mr. Galton 
offered a considerable sum in prizes for family 
records, which were used as the basis of these 
studies. Some material was also secured at 
his Anthropometric Laboratory. But human 
material, sufficient in quantity and precise in 
character, is very difficult to obtain ; and to 
secure fraternities of the desired size and rep- 
resentative of several generations, Mr. Galton 
directed careful cultures of sweet peas and 
" pedigree moths." He concludes that every 
individual receives from each parent one-fourth 
of his endowment and from each grandparent 
one-sixteenth. As a final conclusion, he says : 
" Suppose two couples, one consisting of two 
gifted members of a poor stock and the other 
of two ordinary members of a gifted stock. 
The difference between them will display itself 
in their offspring. The children of the former 
will tend to regress ; those of the latter will 
not." Here again we see his plan for amelio- 
ration. 

We have referred above to Mr. Galton's 
Anthropometric Laboratory. It is known to 
most visitors to the South Kensington Museum. 
In it anyone may be thoroughly examined and 
measured free of charge ; a permanent record is 
made of his measurements and faculties, and a 
copy is given to him for his own use. For use in 
this Laboratory, Mr. Galton has devised some 
most ingenious pieces of apparatus for the study 
of delicacy in hearing, quickness of blow, keen- 
ness of eyesight, etc. In devising such instru- 
ments and pieces of apparatus for clearly illus- 
trating points of considerable mathematical 
complexity, Mr. Galton is a veritable genius. 
He is also the inventor of composite photog- 



raphy, which has been used in so many ways 
in science. For some years past those who 
were measured in the Laboratory have left the 
impression of their finger-tips behind them, 
and a study of this material has led to his last 
book, " Finger-Prints." 

As in all his writing, Mr. Galton presents 
first a summary of the treatment to be pur- 
sued in the book. Finger-prints have been 
used among various peoples in signing legal 
papers, but have seldom been used for purposes 
of identification. Sir William Herschel made 
such use of them in India. A full statement 
of the methods of taking finger-prints, of en- 
larging them, and of study, are then given. 
Anyone who will look at his own finger-tips 
will see that they are covered with curved 
ridges surrounding a central core ; this core 
may be either an arch, a loop, or a whorl. 
Taking into consideration the ridges above and 
below these cores, and the cores themselves, 
some nine fundamental patterns may be made 
out. These may serve as a basis for classifica- 
tion. In any given pattern there are also minor 
details which characterize it. But confining 
attention to only the more important points, 
one may easily and exactly describe any given 
combination. Mr. Galton thinks that he finds, 
from careful study of a considerable number of 
cases, that the patterns are persistent from 
birth to death. If this is so, and it is likely 
that finger-prints of two persons are never 
identical, we have here, of course, an import- 
ant means for identification. After finding 
how many points of comparison are presented 
in a single finger-print, Mr. Galton calculates 
the mathematical probability of any two per- 
sons having the print made by any single fin- 
ger identical, at 1 : 2 s6 , or 1 to 6400 millions. 
" It is a smaller chance than 1 to 4 that the 
print of any single finger of any given person 
would be exactly like that of the same finger 
of any other member of the human race." 
What would the probability of identity be if all 
ten finger-prints of one man were compared with 
all ten of those of another ? Everyone knows 
how important a rapid, simple, and certain 
means of identification is to-day. Bertillon's 
method of measurement met the demand so 
well that it has rapidly been adopted in re- 
formatories arid prisons, but it is by no means 
certain. It is true that a man who can make 
Bertillon's measurements is more readily found 
than one who can compare finger-prints ; but 
two minutes' time would add a card of finger- 
prints to the anthropometric data secured in 



1893.]

Bertillonage, and the combined data would 
make identification absolutely sure. Mr. Gal- 
ton, after considering the identification value 
of finger-prints, makes some study of the he- 
redity of patterns, which he believes to exist ; 
he finds considerable resemblances also be- 
tween twins. His study of finger-prints of dif- 
ferent races is not very extensive ; but he has 
studied some material from Welsh, Hebrew, 
Negro, and Basque sources. From this he con- 
cludes that there are no ethnic peculiarities. It 
seems to us, however, that such a conclusion is 
premature. 

Such, in brief, is Mr. Galton's work, remark- 
able alike for its originality, its practical im- 
portance, and its scientific value. 

FREDERICK STARR. 



THE HOMERIC QUESTION ONCE MOKE.* 

Did Homer write the " Iliad," or was it an- 
other man of the same name ? This question, 
as Matthew Arnold tells us, with his character- 
istic impatience of laborious futility, has been 
discussed with learning, with ingenuity, with 
genius even ; but it has the inconvenience that 
there really exist no data for determining it. 
And yet. unmindful of Seneca's warning that 
life is too short to debate the authorship of 
the " Iliad " and " Odyssey," Mr. Andrew 
Lang, master in the art of evading vain logo- 
machy with an epigram, now inflicts upon a 
book-ridden world four hundred pages of su- 
pererogatory demonstration that the German 
higher criticism of Homer is naught. Is he 
preparing a volume to disprove the Baconian 
authorship of the plays of Shakespeare ? 

As a student, I perused two or three thou- 
sand pages of erudite German and Latin treat- 
ises in order to earn the right to enjoy my 
Homer in peace. But I date from two mem- 
orable conversations the final illuminating 
and restful conviction that the Homeric ques- 
tion should be relegated to the large leisure of 
Milton's fallen angels, along with the free-will 
controversy, the problem of the nature and ori- 
gin of the Roman gens, and the determination 
of the dates of the Platonic dialogues. I was 
once talking with a well-known German Ho- 
merid about certain favorite passages in the 
closing books of the " Iliad," the lament of 
Briseis over the body of Patroclus, and the 
threnodies of Andromache and Helen for Hec- 

* HOMER AND THE EPIC. By Andrew Lang, M.A. New 
York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



tor. These passages my interlocutor had pro- 
nounced late interpolations ; and, half in jest, 
I expressed my regret at the sacrifice of this 
exquisite poetry on the altar of science. " Yes," 
he gravely replied, " they are not by Homer, 
but were all composed by one interpolator who 
had a special talent for dirges." The other 
conversation was an argument with an Ameri- 
can colleague, a distinguished professor of com- 
parative philology. Our debate terminated in 
the " mere oppugnancy " of assertion and coun- 
ter-assertion. It was to him axiomatic that no 
early Greek poet could have employed for va- 
riety or metri causa any dialectic form not 
familiar to his infancy in his native isle or can- 
ton. And he also stoutly maintained that 
there was an irreconcilable contradiction be- 
tween the last line of the first Iliad, in which 
Zeus and all the Gods go to bed (or to sleep), 
and the first lines of the second book, in which 
" the other gods slumbered all night, but sweet 
sleep did not hold Zeus." Neither of these 
affirmations would " shine in on me," as the 
Germans say, and the debate ceased from want 
of common standing-ground of principles. 

Now Mr. Lang's book is a prolonged printed 
conversation of this type with the German 
Homerids, and with his friend Mr. Walter 
Leaf, who has wasted much good paper on 
these themes in his otherwise excellent edition 
of the " Iliad," and in his recently-published 
" Companion to the Iliad," which would be 
much more companionable if it were not stuffed 
with this unsatisfying sawdust. In his intro- 
ductory chapters, Mr. Lang retells the thrice- 
told tale of the Homeric controversy from the 
days of Wolf, summarizing and refuting point 
by point Wolf's famous but much overrated 
" Prolegomena." He then analyzes in detail 
the story of the " Iliad " and the " Odyssey," 
smoothing over the hitches in the plot detected 
by exigent German exegesis, and defending 
the more important of the passages that have 
been stigmatized as interpolations. It is a 
wearisome business, as Mr. Lang says, to undo 
the " knots in the bulrush " which this petti- 
fogging criticism is perpetually discovering. A 
few specimens must suffice. Herr Fick, for ex- 
ample, rejects the fight over the body of Pa- 
troclus because the prologue explicitly declares 
that the wrath of Achilles gave the bodies of 
heroes to the dogs and the birds. As if there 
were nothing in " Paradise Lost " that the 
heavenly muse is not bidden to sing in the 
prologue ! Diomede, when confronted with 
the unknown Glaucus in the sixth book of the

" Iliad," declines the combat until he can be 
assured that his opponent is not a god in dis- 
guise. " Flat burglary as ever was committed," 
cry our learned Dogberrys. For has not Dio- 
mede just wounded Aphrodite and struck down 
Ares in the fifth book? But Diomede had 
been expressly warned by Athena to confine 
his attacks to Ares and Aphrodite, and the 
power of " discerning god from man " was of 
course not a permanent endowment, but was 
bestowed upon him for that occasion. 

Again, the petitionary embassy of the Greeks 
to Achilles in the ninth book is thought to be 
irreconcilable with Achilles' scornful or doubt- 
ful references in later books to the possibility 
or probability of such an appeal to his pity. 
But in repeated readings of these books in the 
class-room, I have never known a student to 
stumble at this supposed stone of offense. And, 
indeed, it does not require much insight into 
the logic of passion to see that an angry man 
may well spurn profferred atonement to-day, and 
yet cry out exultingly when he sees his enemy 
reduced to still more grievous straits on the 
morrow. " Now methinks that the sons of the 
Achaeans will stand in prayer about my knees, 
for intolerable need is come upon them." 

Mr. Lang makes much use of Matthew Ar- 
nold's argument of the improbability of the ex- 
istence of four or five nearly contemporaneous 
great poets, all working in the " grand style." 
One is pleased to note that he repudiates Pro- 
fessor Jebb's suggestion that what the great 
critic took for the grand style was merely the 
traditional epic diction, an assumption suffi- 
ciently refuted by Arnold's discriminating re- 
marks on Quintus of Smyrna. Mr. Lang also 
points out that Thackeray and Scott, in the 
days of proof-readers, could not attain to any- 
thing approaching the unfailing accuracy de- 
manded by Homeric critics ; he affirms that 
the lapses and nods of Homer are not dis- 
cernible to the unmicroscopic eye, and that they 
never disturb any readers except "spectacled 
young Germans on their promotion "; he shows 
that philosophic consistency is not to be looked 
for in scenes where the gods play a part, 
" mythology being consistent only in inconsis- 
tency " ; and then, growing weary of the con- 
troversy, petulantly protests that it is idle to 
argue with men who, to prove that a certain 
idea is unhomeric, expunge all passages in 
which it occurs. And yet he still persists in 
arguing, and grows too angry to be always 
amusing : " A critic who can seriously advance 
such a theory simply proves that he is incapa- 



ble of understanding what poetry is." " It is 
possible to give people poetry, but impossible 
to give them the brains to understand and the 
hearts to feel it." Is there not a slight failure 
here in the urbanity that we look for in the 
writer of " Letters to Dead Authors " ? We 
should bear in mind the provocation, however. 
For it appears from the chapters on the " Odys- 
sey " that he has actually read Kirchhoff and 
Niese through, pen in hand. The nervous 
strain of such a task palliates, if it does not 
justify, the vivacity of Mr. Lang's irreverent 
treatment of an argument contributed to the 
discussion by an estimable scholar who is 
thought in Germany to combine literary grace 
with scientific thoroughness, Wilamowitz-Moel- 
lendorf : " Telemachus ( Ody. 1, ^7-?) sits down 
in his bed and takes off his chiton. But the 
chiton reached to his feet. How then could 
he take it off when sitting down ? The critic 
can try the experiment with his night-shirt : 
he will be far from ingenious if he does not 
solve the problem." 

More attractive than these polemics are the 
archaeological and literary chapters at the end 
of Mr. Lang's volume. What is the relation 
of the Mycenae finds to the art described in 
Homer? Closer study reveals that the two 
arts are not identical, as was incautiously as- 
sumed at first. How shall we date the art of 
Mycenae by Egyptian or by Assyrian analo- 
gies ? Examples of Mycenaen art have been 
found in Egyptian tombs of the sixteenth cen- 
tury B. C., a date which startles the most res- 
olute pre-Dorian. On the other hand, if we 
make the treasures of Mycenae rich in gold 
contemporaneous with the Assyrian art of the 
period from 800 to 600 B. C., we must assume 
that the later Greeks, while preserving the 
earlier Homeric tradition, had completely for- 
gotten the mighty chiefs who so recently had 
reared the Lion's gate of Mycenae. Mr. Lang 
evidently doubts the possibility of attaining 
certainty with our present knowledge. Can 
we argue that Homer is later than carved gems 
because he never mentions them ? We could 
in the same way infer that Shakespeare is later 
than tobacco. Can we date pottery by the 
tomb in which it is found ? But ancient heir- 
looms may have been buried with the dead, or 
modern articles dropped or deposited by a des- 
ecrating or pious hand. Then, too, there is 
the malicious fact that " old Mexican pottery 
is often, in shape, color, and decoration, hardly 
to be distinguished from that of Mycenae 
or lalysus." It would be unbecoming for a

layman to dispute the dicta of professional 
archaeologists, but when these doctors disagree 
he may divert himself with the " rival plausi- 
bilities of archaeological argument." 

Finally, Mr. Lang's account of the " Nibel- 
ungen Lied," of the " Chanson de Roland," 
and of the " Kalevala," conveys much useful 
information in compact convenient form. He 
explodes the false analogies that have been al- 
leged between the composition of these poems 
and the supposed redaction of the " Iliad " by 
the commission of Pisistratus. And while he 
does full justice to the grandeur and pathos of 
certain episodes of the story of Brunhild, he 
never allows the reader to forget that " ' tis 
a pretty poem, but you must not call it Homer."

THE SOCIAL, SPIRIT ix AMERICA.* 

The growing interest in social problems 
throughout our country, both among scholars 
and the masses, is a hopeful and wholesome 
tendency to be welcomed and, fostered. There is 
here something more than a passing fashion or 
a mere literary pastime. Every intelligent and 
earnest mind recognizes that serious tasks of 
industrial reorganization are upon us. And 
this widespread consciousness of their existence, 
and the fertility in the invention of schemes 
for the bringing in of the millennium, are signs 
of promise that give us hope. 

Pauperism and crime are not new diseases, 
but the systematic effort to prevent and extir- 
pate these evils is a modern enterprise. The 
unjust distribution of wordly goods and the 
great miseries of the toiling masses, these 
have existed since the beginning of history ; 
but the encouraging fact is that they are now 
felt and fought as never before. The maga- 
zines overflow with discussions of the innumer- 
able phases of the social problem ; special or- 
gans spring into existence to lead attacks upon 
specific strongholds of the common enemy ; the 
daily press sends reports of new theories and 
philanthropic efforts abroad on the wings of 
the morning ; special organizations spread as 
by magic to relieve some peculiar distress or re- 
press some particular wrong ; these questions 
have come to the front in our Universities, and 
the pulpit begins to occupy itself with the 
topics and phases of social science. And all

this is well. It will make religion more hu- 
mane, more practical, and more catholic ; it 
will give us a literature of ethical power as 
well as of attractive beauty. Above all, it will 
regenerate human society by the intelligent ap- 
plication of remedial and educative agencies 
for the purification and enrichment of its cor- 
porate life. 

Two notable contributions to the discussion 
of these problems have recently been made 
by Mr. N. P. Oilman and the Rev. Washing- 
ton Gladden, the former in " Socialism and 
the American Spirit," and the latter in " Tools 
and the Man." The two books, though differ- 
ent in scope and method, have this much in 
common : they are both earnest in spirit, tem- 
perate in the discussion of the problems treated, 
and preeminently wholesome in their general 
teachings. Neither Mr. Oilman nor Mr. Olad- 
den is doctrinaire or fanatic, but both men are 
practical Americans, anxious to learn from the 
teachings of all experience, and yet deeply con- 
scious (Mr. Oilman more especially) that our 
social problems must be wrought out by inde- 
pendent thought working through methods de- 
signed to fit our peculiar conditions. Both 
men feel the tremendous sweep of the socialis- 
tic sentiment, and yet neither has parted com- 
pany with that common-sense which keeps close 
to reality and brings all theoretical schemes to 
the test of experience. These pages reveal a 
deep sympathy for the larger aims of social- 
ism, but neither author commits himself to any 
special socialistic programme, both being evolu- 
tionists rather than revolutionists. And here 
we have ample recognition of the moral aspects 
of industrial problems, with a clear realization 
that spiritual forces have a part to play in the 
ongoing and upbuilding of human society. 

Both these books seem to me to be preemi- 
nently sane and opportune, spurs to the apa- 
thetic and indifferent, and needed correctives 
of that merely sentimental treatment of social 
problems which has been so much in vogue re- 
cently in and about Boston. Mr. Oilman's is 
by far the more scientific, original, and import- 
ant treatise, with a stronger grip on the prob- 
lem of socialism and a clearer vision of what 
is possible and expedient. Scholars will find 
in it a positive contribution to the topics dis- 
cussed, and its words will do much to win men 
from flying socialistic kites to the slow but sure 
tasks of social amelioration. Mr. Gladden has 
made a little book that will stir many a com- 
placent business man to new thoughts respect- 
ing the rights of laborers and the proper uses

of his gains ; and it will do immense good by 
making thousands realize that Christianity, to 
be worth having, must be penetrated with the 
ethical passion and devoted to practical minis- 
tries of love. 

The purpose of Mr. Oilman is not to give a 
history of socialism, though he weaves the es- 
sential facts of its various movements into the 
texture of his discussion. He does not attempt 
to expound or refute its principles so much as 
to bring them into comparison with the Amer- 
can spirit, and in this indirect way he shows 
how far the spirit of socialism may be wel- 
comed and also how far the socialistic pro- 
gramme conflicts with what is most precious 
and fundamental in our institutions. The ear- 
lier chapters of his book contain a very clear 
and admirable discussion of the factors at work 
in American society, the part played by in- 
dividualism and the part played by corporate 
and governmental methods. These chapters 
may well be commended in the strongest terms 
as a most valuable statement of what consti- 
tutes our manifest destiny as a nation, as well 
as a summary of what is highest in American 
citizenship. 

The author shows how incompatible Ameri- 
can institutions are with the socialistic pro- 
gramme, and yet he constantly takes issue 
with Mr. Herbert Spencer, whom he criticises 
in a very forcible manner. Mr. Gilman, in 
his discussion of the functions of the State, fol- 
lows, it seems to me, the path of the golden 
mean : the government must be an opportunist, 
doing whatever is needed by the individual 
that the individual cannot well do for himself ; 
and yet the individual must be a living cell in 
a fluent organism rather than a cog in a mere 
machine. The two chapters on " The Indus- 
trial Future " and " The Way to Utopia " con- 
tain a large amount of clear thought and sober 
judgment which will do much to extend right 
views in these directions. From the author of 
" Profit Sharing " we naturally expect some- 
thing more than an allusion to this subject ; 
and we are not disappointed. 

This work will probably displease many per- 
sons, especially the disciples of Mr. Bellamy. 
Mr. Gilman holds "Looking Backward" up 
to the light, and shows without much trouble, 
but better than is done anywhere else, what a 
frail and gauzy fabric it really is. The severe 
critic could easily find some fault, here and 
there, with Mr. Oilman's pages, but I shall not 
attempt to criticise in detail or describe his 
work at greater length. I wish rather to com- 



mend it heartily as a very able discussion of 
the American spirit and the relation of social- 
ism to our institutions. Almost every page 
has words of wisdom which make the path of 
the American citizen a little plainer. 

Mr. Gladden has produced a very helpful 
book for the people who will constitute the ma- 
jority of his readers. He has not written for 
scholars or specialists ; but as in his former 
book, " Applied Christianity," he here tries to 
carry the authority of Christianity over into 
social affairs, while he also tries to interest 
Christians more fully in social problems. He 
endeavors to point out what changes the appli- 
cation of the Christian Law ought to make in 
the use of property, the holding of land ; upon 
industrial organizations, and upon competition 
in general. His pages stir us to enthusiasm for 
nobler policies in business, where his arguments 
seem inconclusive ; his earnestness imparts a 
moral fervor, where his theories sometimes fail 
to win the assent of reason. Everyone must 
join with him in the desire that love and jus- 
tice gain new power in the shop and on the 
market. But some of his statements, in their 
lack of scientific precision and in their inten- 
sity of expression, remind us that we are lis- 
tening to an oration from the pulpit rather 
than the calm deliverance of a specialist and a 
philosopher. Especially to be deplored is the 
loose and expansive way in which the term 
Christian is used. Mr. Gladden is constantly 
asking : What does Christian Ethics demand 
here ? and what does Christian Law make nec- 
essary here ? And yet these terms are nowhere 
defined ; they are used with little reference to 
their primitive meaning ; and even the right 
of Christianity to this supremacy is nowhere 
established. It seems to me that he construes 
the Christian Law very much to suit himself 
(always, however, for noble things), putting 
into it a great deal that did not belong to orig- 
inal Christianity, a great deal that is grandly 
human rather than specifically Christian. In 
this way the content of Christianity is en- 
larged and enriched, and people are thus led to 
accept many new things as Christian and au- 
thoritative, upon the supposition that they were 
a part of original Christianity. But it may 
well be doubted whether this course is justified 
by history, or is calculated to give social sci- 
ence the firmest basis, or motives of helpfulness 
the very greatest and most enduring power. 
However, the book is the word of an earnest 
man, and it will do good wherever read.

An excellent 

American 

Guide-book. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

By the publication of the long-prom- 
ised Baedeker's " United States " 
(imported by Scribner), American 
makers of guide-books are afforded a much needed 
object-lesson in compactness, in arrangement of ma- 
terial, and in beauty of cartography. In none of 
these respects has the Baedeker standard of excel- 
lence ever been approached by a guide-book of 
American production. Mr. J. F. Muirhead is the 
author of the book, and his work has been done 
with great care and thoroughness. We have no- 
ticed no considerable inaccuracies, and but few mis- 
prints, in spite of the Leipzig typography of the 
work. The special introductory features are an ac- 
count of our political history, by Professor Mc- 
Master; a study of our political institutions, by 
Professor Bryce ; North American physiography, 
by Professor N. S. Shaler ; chapters on the fine arts 
in America, by Messrs. W. A. Coffin and Mont- 
gomery Schuyler ; and essays upon our climate, our 
aborigines, our sports, and our social institutions. 
All the regular Baedeker features are included 
the introductory hints on railways, money, hotels, 
postal arrangements, etc.; the specimen tours, con- 
venient arrangement of routes, diagrams and plans 
for ready reference, asterisks to denote excellence 
or importance, and the many other features that 
have made the Baedeker guides models of their 
kind. Two or three points of special interest call 
for a word of mention. In comparing the railway 
trains of Europe and America, the author reaches 
the conclusion of most travellers, that the Euro- 
pean system is probably the better for short jour- 
neys, but that our system " reduces to a minimum 
the bodily discomfort and tedium of long railway 
journeys." We are also told that in the South and 
West the railway conductor is generally addressed 
as " captain." (Why not " colonel "?) The fol- 
lowing are hints to hotel-keepers desirous of Euro- 
pean patronage : " The wash-basins in the bedrooms 
should be much larger than is generally the case. 
Two or three large towels are preferable to the half- 
dozen small ones usually provided. A carafe or 
jug of fresh drinking-water (not necessarily iced) 
and a tumbler should always be kept in each bed- 
room. If it were possible to give baths more easily 
and cheaply, it would be a great boon to English 
visitors." The statement that "restaurants which 
solicit the patronage of ' gents ' should be avoided " 
is excellent, but should have been extended to include 
tailors who offer to provide mankind with " pants." 
We are given a glossary of the American language, 
with such definitions as these : " Boss, master, head, 
person in authority." " Bug, beetle, coleopterous in- 
sect of any kind." " Mad, vexed, cross." " Chicken, 
fowl of any age " ( the note of sarcasm should not 
escape an attentive listener). The author has 
learned, with evident surprise, that in America 
"weddings frequently take place in the evening, 
and are managed by a set of ' ushers ' chosen from 



the bridegroom's friends." As for Chicago, those 
who object to the pronunciation (Shekdhgo) given 
the word, will forgive the author when they read, 
further down upon the page, that "great injustice 
is done to Chicago by those who represent it as 
wholly given over to the worship of Mammon, as it 
compares favorably with many American cities in 
the efforts it has made to beautify itself by the cre- 
ation of parks and boulevards, and in its encourage- 
ment of education and the liberal arts." 



The author of Mr " Walter Lock ' s recent biography 
The Christian of John Keble ( Houghton) is an ad- 
equate presentment of a man whose 
life was in every way interesting and inspiring. 
The book is not a large one, but it is well planned 
and well written. Mr. Lock has evidently worked 
con amore. Such a life as Keble's demands sym- 
pathetic interpretation as well as accurate chron- 
icling, and this biography really interprets its sub- 
ject. Keble's early life, his importance in the Ox- 
ford Movement, his influence as a preacher and as 
an adviser, these phases of his life are faithfully 
portrayed ; his limitations are dwelt upon as dis- 
tinctly as are his points of strength. Keble's atti- 
tude toward the Church of England and the Church 
of Rome in the stirring times of half a century 
ago is of course fully set forth. The book presup- 
poses some knowledge of Tractarianism, but anyone 
who knows the main facts of the movement will 
readily learn here its true spirit. And yet, has not 
Mr. Lock taken for granted something it would 
have been better not to assume ? Many a man and 
many a woman, ignorant of Church history, have 
loved Keble through his work, and would gladly 
know him as he lived. For this large class of 
readers the present biography might have been made 
complete by a brief and explicit statement of the 
points at issue. " The Christian Year " is a term 
more familiar than Puseyism. In regard to Keble's 
literary career, it is not strange that one thinks of 
it last. " The Christian Year " is poetry, and its 
author was Professor of Poetry ; but writing was 
to him only a means to diviner things than lit- 
erature. Yet not the least interesting chapter in 
the book is one on the Prcelectioner Academical, the 
lectures on poetry that Keble delivered at Oxford. 
These lectures have never been translated into En- 
glish, so Mr. Lock's careful abstract of them is es- 
pecially valuable. In the present stage of criticism, 
we look to these discourses for loftiness of concep- 
tion rather than for authoritativeness. Keble had 
one ultimate criterion : a poet is in the first class 
or not, according as he possesses or lacks some one 
life-long potent feeling that appears in his work 
again and again. It is needless to comment on 
this theory further than to say that Mr. Lock suc- 
cessfully applies the test to Keble himself, and 
shows that throughout his poetry there is a "love 
of innocency " which may be taken as the keynote 
of all he wrote. It was indeed the underlying prin- 
ciple of Keble's life.

The literature of Persia, ancient and 
A useful book on moc iern, offers several distinct fields, 

Persian Literature. . , , . . 

each oi a good deal ot interest to us 
Occidentals of the present day. The study of the 
Cuneiform Inscriptions, besides giving us one of 
the most interesting chapters in the history of scien- 
tific research, connects directly with our recollec- 
tions of the Old Testament and of Herodotus. From 
another point of view the student of Comparative 
Religion and of Folklore finds, of course, in the 
" Avesta " the original sources for acquaintance with 
one of the earliest and most characteristic religions 
in mythological systems known to us. And in 
modern Persian Literature there is much of fasci- 
nation for one of more general interests. With 
Fitzgerald's " Omar Kha'yya'm," Matthew Arnold's 
" Sohrab and Rustum," and Sir Edwin Arnold's 
" With Sa'di in the Garden " still fresh in mind, 
we need not be reminded of the strangely charming 
literary characteristics which mark the work of 
Firdausi, Omar, Sa'di, Hafiz, and Attar. A His- 
tory of Persian Literature especially for English 
readers is thus an opportunity worthy of the scholar 
and the literary critic alike. Of this opportunity, 
Mrs. Elizabeth A. Reed, in her " Persian Litera- 
ture, Ancient and Modern" (Griggs), has taken 
advantage, and has produced a popular manual of 
the somewhat discrete subject described by the title. 
Our chief criticism upon the work must be that it 
slights the modern Persian literature of which most 
of us mainly think when the subject is mentioned. 
But it is, on the other hand, very full in its treat- 
ment of the earlier periods, and includes an im- 
portant section upon the " Koran." Mrs. Reed's 
acquaintance not only with her special subject but 
also with other ancient literatures, notably the San- 
skrit, enables her to compose an account of the 
Cunieform Inscriptions and the "Zend Avesta" 
which stimulates curiosity and satisfies the interest. 
The work is beautifully printed, and has a gor- 
geous frontispiece in gold and colors, reproducing 
a portion of an illuminated " Shah Nameh " manu- 
script. It is published uniform with the author's 
admirable manual of " Hindoo Literature." 

A correspondent Miss Jewsbury's Letters to Jane 
of Jane Welsh Welsh Carlyle " (Longmans) make 

Carlyle. i_ii I N , 

up a bulky volume that does not 
call for extended notice. Miss Geraldine Endsor 
Jewsbury was Mrs. Carlyle's most intimate friend 
and corresponded with her for a long time. The 
two agreed to burn each other's letters, but Mrs. 
Carlyle did not fulfil her part of the agreement, 
while Miss Jewsbury did. So we have only the 
latter's share of the correspondence. What Mrs. 
Carlyle's letters may have been we can partly guess 
and perhaps will not wholly regret their destruction. 
As to the letters before us, their value is not intrin- 
sically great ; they are diffuse, occasionally bright, 
occasionally witty, and always tender. They show 
the writer to be a woman of large capacity to love 
and to be loved, and of disappointment in the at- 



tainment of her ideals. Miss Jewsbury wrote nov- 
els and reviews, but her letters are not literary. 
The only reason for publishing them is the light 
they might throw on the life of the Carlyles. But 
in the first place, from this selection we learn little 
that is new, and in the second place that little is 
materially dimished by the irritating mode of edit- 
ing, which prints a dash for almost every proper 
name. Not only should names be given, but there 
should be an abundance of notes, which the editor, 
Mrs. Alexander Ireland, is able to supply. Her 
very readable life of Mrs. Carlyle showed her to be 
a capable worker in the field of Carlyle literature. 
This last volume in that field should be brought up 
to the level of her former volume. The sympa- 
thetic sketch of Miss Jewsbury's life is the most in- 
teresting part of the book. 

Seven lectures delivered last sum- 
S" mer befOTe the Plymouth School of 

Applied Ethics appear now in a vol- 
ume entitled "Philanthropy and Social Science" 
(Crowell). The first and second of the essays, by 
Miss Jane Addams, entitled " The Subjective Neces- 
sity for Social Settlements " and " The Objective 
Value of a Social Settlement," are interesting ser- 
mons in behalf of this new form of social organiza- 
tion in cities, with Hull House in Chicago as a text. 
The third, by Robert A. Woods, discusses the " Uni- 
versity Settlement Idea " from the point of view of 
the Andover House in Boston. Father James 0. 
S. Huntington contributes the fourth and fifth, 
which deal with the general principles of modern 
philanthropy in an incisive manner. The sixth is 
by Prof . Franklin H. Giddings, on the "Ethics of 
Social Progress," and is by far the most valuable 
and original contribution in the book. The last, by 
Bernard Bosanquet, on the " Principles and Chief 
Dangers of the Administration of Charity," is a 
brief statement of some of the commonplaces of 
scientific charity. While this volume contains much 
that is true and sensible, it lacks somewhat in con- 
tinuity and originality. These were- undoubtedly 
interesting and profitable lectures, but they touch 
only very superficially a few phases of the philan- 
thropic problem. They do not go deep enough for 
the scientific student, while the general reader can 
do better by devoting himself to manuals more spe- 
cific and extensive in information. 



Mr. Oscar L. Trigg's " Browning 
and Whitman: A Study in Democ- 
racy " (Macmillan) is a book that is 
more suggestive than conclusive. Democracy is de- 
fined as " self-government," the " absolute and free 
control of one's self." All that tends to develop 
the soul to its freest, fullest limits, and all that 
tends to band together self-controlled individuals, 
is in its essence democratic. To point out these 
principles in the two poets is the object of Mr. 
Trigg's analysis. Not a difficult task, surely; for 
Browning stands for the independence and preem-

inence of the soul, and Whitman stands for the in- 
dependence and fellowship of man. Other writers 
are grouped with the two who name the book, 
Lowell, Emerson, Wagner, and the author says a 
great deal about them all that is penetrating and 
sympathetic. But he writes with the air of one who 
has a thesis to prove and a world to persuade, and 
the result is something partly one-sided and partly 
rhapsodical. The former effect is produced by his 
seeming lack of sympathy with poets like Words- 
worth ; the latter effect by the extremely large 
number of poetical citations. Out of 140 pages 
there are hardly a score that are not broken into 
by quotations. After a while this produces a mo- 
notony which materially and unjustly detracts from 
the author's prose. All in all, the book is spirited 
and thoughtful, and if it does not persuade every- 
one to its wide-reaching optimism, it is because 
America is still far from being democratic in our 
author's sense. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

THE second volume has just appeared of Green's

Reformation period to the death of Elizabeth, two more 
volumes being necessary to complete the work. The 
illustrations are very numerous, a mere list of them, 
with brief descriptive notes, filling nearly thirty pages. 
It would be superfluous to praise the execution of this 
work, which is in all respects mechanically satisfactory. 
It should be found in every library, public or private. 

" THE Yearbook of Science " for 1892 (Dodd), edited 
by Professor T. G. Bonney, is the second issue of the 
series to which it belongs. The departments have been 
undertaken by the best specialist authorities, and the 
work offers a manual indispensable to every worker in 
physics or chemistry, in geology or biology. Refer- 
ences are given with unusual precision, and results are 
so concisely summarized as to permit the inclusion of a 
vast amount of matter. 

MR. Francis H. Underwood's study of " The Poet 
and the Man " (Lee & Shepard) gives us both a brief 
biography of Lowell and a generous tribute to his per- 
sonal qualities. The author knew Lowell quite inti- 
mately for nearly forty years, and, while his book gives 
us little or nothing that is absolutely new, it has the 
effect of bringing us very close to the lovable person- 
ality of its subject, and to make us realize afresh how 
worthy were the ideals for which Lowell stood, and how 
consistent was his devotion to their service. The vol- 
ume, which is an expansion of an article written for 
" The Contemporary Review," is prettily printed. 

FOUR pamphlet sermons that come to us from the 
Rev. James De Normandie, of Boston, are of timely in- 
terest. Two of them are memorials, respectively of A. 
P. Peabody and Bishop Brooks. The others are on 
" Sunday and the Columbian Fair " and " The Injustice 
to the Chinese," upon both of which subjects the author 
discourses with graceful and persuasive eloquence from 
the humane standpoint. We cordially commend these 
books to our readers. (Boston: Damrell & Upham.) 



LITERARY NOTES AND NEWS. 

Mr. W. H. Bishop has been appointed instructor in 
French and Spanish at Yale University. 

" The Builders of American Literature," by Mr. F. 
H. Underwood, a work in two volumes, is announced 
by Messrs. Lee & Shepard. 

Professor Goldwin Smith is writing a book upon " The 
Political History of the United States," and the first 
volume is announced for autumn publication by the 
Macmillans. 

The life of Sir Richard Francis Burton, upon which 
his widow has been engaged almost continuously since 
his death, will be published soon. The first portion is 
mainly autobiographical. It will be in two volumes, 
with portraits, colored illustrations, and maps. 

The final posthumous volume of Victor Hugo's poet- 
ical works is to be published immediately, with the 
title " Toute la Lyre, Seconde Se'rie." M. Auguste 
Vacquerie and M. Paul Meurice have classified the con- 
tents into eight parts, corresponding with the seven 
strings of the ancient lyre, with the addition of an 
eighth suggested by a line of the poet's, " Et j'ajoute k 
ma lyre une corde d'airain." 

" The Californian " for July comes to us with a new 
cover, probably the most beautiful that has ever adorned 
an American magazine. It is printed in gold and col- 
ors, and has the California poppy, in leaf, flower, and 
fruit, for its characteristic ornament. The cover is 
made particularly charming by its wayward grouping 
of the poppy-blossoms, which are of natural size, and in 
no way conventionalized. 

The Trinity (Dublin) correspondent of the London 
" Academy " has the following about one of our recent 
guests: "The return of Professor Tyrrell from Amer- 
ica has relieved the College from some anxiety, for dur- 
ing his stay in the West he suffered from serious illness, 
which, though it did not stay or spoil his lecturing 
this was due to his indomitable character marred his 
enjoyment, and caused much alarm amongst his col- 
leagues. He is now restored to health, and he speaks 
in the strongest terms of the sympathy and hospitality 
of his American friends." 

The London house occupied for over half a century 
by Samuel Rogers is to be sold. It may be said that 
there is scarcely a single representative of literature 
who during the first half of the present century was not 
a more or less frequent guest within its walls, from 
Lord Byron, Shelley, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge down 
to Thomas Campbell, Sir Walter Scott, Moore, Sydney 
Smith, and Mrs. Norton ; and there is scarcely a single 
celebrity of that age in whose memoirs the hospitable 
breakfasts of Sam Rogers and his constant " Table 
Talk " do not stand recorded. 

Mr. Longworth, the British Consul at Trebizond, re- 
ports that all books, pamphlets, and papers, even those for 
Persia, undergo the strictest censorship along that coast. 
Stationery is also examined for writings in invisible inks. 
Such as contain a likeness of the Sultan, disparaging 
remarks on Mahomedanism, or political reflection un- 
favorable to Turkey are condemned. The long list in- 
cludes Greek and Armenian proscribed books, besides 
thirty French and four English namely, the Koran, 
Byron's works, the handbook to Turkey in Asia, and 
the " Pacha of Many Tales," by Captain Marryat. 

The subscriptions to the Shelley memorial amounted 
to about fifteen hundred dollars, of which more than

[July 1, 



one-fourth came from this country. It is proposed to 
use the money as a foundation for an annual English 
literature prize at the Horsham Grammar School. Lady 
Shelley's monument to the poet, at University College, 
Oxford, was formally inaugurated by the donor a few 
days ago. A Tennyson Memorial is now projected for 
Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight. There are two propos- 
als before the projectors a committee formed in Fresh- 
water itself. One is to substitute for the existing 
wooden beacon on the highest part of the Freshwater 
Down a stone tower. The other is the erection of a 
granite monolith in the form of an lona cross at the 
corner of Farringdon-lane, along which the poet often 
walked. The committee ask for 500. About half 
that sum has already been collected.

THE WHITE CITY : July 10, 1893. 



Here for the world to see men brought their fairest; 

Whatever of beauty is in all the earth: 
The priceless flower of art, the loveliest, rarest, 

Here by our inland ocean came to glorious birth.

Yet on this day of doom a strange new splendor 

Shed its celestial light on all men's eyes: 
Flower of the hero-soul, consummate, tender, 
That from the tower of flame sprang to the eternal 
skies.

THE CONGRESS OF A UTHORS. 

It is hardly possible, at a date when the Lit- 
erature Congresses have but just completed 
their work, to take anything like a philosoph- 
ical survey of the week's proceedings. We 
have, however, thought it best, even at the risk 
of offering our readers an incomplete and im- 
perfectly digested report, to summarize the 
series of events that have made the week just 
ended noteworthy in the intellectual history of 
Chicago. If we may not tell the whole story, 
and if our coign of vantage be too near the ob- 
ject for realization of the proper perspective, 
our report may at least embody the salient fea- 
tures of the Congresses, and point a possible 
moral here and there. As has already been 
stated in these pages, Congresses to the num- 
ber of five were planned for the week ending 
July 15, their subjects being Literature proper, 
Philology, Folk-lore, History, and Libraries. 
They have provided an intellectual repast be- 
wildering in variety, and quite beyond the as- 
similative powers of such rash mortals as may 
have attempted to partake of all the courses. 
They have been characterized by many notable 
contributions to both general and special cul- 
ture, as well as by many of those discussions 
and comparisons of diverse views from which a 
subject often receives more light than from 
some more formal method of treatment. 

The Congresses were happily opened on 
Monday evening, July 10, by a general recep- 



28 



[July 16, 



tion given to such of the participants in the 
week's work as had at that time reached the 
city. The reception began with the usual in- 
troductions and handshakings, and ended with 
a few speeches of welcome by representatives 
of the World's Congress Auxiliary, followed 
by responses from some of the more distin- 
guished guests. Under the latter category come 
the remarks made by Mr. Charles Dudley 
Warner, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, Mr. 
George W. Cable, Mr. Walter Besant, and 
Dr. Max Richter. In the course of Mr. War- 
ner's remarks, a tribute was paid to the beau- 
ties of the World's Fair, and the speaker con- 
cluded with these words : 

" I fear all the time that the Fair will disappear, and, 
as I say, I grudge every moment spent away from it, 
for it will go, like everything else that we have created 
by hand. And when it has gone these poor scribblers 
who have not money enough to create it and many of 
them not imagination enough to put it into poetry or into 
romance even because I don't know anybody, except 
St. John in the Apocalypse, who has hit it off at all so 
far these poor scribblers will have to take up the 
task of perpetuating this creation of beauty and of 
splendor, and the next generation that wanders about 
Lake Michigan looking at the ruins of Chicago the 
distant generation, of course will have to depend upon 
some wandering bard who even then won't be half paid, 
I dare say for the remembrance, for the description of 
the great achievement of this city of Chicago in 1893." 

Mr. Gilder, in a few well-chosen words, con- 
trasted the literary art with the arts of form 
and color, pointing out that the very subtlety of 
the former makes its discussion difficult. Hence 
the speaker concluded that a Congress of Au- 
thors must of necessity for the most part deal 
with the physical side of literature, with " the 
relation of that art to its presentation through 
books to the public." Probably the most 
noteworthy incident of all this speech-making 
was to be found in the applause that inter- 
rupted Mr. Gilder when he said : " I, for one, 
would not have the countenance to stand up 
before a World's Congress of Authors if within 
a short time we, as a nation, had not wiped 
out the unbearable disgrace of international 
piracy." 

The sentiment thus expressed by Mr. Gil- 
der had many an echo in the subsequent pro- 
ceedings of the Congress of Authors. The 
Tuesday session of this Congress was devoted 
to the general subject of Copyright, and it was 
peculiarly fitting that Mr. George E. Adams 
should serve as the presiding officer. The en- 
actment of the Copyright Law of 1891 was, as 
our readers will remember, largely due to the 
efforts of Mr. Adams, then a member of the 



House of Representatives. Major Kirkland, 
who introduced Mr. Adams to the audience, 
gracefully alluded to this fact, as did also Mr. 
Gilder, when his turn came to share in the gen- 
eral discussion. That the services of Mr. Ad- 
ams had been appreciated, and were still re- 
membered by those present, appeared in the ap- 
plause that followed every allusion made to 
them. The discussion was opened by the pre- 
siding officer himself, who read an admirable 
paper upon our copyright legislation, past and 
future. He took an eminently sane and prac- 
tical view of the question, making clear the 
fundamental distinction between a copyright 
and a patent (a distinction too often neg- 
lected), but still averring that our future legis- 
lation is sure to be based upon the broad con- 
siderations of public policy rather than upon 
purely theoretical grounds. " The question of 
the so-called moral right of an author in his 
book is not likely to arise in any future move- 
ment in this country for the enlargement of 
authors' rights by Congress. Such legislation 
will be supported on the ground of public pol- 
icy rather than on the ground of just pro- 
tection of property." Dr. S. S. Sprigge, late 
Secretary of the London Society of Authors, 
followed Mr. Adams with a brief paper on 
" The International Copyright Union," sent 
to the Congress by Sir Henry Bergne, the Brit- 
ish Commissioner at the Berne Conference of 
1886. Dr. Sprigge also read a paper of his 
own upon the present complicated condition of 
copyright legislation, English and interna- 
tional. The remainder of the session was given 
up to an informal discussion, among the parti- 
cipants being Mr. Gilder, Mr. George W. Ca- 
ble, Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, Professor 
T. R. Lounsbury of Yale, President C. K. Ad- 
ams of the University of Wisconsin, and Gen- 
eral A. C. McClurg. There was general agree- 
ment among the speakers in deprecating the 
necessity of the " manufacturing clause " of 
the Act of 1891, but there was an equally gen- 
eral agreement in the admission that the law, 
with all its defects, is vastly better than no law 
at all. Even Professor Lounsbury, who pro- 
claimed himself one of the irreconcilables, ad- 
mitted the justice of this view. The injury 
done to writers by the condition of simultan- 
eous publication also came up for discussion, 
as well as the inadequacy of the term at pres- 
ent provided. " Nearly all our great Amer- 
ican authors have outlived their copyrights, 
which is a ridiculous perversion of justice," 
said Mr. Gilder ; and Mr. Warner, echoing the 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

opinion, allowed his wit to play upon the 
thought, greatly to the delight of his hearers. 

The copyright question was again brought 
forward, at the Wednesday session, by Mr. 
R. R. Bowker, editor of "The Publishers' 
Weekly," who read a carefully prepared paper 
upon " The Limitations of Copyright." We 
may also mention in this connection, as an il- 
lustration of the interest taken by foreign coun- 
tries in the work of the Congress, that a rep- 
resentative of the French Syndicat pour la 
Protection de la Propriete Litteraire et Artis- 
tique placed in the hands of the Committee, for 
distribution among the members of the Con- 
gress, a pamphlet " Note sur 1'Acte du 3 Mars 
1891," especially prepared and printed for the 
purpose. After congratulating the Copyright 
League upon the successful outcome of its la- 
bors, the pamphlet adds : "II ne saurait se 
presenter une occasion plus favorable que celle 
de la reunion du Congres de 1893 pour ex- 
primer les remerciements des interesses a tous 
ceux qui ont eu confiance en 1'esprit de justice 
du peuple americain." The special subject of 
the Wednesday session, "The Rights and In- 
terests of Authors," was introduced by Mr. 
Walter Besant, who also presided over the 
session. Mr. Besant's paper summarized the 
history of the London Society of Authors, ex- 
plaining also the reasons for its existence and 
the difficulties with which it has had to con- 
tend. A recent editorial in THE DIAL, upon 
the subject of the Society, gave the principal 
facts embodied in Mr. Besant's statement, and 
it is unnecessary to repeat them here. To the 
majority of those who heard them upon this 
occasion, they were doubtless new, and, as pre- 
sented by Mr. Besant, they were given the 
added force that always characterizes a man's 
spoken words upon some subject to which he has 
devoted years of active thought. The follow- 
ing is one of the passages of more general in- 
terest contained in Mr. Besant's paper : 

" We have made a careful and prolonged inquiry into 
the very difficult subject of the present nature and ex- 
tent of literary property. A writer of importance in 
our language may address an audience drawn from a 
hundred millions of English-speaking people. Remem- 
ber that never before in the history of the world has 
there been such an audience. There were doubtless 
more than a hundred millions under the Roman rule 
around the shores of the Mediterranean, but they spoke 
many different languages. We have now this enormous 
multitude, all, with very few exceptions, able to read, 
and all reading. Twenty years ago they read the weekly 
paper ; there are many who still read nothing more. Now 
that no longer satisfies the majority. Every day makes 
it plainer and clearer that we have arrived at a time when 
the whole of this multitude, which in fifty years' time will 



be two hundred millions, will very soon be reading books. 
What kind of books ? All kinds, good and bad, but 
mostly good ; we may be very sure that they will pre- 
fer good books to bad. Even now the direct road to 
popularity is by dramatic strength, clear vision, clear 
dialogue, whether a man write a play, a poem, a his- 
tory, or a novel. We see magazines suddenly achiev- 
ing a circulation reckoned by hundreds of thousands, 
while our old magazines creep along with their old cir- 
culation of from two to ten thousands. Hundreds of 
thousands ? How is this popularity achieved ? Is it 
by pandering to the low, gross, coarse taste commonly 
attributed to the multitude ? Not so. It is mainly ac- 
complished by giving them dramatic work stories 
which hold and interest them essays which speak 
clearly work that somehow seems to have a message. 
If we want a formula or golden rule for arriving at 
popularity, I should propose this: Let the work have 
a Message. Let it have a thing to say, a story to tell, 
a living Man or Woman to present, a lesson to deliver, 
clear, strong, unmistakable. 

" The demand for reading is enormous, and it in- 
creases every day. I see plainly as plainly as eyes 
can see a time- it is even now already upon us 
when the popular writer the novelist, the poet, the 
dramatist, the historian, the physicist, the essayist 
will command such an audience so vast an audience 
as he has never yet even conceived as possible. Such a 
writer as Dickens, if he were living now, would command 
an audience all of whom would buy his works of 
twenty millions at least. The world has never yet wit- 
nessed such a popularity so wide-spread as awaits 
the successor of Dickens in the affections of the En- 
glish speaking races. The consideration must surely en- 
courage us to persevere in our endeavors after the in- 
dependence and therefore the nobility of our calling, 
and therefore the nobility of our work. But you must 
not think that this enormous demand is for fiction alone. 
One of the things charged upon our Society is that we 
exist for novelists alone. That is because literary property 
is not understood at all. As a fact educational literature 
is a much larger and more valuable branch than fiction. 
But for science, history everything except, perhaps, 
poetry the demand is leaping forward year after year 
in a most surprising manner. Now, in order to meet 
this enormous demand, which has actually begun and 
will increase more and more a demand which we alone 
can meet and satisfy I say that we must claim and that 
we must have a readjustment of the old machinery 
a reconsideration of the old methods a new appeal to 
principles of equity and fair play." 

The remainder of this session was taken up 
by a paper on " Syndicate Publishing," sent by 
Mr. W. Morris Colles, of London, by " Some 
Considerations on Publishing," a paper sent by 
Sir Frederick Pollock, and by a discussion in 
which part was taken by Mr. Besant, Mr. 
Charles Carleton Coffin, Mrs. Mary Hartwell 
Catherwood, and Mrs. D. Lothrop. 

The general subject of " Criticism and Lit- 
erature " occupied the Thursday session of the 
Congress. Over this session Mr. Charles Dud- 
ley Warner presided, and read the opening 
paper, his subject being " The Function of Lit- 
erary Criticism in the United States." Mr. 



30 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Warner's paper is so sound and so suggestive 
that we feel justified in reproducing a some- 
what lengthy extract. 

" There seems to be a general impression that in a 
new country like the United States, where everything 
grows freely, almost spontaneously, as by a new crea- 
tive impulse, literature had better be left to develop 
itself without criticism, as practically it has been left 
every tree to get as high as it can without reference to 
shape or character. I say, as practically it has been 
left. For while there has been some good criticism in 
this country of other literatures, an application of sound 
scholarship and wide comparison, there has been very 
little of this applied to American literature. There has 
been some fault-finding, some ridicule, a good deal of 
the slashing personality and the expression of individual 
prejudice and like or dislike, which characterized so 
much of the British review criticism of the beginning 
of this century much of it utterly conventional and 
blind judgment but almost no attempt to ascertain the 
essence and purport of our achievement and to arraign 
it at the bar of comparative excellence, both as to form 
and substance. I do not deny that there has been some 
ingenious and even just exploiting of our literature, with 
note of its defects and its excellences, but it will be 
scarcely claimed for even this that it is cosmopolitan. 
How little of the application of universal principles to 
specific productions ! We thought it bad taste when Mat- 
thew Arnold put his finger on Emerson as he would put 
his finger on Socrates or on Milton. His judgment may 
have been wrong, or it may have. been right; matter of 
individual taste we would have been indifferent to; it 
seemed as if it were the universality of the test from 
which our national vanity shrank. We have our own 
standards ; if we choose, a dollar is sixty-five cents, and 
we resent the commercial assertion that a dollar is one 
hundred cents. 

" It seems to me that the thing the American litera- 
ture needs just now, and needs more than any other 
literature in the world, is criticism. In the essay by 
Matthew Arnold to which I have referred, and in which, 
as you remember, he defines criticism to be 'a disin- 
terested endeavor to learn and propagate the best that 
is known and thought in the world,' he would have had 
smooth sailing if he had not attempted to apply his 
principles of criticism to the current English literature. 
And this application made the essay largely an exposi- 
tion of the British Philistine. The Philistine is, in his 
origin and character, a very respectable person, whether 
he is found in Parliament, or in Exeter Hall, or in 
a newspaper office ; he is incased in tradition. The 
epithet, borrowed from the German, would not have 
stung as it did if Arnold had not further defined the 
person to be, what Ruskin found him also in En- 
gland and Wagner in Germany, one inaccessible to new 
ideas. 

" Now, we have not in the United States the Philis- 
tine, or Philistinism, at least not much of it, and for 
the reason that we have no tradition. We have thrown 
away, or tried to throw away, tradition. We are growing 
in the habit of being sufficient unto ourselves. We 
have not Philistinism, but we have something else. 
There has been no name for it yet invented. Some say 
it is satisfaction in superficiality, and they point to the 
common school and to Chautauqua; the French say that 
it is satisfaction in mediocrity. At any rate it is a sat- 
isfaction that has a large element of boastfulness in it, 



and boastfulness based upon a lack of enlightenment, 
in literature especially a want of discrimination, of fine 
discernment of quality. It is a habit of looking at lit- 
erature as we look at other things ; literature in na- 
tional life never stands alone if we condone crooked- 
ness in politics and in business under the name of smart- 
ness, we apply the same sort of test, that is the test of suc- 
cess, to literature. It is the test of the late Mr. Barnum. 
There is in it a disregard of moral as well as of artistic 
values and standards. You see it in the press, in ser- 
mons even, the effort to attract attention, the lack of 
moderation, the striving to be sensational in poetry, in 
the novel, to shock, to advertise the performance. Ev- 
erything is on a strain. No, this is not Philistinism. 
I am sure, also, that it is not the final expression of the 
American spirit, that which will represent its life or 
its literature. I trust it is a transient disease, which 
we may perhaps call by a transient name, Barnumism." 

Another paper of importance, sent by Mr. 
Hamilton W. Mabie (who was unfortunately 
absent), had for its subject " Criticism as an 
Educational Force." Speaking of the change 
that has of late years come over the spirit of 
criticism, Mr. Mabie writes : 

" It was not until criticism passed into the hands of 
men of insight and creative power that it discovered its 
chief function to be that of comprehension, and its 
principal service that of interpretation. Not that it 
has surrendered its function of judging according to 
the highest standards, but that it has discovered that 
the forms of excellence change from time to time, and 
that the question with regard to a work of art is not 
whether it conforms to types of excellence already fa- 
miliar, but whether it is an ultimate expression of 
beauty or power. In every case the artist creates the 
type and the critic proves his competency by recogniz- 
ing it; so that while the critic holds the artist to rigid 
standards of veracity and craftsmanship it is the artist 
who lays down the law to the critic. As an applied art, 
based on induction and constructing its canons apart 
from the material which literature furnishes, criticism 
was notable mainly for its fallability. As an art based 
on deduction, and framing its laws in accordance with the 
methods and principles illustrated in the best literature, 
it has advanced from a secondary to a leading place 
among the literary forms now most widely employed 
and most widely influential." 

Mr. H. D. Traill, of Oxford, sent to the Con- 
gress a paper upon " The Relations of Litera- 
ture and Journalism," from which we quote the 
opening paragraph: 

" There never was a more promising subject for peo- 
ple who are fond of a good discursive debate, not likely 
to be brought to an abrupt and disappointing close 
by a sudden agreement between the disputants, than 
the subject of the relations between Literature and 
Journalism. A discussion of it combines almost every 
possible attraction ambiguity of terms, indefiniteness 
of area, uncertainty of aim everything in short that 
the heart of the most ardent controversialist could de- 
sire. I have been privileged to hear many such discus- 
sions and to take part in some of them, and on no oc- 
casion can I remember to have met with any debater 
so pedantic as to ask for a definition either of Literature 
or Journalism, at any stage of the argument. A sound

instinct seems to warn people that if they were to do 
that, the particular debate engaged in would immediately 
branch off either into a prolonged and probably tech- 
nical inquiry into the precise meaning and limits of the 
term Journalism or into an interminable and almost cer- 
tainly violent dispute as to what constitutes Literature. 
The latter question in especial is full of " excellent dif- 
ferences" for those who care to discuss it: because ac- 
cording to some theorists on the subject there would 
seem to be scarcely any written or printed matter 
when once you have risen above the Postoffice Direct- 
ory which is not literature ; while with the very super- 
fine class of critics, the difficulty is to find anything that 
is. Literature begins for the former almost where it be- 
gan with Dogberry. Anyone who could have " pleaded 
his clergy " in the middle ages, would in their view ap- 
parently have been a literary man. Between this esti- 
mate and that of the Superfine Critic who claims to 
confine the name of literature to some limited class of 
composition which he happens himself to admire, or 
perhaps affect, the gap yawns enormous : and I for one 
have no intention of attempting to bridge it. The true 
definition of literature no doubt lies somewhere between 
them; and will be fixed on that auspicious day when 
it is found possible to determine the exact proportions 
in which Form and Matter enter into the constitution 
of literary merit. In the meantime we must content 
ourselves with admitting that form is certainly, if in an 
undefined degree, the more important of the two. It 
would be dangerous to admit any more than this in a 
day when so many minor poets are abroad; for a con- 
siderable number of these, while particularly careful of 
form, have reduced the value of their matter to a van- 
ishing point, and any encouragement to them to carry 
the process yet further is to be strongly deprecated. 
Still this much, as I have said, must be admitted: that 
it is primarily form rather than matter which consti- 
tutes literature." 

Among other papers presented at the Thurs- 
day session was that sent by Mr. Henry Ar- 
thur Jones, who took for his subject " The Fu- 
ture of the English Drama," and forecast it 
with an optimism quite excusable in the writer 
of so many serious and successful plays. While 
this session was in progress, the subject of " Lit- 
erature for Children " was under consideration 
in another hall of the building, and -papers 
were read by Mrs. D. Lothrop, Mrs. Elia W. 
Peattie, and Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth. In 
the afternoon, a programme of authors' read- 
ing for children was carried out in the pres- 
ence of a very large audience, composed mostly 
of young people. 

" Aspects of Modern Fiction " was the gen- 
eral subject of the Friday session of the Con- 
gress. Mr. George W. Cable was asked to 
preside, and the choice was no less happy than 
that of the chairmen for the three preceding 
sessions. Mr. Cable followed the example of 
his predecessors in the chair, and read the 
opening paper, his subject being : " The Uses 
and Methods of Fiction." We extract a pas- 
sage from the close of this paper : 



" We live in a day unparalleled by any earlier time 
in its love and jealousy for truth. In no field of search 
after truth have we been more successful than in sci- 
ence. Our triumphs here have kindled in us such en- 
ergy and earnest enthusiasm, we have been tempted, 
both readers and writers, to forget that facts are not 
the only vehicle of truth. In our almost daily trium- 
phant search, through the simple study of facts as they 
are, for the human race's betterment, we have learned to 
yield our imaginations too subserviently to the rule and 
discipline of the fact-hunters, and a depiction of desira, 
ble but as yet unrealized conditions across achasm os 
impracticability is often unduly and unwisely resented. 

" The world will do well to let its story-tellers be as 
at their best they have ever been, ambassadors of hope. 
The fealty they owe is not a scientific adherence and 
confinement to facts and their photographic display, 
however benevolently such an attitude may be inspired, 
save in so far as they may help them the more delight- 
fully to reveal the divine perfections of eternal truth 
and beauty. 

" Yet if it is true that there is no more law to com- 
pel the fictionist to teach truth than there is to require 
the scientist to be a poet, there are reasons why in more 
or less degree, and in the great majority of cases, he 
will choose to teach. One of these reasons lies on the 
surface. It is that in fictional literature, at least, Truth, 
duly subordinated to Beauty as the queen of the realm, 
is her greatest possible auxiliary and ally. No page 
of fiction ought ever to contain a truth without which 
the page would be more beautiful than with it. As 
certainly when truth ignores beauty as when beauty 
ignores truth, a discount falls upon the value of both in 
the economy of the universe. Yet on the other hand 
beauty in the story-teller's art, while it may as really, 
can never so largely and nobly, minister to the soul's 
delight without the inculcation of truth as with it. 

" Hence it is that fiction's peculiar ministry to the 
human soul is the prose depiction, through the lens of 
beauty, to the imagination and the emotions, of conflicts 
of human passions, wills, duties, and fates ; a depiction 
unaccompanied by any tax of intellectual labor, but con- 
sistent with all known truth, though without any nec- 
essary intervention of actual facts. Or, more briefly, it is 
the contemplation of the truths of human life as it ought 
to be, compared with the facts as they are. 

" If this is the fictionist's commission, is not his com- 
mission his passport also in the economist's world ? It 
would be easy to follow out the radiations of this func- 
tion and show their value by their simple enumeration. 
In the form of pure romance it fosters that spirit of 
adventure which seeks and finds new worlds and which 
cannot be lightly spoken of while we celebrate the dis- 
coveries of Columbus. In all its forms it helps to ex- 
ercise, expand, and refresh those powers of the imag- 
ination whose decay is the hectic fever and night-sweat of 
all search for truth and beauty; of science and inven- 
tion, art, enterprise, and true religion. Often it gives 
to the soul otherwise imprisoned by the cramped walls 
of the commonplace, spiritual experiences of life re- 
fined from some of their deadliest risks, and cuts win- 
dows in the walls of cramped and commonplace envir- 
onments. At its best it elevates our conceptions of the 
heroic and opens our eyes to the presence, actuality, and 
value of a world of romance that is, and ought to be, 
in our own lives and fates." 

Mrs. Mary Hartwell Catherwood followed Mr. 
Cable with a paper on " Form and Condensa- 



32 



[July 16, 



tion in the Novel." We print a portion of 
Mrs. Catherwood's remarks, regretting that we 
have not space for them all. 

" Whoever attempts a novel is supposed to have a 
story to tell; and the manner of his telling it is almost 
as important as the story itself. It is always what- 
ever variations the theme may take the story of a 
man and a woman ; often a sad, often an absurd story ; 
but one which is as fresh with every generation as new 
grass with the spring. The dear little maid whom you 
now call the light of your house will soon reach her 
version of it. She tells you in confidence, and with a 
stammer on the long word, that she has a prejudice 
against boys, and you know what that prejudice in the 
course of a few years will do with the incipient men 
who are hanging May-baskets or doing sums for her. 

" It seems to me the best form for this story is the 
dramatic form. We want intensified life. 'It is the 
quality of the moment that imports,' says Emerson. Of 
what interest are our glacial periods, our slow transi- 
tions that change us we know not why ? Everyone can 
look back on many differing persons he has been in his 
time. And everyone is conscious of undeveloped iden- 
tities hampered yet within him. The sweetest and sin- 
cerest natures have repressions and concealments. It 
is the result of these things which makes the story of 
life. You may put a microscope over a man and fol- 
low his trail day by day; but unless he reaches some 
stress of loving, suffering, doing, you soon lose inter- 
est in him. I delight in Jane Austen for the qual- 
ity of her work. In the same way I enjoy the work of 
Mr. Howells. It is their dramatic grasp on the com- 
monplace which makes these realists great. 

" The most dramatic treatment cannot wholly present 
the beauty of one human soul, and the sternest analysis 
cannot reach all its convolutions of evil. Shakespeare 
knew his human soul. When we are very young we 
complain that he pictures us unfairly; but when we 
are older, we know. He took the great moments, that 
counted; and presented his men and women intensely 
alive. 

" I have heard there are authors who do not rewrite 
and condense, who set down at the first stroke the 
word they want to use; the word which creates. But 
I never absolutely laid hands on one. The growth of 
a story is usually slow, like the growth of most plants. 
It is labor and delight, pain and pleasure, despair and 
hope. You cannot escape a pang. You must abso- 
lutely live it through ; and then try it by the test of 
ridicule of common standards, by the guage of human 
nature. I heard a judge say when he was a college 
student he kicked all the bark off a log in the campus, 
and wore out the backs of a new pair of trousers, try- 
ing to write a poem; and he made up his mind he was 
no poet. If the spirit of art had really been in him he 
would have recognized these agonies. It is not easy to 
speak the word except when it is easy ; when you 
have those moments of clear seeing and that condens- 
ing grasp of your material which sometimes pay for 
days of worthless labor." 

The remaining papers of the session were as 
follows: "The Short Story," by Miss Alice 
French; "The New Motive in Fiction," by 
Mrs. Anna B. McMahan; "Local Color in 
Fiction," by Mr. Hamlin Garland ; and " Ebb- 
Tide in Realism," by Mr. Joseph Kirkland. The 



Friday session of the Congress seemed to arouse 
a more general public interest than any of the 
others, and was distinguished from them by 
the fact that all the papers presented upon 
this occasion were read by their authors. 

Our account has thus far dealt almost ex- 
clusively with the special subject of the Con- 
gress of Authors. When we consider the fact 
that this Congress has been the first of the sort 
to be held by writers in the English language, 
and the other fact that there existed in this coun- 
try no definite association of literary workers 
to take charge of the arrangements, there is 
reason to congratulate the committees in charge 
upon the outcome of their enterprise. To the 
non-resident Committee of Cooperation, and 
particularly to its secretary, Professor George 
E. Woodberry, who labored long and strenu- 
ously for the success of the work, a special and 
hearty word of recognition is due. It is true 
that there have been many disappointments 
that some who should have taken part in the 
work declined the invitation to do so, and that 
others who had promised their help and their 
presence failed to come forward at the final 
moment, but, with allowance for all these 
mishaps, it must be admitted that the Congress 
achieved a distinct success, that its sessions 
were dignified and thought-provoking, that it 
attracted the serious attention of a considera- 
ble and influential public, and that it has paved 
the way for a better organization of author- 
ship, and a better understanding of literature 
both in its commercial and its artistic aspects. 
The proceedings of the Congress of Authors 
will have many echoes in the periodical litera- 
ture of the coming weeks ; and, if they shall be 
subsequently published, as is hoped, in perma- 
nent form, their effect will be felt far beyond 
the moment, and is likely to make itself appar- 
ent both in predicable and in unpredicable 
ways. 

Of the four remaining Congresses of the 
week we have not, upon the present occasion, 
space to speak in detail. We must be content 
with saying that they brought to Chicago ex- 
ceptionally large gatherings of the four classes 
of specialists to whom appeal was made, in- 
cluding many European scholars of the first 
rank ; that their programmes covered a very 
wide range of original research ; and that, in 
spite of the tropical temperature of the week, 
and the counter attractions of the World's Fair, 
they were attended by audiences commensurate 
with the interest and importance of what the 
proceedings had to offer.

THE PUBLIC CAREER OF CHARLES 
STJMNER.* 



Mr. Pierce has brought to a successful con- 
clusion, in the third and fourth volumes of his 
" Memoir and Letters of Charles Sumner," 
the story of the life of an eminent statesman, 
whose career was singularly useful in promot- 
ing moral ideas in the realm of politics. If 
Charles Sumner failed to realize the full meas- 
ure of his ambition no one ever does it could 
not be said of him that he put his manhood in 
the balance upon the chance of winning the 
Presidency. Herein is a lesson for those who 
choose a public career with honorable aspira- 
tions. 

The volumes before us cover the period from 
1845 to 1874 twenty-nine years of agitation 
and human activity of profound significance to 
mankind, during a portion of which it was un- 
certain whether civilization would be advanced 
or retarded. The year 1845 finds Sumner in 
the prime of manhood, fairly launched upon a 
professional career at the bar, which one can- 
not but believe, if no other claims had inter- 
vened, would have won high distinction. He 
was a favorite in society, the friend and asso- 
ciate of Longfellow, Hillard, and other liter- 
ary men at home, and a correspondent of men 
of distinction abroad. His broad culture and 
oratorical gifts made him a man of mark, con- 
cerning whom there was much prophetic spec- 
ulation. Conservatism, controling commerce, 
manufacturing, and finance, wooed him with 
assiduity. His abilities exerted to maintain 
the established order of things would have 
" strengthened the bulwarks of society," and he 
would have been rewarded with her richest 
gifts. The temptation was great, but conserv- 
atism failed. Charles Sumner elected to be 
an agitator for moral and political reform. 
When society became frigid, when the doors 
of the best houses were closed to him, he grieved 
and wondered much. Disfavor was mani- 
fested even before he became an Antislavery 
leader ; while he was advocating prison reform 
and promoting the aims of the Peace Society. 
Antislavery was only the last straw. The an- 
tagonism that resulted was bitter, unyielding, 
and far-reaching in its effects. At that day 
the refinement of Boston social life was most

ward L. Pierce. Vols. III. and IV. Boston : Roberts Bros. 



attractive, and charmed all who came under its 
influence. 

" Such a society was like that of ancient Athens more 
than any other modern city can show, intellectual, 
consolidated, despotic over individual thought, insisting 
on uniformity of belief in matters which were related 
to its interests, and frowning upon novelties which 
struck at its prestige." 

During the Mexican War controversy Sum- 
ner criticised the course of Mr. Winthrop in 
Congress, and further widened the breach that 
had already been made in the ranks of the 
Whig party in Massachusetts. We are told 
by Mr. Pierce that it cost him friendships 
which he valued dearly, and secluded him al- 
most entirely from general society. 

"It ended his visits at Nathan Appleton's. Tick- 
nor's door was closed to him; and when a guest at a 
party there inquired if Mr. Sumner was to be present, 
the host replied, ' He is outside of the pale of society.' 
The feeling became so pervasive in Boston's ' Belgra- 
via ' that a lady living on Beacon street, who had in- 
vited Sumner with other guests to dinner, received a 
withdrawal of an acceptance from one of them when he 
found Sumner was to be present, although he was not 
at all in politics, and had no personal grievance. Pres- 
cott, of gentler mood than his neighbors, though with 
no more sympathy than they in Sumner's themes, still 
welcomed him in his home on Beacon street and to his 
summer retreat ; but the tradition is that he was obliged 
to select his guests with care when Sumner was invited, 
lest the feast should be marred by unseemly behavior 
on their part. Longfellow and his wife, made of far 
finer mould than their kin or their class, were, in spite 
of their connection with Mr. Appleton, as devotedly at- 
tached to Sumner as ever, and kept a chamber at his 
service; but even they sometimes found it necessary to 
send him a warning from Cambridge that some one was 
with them whom it was not best for him to meet. 
Even his triumphant career his election to the Sen- 
ate and his fame as an orator did not soften this ani- 
mosity." 

It was undoubtedly this conservative influ- 
ence of the solid men of New England which 
changed Mr. Webster's political course, and 
prepared the way for the fatal seventh of 
March speech. Because of his uusoundness 
on the tariff and tendency toward Antislavery 
views, the class represented by Lawrence and 
the Appletons had preferred Clay for Presi- 
dent, much to his mortification. He strove to 
placate it, and succeeded so far that in 1848 
they advocated his nomination. It is claimed 
that their support was only nominal, their real 
choice being General Taylor, but it is certain 
that their influence over him was heightened 
rather than lessened. Webster's opposition to 
the annexation of Texas led many of the Con- 
science Whigs to look to him as a candidate, 
but Sumner distrusted him and opposed his 
selection. He preferred Corwin, whose happy

fortune it had been to speak the truth with 
fearlessness in the presence of a triumphant 
opposition one of a half-dozen great speeches 
illustrating the best of American oratory. Look- 
ing back upon the past, one cannot but regret 
that closer relations were not established be- 
tween the brilliant Ohioan and the Massachu- 
setts reformer, as the zeal of the latter would 
have stimulated the former to his best work, 
benefitted society, and changed the story of a 
life. 

The campaign of 1848 is one of the most cu- 
rious and instructive in American political his- 
tory. That the incongruous elements Free 
Soil Democrats, Conscience Whigs, and New 
York spoilsmen known as Barnburners led by 
B. F. Butler and Samuel J. Tilden which 
went to make up the Buffalo convention could 
fraternize, even for a day, was remarkable. 
We are told that 

" Both the nominating body and the mass-meeting 
were animated by a profound earnestness. A religious 
fervor pervaded the resolutions and addresses. The 
speakers asserted fundamental rights and universal ob- 
ligations, and iu their appeals and asseverations sought 
the sanctions of the Christian faith." 

But for once the reformers displayed common 
sense, and used the personal prestige of the 
wily old partisan of Kinderhook and his ma- 
chine to promote their cause. What if Mar- 
tin Van Buren had their help in revenging him- 
self upon Cass, and what if 1852 found But- 
ler and Tilden and John Van Buren and others 
of his followers turning their backs on those 
noble protests for freedom " which made 1848 
an illustrious year in American annals " and 
supporting Franklin Pierce for President,* 
opposition to slavery had made substantial 
gains and prepared the way for the struggle 
that followed the passage of the Compromise 
Measures, what was really the death-grapple 
with the Oligarchy. 

We now see coming into greater prominence 
Sumner, Horace Mann, Charles F. Adams, 
Henry Wilson, and R. H. Dana, Jr., who 
placed Massachusetts in the van of the Anti- 
slavery movement, despite the opposition of the 
powerful merchants of Boston and Webster. 
As the glory of the latter departed, the hero of 
the new crusade, also a great orator, was 
hailed with popular acclaim thus repeating 
the experience of every generation. 

* Tilden and other Barnburners, when secession was threat- 
ened, addressed the South in resolutions recognizing the right 
of slaveholders to carry their slaves into the territories and 
the justness of their grievances, which further heightens the 
insincerity of the Van Buren men in 1848. 



Sumner's career in the Senate is fresh in 
the recollection of our readers. His culture, 
industry, singleness of purpose, and perfect in- 
tegrity made him a true representative of the 
new North. When he spoke it was with a 
moral force surpassing that of all others. The 
world listened with respect. The opposition, 
enraged, struck back with brute force, to the 
injury of its own cause. 

During the administration of Mr. Lincoln, 
Sumner was an authority on all questions af- 
fecting our foreign relations ; but his devotion 
to Antislavery convictions often proved an em- 
barrassment. In common with others he mis- 
judged the President, underrated his capacity 
for leadership in such a crisis, and at times 
became impatient and censorious. He did not, 
however, as did Henry Winter Davis, Wade, 
and Chase, actively oppose Lincoln's renom- 
ination, or seek to force him to withdraw in 
the midst of the campaign of 1864, as did 
others. He said : 

" If Mr. Lincoln does not withdraw, then all who 
now disincline to him must come into his support. I 
have declined to sign any paper or take any part in any 
action, because I was satisfied that nothing could be 
done except through Mr. Lincoln and with his good-will. 
To him the appeal must be made, and on him must be 
the final responsibility." 

This was early in September. In a letter to 
Mr. Cobden, September 18, he expressed him- 
self more at length on this theme : 

" The hesitation in the support of Mr. Lincoln dis- 
appears at the promulgation of the Chicago treason. 
There was a meeting in New York of persons from dif- 
ferent parts of the country to bring about a new con- 
vention to nominate a Union candidate. The ' Tribune,' 
' Evening Post,' ' Independent,' and Cincinnati < Gazette' 
were all represented in it; but as soon as they read the 
platform, they ranged in support of Mr. Lincoln. . . . 
You understand that there is a strong feeling among those 
who have seen Mr. Lincoln, in the way of business, that 
he lacks practical talent for his important place. It is 
thought that there should be more readiness, and also 
more capacity for government. 

"... Chase for a long time hesitated in the support 
of Mr. Lincoln; he did not think him competent. But 
he finds that he has no alternative; as a patriot, he 
must oppose Chicago. The President made a great 
mistake in compelling him to resign. It was very much 
as when Louis XVI. threw overboard Necker, and by 
the way, I have often observed that Mr. Lincoln resem- 
bles Louis XVI. more than any other ruler in history. 
I once said to Chase that I should not be astonished if, 
like Necker, he was recalled, to which he replied, 'That 
might be if Mr. Lincoln were king and not politician.' 
Thus far the President has made no overture to him 
of any kind, although he has received him kindly." 

But Mr. Chase did make overtures through 
Governor Brough, seeking a restoration, the 
relation of the particulars of which (if this

were the proper place) would prove our Pres- 
ident very unlike Louis XVI. He was in pos- 
session of evidence that the effort to create the 
opinion that he lacked capacity for government, 
and that he had lost public confidence, had 
been persistently made by some of the inti- 
mate friends of Mr. Chase notably Senator 
Pomeroy for months, and that the Cleveland 
Convention was a part of the plan to promote 
the ambition of that statesman. The head- 
quarters of the faction on Vine street, Cincin- 
nati, were not closed until it became apparent 
that the scheme to force Mr. Lincoln to with- 
draw would fail. 

Our author fails to see the motive behind 
this opposition to Lincoln, or the peril to the 
Union cause in the midst of the campaign 
through the factious course of party leaders, 
an opposition that was kept up to within eight 
weeks of the election. He has fallen into error 
as to the attitude of the Cincinnati " Gazette " 
and of the part taken by its able directing head 
at that time. The " Gazette " was not in sym- 
pathy with Mr. Chase's views, and did not 
further his ambition. It did not indulge in 
captious criticisms of the President, but gave 
him loyal support. Its representative at the 
New York conference was undoubtedly there 
in the interest of harmony. It is true that 
its distinguished Washington correspondent, 
Mr. Whitelaw Reid, was on terms of intimacy 
with Mr. Chase, sympathized with the view of 
the situation taken by that statesman, Gov- 
ernor Andrew and other earnest men, and par- 
ticipated in the movement having for its ob- 
ject the retirement of Mr. Lincoln. But Mr. 
Richard Smith, the editor, was not " active in 
the movement," as our author says. There is 
a letter of his in the possession of a friend, 
written to a gentleman on intimate terms with 
Mr. Lincoln, frankly telling him that in a tour 
he had made through northern Ohio and Mich- 
igan in August he found a condition of apathy 
which threatened the defeat of the Union ticket. 
He expressed the same views to the writer, 
who at that time was conducting the canvas 
for the Union party in Ohio, and who assured 
him that the people were sound. This was the 
measure of Mr. Smith's opposition. The ma- 
jority for the State ticket in October was over 
56,000, and for Mr. Lincoln, a month later, 
over 64,000. 

The Union successes only served to engross 
Mr. Sumner's time more and more in behalf 
of the negro race. He would not only emanci- 
pate them, but confer upon them without prep- 



aration all of the rights and responsibilities 
of citizenship. In this regard he sharply an- 
tagonized the President and a majority of his 
party. Mr. Lincoln had much at heart the 
reconstruction of Louisiana, with white suf- 
frage. He held that the radicals were attempt- 
ing " to change this government from its orig- 
inal form and make it a strong centralized 
power." He is quoted by Mr. Welles as hav-. 
ing said on the last day of his life, "These 
humanitarians break down all State rights and 
Constitutional rights. Had the Louisianians 
inserted the negro in their Constitution, and 
had that instrument been in all other respects 
the same, Mr. Sumner would never have ex- 
cepted to that Constitution." The effort to 
carry out Mr. Lincoln's views led to an acri- 
monious debate in the Senate, in which Sum- 
ner appears to less advantage than on other 
occasions. To him belonged the responsibility 
of defeating the wishes of the President in the 
recognition of the State government of Louis- 
iana. " Sumner's behavior," said his friend 
Samuel Bowles, " in preventing a vote on the 
Louisiana question was perfectly unjustifiable. 
I shall henceforth be intolerant of him, always. 
It was undignified, disgraceful."* A breach 
between the President and the Senator was 
predicted, but the former, by marked atten- 
tions to Sumner, gave public notice that he was 
not going to quarrel. 

Far different was his experience when Grant 
was President. The Motley and San Domingo 
episodes, and his deposition from the chairman- 
ship of the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
made a breach which could never be healed, 
and loosened the ties that bound him to his 
party. A satisfactory explanation of this treat- 
ment of a distinguished senator for independ- 
ence of action on a public question has never 
been made. 

Mr. Sumner's plan of reconstruction came 
to be, after a struggle, the policy of his party. 
Theoretically it armed the emancipated negro 
withapower that should prove invincible against 
his former master, the power of the ballot, 
and it charged the general government with 
the responsibility of the execution of the law. 
To the party that adopted it, it has proved a 
veritable Pandora's box ; to the whole country- 
injurious, as it has perpetuated sectional di- 
visions, intensified race prejudices, and lessened 
respect for law. Wherein has the negro been 
benefited ? What is his part in government as 
an elector ? Clearly, his future yet lies before

The original skeleton with which his lectures 
began can be readily differentiated from notes 
added from year to year as the same lectures 
have been delivered to successive classes of 
students at Kiel. How thorough and how en- 
tertaining the lectures must have been, the 
book shows. One can imagine how each of 
the parenthetical references, interspersed in 
great profusion throughout the volumes, has 
been made to remind the lecturer of an illus- 
trative incident that has lost none of its effect- 
iveness in the telling. Lecture notes, how- 
ever, require much emendation and rearrange- 
ment as well as expansion to render them read- 
able in a printed volume, and to give English 
readers the benefit of his profound knowledge, 
the learned author of Kiel needed, quite as 
much as a translator, a careful editor, who 
could separate from the text the explanatory 
parentheses and citations of authorities and 
relegate them to their proper place as foot- 
notes or appendices. As it is, we have upon 
each page a confused mass of text, explana- 
tory notes, and references to authorities, in- 
terspersed with parentheses in some cases of

such length as to cause the reader to lose the 
thread of the narrative, the whole making 
the reading exceedingly laborious. The va- 
riety of types used in printing the book, 
Roman capitals and lower case, italics, and 
full-faced letters, tends to still greater con- 
fusion. It is evident that the full-faced letters 
are resorted to for emphasis. The reason for 
setting up the text in small pica with para- 
graphs here and there in bourgeois is not so 
evident. The book does not justify its appear- 
ance at this time either by adding newly dis- 
covered facts in history to those known to stu- 
dents in theology, or by presenting the old mat- 
ter in any new light. The author's deductions 
are those likely to be most acceptable to ultra- 
Protestant Germany. As a text-book, the 
work will probably be useful, its chief value 
consisting in its exhaustive bibliography. Cer- 
tainly its style is not calculated to popularize 
the study of Church History, or (to borrow a 
phrase from the author's preface) " to animate 
delight in that study." The present volume 
was intended to be the first of fehree to take up 
that number of great epochs of Church History. 
Whether or not the author's death (since 
Easter, 1891, the date of his preface) has in- 
terrupted the preparation of the subsequent 
volumes does not appear. 

A book-buyer might be led by the title of Pro- 
fessor Ramsay's recent book " The Church 
in the Roman Empire before A. D. 170 " and 
by its general appearance (it is an octavo of 
480 pages with an index) to expect a narrative 
history of a certain phase of the early church 
promising much of deep interest in its devel- 
opment. Such a one would probably be sur- 
prised, without being disappointed, upon find- 
ing in the volume an exemplification of " the 
method of applying archaeological, topograph- 
ical, and numismatic evidence to the investiga- 
tion of early Christian History." The volume 
bears as a somewhat misleading sub-title, 
" Mansfield College Lectures." The six lec- 
tures delivered at Mansfield College, Oxford, 
in 1892, form, indeed, the basis of the book, but 
these lectures (themselves almost entirely re- 
written) include a chapter expanded from a lec- 
ture delivered at Cambridge in 1889, and are 
preceded by a long excursus (divided into eight 
chapters) upon " St. Paul in Asia Minor." 
Therein the author supplements and corrects 
Conybeare and Howson and Dean Farrar in 
their biographies of St. Paul, from a topograph- 
ical study of Asia Minor, and he even corrects 
his own previously published " Historical Geog-

raphy." He shows a like frankness in the man- 
ner in which he celebrates, in his preface, his 
breaking away from the German critics whom he 
followed for years with much interest and zeal, 
and whose results he accepted. In recent years, 
and with a better understanding of Roman his- 
tory, he has realized that it is a gross outrage on 
criticism to hold most of the books of the New 
Testament for second-century forgeries. Much 
of the work before us is directed towards this 
point. 

Dr. Hurst's volume, " Short History of the 
Christian Church," would take up nearly the 
same amount of shelf-room as Dr. Moeller's, 
but it contains about a hundred pages more of 
text, besides statistical appendices and indices. 
Its typographical arrangement, however, is not 
so compact as that of the former volume, and 
if pains were taken to estimate the exact amount 
of verbal matter in each, it would probably be 
found that there was little difference. As- 
suming this result, it is interesting to note that 
Dr. Hurst attempts to give a comprehensive 
view of nineteen centuries of Christian history 
in a space equal to that which Dr. Moeller re- 
quires for setting forth six centuries. To the 
early Church, Dr. Hurst assigns a century and 
a half more than Dr. Moeller, and devotes 102 
pages. His avowed purpose is to popularize 
the study of religious history. The qualifying 
part of the title to his work, in such a case, is 
made important. The author frankly tells us 
how he has prepared this volume. Its five di- 
visions are a careful re-arrangement and re- 
writing of five short histories by which he is 
already known to a certain class of readers. 
In the re-arrangement and re-writing, it seems 
to have escaped the author's attention that the 
rather confused view of a very disorganized 
Christianity presented in the latter part of his 
volume is wholly inconsistent with the defini- 
tion of the visible Church with which he sets 
out. " The visible Church," says he, " con- 
sists of the organized believers in Christ and 
the followers of his life." We should be jus- 
tified in expecting a " short history " of the 
Christian Church to keep this definition in 
view, so that the Church might be clearly iden- 
tified in every period of its history. Certain 
phrases used by the author, e. g., " the Evan- 
gelical Protestant Church," "Evangelical Chris- 
tianity," and " the aggressive sisterhood of Pro- 
testant Churches," imply a reaching out after 
a term which shall be comprehensive of 
something, and yet non-committal as to the 
theories of the visible Church held by Latin or 



Anglican theologians ; though he repeatedly 
makes the blunder, common among ultra-Pro- 
testant writers, of calling the Church of Rome, 
its adherents, and its principles, " Catholic," 
a sweeping concession of every claim the Church 
of Rome makes. The author would have avoided 
many difficulties in the way of writing a short 
history of the Church from his standpoint, had 
he entitled his work a " Short History of Chris- 
tianity." The chapters in the fifth division of 
his volume, devoted to a score or more of fan- 
tastic sects in no sense connected with the 
Church as he defines it, would not then appear 
so incongruous. 

An accurate terminology, however, does not 
seem to be a strong point with this distinguished 
writer. The words " sect " and " schism " are 
used as though convertible terms. " Theo- 
tokos " is defined as " God-born " on page 52, 
and as " Mother of God " on page 386. The 
term " Roman Catholic " is used under circum- 
stances which render it utterly meaningless. 
We are seriously told that, at a certain period 
of his life, Luther was " a firm and full believer 
in the one Roman Catholic Church." Again (p. 
247) " Henry's [VIII.] real purpose was a Na- 
tional Roman Catholic Church with himself at 
the head "; and (p. 262) mention is made of 
the desire of the French " for a National Ro- 
man Catholic Church." How such combina- 
tions of antagonistic Church polities could pos- 
sibly have been accomplished, even in the mind 
of a theorist, it would be interesting to know. 
Furthermore, omitting all reference to the ori- 
gin of the term " Protestant " (a serious omis- 
sion even in a short history of the Reforma- 
tion), and failing to define the same, it is 
applied long before the occasion for its use 
arose, and indiscriminately afterwards, even 
to a class of modern religionists of the Baltic 
Provinces who have been deprived of privi- 
leges which the Czar of Russia seems to have 
it in his power to restore. This confusion of 
terms appears to result from confused ideas on 
certain essential historical points. Be that as 
it may, it is sure to lead to confused ideas in 
those who would derive their historical inform- 
ation from this book. 

If " the Church of the Past " is to be made 
" a wise instructor for the Church of the Fu- 
ture," it is not only necessary that the events 
of history be accurately known by those who 
have the "true historical instinct," but also 
that they be accurately related. Granted that 
Dr. Hurst is not deficient in his knowledge of 
events, it is unfortunate that we should find 



38

him " nodding " so frequently when he comes 
to relate these events. We are surprised that 
some of the errors (of which we may cite the 
following as an example) should have evaded 
detection. It was not to escape the general 
persecution under Herod Agrippa, A. D. 44, 
that " the Christians took refuge in Pella, be- 
yond the Jordan " (p. 17), but in immediate 
anticipation of the destruction of Jerusalem 
by the armies of Titus, A. D. 70. That im- 
portant event is altogether erroneously nar- 
rated in the sentences immediately following 
the statement we have just corrected : 

" Bar-cochba led a final popular Jewish revolt against 
the Roman authority, A. D. 132, but was defeated by 
Julius Sever us, and Jerusalem became a heap of ruins. 
The Roman emperor Hadrian tried to destroy the at- 
tachment of the Christians to the sacred associations of 
the city by erecting on Calvary a temple to Venus, and, 
over the Holy Sepulchre, a statue to Jupiter. But his ef- 
forts, while pleasing to the Jews, had no material effect." 

It is scarcely necessary to give a correct ac- 
count of these events, so well known is it to 
readers of history. It was the insult offered 
by Hadrian to the religion of the Jews, in set- 
tling a Roman colony on the site of the Holy 
City which had been destroyed sixty-two years 
previously, that incited the revolt of Bar- 
cochba. Hadrian's establishment of the city 
of ^Elia Capitolina on the foundations of Jer- 
usalem, and a temple of Jupiter on Mount Zion, 
were very far from pleasing to the Jews, and 
to the Roman city the Christians, who had been 
expelled by Titus, were freely admitted with 
the first of their Gentile Bishops. 

The utility of the work is seriously marred 
by omissions, of which a long list might be 
given. The organized existence of the Church 
of England in the fourth century, independent 
of the See of Rome, having been frankly ad- 
mitted, the means by which Rome gained the 
supremacy, the continued protests of the Church 
of England against the same, and the part 
taken by that Church in the Reformation, are 
entitled to some attention. A paragraph is cer- 
tainly inadequate treatment of the Council of 
Trent, even in a short history, and the omis- 
sion of all mention of the Creed of Pius IV., 
and the consequent failure to define modern 
Romanism, are scarcely excusable. In rela- 
tion to the Vatican Council of 1869 (which the 
author incautiously concedes to have been oacu- 
menical), a magnificent opportunity for a clear 
statement of the decree of Infallibility is ig- 
nored. Such a statement would have con- 
veyed information on a subject often referred 
to but popularly little known. 



The suggestion of so many omissions might 
be taken to imply that the work should have 
been extended at the cost of its qualified title. 
On the contrary, however, the book would have 
been greatly improved by a regard for the 
rules of proportion, and the consequent omis- 
sion of much of its present contents. The ref- 
erences to hymnody are so filled with errors and 
are so inadequate, and a half-dozen or so chap- 
ters upon Missions, Religious Literature, and 
cognate subjects are so partial, that the space 
they occupy might have been used to better 
advantage in the treatment of more important 
historical subjects. The author's prefatory 
misgivings regarding his treatment of the vari- 
ous American denominations are well founded, 
and suggest that the considerable portion of 
Part V., devoted to not very satisfactory 
sketches of about thirty different denomina- 
tions, might have been profitably replaced by 
a comprehensive view of Christianity in Amer- 
ica. A general re-arrangement of the chap- 
ters would have been of great advantage. The 
present derangement (of which let this serve 
as a sample : In Part II., Arnold of Brescia is 
treated of in Chapter XVI., Abelard, who was 
his teacher, is treated of in Chapter XXVIII.) 
is calculated to mislead readers as to the chron- 
ological order of the events narrated. 

If we have been somewhat explicit in point- 
ing out the shortcomings of this work, it is be- 
cause we agree with the author, " that the pop- 
ular taste for the condensed treatment of the 
secular sciences can be safely applied to the 
domain of Theological Science, and to no de- 
partment with greater hope of success than to 
Historical Theology." We regret, however, 
that this book falls far short of. serving that 
popular taste as it should, and fails of being 
of educational value to the constantly increas- 
ing number of students of Church History. 

Mr. Cole's contribution to ecclesiastico-his- 
torical literature, " The Anglican Church," is 
a monograph with a definite aim in view, 
thereby giving it a decided advantage over the 
much more pretentious works above reviewed. 
It is a modest duodecimo of 110 pages, con- 
taining a catena of proofs of the facts implied 
in the title, viz. that the Christian Faith was 
early introduced into the British Isles and has 
been continuously maintained therein. Its ar- 
gument is for the identity of the present Church 
of England with the organized Church which 
Dr. Hurst admits was represented at the Coun- 
cil of Aries. It is an argument against both 
Romanists and Protestants, who, in the face of

such historic facts as Magna Charta, refer the 
origin of the English Church to the time of 
Henry VIII. The book has all the elements 
of popularity save one. Its arguments are too 
convincing to meet with favor from those whose 
minds are made up against the claims of the 
Church of England to Catholicity limited only 
by nationality. ARTHUR HOWARD NOLL. 



THE "HERO OF NEW ORLEANS" AND 
"OLD ROUGH AND READY."* 



The second and third volumes of the " Great 
Commanders " series give sympathetic and in- 
spiring biographies of General Zachary Taylor 
and General Andrew Jackson. As the name 
implies, this series has a different purpose from 
that of the " American Statesmen Series," even 
when, as in the case of Jackson, a biography 
of the same man appears in each series. This 
difference in purpose sufficiently appears from 
examination of the two lives of Jackson, when 
it is found that Professor Sumner, who wrote 
the volume in the " Statesmen " series, has de- 
voted only 72 pages out of 386 to the events 
in the General's life previous to 1824, when he 
first ran for President, while Mr. Parton, in 
the volume in the " Great Commanders " se- 
ries, gives 272 pages out of 326 to the same 
period. The life of General Taylor follows a 
similar plan, and it will be readily seen that this 
difference in purpose makes the later series one 
which appeals strongly to boys and young men. 

Andrew Jackson, the intolerant and vol- 
canic, but intensely patriotic, honest, and in- 
domitable man, is made to live again in Mr. 
Parton's pages. From the days of '76, when 
as a boy prisoner he was struck to the ground 
with a sword by a British officer for refusing 
to black his captor's boots, through stormy 
years of service as public prosecutor in the un- 
tamed days of early Tennessee, day by day 
amidst the difficulties of conducting a success- 
ful campaign, with the aid of a half-starved 
and mutinous army, against the Indians of 
Alabama, in perpetual warfare with weakness 
and pain in his own body, through the awful 
carnage of New Orleans, and finally upon the 
no less stormy if less bloody political field of 
Calhoun and Webster's day, Andrew Jackson

the man stands forth as the only adequate ex- 
planation of Andrew Jackson the general and 
statesman. His faults are not covered up or 
explained away, and a boy must see them as 
faults ; but the essential greatness and manli- 
ness of his character and achievements are so 
clearly shown that, in spite of faults, he must 
be a rare American youth who can read these 
pages without feeling a healthful stimulus to 
his own manliness and patriotism. 

In 1812, a year before General Jackson 
took terrible revenge upon the Creeks for the 
massacre of Fort Minis, Captain Zachary Tay- 
lor, then a young man of twenty-eight years, 
serving under General William Henry Harri- 
son, made such a gallant defense of Fort Har- 
rison against a superior force of Indians led 
by the Prophet, Tecumseh's brother, that his 
superior in his despatches to Washington 
warmly praised him. From that time on, and 
indeed for some time previously, in Indiana, 
Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Florida (where 
Jackson had once been a campaigner and Gov- 
ernor), in Texas at Palo Alto and Resaca de 
la Palma, beyond the Rio Grande at Mata- 
moras, and finally at Monterey and Buena 
Vista, another American commander was slowly 
fitting himself for greater deeds and heavier 
responsibilities by quietly " doing his duty." 
The evolution of the sturdy old soldier and pa- 
triotic American is lovingly traced by Major- 
General O. O. Howard. Here, as in the life 
of Jackson, the man himself is introduced to 
us and we share his tent. The contrast be- 
tween the two men is striking. One is impet- 
uous, intolerant, radical, the other is poised, 
generous, and conservative. And yet, when 
need was, the aggressive boldness and uncon- 
querable will of "Old Rough and Ready" 
were not surpassed even by the " Hero of New 
Orleans." 

The civic life of Taylor is briefly but ade- 
quately told. Special prominence is given to 
his attitude toward the slavery agitation of that 
day. We are told that when, in 1850, the 
President was approached by Southern leaders 
to get him to join in their plan to, set up a 
southern confederacy with him as President, 
Taylor replied with true Jacksonian vigor and 
effectiveness that he would put down such an 
attempt " with Southern volunteers." In Gen- 
eral Howard's opinion, this answer postponed 
the " irrepressible conflict " ten years and made 
the ultimate success of the Union cause possible. 

A good map of the battlefield of New Or- 
leans is given in the life of Jackson, and ex-

cellent maps of the Texas and Mexican battles 
are found in the other volume ; but a few good 
general maps, covering the whole field of mil- 
itary movements described, would add to the 
reader's interest and profit. The volumes are 
well indexed. HENRY W. THURSTON. 



RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY.* 



It seems odd to begin an article upon " Recent 
Books of Poetry" with a paragraph devoted to 
" Poems by Two Brothers." That modest collec- 
tion of youthful exercises in verse, now reproduced 
(as to title-page and arrangement) in fac-simile, is 
mainly useful in enabling us to realize the immense 
range of the conquests of Victorian Poetry. The 
year of its publication (1827 ) was also that of the 
appearance of Pollok's " Course of Time," mark- 
ing the lowest ebb of the tide of dull eighteenth- 
century didacticism. Meanwhile, the romantic move- 
ment had swelled to its height, and its force was 
fast becoming spent. But who could have dis- 
cerned, in the volume almost furtively put forth by 
three English schoolboys (for Mr. Frederick Ten- 
nyson wrote at least four of the poems), the first 
wave of a new tide of song, about to gather to itself 
the best impulses of both the didactic and romantic 
spirits, to unite them in one resistless surge, and 
destined to sweep down the century almost to its 
very close. Even now, when judgment can hardly

avoid the influence of the accomplished fact, it is 
difficult to find in this volume any suggestion, much 
less any promise, of what was to come. Here and 
there we find a faintly Tennysonian phrase, such as 

" Groves of undulating pine, 
Upon whose heads the hoary vapours hung," 

or this : The tnun( j er of the Drazen prows 

O'er Actium's ocean rang," 
or this : 

" A wan, dull, lengthen'd sheet of swimming light 
Lies the broad lake." 

But what we find for the most part are the plati- 
tudes of boyish rhetoric, and echoes of Byron or 
Moore. It is amusing to think that any work signed 
by Alfred Tennyson should deserve no better de- 
scription than is given by the phrase, " an echo of 
Moore." Four pieces not included in the original 
edition are now first published from manuscript. 
They enrich English literature by such measures as 

41 Fare thee well ! for I am parting 
To the realms of endless bliss ; 
Why is thus thy full tear starting ? 
There's a world more bright than this." 

" Timbuctoo," the prize poem of 1829, which the 
publishers have also added to the collection, is a dif- 
ferent matter. Here we can find our own Tennyson 
in many passages. The following has often been 
quoted, but is worth quoting again : 

" The clear galaxy 
Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful, 
Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light, 
Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth 
And harmony of planet-girded suns 
And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel, 
Arch'd the wan sapphire." 

Indeed, the growth in power of poetic expression 
that is evidenced by these and many other lines of 
" Timbuctoo," when compared with the best of the 
" Poems by Two Brothers," is one of the most 
striking things in all the record of the development 
of poetical genius. 

" King Poppy," a posthumous poem by the Earl 
of Lytton, was written nearly twenty years ago, and 
subjected, during the rest of the author's lifetime, 
to constant revision and improvement. It was the 
author's favorite work, and exhibits, at their highest 
stage of development, his considerable powers as a 
writer of philosophic and fanciful verse. In 1880, 
he wrote of the poem to this effect : 

" The purpose of it, so far as it has any definite purpose, is 
not to prove that all is vanity, but to suggest what a poor 
tissue of unreality human life would be if the much despised 
influence of the imagination were banished from it. I think 
that the practical tendency of all the most popular formulas 
of social and political improvement is to exclude the imagin- 
ative element from the development of character and society, 
and to ignore its influence. . . . Holding this view, it was a 
relief to me to write ' King Poppy,' and a sort of whimsical 
enjoyment to contemplate my own image of the perfection of 
government conducted by a puppet. Apart from this, the 
more purely literary idea I had in this poem was to shape out 
vaguely a sort of Golden Legend from the most venerable and 
familiar features or fragments of the fairy tales and ballads 
which float about the world, and which our wise generation 
relegates to the nursery." 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

We select the following lines from the introductory 
" Legend," as well representing the charm of the 
work in its more poetical passages : 

" There is a legend, the low-breathing wind 
In Spring-time whispers to the trees and flowers, 
That some good gift on every flower and tree 
A guardian god or goddess once bestow'd. 
Pan made the reed melodious : Artemis 
With mystic influence fill'd the moon-fern : Zeus 
The cypress, Cybele the pine, endow'd 
With solemn grace : blithe Dionysus pour'd 
The strength of his indomitable mirth 
Into the sweet orbs of the cluster'd vine : 
Ethereal azure from Athene's eyes 
The dim veins of the violet imbued 
With pensive beauty : Cythereia's kiss 
Crimson'd the balmy bosom of the rose : 
Leaf of unfading lustre Phoabus gave 
To the green laurel : washt in Herd's milk, 
White shone the immaculate lily : and the ripe corn 
Demeter robed in oriental gold." 

" The Eloping Angels " is entirely unworthy of 
Mr. Watson's talents. That the author of " Words- 
worth's Grave " should have wasted his time in the 
composition of a skit like this is simply amazing, 
and that he should have heen willing to give it pub- 
lication is still more amazing. The piece is evi- 
dently intended to he semi-humorous, but the hu- 
mor is elephantine, and the author's wit nearly 
always misses fire. Humor that does not warm and 
wit that does not illuminate, are things " most tol- 
erable and not to be endured." The best comment 
upon the work is provided by its own text: 

" This sort of prank, to me, is rather tame." 
Mr. Watson's good work is so very good that it is 
doubly a pity that he should publish anything so 
far below the level of his better self. 

Mr. T. E. Brown, the author of "Old John and 
Other Poems," is at least no imitator of other 
men's work. His manner, freakish to eccentricity, 
is all his own, although a superficial view might 
find it to resemble the manner of Browning. Much 
of his verse is too utterly formless to deserve seri- 
ous consideration, and yet there often emerges from 
the seeming chaos some ethical message that is 
startling in its directness and its force. We also 
note in his work a vein of mysticism that is not 
without impressiveness. As an illustration of the 
author's more eccentric manner, we may take some 
very original verses from a poem which preaches 
upon a frequently recurring theme that of the 
need of man's soul to get back to nature, to escape 
from the coil of a complex civilization and the 
sophistications of art. 

" The main purport of our earthly station, 
Which is to permeate 
One soul with fullest freight 
Of constant natural forms, not factual complication. 

" Else were our life both frivolous and final. 

A mere skiomachy, 
Not succulent of growth, not officinal 

To what shall after be, 

But Fortune's devilry 
Of Harlequin with smirk theatro-columbinal." 

" Israel and Hellas " is the title of one of the finer 



poems in the collection. It contrasts the two civ- 
ilizations much as Matthew Arnold was wont to do, 
although our later poet half doubts if the contrast 
were as great as it appears to us. We quote four 
stanzas that embody the central thought of the poem. 

" And was it possible for them to hold 

A creed elastic in that lightsome air, 
And let sweet fables droop in flexile fold 

From off their shoulders bare, 
Loose-fitting, jewel-clasped with fancies rare ? 

" For not as yet intense across the sea 

Came the swart Hebrew with a fiery haste ; 

In long brown arms entwined Euphrosyne, 
And round her snowy waist 

Fast bound the Nessus-robe, that may not be displaced. 

" Yes, this is true ; but the whole truth is more ; 

This was not all the burning Orient gave ; 
Through purple partings of her golden door 

Came gleams upon the wave. 
Long shafts that search the souls of men who crave ; 

" And probings of the heart, and spirit-balm, 
And to deep questionings the deep replies 
That echo in the everlasting calm 

All this from forth those skies, 
Beside Gehenna fire and worm that never dies." 

There is a large philosophy of life embodied in some 
of Mr. Brown's pieces, the stanzas to " Pain " offer- 
ing a notable illustration. They open thus : 

" The man that hath great griefs I pity not ; 
'Tis something to be great 
In any wise, and hint the larger state, 
Though but in shadow of a shade, God wot ! 

" Moreover, while we wait the possible, 
This man has touched the fact, 
And probed till he has felt the core, where, packed 
In pulpy folds, resides the ironic ill." 

This is the close of the poem : 

" But tenfold one is he, who feels all pains 
Not partial, knowing them 
As ripples parted from the gold-beaked stem 
Wherewith God's galley onward ever strains. 

" To him the sorrows are the tension-thrills 
Of that serene endeavor 
Which yields to God forever and forever 
The joy that is more ancient than the hills." 

This is the deeper optimism that we find in Brown- 
ing, or in Carlyle's doctrine that not happiness but 
blessedness is the true aim of life. Enough has been 
said to show that Mr. Brown's work will repay study, 
that within its husks there may be found a sweet 
and nutritious kernel. 

The past year has brought many contributions of 
verse to its central Columbian theme, verse that has 
ranged all the way from the wooden epics of Mr. 
Kinahan Cornwallis to the lyrical measures of Miss 
Monroe's " Commemoration Ode." Mr. Louis 
James Block is the latest contributor to this Colum- 
bian literature, and his work takes the form of a 
sort of versified Culturgeschichte, having the dis- 
covery of America for its main episode. In spite 
of a few defects a defective line now and then or 
an imperfect rhyme, an archaism or a verbal li- 
cense that occasionally goes beyond the limits of 
the admissible, a mysticism and a vagueness of ex-

pression that sometimes lapses into obscurity, in 
spite of these things, we think that Mr. Block has 
produced a very noble poem, a poem not unworthy 
of its great theme, and that stands in eloquent con- 
trast to many efforts that we will not for a moment 
draw from kindly oblivion by naming. Mr. Block's 
poem is in four sections " The Old World," " The 
Man," "The Deed," and "The New World" 
with a dedication to the "Women of America." 
The first and last sections, with their poetic charac- 
terization of the supreme moments of history, show 
the author's work at its best, for they afford him 
the most opportunities for the fine philosophical gen- 
eralizations towards which he is led by his natural 
bent. As an illustration of this, as well as of the 
complex structure of the whole poem, we quote the 
stanza which sums up the part of India in the his- 
tory of ancient culture : 

" Under the fervid skies, and mid the growth 
Of tangled forests where the mountains vast 
Circle the shaded glens, a gloomy past 
Enwraps a nobler people ; ever loth 
To grasp the present firmly, seeing both 

The worlds of earth and heaven in mist of dreams 
Enrobed and mingled, they seemed bound by oath 
Of high allegiance to the One who gleams 
Recedingly on the gaze 
Turned Himwards ; by what ways 
Of severence from the body, down what streams 
Of anguish did they seek Him ; the land teems 
With monstrous shapes and visions that enthrall ; 
And chiefly thee, Buddh, the foiled ones call 
Savior and friend, thee clothed in contemplation's rest, 
And finding loss of all and nothingness the best." 

Felicitous passages abound in the poem. 

" People grown strong with very sight of God," 
gives admirable expression to the ethical mission of 
the Hebrew. 

" Freedom awoke with Greece, 

And violet-crowned peace ; 
The soul was born and thought's first victory won," 

is both exquisite and adequate. The following fine 
tribute is paid to England : 

" stern-browed Heroine far across the sea, 

Your daughter knows your blood within her veins, 
And hearkens to the ever-ringing strains 
Your voice has poured to honor liberty." 

Indeed, the whole poem is a song of the conquests 
of liberty, and closes in a vein that seems inspired 
by Shelley's outburst : 

" Oh, happy earth, reality of heaven ! " 
" One vision more ! " sings the author, 

" One vision more ! the spiritual city lies 
Beneath the sun ; the all-subduing love 
Inhabits there as in the realms above ; 
As lordly as the blue unclouded skies 
Life passes, and the mighty dawn's surmise 

Reaches completion, and the deeps on deeps 
Of spirit which are seen alone of eyes 

Whose watch is kin to power that never sleeps 
Are more and more revealed ; 
The inmost heavens unsealed 
Comfort the heart where no more anguish weeps, 
And open fields which faith forever reaps." 

The dramatic element, rather than the lyrical, is 
the characteristic component of Mr. Fawcett's 



" Songs of Doubt and Dream." The best of the 
poems are those either dramatic in form, as " Two 
Scenes in the Life of Beau Brummell," or in spirit, 
as the fine narrative of " Queen Christina and De 
Liar." Hence we question the propriety of speci- 
fically styling the volume a collection of songs. The 
spontaneous grace and melody of the true lyric are 
qualities rarely exhibited in Mr. Fawcett's verse, 
but we have instead abundant energy devoted to a 
wide range of themes. We are inclined to think that 
the author has weighted his verse with more phil- 
osophy than it will bear, or rather, perhaps, that 
his philosophy has not been sublimed in the proper 
alembic ; it is often crude and merely prosaic in 
expression. The memorial verses to Courtlandt 
Palmer are excellent in thought and sympathy, yet 
we can hardly call poetry such lines as these : 

" Ye men that bow to science as your god 
Learn self-control and patience from her laws. 
Remember Newton and Copernicus 
Killed superstition with the sword of truth ; 
They did not scare it dead with rhetoric ; 
Hysteria never framed a syllogism, 
And logic murders like a gentleman." 

The " dream " of Mr. Fawcett's title, as well as the 
" doubt," is justified by many pieces, from which 
we select, as among the more successful, " A Retro- 
spect." 

" Wandering where mortals have no power to gauge 

The enormity of night that space outrolls, 
Floated or paused, in shadowy pilgrimage, 

Two disembodied souls. 

" One towered a shape with dark wild-trailing shroud, 
With face by sorrow and anger seamed and drawn ; 

One loomed a holy glory, as when some cloud 
Swims deep in baths of dawn. 

" World after world they gazed on, till beguiled 
They flew toward earth, and hovering where she swept, 

One with a saturnine dejection smiled, 
And one with slow tears wept. 

"'On that star,' said the spirit of sombre mien, 
' As Dante I passed through pain's most blinding heats. . . . 

' On that star,' said the spirit of look serene, 
' I suffered, and was Keats.' " 

There are in these lines echoes of Tennyson and 
Aldrich, at least, and the felicity of several words 
(guage, enormity, loomed, dejection) may be ques- 
tioned, but the poem has merits, and is not unim- 
pressive. We have found nothing prettier or more 
nearly faultless in the volume than this " Aqua- 
relle": 

" Far away westward the cattle go, 

Dotting the land's dim edges ; 
Isled in the roseate afterglow, 

Darken the long cloud-ledges. 

" Burning each moment with warmer beams, 

Moon, by your sweet chaste power 
Lull the world into lotus-dreams, 
While you hang like a lotus-flower." 

On the whole, Mr. Fawcett's volume comprises the 
best work in verse that he has yet given us, and 
fairly entitles him to a place among our American 
poets of the second rank.

THE DIAL 



43 



Mr. Cawein's new volume has the general charac 
teristics of its predecessors the cloying imagery 
and the verbal trickery; but we hear at times a 
stronger note than he has been wont to sound, a 
graver, if a no less passionate, strain. There is stil 
too much of this sort of thing : 

" Fly out with flirt and fluting 

As flies a falling- star 
From flaming star-beds shooting, 
From where the roses are," 

but there are also verses like these : 

" Once when the morning on the curling breakers, 

Along the foaming sand, 
Flashed expectation, by the ocean's acres, 
Love took command. 

"And so we sailed, ^Eolian music melting 

Around our silken sails ; 

The bubbled foam our prow of sandal pelting 
With rainbow gales." 

Mr. Cawein's Muse, in her less exuberant moods, 
gives promise of excellent things. 

One does not expect very much from undergrad- 
uate college verse. " Under the Scarlet and Black " 
is perhaps deserving of a word of mention as the 
first book of verse that has yet hailed from a West- 
ern college, for the collection comes to us from 
Grinnell, Iowa. The honors of the volume are 
borne off by Miss Mary Bowen and Miss Bertha 
Booth (both of this year's class), and, after some 
hesitation, we select a piece by the former writer 
a sonnet " To Emily Dickinson ": 
" A harp ^Eolian on a lonely sill 

Was placed to feel the subtle wind's soft touch. 
Perhaps its strains were burdened overmuch 
With Nature's sadness and her discords ; still, 
Responsive to its master's touchless thrill, 
It told the clover's whisper to the breeze, 
The wordless plaint of wind-swept winter trees, 
With melody unknown to human skill. 
So in the quiet of a life apart 

From other lives, their passion and their pain, 
The hand of Nature touched thy tuue'd heart, 

And, lo, thou utterest in simple strain 
A song too thought-rich for a fettered art, 
Yet bearing ever Nature's sad refrain." 

Professor Newton M. Hall introduces the volume 
with a brief sketch of journalism in Iowa College. 
We have hardly found anything as good as the 
above sonnet in " Cap and Gown," although Mr. 
J. L. Harrison, the editor, has chosen his contents 
from some forty college papers. Most of his pieces 
are love lyrics of a somewhat callow sort, written 
in the exotic verse-forms that seem so easy, yet 
in which real success is reached only by the mas- 
ters. The verses to Eleanor," by Mr. J. H. Boyn- 
ton, are perhaps as successful as anything in the 
collection. 

" I do not think she loves me yet, 

Her glance meets mine direct and free ; 
Its very sweetness seems to set 
A bar between herself and me. 

" I never touched her lips with mine, 

I dare not dream I ever may ; 
Still when I come her eyes will shine, 
And soften when I go away. 



"Some hours I cannot well forget, 

Perhaps she may remember too. 
I knew I loved her when we met, 
She never seemed as others do. 

" I loved to watch her flushing cheek, 

Her soft hair carelessly astray, 
To see her smile, to hear her speak, 
And still have loved her every day. 

" I do not think she loves me yet, 

I dare not think she ever may ; 
I know I loved her when we met, 
And still have loved her every day." 

The binding of this volume, with its hydrangea- 
decorated covers, is original and exquisite enough 
to call for a special word of praise. 

^ The title-page of " Under King Constantine " 
gives us no author's name, but we understand the 
authorship of the book has been acknowledged by 
Mrs. Spencer Trask. Mrs. Trask has undertaken 
the hazardous experiment of writing Arthurian idyls, 
and her little volume comprises three such poems 
narratives expanded from hints in Malory. A 
passage describing the vision of the Grail will show 
the character of the verse : 

" One night at midnight came the ray again, 
And with it came a strange expectancy 
Of spirit as the light waxed radiant. 
The cell was filled with spicy odours sweet, 
And on the midnight stillness song was borne 
As sweet as heaven's harmony the words 
The same Sir Launcelot had heard of old 

' Honour and joy be to the Father of Heaven.' 
With wide eyes searching his lone cell for cause 
He waited : as the ray became more clear 
And more effulgent than the mid-day sun, 
He trembled with that chill of mortal flesh 
Beholding spiritual things. At last 
Now vaguely as though veiled by light, and then 
With shining clearness, perfectly he saw 
The sight unspeakable, transcending words." 

The purpose of Mrs. Trask's verse is serious and 
sincere, but the execution is amateurish, and an ex- 
tremely qualified praise is all that can be given the 
volume. 

Mr. Richard Hovey's " Seaward " is an elegy, in 
forty-five seven-line stanzas, upon the late Thomas 
William Parsons. It is elaborate in construction 
and extremely discursive in treatment. We quote 
one of the stanzas : 

' But who is this that from the mightier shades 
Emerges, seeing whose sacred laureate hair 

Thou startest forward trembling through the glades, 
Advancing upturned palms of filial prayer? 

Long hast thou served him ; now, of lineament 
Not stern but strenuous still, thy pious care 

He comes to guerdon. Art though not content ? " 

Dne of Mr. Hovey's notes obligingly informs us that 
,he reference of this passage is to Dante. A study 

of Parsons, reprinted from " The Atlantic Monthly," 

serves, with the notes, to thicken the booklet into 

what may be called a volume. 

Professor William Hyde Appleton, of Swarth- 

more College, has made and annotated a collection 
f translated passages of Greek poetry, naming the 

volume " Greek Poets in English Verse," and sup-

plying an introduction of no great value. The in- 
troduction, in fact, is little more than a summary 
of the Homeric poems and three or four selected 
tragedies. It is not noticeably critical, and lapses 
into the style sophomoric. We may remark inci- 
dentally that " deeper than ever plummet sounded " 
is not a quotation from any author known to us. 
Mr. Appleton's volume is intended as an aid to the 
"classical course in English " of which overmuch is 
nowadays heard from university extension lecturers. 
The idea of such courses is an excellent one, pro- 
vided only they fall into the right hands, but the 
attempts thus far made to give them seem to have 
been unfortunate. Mr. Appleton's selections include 
copious extracts from Homer and the four dram- 
atists, and many short passages from the lyric and 
elegiac poets and the Anthology. We are aware 
that in any work of this sort much allowance should 
be made for the tastes of the compiler, and that no 
collector of elegant extracts (not even Mr. Pal- 
grave ) ever quite satisfied all his readers. But Mr. 
Appleton has missed so many of the things that 
ought to have gone into his book that we must ven- 
ture a word of unfavorable comment. His fear 
" that some one of his readers may miss the very 
thing that he hopes to find " is only too well war- 
ranted, for is it possible that any reader should not 
have hoped and confidently expected to find, in 
the Homeric section, Lord Tennyson's "Achilles 
over the French "? "Language as divine almost 
as Homer's own," Mr. Theodore Watts calls it, and 
whatever else was omitted, surely that ought not to 
have been. Another omission as conspicuous is 
that of Mr. Swinburne's translation of the chorus 
from the " Birds." Compared with that, all other 
translations from Aristophanes (even Mr. Lang's 
version of the ' Clouds ' chorus ) are simply nowhere. 
When we add that neither the " Agamemnon " of 
Browning or of Fitz Gerald is represented, and that 
Calverley's " Theocritus " is wholly ignored, we feel 
justified in asserting that Mr. Appleton's work is 
not done as well as it should have been. 

The late John Osborne Sargent, lawyer and 
journalist, was a life-long lover of Horace, and a 
man singularly fitted by temperament to sympa- 
thize with the Horatian point of view. During the 
last ten years of his life, he devoted his leisure 
hours to the translation of his favorite poet, and the 
work, which includes all but a dozen or so of the 
odes, is now published by his daughter, Dr. Oliver 
Wendell Holmes contributing an introduction. The 
volume must be reckoned among the best of the 
many attempts to perform the alluring but diffi- 
cult task of Horatian translation. Mr. Sargent 
commands a variety of metrical forms, and his 
most satisfactory work is done in the grave iambic 
measures chosen for the more serious of the odes. 
We may take as an example the " Exegi monnmen- 
tum sere perennius ": 

"A monument more durable than brass 
Of height no regal pyramids surpass, 



I have achieved a work that will outlast 

The waste of waters or the northern blast. 

I shall not wholly die, but much of me, 

My better part shall reach posterity. 

No flight of seasons shall obscure my name, 

But serial ages shall increase my fame. 

While to the Capitol, to Time's last day, 

Pontiff and vestal tread the sacred way, 

It shall be told of one of humble birth, 

Now potent with the magnates of the earth 

Bred where he heard Ofanto's torrent roar, 

When Daunus' subjects ploughed its arid shore 

That he first wed to him that praise belongs 

^Eolian measures to Italian songs. 

With guerdon crown desert, Melpomene, 

And give the Delphic laurel wreath to me." 

If Mr. Sargent's versions are often inadequate, they 
are at least never undignified or lacking in either 
taste or feeling. He has fairly escaped the beset- 
ting sin of many Horatian translators that of vul- 
garizing their original. 

Mr. James Rhoades, whose version of books 
I. VI. of the " ^neid " has just appeared, apol- 
ogizes for adding another to the already numerous 
translations of Virgil (" Vergil " he styles the poet), 
and says : " It has seemed to me that, if one could 
produce a version of the ' ^Eneid ' that should be 
in itself an English poem, and at the same time a 
faithful reflection of the original, neither adding to 
the text nor diminishing from it, such an achieve- 
ment would be worth the time and labor required 
for the task." This is, indeed, the whole problem, 
and we are bound to say that Mr. Rhoades has been 
one of the most successful of those who have en- 
deavored to solve it. We make a brief extract from 
the prophecy of the sixth book. 

" Here is Caesar, here 
The whole line of lulus, that thall pass 
One day beneath the mighty pole of heaven. 
This, this the man so oft foretold to thee, 
Caesar Augustus, a god's son, who shall 
The golden age rebuild through Latian fields 
Once ruled by Saturn, and push far his sway 
O'er Garamantians and the tribes of Ind, 
A land that lies beyond the stars, beyond 
The year's path and the sun's, where, prop of heaven, 
Atlas upon his shoulders turns the pole, 
Studded with burning constellations." 

This is excellent verse, and the elevation is fairly 
sustained throughout the translation. 

Of the new edition of Coleridge, which we must 
dismiss with a word, the principal things to be said 
are that it offers a critical edition of the text alto- 
gether superior to any previously in existence, a 
compact and fairly exhaustive body of notes, and 
an introductory biography that must at once super- 
sede all others, and remain for an indefinite period 
the standard authority for the life of the poet. It 
is difficult to accord to Mr. Campbell's labors the 
praise that they deserve ; no previous editor of Cole- 
ridge has approached him either in knowledge or in 
painstaking industry. The memoir, we understand, 
is to be republished by itself, a compliment of which 
it is entirely worthy.

Mr. Leslie Stephen is a superbly 
Mr. Leslie Stephen v i gorous am i trenchant writer. He

belongs with Mr. John Morley to 
that younger school of English radicals who have 
discarded the rhetorical bravery of the poets and 
orators of the Revolution, have outgrown the nar- 
rowness and harshness of the original Bentham- 
ite, have supplemented will by evolution and added 
culture and the historic sense to Herbert Spencer. 
Their only fault is that they are at all times sweetly 
reasonable and on all topics hopelessly and irreme- 
diably right. Mr. Stephen has but one weakness 
a fondness for parson-baiting, an itching for the- 
ological polemic, a desire to do over again the work 
of Voltaire. He knows better. He has read his 
Matthew Arnold and his Renan, and is aware that 
for this gross work " Voltaire suffit" But at times 
the unregenerate blood grows hot within him, he 
" bites his thumb," he " remembers his everlasting 
blow," and sallies forth to confound the orthodox 
with " An Agnostic's Apology, and Other Essays " 
(Putnam). "Why," he passionately exclaims, 
" when no honest man will deny in private that 
every ultimate problem is wrapped in the profound- 
est mystery, do honest men proclaim in pulpits that 
unhesitating certainty is the duty of the most fool- 
ish and ignorant " ? Why, perhaps because, as 
Emerson says, " All the Muses and love and reli- 
gion hate these developments and will find a way 
to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor 
the secrets of the laboratory." And if this is so, 
what is the use of proving by irrefragable logic that 
the " scepticism of believers " is really more par- 
alyzing to progress than " scepticism about the shift- 
ing phantasmagoria of theology." What profits it 
to combat " the Higher Pantheism " by a demon- 
stration that the dreams of theologians are not more 
than half true while they last, and that if we will live 
in dreams we lose our firm grasp of realities ? Of 
what avail solemnly to analyze and refute Cardinal 
Newman's " Theory of Belief " ? Do any thinkers 
take seriously this "theory of belief," or its author, 
except as a " stylist " and a " grand old man " ? 
And, when all is said, will Mr. Stephen's seventy 
pages of close reasoning convince anybody who is 
not already satisfied with Arnold's quiet affirmation 
that " Cardinal Newman has accepted a solution 
which is, frankly speaking, impossible " ? The del- 
icate irony of Mr. Stephen's essay on " The Reli- 
gion of All Sensible Men " will delight the literary 
epicure. But will it induce one " sensible man " to 
come out if his interest bids him keep the peace ? 
Does it really bring us any nearer the solution of 
the painful questions of conscience started in Mr. 
Morley's " Compromise " ? The discussion of the 
entire problem of persecution in the essay on " Poi- 
sonous Opinions " is an admirable philosophic sup- 
plement to Mill's essay on " Liberty." But will it 
make it possible for the Professor of Psychology to 
deliver his whole thought in any chair in the United 



States or England ? But we are wrong. Supersti- 
tion and intolerance are always striving for the 
mastery of the world, and must be combated in 
many ways. The slow gentle solvents of Renan's 
irony, of Arnold's freely-playing consciousness, and 
of Mr. Paters's tolerant interest in all errors that 
assume picturesque forms, will not suffice. There 
will always be enough neutrals, lovers of peace and 
advocates of compromise and accomodation. And 
so, lest the conflict prove too unequal, the philosophic 
onlooker, accepting with a grimace the service of 
the vitriol of Voltaire and the bludgeon of Inger- 
soll, will gladly welcome the finely-tempered, keen, 
trenchant blade of Mr. Stephen.

some of the master's best-known dramas, condensed, 
revised, and slightly rearranged for the benefit of 
the earnest student." Herr Ibsen's later works are 
good game for the parodist, and Mr. Guthrie has 
made the most of his opportunities. One would 
have to be a very crabbed and uncompromising 
Ibsenite not to smile at these delightful burlesques, 
which touch with inimitable skill the weak spots of 
the works which they parody, and give humorous 
exaggeration to the points that most clearly lend 
themselves to satirical treatment. " Rosmersholm," 
A Doll Home," " Hedda Gabler," and The Wild 
Duck " are thus presented in revised forms, while 
in " Pill-doctor Herdal " we have " rather a rev- 
erent attempt to tread in the footprints of the Nor- 
wegian dramatist, than a version of any actually 
existing masterpiece." The author confesses that 
" his imitation is painfully lacking in the magnifi- 
cently impenetrable obscurity of the original, that 
the vein of allegorical symbolism is thinner through- 
out than it should be, and that the characters are 
not nearly as mad as persons invariably are in real 
life," but even with these drawbacks, " Pill-doctor 
Herdal " offers no lack of mirthful entertainment. 
We must find space for one illustrative extract. It 
should be premised that, after the death of Byg- 
mester Solness, his widow has married Dr. Herdal. 
Into their household enters Hilde Wangel (who 
turns out to be no other than Nora of "A Doll 
Home," emancipated at last), just as previously she 
had come into Solness's life. The scene we quote 
is between Herdal and his wife: 

"DR. HERDAL (drinks a glass of punch). You're right 
enough there. If I had not been called in to prescribe for 
Dr. Ryval, who used to have the leading practice here, I

At this juncture, Miss Wangel does ring at the bell, 
but what follows must be left to imagination, or 
found out by our readers for themselves.

Statistics of crime . . . J

the tfnited state*. (p utnam ) is to state and emphasize 

the alarming increase in the United States of our 
criminal and dependent classes. The ordinary 
reader will be led by his pages to conclude that our 
nation is fast going to ruin. Statistics of crime 
and poverty are given, which, on their face, show 
that vice is growing with tremendous rapidity and 
that destitution will soon become general. The 
author discusses the problems of intemperance, im- 
migration, our urban population, the negro race, 
and jails and poor-houses, in a way to multiply our 
fears rather than to enlighten us respecting causes 
and remedies. These are indeed great problems, 
worthy serious attention and in need of wise action. 
But while Mr. Boies is a gentleman of earnestness 
and experience, it is clear that he has no such skill 
in handling statistics as Mr. Carroll D. Wright, 
and no such scientific ability in studying social phe- 
nomena as Dr. Amos G. Warner. In some cases, 
he does not seem to understand the figures which 
he uses, while in other cases he indulges in careless 
statements. He shows that since 1850, criminals 
have increased three times as fast as our population. 
This is indeed what appears upon the face of re- 
turns. But it is evident that we are not three 
times as wicked a people as forty years ago ! When 
we look at the statistics more carefully, we see 
that the comparison is vitiated by several factors : 
(1) The criminal acts of the negro race are ex- 
cluded from the census of 1850, but included in 
that of 1890, a fact of great importance. ( 2 ) 
The census of 1890 was more thorough than that 
of 1850 along this line ; it not only reports the 
facts more accurately but it reports new classes of 
facts. So that conclusions based upon a literal 
comparison must be manifestly erroneous. (3) New 
laws and police regulations lead to arrests and 
convictions where acts would have been considered 
innocent forty years ago. Cruelty to animals and 
children caused few arrests then ; violations of san- 
itary regulations were unknown ; offences against 
public order, such as drunkenness and the selling of 
liquor ; all these and many other acts, like the pur- 
chase of lottery tickets, though innumerable, did not 
enter into our criminal records as at present. That 
our list of criminals has grown in this direction is 
evidence, not of our increasing depravity, but of our

in history. 



moral progress. We have more patients in hospi- 
tals than the Esquimo, but it does not follow that we 
are physically a more feeble people. Mr. Boies 
does not make any such discriminations, he only 
alludes to the fact respecting the negro race. These 
defects vitiate all his discussions of these problems, 
which are indeed great and serious problems. His 
incapacity in this line is farther shown by his use of 
a statement from Professor Ely to support his 
claim that there are three million paupers in the 
United States (p. 205), and by his astonishing as- 
sertion that there are 17,058 county jails in our 
country (p. 193). 

Mr. Morfill, among Englishmen, 
seems to have a monopoly of pro- 
duct on Slavonic subjects, in the field 
of history as well as of literature. He now gives 
to the " Story of the Nations " series a " Poland " 
(Putnam). No writer of English would seem bet- 
ter qualified for such a work, yet Mr. Morfill has 
hardly added to what one may get from an ency- 
clopaedia on this subject. His book is sketchy, and 
one ends it by wishing for a guide through the maze 
of aimless energy which it portrays. What one 
needs is an explanation of Poland's failure in his- 
tory, which Mr. Morfill does not give in his pages 
devoted to that purpose. An unpatriotic nobility, 
an intolerant clergy, a lacking middle class, and a 
degraded peasantry, were characteristics of all 
feudal states. That Poland did not change all this 
was not due solely to the fifth cause suggested the 
want of rulers of talent and energy, although a 
Louis Eleventh, a Henry Eighth, or a Ferdinand the 
Catholic, would have been a great blessing to Poland. 
But all these men had their opportunity only be- 
cause the principle of hereditary succession was al- 
ready established in their dominions. The curse 
and the ruin of Poland was an elective monarchy, 
which, as in the case of the Holy Roman Empire, 
made a feudal condition of anarchy possible long 
after the age of feudalism was gone by. The fail- 
ure of success of this volume is not due to a lack of 
knowledge, but to a lack of historical insight on the 
part of a man whose forte is linguistic. 

A readable and Many a guide for the amateur pho-

photographers. years, written either in the interest 
of the general public, or in that of some firm en- 
gaged in the manufacture of photographic materials. 
It has been left for Miss Alice French (Octave 
Thanet) to produce a book upon the subject which 
serves its readers not only as guide, but also as 
philosopher and friend. Every beginner in this 
intricate art knows how deep is at times the need 
of philosophy, and how consoling may be the min- 
istry of friendship. Miss French has pursued pho- 
tography through trials to triumphs ( as some of the 
pictures in her book clearly show), but she has not 
acquired the air of superiority that makes the suc- 
cessful amateur so cordially detested by all less sue-

cessful aspirants. A record of failure is often more 
helpful than a record of triumphant achievement, and 
Miss French, in her record, gives abundant evidence 
that she too is human, and no exception to the maxim, 
humanum errare est. In vivacious and unconven- 
tional language, she tells the reader of her early 
tribulations, of the pitfalls upon which stumbled her 
unwary feet, and of the methods and formulae in 
which she finally found salvation. Miss French's 
book is good, first, to read, and second, to keep at 
hand for practical guidance in all the stages of photo- 
graphic work. It is entitled " An Adventure in 
Photography " (Scribner). 



Appreciative 
chats on 
American artists. 



In a series of essays and sketches 
reprinted under the collective title, 
"Picture and Text" (Harper), Mr. 
Henry James chats appreciatively of the admirable 
group of artists Messrs. Abbey, Parsons, Millet, 
Bough ton, Reinhart, Sargent, etc. best known to 
many of us through the medium of " Harper's 
Magazine." The excellence, in point of illustra- 
tion, of American magazines is justly a matter of 
national pride one of the shining exceptions to 
which we refer the carping foreigner ; and it is 
well to learn something of leading personality and 
methods of the illustrators. Touching the illustra- 
tion of books and magazines in general, the author 
observes that it " may be said to have been born in 
our time, so far as variety and abundance are the 
signs of it ; or born, at any rate, the comprehensive, 
ingenious, sympathetic spirit in which we conceive 
and practise it. If the centuries are ever arraigned 
at some bar of justice to answer in regard to what 
they have given, of good or of bad, to humanity, 
our interesting age (which certainly is not open to 
the charge of having stood with its hands in its 
pockets) might perhaps do worse than put forth 
the plea of having contributed a fresh interest in 
' black and white.' " The little book, which con- 
tains several illustrations, is a companion volume 
in the " Black and White Series " to Mr. Curtis's 
" From the Easy Chair," Mr. Warner's " As We 
Were Saying," etc. Of Mr. James's quality as an 
essayist we need not speak. Even those who do 
not care for him must admit his painstaking fidel- 
ity to his models ; and, at the worst, he may serve 
to sharpen the reader's appetite for a bit of down- 
right Anglo-Saxon. 



Interpretations 
of Tennyson's 



Mr. Harold Littledale's " Essays on 
Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King " 

Idylls of the King. /- MI \ v. j i 

(Macmillan) are based upon lec- 
tures written for students in India. It was cer- 
tainly worth while to offer the book in its present 
form to English and American students. Like 
other books prepared for the use of Indian under- 
graduates, this volume explains many things that 
any good dictionary could explain, but on the other 
hand it interprets many phases of the Idylls that 
no reference-book alludes to. There are chapters on 
the sources of the Arthurian story, on its growth from 



Malory to Tennyson, and on personages and localities 
spoken of in the modern epic. Then follow stud- 
ies of each Idyll, and annotations on particular words 
and obscure points. The work is by no means ex- 
haustive, but the material is carefully selected and 
well arranged. There is a constant comparison 
of Tennyson with Malory and the Mabinogion, and 
many interesting points of departure are suggested 
to the reader. The interpretation of the allegor- 
ical bearing of the Idylls is sensible and appreciat- 
ive, and the treatment of the rise of the legend, al- 
though brief, is in the main accurate. Rather 
strangely, however, Mr. Littledale takes no account 
of such an authoritative work as Professor Rhy's 
"Arthurian Legend." The work can readily be 
used as a handbook in a Tennyson class. 



A sailing-voyage 

from New York 
to Cape Town. 



" Undei> C ttOn Canva8 " 

is a lively account, with much inci- 
i a. i </ < M- 

dental " yarn-spinning, ot a sailing- 
voyage from New York to Cape Town, thence, over 
two hundred degrees of longitude, across the Indian 
and Pacific Oceans, to the coast of Chili, and from 
Chili to the Falkland Islands. The author, Cap- 
tain J. H. Potter, of the ship " Onward," observes in 
his Preface : " While Cooper, Marryatt, and others, 
have let the world know all about sailing before the 
day of steam, I know of no writer having yet come 
to the front to give anywhere near the correct idea 
of how it is with us, the ' wind-jammers,' since the 
introduction into our profession of that powerful 
element. This work was accordingly begun with 
the sole view of contributing towards the supply of 
that deficiency." A " wind-jammer," it may be 
said parenthetically, is a sailing-vessel, as contra- 
distinguished from a steamer. The story is told, 
as it should be told, for the most part, in an off- 
hand, breezy, sailor-like fashion, with plenty of in- 
cident, humorous as well as stirring. But oddly 
enough there is a tendency here and there to " work 
in," at all hazards, a tempting literary allusion or 
citation which results once or twice, where the 
connection is remote, in the Captain's getting his 
syntactical sails " all a-back and shaking," and nar- 
rowly escaping shipwreck. 

Mallet's " The French Revolution " 

A good summary 

of the French (ocribner), written by a lecturer on 
the staff of the Oxford University 
Extension for the " University Extension Manuals " 
series, may be thoroughly commended. It is the 
best summary of the Revolution yet published, and 
is a large improvement on the sketch by O'Connor 
Morris, also published by Messrs. Scribner. The 
author has availed himself of all the recent litera- 
ture of his subject down to Mr. Morse Stephens, and 
has not only summarized but has unified these con- 
tributions. His first two chapters clearly introduce 
the Revolution through its social causes, and he is 
very successful in showing why the Constitutional 
party failed, why the Jacobin party followed, and 
why the latter also failed. He ends his narrative

rightly with the thunder of Bonaparte's guns from 
the portals of St. Roch against the insurgent Sec- 
tions. His estimate of La Fayette is a compromise 
between the conventional one and the iconoclastic 
portrayal of Morse Stephens, and is probably near- 
est the truth. One may here trace briefly yet clearly 
the rapid sequence of causes and effects which 
Stephens alone of the more detailed historians has 
been able to keep above the surface of the multi- 
tudinous events narrated. As a text-book guide to 
the subject it must be highly praised. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



VOLUME IV. (just published) of "The Correspond- 
ence and Public Papers of John Jay " (Putnam) covers 
the dates between 1794 and 1826, thus completing the 
work that Professor Henry P. Johnston has edited with 
so much care. The volume opens with a letter from 
Jay to Dugald Stewart, " returning thanks for the gift 
of his ingenious work," and closes with the action of 
the New York Bar upon the occasion of Jay's death. 
There is also a very satisfactory index to the complete 
work. 

THE new edition of Murray's " Handbook for Trav- 
ellers in Japan " (imported by Scribner) has been 
almost wholly rewritten by Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain 
(than whom there is no higher authority), assisted by 
Mr. W. B. Mason. A thorough revision of the sort 
here accomplished was peculiarly necessary in the case 
of the present work, for the world moves rapidly in 
Japan, as if to make up for many centuries lost, and 
even the past decade has transformed many sections of 
the country. Generally speaking, we prefer a " Bae- 
deker " to a " Murray " for a guide-book, but the " Mur- 
ray " now before us is one of the very best of that im- 
print, and no English tourist in Japan can afford to be 
without it. 

SOME " Selections from the Writings of William 
Blake " (imported by Scribner) have been made by 
Mr. Laurence Housman, who also supplies them with 
an introductory essay that is labored and not altogether 
agreeable in manner. The selections include both prose 
and poetry; were it not for the prose extracts, its 
place would seem to have been filled by Mr. W. M. 
Rossetti's edition of the poems. Such a selection as 
this is all of Blake that is wanted by the great major- 
ity of readers, although the recent sumptuous publica- 
tion of his entire works shows that there exists at least 
a limited demand for the more chaotic productions of 
his unregulated genius. 

MR. Charles Frederick Holder's "Louis Agassiz" 
(Putnam), appearing in the " Leaders in Science " 
series, gives a very readable popular biography of the 
great naturalist. The work is illustrated, and has a 
useful bibliography. Two recent issues in " Whittaker's 
Library of Popular Science " (Macmillan) are " Geol- 
ogy*" by Mr. A. J. Jukes-Brown, and " Electricity and 
Magnetism," by Mr. S. R. Bottone. These books are 
of the most elementary description, but subserve a use- 
ful purpose. 

Six articles that originally appeared in " Scribner's 
Magazine " have been grouped in a volume entitled 
" Homes in City and Country " (Scribner). They in- 
clude " The City House in the East and South," by 



Mr. Russell Sturgis; "The City House in the West," 
by the late John W. Root; articles on "The Suburban 
House," " The Country House," and " Small Country 
Places"; closing somewhat incongruously with a chap- 
ter on " Building and Loan Associations." The book 
is provided with many handsome illustrations, and the 
" homes " with which it deals are for the wealthy. 

THE fact that Mr. H. F. Pelham's " Outlines of Ro- 
man History " (Putnam) is essentially a reprint of the 
" Encyclopaedia Britannica " article upon the subject 
stamps the work with the hall-mark of literary and schol- 
arly excellence. Many revisions and additions have, how- 
ever, been made to fit the article for reproduction as an in- 
dependent volume. The greater part of the work is 
given to the years 133 B. C. 69 A. D., from the Grac- 
chi to the fall of Nero. A useful list of authorities 
prefaces the book. 

Two recent volumes of the " Contemporary Science 
Series " (imported by Scribner) are " Modern Meteor- 
ology," a useful popular treatise by Mr. Frank Waldo, 
and " Public Health Problems," by Mr. John F. J. Sykes. 
The latter work treats its subject from a distinctly prac- 
tical standpoint, and includes valuable chapters upon 
the precautionary measures to be adopted in case of ep- 
idemics. Similar in interest to the work last mentioned 
is Dr. F. L. Dibble's " Vagaries of Sanitary Science " 
(Lippincott), a work which exposes many popular errors 
and throws much light upon the workings of sanitary 
officialism, as illustrated by State Boards of Health and 
the like. 



LITERARY NOTES A:NT> 



The Johns Hopkins Press will publish in September 
" Florentine Life during the Renaissance," by Dr. Wal- 
ter B. Scaife. 

" The Science of Mechanics," from the German of 
Professor Mach, will be published at once by the Open 
Court Publishing Co. 

The German papers announce a posthumous work 
by Hegel, entitled " Kritik der Verfassung Deutsch- 
lands," edited by Dr. G. Mollat. 

" The Shadow of the Obelisk, and Other Poems," by 
the late Dr. Parsons, will be published in the autumn 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Some announcements of the Century Co. are these: 
" The Public School System of the United States," by 
Dr. J. M. Rice; "An Embassy to Provence," by Mr. 
Thomas A. Janvier; " The White Islander," by Mrs. 
Catherwood; and a new volume of poems by Mr. Gilder. 

"Borderland," is the title selected by Mr. W. T. 
Stead for his newest periodical venture. It is to be " a 
quarterly review and index devoted to the study of the 
phenomena vulgarly called ' supernatural.' " Mr. Stead, 
it may be mentioned, has lately become a medium him- 
self, and we may expect some astonishing tales from 
his forthcoming quarterly. 

In the French Academy of Inscriptions M. Haureau 
recently announced the discovery of a new manuscript 
of Abelard's poem addressed to his son. It contains 
1,040 verses, of which only 461 were hitherto known. 
It contains some of the heretical views attributed to 
him, it mentions He*loise, and versifies a passage from 
one of her letters. M. Haureau will publish the poem. 

Sir Frederick Pollock has the following " note " in 
" The Author " for July : " I earnestly hope that no at-

tempt will be made at the Chicago meeting to revive 
the project of perpetual copyright. In my opinion it 
would be pure waste of time. The abstract jurispru- 
dence of this question was thoroughly discussed in the 
great case of Jefferys vs. Boosey in the House of Lords, 
in 1854, and there can be nothing new to say about it." 

" Pierre Loti " has decided to devote himself to a new 
work, the plot of which will be laid in the Holy Land. 
To obtain materials for his " coloring " he will make a 
pilgrimage through Palestine, starting from Cairo as 
soon as the summer heat is over, and proceed across the 
desert to Jerusalem. There will be no Europeans in 
his caravan. His idea is to follow as near as he can 
the route taken by the Holy Family in the flight into 
Egypt. 

We learn from the London " Academy " that Mr. 
Paget Toynbee, who has been engaged for some years 
upon a Dictionary of the " Divina Comedia," has 
decided to divide the publication into two parts. The 
first, which will be complete for the whole of Dante's 
works, Latin as well as Italian, will contain the arti- 
cles dealing with the proper names. The second 
will comprise the Vocabulary proper. Mr. Toynbee 
hopes eventually to supplement the latter with the 
vocabulary of the " Convito," " Vita Nuova," and " Can- 
zoniere." 

Mr. R. H. Sherard writes from Paris to " The Au- 
thor " of the breakfast given to M. Zola in celebration 
of the completed Rougon-Macquart series. He says: 
" There were about two hundred guests, and the dejeuner 
was held on one of the islands in the Bois de Boulogne. 
Zola looked very spruce in a black frock coat, light 
grey trousers, and a pair of varnished boots. He called 
his publisher ' my old friend,' and said, ' If I have not 
ceased writing you have not ceased publishing," so that, 
in sort, as much of the honor was due to the pub- 
lisher. It was a pleasant sight to see author and pub- 
lisher sitting side by side united by such bonds of affec- 
tion." 

The Independent Theatre of London offers the fol- 
lowing highly attractive programme for next season: 
" William Rufus," by Michael Field, to be given without 
scenic accessories; " The Black Cat," a play in three acts, 
by Dr. Todhunter; "A Family Reunion," a play also in 
three acts, by Mr. Frank Danby; "Salve," a one-act 
play, by Mrs. Oscar Beringer; "The Death of Count 
Godfrey," by Messrs. Walter Besant and W. H. Pol- 
lock; Mr. Archer's translation of Herr Ibsen's " Wild 
Duck"; and "The Heirs of Rabourdin," translated by 
Mr. A. Teixeira de Mattos from M. Zola. " La Prin- 
cesse Maleine " of M. Maeterlinck is to be given by ma- 
rionettes. Herr Strindberg's " Father" is being trans- 
lated by Mr. J. H. McCarthy; and Mr. G. Bernard 
Shaw will supply a new play. 

A passage put into the mouth of Horne-Tooke by 
Landor (in the first Conversation between Johnson and 
Horne-Tooke) bears aptly upon the present discussion 
of the decadence of modern English. Indeed, the whole 
dialogue is wise and racy in comments on the tenden- 
cies of English. " I wish I were as sure," says Horne- 
Tooke, " that 

Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere,

I am unacquainted with any language in which, during 
the prosperity of a people, the changes have run so sel- 



dom into improvement, so perpetually into impropriety. 
Within another generation, ours must have become so 
corrupt that writers, if they hope for life, will find it 
necessary to mount up nearer to its Sources." 

Mr. C. A. Ward, writing to "The Athenseum," tells 
of the recovery of a Coleridge manuscript by many 
thought to have no other than a mythical existence. 
Mr. Ward's letter is as follows: " The name of Samuel 
Taylor Coleridge stands out so prominently in the col- 
umns of 'The Athenaeum 'of June 17th that if atten- 
tion be not solely to be restricted to the poetical suc- 
cesses of this myriad-minded man the greatest man 
of our century, towering over all else by a head and 
shoulders, as critic, thinker, bard what follows may 
have interest. There have drifted to me by accident 
(though at each step traceable historically) two vol- 
umes, quarto, of MSS., bound, entitled respectively: 
' The History of Logic ' and ' Elements of Logic.' In 
Coleridge's letter to Allsop the work is mentioned as 
complete and nearly ready for press. This assertion 
has been called an opium-dream. But here is the book. 
It is not very like modern philosophy; but some care 
to hear two sides of a question. I write to ascertain 
whether the agnostic materialism is now so established 
that high spiritualism can no longer be allowed to 
breathe, and for such purpose nothing can test the 
point like ' The Athenseum.' "

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 1893. 



D. APPLETON & Co:s NEW BOOKS. 



The Life of Sir Richard F. Burton. 

By his Wife, ISABEL BURTON. With numerous Portraits, 
Illustrations and Maps, and two colored Plates. In 2 vols., 
8vo, cloth, $12.00. 

The career of the late Sir Richard F. Burton, the distinguished 
traveler, and editor of "The Arabian Nights," was perhaps the most 
adventurous and romantic of any Englishman of the last generation. 
He was an encyclopedic scholar, and much more than a scholar. He 
knew and had seen more of dark Africa than most men, and more of 
Mohammedan lands than any man. It seemed a simple thing for him 
to travel in disguise among fanatics where discovery meant death, but 
his life was manysided, and his biography illustrates a remarkable va- 
riety of interests. Lady Burton has proved her literary ability before, 
and in these volumes she has done justice to an exceptional opportunity. 

Camp=Fires of a Naturalist. 

By CLARENCE E. EDWORDS. The Story of Fourteen Expe- 
ditions after North American Mammals. From the Field 
Notes of LEWIS LINDSAY DYCHE, A. M., M. S., Professor 
of Zoology and Curator of Birds and Mammals in the Kansas 
State University. With numerous Illustrations. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

This book sketches big game hunting in the West from a new point 
of view. The author describes the actual adventures and experiences 
of a naturalist who has hunted from Mexico to the northern confines 
of British Columbia, pursuing grizzly bears, mountain sheep, elk, moose, 
and other rare game. As an outdoor book of camping and hunting this 
possesses a timely interest, but it also has the merit of scientific exact- 
ness in the description of the habits, peculiarities, and haunts of wild 
animals. 

The Health Resorts of Europe. 

A Medical Guide to the Mineral Springs, Climatic, Mountain, 
and Seaside Health Resorts, Milk, Whey, Grape, Earth, 
Mud, Sand, and Air Cures of Europe. By THOMAS LINN, 
M. D. With an Introduction by T. M. COAN, M. D. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

A History of Crustacea. 

By Rev. THOMAS R. R. STEBBING, M. A., author of " The 
Naturalist of Cumbrae," "The Challenger Amphipoda," 
etc. With numerous Illustrations. Vol. 71, International 
Scientific Series. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

" It is not very generally known that the species of Crustacea extend 
to a number of several thousands. . . . The beginner will have provinces 
of a new world opened to his exploration. There is curiosity to be 
gratified. The sporting instinct will discover many an unexhausted 
territory. In the manners and customs of the creatures there is much 
to afford entertainment, and almost every new observer finds something 
singular to relate." From the Preface. 

The Story of My Life. 

By GEORO EBERS, author of " Uarda," " An Egyptian Prin- 
cess," "A Thorny Path," etc. With portraits. 16mo, cloth, 
$1.25. 

General Green. 

By Col. FRANCIS V. GREEN, author of " The Russian Army 
and Its Campaigns in Turkey," etc. The fourth volume 
in the Great Commanders Series, edited by Gen. JAMES 
GRANT WILSON. With portrait and maps. 12mo, cloth, 
gilt top, $1.50. 

General Nathanael Green has been termed " the most remarkable 
man, all things considered, among the soldiers of the Revolution," and 
it has been said that there was "no one whose reputation and advance- 
ment can with more justice be attributed exclusively to personal merit." 
His biography, which has been written in a clear, incisive, always inter- 
esting style by Francis Vinton Green, whose literary reputation was 
established by his book, "The Russian Army and its Campaigns in 
Turkey m 1877-'8," presents a vivid picture of campaigns which extended 
from Newport to Georgia, and involved the larger part of the military 
history of the Revolution. 



Many Inventions. 

By RUDYARD KIPLING. Containing fourteen stories, sev- 
eral of which are now published for the first time, and two 
poems. 12mo, 427 pages, cloth, $1.50. 

" ' Many Inventions ' will confirm Mr. Kipling's reputation. . . . 
We could cite with pleasure sentences from almost every page, and 
extract incidents from almost every story. But to what end ? Here is 
the completest book that Mr. Kipling has yet given us in workmanship, 
the weightiest and most humane in breadth of view." Pall Mall Ga- 
zette. 

" Mr. Kipling's powers as a story-teller are evidently not diminishing. 
We advise everybody to buy ' Many Inventions ' and to profit by some 
of the best entertainment that modern fiction has to offer." New 
York 8vn. 

" ' Many Inventions ' will be welcomed wherever the English language 
is spoken. . . . Every one of the stories bears the imprint of a master 
who conjures up incident as if by magic, and who portrays character, 
scenery, and feeling with an ease which is only exceeded by the bold- 
ness of force." Boston Globe. 

The Simple Adventures of a Memsahib. 

A new book by SARA JEANNETTE DUNCAN, author of " A 
Social Departure" and "An American Girl in London." 
With many illustrations by F. H. TOWNSEND. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

" It is like traveling without leaving one's armchair to read it. Miss 
Duncan has the descriptive and narrative gift in large measure, and she 
brings vividly before us the street scenes, the interiors, the bewilder- 
ingly queer natives, the gayeties of the English colony." Philadelphia 
Telegraph. 

"It will keep you amused to the three hundred and eleventh page." 
Davenport Democrat. 

" A clever story, full of humor and shrewd observation of character, 
and worthy of the author of 'A Social Departure."' Christian at 
Work. 

A Border Leander. 

By HOWARD SEELY. 12mo, flexible cloth, with special design 

in green and silver, 75 cents. 

The popularity of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.'s dainty Summer Fic- 
tion Series insures a welcome for the attractive and enlarged form of 
the series this year. "A Border Leander," the first volume in this 
series, is a picturesque Western romance abounding in incident and 
humor. In their new form these volumes will be found desirable for 
preservation in the library as well as for summer reading.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITER- 
ATURE. 



For some time past " The Athenaeum " has 
published annual summaries of the current lit- 
erature of Continental Europe, each country of 
importance being represented by a special ar- 
ticle. To the year just ended are devoted no 
less than thirty-two pages of the issue for July 
1 of our English contemporary, and the infor- 
mation given by this series of communications 
is of such interest that we feel justified in de- 
voting considerable space to a summary of their 
contents. There are in all thirteen articles, 



the countries represented being Belgium, Bo- 
hemia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, 
Holland, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, 
and Sweden. This list includes, it will be seen, 
every European country of any literary import- 
ance, with the two exceptions of Norway and 
Portugal. 

M. Joseph Reinach, who is the French con- 
tributor to this symposium, thus comments upon 
the general literary situation in France : 

" The word crisis is, indeed, the most applicable to 
the present state of French letters. They are on a field 
of battle where two different mental tendencies are 
struggling for mastery: science and metaphysics, criti- 
cism and belief, realism and idealism. Fifty or sixty 
years ago the same phenomenon appeared, and then 
romanticism triumphed over classicism, positivism over 
spiritualism, liberal ideas over the old principles of abso- 
lutism. Which will triumph to-day cannot be predicted 
with certainty. Perhaps neither of the tendencies which 
I have indicated will be victorious; perhaps the two 
currents of existing thought will continue to run par- 
allel. At most one may discover under the vacillations 
of the moment an uneasiness in matters of social action, 
and in regard to letters in particular a growing belief 
that they are not merely a relaxation, an amusement, 
or a consolation, but that they ought to result in some 
direct teaching and help to man, tracing for him a line 
of conduct in life. This will be better understood after 
a rapid glance at the principal works of French litera- 
ture during the last twelve months." 

After a few comments upon the influence ex- 
erted over French thought by the two great 
men of letters who have recently died Renan 
and Taine M. Reinach begins his review 
with some remarks about M. Ernest Lavisse, 
whose " Jeunesse de Frederic II." is one of the 
notable books of the year. 

" His talents as a sagacious historian and a fascinat- 
ing writer have often been remarked upon, but he is, 
perhaps, less known as an educationalist to those who 
are not familiar with the progress and history of school- 
mastering. M. Ernest Lavisse has in this department 
left a very deep impress on the generation of young 
professors and their youthful auditors of the Faculty of 
Letters at Paris, where he teaches. After 1870 he 
held that it was the mission of the Ministers of Public 
Education, and especially of the professors of history, 
to know and make known the secret of our conquer- 
or's power. That is why all his endeavors have been 
concentrated on the annals of Prussia and Germany. 
His success has been so signal, both in the quality of 
the matter and the excellence of the manner of his work, 
that the author of ' Etudes sur les Origines de la Prusse ' 
is recognized to-day as an incontestable authority on 
the point." 
Studies of the French Revolution have figured

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



largely in the work of the past year, having been 
encouraged by the Society of the History of the 
Revolution, and by a special chair established 
by the Faculty of Letters at Paris. Some of the 
books in this department are M. Aulard's " Le 
Culte de la Raison et le Culte de 1'Etre Su- 
preme, 1793-1794," the fourth volume of M. 
Albert Sorel's "L'Europe et la Revolution," 
and M. H. Houssaye's " 1815." Other histor- 
ical studies are M. Thureau-Dangin's work on 
the reign of Louis Philippe, M. Spuller's work 
on Lamennais, M. Leroy-Beaulieu's " La Pa- 
paute, L'Eglise, et la Democratic," and M. 
Benoist's " L'Eglise et 1'Etat." In poetry, M. 
Jose Maria de Heredia's " Les Trophees " is 
singled out for special praise. In fiction, the 
place of first importance is given to M. Zola's 
" La Debacle," of which we read : 

" When this work appeared its morality was the sub- 
ject of much discussion. Some of its critics took ex- 
ception to the mournful picture of the military disor- 
ganization, the despair and general hopelessness which 
marked the terrible downfall of the empire. Some, in- 
deed, went so far as to accuse M. Zola of a serious lack 
of patriotism for having thus laid bare the story of our 
army's sufferings and defeats. These criticisms do not 
seem to me to have much foundation. The catastrophe 
at Sedan, terrible as it was, had certain lessons to teach, 
and it is well that someone should have interpreted 
them. There is a patriotism, as sincere and as ardent 
as the other, which finds in a defeat something to be 
learned and pondered over for future guidance." 

Other noteworthy works of fiction are M. Bour- 
get's " Terre Promise " and " Cosmopolis," M. 
Margueritte's " Sur le Retour," M. Prevost's 
"L'Automne d'une Femme," M. France's "R6- 
tisserie de la Reine Pedauque," M. Barres's 
" L'Ennemi des Lois," and M. Lemaitre's "Les 
Rois." In criticism are mentioned a volume 
of essays by M. Brunetiere, M. de Vogue's 
*' Heures d'Histoire," and M. Doumic's " De 
Scribe a Ibsen." M. Reinach concludes his 
article in the following hopeful strain : 

" The ethic or, to use a less pretentious word, the 
moral character of literature is regaining importance. 
The most of our men of letters are writers with a thesis 
even those who seem to sacrifice the least to the de- 
sire of proving a truth; and the most wayward allow 
themselves to be impressed by the serious problems of 
the moment. In poetry, too, symbolism efforts to ex- 
press what young theorists call ' the mystery of things ' 
is a sign of the general state of men's minds. It is 
the same with the historian in the choice of subject, and 
with the character and part some assign to critics. 
<L'art pour Part,' 'le de'sinte'ressement litte'raire,' are 
phrases that have had their day, as well as descriptions 
of gross realities. The object of our best writers ap- 
pears to be to teach men what one of them calls ' le de- 
voir present et 1'action morale.'" 

Herr Robert Zimmermann, who writes the 



German article, says that the literature of his 
country at the present day has less to fear from 
a comparison with contemporary literatures 
than from a comparison with its former great- 
ness, with the " time of its literary classicism 
and philosophical idealism," which is so ob- 
vious as hardly to be worth the saying. In 
dramatic literature, nothing published has been 
found worthy of the Grillparzer prize, which 
is awarded only to dramas of inherent worth 
and proved success upon the stage. We have 
mention, however, of Herr Fulda's " Das Ver- 
lorene Paradies " and " Die Sklavin," of Herr 
Sudermann's " Hirmat," of Herr Hauptmann's 
" Die Weber," of Herr Wilbrandt's " Der 
Meister von Palmyra," and of Herr Widmann's 
" Jenseits von Gut und Bose." The latter title 
is also given to the latest philosophical work of 
Herr Nietzsche. This is a very fin de siecle 
book, as appears from the writer's comment : 
" The justifiable contention that the man who has ar- 
rived at complete moral control over himself no longer 
requires the leading-strings of duty and legal restraint 
goes too far when it is assumed that commands and 
precepts are only binding upon lower ' mankind, and 
that the ' higher,' or so-called < upper,' mankind is above 
the law and the opposite qualities of good and bad. The 
moral cynicism contained therein is veiled by the sem- 
blance of greatness that superiority to the law conjures 
up in the minds of na'ive readers and onlookers." 

Among novels, Herr Heyse's " Merlin " leads 
the list, followed by the " Per Aspera " of Dr. 
Ebers, the " Sonntagskind " of Herr Spiel- 
hagen, and the " Glaubenslos " of Frau von 
Ebner-Eschenbach. The Goethe Gesellschaft 
has been active during the year, and has done 
something towards the rehabilitation of Chris- 
tiane. There has been no end of Bismarck 
literature, mostly ephemeral. Herr Nietzsche, 
besides the book already mentioned, has pub- 
lished the fourth volume of his principal work, 
" Also Sprach Zarathustra." Having fallen a 
victim to the curse of insanity, the career of 
this brilliant writer is probably closed. 

Literature has been active in all three of the 
Scandinavian countries, and we much regret 
that Norway should be unrepresented in the 
" Athenaeum " symposium. Herr Alfred Ipsen, 
writing from Denmark, tells us : 

" The public is tired of books crammed with discus- 
sion, so that they seem the works of so many journal- 
ists tired of a sterile realism, which has ended with 
giving us only photographs of life, disregarding the 
human soul's everlasting thirst for something beyond or 
behind reality. There is a feeling that we have had 
enough of sexual abnormities and pathological phenom- 
ena enough of stories of sinful and merely sensual 
love, detailed with minute accuracy. . . . Some point

on his works, while they proceed to imitate him as fast 
as they can. Many still swear by Henrik Ibsen, and 
especially by his last esoteric dramas. French sym- 
bolists also are finding imitators and eulogists among 
our youngest writers, and Baudelaire has been canon- 
ized by a few young poets who ' have read him.' " 

The writer makes particular mention of the in- 
terest aroused in Denmark by the Shelley cen- 
tenary, and of Dr. A. Hansen's translation of 
" Prometheus Unbound." A sumptuous mon- 
ograph on Thorvaldsen is among the note- 
worthy books of the year, but the name of the 
author is not given. A great cooperative work 
on the Denmark of to-day is also mentioned. 
A dictionary of Danish national biography is 
being edited by Herr Hegel of the Gylden- 
dalske firm of publishers. Other books of im- 
portance are Professor P. Hansen's " History 
of the Royal Danish Theatre," Dr. Vedel's 
work upon Dante, and his " Kulturbaerere " 
("Bearers of Culture"), the latter being studies 
of Boccaccio, Petrarch, Chaucer, and others. 

Herr Hugo Tigerschibld, who writes from 
Sweden, thus characterizes the most important 
book of the year : 

" The most remarkable literary production of the 
year is certainly Louis de Geer's ' Minnen ' (' Memoirs '). 
Animated by an infinite love of truth, the aged states- 
man has bequeathed to his country the picture of a no- 
ble and upright, clear, if not altogether deep, personal- 
ity, in whose life, both private and political, one can 
never detect any but the purest motives. At the same 
time he has imparted to us in these memoirs many im- 
portant and hitherto unknown documents relating to 
Sweden's most recent history, which no one knows bet- 
ter than he who has taken such an active part in it." 

The death of the Countess Leffler-Cajanello was 
the most serious loss of Swedish letters during 
the year ; a posthumous sketch of her friend, 
Professor Sonja Kovalevski, is among the books 
of the year mentioned by the writer of this 
article. Another posthumous work of import- 
ance gives to the public the letters and me- 
moirs of the great chemist Scheele, and proves, 
we are told, " to demonstration the claims of 
Scheele to be regarded as the discoverer of 
oxygen." The following extract from the Swed- 
ish article is of much interest : 

" The difficulties which Swedish authors in the field 
of 'belles-lettres have to contend with, and which, so far 
as they result from the limited area of the language and 
the restriction of the book market to a very short period 
of the year, have already been touched upon in my pre- 
vious review, have led during the present year to a 
combination of authors into an Authors' Union. The 
narrow circle which an author in Sweden can reckon 
upon, in consequence of the limited area of the lan- 
guage in general, is made even narrower than it need 
be by several other circumstances. A torrent of trans- 
lations from foreign belles-lettres of very doubtful value, 



not uufrequently acquired by publishers at unreasona- 
bly low prices, really floods the market, and competes 
with the works of original native authors. The Union 
has, therefore, set before it the task of ostracizing both 
bad translations and translations of bad books, and 
thereby establishing fixed minimum prices for both 
translations and original works." 

The article on Italy is the work of Signori 
Ruggero Bonghi and Giovanni Zannoni, and 
the following extracts are taken from the open- 
ing paragraphs : 

" It is scarcely fifteen years since the domination of 
current Italian literature by one or the other of two 
schools of poetic thought if, indeed, they deserve the 
name seemed inevitable, and that two possible ways 
only were open to it, one of which it must follow. The 
tendency of the one school was to revert to classical 
models, more particularly Horace, both in subject-mat- 
ter and in form ; the other followed in the steps of the 
latest examples of the French naturalistic school, bor- 
rowing all its worst features and all its exaggerations." 

Of the men of the first school we read : 

" But their existence was short. The very audacity 
of their aims, and the sickly wantonness of many of 
them, not only wearied the reading public, but soon 
roused its indignation. To-day the majority of these 
poets have no alternative but to be ashamed of their 
own verses." 

The work of the other school is thus summar- 
ized : 

" The classical school, on the other hand, had a no- 
bler object and a wider scope. Giosue Carducci set 
forth its guiding principles in a volume which contains 
some of his best lyrics. He showed by his work how 
the art of Horace could best be reproduced in Italian 
lyric poetry, how best to render to Italian ears the 
music of hexameters and pentameters, alcaics and as- 
clepiads. To-day this neo-classic school seems also to 
be on the brink of dissolution, although it can still boast 
one or two good writers." 

Signer Carducci, of course, remains the one 
great poet of contemporary Italy. 

" On the 20th of September, the anniversary of the 
breach of the Porta Pia, it has now been for some years 
Carducci's custom to publish an ode on some national 
topic, inspired by the glory of our political resurrection. 
The title of this year's poem is ' II Cadore.' Cadore pos- 
sesses some of the most stirring memories in the north 
of Italy. Here it was that a long and fierce struggle 
took place against the Austrian troops. Cadore sent 
forth the best of her sons, her women, and her priests 
to fight for liberty so long as they had a drop of blood 
to shed. It was a truly heroic defense, worthy of being 
sung in epic and lyric strains, and Carducci has cele- 
brated it in lofty patriotic verse." 

After mentioning the " Odi Navali " of Signor 
d'Annunzio and the " Carmi e Odi Barbare " 
of Signor Razetti, the article continues as fol- 
lows : 

" The following tendencies are, therefore, to be noted 
in regard to the development of poetry in Italy at pres- 
ent, viz., the repudiation of the neo-classic style, even 



58

by those who have themselves closely followed it in the 
past, and the rise of a lyric poetry whose aim is to be 
the exponent of the miseries of the wretched. Hence 
academic poetry with its fixed poetic systems is falling 
into disuse, and it is not possible to save it. Upon its 
ruins is rising a new type of lyric poetry, devoting 
itself to otiose meanderings. The first fact need occa- 
sion nothing but rejoicing; the second should warn us 
to advance somewhat circumspectly. Since a young 
poetess, Ada Negri, with the true poetic instinct, strong 
and original, has carried a generous wrath into glowing 
verses, too many have thought themselves to be inspired 
by the social muse ; but its notes are harsh and sombre. 
No longer do we see the old-fashioned Arcadia with its 
piping shepherds, but another type of Arcadia per- 
haps a less pleasing one with its oppressed and its 
barricades." 

Among novels we are especially asked to note 
Signer Praga's " La Biondina," Signer de Ros- 
si's " Mai d'Amore," Signer Farina's " Amore 
Bugiarda," Signer Mambrini's " A Bordo," 
and Signora Serao's " Castigo." In miscella- 
neous literature, Signora Beri's " In Calabria," 
Senatore Pasolini's " Caterina Sforza," Signer 
Centelli's " Caterina Cornaro e il Sue Regno," 
and Signer Carducci's " La Storia del Giorno 
di Giuseppe Parini," seem to be particularly 
noteworthy. 

Senor Riano leads off his discussion of con- 
temporary Spanish letters with some remarks 
upon the books called forth by the Columbus 
centenary. Among these we note " Autografos 
de Cristobal Colon y Papeles de America," a 
volume of original documents published by the 
Duchess of Berwick and Alba, and Senor 
Asensio's " Fuentes Historicas Sobre Colon y 
America." The writer thus concludes the Co- 
lumbus section of his article : 

"To end with this topic, which is becoming rather 
tedious, I may conclude by saying that two important 
points have been gained: one is that it is almost certain 
that Columbus's birthplace was Savona; the other that 
Amerigo Vespucci never thought of giving, or pretended 
to give, his own name to the new continent discovered 
by Columbus, but that it was entirely the fault of those 
who drew the first charts of the discovered continent." 

We are also told of the Congress of Ameri- 
canists assembled last October at Huelva, and 
of the linguistic studies stimulated by that 
gathering. There has been of late a consider- 
able revival in Spain of interest in Arabic 
studies, as the following paragraph will show : 

" For some time past my countrymen seem to have 
arrived at the conviction that the study of the Oriental 
languages, and principally of the Magrebi or Western 
Arabic, is not only indispensable for the complete knowl- 
edge of the national annals, but also useful in view of 
Spain's mercantile and political relations with Morocco. 
Hence it is that the number of chairs or professorships 
at the universities has been increased; that manuscripts 
have been bought at Tunis, Algiers, and elsewhere ; and 



that numerous publications are daily being made on 
the history and geography of Mohammedan Spain. I 
scarcely need call your readers' attention to the collec- 
tion of Hispano-Arab historians which the learned Pro- 
fessor of Arabic at the University of Madrid is now 
continuing, and the eighth volume of which, containing 
the text of Ebu Alfaradhf, a writer of the fourteenth cen- 
tury of our era, has just appeared. Under the title of 
' Estudios sobre la Invasion de los Arabes en Espana,' 
Saavedra (Don Eduardo) has published what may be 
rightly denominated a luminous essay on the invasion of 
Spain by the Moors." 

In belles-lettres, nothing of special importance 
has appeared during the year, unless we ac- 
cord that distinction to " Mariana " and " Do- 
lores," two comedies by Senor Echegaray. 

M. Paul Fredericq's Belgian article opens 
as follows : 

"The two principal events in the annals of French 
literature in Belgium during the last twelve months are 
the republication of the ' Le'gende d'Uylenspiegel ' of 
the late Charles de Coster, and the production at Paris 
of the ' Pelldas et Mdlisaude ' of M. Maurice Maeter- 
linck." 

Other works deemed worthy of special mention 
are M. Nautet's " Histoire des Lettres Beiges 
d'Expression Francaise," M. Eekhoud's " Au 
Siecle de Shakespeare," M. Kurth's " L'His- 
toire Poetique des Merovingiens," the conclu- 
sion of " L'CEuvre de P. P. Rubens," by M. 
Rooses, and the conclusion of the " Cours 
d'Histoire Nationale," by Mgr. Nameche. Of 
the latter work we read : 

" The twenty-ninth and last volume of Mgr. Nameche's 
great ' Cours d'Histoire Nationale ' has just made its ap- 
pearance, although the author died, at the age of eighty- 
two, in January last. This volume stops at the year 
1804, and deals with the history of Belgium under the 
Consulate. The first volume of this vast and scholarly 
composition was published forty years ago." 

Among books written in the Flemish language, 
the writer gives the place of first importance 
to M. van Zuylen's " De Belgische Taalwetten 
Toegelicht," a work " designed to furnish an 
account of the laws on the official use of the 
two national languages." The death of La- 
veleye has been the great loss of the year in 
Belgian letters. 

From Holland, Mr. Taco H. de Beer writes 
to inform us that " there is a dreadful monot- 
ony about the middle-class Dutchman and about 
the ordinary society of the Dutch East Indies, 
which form the staple materials of our novel- 
ists." The successes in Dutch fiction have been 
" Eene Illusie," by Mr. Couperus, " Johannes 
Viator," by Mr. van Eeden, and " De Bre- 
deros," a historical novel by Professor Jan ten 
Brink. Among plays, " Petrus Dathenus," 
by Mr. Hoogewerf, and " Het Goudvischje," 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



59 



by Mr. van Nouhuys, are noted. The follow- 
ing note is of curious philological interest : 

" What might interest English readers is the appear- 
ance of a little book of Professor Bulbring, the well- 
known philologist from Heidelberg, who lately was made 
Professor of English at Groningen. The oratio inau- 
guralis of the Professor of English at a Dutch univer- 
sity was delivered in German ! The professor's pre- 
decessor was never heard speaking English in public, 
nor will the present professor address his audience in 
that language. As Professor Bulbring discoursed about 
' Wege und Ziele der Englischen Philologie,' it is rather 
curious that he did not prove by example that speaking 
the language is one of the aims of English philology." 

Contemporary Russian literature is treated 
at some length by Mr. P. Milyoukov, who does 
not, however, find many important works to 
mention. What he says of the literary tenden- 
cies of the last decades is highly interesting. 

" The ' men of the eighties,' who made a virtue of 
their want of principle, have been silent. It is not so 
long ago that they were making a stir and causing people 
to talk of them, although by no means formidable; but 
latterly, although certain publicists belonging to the 
party still continue to pour out the vials of their wrath, 
nobody pays them any attention. Again, during the 
1 seventies ' a curious movement sprang up which was 
called ' going among the people,' and consisted in an 
adoption of the life of farm labourers by educated and 
cultivated young men, who thus established colonies 
amongst the peasantry which served as centres for the 
spread of socialism. During the ' eighties ' these set- 
tlements succumbed to the prevalent tone, and, cutting 
themselves off from their surroundings, devoted them- 
selves, partly under the influence of Tolstoy's teach- 
ings, to the work of self-perfection. To-day they have 
taken a new departure. They have recognized that this 
self-centred work of internal improvement leads in- 
evitably to mysticism and sectarianism, and deprives 
them of all wider influence. In a word, the rise in the 
social temperature, which I recorded last year, continues 
unmistakably. The Russian social movement is clearly 
preparing itself for fresh and increasing efforts. To 
begin with, after putting aside the programme of the 
1 men of the eighties,' we have commenced an active 
survey of the social programmes of preceding periods. 
This is, indeed, the meaning of a renewal of the contro- 
versy between our liberals and our radicals, or party of 
the people; for in a country where eighty-eight per 
cent of the population are peasants, radicalism is bound 
to be popular." 

A few of the publications mentioned by Mr. 
Milyoukov are the " Village Communes " of 
Vorontzov, an " Essay in Russian Historiog- 
raphy," by Professor Ikonnikov, and a volume 
of " Sketches and Tales," by Korolenko. 

Mr. Adam Belcikowski, who writes of things 
Polish, calls our attention to " Lux in Tenebris 
Lucet," and " Do We Follow Him," both by 
Mr. Sienkiewicz, and both showing signs of an 
encroaching mysticism which we hope will not 
make of this great writer a second Tolstoi. 
" Charcyzy," a historical novel by Mr. Rawita, 



and " The Annals of the Western Slavs," by 
Mr. Bogulawski, are other noticeable books of 
the year. Mr. V. Tille, the Bohemian corres- 
pondent, reports much Comenius literature, 
two volumes of poems and one of essays by 
Mr. Vrchlicky, the first part of Mr. Vlcek's 
" History of Bohemian Literature," and a gen- 
eral tendency towards realism. Herr Leopold 
Katcher, writing from Hungary, praises " The 
Gyurkovics Girls," by Mr. Ferencz Herczeg, 
the True Stories " of Dr. Adolf Agai, Mr. 
Gracza's " Life and Work of Kossuth," and 
the " Social Economy " of Professor Foldes. 
Mr. Jokai, also, has published a novel, "Brother 
George," in five volumes. This popular writer 
is soon to celebrate " the half-centenary of his 
literary activity " or rather it will be cele- 
brated for him by the publication of his col- 
lected works in a limited edition de luxe. Last 
of all upon our list comes an article from Greece, 
by Mr. S. P. Lambros, who tells us of Mr. 
Karkavitsas, and his tales, called "Diegemata"; 
of " The Eyes of My Soul," by Mr. Palamas, 
and " The Singer of the Village and the Fold," 
by Mr. Krystallis, both volumes being verse. 
With these notes we must bring to an end our 
digest of this very valuable series of articles, 
referring our readers to the pages of " The 
Athenaeum " both for other titles and for further 
details concerning the books that we have sin- 
gled out for mention. 



THE A UXILIAR Y CONGRESSES. 

The space at our disposal in the last issue of THE 
DIAL was so fully taken up with the account of the 
Congress of Authors that we were obliged to post- 
pone our report of the four other Congresses held 
during the week ending July 15. The subjects of 
those Congresses were, as our readers have already 
been informed, Philology, Folk-lore, History, and 
Libraries. 

THE CONGRESS OF PHILOLOGISTS. 

The Congress of Philologists embraced the regu- 
lar annual meeting of the American Philological 
Association, specially appointed meetings of the 
Modern Language Association of America and the 
American Dialect Society, a meeting of the Spelling 
Reform Association, and a number of general meet- 
ings for the consideration of papers not presented 
by the organized bodies of philologists above men- 
tioned. The Congress assembled, as a whole, what 
was probably the most important gathering of phil- 
ologists that ever met in the United States ; and 
there is likely to follow, as one of its consequences, 
a series of biennial joint meetings of the philological 
societies of the country. The American Philolog- 
ical Association usually devotes the first evening

session of its annual meeting to an address, upon 
some subject of extra-philological interest, by the 
President for the year. Professor William Gard- 
ner Hale, of the University of Chicago, has occu- 
pied that position for the year just ended, and his 
address was given Tuesday evening, July 11, the 
subject being " Democracy and Education." It was 
a scholarly exposition of the particular perils to 
which the higher education is exposed in a demo- 
cratic environment, and, in the case of our own 
country, opened a fairly hopeful outlook upon the 
future. Among the papers read before the Asso- 
ciation at its subsequent sessions we may mention 
the following as of special value : " The Language 
of the Law," by Mr. H. L. Baker ; Vedic Studies," 
by Professor Maurice Bloomfield ; and " The Re- 
mote Deliberative in Greek," by Professor W. G. 
Hale. On Wednesday and Friday mornings, there 
were held two " general sessions," devoted mainly 
to the papers offered by distinguished European 
guests of the Association. These papers included 
" The Connection between Indian and Greek Phi- 
losophy," by Professor Richard Garbe, of Konigs- 
berg ; " Helles and Dunkles I im Lateinischen," 
by Professor Hermann Osthoff, of Heidelberg; 
" Indogermanische Ablautprobleme," by Professor 
Wilhelm Streitberg, of Freiburg ( Switzerland ) ; 
and " The Scientific Emendation of Classical Texts," 
by Professor E. A. Sonnenschein, of Birmingham. 
Other papers read at these sessions were : " Some 
Problems in Greek Syntax," by Professor Basil L. 
Gildersleeve ; " The Relation of Philology to His- 
tory," by Professor M. Bloomfield ; and " The Eth- 
ical and Psychological Implications of the Style of 
Thucydides," by Professor Paul Shorey. A paper 
on "Unpublished Manuscript Treasures," by Mr. 
T. G. Pinches, of the British Museum, was pre- 
sented at one of the sessions. Mr. Pinches had 
made his preparations to be present at the Congress, 
but was, at the last moment, detained in London 
by a vexatious lawsuit. A paper sent by Professor 
Michel Bre'al, of the College de France, had for its 
subject "Canons of Etymological Investigation," 
and was made the basis of an interesting discus- 
sion, opened by Professor B. I. Wheeler. Another 
discussion, led by Professor M. Bloomfield, had for 
its theme the "Importance of Uniformity in the 
Transliteration of non-Roman Alphabets." The 
Association, before adjourning, transacted its regu- 
lar business, and elected Professor James M. Gar- 
nett, of the University of Virginia, as President for 
the coming year. 

The meeting of the Modern Language Associa- 
tion comprised two sessions, both on Thursday, July 
13. Among the papers presented were : " The 
Language of the Sciences and a Universal Lan- 
guage," by Professor F. A. March ; " German Phi- 
lology in America," by Professor M. D. Learned ; 
and " The Training of College and University Pro- 
fessors," by Professor A. Rambeau. The Ameri- 
can Dialect Society and the Spelling Reform Asso- 
ciation had one session each. 



The sessions not held under the special auspices 
of the philological organizations were seven in num- 
ber, and offered a preponderance of papers upon 
subjects in the department of oriental archaeology. 
These papers were collected by Mrs. Elizabeth A. 
Reed, and to this lady is due a special word of 
praise for her efforts in behalf of the Congress. 
Dr. Max Ohnefalsch-Richter, of Berlin, lectured 
upon Cypriote archaeology ; and Professor W. H. 
Goodyear, of Brooklyn, summarized the line of 
argument, based upon a study of prehistoric orna- 
ment, that has made him a firm believer in the 
non-Asiatic origin of the Aryans. Both these lec- 
tures were illustrated with the lantern. Other speak- 
ers and papers comprised in the programmes of 
these miscellaneous sessions were : " Old Testament 
History in the Light of Recent Discoveries," by 
Dr. William C. Winslow, who represents the Egypt 
Exploration Fund in this country ; and " Cleopatra," 
a lecture by Dr. Samuel A. Binion, of New York. 

The following papers (the writers not being pre- 
sent) were among those sent to be read at the Con- 
gress : " Greek Ceramography in Relation to Greek 
Mythology," by Miss Jane Harrison of London ; 
" Schliemann's Excavations," by Mrs. Schliemann, 
of Athens ; " Assyrian and Babylonian Libraries," 
by Professor A. H. Sayce, of Oxford ; " Babylonian 
and Assyrian Archaeology," by Mr. Hormuzd Ras- 
sam, of London ; and " Koptic Art and Its Relation 
to Early Christian Ornament," by Dr. Georg Ebers, 
of Munich. 

THE CONGRESS OF HISTORIANS. 

The Congress of Historians was called to order 
by Dr. W. F. Poole, on Tuesday morning, July 11, 
and was organized by the choice of Dr. James B. 
Angell, of Michigan University, as President, and 
Dr. Herbert B. Adams, of Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, as Secretary. These gentlemen hold the same 
positions in the American Historical Association, 
and nearly all the contributors of papers are mem- 
bers of the same Association. The sessions were 
continued morning and evening for three days, the 
afternoons being devoted to the Fair at Jackson 
Park. Notwithstanding the fact that five Con- 
gresses were in progress at the same time and un- 
der the same roof, the history sessions were at- 
tended by several hundred interested auditors, and 
the Congress was regarded by all as a complete suc- 
cess. Universities and colleges were largely repre- 
sented in the scheme of exercises. Of the contri- 
butors of the thirty-three papers, three were presi- 
dents of universities and seventeen were professors, 
most of them professors of history. Of the other 
contributors, ten were well-known historical writers, 
and four were ladies, whose papers were among the 
most interesting read. It will be seen that ama- 
teur historians and sensational theorists had no 
place in the programme. President Angell was the 
reader of the first paper, his subject being " The 
Inadequate Recognition of Diplomatists by His- 
torians." It was listened to with great interest,

and set forth the eminent services of diplomatists, 
whose names, in connection with these services, are 
rarely mentioned by English and American histor- 
ians. French and Continental writers have a better 
appreciation of historical justice. The discussion 
of " The Value of National Historical Archives," 
by Mrs. Ellen Hardin Walworth, of Saratoga, was 
one of the ablest and most practical papers read at 
the Congress. It depicted in eloquent and forcible 
terms the need of such a department at Washing- 
ton. All the other great, and many of the smaller, 
nations of the world have departments of archives, 
and the United States has none. The student of 
American history must go, or send, to Europe, or 
to Canada (which has an excellent department of 
state papers), to find documents which should be 
in Washington. Mrs. Walworth concluded by offer- 
ing a resolution to the effect that a committee be 
appointed to memorialize our national Congress to 
establish such a department. An earnest discussion 
followed, supporting the resolution, and it passed 
unanimously. 

Dr. James Schouler, of Boston, and Dr. Charles 
J. Little, of the Northwestern University, happily 
discussed " The Methods of Historical Investiga- 
tion " and " The Historical Method of Writing the 
History of Christian Doctrine." Dr. Fred. Ban- 
croft read a paper on "Mr. Seward's Position to- 
ward the South from November, 1860, to March 4, 
1861." On Wednesday morning, " Pre-Columbian 
Discovery," "Prince Henry, the Navigator," and 
" The Economic Conditions of Spain in the Sixteenth 
Century " were ably treated by the Hon. J. P. Bax- 
ter, of Portland, Me., Prof. E. G. Bourne, of Adel- 
bert College, and Prof. Bernard Moses, of the Uni- 
versity of California ; and Prof. Lucy M. Salmon, of 
Vassar College, read a good paper on " The Union of 
Utrecht." In the evening the Hon. William Henry 
Smith, of Lake Forest, and Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites, 
of Madison, Wis., read interesting papers on " Early 
Slavery in the Northwest " and " Early Lead Min- 
ing in Illinois and Wisconsin." Thursday morning 
opened with a scholarly paper by Dr. L. H. Boutell, 
of Chicago, on " Roger Sherman in the National 
Constitutional Convention," in which he replied to 
the claim made by Dr. Charles J. Stille", in his 
life of John Dickinson, that Dickinson was the 
author of the provisions of the Constitution con- 
cerning the number and choice of Senators. Other 
excellent papers were read, which we have not 
space to mention. The time, during the six sessions 
of more than two hours each, was fully occupied, 
and it was necessary to omit the reading of papers 
when their writers were not present. 

THE FOLK-LORE CONGRESS. 

It is quite impossible to summarize, in any de- 
tailed way, within the limits of the space available, 
the results of a Congress that cost months of active 
preparation and extended through six busy days. 
Only the barest outlines can be presented. The 
Congress was planned and held in the face of op- 



position and discouragement from organized bodies 
in London and Boston the American Folk-Lore 
Society's Secretary declaring that it would be im- 
practicable to hold a World's Congress in the United 
States at this time. In view of the phenomenal suc- 
cess of the Congress, these elements of difficulty 
and discouragement should be noted ; as should the 
fact that the success is very largely due to the un- 
tiring labors and enthusiasm of Lieut. F. S. Bassett, 
chairman of the committee of arrangements. This 
was the third International Congress of Folk-lore 
ever held, and really the first to which all nations 
were invited, and in which representatives from 
nearly all civilized peoples of the earth participated. 
More than thirty nationalities were represented, one 
hundred persons actively participating in the literary 
exercises, and more than a hundred in the concert. 
Twelve sessions were held, at which sixty-eight pa- 
pers and addresses were read and forty-seven sep- 
arate songs were sung, in addition to the phono- 
graphic chants. The geographical range of the 
essays was unrestricted. The folk-lore of all lands 
was treated at the hands of those who were natives, 
or who had lived in the lands of which they spoke, 
from Corea to Dalmatia. Many distinguished folk- 
lore scholars from abroad assisted personally in 
this exposition of the folk-lore of Asia, Africa, Eu- 
rope, and the two Americas. Among these were 
the Hon. John Abercromby, Vice President of the 
English Folk-lore Society ; Mr. Michel Smigrodzki, 
of Poland, a member of the Paris Socie'te' des Tra- 
ditions Populaires ; Mr. Vucasovic, of Dalmatia ; 
Mr. Mihic, of Servia; Mr. Beers, Secretary of the 
New Orleans Society ; the Hon. Lorin Thurston, of 
Honolulu; Dr. V. I. Shopoff, of Bulgaria; Mr. 
Paul Groussac, of Buenos Ayres ; and Mr. Ludwig 
Krwyzinski, of Poland. 

The scientific range of the papers read was also 
remarkable. No branch of folk-lore was unrepre- 
sented. Myths, legends, customs, superstitions, re- 
ligions, songs, in fact, all branches of folk-speech, 
folk-wont, and folk-thought, were dealt with. Par- 
ticularly were the legends and customs of the Amer- 
ican aborigines treated at the hands of such experts 
as Surgeon Matthews, Lieutenant Scott, Dr. East- 
man, Mr. James Deans, Mr. Quelch, Lieutenant 
Welles, and Mr. Groussac. Dr. Matthews's wonder- 
ful collection of phonographed Navajo songs, and 
Lieutenant Scott's exposition of the sign language, 
were especially meritorious. Nor was the black man 
neglected. He carried off the honors at the con- 
cert, and in the hands of Miss Owen, Mrs. Watson, 
and Mrs. Sheldon, his superstitions and customs 
and his strange literature were ably represented. 
Many of these essays were made more popular by 
the objects from strange lands used in illustrating 
them, as, for example, Dr. Matthews's " Navajo 
Rites," Mr. Stephen's Hopi pigments, Mrs. French- 
Sheldon's African charms, Mr. Smigrodzki's tablet 
of the Svastika, and Mr. Quelch's South American 
musical instruments.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



The bibliography of folk-lore has never received 
the attention here given to it. Signor Pitre* for 
Italy, M. Sdbillot for France and Creole literature, 
Seiior Rodriguez for Venezuela, and the Rev. J. C. 
O'Hanlon for Ireland, fully presented the folk-lore 
bibliography of those lands. What may be called 
literary folk-lore received excellent treatment in 
Dr. Prato's exhaustive article on "The Symbolism 
of the Vase," Mr. Field's charming poem, Mrs. 
Catherwood's Loup-garou story, Professor Drago- 
monov and Mr. Head's " Taming of the Shrew," 
Dr. Carsten's analysis of Longfellow's " Golden 
Legend," and the Hon. John Abercromby's magic 
Finnish poetry. 

But it was in folk-song particularly that this Con- 
gress excelled. Besides the full collection of Na- 
vajo songs made by Dr. Matthews, and the really 
beautiful folk-songs of Mr. Smigrodzki, Mr. Mihic, 
and Mr. Cable, a concert consisting of more than 
forty solos and choruses, and embracing folk-music 
from Japan, India, Ceylon, Turkey, Africa, Swe- 
den, Norway, Russia, Poland, Bohemia, England, 
Italy, Scotland, Spain, France, Wales, and North 
and South America, was rendered by natives of 
those lands in the costumes and languages of the 
countries, and accompanied frequently by their own 
strange instruments. This concert, made possible 
only by the presence of specially-organized World's 
Fair choruses, and by the courtesy of various for- 
eign commissioners, was given free to the public in 
the two great halls of the Art Institute, to more 
than six thousand people, the numbers given in one 
hall being repeated to the audience in the other 
immediately after their performance in the first. Mr. 
Frederick W. Root, who arranged the concert, de- 
serves the greatest credit for successfully accom- 
plishing this task, without a rehearsal, and with no 
precedent to guide him. 

In the Folk-lore Congress, as in others, women 
played a very important part. Very much of the 
success of this Congress was due to the admirable 
tact, perseverance and effort of the acting chair- 
man of the Woman's Committee, Mrs. S. F. Bassett. 
Eight essays were contributed by women, and much 
of the success of the concert was due to them. 

THE CONGRESS OF LIBRARIANS. 

The annual meeting of the American Library As- 
sociation, which is always an occasion of very great 
interest to all persons engaged in library work, was 
merged, this year, into the Congress of Librarians, 
the papers read and subjects discussed taking, in 
consequence, a somewhat wider range than is usual 
at the meetings of the Association. The Congress 
was opened on Wednesday morning, July 12, by 
the chairman of the local committee, Mr. F. H. 
Hild. Mr. Melvil E. Dewey, President of the Amer- 
ican Library Association, who was selected to pre- 
side at the first day's Congress, delivered the open- 
ing address, in which he comprehensively reviewed 
library progress in the United States during the 
present century. He was followed by Mr. Fred- 



erick M. Crunden, Librarian of the St. Louis Pub- 
lic Library, who read an interesting paper on " The 
Librarian as Administrator." The second session 
of the Congress, on Thursday morning, was pre- 
sided over by Mr. Samuel S. Green, Librarian of 
the Worcester Public Library, who read an able 
paper on "State Library Commissions." Mr. R. 
R. Bowker, of "The Library Journal," followed 
with a paper on " National Bibliography," and the 
session closed with a paper by Prof. R. C. Davis, 
Librarian of the University of Michigan, on " An 
Over-use of Books." On Friday morning Mr. Fred- 
erick M. Crunden called the third session of the Con- 
gress to order. The first paper was by Mr. Charles 
A. Cutter, formerly Librarian of the Boston Athe- 
naeum, who spoke on " The Note of the American 
Library." Mr. E. H. Woodruff, Librarian of the 
Leland Stanford University, read an admirable pa- 
per on " Present Tendencies in University Libra- 
ries." He was followed by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, 
President of the Chicago Public Library Board, 
whose remarks on " The Public Library in its Re- 
lation to Education " were listened to with the 
greatest attention. Among other papers read at 
this session were one on " The International Mutual 
Relations of Libraries," by Dr. Carl Dziatzko of the 
University Library of Gottingen, and one on " The 
Direct Interchange of Manuscripts between Libra- 
ries," by Dr. O. Hartwig, of the Royal University 
Library of Halle. Both of these papers were read by 
Mr. E. F. L. Gauss, who had made excellent trans- 
lations of the German originals. Two excellent pa- 
pers were presented by women librarians ; viz., 
Miss C. M. Hewins, Librarian of the Hartford Li- 
brary Association, on " The Pictorial Resources of 
a Small Library," and Miss Jessie Allan, of the 
Omaha Public Library, on " The Library as a 
Teacher of Literature." The closing session of the 
Congress, on Saturday morning, was presided over 
by Miss M. S. R. James, Librarian of the People's 
Palace, London, who read a most interesting paper 
on " The People's Palace and Its Library." Mr. 
Peter Cowell, Librarian of the Liverpool Public 
Libraries, addressed the Congress on the subject of 
"How to Popularize the Public Library." Mr. 
E. C. Richardson, Librarian of Princeton College, 
read a paper on " Library Science and Other 
Sciences," and was followed by Miss Tessa Kelso, 
of the Los Angeles Public Library, who gave an 
animated address on " Some Economic Features 
of a Library." Mr. William I. Fletcher, Librarian 
of Amherst College, spoke on " The Library Cata- 
logue of the Twentieth Century," and Miss Kather- 
ine L. Sharp, Librarian of the Armour Institute, 
read in conclusion an interesting paper on " The 
Library Exhibit at the World's Fair." For want 
of time, some six additional papers on the pro- 
gramme were read by title only before the Congress 
adjourned. Following the four sessions of the Con- 
gress, the American Libraiy Association held six 
meetings, at the various libraries in Chicago, dur- 
ing the week beginning July 17.

THE DIAL 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"PERHAPS AN ERROR." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL for July 1, I examined very briefly 
certain uses of known to and unknown to. The exam- 
ination was ancillary to the more important inquiry, 
Has " F. H." ever erred ? Following the same line of 
research, I now submit, with illustrative quotations, a 
word or two about but; premising, as in my former let- 
ter, that " F. H." has identified himself in the public 
press as the author of " Modern English." 

Dr. Hall, or " F. H.," commenting adversely on Lan- 
dor's praise of Gray's English, says: 

" But is Gray's English, from the ordinary point of view, 
altogether faultless ? Look at ... his preterites begun, run, 
and throwed ; and his past participles broke, chose, and wrote. 
Add his . . . ' none but they '; ' nobody but /'; ' I have seen 
nothing, neither '; ' nor drink out of nothing but '; ' every- 
body . . . them.' In his Progress of Poesy, furthermore, he 
violates all idiom by," etc. ("Modern English," pp. 103-4, 
footnote.) 

A careful reading of Dr. Hall's note can leave no 
doubt, I think, in the mind of anybody that the words 
and phrases quoted in it were regarded by Dr. Hall as 
bad English. And no doubt most of them must be so 
regarded now. But are they all bad ? 

Pausing first to remark that Gray wrote the English 
of his time, the grammar of which was very unsettled, 
I venture to say that " none but they " and " nobody but 
/ " are very good English, as good English as there 
is. Of course I don't mean that the prepositional use 
of but with the objective case is bad English. 

"... although no man was in our parts spoken of but he 
for his manhood . . ." (Sir Philip Sidney, " Arcadia," Col- 
lected Writings, edition of 1598, p. 38.) 

" There is none but he, 
Whose being I doe feare." 

("Macbeth," III., i., First Folio, reduced fac-simile.) 
" Not out of confidence that none but wee 
Are able to present this Tragedie." 

(Chapman," Bussy D'Ambois," Prologue.) 
"... yet who would keep him company but I ? " (Id.) 
" An humerous dayes mirth." (Tragedies and Comedies, 
London, 1873.) 

" Then came brave Glorie puffing by 

In silks that whistled, who but he ? " (George 
Herbert, "The Temple" [The Quip], first ed., fac-simile 
reprint, p. 103.) 

"... and none but they can carry Arms . . ." (James 
Howell, " Familiar Letters," Sect. I., xxxx., ed. of 1645, p. 80.) 
" The most obvious answer, then, to the question, why we 
yield to the authority of the Church in the questions and de- 
velopments of faith, is, that some authority there must be if 
there is a revelation, and other authority there is none but 
she." (Cardinal Newman, "An Essay on the Development 
of Christian Doctrine," London, 1846, pp. 126-7.) 

" Under such circumstances, any men but they would have 
had a strong leaning towards what is called ' Conservatism.' " 
(Id., " Historical Sketches," London, 1885, Vol. iii., p. 131.) 
" And in his hand he shakes the brand 

Which none but he can wield." 
(Macaulay, " Lays of Ancient Rome," Horatius, xlii.) 

"... since none puts by 
The curtain 1 have drawn for you, but I." 

(Browning, "My Last Duchess.") 

Our old young friend Casabianca turns up here. A 
remark in Wells's Grammar, citing 

" The boy stood on the burning deck, 
Whence all but hint had fled," 



is quoted by Goold Brown in The Grammar of English 
Grammars " (p. 596, 10th edition, New York, 1880) . In 
the carefully printed Philadelphia edition (seven vol- 
umes, 1840) of the works of Mrs. Hemans, the lines read: 
" The boy stood on the burning deck 
Whence all but he had fled." 

Sometimes, of course, the objective case is required 
whether the construction be regarded as conjunctional 
or prepositional. 

"... one that hath no other guide but him. . . ." (Sir 
Philip Sidney, "The Defence of Poesie," Collected Writings, 
edition of 1598, p. 498.) 

The quotations from Cardinal Newman that are 
given above are especially interesting here, because Dr. 
Hall has expressed very emphatically his opinion as to 
the correctness of Newman's writing. In his " Modern 
English" (p. 292, footnote), he says: 

" Dr. Newman, when writing at his best, comes nothing 
short of Addison, for grace, and, for correctness, is incompar- 
ably his superior. . . . Having studied nearly every line of 
Dr. Newman's voluminous writings, I am surprised to find how 
little there is in them, as regards words and uses of words, to 
arrest unfavourable attention." 

And at page 329, he writes: 

"... some of the choicest of living English writers em- 
ploy it [a certain locution] freely. Preeminent among these 
stands Dr. Newman. . . ." 

Some instances where Cardinal Newman's English 
has arrested the " unfavourable attention " of Dr. Hall 
are mentioned in his note at page 292, but the use of 
the nominative case after but is not among them.

ENGLISH DRAMA AT THE UNIVERSITIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

To a student of the Elizabethan drama one of the 
significant facts of the times is the great interest in 
the drama manifested by the universities and public 
schools throughout the period. Not only were plays 
from the classics revived, but original compositions in 
Latin in great numbers were written and performed be- 
fore the students, while many of the best productions of 
the English dramatists of the period were acted with 
great applause at Oxford and Cambridge. The uni- 
versities, too, turned out, with or without honors, many 
of the most accomplished Elizabethan playwrights and 
poets, and in one way or another took no inconsiderable 
part in the development of that great drama which is 
now the pride of English-speaking people. 

In these days of Independent Theatres and of uni- 
versity revivals of classic Greek and Latin plays, is it 
not a little singular that the universities do not go a 
step farther and attempt the revival of some of the 
neglected classic plays of English literature, as well as 
of Greek and Latin literature ? Nothing could more 
strikingly serve both to emphasize and to promote the 
reviving interest in the study of English literature than 
attempts of this sort. It may be trusted that the an- 
cient Puritanism of our colleges is sufficiently mellowed 
by time ere this to permit such a vanity, and surely 
among the many new methods of teaching literature 
none could be more engaging to the healthy taste of 
youth than this, and none could serve to connect the 
study more closely with life. C.

MORE "RECOLLECTIONS OF A HAPPY 
LIFE." * 



Those who have read Marianne North's 
" Recollections of a Happy Life " will approve 
the publishing by the editor, Mrs. J. A. Sy- 
monds, of a supplementary volume of " Further 
Recollections " containing certain earlier chap- 
ters of Miss North's journals omitted from the 
original work. We may say at once that while 
the new volume lacks the scientific interest of 
its predecessor, it easily surpasses it in wit and 
vivacity. The chapters now given were orig- 
inally omitted, chiefly, as the editor tells us, 
because the journeys described were over what 
is nowadays comparatively well-trodden ground 
an objection, however, which loses force in 
the case of narrators whose " travel-pictures," 
like Miss North's, are largely a reflection of tem- 
perament. Miss North had, in a special sense, 
her own way of seeing things. What she des- 
cribes comes to us tinged and refracted, as it 
were, through a quite peculiar medium ; so 
that it really matters little in point of novelty 
whether her observations are made from the 
deck of a Nile dahabieh or from the top of a 
Brompton omnibus, the results being in either 
case largely out of the average ken. 

The most objective and guide-lookish of Miss 
North's descriptions have, however, a certain 
value of their own, in that they enable us to con- 
trast the travel of thirty years ago with the 
more convenient, if less picturesque, methods 
of our own day. Railways and Cook's steamers 
had not then, in Spain and on the Nile, quite 
supplanted the leisurely arrangements of more 
primitive travel. The jogging, jingling cara- 
van of mules is now, almost everywhere, a thing 
of the past ; so is the old Spanish diligence 
a delightful vehicle in which Miss North was 
whirled " at a furious pace over zig-zag passes 
and round shoulders of the Pyrenees, racing 
with a rival diligence in a most breakneck 
manner, too shaken and exhausted even to no- 
tice the wondrous change of vegetation." There 
is a big hotel now at Luxor ! fitted with the 
"modern improvements," and affected by squads 
of Cook-forwarded pilgrims ; and, in short, the 
ubiquitous railway, wafting abroad the winged 
seeds of the " Anglo-Saxon contagion," will in

a few more years have made travel, as the edi- 
tor laments, " everywhere exactly alike." 

" Further Recollections " is essentially a trans- 
cript of the journals kept by the author from 
1859 to 1870, while travelling with her father 
in Spain, Switzerland, Egypt, and the Levant. 
The thread of continuity supplied in the open- 
ing volume by the scientific purpose of the 
writer's later journeyings, is here lacking. It 
is distinctly the work of a younger woman 
of a fresh young girl with a fair stock of read- 
ing and a vast stock of animal spirits, whose 
keen enjoyment of the novelties of foreign 
travel is bracingly manifest in every page of 
her diary. Miss North was a specially stout- 
hearted and independent traveller, one of the 
sort whose elasticity of spirits is more than 
proof against the annoyances and discomforts 
that form the melancholy refrain of the narra- 
tives of less resolute pilgrims. The direst mis- 
hap serves, with her, to point a jest. At the 
very start, for instance, a precious portmanteau 
(one portmanteau, containing everything that 
this admirable woman thought necessary for a 
journey of several months) fell overboard in 
the harbor at St. Heliers : 

" Everything was thoroughly soaked, and had to be 
spread out separately to dry; all my paints, paper, and 
dress (only one) ; for we took the least possible luggage, 
and yet had everything we really needed, even luxu- 
ries^) including a bonnet, whose crown I used to stuff 
with a compact roll of stockings and cram into a hole 
left for it amongst my underclothing, just big enough to 
contain it: when taken out it would be damped and set in 
the sun, with the stockings still in the crown, and it 
stretched itself into proper shape again, and was the 
admiration of all beholders." 

Very different, we may note in passing, 
from Miss North's slender effects must have 
been the baggage train of the American ladies 
(the " Skinners of Boston ") whom she saw 
later at Phila? tripping about among the rel- 
ics of the Pharaohs, appropriately dressed 
" in Worth's very latest fashions," and con- 
voyed by a male apparition clad " in a com- 
plete suit of cineraria color, from stockings to 
cap." Sarcastic Miss North ! She even goes 
on to say that, owing to this " Yankee incur- 
sion " (that is her disrespectful expression) 
from the Back Bay, " the place lost half its 
charm," etc. 

A pleasanter American experience was her 
meeting with Miss Hosmer in Rome in 1860. 

" Once Miss Raincock took me to see Gibson's young 
American pupil, Miss Hosmer, in a large unfurnished 
studio she had just taken, where she was preparing to 
make a portrait statue of some famous countryman, it 
was to be nine feet high, she said (looking herself like

a small child) ; she had only one chair, which she gave 
me, as the stranger ; seating our old friend on the table, 
she mounted to the top of a high ladder herself, from 
whence she chattered and laughed with the happy air of 
one who is sure to please. Miss Raincock had once re- 
ceived a note from Gibson, That poor American girl 
has fever, come and nurse her,' so she had packed up 
her old carpet-bag and gone at once to obey the order, 
thus forming a friendship for life." 

But Miss North's turn for satirical portrait- 
ure was by no means reserved for Americans. 
Among the most amusing of her " Innocents 
Abroad " was a Frenchman, a fellow-passenger 
on the Nile boat, who was, she rather naively 
complains, " absurdly national and unlike us 
in everything " Curiously enough, Monsieur, 
on his side, seems to have been observing his 
English companions, and making, mutatis mu- 
tandis, the same conclusions about them. Says 
Miss North : 

" He got up late in the morning, and came into the 
saloon in demi-toilette as we were finishing our break- 
fast, having been ' strangled ' and frozen entirely by the 
cold, and, mon Dieu ! he had no appetite ! he would 
take a glass of lemonade and his narghile, and lecture 
us in the most polite and unreasonable way about the 
betise and English barbarism of fatiguing the stomach 
so early in the morning by eating; after a little while 
he would get faint with hunger, and declare the cold 
would kill him, and, mon Dieu 1 he would die if he got 
nothing to eat till so late, and Achmet ya Achmet! and 
then he began gorging like a boa-constrictor, stopping 
every now and then to explain how much better the 
food would have been if, etc., after which he began 
smoking again, and tried to draw, but, mon Dieu ! he 
had no time; if he only had time he could do something 
of true merit. . . . Mr. S. confided to me that the 
Frenchman went to bed clothes and all, and that his 
toilette in the morning consisted of a thorough brushing 
downwards with the same brush, beginning with his hair, 
then his green velvet coat, and lastly his dear shining 
boots, c'est tout, voila ! He also complained that he 
could not get filtered water to wash in; if he could not 
get it filtered he would not wash his ' figure ' at all. He 
was told Madame only used that of the Nile for hers. 
' Madame was too good to complain, and besides she 
was an Englishwoman, bah'!" 

Miss North visited Egypt in 1865, and she 
gives a lively account of the country and peo- 
ple and of her own experiences. The route 
from Alexandria ("a nasty, mongrel, mosquito- 
ish place ") to Cairo reminded her of the fens 
of Ely; but the country was richly cropped 
with cotton and Indian corn, with scarcely a 
tree to break the monotony of the view, and but 
few villages. The cottages were merely square 
blocks of hardened mud, windowless and with 
the flat roofs covered with pigeons, chickens, 
and cats ; primitive ploughs, like the ancient 
models in old Egyptian carvings, were scratch- 
ing the rich soil. 

"The natives had that calm, soft type of countenance 



that marks the old statuary of their country, large eyes 
and gentle expression, but no strength of character, and 
one could easily see that the old sculptors had before 
their eyes the ancestors of the present race, and that, 
though the ruling classes might be changed in Egypt, 
the fellahs or original population of the land are of the 
same blood as their forefathers." 

Books might be filled, says Miss North, with 
the architectural wonders of Cairo, its elaborate 
arabesques, and lacelike patterns in stone-work, 
plaster, and wood-carving. The tombs outside 
the city were the greatest gems of all, though 
they were only visited by flights of falcons or 
stray Arab wanderers. Europeans seemed pop- 
ular with the people, who were fond of showing 
off any words they knew. Miss North's donkey- 
man, like most of his tribe, was a special lin- 
guist. He knew " a few words of many lan- 
guages, and made the most of them by trans- 
posing and reversing their order in a sentence ; 
for instance, ' gentleman like donkey,' ' no gen- 
tleman like donkey,' 'donkey no like gentleman.' 
He told his beast where to go, and the clever 
creature trotted off right or left accordingly. 
'Donkey speak English,' then the donkey always 
put its ears back and kicked out behind," a 
proceeding reminding one of the intelligent 
animal that carried Silas Wegg to " Boflinses 
Bower " on a memorable occasion. 

The author confesses to having regarded 
things Egyptian " from a purely picturesque 
point," and was scolded for this by the Cairo 
clergyman's wife: 

" ' Dear, dear, like all travellers, you wander hither 
and thither and see nothing with a proper object, every- 
thing from a false point of view. I suppose you never 
considered that on the precise spot where those Mame- 
luke tombs stand the Israelites made their bricks with- 
out straw ! ' And her husband took us to the top of a hill 
and showed us the very stone on which Moses stood to 
count the Israelites as they passed out of Egypt." 

The start from Cairo was made the day after 
Christmas, and the author's record of the en- 
suing Nile voyage is studded with characteristic 
bits of vivid, semi-humourous description. At 
Luxor, Miss North visited the eccentric Lady 
Duff Gordon, whom she had seen twenty-five 
years before. Lady Lucie was picturesquely 
installed in some rooms raised up amongst the 
pillars of an old temple, " like a second story " : 

" She herself was old and gray, but had still the 
handsome face which had captivated me then, in spite 
of having burst two blood-vessels that year, and she said 
the air at Luxor did wonders for her. The natives all 
worshipped her, and she doctored them, amused them, 
and even smoked with them. They looked on her as 
something mysterious, and even rather uncanny, and 
respected her accordingly." 

Later, at Karnak, Miss North was rather 



66

[Aug. 1, 



startlingly reminded of one of Lady Gordon's 
early eccentricities : 

" Once while painting, and quite absorbed in my work 
at Karnak, a man sat down close to me, and I said ' Good 
morning,' without looking up, till Hassan pulled my 
dress, and, oh horror ! the man was holding a huge 
golden snake by the tail, a yard of shining, polished, 
slippery snake, quite straight and looking at me ! I 
shouted and sprang away, and Hassan drove off the 
two wretched brutes. They take out the fangs of these 
tame snakes, but I hate even the sight of them now, 
though I used to like poor Lucie's pet when I was a 
child." 

The justness of the following description of 
our heroine's first crocodiles will be recognized 
by those familiar with both terms of her com- 
parison : 

" One day we saw seven crocodiles, looking like rocks 
or shadows on the sand ; we were disputing if they were 
really crocodiles, when the huge creatures curved their 
backs with a violent effort, raised themselves on what 
our Frenchman called their 'pattes,' and slid slowly 
into the water, as a fat lady descends from her car- 
riage, with a certain waddle and air of importance." 

Everything in Thebes appeared to Miss North 
" too stupendous," seeming, as she says, 
" To blunt my poor wits and pencil too, no cutting could 
get the wretched thing to draw straight; and then the 
flocks of Americans and ' backsheesh ' people drove all 
peace away. The little women of eleven or twelve 
years old, who carried water jars on their heads, only 
supported by the palm of one hand, keeping up with 
our fast donkeys at a run, were very bewitching, with 
their bright eyes and easy graceful movements. They 
said they were all ladies, not girls, meaning they were 
married. ' You got wife ? ' they asked me. ' Oh yes, 
you have in house in England ! ' as if I locked up 
my husband at home as they do their wives here." 

Near the caves of Beni Hassan the writer en- 
countered her first Egyptian "saint," who 
seems to have been, in some points, very like 
his historic prototypes : 

" One morning we were surprised to see Achmet and 
the Reis go on shore amicably together, after incessant 
squabbling, for a walk, but a few minutes later a wild 
head with a mop of hair came suddenly out of the water 
and up the boat's side, and its owner seated himself on 
the edge and tied himself into a petticoat which he had 
brought on the top of the mop, and then proceeded to 
kiss all the sailors, who did not enjoy it, while we 
shrank closer into our cabin shell. The poor fellows 
all gave him some coppers, and after he had adminis- 
tered another hugging all round, he took off and folded 
up his petticoat, put it on his head, and dived and swam 
off to a boat full of corn near us, to levy the same tax. 
They said he was mad, and consequently a saint, and 
thus gained his own livelihood." 

We shall close our extracts from Miss North's 
journals with the following description of the 
journalist herself, given by the Egyptian pilot 
who took the Norths up the river : 

" This Bint was unlike most other English Bints, be- 
ing, firstly, .white and lively; secondly, she was gracious 



in her manner, and of kind disposition; thirdly, she at- 
tended continually to her father, whose days went in re- 
joicing that he had such a Bint; fourthly, she repre- 
sented all things on paper, she drew all the temples of 
Nubia, all the Sakkiahs, and all the men and women 
and nearly all the palm trees; she was a valuable and 
remarkable Bint." 

The portrait is certainly more complimentary 
to its subject than to English " Bints " (we 
confess to some uncertainty as to the meaning 
of this term) in general. 

There are three illustrations, including por- 
traits of the author and her father, and a pen- 
sketch, by a fellow-traveler, which is so absurdly 
bad that it is difficult to account for its inclu- 



sion.

AN EVOLUTIONIST'S ALARM.* 



Professor Calderwood's work on " Evolution 
and Man's Place in Nature " belongs to a class 
of books that may not inaptly be designated 
as " buffers." Their service is to soften the 
shock between new scientific doctrine and the 
dogmas of popular religion. This work has 
been done for the science of geology, and is 
now rapidly doing for the new biology that 
dates from Darwin. Those who have never 
experienced the need of a reconciliation be- 
tween religion and science, and those who pre- 
fer to devise their own systems of " accommo- 
dation," will take but a moderate interest in 
" buffers." Acute metaphysical minds will find, 
in some form of Berkeleian idealism, a way out 
from the disconsolate vision of a merely me- 
chanical world, in which Darwinism, on a first 
hasty interpretation, seemed to issue. Crude 
literal materialism has been proved unthinka- 
ble, they will argue. Matter that contains in 
itself the power and potency of all forms of 
life and thought must be conceived as the man- 
ifestation of a power most nearly akin to what 
we know as mind. Belief in such a world- 
soul would seem mere pantheism. But it did 
not seem so to Berkeley ; and Berkeley was 
right. With the Infinite and Unknowable, all 
things are possible. We cannot tell how far 
the roots of personality penetrate into the real 
nature of things ; and since we have no right 
to dogmatize on either side, we may properly 
throw the weight of our moral and religious 
feelings into the scale of hope. Evolution ex- 
plains the process, it does not explain away 
the fact, of creation. And, like other winds of 
scientific doctrine that terrified our fathers, Dar-

win ism, when the storm of controversy has died 
down, will be found to have left unshaken the 
pillars of man's faith in his higher spiritual 
destiny. 

But there are many estimable persons who 
refuse to be soothed by these subtle considera- 
tions. Their alarmed imaginations require 
visible tangible barriers of defense something 
like Professor Max Miiller's Rubicon of lan- 
guage "which no brute will dare to cross." 
And it is for these that Professor Calderwood's 
book is chiefly designed. He finds that the 
continuity of evolution is interrupted at three 
points : (1) at the creation of organic life, (2) 
at the appearance of mind, (3) at the advent 
of " rational life." At each of these points he 
erects a barrier and assumes a direct interven- 
tion of the living source of all existence. In 
defense of the first barrier, he offers no argu- 
ment beyond the generally acknowledged fact 
that spontaneous generation cannot now be ex- 
perimentally verified. In separating by a sharp 
line of demarcation " rational life " from animal 
life, he follows Mr. Wallace, whose arguments 
he amplifies into an elaborate rhetorical expo- 
sition of the many distinctive qualities that 
differentiate the developed nineteenth century 
man from the animals. The one novel feature 
of his teaching is the affirmation (p. 340) that 
" the inferior type of mind recognized as be- 
longing to the higher animals cannot be ac- 
counted for by evolution from sensory appa- 
ratus any more than rational power can be thus 
explained." Sensibility is coexistent with life. 
But no one, Professor Calderwood argues, would 
make mind coexistent with life, for that would 
be to assign mind to the oyster, and pass as by 
a dissolving view into the Hegelian monism. 
The difference between sense-discrimination 
and mind, or intelligence proper, is that the 
latter not only distinguishes sensations, but 
recognizes their significance, interprets them 
as signs of something else. The power of the 
higher animals to do this, the ability of a 
dog, for example, to understand our signs, 
cannot be accounted for by the structure of 
the brain. To explain it we must assume a 
higher form of intelligence independent of the 
organism, and yet radically distinct from the 
active power of inventing signs for his own ra- 
tional or moral ends, which is the peculiar pre- 
rogative of man. It would seem that the poor 
Indian's untutored mind was not so far astray, 
after all, in thinking that, 

" Admitted to that equal sky, 
His faithful dog shall bear him company." 



It is hardly worth while to attempt to clear up 
the psychological misconceptions involved in 
this ratiocination. The rigid distinction be- 
tween mere sense-discrimination in the oyster 
and the interpretation of sensation in the higher 
animals is of course untenable, for the simple 
reason that there is no case of sense-discrimi- 
nation unaccompanied by a corresponding in- 
terpretation. Even the amoeba interprets soft 
as organic and digestible, and hard as inor- 
ganic and indigestible, and shapes its action 
accordingly. And from the amoeba to the dog 
the correspondence between immediate sensa- 
tion and consequent action based on " inter- 
pretation " develops too gradually to admit of 
the drawing of any absolute dividing line. We 
may say, if we please, that the reaction in the 
amoeba is purely physiological or mechanical, 
while in the dog it is accompanied by conscious- 
ness. But the only basis for such an asser- 
tion would be the fact that the dog has a brain 
and the amoeba has none. And Professor Cal- 
derwood's contention is that the higher facul- 
ties of the dog are in no way expressed in his 
physical structure. In fact, the attempt to 
" draw the line " anywhere except between man 
and the animals is not a serious issue in con- 
temporary speculation, and the loose reasoning 
of this book will not make it one.

THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC.* 



" There is nothing in history more strange and yet 
more true than the story that has been told so often, 
but which never palls in its interest, that of the life 
of the maiden through whose instrumentality France re- 
gained her place among the nations." 

Thus does the latest historian of Joan of Arc 
introduce his story of her life. And he adds : 
" Sainte Beuve has written that, in his opinion, the 
way to honor the history of Joan of Arc is to tell the 
truth about her as simply as possible. This has been 
my object in the following pages." 

It is no reproach to Lord Ronald that he has 
told the story of the heroine whom his mother 
loved ( u my mother," he says, " had what the 
French call a culte " for Joan of Arc) rather 
as the affectionate admirer than the cold-blooded 
critic. There are times, indeed, when the ju- 
dicial spirit looks ungraceful, especially in a 
young man. The book is written in a style of 
graphic simplicity, with as little affectation in

the point of view or arrangement as in the dic- 
tion. Through his very straightforwardness 
and idiomatic energy, the author often grows 
truly impressive and pathetic ; while we never 
lose our faith in his truthfulness or his common 
sense. He has graphically rendered Jeanne's 
lovable qualities those qualities that saints 
and martyrs, alas I do not inevitably possess. 
She is more than Michelet's woman of genius 
in these pages more even than De Quincey's 
heroic saint. To Lord Ronald, whose research 
has breathed the breath of life into this dim 
and lovely shade, she is just the gentle, infin- 
itely compassionate, but not unwise woman, 
who is the guardian angel in her family, or 
her village, or her nation, as opportunity may 
offer. Her people were well-to-do farmers, her 
father holding a certain position in the com- 
munity as the oldest inhabitant (doyen) of the 
village, and ranking next to the mayor. The 
family owned " about twenty acres of land, 
twelve of which were arable, four were meadow- 
lands, and four were used for fuel." Besides 
this, they had some two to three hundred francs 
kept safe for use in case of emergency, and the 
furniture, goods, and chattels of their modest 
home. " All told, the fortune of the family of 
Joan attained an annual income of about two 
hundred pounds of our money." A thousand 
dollars a year needs doubling, if not trebling, 
to reduce it to our standard ; and Lord Ronald 
very sensibly remarks that it was " a not in- 
considerable revenue at that time ; and with it 
they were enabled to raise a family in comfort, 
and to give alms and hospitality to the poor." 

Of this family, Jeanne was the fifth child, 
and, it would appear, was rather indulged by 
her parents. She was not, for all the wonder- 
ful visions that saved France, a mystic or a sol- 
itary ; she joined in all the sports of her play- 
mates, and was a leader and a favorite. 

" She loved her mother tenderly, and in her trial she 
bore witness before men to the good influence that she 
had derived from that parent. . . . All that we gather 
of Joan's early years proves her nature to have been a 
compound of love and goodness. . . . From her earliest 
years she loved to help the weak and poor; she was 
known, when there was no room for the weary wayfarer 
to pass the night in her parents' house, to give up her 
bed to him, and to sleep on the floor by the hearth." 

She was a pious little girl, and loved to lis- 
ten at her mother's knee to the recital of the 
marvels of the saints ; she was also patriotic, 
and almost as dearly loved to hear the brave 
deeds of Frenchmen in war. Her mother 
would rehearse these legends while spinning ; 
and the little, glowing-faced maid would listen 



while her heart swelled. But though she felt 
intensely, she was a reticent child. No doubt 
the worthy Isambeau, or Mere D'Arc, some- 
times whispered to a confidant that Joan " was 
never one to talk, but as good and willing a 
child as ever breathed," for, after all, vary 
the idiom, and the language of mothers is the 
same in all tongues and all generations. Per- 
haps, had the mother lived she might have per- 
suaded Joan out of her visions which had 
been the better for Mere d' Arc's daughter, and 
the worse for France. 

It was a strange, heavy time, a time of 
dreams and portents, a time of misery in many 
forms. There had been famines and horri- 
ble new diseases. The crazed and starving 
peasants had risen in revolt, aimlessly striking 
at the nearest, rushing about like mad dogs, 
biting, and being at last hunted down, at the 
end of a useless, brutal, bloody struggle. There 
were two popes, and religion itself seemed 
shaken. Society was in a ferment. In such 
times superstition flourishes. To Frenchmen 
especially, the day was full of bitterness. The 
French king had been stripped of his provinces 
until there remained to the dauphin, north of 
the Loire, only " a pitiful half-dozen places." 
No wonder visions came to the French maiden 
whose heart was hot with brooding over the 
humiliation of her country ! Whatever they 
were and we need not follow Michelet into 
an ingenious psychical dissertation, since Joan's 
character depends on their veracity not at all,. 
she undoubtedly counted them real, " and 
was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." 

It is a wonderful tale, that of her determin- 
ing to forsake all that she loved, to lead th& 
troops of the dauphin, " out of the great pity 
that she felt for the land of France "; her jour- 
ney to the dauphin, and the manner in which 
her superb enthusiasm, her modesty, and her 
natural shrewd sense conquered first the com- 
mon people (who never fail to respond, for 
good or evil, to the note of genuine and tre- 
mendous earnestness), then the soldiers and 
the nobles, last of all the priests themselves. 
Was the Maid a great general? Was she a 
leader ? Or was she simply an enthusiast who 
came at the right moment ? 

No one can read the most direct accounts 
without suspecting that Joan had a long head. 
She knew nothing of the technique of war 
which, it is to be remembered, was simpler far 
in those days than these, but she intuitively 
seized upon the wisest plan of campaign, pos- 
sibly because it was the most daring. Her per-

sonal courage is as well established as anything 
can be. Lord Ronald loves to dwell on it. 
Wounded at the siege of Orleans, she pulled 
out the arrow with her own hands, and then 
(having piously made her confession) returned 
to the fray and inspired the wavering soldiers. 
At Jargeau, 

" A stone from a catapult struck Joan on the helmet as 
she was in the act of mounting a ladder she fell back, 
stunned, into the ditch, but soon revived, and rising, 
with her undaunted courage, she turned to hearten her 
followers, declaring that the victory would be theirs. 
In a few moments the place was in possession of the 
French." 

At Troyes, the king, considering attack of so 
strongly fortified a place hopeless, would have 
abandoned the expedition to Rheims (since he 
dared not leave such a hornets' nest in his 
rear) ; but Joan pushed on the preparations for 
attack with such ingenious and overwhelming 
energy that the citizens of Troyes surrendered 
without a blow. Thus Charles advanced to 
Rheims, and was crowned King of France. No 
wonder her biographer exclaims enthusiastically: 

" How had she been able not only to learn the tactics 
of a campaign, the rudiments of the art of war, but even 
the art itself ? No one had shown a keener eye for se- 
lecting the weakest place to attack, or where artillery 
and culverin fire could be used with most effect, or had 
been quicker to avail himself of these weapons. No 
one saw with greater rapidity (that rarest of military 
gifts) when the decisive moment had arrived for a 
sudden attack, or had a better judgment for the right 
moment to head a charge and assault." 

And he adds that the professional soldiers about 
her could only explain her victories by the be- 
lief " that in Joan of Arc was united not only 
the soul of patriotism and a faith to move 
mountains, but the qualities of a great captain 
as well." 

All testimony agrees that Joan was more 
than a narrow zealot. She had nothing of the 
furious, almost venomous, partisanship that 
sometimes darkens her sex's devotion to a cause. 
Because she was a French patriot she was not 
therefore a hater of the English. Memoirs of 
her are full of her compassion for the foe. She 
ministered to the English wounded after the 
fight ; " as far as she could, she prevented pil- 
lage "; even in the fury of battle she restrained 
her followers. Indeed, as Lord Ronald says, 
" she may be considered the precursor of all 
the noble hearts who in modern warfare follow 
armies in order to alleviate and help the sick 
and wounded." This were enough, had Joan 
no other claim on our reverence, to win it. 
The peasant from Domremy was the first of 
the Red Cross knights. 



Even at this distant time, it is a painful task 
to follow the cruel ending of the story. The 
intrigues of jealous courtiers and of unsuccess- 
ful and envious captains on the French side 
helped the open enmity of the English. Their 
motives are clear enough : to discredit Charles's 
title, their only hope was to show that the Maid 
was a witch, thus putting the king in the odious 
position of being in collusion with the powers 
of evil. Joan was wounded, captured, sold to 
the English ; and the ensuing drama was in- 
evitable. She was tried as a sorceress. Lord 
Ronald quotes very fully from the notes of the 
proces-verbal, and it is interesting to see, even 
in this record of her enemies, how clearly the 
large sense and elevation of mind of this wonder- 
ful girl appear. When asked in what language 
her voices conversed, " They speak to me in 
soft and beautiful French voices," said she. 
" Does not Saint Margaret speak in English ? " 
was the instant inquiry. " How should she," 
was her answer, " when she is not on the En- 
glish side ? " 

She disclaimed anything miraculous in the 
revival of an apparently dead infant because of 
her prayers ; she said, as she had said at the 
time when the populace besought her to cure 
sickness by the touch of her rings, that she 
could not cure the sick. She refused steadily 
to betray anything that might harm the king, 
who had made no effort to save her. Once 
Beaupere asked her the usual mediaeval test 
question, whether she was in a state of grace. 
She avoided the presumption of confidence and 
the danger of denial in much the same manner 
that an English martyr did later, answering : 
" If I am not, may God place me in it ; if I 
am already, may He keep me in it." When 
asked what she thought of the murder of the 
Duke of Orleans, she answered out of a pure 
and merciful heart; and no statesman could 
have spoken more wisely, since she neither in- 
culpates Charles nor approves the infamous 
act. She said : " It was a great misfortune 
for the kingdom of France." 

But where the victim is condemned before- 
hand, what avails defence ? There is no need 
to repeat the brutal and treacherous devices of 
Beauvais. He was paid his price and earned 
his wages. Baffled by Joan's constancy, her 
enemies did not scruple to resort to torture as 
a persuader of confession. They brought Joan 
to the rack ; and there are few nobler answers 
than the words spoken by this lonely girl, de- 
serted by all except her dauntless soul, sick 
and feeble, and exhausted by a most cruel im-

prisonment. " Even," she said, " if you tear 
me limb from limb, and even if you kill me, I 
will not tell you anything further. And even 
were I forced to do so, I should afterwards de- 
clare that it was only because of the torture 
that I had spoken differently." 

But when fear failed, fraud succeeded. Just 
what happened at the stake, where Joan was 
persuaded to make what was proclaimed by the 
English to be a recantation, it is difficult to de- 
cide. De Quincey vehemently rejects the " cal- 
umny," as he calls it. Michelet believes that 
she tried to save her life ; " whether she said 
the word, is uncertain ; but 1 affirm that she 
thought it," is his phrase. But Michelet had 
his own theories of women, which it was ne- 
cessary to his peace of mind that he should 
support in the case of every woman ; and a 
little twisting was sometimes necessary. It 
appears from obtainable evidence that Joan, 

how worked upon, who shall say ? did put 
her mark to something that day in the square 
at Rouen, when she was brought to the stake 
and taken away. In view of her courage be- 
fore and of her fortitude afterward, the most 
likely solution is that she was as much tricked 
as bullied into an abjuration that she only half 
comprehended. Certain it is that she seems to 
have believed herself to have only promised to 
abandon her man's dress and to submit herself 
to the will of the church. Cochon's plot appears 
the more atrocious the more it is investigated. 
The unfortunate girl protected her modesty at 
the cost of her life. She resumed the man's 
dress that she was forbidden to wear; and 
whether the danger were real, or only a base 
threat, it was equally efficacious. Joan was 
brought before her judges. She admitted that 
she had seen her supernatural guides, that they 
had told her that she had " commited a bad 
deed " in denying what she had done. " Then," 
cried the bishop, "you retract your abjura- 
tion? " "It was," said Joan and this is the 
clearest testimony we have on the vexed subject 

"it was from the fear of being burnt that I re- 
tracted what I had done ; but I never intended to 
deny or revoke my voices." And when Cochon 
asked her if she no longer dreaded being burnt, 
she answered, " I had rather die than endure any 
longer what I have now to undergo." Where- 
upon Cochon fared gaily to Warwick and said 
to him in English, " You can dine now with a 
good appetite. We have caught her at last." 
On the 30th of May, 1431, the next day but 
one, Joan of Arc met her dreadful fate. She 
died with a patience and constancy the first 



natural recoil past that affected even her 
judges and made an indelible impression on the 
weeping spectators. And not only on the spec- 
tators : the imagination of France has never 
been more deeply stirred. Twenty years later, 
the French clergy, after a solemn trial, reha- 
bilitated the memory of Joan. Her family was 
ennobled, and monuments were erected by the 
king to the giver of his crown : a tardy jus- 
tice, to which, however, was added what Joan 
would have valued more than all the endur- 
ing love of her countrymen. 

Lord Gower's book is printed and illustrated 
sumptuously ; the etched illustrations of the 
scenes of the story being supplied by Mr. Lee 
Latrobe Bateman, who made the sketches from 
the spot during a pious journey which Lord 
Ronald and he made together to the scenes of 
Joan's life. It is seldom, I may add, that one 
leaves a work of history with a feeling of more 
confidence in the research, judgment, and con- 
scientious fidelity of the historian. 

OCTAVE THANET. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The two volumes of " Studies of the 

Greek Poets ''.' b y the lat f J - A -. sy- 

monds, have just been reissued in a 
stately third edition (Macmillan), with a few 
changes from earlier forms of the text. Of these 
changes, the only one at all noteworthy is the new 
chapter upon the recently discovered mimes of He- 
rondas, which includes long translated passages. 
The chapters have been arranged in a better chrono- 
logical order than before, some further translations 
have been inserted, and an occasional footnote ap- 
pended. In one of these foot-notes, the author 
gives his reasons for not re-casting more fully the 
text of the work. "Owing to the way in which 
they were first composed, it is impossible to avoid 
a certain amount of repetition without a laborious 
re-casting and re-writing of all the chapters. That 
would involve a thorough-going change of style, and 
would deprive the work of the one quality it claims 
youthfulness." We think it best, on the whole, 
that such a revision should not have been attempted, 
for the " youthfulness " of the work that is, its 
spirit of generous enthusiasm for its subject is the 
very quality that has made it the most useful, if not 
the most important, of the author's many books. 
For young readers, whether students of Greek or 
not, these chapters offer the best introduction in our 
language to the study of Greek literature ; and in 
these days, when the value of that study is ques- 
tioned more than ever before, such books are capa- 
ble of doing a world of good. We do not know, 
either, that the author's riper judgment could have

THE DIAL

given better form to the general conclusions result- 
ing from the study of Greek thought as expressed 
in Greek poetry. Such a passage as the following, 
for example, is wholly admirable : " We must imi- 
tate the Greeks, not by trying to reproduce their 
bygone modes of life and feeling, but by approxi- 
mating to their free and fearless attitude of mind. 
While frankly recognizing that much of their lib- 
erty would for us be license, and that the moral 
progress of the race depends on holding with a firm 
grasp what the Greeks had hardly apprehended, we 
ought still to emulate their spirit by cheerfully ac- 
cepting the world as we find it, acknowledging the 
value of each human impulse, and aiming after vir- 
tues that depend on self-regulation rather than on 
total abstinence and mortification. To do this in 
the midst of our conventionalities and prejudices, 
our interminglement of unproved expectations and 
unrefuted terrors, is no doubt hard. Yet if we fail 
of this, we lose the best the Greeks can teach us." 
A book so sane in its essential doctrine may well be 
pardoned a few outbursts of florid rhetoric and a 
certain amount of exuberant verbosity. It is doubt- 
less open to much minor criticism, as, for example, 
in the passage which speaks of Moliere's " courtly 
and polished treatment of disgusting subjects" a 
comment that does not come with good grace from 
one who censures Hallam for precisely the same 
sort of comment upon Marlowe ; but criticism of 
this sort we are willing to forego, contenting our- 
selves with an emphatic protest against the publica- 
tion of such a work without an index. 



... .. Mr. William Renton's " Outlines of 

A diagrammatic . . . 

treatment of English Literature (Scribner) is a 

English Literature. University Extension Manual," 

and, as such, hardly appears to fulfil its purpose. 
As an introduction to the subject it would be found 
confusing, although it has much suggestiveness for 
readers who already know the history of our liter- 
ature. Its defect, as far as beginners are concerned, 
is found in its insistence upon a rather obscure sys- 
tem of philosophical classification and criticism. 
It professes to deal with types, schools, and epochs 
rather than with individuals, but the interest of the 
beginner is only to be awakened by an extremely 
individual method of treatment. He is told, for 
example, that Marlowe's chief discovery was " that 
in the universal and a posteriori, not the excep- 
tional and the a priori, is to be found the true source 
of human interest and interpretation " from 
which statement he is not likely to learn much. 
Mr. Renton makes use of many ingenious formu- 
las and diagrams in illustration of his subject. The 
formula for Shakespeare, for example, is this : 
(s -j- p) S -j- (v -(- h ) T, which, being interpreted, 
means " spontaneity and pregnancy of Suggestion 
combined with variety and harmony of Treatment." 
When the scientific treatment of literature culmi- 
nates in such pseudo-mathematical forms of expres- 
sion, it is time to call a halt. The variety and in- 
genuity of the author's diagrams for he makes 



much use of the graphic method, as well as of the 
algebraical defy any attempt at mere description. 
One of the less complicated of the figures gives 
us the abstraction Nature as a centre, and groups 
about it, at quadrant intervals, the four other ab- 
stractions, Will, Soul, Sense, and Spirit. The names 
of eight nineteenth century poets link together the 
circles representing these abstractions ; thus, Byron 
is the poet of Nature and Will, Shelley of Nature 
and Soul, Keats of Nature and Sense, Wordsworth 
of Nature and Spirit. In an outer circle, Spirit is 
linked with Will by Mr. Roden Noel (whose name 
had to be dragged in for the sake of diagrammatic 
symmetry), Will with Soul by Browning, Soul with 
Sense by Mr. Swinburne, and Sense with Spirit by 
Tennyson. The description of such a diagram is 
its best reductio ad absurdam. The structure of 
literature is too organic to admit of being thus me- 
chanically explained. The author seems to be 
fairly accurate as to historical fact and sane as to 
criticism, although we do not agree with him in 
making Balzac inferior to Thackeray, in singling 
out Mr. Swinburne's " Tristram of Lyonesse " as 
one of the poet's most remarkable works, or in a. 
number of other and minor matters. And it is at 
least amusing to be told that Berkeley, in " The 
Querist," " anticipated the Political Economy of 
Smith and Ruskin." Mr. Ruskin would not thank 
the author for that. 

Sismondi's "Rdpubliques Italiennes," 

A condensed , H . i 

history of the in ten volumes, albeit a work which 
Italian Republic,. fagcinateS5 is some what formidable to 

one who is seeking a general knowledge of the Ital- 
ian city republics of the middle ages. Miss Duffy 
has done well to give us a portion of all this in a 
single volume, in her " Tuscan Republics and Ge- 
noa" (Putnam). Considering the length of cen- 
turies that she deals with, and the lack of unity 
involved in a history of five states Genoa, Pisa, 
Lucca, Florence, and Siena, she has produced a. 
very successful narrative. She truly emphasizes 
the fact that communal institutions here did not 
come down from the Roman time, but sprang up 
amid the confusion and neglect of the Germanic 
settlements and the early feudal period. Florence, 
as is right, gets the largest treatment, and the 
narrative is well handled as it passes from consuls 
to podestas, podestas to Signoria, and as the power 
is snatched by popolani from grandi, only to be 
handed over to Medici patrons and tyrants. It is a 
pity there is much slovenly writing in the volume, for 
a good book is worth making slowly. Such writing 
as, " In other places, notable in Lombardy," " con- 
ferred sole possession to the property," "Pisa's 
wealth and outlaying interests," "a change came 
over the government," is not creditable. An inter- 
preter is needed for such sentences as, " Florence 
owed its final great prosperity to its position mid- 
way between the Mediterranean coast and Rome " 
(a map will not elucidate it), or "Henry IV. had 
conferred on Lucca the privilege of trading freely 



72 



[Aug. 1, 



throughout his dominions, and this fact explains the 
passionate jealousy of Pisa, which, desirous of ex- 
panding inland, found an insurmountable obstacle 
to this aspiration of its neighbor." One would 
wish to have seen a fuller account of Siena and 
some recognition of Arezzo in a Tuscan history. 

. .. " Women of the Valois Court" (Scrib- 

More portraits . . . < r t_ 

of women of the ner) is the initial volume of a fresh 
sub-series by the indefatigable M. 
Imbert de Saint- Amand. The volumes differ from 
their predecessors in that their interest is still more 
largely personal, each one containing a series of 
detached historical portraits. In the number before 
us, for instance, there are portraits, pictorial as well 
as verbal, of Marguerite of Angouleme and Cather- 
ine de' Medici, and, subordinately, of Diane de 
Poitiers, Marguerite of Valois, Marie Stuart, and 
others. The author's style is as showy and vivacious 
as ever, and he has interwoven in his own narrative 
the usual proportion of quotations from the author- 
ities, and from diaries and letters, of the period. 
Balzac's opinion of Catherine is sufficiently striking. 
Nothing, not even Saint Bartholomew's, gives him 
pause in his enthusiasm for his heroine. In his 
eyes, " the figure of Catherine de' Medici appears 
like that of a great king. The calumnies once dis- 
pelled by facts, recovered with difficulty from the 
falsities and contradictions of pamphlets and anec- 
dotes, everything can be explained to the honor 
of this extraordinary woman, who had none of the 
weaknesses of her sex, who lived chastely in the 
midst of the amours of the most licentious court of 
Europe, and who, in spite of her meagre purse, was 
able to build admirable monuments, as if to repair 
the losses occasioned by the demolitions of the Cal- 
vinists, who inflicted as many wounds on art as on 
the body politic." The extracts in the volume, 
brought thus together in compact and accessible 
form, are of great value to the student. The book 
is withal full of romantic interest, and is more read- 
able than the general run of books that profess to 
be nothing else. 

In " Orthometry " (Putnam), Mr. 

R - F * Brewer has attempted a fuller 
treatment of the art of versification 
than is to be found in the popular treatises on that 
subject. While the preface shows a tendency to 
encourage verse-making, as unnecessary as it is un- 
desirable, the work may be regarded as useful in 
so far as it tends to cultivate an intelligent taste 
for good poetry. The rhyming dictionary at the 
end is a new feature, which will undoubtedly com- 
mend itself to those having a use for such aids. A 
specially interesting chapter is that on "Poetic 
Trifles," in which are included the various imita- 
tions of foreign verse in English. The discussion 
of the sonnet, too, though failing to bring out fully 
the spiritual nature of this difficult verse form, is 
more accurate than might be expected from the 
following sentence : " The form of the sonnet is of 
Italian origin, and came into use in the fifteenth 



[sic] century, towards the end of which its con- 
struction was perfected, and its utmost melodious 
sweetness attained in the verse of Petrarch and 
Dante." In the chapter on Alliteration there are 
several misleading statements, such as calling " Piers 
the Plowman " an " Old English " poem. In the 
bibliography one is surprised not to find Mr. F. B. 
Gummere's admirable " Handbook of Poetics," now 
in its third edition. In spite of these and other 
shortcomings, which can be readily corrected in a 
later issue, this work may be recommended as a sat- 
isfactory treatment of the mechanics of verse.

the Hebrew text of or less of the translation of the 
** Old Testament writings, undertaken 
sometime since by a group of the most eminent 
European and American Semitic scholars, and al-

enterprise have also included in their plans the pub- 
lication of the complete Hebrew text of the Old 
Testament, in a series of volumes to be the exact 
counterparts of those making up the English edi- 
tion. There will be twenty of these parts altogether, 
and, through the generosity of an unnamed friend 
of the enterprise, they are offered to subscribers at 
a very low price. Part the first, containing the text 
of the book of Job, edited by Professor Siegfried, 
of Jena, has just been issued, and, in its Leipzig 
typography, is a very beautiful piece of work. The 
text is printed in colors by a new process, the in- 
vention of Professor Haupt, the general editor of 
the series. Interpolations and parallel compositions 
are thus distinguished from the primitive portions 
of the text, a feature which those who use the book 
will not be slow to appreciate. The text has been 
left unpointed except in ambiguous cases. The 
Johns Hopkins Press is the American agent for 
this work, and will receive subscriptions for the 
whole work or for the separate parts as issued. 

Volume 17 of " The Adventure Se- 
NarraJiive of a rieg / Macmillan) contains a reprint

of Nicholson s translation (1790) of 
Count de Benyowsky's " Memoirs and Travels in 
Siberia, Kamchatka, Japan, the Liukiu Islands, and 
Formosa." The book is edited by Captain Pasfield 
Oliver, who, in his exhaustive Introduction, devotes 
himself to the rather unusual editorial task of pick- 
ing holes in his author's narrative and impugning 
his veracity. Benyowsky was a Polish adventurer 
of the eighteenth century, one of those " plausible, 
amusing, and good-looking, but wholly unprincipled, 
Don Juans," says Captain Oliver, " who would 
fight under any leader where plunder was to be 
gained." He was taken prisoner by the Russians 
in 1769, but escaped shortly after and made his 
way to Kamchatka, from whence he sailed on his zig- 
za gg m g voyage in Behring Sea, the Sea of Ochotsk, 
and the North Pacific, arriving at Macao, after 
a series of remarkable " adventures " which form 
the basis of his narrative, in 1771. Judging from

internal evidence, and from discrepancies pointed 
out by the diligent and skeptical editor, the Count 
was almost as gifted a liar as Miinchausen. Cer- 
tainly he was a more plausible one, for his story has 
provoked much learned discussion. The "Memoir" 
is something of a literary curiosity, and it may still 
be read with interest. There are several plates, in- 
cluding a portrait of the author. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

PRINCETON COLLEGE is rich in historical memories, 
and Mr. George R. Wallace, a recent graduate, has 
taken advantage of this fact in his volume of " Prince- 
ton Sketches" (Putnam). Mr. Wallace relates many 
episodes in the history of Princeton, from the reign of 
Dickinson to the reign of McCosh, and illustrates them 
with facsimiles of old documents and photographs of 
modern buildings. " The Princeton Idea " is the sub- 
ject of the closing chapter, and, as expounded by the 
author, an excellent idea it appears to be. 

"APPLE-TONS' General Guide to the United States 
and Canada " for the year 1893, not greatly changed from 
former editions (except for an illustrated World's Fair 
appendix), makes its appearance in time for the uses of 
the summer tourist. The same publishers send us their 
new " Guide-Book to Alaska and the Northwest Coast," 
a work prepared by Miss Eliza Kuhamah Scidmore, and 
uniform with the two volumes of the " Canadian Guide- 
Book " of Messrs. Roberts and Ingersoll. These books 
are illustrated, which we think is a mistake, and their 
maps and plans leave much to be desired. 

THE " Latin Lessons " (Houghton) of Messrs. Henry 
Preble and Lawrence C. Hull, are " designed to prepare 
for the intelligent reading of classical Latin prose." 
They are based upon the standard grammars (Andrews 
and Stoddard, Allen and Greenough, Gildersleeve, Hark- 
ness) , but may be used independently of any other book. 
There is an extensive vocabulary. Mr. A. S. Cook has 
edited Leigh Hunt's "What is Poetry ? " (Ginn) for the 
use of students of English. The latest modern language 
texts are " Le Piano de Jeanne " and " Qui Perd Gagne " 
(Sower Co.), by M. Francisque Sarcey edited by Mr. Ed- 
ward H. Magill, and " L'Histoire de la Mere Michel et 
de Son Chat" (Heath), by M. de la Bedolliere, edited 
by Mr. W. H. Wrench. 

THE " Shrubs of Northeastern America " (Putnam), 
by Mr. Charles S. Newhall, is a companion volume to 
the author's handbook of our native trees, published two 
years or so ago. The analytical guides, three in num- 
ber (based on flowers, leaves, and fruit), are simple and 
adequate. There are over a hundred pages of outline 
illustrations. Thirty-four orders are represented, and 
more than twice that number of genera. Mr. Newhall 
is preparing a similar work on vines. The amateur 
botanist has much reason to be grateful to the author 
for these helpful handbooks. 

VOLUME XXXV. of the "Dictionary of National 
Biography " (Macmillan) extends from MacCarwell to 
Maltby. The " Macs " get the major share of the arti- 
cles, and among them we note Macduff, Earl of Fife 
(whose name seems strange enough in this connection), 
Macready, and James Macpherson. Later in the vol- 
ume come Father Prout, Sir Henry Maine, and Sir 
Thomas Malory, three worthies whom one does not 
usually think of grouping together. 



" WHITTIER with the Children," by Miss Margaret 
Sidney, and " A Song of the Christ," by Miss Harriet 
Adams Sawyer, are two pretty gift-books published by 
the D. Lothrop Co. The former is in prose and the 
latter in verse, and both are illustrated. " An Octave 
to Mary " (Murphy), by Mr. John B. Tabb, is also a 
gift-book, oblong in shape and comprising eight simple 
religious poems. The booklet is given distinction by 
its frontispiece, which reproduces in photogravure an 
"Annunciation" by Mr. E. Burne-Jones. 

" SHIRLEY," in two volumes, follows " Jane Eyre " in 
the exquisite Dent edition of the Brontes. Mr. William 
Black's " Yolande " and " Judith Shakespeare " (the lat- 
ter one of his three or four most successful novels) are 
the latest additions to the popular Harper reprint of his 
works. And at last, with illustrations by Mr. Gordon 
Browne, appears " Ivanhoe " in the Dryburgh " Wa- 
verly," published by the Macmillans. 



IJITERARY NOTES AND NEWS. 



The death of Mr. Wilson Graham, who undertook 
five years ago the preparation of the Chaucer Concord- 
ance, leaves the completion of the work to his colleague, 
Dr. Fliigel, of Stanford University, to whom all out- 
standing slips should now be sent. 

At the Zola dinner mentioned in our last issue, the 
following bit of dialogue is reported to have taken 
place: General Jung said to M. Zola, "You have writ- 
ten ' La De"bkcle '; I hope you will write La Victoire.' " 
M. Zola replied, " That, General, is more your business 
than mine." 

The following inscription is borne by the tablet re- 
cently placed upon the Palazzo Verospi, at Rome : " A 
Percy Bysshe Shelley, che nella primavera del 1819 
scrisse in questa casa ' H Prometeo ' e ' La Cenci.' II 
Comune di Roma, cento anni dopo la nascita del poeta, 
sostenitore invitto delle liberta popolati, avversate ai 
sui tempi da tutta Europa, pose questo ricordo, 1892." 

One Babu Sarat Chandra Das, a Bengali pundit, who 
lived for some time in a Buddhist monastery at Lhassa, 
and who brought back with him a thorough knowledge 
of Tibetan language and literature, is now engaged upon 
an exhaustive dictionary of Tibetan, to be published by 
the government of India. He has also found time to 
write a popular narrative of his travels and experiences 
in Tibet, and thus throw open to English readers a 
country that has been closed for more than a century. 

The death-roll for July includes two names of high 

rank, that of Guy de Maupassant, who died on the 

6th, and that of Henry Nettleship, whose death was re- 
ported on the 10th. Maupassant was born in 1850, 
trained himself for literary work under the direction of 
Flaubert, and during the last dozen years of his life 
was a prolific writer of novels and short stories always 
admirable in manner, often far from admirable in mat- 
ter. The story of his illness is too fresh in the public 
mind to need recounting. Professor Nettleship had not 
more than three or four equals among recent classical 
scholars in England. He was born in 1839, and was 
identified with Oxford throughout the greater part of 
his career. In 1878, he became Corpus Professor of 
Latin, thus filling the chair formerly occupied by his 
old master and friend, Professor Conington. He com- 
pleted Conington's " Virgil " and " Persius," published

many papers on classical philology, and devoted many 
years to a proposed Latin-English lexicon, planned, then 
afterwards abandoned, by the Clarendon Press. 

Mr. Walter Besant, the English novelist, who attended 
the recent Authors' Congress at Chicago as a delegate 
from the British Society of Authors, has written the fol- 
lowing appreciative letter to the President of the Aux- 
iliary Congresses, by whom it is given to the public. 

CHARLES C. DONKEY, Esq., 

President World's Congress Auxiliary. 

DEAR SIR : At the moment of leaving Chicago and the 
Literary Conference, I beg permission, in the name of Dr. 
Sprigge and myself, and of the organization which we repre- 
sented at your Congress, to convey to you as president, and 
to the committee of organization of the Literary department, 
first, our most sincere congratulations on the success of the 
Congress which is to-day concluded ; second, our most sin- 
cere thanks for the arrangements made for the reception of 
the English contributors, and for the great personal kindness 
shown to us and the trouble taken for us. 

Many papers were read most helpful and suggestive ; a great 
stimulus has been given to the consideration of all subjects 
connected with the advance of our common literature a lit- 
erature growing daily more international, while on both sides 
of the Atlantic it will preserve its natural distinctions. I ven- 
ture to express the earnest hope that in the interests of both 
countries the papers read and the speeches made during this 
week may be edited i. e., reduced and condensed and pub- 
lished, and sent to all the principal libraries in the world of 
the Republic and the English Empire. 

Permit me, sir, if I may do so as a simple visitor, without 
the appearance of impertinence, to congratulate your splendid 
city on the place which this Exposition has enabled it to take 
among the great mother cities of the world. Among all your 
business activities, and in the eager pressing forward of your 
people, rejoicing in a vigorous youth, confident in a splendid 
future, reckless of what they spend because of the strength 
and resources within them, I rejoice to find springing up a 
new literature. Whatever be the future of this literature, 
which rises on the frontier line of East and West, it will be at 
least free from the old traditions. I wish for your authors 
that independence which we in the old country are straggling 
to conquer ; at least it will be their fault if they do not 
achieve it at the outset not the fault of the national char- 
acter, nor the fault of this Literary Congress. 

I leave your city with memories of the greatest kindness 
and hospitality. I can never sufficiently thank my friends 
here for their friendliness. I carry away a delightful memory, 
not so much of a Chicago rich, daring, young, and confident, 
as of a Chicago which has conceived and carried into execu- 
tion the most beautiful and poetic dream a place surpassing 
the imagination of man, as man is commonly found and a 
Chicago loving the old literature, discerning and proving that 
which is new, and laying the foundations for that which is to 
come, a Chicago which is destined to become the centre of 
American literature in the future. 

I remain, dear sir, your obedient servant, 

WALTER BESANT.

SOME STANDARD BOOKS. 



PERSIAN LITERATURE. 

ANCIENT AND MODERN. By ELIZABETH A. REED, Member 
of the Philosophical Society of Great Britain and of the 
International Congress of Orientalists. 1 vol., cloth, $2.50. 
This volume traces the growth and development of the lit- 
erature of Persia from its origin, 4000 years ago, to the pres- 
ent century. It contains the philosophy, language, literature, 
and religion of the Persians, as found in their poems, histo- 
ries, and laws, in chronological order and attractive form. A 
fac-simile of the illuminated title-page of a Persian manu- 
script of great value enriches the volume ; and, through the 
courtesy of Prof. Max Miiller, the book has, in fac-simile, a 
portion of one of the oldest-known Zend manuscripts, the 
original being now in the University of Oxford. 
DR. GEORG EBERS, Professor of Egyptian Language and Archeology, 
University of Leipsic, says : 

" I took your ' Persian Literature ' at puce in liaiul and read it right 
through. I am much pleased with it. It is a beautiful book, and charm- 
ingly inspiring even for one who is not a specialist in Persian literature. 
Many of your translations are eminently successful." 

" It embodies not alone the cream of all that has been published on 
the subject, but also much of the unpublished results of late research 
which the author has gleaned through correspondence with the foremost 
Oriental scholars of Europe." Public Opinion (Washington, D. C.). 



HINDU LITERATURE; 

OK, THE ANCIENT BOOKS OF INDIA. By ELIZABETH A. 

REED, author of " Persian Literature." 1 vol., $2.00. 

" In this handsomely printed volume we have a full and sympathetic 
conspectus of Hindu literature, and especially of the ancient books of 
India. Mrs. Reed has made herself thoroughly familiar with the work 
done by the original delvers in the mine of Aryan lore. Her pages are 
full of fascination, her comments are clear and pertinent, her diction is 
excellent, and the most important parts of her book have been anno- 
tated or revised by Sanskrit scholars whose names have world-wide 
fame." The Literary World (Boston). 



THE ARYAN RACE: 

ITS ORIGIN AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS. By CHARLES MORRIS, 
author of "A Manual of Classical Literature." 1 vol., 
'55 pages. Second Edition. $1.50. 

"A thorough and comprehensive familiarity with the subject, a 
happy faculty of discrimination between important and relatively unim- 
portant matter, combined with faultless diction, unite to make this a 
veritable English classic." Public Opinion (Washington, D. C.). 



SPARKS FROM A GEOLOGIST'S HAMMER 

By ALEXANDER WINCHELL, LL.D. Third Edition. 1 vol., 

Illustrated, cloth, $2.00. 

" In these essays Dr. Winchell again proves his claim to be ranked 
with Professor Proctor as one of the most brilliant and popular ex- 
pounders of modern science." Canadian Methodist Monthly. 



THE YOUTH OF FREDERICK THE GREAT 

By ERNEST LAVISSE, Professor at the Sorbonne, Paris. 
Translated from the French by MARY BUSHNELL COLE- 
MAN. 1 vol., 462 pages, cloth, $2.00. 

" There can be only admiration for the clearness with which the au- 
thor has depicted his characters as he understands them. The minutest 
detail that helps to flll out the picture is remembered. The book is well 
translated. The hardships of Frederick's youth make his figure a ro- 
mantic one in spite of his own sternness in later life. In this volume 
you have the romance without the bitterness of complete disillusion." 
New York Tribune. 

MANUAL OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE. 

Comprising Biographical and Critical Notices of the Principal 
Greek and Roman authors, with illustrative extracts for 
popular reading. By CHARLES MORRIS. 420 pages, $1.50. 
" The author has been particularly successful in preparing a book for 
readers who, not having had the advantages of a classical course of 
study, would nevertheless gain an intelligent insight into the world's 
most remarkable uninspired ancient thought and speech. " The Ad- 
vance (Chicago). 

"The book presents a more complete survey of classical literature 
than can elsewhere be found in the same compass." Scotsman (Edin- 
burgh, Scotland). 

PREADAMITES ; 

OR, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF MEN BEFORE 
ADAM. By ALEXANDER WINCHELL, LL.D. 1 vol., 8vo, 
553 pages, with Ethnographic Maps and numerous Illustra- 
tions, $3.50. 

Fifth edition, enlarged by the addition of twenty-five pages 
of supplementary notes and citations, representing the move- 
ment of scientific opinion during the past ten years in rela- 
tion to themes discussed in this work. 

"There has been no work published upon the subject which can 
compare with this in importance. It is the fruit of an exhaustive 
study, not of one but of all the sources of information which can be sup- 
posed to throw light upon the subject. Dr. Winchell deals fairly and 
honestly with facts, and neglects no source of information that is open 
to him. His argument is elaborate and many-sided. The comparative 
novelty of his attempt may be trusted to win for the work the widest 
attention on the one hand, and the most critical scrutiny on the other. " 
New York Evening Post. 



WORLD LIFE ; or, Comparative Geology. 

Third Edition. Illustrated, 666 pages, cloth, $2.50. 

A study of the formation, growth, and decay of worlds from 
their earliest existence as nebulous masses diffused through 
space to their development into sun and world systems, and 
their final dissolution. 

"We know of no other work in which the reader can find a full, con- 
nected and systematic presentation of the results of cosmical research 
that will compare with this." Popular Science Monthly.

A NEWSPAPER SYMPOSIUM. 

A group of articles upon the subject of 
American Journalism, published in the August 
"Forum," offers no little food for reflection. 
The continuous degradation of the American 
newspaper has long been admitted by all who 
are competent to express an opinion upon the 
subject ; it would be difficult to-day to find an 
intelligent and disinterested observer who would 



make, otherwise than as a hypocritical pre- 
tence, the claim that our average newspaper is 
in any sense a leader of public opinion. Even 
those who, engaged in the " new journalism,' 7 
attempt its defence, are growing bold enough 
to cast off the mask, and cynically to disavow 
all aims not comprised within such terms as. 
" popularity," " commercial success," and " un- 
precedented circulation." Most of them are 
frank enough to admit that these considera- 
tions are the only ones to be seriously taken 
into account, and that the work of newspaper 
production is, like the work of the dealer in 
real-estate or of the stock-broker, essentially a 
form of money-getting. 

The fact is, of course, as all persons will ad- 
mit whose moral perceptions are not hopelessly 
blunted, that the profession of the journalist 
carries with it certain inseparable responsibil- 
ities, and that to ignore these responsibilities, 
or to take refuge behind the fact that the law 
(that excellent but necessarily imperfect rule 
of conduct) does not enforce them, is simply 
to set morality at defiance. In all occupations, 
indeed, there are ethical as well as legal limi- 
tations upon freedom of action ; but in the 
professions (and journalism surely ought to be 
numbered among them) the limitations im- 
posed by ethics are peculiarly obvious and im- 
perative. The aims of the newspaper, from 
the ethical standpoint, may for convenience be 
classified under three heads : 1. As a collector 
of news, pure and simple, its work should be 
done in the scientific spirit, placing accuracy 
of statement above all other considerations. 

2. In its selection and arrangement of the news 
thus collected, it should have regard to real 
rather than sensational values ; it should pre- 
sent its facts in their proper perspective (which 
is still, of course, a very different perspective 
from that required by permanent history); and 
it should carefully exclude, or at least mini- 
mize to the utmost, those facts which it cannot 
possibly benefit the public to know, or of which 
the knowledge is likely to vulgarize popular 
taste and lower popular standards of morality. 

3. In its comment upon the happenings of the 
day or the week, it is bound to be honest, to 
stand for well-defined principles, to express the 
sincere convictions of its intellectual head and 
of those associated with him in the work.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



Judged by these tests (and who, without 
abandoning the ethical standpoint altogether, 
will deny their fairness ?), there are few news- 
papers in the country that will not be found 
wanting. In fact, no serious attempt is likely 
to be made to defend the American newspaper 
upon any such grounds as we have presented. 
The " practical newspaper man " will answer 
them, and probably think the reply convincing, 
in some such fashion as follows : Of the first 
requirement he will say that an inaccurate and 
distorted report of an occurrence is better than 
no report at all ; that the public must, in any 
event, be given something to read upon the 
subject. Of the second requirement he will 
say that the public must be regaled with read- 
ing to its taste, no matter how trivial, how 
shocking, or how filthy the subject-matter. Of 
the third requirement he will probably say 
that the exigencies of partisan journalism are 
incompatible with sincerity and consistency ; 
or he may be content with the brutal cynicism 
of the statement that a newspaper proprietor 
may do what he wishes with his own, making 
it a weathercock to the shifting winds of ig- 
norant popular opinion or of personal whim 
making it even the instrument of his personal 
prejudices and petty malignities. 

Such a reply as the above, of course, begs 
the ethical question altogether, and leaves the 
discussion where it started. The magazine 
symposium to which we have referred in our 
caption includes among its contributors the ed- 
itor of the New York " Times," who derides 
at the outset the notion that newspapers should 
be conducted with any reference to ethical 
standards. Yet what would the editor of the 
" Times " think of the clergyman who should 
preach a doctrine carefully selected for its pay- 
ing qualities, or even of the physician who 
should take up with what he knew to be quack- 
ery because he expected from it large financial 
returns? The newspaper certainly assumes, 
in its editorial department, the functions of 
the preacher or of the college professor in a 
social sense, even the functions of the medical 
practitioner ; is there any reason why it should 
be exempt from judgment by the same stand- 
ards? Yet this is the simple proposition of 
which the writer in question makes elephantine 
fun. " Among the mass of newspaper readers," 
he says, " I do not find any warrant for the 
assertions made with such flippancy by these 
reckless critics that newspapers are everywhere 
regarded as untrustworthy and debasing." Of 
course not ! " The mass of newspaper read- 



ers " approve of the paper so carefully ad- 
justed to their tastes, just as the patients of 
our practitioner of the " new medicine " or the 
hearers of our preacher of the " new theology " 
approve of the quackery of which they are the 
willing dupes. It is the sort of thing they like, 
and so, with admirable thoughtfulness, it is 
provided for their delectation. 

All that is said by the writer just quoted, 
beyond the dull trifling that makes up a large 
part of his article, is reducible to what we may 
call, for brevity, the counting-room argument ; 
and the force of that argument we admit with- 
out cavil. If journalism is to be considered a 
form of business, and nothing more, then the 
only proper tests of success are the daily cir- 
culation, the number of advertisements, and 
the annual balance-sheet. Those who consider 
it a profession, with inherent, peculiar, and 
far-reaching responsibilities, will prefer the 
tests that we have already designated, and will 
be aided in applying them by the two articles, 
hitherto unmentioned, of the symposium that 
suggested our present comment. One of these 
articles, by a New York newspaper writer fo 
thirteen years' experience, has for its title 
"Journalism as a Career," and offers a very 
plain-spoken statement of the conditions of 
newspaper work in our largest city. " The 
fundamental principle of metropolitan journal- 
ism," says this candid writer, " is to buy white 
paper at three cents a pound and sell it at ten 
cents a pound. And in some quarters it does 
not matter how much the virgin whiteness of 
the paper is defiled so long as the defilement 
sells the paper." The writer is not so much 
concerned with what he casually calls the " per- 
verted ethics " of modern journalism he seems 
to take them for granted as with the life of 
the newspaper worker. That life, under mod- 
ern conditions, is one that a dog would hardly 
envy, so degrading is it, in most cases, to every 
form of self-respect. The modern newspaper 
owner is described in a few pointed sentences : 
" He knows how to buy and sell, whether it be 
white paper or ink or brains. The fact that 
he may not know the first rudiments of the En- 
glish language, that sociology and political sci- 
ence are as incomprehensible to him as the 
hereafter, does not affect the case at all." 
" Editorial writers, or critics, or copy-readers, 
or reporters, are so numerous and so cheap 
that his whole editorial staff can be changed in 
a day if he deems it necessary. He despises 
the literary accomplishments of these men and 
therefore the men themselves, because he meas-

ures all men by their ability to accumulate 
money and cannot see advantage in anything not 
convertible into money." Work in the employ 
of such a person is necessarily debasing ; and 
we are glad that one of the workers has had 
the candor to speak his mind openly, and give 
us this truthful account of the humiliation at- 
tendant upon the path of the modern journal- 
ist, of the meanness, the sycophancy, and the 
intellectual dishonesty that are the chief qual- 
ifications for his success, and of the peculiar 
brutality that marks the attitude maintained 
toward him by his employer. 

The writer of the third of our series of arti- 
cles, also a journalist of long experience, boldly 
attacks the modern newspaper at the point 
where its defence is commonly supposed to be 
the strongest, and asks whether, with all its 
defects of prejudice and taste, it even succeeds 
in giving the news. The writer selects for 
comparison, taking the date at random, a copy 
of each of the four leading New York papers 
for Sunday, April 17, 1881, and copies of the 
same papers for the corresponding date of the 
present year. He analyzes and classifies their 
contents, and presents the result in neatly tab- 
ulated form. While the aggregate reading 
matter in the four papers for 1893 is about 
treble that in the papers twelve years old, it is 
noticeable that the amount of space devoted to 
art has fallen from six and a quarter to five 
and a quarter columns ; that religious mat- 
ter has declined from four and a quarter col- 
umns to half a column (in the Sunday papers 
at that !); and that literature has dropped from 
forty columns to twenty-five. When we ask 
what has taken the place of the space thus 
saved, and what fills the two hundred per cent 
of additional space, we are answered by the 
figures for scandals, sports, and gossip. Scan- 
dals have gone up from one column to seven 
and a half ; sports from seven columns to fifty ; 
and gossip from four and a half columns to 
one hundred and sixteen. The writer's final 
comment upon these astonishing figures is thus 
expressed : " There is a conventional phrase 
* a newspaper is the history of the world for a 
day ' that is more or less believed in. Noth- 
ing could be falser than this. Our newspapers 
do not record the really serious happenings, but 
only the sensations, the catastrophes of history." 

One other point made by the writer of the 
last-mentioned article demands our attention. 
In comparing the newspapers of New York 
with those of Chicago, he distinctly declares 
for the superior tone and intelligence ofj[the 



latter. While the former have been under- 
going the deterioration set forth by his con- 
vincing statistics, the latter "have distinctly 
improved in a better direction." This approval 
is, of course, only relative, and implies no claim 
that " the Chicago papers are models of pro- 
priety and good taste." On the contrary, we 
are told, " they are not even so good as the 
New York papers of twelve years ago ; but 
they are very much nicer and cleaner than the 
Chicago papers of that time or than the New 
York papers of to-day. So, while there has 
been a distinct deterioration and decadence in 
the New York newspaper press in the last 
dozen years, the improvement in Chicago has 
been steady and noteworthy, and this notwith- 
standing the introduction and general adoption 
there of the illustrations that do not illustrate." 
We are inclined to think that the approval 
thus expressed and thus carefully qualified is 
just, and it is noteworthy as the opinion of a 
New York journalist. Still more noteworthy, 
perhaps, is the endorsement of this opinion by 
the New York " Evening Post." This opinion, 
says the " Post," " we have independent evi- 
dence to believe to be well taken. That is, that 
while New York papers have degenerated, 
Western papers, particularly Chicago papers, 
have improved." The man who, more than 
any other, is responsible for the " new journal- 
ism "as it exists in New York was a West- 
erner who "brought to New York a vulgar 
standard which was then current and popular 
in the West, but which the West has since 
grown ashamed of and tried to improve." 



THE EDUCATION CONGRESSES. 

To the Education Congresses of the World's Con- 
gress Auxiliary were assigned the two weeks be- 
ginning July 17. The Congresses of the second 
week were held under the special auspices of the 
National Educational Association, but their work, 
in many of the departments, simply continued 
the work of the first week, bringing to it the re- 
enforcement of new speakers, and, to a certain ex- 
tent, of new special subjects for discussion. The 
work of the first week was organized in thirteen 
sections, and that of the second in fifteen. With 
fifteen distinct sections in session at the same time, 
as was the case during the second week, the indi- 
vidual participant found himself in a state border- 
ing upon distraction. He might easily eliminate 
from the problem a few sessions of the more spe- 
cial sort, but there still remained a considerable 
number having nearly or quite equal claims upon 
his attention. The same complication has made it

[Aug. 16, 



impossible for us to present a full report ( even had 
space permitted) of the proceedings of the Con- 
gresses ; our readers must be content with an ac- 
count of what took place at the more important of 
them, and, in some cases, with a list of the more 
distinguished speakers, and the subjects of their re- 
marks. 

The Congress on the subject of General Educa- 
tion held eleven sessions during the two weeks, all 
but the last three being planned by a committee 
having Mrs. H. M. Wilmarth as chairman. The 
subjects under discussion the first week included 
the following : " Reforms Now Practicable in Sec- 
ondary Education," " Methods of Teaching Ethics 
in Schools," " The Education of Girls," and the 
condition of education in a number of foreign coun- 
tries, Australia, Iceland, and Turkey. Monday, 
July 24, brought two very interesting sessions of 
this Congress, the first of them being given over to 
a discussion of what the public schools ought to 
teach. Among the speakers on this subject were 
Mrs. Marion Foster Washburne, who made a plea 
for the kindergarten ; Colonel Francis W. Parker, 
who stoutly defended the scientific educational 
methods called " fads " by the ignorant and indif- 
ferent ; Mr. Thomas Morgan, who infused an ele- 
ment of socialism into the discussion ; and Dr. C. 
M. Woodward, who argued for manual training. 
The second of these sessions brought more social- 
ism with Mr. Hamlin Garland, philosophy with the 
paper sent by Mr. Thomas Davidson, and practi- 
cality with General Francis A. Walker, whose ad- 
dress was the feature of the occasion. The session 
of July 25 discussed Herbartian pedagogics from 
many points of view, the speakers including Dr. 
Levi Seeley, of Lake Forest University, Professor 
Elmer E. Brown, of the University of California, 
President Charles De Garmo, of Swarthmore Col- 
lege, and Superintendent C. B. Gilbert, of St. 
Paul. The closing three sessions of this General 
Congress included addresses by Bishop Samuel Fal- 
lows, Dr. S. H. Peabody, Superintendent Albert G. 
Lane, President W. R. Harper, President James 
B. Angell, General John Eaton, Dr. William T. 
Harris, Minister of Education G. W. Ross of To- 
ronto, MM. G. Compayre' and Benjamin Buisson, 
Professor Stephan Watzoldt, Prince Wolkonsky, 
Professor Dimscha and M. Kovalevsky, Russian 
delegates, and a number of others. 

Two Congresses on the subject of Psychology 
were included in the proceedings of the second 
week. One of them, having for its special subject 
Experimental Psychology in Education, was organ- 
ized and presided over by President G. Stanley 
Hall, of Clark University, and held three sessions, 
devoting its entire time to the psychology of the 
child. The reasons for this limitation of field were 
thus set forth by Dr. Hall : " It has been decided, 
after much consideration and wide conference, to 
devote the entire three days to the subject of child 
study. Within a very few years several societies 
have been formed for this purpose ; several jour- 



nals have been started ; the school children in many 
cities of this country and Europe have been meas- 
ured or tested as to the rate of growth of body and 
muscular and mental power ; various classes of de- 
fect of sense, limb, mind, character, form of error 
in school work and of ignorance on entering school, 
have been tabulated. From these results a new 
body of literature is being developed, which throws 
much light upon the controllable causes, whether of 
excellence or defect, and contains many suggestions 
on the method and matter of teaching, and prom- 
ises to show how instruction can be made more ef- 
fective, as well as to point out the true beginnings 
of instruction, in the entire group of psychological 
subjects." Papers were presented by President Hail r 
Professors G. T. W. Patrick, Earl Barnes, W. L. 
Bryan, and others. Rational Psychology in Edu- 
cation was the subject of the other Congress of 
Psychologists, and was presided over by the vener- 
able Dr. James McCosh, whose active participation 
in the proceedings gave them a peculiar interest. 
Dr. McCosh read the opening paper at the first of 
the three sessions, taking for his subject, " Reality : 
What Place Has It in Philosophy ? " The second 
paper, sent by Professor Josiah Royce, discussed 
the dependence of psychology upon physiology. The 
reading of this paper was followed by an interest- 
ing discussion, in which Dr. McCosh and Professor 
Paul Shorey took leading parts. At the other ses- 
sions, papers were read by President Schurman, of 
Cornell University, Dr. A. F. Hewitt, of the Cath- 
olic University of America, Professor G. T. Or- 
mond, of Princeton, and Professor Titchener, of 
Cornell. 

The Congress on Higher Education held nine ses- 
sions during the two weeks ; the first six of which ses- 
sions were organized by a committee headed by Pres- 
ident Rogers, of the Northwestern University, and 
Mrs. H. C. Brainard of the University of Chicago. 
The first session of this Congress was opened, after 
the preliminary addresses of welcome, by President 
Angell, of the University of Michigan, who read a 
paper on " State Universities in the United States." 
Another paper of interest was by Miss E. P. Hughes, 
Principal of the Cambridge (England) Training 
College, on " The Training of University Graduates 
for the Profession of Teaching." The proceedings 
of the day following were devoted to education in 
Germany. A paper presented by Frl. Kathe Schir- 
macher, of Danzig, gave some " Reasons Why the 
German Universities Are the Last to Admit Wo- 
men "; Professor Dittman Finkler, of the Univer- 
sity of Bonn, read a paper on the general subject 
of " The German University "; and a paper sent 
by Professor Stephen Watzoldt, of the University 
of Berlin, had for its title " Schools and Universi- 
ties in Germany." On Saturday, July 22, the pro- 
gramme included the following speakers and pa- 
pers : " Latin and Greek as Elements of Second- 
ary and Higher Education Compared with Science 
and History," by Commissioner of Education Will- 
iam T. Harris ; " University Education for Women 



1893.] .

in Russia," by Prince Sergius Wolskonsky ; " Free- 
dom to Teach," by Mrs. M. F. Crow, of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago ; " Co-education : Its Advan- 
tages and Its Dangers," by Mrs. A. A. F. Johns- 
ton, of Oberlin University ; " The Balance of Stud- 
ies in the College Course," by Miss Sarah F. Whit- 
ing, of Wellesley College ; " The Distinction be- 
tween College and University Training," by Miss 
Mary A. Jordan, of Smith College ; and " The Re- 
lation of the Government of the United States to 
Higher Education," by the Hon. John W. Hoyt. 
The four papers first mentioned in this list were, 
perhaps, the most important, or at least aroused the 
most evident interest. On Monday, July 24, a 
number of papers of the highest importance were 
read. Those particularly deserving of mention are 
" The Latest Revival of the Study of Politics," by 
Professor Bernard Moses, of the University of Cal- 
ifornia ; " Graduate Work in America," by Pro- 
fessor William Gardner Hale, of the University of 
Chicago ; " University Education in France," by M. 
Gabriel Compayre, of the Academy of Poitiers ; 
" The Study of Literature in French Universities," 
by M. Andre* Chervillon, of the University of Lille ; 
" The New Movement in the Italian Universities," 
by Signora Zampini-Salazar, of Naples ; " The 
Value of a New University," by Professor Earl 
Barnes, of the Stanford University; and "The 
School at Athens," by Professor F. E. Woodruff, 
of Bowdoin College. The programme of this day's 
proceedings also included an address by Dr. Keane, 
Chancellor of the Catholic University of America. 
The discussion of Higher Education was con- 
tinued, under the auspices of the National Educa- 
tional Association, during three highly interesting 
sessions held on the mornings of July 26, 27, and 
28. Professor A. F. West, of Princeton Univer- 
sity, acted as secretary of these meetings, and the 
presiding officers were Presidents Gilman, Angell, 
and Patton. Discussions rather than set papers 
were the rule at these sessions. At the first session, 
the subjects up for consideration were these : How 
far is it desirable that universities should be of one 
type ? How should we cope with the problem of ex- 
cessive specialization in university study ? To what 
extent should an antecedent liberal education be 
required of students of law, medicine, and theology ? 
In what way may professional schools be most advan- 
tageously connected with universities and colleges ? 
The first of these discussions was opened by Presi- 
dent Kellogg, of the University of California, and 
the last by President Low, of Columbia College. A 
paper sent by Professor Allievo, of the University 
of Turin, opened the second, while the third, which 
proved the most interesting of all, was opened by 
Professor Woodrow Wilson, who made a strong 
plea for the "antecedent liberal education" in all 
cases. The session of the second day brought the 
interest of the Congress to its climax. The special 
question for discussion was the use to be made by 
colleges of the Arts degree whether it should 
continue to stand, as heretofore, for the distinct 



type of humanistic culture produced by the study 
of Greek and Latin, or whether it should be con- 
verted into an " omnibus " degree to be conferred 
upon graduates in all departments. Professor Hale 
opened this discussion with a carefully prepared 
and logical argument for the former contention, to 
which President Jordan, of the Stanford University, 
made an able but somewhat inconclusive reply. Pro- 
fessor Shorey, of the University of Chicago, then 
took the platform, and made a singularly effective 
plea for the retention of what has always been, un- 
til recently, the accepted meaning of the Arts de- 
gree. The trenchant way in which the speaker 
cleared the whole discussion of the irrelevancies 
that are always creeping into it and obscuring the 
real points at issue was particularly satisfying. 
Another argument for the " omnibus " degree, by 
Professor T. C. Chamberlain, of the University 
of Chicago, closed the discussion of this subject. 
Another subject coming up at the same session was 
that of the conditions of undergraduate life at the 
present day as compared with the conditions a gen- 
eration ago, the discussion to range, as the pro- 
gramme announced, "over the topics of athletics, 
morals, student organizations, intercollegiate cour- 
tesies, and relations of students to instructors." 
President Raymond, of Wesleyan University, led 
in this discussion, and took a very optimistic view 
of the situation. In the comment that followed, a 
sharp divergence of opinion was manifest, espe- 
cially as to the influence of college athletics. The 
Rev. Mr. Payne, of New York, was especially vig- 
orous in his denunciation of the evils attendant upon 
them, and his view of the matter, although extreme, 
had considerable support from other speakers. 

The closing session of this Congress had for its 
general theme " the relations of higher education 
to the advancement of culture, learning, and civil- 
ization." Professor West read a paper on " The 
Evolution of Liberal Education "; this was followed 
by a discussion of the doctorate in philosophy and 
of the conditions under which it should be bestowed, 
and the session closed with addresses by Bishop 
Keane and President Angell on the relation of our 
colleges to the advancement of civilization. When 
we consider the intelligent character of the audi- 
ences, the number of distinguished educators par- 
ticipating, and the excellence of the addresses made, 
we must reckon this Congress on the Higher Edu- 
cation as one of the most marked successes of the 
Auxiliary scheme. 

The University Extension Congress, in charge of 
a committee having as chairman Professor Na- 
thaniel Butler, Jr., of the University of Chicago, 
held five sessions, all included within the first week. 
The first paper read was one sent by Professor 
James Stuart, of London. It gave a sketch of Uni- 
versity Extension in England, and was particularly 
interesting as coming from the man who, in 1872, 
really started the movement. Of the other papers, 
those of especial interest and value were : "A Sketch 
of the Movement in America," by Miss Katharine

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



L. Sharp ; Dr. R. D. Roberts's paper on " Univer- 
sity Credits"; Mr. F. W. Shepardson's paper on 
" The Traveling Library "; Mr. E. T. Devine's pa- 
per on " The Syllabus "; Mr. George L. Hunter's 
paper upon " The Function of the Local Centre "; 
the addresses by Mrs. Charles Kendall Adams and 
Mr. Melvil Dewey. Mr. Charles Zeublin gave a 
very forcible and practical discussion of " Class 
Instruction as a Department of University Exten- 
sion," and Mr. E. L. S. Horsburgh, of Oxford, gave 
what was perhaps the strongest and most interest- 
ing paper of the entire programme, the paper which 
really closed the Congress, discussing " The Uni- 
versities and the Workingmen." The spirit in 
which he discussed it and the sentiment which he 
expressed were an interesting proof that the pro- 
gressive Englishman of to-day, even though he may 
come from Oxford itself, is quite as democratic as 
the educated and enlightened American. The 
chairman of the committee writes to us upon the 
work of the Congress as follows : " The recently 
closed Congress did not accomplish the very high- 
est ideals of success, but I think it came as near to 
that as any of the Congresses that have thus far 
been held. I feel that we could do much better if 
we had the thing to do a second time. There were 
many representatives of foreign countries in which 
the movement has begun in one form or another, 
who would have been glad to report the condition 
of work in their countries, but for that the time could 
not be found. I think we had rather too much read- 
ing of papers, with too little time for discussion. 
But, on the whole, the Congress was very gratify- 
ing, and I am sure that it put the movement of 
University Extension in a new light before a great 
many intelligent people who will carry back to their 
communities new ideas regarding this new instru- 
mentality of culture. I know of several commun- 
ities in neighboring States, in which undoubtedly 
the work will be begun the coming fall and winter 
merely because their representatives were present 
at our Congresses." 

Mr. Charles Zeublin, of the University of Chi- 
cago, and Miss Jane Addams, of Hull House, un- 
dertook the organization of a Congress on Social 
Settlements, and of this .Congress seven sessions 
were held during the first week. Among the pa- 
pers read we may mention : " The University Set- 
tlement Historically Considered," by Mr. Robert 
A. Woods, of Andover House, Boston ; " The Re- 
lation of the Settlement to Universities," by Mr. 
James B. Reynolds, of Paris ; " The Settlement as 
a Centre for University Extension," by Dr. R. D. 
Roberts, of London ; " The Settlement in Its Re- 
lation to Municipal Reform," by Mrs. Florence 
Kelley ; " The Settlement in Its Relation to Tene- 
ment Houses," by Miss Helena Dudley, of Phila- 
delphia ; " The Settlement in Its Relation to Or- 
ganized Social Work," by Mr. Everett P. Wheeler, 
of New York; "Weak Points in the Settlement 
Method," by Mr. Edward Cummings, of Harvard 



University ; " The Settlement in Its Relation to the 
Art Movement," by Miss Ellen G. Starr, of Hull 
House; and "The Ideals of Future Society as 
Evolved in a Settlement," by Mr. Charles Zeublin. 
The evening Symposium on " The Settlement in 
Its Relation to the Labor Movement," opened by 
Mr. Henry D. Lloyd, was perhaps the most inter- 
esting of the sessions of this Congress. 

The Congresses of Secondary and Elementary 
Education were held during the second week, and 
had three sessions each. In the former, the prin- 
cipal subjects of discussion related to the arrange- 
ment of the school curriculum, although the inaug- 
ural address, by Dr. J. C. Mackenzie, had for its 
subject the supervision of secondary instruction by 
State or municipal authority. In the latter Con- 
gress, the course of study occupied the first session, 
the teaching of geography the second, and moral 
education the third. The geography session, hav- 
ing the most specific theme, proved the most suc- 
cessful, and was provided with an interesting ap- 
pendix in the shape of an address by General A. 
W. Greeley, on the subject of " Arctic Explora- 
tions." 

The Congress on Technological Instruction held 
three sessions, and was opened by General Francis 
A. Walker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology. The first session considered the thesis : 
" How far do the technological schools, as they are 
at present organized, accomplish the training of 
men for the scientific professions, and how far and 
for what reasons do they fail to accomplish their pri- 
mary purpose ? " The other sessions discussed the 
educational value of a number of special technolog- 
ical studies, such as chemistry, electricity, and draw- 
ing. The Congress on Manual Education, which 
extended through the two weeks, had no less than 
eleven sessions, and the papers read were of a high 
character. Among them we may mention : " The 
Function of Drawing and Manual Training in Edu- 
cation," by Professor C. R. Richards, of the Pratt 
Institute, Brooklyn ; " Manual " Training in the 
American School System," by President Walter 
Hervey, of the New York Training College ; " The 
Ethical Value of Manual Training," by Dr. Emil 
G. Hirsch ; " Manual Training in Sweden," by Pro- 
fessor Gustaf Sellergren, of the Stockholm Techno- 
logical High School ; " The Influence of Japanese 
Art," by Professor Ernest Fenollosa, of the Boston 
Art Museum ; The Philosophy of the Tool," by 
Dr. Paul Cams ; " Manual and Art Education in 
Switzerland," by Mr. Edward Boos-Jegher, official 
delegate of the Swiss Confederation ; and the ad- 
dresses by Mr. W. M. R. French, Dr. H. H. Bel- 
field, chairman of the committee of organization, 
Dr. C. M. Woodward, of Washington University, 
Professor Gabriel Bamberger, the Rev. F. W. Gun- 
saulus, Professor Halsey S. Ives, Dr. W. T. Har- 
ris, and the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones. The papers 
and addresses above mentioned came during the 
first week ; the second was mainly devoted to the

discussion of certain theses, previously selected and 
announced, such as: ''The new demands which 
the world's industries make upon the elementary 
schools," "The claims of the two systems of man- 
ual training known as the Russian and the Swedish," 
and " Since all industrial products involve form, it 
follows that all industrial instruction should have 
an aesthetic basis in the study of the general prin- 
ciples which underlie all tasteful and graceful forms, 
and this study should be regarded and ranked as of 
equal educational value with the mechanic art pro- 
cesses." 

The limits of our space forbid any account of 
the proceedings of the Congress on Art Instruction, 
in three sessions ; the Congress on Instruction in 
Vocal Music, likewise in three sessions ; the Con- 
gress on Kindergarten Education, in thirteen ses- 
sions ; of the three joint sessions of the Kindergarten 
and Manual Training Congresses ; or of the Con- 
gresses on School Supervision and the Professional 
Training of Teachers, in three sessions each. And 
there are something like a dozen of the Education 
Congresses that we cannot even mention by name. 

" All are but parts of one stupendous whole." 
Of how stupendous was that whole our account may 
convey a certain, although a necessarily imperfect, 
idea. Perhaps the following sentences, quoted from 
an article by Mr. A. Tolman Smith, of the United 
States Bureau of Education, may serve us as well 
as anything for a closing comment: " On the hu- 
manity side this Congress is an assurance such as 
the world has never before received that the human 
family is one in the aspirations and the necessities 
of its spiritual being. On the professional side the 
Congress has sounded the note of a victory over the 
downfall and routing of two fetishes long wor- 
shipped in our schools : the fetish of uniform work 
at a uniform pace for all children, and the deadly 
superstition that teaching is a matter of fixed method 
which can be drilled into insensate minds." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

BREACH OF IDIOM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a foot-note to p. 85 of " Modern English," I call 
attention to a slip on the part of Mr. G. P. Marsh, 
where he writes: 

"The word respect, in this combination, has none of the 
meanings known to [sic] it, as an independent noun, in the 
English vocabulary." 

Mr. R. O. Williams, in your issue for July 1, con- 
tends that Mr. Marsh there delivers himself metonym- 
ically. But, if he so delivers himself, for what is " word " 
exchangeable ? Its exchangeableuess failing, " the mean- 
ings known to it," if acceptable, necessitates the accept- 
ance of " the known meanings to it " ; " to it " being for 
of it. 

Since, in correct usage, known to is practically equiv- 
alent to known by, the conversion of Mr. Marsh's pas- 
sive construction into the active yields: 



" The word respect, in this combination, has none of the 
meanings which it knows, as an independent noun, in the En- 
glish vocabulary." 

To say that a meaning " is known to " or " is known 
by " a word, instead of " is recognized as borne by " it, 
just like saying that a word " knows " a meaning, for 
" has " it, at best involves, it seems to me, a highly 
nebulous and intolerable sort of personification. 

We are by no means obliged, however, to conclude 
that Mr. Marsh ventured to sanction the novel phenom- 
enon of a word's " knowing " a meaning, whether as an 
intimate, as a casual acquaintance, or as tantum visum. 
The question of what he actually did, I shall come to a 
little farther on. 

In order to be fully intelligible, I repeat my foot- 
note above referred to: 

" A Lord Grenville of former days wrote of ' a long and de- 
structive warfare, of a nature long since unknown to the prac- 
tice of civilized nations.' Here, remarks Coleridge, ' the word 
to is absurdly used for the word in.' ( ' Essays on His Own 
Times,' p. 202.) Not unlike the nobleman's 'unknown to,' 
the context considered is Mr. Marsh's ' known to.' " 

Lord Grenville was far from intending to say, though 
in effect he says, that, as concerns a certain " long and de- 
structive warfare, the practice of civilized nations was, in 
the distant past, ignorant of its nature." For Coleridge, 
if he had altered more freely, must have proposed to sub- 
stitute, in place of " unknown to," " discarded in " ; Lord 
Grenville's nobiliary rhetoric, unamended, importing 
that the kind of warfare which he disapproves of was 
not known in remote ages. 

Altogether apart from this, to predicate, respecting a 
practice, that it does not " know " this or that, is, I ad- 
mit, a metonomy, in which " practice " stands for " those 
who practise." But a metonomy thus violent, permis- 
sible though it may be in poetry, is, to my mind, quite 
out of place in plain pedestrian prose. That, however, 
Lord Grenville indulged in it I see no reason for be- 
lieving. Coleridge condemned his " to " only for in; 
and " not unlike it, the context considered," as I have 
said, is the " to " which Mr. Marsh puts for of. All 
this becomes clear by rewriting, with inversions, the 
passages quoted. 

Mr. Marsh, in doing as he does, exemplifies the care- 
lessness in the employment of indeclinables which not- 
ably distinguishes our countrymen in general. Of this 
carelessness, a few illustrations, exhibiting to misused 
for a variety of prepositions, here follow: 

" The horse . . . had a very disdainful fling to his hind 
legs." (H. W. Longfellow, Eavanagh [ed. 1849], p. 107.) 

" A claim for extraordinary protection to a certain kind of 
property." (J. R. Lowell [1861], Political Essays [1888], 
p. 57.) 

"Cattle without any go to them." (Dr. O. W. Holmes, 
Elsie Venner [1861], ch. xxi.) 

" There was a chivalric smack to the title of the book." 
(Dr. J. G. Holland, The Heroes of Crampton [London ed. 
1867], p. 203.) 

" A few hundred pounds to the year were all that England 
gave the weary penman." (Mr. E. C. Stedman, Victorian 
Poets [London ed. 1876], p. 81.) 

"An old negro . . . rode his plough-horse to a most un- 
wonted speed." (Mr. E. Eggleston, Roxy [London ed. 1878], 
vol. ii., pp. 29,) 

" The light was so great as to be seen . . . far out to sea." 
" There is, probably, no short and precise solution to the dif- 
ficult problem." (Mr. Josiah Quincy, Figures of the Past 
[1884], pp. 38, 350. J 

" There was a hard, metallic glitter to his talk, as there is

[Aug. 16, 



to the dialogues in his plays." (Professor A. S. Hill, Our 
English [1889], p. 205.) 

" He set out at once to Boston, to investigate the subject." 
(Mr. John Bigelow, William Cullen Bryant [1890], p. 2. ) 

In all these quotations there is violation of idiom. 
To allege, against my position relative to their "to," 
such phrases as " there are three sides to a triangle," 
" Albany lies to the north of New York," " it serves as 
a protection to the throat," etc., etc., or quaintnesses like 
" we have Abraham to our father," " he was son to a 
butcher," is no argument. Good contemporary usage, 
not analogy, determines what is idiomatic; and accord- 
ingly, Mr. Williams's " a half-dozen of them," in his 
letter before me, and his " did not have," in " Our Dic- 
tionaries," p. 107, cannot be permitted to pass muster. 

" Has F. H.' ever erred ? " So inquires Mr. Wil- 
liams, humorously; and he shall have an answer to his 
inquiry from the very highest authority, an answer 
which he may, with all confidence, enroll among the 
placita prudentum. Alas ! much too favorable dear sir, 
often, and far oftener than often, in the course of his 
philological peregrinations, has that eminent oracle, for 
want of unction with the oil of inerrancy, gone wholly 
and disastrously astray, nay, come to utter and irrecov- 
erable grief, precisely after the fashion of the most or- 
dinary lost sheep of the commonest fold. But, for all 
that, it chances, curiously enough, that, in nearly all 
cases where he has been charged with taking the wrong 
road, he has had the good fortune to take the right one ; 
and this he may some day show in detail, at the same 
time making a full and contrite confession of his mani- 
fold and multifarious shortcomings. Resuming the first 
person, he would be allowed, meanwhile, to advert to 
one of his most recent miscarriages, in the matter of 
expression, and to explain how it came about. 

It was in the London " Academy," in a letter which, 
by the way, I have to thank THE DIAL for noticing gra- 
ciously, that I stumbled and fell. The beginning of 
that letter runs: "This question, it may be confidently 
assumed, is one to which all, barring the grossly illiter- 
ate, would reply in the affirmative. Most of them, too, 
if asked," etc. The proof-sheet had " Most of us" with 
" we," " our," and " we should," in what immediately 
follows, instead of "they," "their," and " they would." 
Revising, in unavoidable haste, I altered, in " Most of 
MS," only the " us," not observing that I had thereby as 
good as blundered into the tautological " Most of all," 
for " most." For the rest, on discovery of the remark- 
able genius who is not liable, when working against 
time, to such a mishap as that of mine, I should be glad 
to secure him, if possible, as my literarian Gamaliel.

Marlesford, England, July 15, 1893. 

P. S. " Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses 
it more than once." This sentence Mr. Williams quotes 
from me as " a remark " which I make " concerning 
another locution." Is my remark amiss as to its word- 
ing ? or in what it expresses ? I am at a loss to know. 



THE USE AND ABUSE OF SLANG. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The paper by Professor Brander Matthews, in a re- 
cent number of " Harper's Monthly Magazine," on " The 
Function of Slang," fills, as the advertisements say, a 
long-felt want. Every true philologist, in these latter 
days, must have wished for some one bold enough to 
dispute the old pedagogic theory that slang is invariably 
a linguistic crime. Professor Matthews's literary inde- 



pendence and alert modernity signally qualify him to 
set up the new standard; and yet his manifesto might, 
I conceive, have been considerably improved by the omis- 
sion of a few inaccuracies and a correction in point of 
view. 

He says, for instance, that the vulgar phrase " fire 
out," in the sense of expel forcibly, was used by Shake- 
speare, and quotes in support from one of the sonnets: 
" Till my good angel fire my bad one out." 

Here, obviously, the " fire out " means, not expel forcibly, 
as Professor Matthews, curiously enough, seems to have 
thought, but drive away by fire. In " Lear " we have 
the same figure: 

" He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven 
And fire us hence like foxes." (Lear, v, 3 ; 22,} 

The power and poetic propriety of this figure must be 
felt at once. In Shakespeare's use of the term, Adam 
and Eve may be said to have been " fired out " of Eden ; 
yet we should hardly like to say so of them nowadays, 
simply because the modern metaphor is that of fire- 
arms, not of a fire-brand. Of the two, I think no one 
will hesitate to pronounce Shakespeare's the better. He 
was not seldom extravagant in his tropes, but it re- 
mained for the exuberant incongruity of the nineteenth 
century to speak of " firing " people from the cannon's 
mouth. In circuses, to be sure, we have all seen lovely 
pink-apparelled creatures who were literally " fired out," 
who described graceful parabolas through the air, landed 
safely in capacious nets, and made unsteady exits with 
bows and kisses of the hand. But when we talk about 
" firing " a book agent from an office room, nine in ten 
of us have dulled our use of the words by forgetting 
what they originally meant. 

It is this same heedless lack of imagination that is 
the besetting sin of much of the popular diction of to- 
day, a sin which Professor Matthews fails to rebuke 
as I could wish a person of his authority to have done. 
He says, " It cannot be declared too often and too em- 
phatically how fortunate it is that the care of our lan- 
guage is not in the hands of even the most competent 
of our scholars." Our scholars and our purists exert a 
corrective influence which these rapid days make us 
hardly able to do without. In slower times a new word 
or a new phrase was not caught at once upon the cur- 
rent of popular approval; it was revolved first in the 
sober eddies of scholastic deliberation, with the result 
that much rubbish was got rid of by the way. We 
hardly agree with Professor Matthews that this rubbish 
should be swept along undammed. And we should be 
inclined to dispute him utterly, if by " the most compe- 
tent of our scholars " he included Lowell, Emerson, and 
men of their calibre. A language with the like of them 
for overseers would never be in danger of growing for- 
mal, and could not tend seriously toward the license which 
Professor Matthews rather too cursorily deprecates. 
He should recall Emerson's American Scholar for 
breadth and scholastic equity. And his admired Lowell 
might have kept him from such an error as implying 
that deck, in the sense of a pack of cards, is slang, 
" Western," Professor Matthews says, not, perhaps, hav- 
ing known always that it is an old word. If the men 
of books had a little more to say in this matter, they 
would not let good words come into disrepute because 
they fell into bad company, and there would be less 
necessity for the coinage of new ones.

GEOIIG EBERS'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 



The proverbial rarity of true " Confessions " 
is not so surprising when we consider how hard 
it is to shrive one's self, without evasion or 
casuistry, even at the bar of one's own con- 
science. Perfectly sincere autobiographies are 
the black swans of literature. Even Samuel 
Pepys, the accepted type of autobiographical 
candor, never meant to be candid. He care- 
fully screened himself from observation (as he 
thought) behind his cipher ; and posterity has 
taken what is, on the whole, rather an unfair 
advantage of him. Pepys was really a sensible, 
self-respecting man, and not unmindful of Lord 
Chesterfield's maxims as to the Graces ; and 
were it possible for him at any time to revisit 
the glimpses of the moon, his dismay at the qual- 
ity of his reception would be comical indeed. 

In the little volume before us, " The Story 
of My Life," by Dr. Georg Ebers the eminent 
Egyptologist and novelist, the point beyond 
which autobiographical frankness ceases, in a 
way, to be a virtue is fairly indicated. The 
book gives us all that its title warrants us in 
asking, and it does not give us too much. Its 
most important heads are the touching retro- 
spect of the author's childhood, the account of 
his gymnasium and university career and of his 
early essays in authorship, and the description 
of the unique Keilhau school (founded by Frce- 
bel), its methods and ideals. There is a good 
deal of incidental portraiture and reminiscence, 
and certain not unimportant Pendennis-like 
episodes of the narrator's Flegeljahre are amus- 
ingly told. The style throughout is easy and 
familiar, and there is a certain engaging air, 
especially in the earlier chapters, of musing, 
half-soliloquy, that the rather hasty translation 
has not altogether effaced. 

Georg Ebers was born in Berlin in 1837. 
He was a posthumous child. " It was," he says, 

" To soothe a mother's heartbreak that I came in the 
saddest hours of her life, and, though my locks are now 
gray, I have uot forgotten the joyful moments in which 
that dear mother hugged her fatherless little one, and 
among other pet names called him her ' comfort child.' " 

The mother was a Berliner only by adoption. 
She was a native of Holland ; and that the title 
of " the beautiful Hollander," by which she 
became known in the capital, was worthily be-

stowed is attested by the portrait which (in 
the fullest sense) adorns the volume before us. 
The plate is, in itself, a poor one ; but the 
beauty and goodness of the original shine 
through and fairly overcome the faults and in- 
adequacies of the representation. Says our 
author : 

" No one could help pronouncing my mother beauti- 
ful; but to me she was at once the fairest and best of 
women, and if I make the suffering Stephanus in Homo 
Sum say, < For every child his own mother is the best 
mother,' mine certainly was to me. My heart rejoiced 
when I perceived that every one shared this apprecia- 
tion." 

When the elder Ebers led the "beautiful 
Hollander " away from her native city as his 
bride, the burgomaster told him that he gave 
to his keeping the pearl of Rotterdam ; and 
that the phrase was not merely the language 
of compliment was evinced by the young wife's 
speedy social triumph in her new home. She 
became one of the most courted women in Ber- 
lin society : 

" Holtei (the actor and dramatist) had made her ac- 
quaintance at this time, and it was a delight to hear her 
speak of those gay, brilliant days. How often Baron 
von Humboldt, Rauch, or Schleiermacher had escorted 
her to dinner ! Hegel had kept a blackened coin won 
from her at whist. Whenever he sat down to play 
cards with her he liked to draw it out, and showing it 
to his partner, say, ' My thaler, fair lady.' " 

Holtei, in later years, when asked by the au- 
thor if he remembered the " fair lady," warmly 
replied : 

"... No, my young unknown friend, I have far too 
much with which to reproach myself, have brought from 
the conflicts of a changeful life a lacerated heart, but I 
have never reached the point where that heart ceased 
to cherish Fanny Ebers among the most sacred memo- 
ries of my chequered career. How often her loved 
image appears before me when, in lonely twilight hours, 
I recall the past." 

Less eloquent was the tribute of Frau Kom- 
missionsrath Reichert, to whom Madam Ebers, 
in the first year of her widowhood, applied for 
the lease of a house in the Thiergartenstrasse. 
This lady, having no children herself, inclined 
to be rather sharp with people who had ; so 
she refused the lease, adding that she pre- 
ferred to let the house " stand empty rather 
than rent it to a family with children." But, 
says the author, 

" She had a warm, kind heart, and she told me this 
ners elf the sight of the beautiful young mother in 
her deep mourning made her quickly forget her preju- 
dice. ' If she had brought ten bawlers instead of five,' 
she remarked, ' I would not have refused the house to 
that angel face.' " 

About this pleasant, retired house in the 
Thiergartenstrasse are twined some of the ten-

derest memories of the author's childhood 
among them the regular pilgrimages to the 
churchyard where his father lay buried. At 
these little ceremonies all the children were re- 
quired to assist : 

" During the walk, we gathered blue corn-flowers and 
scarlet poppies from the fields, bluebells, daisies, ranun- 
culus, and snap-dragon from the turf along the road- 
side, and tied them into nosegays for the graves. My 
mother moved silently with us between the rows of grassy 
mounds, tombstones, and crosses, while we carried the 
pots of flowers and wreaths, which, to afford everyone 
the pleasure of helping, she had distributed among us 
at the grave-digger's house, just back of the cemetery. 
. . . My mother led the way into the small enclosure, 
which was surrounded by an iron railing, and prayed or 
thought silently of the beloved dead who rested there. 
. . . When she had satisfied the needs of her own soul, 
she turned to us, and with cheerful composure directed 
the decoration of the mound. Then she spoke of our 
father, and if any of us had recently incurred punish- 
ment one instance of this kind is indelibly impressed 
on my memory she passed her arms around the child, 
and in whispered words, which no one else could hear, 
entreated the son or daughter not to grieve her so again, 
but to remember the dead." 

Later, the family moved to the Lennestrasse, 
and at this period our author's acquaintance 
with the world of books and of men fairly be- 
gan. The mother was still the sun about which 
the little lives revolved. She shared in and 
supervised the amusements of her children, and 
directed their reading with judicious liberality. 
Robinson Crusoe, the Arabian Nights, Don 
Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, etc., were devoured 
in turn ; but the ever-green story of the Trojan 
War was the common favorite: 

" Homer's heroes seemed like giant oaks, which far 
overtopped the little trees of the human wood. They 
towered like glorious snow-mountains above the little 
hills with which my childish imagination was already 
filled; and how often we played the Trojan War, and 
aspired to the honor of acting Achilles, Hector, or Ajax." 

In the Lennestrasse our author was early 
introduced to the world of art, and enjoyed 
access to the neighboring studios of Drake, 
Streichenberg, and Peter Cornelius. Corne- 
lius was an especial friend ; and when he asked 
permission of Madam Ebers to use her son's 
blond curly head as a model, the mother readily 
consented. Of this memorable sitting the wri- 
ter, as he says, remembers nothing save some 
particularly good candied fruit which the artist 
found necessary to administer at intervals : 

" Even now I smile at the recollection of his making 
an angel or a spirit of peace out of the wild boy who 
perhaps just before had been scuffling with the enemy 
from the flower-cellar." 

An equally notable friend at that time was 
Court-Chaplain Strauss : 



" When Strauss met us in the street and called to us 
with a certain unction in his melodious voice, < Good 
morning my dear children in Christ ! ' our hearts went 
out to him, and it seemed to us as if we had received a 
blessing." 

Strauss was deep in the counsels of Freder- 
ick William IV., although that eccentric 
prince could not resist an inclination to make 
cheap jokes at the good man's expense. After 
creating him court-chaplain, Frederick said to 
Alexander von Humboldt : "A trick in nat- 
ural history which you cannot copy ! I have 
turned an ostrich (Strauss) into a bull-finch 
(Dompfaffer} " an allusion to Strauss's be- 
ing a preacher in the cathedral (Dow). 

It was to this jocular prince that von Hum- 
boldt, when asked how he, who passed at court 
for a freethinker, could go to church, made the 
apt reply, " In order to get on, your Excel- 
lency." 

The scenes of the Berlin revolution natur- 
ally left a deep impression on the writer's 
mind, and the two chapters devoted to the pe- 
riod are full of graphic interest. The family 
were then living in the Linkstrasse, not far 
from the scene of the disturbances. The catch- 
words of the day were in the mouths even of 
the schoolboys ; and the author remembers es- 
pecially a truculent phrase, " hanging the last 
king with the guts of the last priest," which he 
heard for the first time from the lips of a big, 
blond-bearded man at the sculptor Streichen- 
berg's, a declaimer who talked much of the 
freedom of the people and of his own mission 
to pave the way for it, and who was probably 
comfortably out of danger when the fighting 
began. The ever-recurring catch-word Press- 
freiheit (freedom of the press) was altered by 
the wags of the school into Fressfreiheit (lib- 
erty to stun one's self) ; and cries of " Loyal 
Legioner," " Pietist," " Friend of Light," etc., 
were not wanting. When the tumult began 
in the Schlossplatz, and the ominous rattle of 
musketry was heard from the Leipzigerstrasse, 
there was a sudden rush of an excited throng of 
rioters down the quiet street where the Ebers 
lived : 

"The tall, bearded fellow at their head we knew 
well. It was the upholsterer Specht, who had often 
put up curtains and done similar work for us, a good 
and capable workman. But what a change ! Instead 
of a neat little hammer, he was flourishing an axe, and 
he and his companions looked as if they were going to 
avenge some terrible injury. He caught sight of us, 
and I remember distinctly the whites of his rolling eyes 
as he raised his axe higher, and shouted hoarsely, and 
as if the threat was meant for us: ' They shall get it ! ' 
Meanwhile the fighting in the streets seemed to have 
increased in places to a battle, for the crash of the ar- 



1893.]

tillery grapeshot was constantly intermingled with the 
crackling of the infantry fire, and through it all the 
bells were sounding the tocsin, a wailing, warning sound, 
which stirred the inmost heart." 

Happily, with the night the brief reign of 
terror was over. It was said that all was quiet ; 
the famous proclamation " To my dear people 
of Berlin " was issued ; but Pressfreiheit (and 
indeed " Fressfreiheit ") were still below the 
horizon, while luckless " upholsterer Specht " 
lay quiet enough in the cool of the morning, 
with outstretched hands that were done with 
the axe and the " neat little hammer " forever. 
The Berlin streets on that day presented a 
strange and terrible medley : 

" Here was a pool of blood, there a bearded corpse ; 
here a blood-stained weapon, there another blackened 
with powder. Like a cauldron where a witch mixes all 
sorts of strange things for a philtre, each barricade con- 
sisted of every sort of rubbish, together with objects 
originally useful. All kinds of overturned vehicles, 
from an omnibus to a perambulator, from a carriage to 
a hand-cart, were everywhere to be found. Ward- 
robes, commodes, chairs, boards, bookshelves, bath-tubs 
and wash-tubs, iron and wooden pipes, were piled to- 
gether, and the interstices filled with sacks of straw 
and rags, mattresses, and carriage cushions. . . . Bloody 
and terrible pictures rose before us, and perhaps there 
was no need of Assessor Geppert's calling to us sternly, 
' Off home with you, boys ! ' to turn our feet in that 
direction." 

Touching the mooted question whether the 
Berlin revolution was the result of a long-pre- 
pared conspiracy or the spontaneous outburst 
of enthusiasm for liberty among the citizens, 
Dr. Ebers adopts the opinion of von Sybel : 

" Both these views are equally well founded, for only 
the united effort of the two forces could insure a pos- 
sibility of victory." 

From the detailed account of the admirable 
Keilhau school we shall extract only the fol- 
lowing notice of Frosbel, its founder : 

" When we came to Keilhau he was already sixty-six 
years old, a man of lofty stature, with a face which 
seemed to be carved with a dull knife out of brown 
wood. His long nose, strong chin, and large ears, be- 
hind which the long locks, parted in the middle, were 
smoothly brushed, would have rendered him positively 
ugly, had not his ' Come, let us live for our children,' 
beamed so invitingly in his clear eyes. . . . Yet I 
must confess and his portrait agrees with my memory 
that his face by no means suggested the idealist and 
man of feeling; it seemed rather expressive of shrewd- 
ness, and to have been lined and worn by severe con- 
flicts concerning the most diverse interests. But his 
voice and his glance were unusually winning, and his 
power over the child was limitless. A few words were 
sufficient to win completely the shyest boy whom he de- 
sired to attract; and thus it happened that, even when 
he had been with us only a few weeks, he was never 
seen crossing the court-yard without a group of the 
younger pupils hanging to his coat-tails and clasping 
his hands and arms. . . . We never called him any- 



thing but Oheim ' (uncle). The word ' Onkel ' he de- 
tested as foreign, because it was derived from ' avun- 
culus ' and ' oncle.' " 

If the reader will call to mind for a mo- 
ment, in connection with this winning picture, 
some " Dr. Busby " of his own boyhood, and 
the probable result of a pupil's calling the 
great man " uncle " not to speak of " hanging 
to his coat-tails," the principle that lay at 
the root of Frrebel's ideals becomes apparent. 
Love for the master, and the freest opportu- 
nity for the development of individual char- 
acter, was the rule at the Keilhau school. 
" Wherever I have met," says our author, 

" An old pupil of Keilhau, I have found in him the 
same love for the institute, have seen his eyes sparkle 
more brightly when we talked of Langethal, Midden- 
dorf, and Barop (the masters). Not one has turned out 
a sneak or a hypocrite." 

After a term at the gymnasia of Kottbus and 
Quedlinburg, Dr. Ebers entered Gottingen, 
where he resolved to devote himself to the law ; 
but his studies at this point were cut short by 
a terrible attack of spinal disease, which for 
some years left him almost helpless. It was 
during convalescence, however, that he found 
a final province of labor, a fixed goal toward 
which to move with firm tread in the seclusion 
to which his malady condemned him. He had 
been early attracted to Egyptology ; and by 
the advice of Jacob Grimm he resolved to take 
counsel with Richard Lepsius as to a plan of 
exhaustive study in that science. Lepsius's re- 
quirements were sufficiently formidable : 

" He had inquired about my previous education, and 
urged me to study philology, archaeology, and at least 
one Semitic language. ... It would be necessary 
also for me to understand English and Italian, since 
many things which the Egyptologist ought to know 
were published in those languages. Lastly he advised 
me to obtain some insight into Sanscrit, which was the 
point of departure for all linguistic studies." 

Lepsius, in brief, impressed upon the au- 
thor the truth, which he himself afterwards 
impressed upon his pupils, that it would be a 
mistake to begin by studying so restricted a 
science as Egyptology. The foundations nec- 
essary for the special structure must first be 
firmly laid. The programme suggested by 
Lepsius was thoroughly carried out, and many 
details were added including the study of 
Italian, Spanish, and Dutch. The material 
having been thus laboriously gathered, the ques- 
tion presented itself, how to turn it to account : 

This material gave me no peace. I soon mastered 
it completely, but gradually the relation changed and 
it mastered me, gave me no rest, and forced me to try 
upon it the poetic power so long condemned to rest."

In short, Dr. Ebers resolved, not without 
some twinges of his scientific conscience, to 
compose a novel embodying this troublesome 
material, and the outcome was " The Egyptian 
Princess " a title suggested by Auerbach. 
His account of the reception by the austere 
Lepsius of the finished manuscript is amus- 
ing: 

" I had not said even a word in allusion to what I 
was doing in the evening hours, and the three volumes

did more. He read it through to the last letter, and 
when, a fortnight later, he asked me at his house to re-

from what he had expected. The book was a scholarly

MR. IRVING'S VIEWS ON THE MODERN 
DRAMA.* 



Whatever the place to which definitive criti- 
cism may assign the fame of Mr. Henry Irving 
as an actor, there is no possibility that his ser- 
vice to the stage, as artist, producer, champion, 
will be overpraised. He deserves of his profes- 
sional brethren more than the pretense of grat- 
itude, and the intellectual world is under obli- 
gation to him not merely for additions to its 
refinement but for positive increase of its knowl- 
edge. It is not necessary to assume that be- 
fore Mr. Irving's time there was no actor es- 
teemed and no art of acting appreciable, for 
in his excellent little volume of Addresses on 
the Drama in which jewels of literature 
sort with gems of reason our lecturer is at 
loving pains to tell us what noble figures in his 
regard are four of the masters of other days, 
Burbage, Betterton, Garrick, Kean. But Mr. 
Irving chanced upon, though he partly brought 
about, an era of dramatic renaissance, to which 
Edwin Booth and Lawrence Barrett in our 
own country, Salvini and Rossi in Italy, Son- 
nenthal and Barnay in Germany, were equally 
coincident and contributory. It was the first 
period in the history of the theatre that found

Art of Acting. New York : Tait, Sons & Co. 



actors ready and capable to assert themselves 
as peers in the kingdom of Genius, entitled to 
move by authority and not by sufferance ; and 
they claimed the right to be received as equals 
and factors, not as proteges and exhibits, of the 
society that tardily opened to them its doors. 

Circumstances have peculiarly favored Mr. 
Irving, and he has had the shrewdness to de- 
rive their full benefit. He came in the de- 
ciduous season of the English stage. The 
great ones were fallen or falling, and there 
was so little promise in the rising actors that 
the chief honors were to be worn by him who 
should most urgently set himself to possess 
them. Though he has something of the poetic 
temperament and much of artistic culture, Mr. 
Irving is firmly practical, methodic, and calcu- 
lating. Ardent impulses never mislead him ; 
calm, discriminating judgment guides him. As 
a young man he saw the opportunities open- 
ing to someone in the uncertain conditions of 
the English theatre, and he determined to be 
that someone. He strove with a strenuousness 
it is not in the power of fate to resist. He began 
by educating himself, with an eye to mastery ; 
and, assiduous then, he has been unremitting 
since. Truly and thoroughly proud of his vo- 
cation, nothing would content him but that it 
should be so much a pride to others as to give 
its chief representatives absolute equality with 
the eminent followers of other arts and profes- 
sions. So it came about that to-day we have, elo- 
quently worded and of manly spirit, preserved 
in the covers of a book, lectures delivered by 
an actor as the nobly honored guest of that 
stern and august mistress of learning, the Phil- 
osophical Institution of Edinburgh ; of that an- 
cient contemner of the mummer vagabond, the 
University of Oxford ; and of Harvard, ven- 
erable in age but never intolerant. That Mr. 
Irving should a little exult in his triumph and 
in the greater triumph of the stage, was a thing 
expected and pardonable ; but the objection may 
be urged against him that he has been so can- 
did in the expression of his satisfaction as rather 
to give the impression of a favor received than 
of a right secured. However, it must be ad- 
mitted that for a grievous time in the world's 
history the actor class was, partly through its 
own ignoble obsequiousness, but mostly by force 
of community prejudices and ignorance, made 
unworthy social esteem ; and if the old trend 
of thought bore off the current of new ideas 
long after the stage had indicated its right to 
the regard of the wise and the good, there is 
abundant reason now for gratulation that a

better understanding between theatre and pub- 
lic has been educated. 

Question is made nowadays if the actor's be 
not the most difficult, as it is the most com- 
plex, of all the arts ; and it is pretty well 
established as a judgment that to be great as 
an actor entitles the man to a station not less 
than, nor removed from, that to which fame 
conducts poet, or painter, or sculptor, or states- 
man, or preacher. " A theatre," one time said 
Macready, " ought to be a place of recreation 
for the sober-minded and intelligent." So, 
indeed, the true theatre is ; for the theatre is 
not the building from whose plan of construc- 
tion it takes its name, but the vital drama, 
plays of life and character and thought and 
condition -and purpose. The great pity is that 
the drama proper is confounded with amuse- 
ments, that the theatre is made to take in 
everything in which there are the arc of a cir- 
cle and a stage. In any serious discussion of 
the drama, it is always presumed that the refer- 
ence is to its representative parts, those things 
in it that are best, noblest, enduring. Mr. 
Irving says, as soundly as felicitously : 

" The truth is that the immortal part of the stage is 
its noble part. Ignoble accidents and interludes come 
and go, but this lasts on forever. It lives like the hu- 
man soul in the body of humanity, associated with much 
that is inferior, and hampered by many hindrances, 
but it never sinks into nothingness, and never fails to 
find new and noble work in exactness of permanent and 
memorable excellence. Heaven forbid that I should 
seem to cover, even with a counterpane of courtesy, ex- 
hibitions of deliberate immorality. Happily this sort of 
thing is not common, and although it has hardly been 
practised by anyone who, without a strain of meaning, 
can be associated with the profession of acting; yet public 
<;ensure, not active enough to repress the evil, is ever 
ready to pass a sweeping condemnation on the stage 
which harbors it. Our cause is a good one. We go 
forth, armed with the luminous panoply which genius 
has forged for us, to do battle with dulness, with 
coarseness, with apathy, with every form of vice and 
vil. In every human heart there gleams a higher re- 
flection of this shining armor. The stage has no lights 
or shadows that are not lights of life and shadows of 
the heart. To each human consciousness it appeals in 
alternating mirth and sadness, and will not be denied. 
Err it must, for it is human ; but, being human, it must 
endure." 

Admission is made of the fact that the in- 
terests of the theatre are sometimes degraded 
by panders to low, vicious, and morbid tastes ; 
but fair-minded, intelligent people find no dif- 
ficulty in discriminating the devotees of the 
drama from the hucksters and tradespeople of 
the play-house, nor do they confound the pur- 
suit of a noble art with the practices of a con- 
temptible commerce between ignorance and 



vulgarity. But even in such cases there is this 
to be observed, that the stage " holds out long 
against the invitation to pander ; and such invi- 
tations, from the publicity and decorum that 
attend the whole matter, are neither frequent 
nor eager. A sort of decency sets in upon the 
coarsest person in entering even the roughest 
theatre. I have sometimes thought that, con- 
sidering the liability to descend and the facil- 
ity of descent, a special providence watches 
over the morals and tone of our English stage." 
He might have said, of the English-speaking 
stage ; for certainly nothing is more indicative 
of a protecting spirit of the drama than the 
high moral tone of the stage of this country, 
where the only censorship of the drama, and 
the only restraint upon the theatre, is public 
opinion. 

May we not see in the survival and triumph 
of the drama through ages of assault and con- 
tumely, of persecutions and prohibitions, a di- 
vine purpose somewhat wiser than the will of 
man ? Mr. Irving has suggested the reason why 
"the stage has literally lived down the rebuke 
and reproach under which it formerly cowered, 
while its professors have been simultaneously 
living down the prejudices which excluded them 
from society." That reason is, "The stage is now 
seen to be an elevating instead of a lowering 
influence on national morality, and actors and 
actresses receive in society, as do members of 
other professions, exactly the treatment which 
is earned by their professional conduct." The 
conditions were very different when each of 
the four great actors discussed in one of these 
lectures strove for the laurel. Their obligation 
in the service of their profession was that of 
pioneers. They commanded the emotions of 
men, and prepared the way for the persuasion 
of their intelligence. 

Thomas Sheridan, in 1746, in Dublin, pre- 
cipitated a notorious riot by declaring in the 
face of a rich young ruffian, who, with others 
had made a disorder in the theatre, " I am as 
good a gentleman as you are." This impu- 
dence on the part of an actor though he was 
the son of old Dr. Sheridan, scholar and gen- 
tleman, and a graduate of the university was 
"tolerable and not to be endured," and for 
some hours the audacious Thespian was in mor- 
tal danger. At the same time Garrick was 
trying to be a gentleman in London, and, if 
not wholly successful in having himself ac- 
cepted by the noble lords who patronized and 
condescended to him, he did beat down some 
of the barriers and cleared a way for others to

prosper in. The actor need not now eat out his 
heart with chagrin that his patient merit has 
to suffer whips and scorns on his profession's 
account. Society not only welcomes him, but 
holds him much in favor, for in these times 
the famous player has the advantage that at- 
tends preferment after revolution. He occu- 
pies a place in which he yet feels new, and of 
which he speaks mysteriously, and in which he 
is regarded with some curiosity. Even Mr. 
Irving could not repress a sort of chuckle from 
his lecture before the Philosophical Institution 
of Edinburgh. Before long all this reserve 
and strangeness will have disappeared, and the 
apologist of the theatre will be as rare a bird 
as the theatrical " reformer," described as one 
who combines with intellectual superciliousness 
a timidity as to moral contamination. Mr. Irv- 
ing finds the stage as it is both elevating and 
educating, a social benefactor and benefit to the 
individual, notwithstanding its sins of omission 
and of commission ; and I think no sociologist 
is prepared to dispute him. Indeed, the old 
warfare against the stage is about ended, or, if 
pursued, is so to the disadvantage of those who 
wage it ; of course I mean indiscriminate war- 
fare, battle against the theatre. 

Not less important than the first, but more 
technical and of immediate interest to the lim- 
ited number, is Mr. Irving's lecture on the Art 
of Acting. He finds as remarkable improve- 
ment in that regard as in the moral and social 
status of the theatre ; and particularly com- 
mends the modern adoption of Hamlet's ad- 
vice to the players as the rule and guide of 
action. Artifice is more and more dispelled, 
and the decrees of art become the utterance of 
nature. We learned sometime ago from his 
friendly rejoinders to Coquelin that Mr. Irving 
has no sympathy with the brilliant and specious 
Diderot's idea that the actor must be insensible 
to the emotions he simulates. It seems impos- 
sible there should be any great acting with- 
out profound sensibility, though it is the busi- 
ness of the artist to control his feelings within 
conscious bounds ; careful not to overstep the 
modesty of nature by letting passion get the 
better of judgment. Not to follow too far the 
interesting lead of Mr. Irving's delightful vol- 
ume and valuable addition to stage literature, 
this quotation, which presents a summary of 
the actor's art, will serve also as an epitome 
of the three especially aesthetic lectures : 

"It is necessary to this art that the mind should 
have, as it were, a double consciousness, in which all 
the emotions proper to the occasion may have full 



swing, while the actor is all the time on the alert for 
every detail of his method. It may be that his playing 
will be more spirited one night than another. But the 
actor who combines the electric force of a strong per- 
sonality with a mastery of the resources of his art must 
have a greater power over his audiences than the pas- 
sionless actor who gives a most artistic simulation of 
the emotions he never experiences."

RECENT FICTIOX.* 

For a good story, that pretends to be nothing 
more than a story, that impels to no soul-search- 
ings, and that is instructive only in the mildest way, 
the season has brought us nothing better than " The 
Refugees." Dr. Doyle's work usuallyhas a way of 
suggesting some one of the masters of fiction with 
" Micah Clarke " and " The White Company " the 
suggestion was of Scott, while with the Sherlock 
Holmes series it was only of Gaboriau, and the 
Franco- American romance now before us tempts to 
characterization of its writer as a Dumas double de 
Cooper. Taking the revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes as his central episode, Dr. Doyle seeks (not 
in vain) to interest us in the fortunes of a Hugue- 
not family group ; and his story divides neatly into 
two parts, one of which, quite as good as " Le Vi- 
comte de Bragelonne," takes us to the court of " le 
Roi Soleil," while the other, no less thrilling than 
" The Last of the Mohicans," transports us to the 
wilds of the New World, and gives us some of the 
best Indian fighting to be found in books. Adven- 
ture is piled upon adventure with startling swiftness 
of succession ; but we soon learn that the author has 
a way for his hero out of the difficulties he encoun- 
ters, however desperate, and we can only feign 
alarm at the critical moments. We must say that 
the writer's Americans (not Indians) are a little

overdone, and that some among the humorous points 
that he scores are the result of rather cheap devices, 
but the tale as a whole is so well-knit, so spirited, 
and so exciting in its interest, that criticism of the 
minuter sort stands abashed in its presence. 

Mr. Crawford's " Pietro Ghisleri " introduces us 
once more to the aristocratic Roman society made 
so familiar by the novels of the " Saracinesca " se- 
ries, and even, incidentally, to many of the charac- 
ters of those brilliant works of fiction. The new 
story is of surprising interest, and leaves little to 
be desired, either in constructive skill or in deline- 
ation of character. The plot is complicated and the 
structure compact; there is little of the padding 
that disfigures a number of the author's books, and 
often makes us feel that he was hard-pressed to fill 
the requisite number of pages. Many of Mr. Craw- 
ford's literary excursions have been unfortunate, 
noticeably his dreary novel of hypnotism and his 
formless Oriental fantasies ; and we are glad that 
he has returned to the solid and familiar ground of 
contemporary life in the country best known to him. 
Mr. Crawford has recently deprecated putting the 
novelist's art at the service of science ; but we are 
bound to express the opinion that, as social or his- 
torical documents, the series of his Roman stories 
have claims quite as strong as those based merely 
upon their power to amuse or to entertain. 

" From Out of the Past " is one of the best nov- 
els that we have lately had occasion to read, and 
yet, so unobtrusive is its excellence, so far removed 
from the sensational its manner, it is likely to cause 
hardly a ripple upon the stream of current fiction. 
The scene is Touraine, although the characters are 
American, and something of the peace and old-world 
charm of the place has found its way into the au- 
thor's pages. A deep and exquisite feeling for 
beauty in landscape and art has given the simple 
love-story of the book a setting that enhances its 
meaning at every point. The writer knows her 
Touraine minutely and lovingly; and as far as 
her book deals with French life it gives us the 
sane true life of the provinces, not the false and 
feverish life of the capital which so many take to 
be the typical life of France. Our chief adverse 
criticism upon the book must be for its occasional 
lapses into the style of the tourist manual ; the au- 
thor seems to know Touraine almost too well for 
strictly artistic purposes. The story of the book is 
skilfully told, although the reader is left until the 
very end in a not wholly justifiable state of suspense 
as to the outcome. We cordially commend the work 
to those in search of summer-afternoon literature. 

A strong character gives a name to a strong book 
in Miss Elliott's " John Paget." He is one of two 
brothers whom fate separates when children, one of 
them to become a worldling, the other he of the 
title to become, through devious ways, both a 
preacher and a minister of the Gospel. His nature 
has the stamp of sincerity, and earnestness of pur- 
pose characterizes his every act. His religion, how- 



ever subject to intellectual limitations, is of the true 
sort, for it supplements faith by undoubted works, 
and so commands our respect. As a protest against 
worldliness, as an almost passionate plea for the real- 
ities as distinguished from the shows of existence, 
" John Paget " is a book of fine ethical tone and 
worthy idealism. Yet it inculcates one lesson that 
is, in our opinion, distinctly false in its ethical bear- 
ings. The brothers have a cousin, Beatrice, who, 
after a youth of religious training in a Southern 
convent, is taken to the home of her relatives in 
New York, and there becomes devotedly attached 
to Claude, the brother of the worldly mind and train- 
ing, who returns her love in at least equal measure. 
Now these two natures are in every essential respect 
fitted for one another ; yet the shadow of dogma 
falls between them, and Beatrice, acting from what 
she supposes to be religious conviction, tears her 
love from her heart, and dies as the consequence. 
The author's sympathies are clearly with her hero- 
ine in this course ; that is, we are clearly given to 
understand that she believes it right that two lives 
should be wrecked by a barren intellectual abstrac- 
tion. Such tragedies occur in real life, no doubt, 
and perhaps we cannot greatly blame those who are 
directly responsible for them ; but no condemnation 
of the system that trains young girls to act as Bea- 
trice does can be too strong. Miss Elliott gives tacit 
assent to the system, and so her book seems to us 
to embody a profoundly immoral lesson. To the 
author, and to her heroine, certain passages (espe- 
cially in the preface) of Mr. Ruskin's " Sesame 
and Lilies " might be recommended as profitable 
reading. It is a pity that so good and thoughtful 
a book as " John Paget " should have been marred 
by this insistence upon matters of " mint and anise 
and cummin," even if " the weightier matters of the 
law " be not wholly neglected. 

A mining engineer from New England, search- 
ing for gold on a Virginia plantation, incidentally 
falling in love with a fair maiden of the South, and 
coming to a tragic end in the old graveyard to which, 
without reckoning upon native prejudice and super- 
stition, he had extended his diggings this is the 
story told in " Broadoaks " by Miss McClelland. 
The first thing that occurs to the reader is the use 
made by Miss Murfree of a similar situation, al- 
though the resemblance is not carried into detail. 
The story is well thought out, has the atmosphere of 
its locality, and offers, in its negro-character sketches, 
a certain element of semi-humorous diversion. 

" The Love Affairs of an Old Maid " are really 
the love affairs of a number of her friends, reflected 
in the sympathetic and generous consciousness of 
the narrator. In these pages, unaffected and ex- 
quisite in style, sparkling with humor, yet softened 
by a pathos that reaches the very depths of the 
spiritual life, are sketched the heart-stories of a doz- 
en men and women, each with a few swift incisive 
strokes, and, for the most part, an insight that 
makes of the book a gallery of distinctly individual

outline portraits. We imply no censure in saying 
that it is a woman's book, in noting the obvious 
fact that the men, with one exception, appear in but 
shadowy characterization. In the subtlety of her 
analysis, the writer reminds us not a little of Mrs. 
Clifford, while in her successful use of the epigram 
she suggests the brilliant Englishwoman who chooses 
to sign her very feminine books with the assertively 
masculine name of " John Oliver Hobbes/' Miss 
Bell is, we understand, a new-comer in the field of 
letters. It may safely be said that she has already 
won her spurs, and that her present performance 
justifies a lively expectation of excellent things to 
come. We hope that a rather forbidding title will 
not deter possible readers from making speedy ac- 
quaintance with a book possessing so distinct a 
charm. 

In " Old Kaskaskia " Mrs. Catherwood has given 
us another of her delicate outline pictures of life in 
the Old Northwest. The story is placed in the 
early days of the present century, and in the town 
that was soon to become the first capital of a great 
commonwealth. It has for its culminating episode 
a great rising of the Mississippi in which half Kas- 
kaskia was submerged, and which extricates the 
tangled threads of romance woven by the author's 
art, breaking some of them off, and uniting those 
that remain into more symmetrical patterns. The 
contrasted French and English types of character 
are delineated with a subtle feeling for their essen- 
tial differences, while Mrs. Catherwood's restrained 
and exquisite style gives literary charm to every 
page of her work. One cannot help wishing that 
the author would, for once, work upon a larger 
canvas than any she has yet sought to cover. The 
field she has chosen is almost her own, and its ro- 
mantic possibilities are considerable. 

" Toppleton's Client " is an extravaganza that 
ranges all the way from dry Stocktonian humor to 
roaring farce. The central idea is that of the ex- 
change of souls between bodies, and we may easily 
imagine the opportunities it offers a writer intent 
only upon the possible humorous complications. The 
" client " is an exiled spirit whose body is occupied by 
a usurping fiend, and who engages Toppleton (a law- 
yer whose chief work of reference is the " Comic 
Blackstone ") to possess him once more of the bod- 
ily estate that he has lost. But the fiend is too sharp 
for the lawyer, and, preferring Toppleton's cor- 
poreal tenement to that in which he has been fraud- 
ulently dwelling, effects a substitution, and leaves 
Toppleton helpless, either to protect the rights of 
his client or to re-establish his own. The extrava- 
ganza is overdone, here and there, and its theory 
will not bear close scrutiny, but it is, as a whole, 
entertaining. 

Of Mr. Kipling's " Many Inventions," many turn 
out to be variations upon the old familiar ones, and 
one gets a little tired even of Mulvaney and Or- 
theris and all the rest of the tribe of Atkins. But the 
volume contains one piece (which no one can for- 



get who read it in the English review where it first 
appeared) which we are inclined to rank as the 
cleverest thing and perhaps the most finely imag- 
inative that the author has ever done in prose. 
It is that romance of metempsychosis that he has 
chosen to style " The Finest Story in the World." 
The quotation-marks of this title are Mr. Kipling's, 
not ours, but we should be almost content to drop 
them, letting the name stand as a description of the 
author's own work, not of the work of his imagin- 
ary hero. It was a true stroke of genius to re- 
incarnate, in a cockney banker's clerk, one of the 
men who sailed with Thorfin Karlsefne, and to be- 
stow upon him reminiscent flashes of his past lives. 
The other stories in the book are of unequal value ; 
one can hardly escape being fascinated by Mul- 
vaney's adventure with " My Lord the Elephant," 
or finding in " A Conference of the Powers" a les- 
son at least worth the pondering. Mr. Kipling 
both introduces and closes his new collection of 
tales by some spirited verses. 

Mr. Brander Matthews has long before this shown 
himself an adept in the art of the short story, and 
his new volume is, as a matter of course, vivacious 
and entertaining. The characters that he knows 
best are those supplied by his own New York en- 
vironment of club and society life, although he 
reaches out, not without success, on one occasion to 
the wilds of British Guiana, and, on another, back 
to Augustan Rome. There are five stories alto- 
gether, two of which are distinctly romantic, one 
mildly satirical, one essentially humorous, and one 
a combination of all three of these qualities. We 
leave his readers to classify the five in accordance 
with our suggested scheme. 

Mrs. Deland is a new-comer among the tellers of 
short stories, but it is clear that she has mastered 
more than the rudiments of the art. Her work 
comes close to that of Miss Sarah Orne Jewett, not 
only in its choice of village scene and people, but 
also in its observation of the minuter humors of life, 
and in the delicacy of its treatment. Humor in 
any broader sense is lacking the writer, and the 
pathos of her humble tragedies seems to need some 
such relief as would be afforded by an occasional 
breeze blown from the brighter parts of life. She 
might profitably study " Octave Thanet," for exam- 
ple, with a view of making up for this defect. 
" Mr. Tommy Dove " and " A Fourth-class Ap- 
pointment " are decidedly the best of the five sto- 
ries, the latter being as effective a sermon on be- 
half of civil service reform as one often hears from 
a pulpit of any sort. If such stories could be mul- 
tiplied, they might prove the very best way of strik- 
ing the national conscience with shame for the 
" system " that has so cankered the vital organs of 
our political life. 

In passing from the volume just mentioned to 
the new series of Mr. Sullivan's " Day and Night 
Stories," we go all the way from realism to ro- 
mance, and find that, after all, romance is more sat-

isfying than the most faithful realism. As a speci- 
men of romance in miniature, it would not be easy 
to surpass " A Toledo Blade," which is a master- 
piece of both style and construction. The half 
dozen stories that go with it are only less admira- 
ble examples of fictive art. They possess the qual- 
ity of distinction in a marked degree the dis- 
tinction that betokens a mind well-cultured and 
responsive to a wide range of emotional appeal. 
Trifling as two or three of the stories appear at 
first sight, no one of them comes to an end without 
sounding, at least for a moment, some deep recess 
of the soul. Mr. Sullivan knows, far better than 
most tellers of tales, just what ought to be said, and 
what must be left unsaid, to make a story as effect- 
ive as possible. ,,,. ,,

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



We are wont to look very much 
askance at every new text-book of 
biology. So many of them are al- 
ready in the field struggling for life, many of them 
goaded to the unequal combat by the stimulating 
influences of their publishers' voices, that we insist 
now that each new competitor shall demonstrate his 
right to enter the lists. With a knowledge of the 
difficulties of the case, Professor John Bidgood has 
prepared his " Course of Practical Biology " ( Long- 
mans). There is one respect in which the work 
can fairly be said to be a departure. Each subject 
that is taken for study is treated in a series of para- 
graphs, each one of which directs some operation, 
the point of which is discussed in its immediate 
connection. This ought to have the effect of mak- 
ing a student thoughtful of the progress and sig- 
nificance of his work. We do not know of any 
other biological text-book in which this principle is 
so well applied as here. The subjects first taken up 
are several of the Fungi and Protococcus. A chap- 
ter on the Bacteria is included, with directions for 
some simpler experiments in culture and a consid- 
eration of their relation to disease. Then Chara, 
the Fern, and the Nettle are taken up in great de- 
tail. These complete the botanical side of the work, 
and occupy in all about half of the treatment. The 
fifty-four pages devoted to the Fungi and Proto- 
coccus form as good an introduction to the modes of 
biological work and thought as has yet appeared. 
We do not see, however, any sufficient reasons for 
the selection of Chara, or for the choice of the net- 
tle rather than of some others of the Phanerogams 
with a regularly racial flower as, for instance, 
the geranium, which latter can be had at all sea- 
sons at the florist's. We also regret that some of 
the filamentous algje were not touched on, if only 
briefly, as they are so very accessible for study. 
The animal forms selected are Amreba, Vorticella, 
Paramecium, Hydra, Anodonta, Astacus, and Rana. 
These are all well treated on the side of anatomy, 



but, as is the fashion in general text-books, they are 
very incomplete on the embryological side. On the 
other hand, the subject of Vertebrate Histology re- 
ceives very satisfactory attention. It will be seen 
that the work is one which covers a very large area. 
While it is necessarily greatly condensed, it is at 
the same time written in such a perfectly clear style 
that it is wholly intelligible, and the lay reader, as 
well as the student, will find it a very valuable 
presentation of the leading principles of the science. 
An Introduction of twenty-four pages covers the 
essentials of microscopical technique. The work is 
illustrated throughout, in part with the author's 
drawings and in part with many standard illustra- 
tions. In the histological part of the chapters on 
the Frog the cuts are largely from Quain's Anat- 
omy. 

interpretations Mr - Harold Littledale's " Essays on 
of Tennyson's Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King: " 

Idylls of the King. , -. .- -ii \ {. j 

(Macmillan) are based upon lec- 
tures written for students in India. It was cer- 
tainly worth while to offer the book in its present 
form to English and American students. Like 
other books prepared for the use of Indian under- 
graduates, this volume explains many things that 
any good dictionary could explain, but on the other 
hand it interprets many phases of the Idylls that 
no reference-book alludes to. There are chapters on 
the sources of the Arthurian story, on its growth from 
Malory to Tennyson, and on personages and localities 
spoken of in the modern epic. Then follow stud- 
ies of each Idyll, and annotations on particular words 
and obscure points. The work is by no means ex- 
haustive, but the material is carefully selected and 
well arranged. There is a constant comparison 
of Tennyson with Malory and the Mabinogion, and 
many interesting points of departure are suggested 
to the reader. The interpretation of the allegor- 
ical bearing of the Idylls is sensible and apprecia- 
tive, and the treatment of the rise of the legend, 
although brief, is in the main accurate. Rather 
strangely, however, Mr. Littledale takes no account 
of such an authoritative work as Professor Rhys's 
" Arthurian Legend." The work can readily be 
used as a handbook in a Tennyson class.

Introduction, there are seven chapters (expanded

Exiles," " Two Hours in the Social Cellar," < The 
Democracy of Darkness," "Why the Ishmaelites

portrays in these pages. He writes some passages 
that glow with an eloquence born of deep feeling 
and felicitous phrase ; hut as a rule he lays on the 
red paint a little too lavishly, while he makes it too 
apparent that he is striving to produce an effect. 
The grime and want and wretchedness which he 
depicts do exist ; these heartrending miseries are 
realities. So far as Mr. Flower reports what 
he himself has seen, his earnest words are calcu- 
lated to arrest attention and arouse sympathy. And 
it seems ungracious to criticise one whose heart is 
aglow with interest in behalf of our destitute and 
depraved fellows. But a careful reading of this 
volume leaves the impression that Mr. Flower's ob- 
servations in this noisome but pitiable realm have 
not been sufficiently painstaking and searching to 
make his pages of value to the scientific student of 
social problems or to the practical philanthropist. 
As photographs of certain conditions, they may stir 
people to thought and sympathy ; but they do not 
penetrate deep enough to lead to helpful action. 
There is no adequate discussion of causes or de- 
scription of remedies. When we come to the last 
chapter, " What of the Morrow ? " we are given 
nothing more than a few familiar and glittering 
generalities. The way out is not described ; the 
methods by which this Inferno may be turned into 
a Paradise are not defined. 



A new edition 
of Juvenal's 
Satires. 



Professor F. P. Nash's edition of 
the first two Satires of Juvenal 
(Houghton) shows sufficient schol- 
arship and considerable general information. It is 
put forth as a specimen of a larger work which will 
perhaps find a small circle of usefulness among the 
many learned editions of this more than sufficiently 
edited poet. It is hard to say for what readers the 
present volume is intended. No teacher will care 
to confine his class to the first two Satires. The col- 
lege graduate who desires to renew his acquaint- 
ance with the "authors" (if that much-invoked 
personage exists in America) will want more di- 
rect help in construing, and less erudition. The 
scholar who uses Mayor will find little if anything 
new here. Mr. Nash is under an illusion in this 
regard. The new matter in his notes is of the kind 
that a well-informed discursive teacher will some- 
times dictate to a class of students whom he has 
trained to bring up their lessons in good shape. It 
is not a serious contribution to the interpretation of 

Juvenal. 

Part VII. of the great English Dic- 

The seventh part . & . 

of the " Great En- tionary of the Philological Society 
* ary> " (Macmillan) extends from Consignif- 
icant to Crouching, and contains 5414 main words, 
936 combinations, and 1190 subordinate words and 
forms. Twenty-five per cent of the words are marked 
as either obsolete or incompletely naturalized. We 
quote an interesting prefatory note on the word 
Cross : " The influence of historical events on the 
fortunes of a word finds a remarkable exemplifica- 
tion in the case of Cross. What Roman in pres- 



ence of the ignominious associations that attached 
to its Latin original crux, and the expression, ' / in 
crucem ! ' could have conceived that a time would 
come when Cross would be one of the great diction- 
ary words of a far greater language than his own ; 
that besides embracing senses so distinct as the in- 
strument of crucifixion, a decoration of an order, a 
piece of money, an intermixture of breeds, not to 
mention thirty other applications, the word would 
also be an adjective, a verb, an adverb, and a pre- 
position ; and in each of these capacities give rise 
to a multitude of compounds and derivations, of 
which 284 would require treatment in the Diction- 
ary ? " This instalment of the Dictionary concludes 
the long series of " Con "-prefixed words, and goes 
well into " Cr," which is " noteworthy for its nu- 
merous echoic or imitative words expressing sounds, 
usually of an abrupt, rough, or harsh kind, and the 
actions accompanied by such sounds." 

Miss Grace King's "Jean Baptiste 

French dominion & ntti 

in the Valley of Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, in 
the Mississippi. the Makers of America" series 

(Dodd), is really a narrative of the establishment 
of the French government in the Mississippi Val- 
ley, so closely associated with this subject is Bien- 
ville's biography. Its pages, 327 in number, are 
very interesting, but naturally appeal more to the 
general reader than to the historian. They pre- 
sent in our own language and in a popular form 
what must otherwise be found in Margry's " De- 
couvertes et Etablissement de Francais." An ac- 
count of the discovery of the Mississippi is pre- 
faced by an outline story of the Le Moyne family. 
Then we are introduced to the Indian tribes of the 
lower Mississippi region, and told of Bienville's ex- 
cursion up the Red River Valley and of the many 
trials of this determined pioneer in the building up 
of a sort of Canada in southern North America. 
The history between 1725 and 1733 and between 
1743 and 1765 is left entirely blank. Of special 
interest to the student are a private letter from Bien- 
ville to his brother, and a copy of his will made in 
1765 and registered in Paris in 1767. 



Robert Morris, 
the financier 



Prof. William G. Sumner's "Rob- 
ert Morris," in the same series as 
of the Revolution. the volume j ust rev iewed, has made 

a collection of such facts from his " The Finan- 
cier and Finances of the Revolution " as he consid- 
ers of general interest. He certainly proves him- 
self an iconoclast ; and much of his iconoclasm is 
timely, to say the least. Popular images of Robert 
Morris are broken into a thousand pieces ; but the 
image substituted seems imperfect. The reader 
must go elsewhere for a satisfactory portrait of the 
great financier. So much attention is given to de- 
stroying, and the destroying is done with such en- 
ergy, that much of the merit in Morris's work is 
apt to be lost sight of. This is probably due in a 
measure to the facts that the book is an adaptation 
and that it is necessarily small.

The establishment Mr ' Julius H - Ward's volume on 
of the Anglican "The Life and Times of Bishop 

Church in America. Tiru-j. n . 

White is one of the best thus far 
published in the " Makers of America" series. It 
is of interest to the student as well as to the general 
reader. The author has attempted not only to give 
a personal portrait, but besides to show what part 
the " Patriarch of the Church in America " had in 
the civil and religious life of the time in which he 
lived. As an account of the transplanting of the 
Anglican Church, it is brief, salient, and well writ- 
ten. For color and accuracy in detail, the memory 
and knowledge of the Bishop's relatives are largely 
depended upon ; and materials are drawn from both 
original and secondary sources. There is an intro- 
duction by Bishop Potter. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Miss Martha F. Sesselberg has prepared a volume 
entitled "In Amazon Land" (Putnam), described as 
containing " adaptations from Brazilian writers, with 
original selections." What an " original selection " may 
be we know not, but we find the volume to contain a 
number of short Amazonian stories "A Tale of the 
Great River " being the longest some Brazilian legend- 
ary lore, and a number of amorphous fragments. No 
indication is given of the authorship of the " original " 
and other "selections." 

MADISON'S "Journal of the Federal Convention" of 
1787 one of the two foundation works of our consti- 
tutional history has been reprinted in a thick octavo 
volume of over eight hundred pages by Messrs. Albert, 
Scott & Co. The special feature of this reprint is a 
new and elaborate index, which is, we presume, to be 
credited to Mr. E. H. Scott, whose name appears upon 
the title-page as editor. 

FOUR late volumes of the Black and White " series 
(Harper), give us biographical sketches of as many 
American worthies, three of the number being on the 
death-roll of the past year. Mr. Laurence Hutton 
writes of Edwin Booth, Mr. John W. Chadwick of 
George William Curtis, Dr. Arthur Brooks of his 
brother, the late Bishop of Massachusetts, and Mr. 
Charles Dudley Warner of Washington Irving of the 
works rather than of the man. In the same series we 
have "The Decision of the Court," by Mr. Brander 
Matthews, a society comedy in which the author ap- 
proaches, but does not quite reach, the approved French 
manner. 

PUBLISHED under the auspices of the " Palestine Ex- 
ploration Fund" (Macmillan), we have a highly inter- 
esting series of seven lectures delivered to popular au- 
diences about a year ago. Among the lectures we note 
the following: Ancient Jerusalem," by Sir Charles W. 
Wilson; The Future of Palestine," by Major Conder; 
" The Hittites," by Dr. William Wright; The Mod- 
ern Traveller in Palestine," by Canon Dalton; and " The 
General Work of the Society," by Mr. Walter Besant. 
" The City and the Land " is the general title of the 
collection. 

THREE modern language dissertations, recently re- 
ceived by us, deserve a word of mention. " The Le- 
gend of the Holy Grail," by Mr. George McLean Har- 
per, is a reprint from the publications of the Modern 



Language Association. Dr. Edward Miles Brown takes 
as his subject The Language of the Rushworth Gloss to 
the Gospel of Matthew and the Mercian Dialect" (Gott- 
mgen). An Historical Study of the e- Vowel in Ac- 
cented Syllables in English " (Murphy) is the title of 
a thesis by Dr. Edwin W. Bowen. We may perhaps 
also mention in this connection an essay by Mr. Frank 
Chapman Sharp on " The ^Esthetic Element in Moral- 
ity," a booklet with the Macmillan imprint, but with 
very un-Macmillanlike typography. 

MR. HEXRY SWEET has published A Manual of Cur- 
rent Shorthand " (Macmillan), "intended to supply the 
want of a system of writing shorter and more compact 
than ordinary longhand, and at the same time not less 
distinct and legible." Mr. Sweet's method is upon a 
script basis, and is worked out in two forms : " one or- 
thographic, simply constructed, and of moderate speed, 
the other phonetic, in which brevity may be carried to 
its utmost legitimate limits." He claims that his system 
is the first workable pure script shorthand that has 
been brought out in England." The volume is very 
neatly printed. 

THE "Vertebrate Embryology" of Dr. A. Millies 
Marshall (Putnam) deals exhaustively with the embry- 
onic development of five typical vertebrate forms 

amphioxus, the frog, the chick, the rabbit, and man. 
The account of the latter form, in particular, is a highly 
satisfactory exposition of the present state of knowl- 
edge upon the subject, and will be found as useful to 
the physician as to the biologist. The figures are very 
numerous, and many of them are new. The work is 
handsomely printed.

The series of the " Story of the Nations " is being

under consideration for a similar translation. 

" Bulls and Blunders " is the title of a work by Mr. 
Marshall Brown, which is soon to be issued by Messrs. 
S. C. Griggs & Co. It gives examples of blunders in 
expression, drawn from many sources from the writ- 
ings of distinguished essayists, historians, and novelists ; 
from the speeches of statesmen in Congress and Parlia-

from the sayings of the intelligent and the stupid in all 
ranks of life. 

M. Brunetiere, who has long had a large part in the 
direction of the " Revue des Deux Mondes," takes the 
place of M. Buloz for the present. M. Brunetiere has 
been steadily bringing back the French criticism of lit- 
erature to the classical standards of the age of Louis 
XIV.; and his pertinacity is gradually building up 
a school. For nearly a dozen years he has annually 
published one or two solid volumes, made up from his 
lectures at the Ecole Normale and the Sorbonne. 

Beginning with 1894, an index to periodicals, on a 
new plan, will be published weekly in New York. Each 
successive issue during a quarter will recapitulate all 
the titles from the beginning of the quarter; at the end 
of the sixth, ninth, and twelfth months a special issue 
will recapitulate all the titles from the commencement 
of a year. This publication is made possible by the 
Mergenthaler and similar machines which cast type as 
a solid line. Its publisher will be Mr. J. Wellman 
Parks, who is at present in charge of the library exhibit 
of the National Department of Education in the United 
States Government Building at the World's Fair.

D. APPLETON & Co;s NEW BOOKS. 



The Life of Sir Richard F. Burton. 

By his Wife, ISABEL BURTON. With numerous Portraits, 
Illustrations, and Maps, and two colored Plates. In 2 vols., 
8vo, cloth, $12.00. 

The career of the late Sir Richard F. Burton, the distinguished 
traveler, and editor of "The Arabian Nights," was perhaps the most 
adventurous and romantic of any Englishman of the hist generation. 
He was an encyclopedic scholar, and much more than a scholar. He 
knew and had seen more of dark Africa than most men, and more of 
Mohammedan lands than any man. It seemed a simple thing for him 
to travel in disguise among fanatics where discovery meant death, but 
his life was manysided, and his biography illustrates a remarkable va- 
riety of interests. Lady Burton has proved her literary ability before, 
and iu these volumes she has done justice to an exceptional opportunity. 



An Innocent I m poster, and Other Stories. 

By MAXWELL GREY, author of " The Silence of Dean Mait- 
land," "In the Heart of the Storm," etc. Town and 
Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

Of " The Silence of Dean Maitland " The Boston Traveler says : " The 
story culminates in a scene which is almost unequalled and unexampled 
in fiction. ... As a tale of spiritual struggle, as a marvellously graphic 
and vital picture of the action and reaction of human life, it is a book 
that is destined to an extraordinary recognition and permanent fame in 
literature." 



From the Five Rivers. 

By Mrs. F. A. STEEL, author of " Miss Stuart's Legacy," etc. 

Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, 

$1.00. 

In her comprehension of the strange phases of Indian life, her sym- 
pathy with the reasoning and moods of the people, and her quick per- 
ception of effective and humorous contrasts, Mrs. Steel suggests Mr. 
Kipling in his pictures of the native Indians. Mrs. Steel, however, finds 
more characters among the women and children, whom she has sketched 
most sympathetically and vividly. Her book is a fascinating one in its 
mingling of comedy and pathos, and it is not strange that the writer 
has quickly earned an exceptional reputation in England. 



The Tutor's Secret. 

By VICTOR CHERBULIEZ, author of "Samuel Brohl and 
Company," " Saints and Sinners," etc. Town and Country 
Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 

" I have derived the most delicate and acute pleasure from the pe- 
rusal of 'The Tutor's Secret,' yet it is a pleasure which can only be 
obtained by a serene, leisurely, artistic enjoyment of its exquisite liter- 
ary qualities. ... I regard the extreme interest and attachment with 
which the character of the tutor inspires us as one of the greatest tri- 
umphs of Action, and all the other characters are admirably drawn." 
OUIDA, in the Fortnightly Review. 



A Truthful Woman in Southern California. 

By KATE SANBORN, author of "Adopting an Abandoned 
Farm," etc. A new volume in Appletons' Summer Series. 
12mo, cloth, 75 cents. 

In her vivacious and picturesque account of Southern California the 
author of "Adopting an Abandoned Farm," shows the quickness of 
observation, delightful humor, and originality which made her former 
books so popular with the reading public. Her book furnishes facts as 
well as amusement, and it will have a permanent vlue as a truthful 
picture of Southern California. 



Camp-Fires of a Naturalist. 

By CLARENCE E. EDWORDS. The Story of Fourteen Expe- 
ditions after North American Mammals. From the Field 
Notes of LEWIS LINDSAY DYCHE, A.M., M.S., Professor 
of Zoology and Curator of Birds and Mammals in the Kansas 
State University. With numerous Illustrations. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

This took sketches big game hunting in the West from a fresh point 
of view. The author describes the actual adventures and experiences 
of a naturalist who has hunted from Mexico to the northern confines 
of British Columbia, pursuing grizzly bears, mountain sheep, elk, moose, 
and other rare game. As an outdoor book of camping and hunting this 
possesses a timely interest, and it also has the merit of scientific exact- 
ness in the descriptions of the habits, peculiarities, and haunts of wild 
animals. 



True Riches. 

By FRANCOIS COPPEE. A new volume in Appletons' Summer 

Series. 12mo, cloth, 75 cents. 

The charm of Francois Coppee's style has become familiar to Amer- 
ican readers, who will find that the author has not fallen below his 
highest mark in this entertaining and sympathetic book. " True Riches" 
is bright, wholesome, and interesting, and, although the author is too 
true an artist to insist upon his moral, he suggests one which perhaps 
has a peculiarly timely value. 



Many Inventions. 

By RUDYARD KIPLING. Containing fourteen stories, sev- 
eral of which are now published for the first time, and two 
poems. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" ' Many Inventions ' will confirm Mr. Kipling's reputation. . . . 
We could cite with pleasure sentences from almost every page, and 
extract incidents from almost every story. But to what end ? Here is 
the completest book that Mr. Kipling has yet given us in workmanship, 
the weightiest and most humane in breadth of view." Pull Mull Ga- 
zette. 

" Mr. Kipling's powers as a story-teller are evidently not diminishing. 
We advise everybody to buy ' Many Inventions ' and to profit by some 
of the best entertainment that modern fiction has to offer." A'ew 
York Sun. 

" ' Many Inventions ' will be welcomed wherever the English language 
is spoken. . . . Every one of the stories bears the imprint of a master 
who conjures up incident as if by magic, and who portrays character, 
scenery, and feeling with an ease which is only exceeded by the bold- 
ness of force." Boston Globe. 



The Simple Adventures of a Memsahib. 

A new book by SARA JEANNETTK DUNCAN, author of "A 
Social Departure " and "An American Girl in London." 
With many illustrations by F. H. TOWNSEND. 12mo, cloth, 

$1.50. 

" It is impossible for Sara Jeannette Duncan to be otherwise than 
interesting. Whether it be a voyage around the world, or an American 
girl's experiences in London society, or the adventures pertaining to 
the establishment of a youthful couple in India, there is always an atmos- 

?here, a quality, a charm peculiarly her own." Brooklyn Stnndard- 
'nion. 

"Another witty and delightful book." Philadelphia Times. 
" It is like traveling without leaving one's armchair to read it. Miss 
Duncan has the descriptive and narrative gift in large measure, and she 
brings vividly before us the street scenes, the interiors, the bewilder- 
ingly queer natives, the gayeties of the English colony." Philadelphia 
Telegraph.

A MID WA Y RE VIE W. 

The Columbian Exposition has now been 
open to the public for a period of four months, 
and ten million paid admissions have been reg- 
istered by the turnstiles at the gates. Seven 
or eight million more are practically assured, 
and, if an extension of the term into the open- 
ing weeks of November should be found prac- 
ticable, it is by no means impossible that the 
number of admissions now recorded should be 
doubled before the close. The prospect is thus 



very cheering, and satisfies, perhaps exceeds, 
all reasonable anticipations. That the Fair 
will pay every dollar of its bonded indebted- 
ness is now beyond a doubt ; and few, having 
any adequate conception of the undertaking, 
ever supposed that it would do much more than 
this. The stockholders, including the City of 
Chicago, understood from the outset that their 
subscriptions were largely in the nature of a 
gift, and looked for their reward in ways more 
or less indirect. That reward, even in the tan- 
gible form of pecuniary profit, bids fair to be 
realized by many of them not, of course, by 
all, for, in the very nature of things, such a 
distribution could not find its way back into 
the exact channels whence the contributions 
flowed. In spite of the many instances in which 
individual expectation has come short of real- 
ization, there cannot be the least doubt that 
the community as a whole has reason to be 
grateful to the Fair for the influx of currency 
and the stimulation of trade that have come in 
its train. The severity of the commercial de- 
pression, elsewhere so marked, has in this city 
been noticeably mitigated, and many an insti- 
tution has been saved from financial disaster. 
Of the intangible rewards that will come from 
the influence of so magnificent a demonstration 
of the possibilities of civilization it would be 
impossible to speak adequately without speak- 
ing at far greater length than our space per- 
mits ; these rewards will be disclosed in hun- 
dreds of subtle and unforeseen ways in the 
years to come. 

Although the term appointed is now two- 
thirds complete, it is probably fair to say, in 
view of the increased numbers that will throng 
the streets of the White City during its closing 
months, that the exhibition is but half over, 
that we have now reached a point midway in 
its course. At such a point in the history of 
any great enterprise it is well to pause for a 
moment, reviewing the accomplishment of the 
past, and regarding the probable outcome of 
the future. It is the purpose of this article to 
take such a backward and forward glance from 
one point of view only, from that of the ideal 
possibilities of the enterprise as contrasted with 
the actual realization of the daring and high- 
principled conception with which its directors

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



set out. If, in making this survey, we have 
occasion to subject the management of the 
Fair to severe adverse criticism, it must be re- 
membered that from other points of view, which 
we do not here attempt to assume, that man- 
agement has deserved the highest praise. There 
has, for example, been no taint of jobbery in 
the direction of its vast and lavish scheme of 
expenditure ; there has been no lack of self- 
sacrificing devotion, prompted by genuine civic 
and personal pride, on the part of the execu- 
tive officers of the organization. 

The original conception of the Exposition 
was characterized by a fine disregard of the 
mean practical motives that might so easily 
have come to prevail in the councils of its man- 
agement. It was clearly understood that the 
mere suggestion of a universal exhibition to be 
held in this city would be met all over the world 
with the cry, " Can any good thing come out 
of Chicago ? " and it was resolved that the cry 
should be silenced, not by words, but by most 
effective deeds. The common expectation that 
a Chicago Fair would prove a vast exemplifi- 
cation of the material and commercial aspects 
of civilization should be met by a Fair in which 
art was exalted above manufacturing and the 
ideal above the narrowly practical. In this 
spirit was inaugurated the whole magnificent 
plan for a hitherto unequalled exhibition of ar- 
chitecture and landscape gardening, of music, 
and the arts of form, of science and industry, 
of objective and intellectual cosmopolitanism. 
In this spirit the best architects, sculptors, and 
painters were called together to design and dec- 
orate the buildings, and the best landscape gar- 
deners to beautify the site, all being given the 
greatest possible freedom to do their work with 
artistic effect alone in view. In this spirit a great 
musical leader was engaged, given practically 
unlimited resources, and told to prepare such an 
exhibit of his art as the world had never before 
known. In this spirit commissions were sent to 
foreign countries to collect the masterpieces of 
modern art, and expeditions were fitted out to 
bring together from the remote parts of earth 
the relics of primitive man. In this spirit a large 
sum of money was set aside to endow the city 
of the Fair with a permanent sculptured me- 
morial of the eventful year, and a still larger 
sum of money was devoted to the strictly in- 
tellectual work of the World's Congress Aux- 
iliary, work that could not be expected to yield 
any but an intellectual return. We have by 
no means exhausted the list of the methods by 
which the directors of the Exposition sought 



once for all to refute the widespread notion 
that Chicago was a community devoid of ideal 
interests, sought definitively to substitute newer 
and more worthy associations for those com- 
monly linked with its name. The methods, as 
a whole, were characterized by large-minded- 
ness ; they brought moral and intellectual con- 
siderations within their purview ; they took 
thought for the verdict of the future rather 
than for the clamor of the present. 

It is unpleasant now, in our midway retro- 
spect of the course followed by the directors of 
the Exposition, to be forced to chronicle a mel- 
ancholy derogation from the high motives which 
controlled the inception and early history of 
their work. The commercial motive has forced 
its way to the surface, and has become the con- 
trolling influence in their action. The object 
of the Fair is now frankly proclaimed to be 
that of making as much money for its stock- 
holders as possible. Amusement, of cheap and 
even vulgar sorts, is being substituted for educa- 
tion, because most people prefer being amused 
to being instructed. The popular devices of the 
country fair are being resorted to, and the 
greased pole figured in a recently published 
list of attractions for a particular day. Such 
pleasing novelties, announced in great variety 
from day to day, are converting the Exposition, 
as far as it is possible, into a huge circus (the 
Plaisance furnishing the sideshows), and mark 
a process of degradation aptly described by its 
sponsors as that of " barnumising the Fair." 
Now all this would have been deplorable enough 
had it been necessary to save the Fair from 
bankruptcy. But there has never been any 
serious danger that the income would be in- 
sufficient to pay the bills and meet the bonded 
indebtedness of the Exposition, while the stock 
subscriptions were made, as we have already 
pointed out, with a very clear understanding 
that no considerable fraction of them would 
come directly back. The directors were thus 
in the position of trustees of an enterprise un- 
dertaken less for financial returns than for the 
glory of accomplishing a great and worthy ob- 
ject. To all appearances, they started out with 
a distinct consciousness of the high nature of 
this trust ; to all appearances, they have made 
to greed at least a partial sacrifice of their 
principles. 

The most signal illustration of their weak- 
ness, and of the decline of their ideals under 
the pressure of the commercial spirit, is offered 
by their treatment of the musical department of 
the Fair. To begin with, they incurred large 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

preliminary expenses in the erection of two 
concert buildings. They then placed the mu- 
sical arrangements in the most competent of 
possible hands, contracted for the season with a 
large orchestra, and made many engagements 
with artists at home and abroad. Their aim, 
which no one can deny was well taken, was to 
place the music of the Fair upon an equal foot- 
ing with the painting, the sculpture, and the 
architecture. For three months, or therea- 
bouts, the plans thus made were carried out to 
the satisfaction of all whose opinion is worth 
considering. Then came the disgraceful news- 
paper attack upon the musical director, by 
which at first they very properly refused to be 
influenced. But at last, under the pressure of 
large expenses and unsatisfactory receipts, they 
weakly accepted the resignation generously of- 
fered by the musical director (who may well 
have been disheartened by the malignant in- 
sults heaped upon him by the press, but who 
deserved, on that account all the more, the un- 
hesitating support of the directors), and calmly 
announced their intention of repudiating the 
contracts they had made with the orchestra. 
The orchestra could not, of course, be thus dis- 
missed, for its legal rights are perfectly clear ; 
but the fact that it will remain brings no credit 
to the directors who sought deliberately to ig- 
nore those rights. The musical director, like- 
wise, might have remained had he chosen, and 
the acceptance of his generosity is even less 
creditable to the directors than their avowed 
intention of violating their contracts with the 
orchestra. Naturally the directors sought to 
excuse their extraordinary conduct in this mat- 
ter, and therefore pleaded the necessity of a 
reduction in the running expenses of the Fair. 
What this plea amounts to we have already 
seen, and had it amounted to much more it 
would not have justified a clearly dishonorable 
course. A secondary plea, put forward in all 
seriousness, although its absurdity is appar- 
ent, was to the effect that the musical depart- 
ment of the Fair should be disestablished be- 
cause it was not paying for itself. As if any 
department of the Fair, or the Fair as a whole, 
paid, or was expected to pay, for itself ! On 
this theory the Art Building might be closed 
to the public, or its wall stripped of paintings 
and hung with chromos. The fact is, of course, 
that the department of music, besides contrib- 
uting greatly, like the department of fine arts, 
to the general attractiveness of the Exposition, 
and thus paying for itself in the only sense that 
could reasonably be required, did further pay 



for itself in a specific sense, to the amount of 
the admission fees charged for some of the more 
important concerts. In this respect the mu- 
sical feature of the Fair had a distinct advant- 
age over all the others, and should have been 
singled out, if at all, to be retained rather than 
to be cut off. 

We might adduce other illustrations of the 
unprincipled, or at least low-principled, meth- 
ods that have come to prevail of late in the 
management of the Exposition. The cheese- 
paring policy that would have cut off current 
expenditures for music, leaving the costly mu- 
sic halls unused, may be parallelled by the pol- 
icy that has crippled the work of the World's 
Congress Auxiliary. Although for that work 
a large building appropriation was made at the 
start, the petty sums needed for clerical help r 
for the printing of programmes, and for keep- 
ing a record of the proceedings, have either 
been grudgingly bestowed or withheld alto- 
gether. The attitude of the directors toward* 
the question of Sunday closing is a further 
striking illustration of the decline from prin- 
ciple to expediency ; it has even caused many 
to doubt whether principle was involved at any 
stage of the discussion, and has earned the 
contempt of both parties alike. These, and 
other instances, might be enlarged upon as we 
have enlarged upon the music episode, but that 
episode is so typical of the class to which it be- 
longs that its lesson does not need reinforce- 
ment. When, in the future, we shall look back 
upon the history of the great exhibition, it is 
unpleasant to think that our view will include 
so much to awaken regret, when we might so 
easily have bequeathed to posterity the mem- 
ory of a noble purpose, not only planned with 
regard to ideal ends, but consistently carried 
out with no other than those ends in view. 



THE AUGUST CONGRESSES. 
The Education meetings of the World's Congress 
Auxiliary, summarized at length in the last issue 
of THE DIAL, have been followed during the five 
weeks from July 31 to September 2, inclusive, by 
meetings devoted to the consideration of a great va- 
riety of subjects. Art and Engineering occupied 
the first of the five weeks now under discussion. 
The Art Congresses included meetings of painters 
and sculptors, decorative and ceramic artists, ar- 
chitects, and photographers. The American In- 
stitute of Architects met in connection with these 
Congresses, and its sessions were probably the most 
important held in this department. A notable fea- 
ture of the Congress on Painting and Sculpture was 



108 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



the lecture by Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith on " The 
Illustrative Arts of America." The Engineering 
Congress must be ranked among the great successes 
of the Auxiliary scheme. The number of foreign 
delegates was very large, and among them were the 
most eminent regresentatives of the profession. Be- 
sides the regular sections of civil, mechanical, min- 
ing, metallurgical, and military engineers, there was 
an important section devoted to engineering educa- 
tion, and another to the subject of aerial naviga- 
tion. The engineering sessions were mainly given 
over to the discussion of papers which had been 
printed in advance and circulated among the mem- 
bers. The week beginning August 7 was devoted 
to the subject of Government, and the proceedings 
included a Congress on Suffrage, a Congress on 
City Government, and Congresses on the reform of 
jurisprudence and of the civil service. The week 
of August 14 was set apart for a number of Con- 
gresses not easily classifiable under the regular de- 
partments of the Auxiliary, the most important of 
them being a Congress on Africa, historical, geo- 
graphical, ethnological, literary, scientific, religious, 
and social. The Arbitration and Peace Congress, 
also comprised within this week, was of much in- 
terest. Science and Philosophy held the Auxiliary 
fort during the week beginning August 21. Chem- 
istry, Meteorology, Geology, Electricity, and Math- 
ematics and Astronomy were the subjects of five 
sections, each of which called out a considerable at- 
tendance of specialists. The Electricity Congress 
included the special meetings of a small body of 
representative electricians, sent to the Congress by 
various countries as governmental delegates, and 
charged with the task of adopting a uniform inter- 
national system of electrical units. Dr. von Helm- 
holtz, who represented the German government in 
this " Chamber of Delegates," was naturally the 
guest of honor even among men so distinguished as 
his associates. " Psychical Science " was the sub- 
ject of a Congress some of whose sessions must 
have made the judicious grieve. It was given dig- 
nity by the presence and frequent participation of 
Mr. Frederic W. H. Myers, and, we need hardly 
add, proved the popular success of the week. The 
Philosophical Congress was of surprising interest, 
and its discussions proved to be animated, stimulat- 
ing, and serious. Among those who took part in 
them were Professors Josiah Royce, J. Macbride 
Sterrett, J. Clark Murray, Paul Shorey, and Les- 
ter F. Ward. The Congresses for the week begin- 
ning August 28, just ending, have included, first of 
all, Zoology and Anthropology, both really belong- 
ing to the week preceding, but necessarily postponed. 
Strictly speaking, the subject of this week's Con- 
gresses has been Economic Science, with special sec- 
tions on Labor, Profit-sharing, and Single Tax. 
The Jewish Congress, also included within the pro- 
gramme of this week, anticipates the Congresses in 
the Department of Religion, which will begin Sep- 
tember 4, and take up the remainder of the month. 
It will be seen from the rapid survey above given 



that the Congresses of the month of August have 
been among the most important of the whole series, 
and have given President Bonney renewed reason 
to congratulate himself upon the success of the im- 
mense organization at whose head he stands. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"THE USE AND ABUSE OF SLANG." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Generally as a man grows older he gains confidence 
in his own abilities; and I must confess that the arti- 
cles evoked by the little linguistic essays of mine which 
have appeared in the July number of " Harper's Mag- 
azine " for now three years are gradually giving me a 
great conceit as to my own ability to write sentences 
which can be misunderstood despite my utmost endeavor 
to make my meaning plain. If, for example, I implied 
as Mr. Pitts Duffield, in his very courteous commu- 
nication in THE DIAL of August 16 seems to suggest 
that " all the rubbish " of accidental and temporary 
slang should sweep " along undammed," I implied what 
I did not mean. What I desired to say, and what I 
thought I had said, was that the exclusive control of 
language ought not to be in the hands of a single class, 
even though that class were composed wholly of " our 
most competent scholars." I am sorry that there are 
not more clergymen and more college professors in the 
Congress of the United States; but I should gravely 
doubt the action of Congress if it were composed wholly 
of college professors or of clergymen.

THE " NEW THEOLOGY " AND QUACKERY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As an interested reader of THE DIAL, permit me to call 
attention to a misleading statement in your issue for Au- 
gust 16. In your leading editorial of that date, you say: 
" The mass of newspaper readers approve of the pa- 
per so carefully adjusted to their tastes, just as the pa- 
tients of our practitioner of the ' new medicine ' or the 
hearers of our preacher of the ' new theology ' approve 
of the quackery of which they are the willing dupes." 
This statement makes the " new theology " synony- 
mous with " quackery." And, though the writer of this 
protest is too radical to be identified with the " new theol- 
ogy," he believes that the movement known as the " new 
theology " is very far from quackery. Lyman Abbott, 
Newman Smyth, and Dr. Briggs are the acknowledged 
leaders of this movement. And, whatever else may be 
said of them, they cannot be counted men who carefully 
adjust their preaching or their teaching to the tastes of 
their hearers; nor can they be called theologic quacks. 

Feeling sure that your candor will induce you to cor- 
rect this (to me) unjustifiable statement, or, should you 
still hold to the view expressed, to justify that view, I 
am, very truly yours, LEON A- HARVEY. 

Des Moines, Iowa, August 19, 1893. 

[We willingly print the above letter, but cannot 
refrain from an expression of surprise that our 
meaning, in the article referred to, should have been 
entirely misunderstood. In the opening sentences of 
the paragraph to which our correspondent takes ex- 
ception, we had occasion to define a certain type of 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

clergymen who should preach a doctrine care- 
fully selected for its paying qualities " and the sim- 
ilar type of physician " who should take up with 
what he knew to be quackery because he expected 
from it large financial returns." Our object in the 
selection and definition of these types was merely 
to illustrate, by the analogy of other professions, 
the leading principle of the "new journalism." 
Later on in the paragraph, speaking of the news- 
paper produced by the new journalism," we used 
the language that our correspondent has so misun- 
derstood. The words " our practitioner " and " our 
preacher," of course, merely referred back to the 
definitions previously given, to the offensive types 
of clergyman and physician selected for the purpose 
of illustrating by comparison the turpitude of the 
journalist. It is very surprising to us that the words 
should have been construed into an attack upon Dr. 
Abbott and Dr. Briggs, or upon the "new theol- 
ogy " i* 1 an y other than the narrow special sense 
just before carefully defined. EDRS. DIAL.] 

AN UNAUTHORITATIVE AUTHORITY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

At page 114 of his " Recent Exemplifications of False 
Philology" (New York, 1872), Dr. Hall said: "To the 
authorities for expressions like is being built, which I 
formerly adduced, I can now add Shelley, Mrs. Shelley, 
Dr. Arnold, Dr. Newman, Mr. Ruskin, and the Rev. 
Charles Kingsley." 

Although there might be different opinions concern- 
ing the value, as authorities for grammatical usage, of 
most of the writers mentioned at least when regarded 
separately, yet there could be hardly any doubt as to 
the importance that would be attached to the name of 
John Henry Newman. What Dr. Hall himself thought 
of Dr. Newman as an authority has been shown in pas- 
sages quoted by me in a former letter. I will quote 
one of them again, at somewhat greater length, because 
it contains the gist of the matter now to be considered. 

In an appendix to his " Modern English " (1873, pp. 
321-359) Dr. Hall returns to the discussion of is being 
built, and there (pp. 328-9) says: 

" I need, surely, name no more, among the dead, who found 
is being built, or the like, acceptable, . . . and we all know 
that the sort of phraseology under consideration is daily be- 
coming more and more common. The best-written of the 
English reviews, magazines, and journals are perpetually 
marked by it ; and some of the choicest of living English 
writers employ it freely. Preeminent among these stands 
Dr. Newman, who wrote, as far back as 1846 : ' At this very 
moment, souls are being led into the Catholic Church, on the 
most various and independent impulses, and from the most 
opposite directions." (Essays Critical and Historical, Vol. 2, 
p. 448). 

" Bishop Wilberforce shall be summoned next." [Then fol- 
low four illustrative quotations from the bishop's writings.] 

No other instance of the use of this form of expres- 
sion by Dr. Newman is quoted or referred to by Dr. 
Hall in this appendix of thirty-nine pages (where less 
important authorities are quoted several times), although 
Dr. Hall had previously said (p. 292) that he had 
" studied nearly every line of Dr. Newman's voluminous 
writings." This quotation from Newman, with others 
from other writers illustrative of " imperfects passive," 
was contributed by Dr. Hall to " A New English Dic- 



tionary on Historical Principles," where, shortened, it 
appears under Be. 

Now an inquisitive reader would like to know whether 
Dr. Hall, at the time he wrote the remarks quoted above, 
had knowledge of such a number of instances where Dr. 
Newman had used this locution in his voluminous writ- 
ings, that he, Dr. Hall, could fairly say, either by direct 
assertion or by implication, that Dr. Newman employed 
it freely." It will be noticed that the propriety of 
is being built is not questioned here; that has been lone 
settled. 

I do not know how many examples of the " imperfect 
passive" have been added from Cardinal Newman's 
writings, by Dr. Hall and others, to the one quoted above ; 
but Professor Earle, in " The Philology of the English 
Tongue " (third edition, Oxford, 1879, pp. 546-7) has 
given to the public very distinct information as to New- 
man's feeling concerning is being: 

" From an early friend of Dr. Newman's I learnt that he 
had long ago expressed a strong dislike to the cumulate form- 
ula is being. 1 desired to be more particularly informed, and 
Dr. Newman wrote as follows to his friend : ' It surprises me 
that my antipathy to is being existed so long ago. It is as 
keen and bitter now as ever it was, though I don't pretend 
to be able to defend it. ... Now I know nothing of the his- 
tory of the language, and cannot tell whether all this will 
stand, but this I do know, that, rationally or irrationally, I 
have an undying, never-dying hatred to is being, whatever ar- 
guments are brought in its favour. At the same time I fully 
grant that it is so convenient in the present state of the lan- 
guage, that I will not pledge myself I have never been guilty 
of using it." 

Although I have noticed two instances (one in a let- 
ter), besides the one cited above by Dr. Hall, where 
the " imperfect passive " was employed by Dr. New- 
man, yet I am confident that its use by him at least 
in print was very rare. 

Surprise which one feels at the weakness of the sup- 
port to be had from Dr. Newman is increased by sur- 
prise from a different source when one compares with 
the quotation from " Modern English " given above Dr. 
Hall's opinion of Bishop Wilberforce as shown in other 
parts of the same volume. 

" Would that pessimists could learn to stifle their flatulent 
lamentations. Listen to another [Bishop Wilberforce], one 
who, for all his unctuous clutter, is, certainly, the most me- 
chanical of contemporary prelates." (P. 290, footnote.) 
And at page 48 Dr. Hall pays this compliment to the 
Bishop's English: 

"The self-accommodating Bp. Wilberforce, when, a few 
years ago, he wrote of 'the alone Saviour,' was ridiculed, in 
that, when he cleansed his skirts of Low-churchism, he did 
not fully unlearn its characteristic jargon." 

Perhaps Dr. Hall did not intend to include Bishop 
Wilberforce (with Dr. Newman) in " some of the choic- 
est of living English writers"; but if he did not, page 
329 needs amending. R Q WlLLIAM8-

A LARGE part of the forthcoming biography of Whit- 
tier will consist of letters never before published, in ac- 
cordance with his wish that he might be allowed to 
speak for himself, as far as possible, in his memoirs. In 
these letters we find the history of all his principal 
poems, the circumstances under which they were writ- 
ten, the changes made in them, and the reasons for the 
changes. Whittier's literary executor, Mr. S. T. Pick- 
ard, of Portland, Me., requests the loan of any letters 
by the poet which contain passages of public interest.

THREE NEW BOOKS ox INDIA.* 



Within its moderate scope and intention, 
Mr. Edward Carpenter's " From Adam's Peak 
to Elephanta : Sketches in Ceylon and India " 
is decidedly the best book of recent East In- 
dian travel that has come to our notice. In 
addition to his series of brilliant pen-pictures 
of Oriental life and landscape, Mr. Carpenter 
offers us some instructive comment on current 
Indian questions, and his broader generaliza- 
tions touching the status and outlook of the 
Empire are pertinent and have an assuring 
ring of candor and mature conviction. To the 
rather hopeless social relations between Anglo- 
Indians and natives a separate chapter is de- 
voted, and the volume closes with a review of 
the " Old Order " of caste and communism, 
and of the working of the " New Influences " 
(chiefly Western science and commercialism) 
under whose solvent force old social and polit- 
ical growths now promise to disintegrate, agree- 
ably to the Spencerian formula. Religious 
topics are interestingly treated. We are af- 
forded a glimpse or two behind the scenes of 
the Hindu ritual, and the four expository chap- 
ters on the esoteric religious lore of South In- 
dia are the fruit of the author's introduction 
into circles of traditional teaching usually 
closed against the English. We may note 
here, in passing, that while in Madras Mr. Car- 
penter visited Adyar, the Theosophist head- 
quarters. 

" The Theosophist villa, with roomy lecture-hall and 
library, stands pleasantly among woods on the bank of 
a river and within half a mile of the sea. Passing from

Guru. . . . Madame Blavatsky knew Col. Olcott's

portraits is that they were done by a German artist 
whom she met in the course of her travels. Consider- 
ing him competent for the work, she projected the im- 
ages of the two Gurus into his mind, and he painted 
from the mental pictures she placing her hand on his 
head during the operation. The German artist-medium 
accounted for the decidedly mawkish expression of both 
faces, as well as for the considerable likeness to each 
other which, considering that Kout Houmi dates from 
Cashmere, and the other from Thibet, might not have 
been expected. . . . Keightley was evidently much im- 
pressed by the ' old lady's ' clairvoyant power, saying 
that sometimes in her letters from England she dis- 
played a knowledge of what was going on at Adyar, 
which he could not account for." 

It is due the author to add that he does not go 
into a serious discussion of the Adyar " mys- 
teries." 

We shall confine our notice of the more pic- 
turesque portion of Mr. Carpenter's narrative 
to the chapter on Benares an ancient city, 
to which the " cheap-and-nasty puffing, profit- 
mongering, enterprising, energetic, individual- 
istic business " (our author is a fierce Ruskin- 
ian) of mongrel Bombay and Calcutta has not 
yet penetrated. Benares, the Indian Mecca, 
is situated in the midst of a great and populous 
plain, on the banks of the sacred Ganges. That 
the Ganges, a majestic river, and, like the Nile, 
the prime fertilizer of its adjacent plains, should 
be the object of a cult is easily intelligible. 
The myth is a striking one. In the Mahabar- 
ata, Siva is god of the Himalayas or rather he 
Is the Himalayas the icy crags his brow, the 
forests his hair : 

" Ganga, the beautiful Ganga, could not descend to 
earth till Siva consented to receive her on his head. So 
impetuously then did she rush down (in rain) that the 
god grew angry and locked up the floods amid his laby- 
rinthine hair till at last he let them escape and find 
their way to the plains." 

To Benares come pilgrims by the hundred and 
the thousand the year round, to make their 
offering at its 5000 shrines, and to bathe in the 
Ganges, or to burn the bodies of their friends 
and scatter their ashes upon the stream. The 
river side is a wonderful, a richly Oriental scene 
a wilderness of marble stairs, terraces, and 
jutting platforms, stretching away in pictur- 
esque disorder for a mile or more along the 
banks, and enlivened, especially on festal days, 
with throngs of natives in parti-colored rai- 
ment, going down to or coming up from the 
water, or sitting about in groups under gay 
awnings or huge straw umbrellas, chatting, or 
drinking in, for the thousandth time, the mar- 
vels of the story-teller. Here is a string of 
pilgrims carrying their scanty belongings in

pear a half-dozen young men, stripped for their 
morning exercise, with their Indian clubs in 
their hands " their yellow and brown bodies 
shining in the early sun "; here are the men 
selling marigolds for the bathers to cast into 
the stream ; there is a group of children in 
festal finery, with silver toe-rings and bangles, 
stepping timidly down the steep stair, the same 
foot always first, to the water ; here is a yogi 
(saint), surrounded by a little circle of admir- 
ers ; there are boats and a quay, and ominous- 
looking piles of wood for burning the dead ; 
and there beyond, the dismal spectacle of a 
burning ghaut. 

Touching the rite of bathing in the Ganges, 
the author observes : 

" One might think that in order to induce people to 
bathe by thousands in muddy, half-stagnant water, thick 
with funeral ashes and drowned flowers, and here and 
there defiled by a corpse or a portion of one, there must 
be present an immense amount of religious or other fer- 
vor. But nothing of the kind. Except in a few, a very 
few, cases there was no more of this than there is in 
the crowd going to or from a popular London church 
on Sunday evening. Mere blind habit was written on 
most faces. ... It simply had to be done." 

One morning our author accompanied a 
Hindu friend, who wanted to bathe at a par- 
ticular ghaut, to the river-side. It was a spring 
festival, the ghauts were thronged, and charac- 
teristic scenes and objects were on every hand. 

" As we approached the river the alleys began to get 
full of people coming up after their baths to the vari- 
ous temples pretty to see the women in all shades of 
tawny gold, primrose, saffron, or salmon-pink, bearing 
their brass bowls and saucers full of flowers, and a sup- 
ply of Ganges water." 

It was early spring, and a group of women 
coming up fresh from the water in their drip- 
ping garments were shivering in the chill air 
as they took their stand near by. 

" Their long cotton clothes clung to their limbs, and 
I wondered how they would dress themselves under 
these conditions. The steps were reeking with wet and 
mud, and could not be used for sitting on. They man- 
aged, however, to unwind their wet things and at the 
same time to put on dry ones so deftly that in a short 
time and without any exposure of their bodies they were 
habited in clean and bright attire." 

In the course of the walk they came to one of 
the burning ghauts a sufficiently gruesome 
sight a blackened hollow running down to 
the water's edge with room for three funeral 
pyres. 

" As we stood there a corpse was brought down 
wrapped in an unbleached cloth (probably the same it 
wore in life) and slung beneath a pole which was car- 
ried on the shoulders of two men. Round about on the 
jutting verges of the hollow the male relatives sat 



perched upon their heels, with their cloths drawn over 
their heads spectators of the whole operation. . . . 
The body is placed upon the pyre, which generally in 
the case of the poor people is insufficiently large, a scanty 
supply of gums and fragrant oils is provided, the near- 
est male relative applies the torch himself and then 
there remains nothing but to sit for hours and watch 
the dread process, and at the conclusion, if the burning 
is complete, to collect the ashes and scatter them on the 
water, and if not, to throw the charred remains them- 
selves into the sacred river." 

While the author was taking note of this sick- 
ening business so hideously, not to say pro- 
fanely, suggestive, with its spices and aromat- 
ics, of cookery there appeared opportunely 
on the scene a self-mutilating fakir. This re- 
ligionist, scorning the lenten observances and 
mortifications of milder creeds, humored his 
amiable deity by holding the left arm uplifted 
in lifelong penance. 

" There was no doubt about it; the bare limb, to some 
extent dwindled, went straight up from the shoulder, 
and ended in a little hand, which looked like the hand 
of a child with fingers inbent and ending in long claw- 
like nails, while the thumb, which was disproportion- 
ately large, went straight up between the second and 
third fingers. . . . His extended right hand entreated 
a coin, which I gladly gave him, and after invoking 
some kind of blessing he turned away through the crowd 
his poor dwindled hand and half-closed fingers visible 
for some time over the heads of the people." 

Naturally, all this solemnity had its humor- 
ous interludes ; and the author was especially 
amused by the antics of a goat and a crow 
which knowingly stuck close to the altars and 
between them nibbled and nicked off the edible 
offerings as fast as the pious deposited them 
thereon. 

In his discussion of the Indian race-problem 
Mr. Carpenter is very frank and not at all 
optimistic. The sway of the Briton in a land 
he cannot really inhabit, and over a swarming 
and potentially powerful race that is to him 
as oil is to water, is an anomaly. John Bull 
in India is at best a sort of armed moderator, 
tolerated for the time because he measurably 
secures to the thrifty the fruits of their thrift, 
and restrains general throat-cutting. He does 
not like his position, but he accepts it, like old 
Mr. Trapbois, " for a consideration." Cer- 
tainly his " subjects " do not like him. Says 
a Hindu friend to our author : 

"The vaunted administrative ability of the English 
is a fiction. They make good policemen and keep or- 
der when the people acquiesce that is all. If this 
acquiescence ceases, as it must, when the people rightly 
or wrongly believe their religion and family life in dan- 
ger from the government, the English must pack up 
and go, and woe to the English capitalist and profes- 
sional man."

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Between the Englishman and the native is a 
profound and impassable gulf of race differ- 
ence, of race dislike " a deep-set ineradicable 
incompatibility." The primary point of view 
of each is impossible to the other. It is the 
old spiritual feud of Aristotelian and Platon- 
ist the two great types, as Leibniz said, of 
humanity. With the profoundly religious char- 
acter of the social system of India, the mate- 
rialistic spirit of English rule cannot blend. 
What are the Englishman's " improvements," 
his railways and tanks and bridges, his five 
per cent, dividends even, to the mystical, mildly 
contemplative, apathetic Hindu, with his gaze 
fixed on Nirvana, and his scorn of the fleeting 
uses of a world that is to him an inn, a 

" batter'd Caravanserai 
Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day." 

And on the other hand, what can the bustling, 
huckstering, eye-on-the-main-chance English- 
man, to whom metaphysic is a fable and barom- 
eters and microscopes are "philosophical instru- 
ments,"* whose religion is largely a matter of 
seventh-day observances, make of a man whose 
life is all religion, all metaphysic, who, as our 
author tartly puts it, 

" Sits on his haunches at a railway station for a whole 
day meditating on the desirability of not being born 
again ! " 

Truly, here is a pair of hopeless " Incompat- 
ibles." Yet the Anglo-Indian, a mere drop in 
the ocean of latently-hostile native life about 
him, is apparently as unmindful of his position 
as he was up to the hour when the tragedy of 
'57 burst upon him, threatening to sweep him 
like thistle-down from the face of the land where 
(as we gather from our author) he snubs the 
natives socially, maltreats them officially, and, 
in short, fags and bullies his unresisting infe- 
riors in the good old John Bull way. Says 
Mr. Carpenter: 

"The most damning fact that I know against the 
average English attitude towards the natives is the 
fact that one of the very few places besides Aligarh, 
where there is any cordial feeling between the two 
parties, is Hyderabad a place in which, on account 
of its being under the Nizam, the officials are natives, 
and their position therefore prevents their being tram- 
pled on ! " 

Mr. Carpenter dwells with apprehension on the 
fact that there are indications of an awaken- 
ing sense of nationality, of a dawning con- 
sciousness of their own strength, among the 
natives. While they will have none of the re- 

* As Hegel notes with scorn in his Geschichte der Philos- 
ophic. 



ligion of their rulers, they profit by their polit- 
ical lessons. Prominent among the signs of 
the times is the National Indian Congress 
an annual assemblage which brings together 
from 1000 to 1500 delegates from all parts of 
India. 

" If the Congress movement is destined to become a 
great political movement, it must, it seems to me, even- 
tuate in one of two ways either in violence and civil 
war, owing to determined hostility on the part of our 
Government and the continual widening of the breach 
between the two peoples; or which is more likely, 
if our government grants more and more representative 
power to the people in the immense growth of polit- 
ical and constitutional life among them, and the gradual 
drowning out of British rule thereby." 

There are other possibilities, as our author 
points out ; but they all, he holds, " involve 
the decadence of our political power in India. 
... I can neither see nor imagine any other 
conclusion." 

From Mr. Carpenter's account of Caste we 
shall allow ourselves one extract just pre- 
mising that when one reads that the Brahmans 
alone are subdivided into 1886 separate classes, 
the fearful complexity of the system is dimly 
apparent. * 

" An acquaintance of mine in Ceylon who belongs to 
the Vellala caste told me that on one occasion he paid 
a visit to a friend of his in India who belonged to the 
same caste but to a different section of it. They had 
a Brahman cook, who prepared the food for both of 
them, but who, being of a higher caste, could not eat 
after them; while they could not eat together because 
they did not belong to the same section." 

Here was a problem to stagger the genius of a 
McAllister. But the Brahman cook rose to 
the emergency. He " ate his dinner first, and 
then served up the remainder separately to the 
two friends, who sat at different tables with a 
curtain hanging between them." 

In contrast to Mr. Carpenter's thoughtful 
book is Sara Jeannette Duncan's " The Sim- 
ple Adventures of a Memsahib." A " memsa- 
hib," we may say to those who have not read 
their Kipling, is a married woman more spe- 
cifically, we think, an English married woman. 
Our author has herself recently become a "mem- 
sahib "; and the present volume is essentially an 
account of the early house-keeping trials of an 
inexperienced young wife in Calcutta. The com 
plexities of house-furnishing, of the hiring and 
management of servants, of polyglot duels with 
the native shopmen (whose ways are decidedly 
not " the ways of righteousness "), etc., are de-

tailed in a sprightly, superficial style, with a 
sprinkling of the smallest of small talk, and 
with a rambling volubility slightly suggestive 
of Mrs. Nickleby. Incidentally, the reader is 
given a glimpse of Calcutta " society " and 
the glimpse is not a pleasing one. The vol- 
ume closes with the following picture of an 
evolved memsahib " graduated, sophisticated, 
qualified ": 

" She has lost her pretty color, that always goes 
first, and has gained a shadowy ring under each eye, 
that always comes afterwards. She is thinner than she 
was, and has acquired nerves and some petulance. . . . 
To make up, she dresses her hair more elaborately, and 
crowns it with a little bonnet which is somewhat ex- 
travagantly ' chic.' She has fallen into a way of cross- 
ing her knees in a low chair that would horrify her 
Aunt Plovtree, and a whole set of little feminine An- 
glo-Indian poses have come to her naturally. . . . 
Without being actually slangy, she takes the easiest 
word and the shortest cut in India we know only the 
necessities of speech, we do not really talk, even in the 
cold weather. . . . She is growing dull to India, too, 
which is about as sad a thing as any. She has ac- 
quired for the Aryan inhabitant a certain strong irri- 
tation, and she believes him to be nasty in all his ways. 
This will sum up her impressions of India years hence 
as completely as it does to-day. She is a memsahib 
like another." 

The book is very amusing, and offers a fresh 
disproof of the notion (started, probably, by 
some author of an unappreciated joke) that wo- 
men lack the sense of humor. Miss Duncan 
is at times nearly as good as " Mark Twain."

" Eastward to the Land of the Morning," 
by M. M. Shoemaker, is the pleasantly writ- 
ten record of " a happy winter under sunny

course of his globe-girdling trip the author 
saw something of Egypt and China, and more 
of India and Japan ; and he tells the story in 
an easy, unaffected way, and with an abstention 
from citing the " capitol building at Colum- 
bus " as the architectural standard, that, in an 
Ohio man, is rather remarkable. Among the 
notable people met by Mr. Shoemaker was an 
Anglo-Indian judge who asked " whether each 
and every railroad in America does not own 
its own judge, before whom all cases in which 
said road is concerned are tried, and who al- 
ways decides in its favor." Mr. Shoemaker 
was about to give the " reply valiant "; but re- 
flecting that perhaps the judge had "heard 
something of the government of the city of 
New York, and gotten it mixed up with the 

country at large," he desisted.

THE 



WITCHCRAFT.* 



Dr. Ernest Hart, well known to students of 
psychology, has written a timely work on " Hyp- 
notism, Mesmerism, and the New Witchcraft." 
The tendency of this very readable volume is 
admirable ; while recognizing the demonstrable 
and physiological phenomena of hypnotism, it 
opposes most vigorously and effectively the 
extravagant notions and pseudo-experiments 
which, in the name of hypnotic science, have 
been launched with much ceremony upon the 
reading public. This protest is especially time- 
ly, as the recent popular interest in hypnotism 
has been sustained and fostered distinctly more 
by the promises of demonstration of superna- 
tural effects than by an intelligent understand- 
ing of the specially psychological and scientific 
problems involved. 

Dr. Hart devotes the most of his space to 
the consideration of the views and experiments 
of Dr. Luys at the hospital of La Charite in 
Paris. Dr. Luys's subjects claim to be sensi- 
tive to the action of a magnet, one pole attract- 
ing them and causing pleasant visions, while 
the other repels and gives rise to distressing 
emotions. Another specialty of these subjects 
is the externalization of sensation. The sub- 
ject becomes en rapport with an inanimate ob- 
ject. The favorite object is a doll that has 
been acted upon to secure the rapport; if the 
doll be pinched, the subject feels the pain in 
the corresponding place. Dr. Luys even has 
a skull-cap which, when placed upon the head 
of the subject, produces in her the somewhat 
incoherent mental notions of its former pos- 
sessor. These fantastic theories and observa- 
tions Dr. Hart has most patiently refuted by a 
series of control experiments. With the aid 
of an electro-magnet it was clearly shown that 
the alleged effects appeared as readily when 
the current was off as when it was on, and 
always in response to a suggestion. When one 
thing was said while in reality the opposite 
was done by Dr. Hart, the verbal suggestion 
was obeyed ; a false doll, not acted upon, ef- 
fected the alleged transfer of sensation quite 
as well as the true one. The following is a 
summary of some of the more interesting of 
the doll and magnet experiments : 

" I had prepared an electro-magnet of considerable 
power, from which the current could be turned on or off 
with great rapidity by touching a button or by lifting 
the plates from the bath, or of course by detaching one 
or the other of the wires. I had also a bar of iron

resembling the magnetised bar which M. Luys had used, 
but which was not magnetic, a demagnetised magnet, 
and a set of needles variously and inversely magnetised. 
I had also two exactly similar wax dolls brought from a 
toy shop. ... I signalled to the assistant, and told him 
to put on the current, whereupon he turned it off. Ac- 
customed, however, to believe that a magnet must be a 
magnet, Marguerite began to handle it. The note taken 
by Dr. Sajous runs thus: 'She found the north pole, 
notwithstanding there was no current, very pretty; she 
was, as it were, fascinated by it; she caressed the blue 
flames, and showed every sign of delight. Then came 
the phenomena of attraction. She followed the magnet 
with delight across the room, as though fascinated by 
it. The bar was turned so as to present the other end, 
or what would be called, in the language of La Charite", 
the south pole; then she fell into the attitude of repul- 
sion and horror, with clenched fists, and as it approached 
her she fell backward into the arms of M. Cremiere, 
and was carried, still showing all the signs of terror and 
repulsion, back to her chair.' . . . Similar but false 
phenomena were obtained in succession with all the 
different forms of magnet and non-magnet. Marguerite 
was never once right; but throughout, her acting was 
perfect; she was utterly unable at any time really to dis- 
tinguish between a plain bar of iron, a demagnetised 
magnet, or a horse-shoe magnet carrying a full current, 
and one from which the current was wholly cut off. 

" We took one of the dolls. We restored Marguerite 
to the perfectly hypnotised condition, and when she was 
profoundly plunged in the state which is described as 
profound hypnosis, I placed a doll in her hand, which 
she held long enough to sensitise it. I then, taking the 
doll from her, rapidly disposed of it behind some books, 
and proceeded to operate on another doll which she 
had not touched and which I had just taken out of 
the box in which it came from the toy-shop. Holding 
her hand, I placed her in contact with Dr. Sajous, that 
he might also be, to use the jargon of the school, en 
rapport with her, and I continued to hold her hand. 
If now I touched the hair of the doll, which she was sup- 
posed not to see, she exclaimed, according to my notes, 
' On touche les cheveux,' < On les tire,' ' They are 
touching my hair they are pulling it,' and as she 
complained it hurt her, we had to leave off pulling the 
doll's hair. Taking the doll to a little distance, I 
pinched it; she showed every sign of pain, and cried out, 
' I don't like to be hurt je ne veux pas qu' on me fasse 
de mal.' I tickled the cheek of the figure; she began 
to smile pleasantly." 

The supposed action of drugs at a distance 
proved to depend for its success upon delicate 
and unconscious suggestion. 

" I put away the witness dolls, and we then proceeded 
to the effects of medicine tubes applied to the skin. 
I took a tube which was supposed to contain alcohol, but 
which did contain cherry laurel water. She immedi- 
ately began, to use the words of M. Sajous's notes, to 
smile agreeably and then to laugh; she became gay. 
' It makes me laugh,' she said ; and then, ' I'm not 
tipsy, I want to sing,' and so on through the whole 
performance of a not ungraceful griserie, which we 
stopped at that stage, for I was loth to have the degrading 
performance of drunkenness carried to the extreme I 
had seen her go through at the Charite". I now applied 
a tube of alcohol, asking the assistant, however, to give 
me valerian, which no doubt this profoundly hypnotised 



subject perfectly well heard, for she immediately went 
through the whole cat performance I have already de- 
scribed as having been performed for my delectation by 
Mervel, under the hands of Dr. Luys, on the previous 
day. She spat, she scratched, she mewed, she leaped 
about on all fours, and she was as thoroughly cat-like 
as was Mervel on the previous and Jeanne on the sub- 
sequent day. It would be tedious to go through the 
whole of the notes of the numerous sittings which I had 
with these five subjects, but I may say at once that we 
had the cat performance six times, twice with Jeanne, 
twice with Vix, once with Clarice, and once with Mervel. 
In no case by any accident was valerian used, but either 
sugar, alcohol, diabetic svigar, cherry laurel water, or 
distilled water ; nevertheless, the performance never 
failed when the subjects had reason to think it was ex- 
pected of them." 

In brief, we have here recorded another in- 
stance of a man of reputation being deceived 
by a shrewd anticipation of his unexpressed 
theories. It is certainly most unfortunate that 
experiments of this type have become identified 
with hypnotism, and it is to be hoped that this 
volume will contribute to a clearer perspective 
of the value of such research and a more whole- 
some direction of interest in phenomena of this 
kind. 

The one criticism that most students of hyp- 
notism would pass upon Dr. Hart's views is 
that he undervalues the work done by the Nancy 
school, and the application of hypnotism to 
medical practice. There is undoubtedly occa- 
sion for divergence of opinion on these points, 
but a somewhat more prominent and emphatic 
statement of the real contribution to the sub- 
ject would perhaps have been serviceable in 
preventing the notion, which a hasty reader 
might form, that all hypnotic research is value- 
less. But the provocation for a destructive 
criticism of certain studies in hypnotism has 
been so ample that a little overstatement is but 
natural. JOSEPH JASTROW. 



AUSTRALIAN BUILDER.* 

The eyes of the financial world are at pres- 
ent fixed on Australia, which has seen its credit 
shaken to the centre by the crash of its bank- 
ing system. This catastrophe seems, however, 
but a phase of the " storm and stress " period of 
growth through which all young states must 
inevitably come to a maturer, safer, and hon- 
ester life, and carries American memories back 
to the days of state banking and " wildcat " 
money. At such a time especial interest at-

taches to a book which is an autobiographic 
record of a half-century of public life in the 
leading Australian colony, written by the chief 
maker of Australian history probably the one 
politician of that new world who is as largely 
known to the American public as is Frank Sla- 
vin or Peter Jackson. For nearly forty years, 
as Henry Parkes or Sir Henry Parkes, he was 
a member of the Parliament of New South 
Wales, and was five times at the head of a lib- 
eral ministry. No more fascinating book than 
his has been published in recent times. The 
octogenarian statesman writes with the same 
audacious faith in himself which has always 
characterized his forty years of stormy polit- 
ical leadership, and gives blows with as sturdy 
a good-will as when he held command. 

One must not look here for a cool historical 
account of affairs in New South Wales. He 
must always remember that there is another 
side ; but Mr. Francis in the " Fortnightly Re- 
view," the special correspondent of the London 
" Times " for 1893, and Sir Charles Dilke in 
his " Problems of Greater Britain " may all 
help to keep that in sight for the impartial ob- 
server. What one does find here is a wealth 
of details of political affairs in Australia to be 
read of nowhere else, and such an introduction 
to the personality of Australian governing cir- 
cles as can be given, probably, by no other pen. 
These pages, for their field, are as good as 
Mozley's Reminiscences, or Greville's Memoirs, 
or the Journal of Lord Loftus. Here, mingled 
with interesting reminiscences of Browning 
and Tennyson, Cobden and Bright, President 
Arthur and General Grant, are delightful let- 
ters from Carlyle and Florence Nightingale, 
sandwiched in with others of the highest im- 
portance with reference to constitutional law 
from authorities so eminent as Alpheus Todd, 
Sir T. Erskine May, Sir Arthur Helps, Lord 
Grey of Howick. But, better still, we are here 
introduced to Australian life in its infancy, 
and see it grow to a giant strength as it unfolds 
around this Homeric figure. From the deck 
of an emigrant ship we catch with him our first 
glimpse of Australia in 1839, seventeen years 
before the advent of responsible government, 
when New South Wales had little more than 
a hundred thousand of colonists and nearly 
one-third of these were transported convicts. 
Then it was known to the outer world almost 
solely as the purlieus of Botany Bay. With 
this still hale old man we see it set off, to the 
north and to the south, its two younger colo- 
nies ; and then come to have within its own 



borders a million of freemen, the majority of 
whom annually produce the largest wool crop 
in the world, while thousands of others are en- 
gaged with the product of the most prolific 
of silver mines. Sidney wool is as famous for 
its quality as is the Proprietary Mine at Broken 
Hill for its quantity. 

Young in experience as Australia is, it has 
already given to the older world of its anti- 
podes the Torrens land registry system, the 
secret ballot, the closure, and the practical ap- 
plication of the eight-hour day. But not only 
in its suggestiveness to American politics is 
this newer Australian life of interest to us. 
This record by Sir Henry Parkes is a record 
of the working out on parallel lines of many 
problems kindred to our own, and this fre- 
quently under the influence of our own national 
history. Among the most important questions 
are those of immigration, the tariff, and the 
disposal of public lands. The immigration 
controversy in Australia has gone through 
three stages, according as its subject has been 
the convict, the Chinaman, or the Kanaka. 
In his early days Henry Parkes did good ser- 
vice, alongside the afterwards famous Robert 
Lowe, and that pioneer Australian, William 
Charles Wentworth, in putting an end to the 
convict supply. In 1881, and again in 1888, 
he was largely instrumental in the passage of 
Chinese restriction acts curiously synchron- 
ous with our own exclusion legislation. Con- 
sistently with his record, he took only last year 
the same attitude in regard to the importation 
of South Sea Islanders, as an element detri- 
mental to the body politic. So in his earlier 
years, when the experiment of " assisted " im- 
migration from the sturdy working classes of 
Great Britain and Ireland was being tried, he 
was strenuous for a proportion which should 
keep Saxon blood always to the fore. A homo- 
geneous self -controlled community has ever 
been his aim for the Australias. Again, along 
with Sir John Robertson, he fought for years 
the battle of the humbler settler against the 
"shepherd kings," the farmsteading against 
the ranche, until some approach to equal- 
ity of opportunity was at length obtained for 
the intending agriculturist. Again and again 
is reference found to our own system of land 
entry so far, more favorable to the home- 
steader. In the matter of the tariff, Parkes 
has always been a stanch free-trader, and with 
an interim of eight or nine years he has led the 
sentiment of his colony. In 1865, however, 
and the date is interesting from a telepathic

point of view, New South Wales adopted a 
protective tariff. In 1873 the free-traders re- 
turned to control ; but only two years ago Sir 
Henry's last ministry was defeated through a 
coalition of the protectionists and the labor 
group, and in the spring of last year Mr. 
Dibbs's ministry reverted to protection. To- 
day, nevertheless, public sentiment in the col- 
ony, as with us, trembles in the balance. 

It is interesting to see, in all these Austra- 
lian colonies, a generous pride in the associa- 
tion with Great Britain go hand-in-hand with 
a large-minded jealousy of anything like im- 
perial interference in their affairs. By the 
aid of this local independence, Sir Henry has 
not yet succeeded in getting rid of the nomi- 
nee members of the upper house of the legis- 
lature, for whom his memoirs express scant re- 
spect. But it was during his first ministry 
that the imperial government in 1874 
virtually conceded to the colonial ministry the 
full control of the pardoning power ; and his 
government, backed by the legislature, by res- 
olution and protest most heartily cooperated 
with Queensland in 1888 in her successful op- 
position to the appointment of a governor who 
was persona ingrata to a large section of her 
population. Only the other day, in deference 
to this sentiment, the imperial authorities noti- 
fied the government of New South Wales of 
their desire to appoint Sir R. W. Duff to suc- 
ceed the retiring governor. The same spirit 
is manifest in the discussion of Australian 
as distinct from and even opposed to impe- 
rial federation, and is brought out in the cor- 
respondence in 1889 between Parkes and Dun- 
can Gillies, the premier of Victoria. Sir Henry 
Parkes's name has been largely identified with 
this movement toward Australasian federation, 
although his own colony has held somewhat 
aloof until the trend as to some of the matters 
of detail shall be more clearly defined. When 
that much- to-be-desired union shall take place, 
the Australias will find some of the problems 
of an upper house, over which Sir Henry has 
spent much thought, capable of an easier solu- 
tion. 

The author's visits to the United States and 
England are interesting episodes in his agree- 
able narrative. His account of General Grant, 
who, at a dining, " spoke for six or seven min- 
utes with quiet fluency, and in clear finely-cut 
sentences of common-sense," was well worth re- 
cording. His mention of Governor Carnell of 
New York, whom he met more than once in the 
beginning of 1882, makes one rub his eyes for 



a moment, till he discovers Governor Cornell. 
Funny is Parkes's reply, in 1853, to a speaker 
who challenged the patriotism of the makers 
of our Constitution by the criticism that their 
work was done behind closed doors. " To a 
certain extent it might be true," is the rejoin- 
der, " that the delegates sat with closed doors, 
for as it was cold in America, they probably 
did not leave them open." Curious is it, too, 
to read from the speech of one of the delegates 
to the Federation Conference of 1890, as quoted 
approvingly by Parkes, that " the Federal Par- 
liament ought to be empowered to cut up the 
larger colonies into smaller colonies, as the 
Federal Government of America has cut up 
the larger States into smaller States when it 
has been deemed expedient and just to do so." 
Is this a generous induction from the solitary 
case of West Virginia? Inter arma silent leges. 
Many other portions of this prolonged and 
useful career might be dwelt upon such as 
Sir Henry Parkes's agency in opening up the 
trans-Pacific Ocean route in connection with 
our first continental railway, his admirable sys- 
tem of public-school education, his local-option 
treatment of the liquor traffic, his industrial 
schools and hospital system. But enough has 
been said to induce to the reading of a most 
instructive volume, where, if the author has in 
truth written himself somewhat large, he has 
done it with that naive and unconscious sim- 
plicity of egoism which is charming because it 
is the product only of heroic epochs of the 
juventus mundi. J OHN j. HALSET. 



ENGLISH PROSE LITERATURE.* 



Among selections from English poets, no 
collection is at present more widely known or 
more frequently used than Ward's " English 
Poets." The main feature of that work, apart 
from its careful selection of characteristic poems 
from various writers, was the concise critical 
introduction accompanying each author. Many 
of these were models of their kind, written as 
they were by various eminent critics chosen 
with special reference to the poet treated. The 
volume of Craik's " English Prose " now be- 
fore us, together with the three that are to 
follow it, are to furnish for English prose 
what Ward's Poets furnishes for English poe- 
try ; that is, short typical selections from the 
majority of English prose writers since the

middle of the fourteenth century. We find 
here the same critical introductions by emi- 
nent English critics, preceded by concise state- 
ments of the facts in the lives of the writers 
and followed by short selections from their 
works. 

The plan of the work would therefore seem 
to be without fault, and such a future useful- 
ness might apparently be predicted for it as 
the companion series has already had. Yet 
there is one essential difference between selec- 
tions from poetry and from prose. It is always 
possible in the case of poetry to select com- 
plete pieces which shall do ample justice to the 
merits of a poet, or even to choose passages 
from longer works that, because of some strik- 
ing description or episode, have a complete- 
ness in themselves. This is far from true of 
prose. It is not possible in the compass of 
such a volume as the present, giving extracts 
from the prose authors of two centuries, to 
print a single complete prose work, even a 
monograph or pamphlet ; while the nature of 
prose does not make it easy to select any short 
passage fully exemplifying the style of a prose 
writer. This depends on the fact that poetry 
is always a more concise form of expression 
than prose, and its flavor, so to speak, may be 
more easily perceived from a taste or two. In 
reality it would take twenty volumes of prose 
to give such a view of growth and development 
in English as might be given in a single vol- 
ume of poetry. For this reason, although it is 
inherent in the nature of poetry and prose and 
so not under the control of editor or critic, the 
volumes before us must inevitably suffer in 
comparison with the corresponding series. 

One other point deserves mention. The ed- 
itor of a volume of selections is most likely to 
err through including too many authors. Most 
of the collectors of prose have been especially 
liable to this criticism, and our editor is no ex- 
ception to the rule. For example, there are 
about forty poets in the first volume of Ward, 
ending with Donne, who died in 1631. In 
this first volume of English prose there are 
fifty-one for practically the same period. Had 
the number of authors been fewer, the selec- 
tions from the more important ones might have 
been longer and better. Moreover, this fact 
is especially emphasized when we compare the 
relative development of English poetry and 
prose. Modern poetry begins with Chaucer, 
and its second great exemplar died before 1600. 
Modern prose of equal importance scarcely 
begins before Milton and Dryden, neither of 



whom belongs to the present volume. Not- 
withstanding these criticisms, we gladly wel- 
come this important contribution to the history 
of English prose, and we shall look with inter- 
est for the later volumes, which will cover the 
more interesting periods of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. 

As in Ward's Poets, the critical introduc- 
tion to the prose writers are particularly inter- 
esting and valuable. Some of these are writ- 
ten by Saintsbury, Hales, Collins, Ainger, 
Ward, and Gosse, besides the editor himself. 
The introduction to the whole volume is by Mr. 
W. P. Ker, whose name also follows the largest 
number of critical notices. As to the former, 
one feels that scant justice is done to the ear- 
liest prose in the times of the great literary re- 
vivals under Alfred and JElfric, compared with 
the later prose under Chaucer. For it may 
certainly be said that the best prose of the pe- 
riods of Alfred and ^Elfric is stronger and 
clearer than much of that written in the Mid- 
dle English period. Nor is it clearly set forth 
that the relation between the prose of Alfred 
and the prose of Mandeville is a much more 
natural one than would be supposed from the 
exaggerated estimates of the influence of the 
Norman conquest. This is largely due to the 
fact that the English literary critic knows so 
little of the older period, and hence is not able 
to judge of what is original and what is ac- 
quired. 

Occasional points that might be improved 
occur in the critical notices preceding the se- 
lections from various authors. We might have 
a more exact statement as to the origin of 
Mandeville's travels, and some mention might 
have been made of Schbnborn's important mon- 
ograph. Again, we have an occasional false 
note, as in the notice of Cranmer, where Mr. 
Collins has the following: 

" He adjusted with exquisite tact and skill the Saxon 
and Latin elements in our language, both in the ser- 
vice of rhythm and in the service of expression. He 
saw that the power of the first lay in terseness and 
sweetness, the power of the second in massiveness and 
dignity, and that he who could succeed in tempering 
artfully and with propriety the one by the other would 
be in the possession of an instrument which Isocrates 
and Cicero might envy. He saw, too, the immense ad- 
vantage which the coexistence of these elements af- 
forded for rhetorical emphasis. And this accounts for 
one of the distinctive features of the diction of our lit- 
urgy, the habitual association of Saxon words with their 
Latin synonyms for purposes of rhetorical emphasis." 

Now there need be no hesitation in saying that 
this goes much too far with regard to Cranmer 
or anyone else. In fact, one may assert, with- 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



out fear of successful refutation, that no writer 
of any age consciously chooses his words from 
the Saxon and Latin or any other elements. 
What he does do is to choose from his own vo- 
cabulary, however required, words that seem 
to him strong or forcible, clear or concise, me- 
lodious or rhythmical, with little if any thought 
and often no knowledge of ultimate origin. 
One might as reasonably suppose the painter 
chooses his colors with some knowledge of their 
chemical composition, rather than because of 
their power to produce certain color effects. 
Moreover, an examination of the English Lit- 
urgy shows that the statement as to " habitual 
association," etc., is exaggerated and incorrect, 
although it has been so often repeated as to 
have apparently established itself. 

While noting these points of disagreement 
with the work before us, we have already ex- 
pressed a belief in its careful preparation and 
in its usefulness. These critical comments are 
added with the hope that they may be of bene- 
fit to those who use the book, not in any sense 
that they may prevent its use. It is to be hoped 
also that this new series of selections will stimu- 
late the study of English prose, which, compared 
with poetry, has been sadly neglected in the 
schools and we fear too often by English read- 



ers.

glish classics published by Messrs. 
J. M. Dent & Co. (Macmillan). Few reprints of 
recent years have been as welcome as the Landor, 
Peacock, and Jane Austen, for which we are in- 
debted to these publishers. The convenient form 
of the volumes, the taste displayed in their typog- 
raphy, binding, and illustration, are features which 
must commend these editions to a wide circle of 
book-lovers ; while their inexpensiveness puts them 
within the reach of thousands to whom editions de 
luxe, in the ordinary sense, are inaccessible. The 
publishers of these books are now producing, in 
similar shape, editions of the Bronte sisters and of 
the works of Fielding. The former of these edi- 
tions has already been mentioned in these pages, 
and we have now only to note the appearance of 
the " Villette," which, like the " Jane Eyre " and 
the " Shirley," fills two of the pretty volumes. The 
edition of Fielding has just been started with " Jos- 
eph Andrews," in two volumes. It will be followed 
by "Tom Jones," "Amelia," "Jonathan Wild," 
and two volumes of Fielding's miscellaneous writ- 
ings twelve volumes in all, the whole under the 



editorship of Mr. George Saintsbury. The illus- 
trations, of which each volume is to have three or 
four, are the work of Mr. Herbert Railton and Mr. 
E. J. Wheeler. Mr. Saintsbury is to furnish each 
work with an introduction, and the prefatory chap- 
ter thus provided for " Joseph Andrews " is in the 
happiest manner (or mannerism) of that accom- 
plished critic. Mr. Saintsbury considers " Joseph 
Andrews " as having fceen suggested by the " Pay- 
san Parvenu " of Marivaux quite as much as by 
Richardson's " Pamela," which is perhaps stretch- 
ing a point. But Mr. Saintsbury is always thought- 
provoking, and nowhere more so than in his too 
brief introduction to the present volumes. 

Herr Ziehen's "Introduction to the 

A fanciful scheme -i -i- 

for the study of Study of Physiological Psychology 

(Macmillan) is a clear presentation 
of the outlines of the science from the point of view 
of the reaction against Herr Wundt, of which Herr 
Miinsterberg is the best-known leader. All the 
ultimate problems of psychology are relegated to 
epistemology, or to a possible science of meta- 
physics, "supposing it to exist"; and then every- 
thing else is made perfectly simple by means of 
neat little diagrams illustrating the origin, trans- 
formations, and associations of ideas in the brain. 
The diagrams are purely schematic and problem- 
atical. The hypothesis, for example, that pervades 
them all, of locally distinct sensory and memory 
cells, is by no means generally accepted by special- 
ists. But even a hypothetical anatomical scheme, 
the author contends, is of use as demonstrating the 
a priori possibility of his method, and relieving us 
of the " fear " of being compelled to have recourse 
to apperception, or will, or synthetic unity of con- 
sciousness, or some other mystic higher faculty. His 
schemes, he assures us, can all be easily readjusted 
as science progresses, and, whatever alterations be- 
come necessary, " the fundamental conception that all 
processes of thought can be reduced psychologic- 
ally to the association of ideas will at all events en- 
dure." Into the merits of the controversy with Herr 
Wundt it is impossible to enter here. Suffice it to 
say that he does not really break the continuity 
of mental development by the assumption of new 
mystic faculties of apperception, judgment, and will. 
Under these varying names he endeavors rather to 
trace throughout psychic life the fundamental uni- 
fying activity which the young psychologists in part 
dissimulate and in part relegate to epistemology. 
He attacks wherever he finds them the ultimate 
metaphysical problems which they evade and post- 
pone. To determine whether this means more than 
a difference of method or exposition would require 
a much more elaborate dialectic than either side has 
yet brought to bear upon the controversy. In any 
case, the present brief intelligible exposition of one 
view of the matter is welcome. The translation, 
by Mr. C. C. Van Liew and Dr. Otto W. Beyer, is 
substantially correct, but stiff, inelegant, and con- 
taminated with German idiom.

Mr. Maine's 
literary essays, 



Mr. H. W. Mabie's " Essays in Lit- 
erary Interpretation " ( Dodd) are 
eight in number, and are character- 
ized by sanity, grace, and the philosophic temper. 
Two of them set forth the complexity of modern lit- 
ei*ature and the irreducible personal element which, 
in all great work, baffles the academic critic. A 
third discusses criticism itself, for the purpose of 
emphasizing the significant aspects of the art in its 
modern development. The critic has mainly to do 
with " the men whose inferiority to Homer and 
Dante, to Shakespeare and Milton, is clearly appar- 
ent," says Mr. Mabie. This is, of course, true, but 
we fail to understand to whom the succeeding sen- 
tence refers : " These illustrious shades have re- 
ceived but a single comrade into their immortal fel- 
lowship during the present century." Is it Goethe 
or Shelley or Hugo or Tennyson ? Competent opin- 
ion declares for each or all of these names, and Mr. 
Mabie should have specified, although later passages 
make it probable that Goethe is meant. According 
to Mr. Mabie, plasticity and the historical method 
give to modern criticism its distinctive character. 
Four of these essays are studies of as many poets 
Rossetti, Browning, Keats, and Dante. They well 
illustrate the author's own views of modern criti- 
cism, for each displays the special quality of sym- 
pathy that its subject calls for, and each takes ade- 
quate account of the poet's environment. The essay 
on Rossetti has one or two slips: 1876, instead of 
1870, is given as the date of Rossetti's " Poems," 
and " The Bride's Prelude " is omitted from the 
enumeration of his ballads.

A sympathetic 
biography of 
Dr. John Brown. 



The " Recollections of Dr. John 
Brown " (Scribner), which are given 
us, with a selection from Brown's 
correspondence, by Dr. Alexander Peddie, afford a 
sketch, rather than a finished portrait, of the genial 
historian of " Rab " and " Marjorie Fleming." The 
author was intimately acquainted with Brown, whom 
he calls " my revered master and nearly lifelong 
friend," and his book is sympathetic, if fragment- 
ary. It keeps us constantly in mind of the fact 
that Brown was primarily a man of medicine, and 
but secondarily a man of letters that his literary 
recreations were indeed, as their title indicates, 
products of his " Horse Subsecivae," rather than the 
serious work of his life. In fact, his appearance 
in literature was rather accidental, resulting from 
Hugh Miller's invitation to contribute to the " Wit- 
ness" some notices of the pictures in the Scottish 
Academy exhibition of 1846. His first thought 
was to decline the request (which was accompanied 
by a bank note), "had not my sine qud non, with 
wife-like government, retentive and peremptory, 
kept the money and heartened me." The book has 
a number of interesting illustrations, which include 
portraits and facsimile letters, the latter ornamented 
with rough drawings. Brown reminds one not a 
little, in character and originality, of the late Ed- 
ward FitzGerald, and this impression is strength- 



A ^factory Sir Arthur Gordon's The Earl of 
biography of the Aberdeen" ("The Queen's Prime 
een ' Ministers," Harper) is a satisfactory 
piece of biography, considering the narrow compass 
to which the volumes of the series are confined. 
The delineation of so finely shaded a character 
would not, in any circumstances, be an easy task; 
and the fact that Lord Aberdeen's public, like his 
private life, was, generally speaking, comparatively 
hidden, renders it still more difficult. His pre- 
miership shows none of the histrionic climaxes and 
situations that mark that of a Disraeli. There was 
little in his public career to dazzle the spectator, or 
to command instant or excessive admiration ; and 
neither his mental powers nor rare personal charm 
can now be fairly appreciated, except by those who, 
like the author of this book, lived in close personal 
intercourse with him, and have had access to the 
mass of his correspondence, public and private. The 
author is to be especially commended, in view of 
his relationship to Lord Aberdeen, for the tact and 
sobriety of judgment everywhere manifest in his 
work. : 

A very valuable addition to the " In- 

Greek and Latin tern ational Scientific Series " ( Ap- 

Palceography. . , , <r TT j

book of Greek and Latin Palaeography," by Dr. 
Edward Maunde Thompson, of the British Mu- 
seum. Photography has done so much in recent 
years for the study of palaeography that the sub- 
ject is practically brought within the reach of any 
who care to take it up. To such this book is ad- 
dressed. It gives us a history of the Greek and 
Latin alphabets, an account of the materials used 
to receive writing, chapters on writing instruments, 
the forms of books, and abbreviations, and, finally, 
an extended history of the development of Greek 
and Latin writing, with many facsimile illustrations 
from the earliest to the latest periods. The work is 
singularly compact, and provides a satisfactory in- 
troduction to the study of its important subject. 

" A Pathfinder in American His- 
&$$ tory " ( Lee & Shepard ), by Messrs.

one of those useful, or rather indispensable, books 
for teachers that recent years have so greatly mul- 
tiplied. It suggests methods of instruction for all 
grades, including the youngest ; it outlines the treat- 
ment of selected typical subjects ; it gives extensive 
lists of books for reference and for supplementary 
reading. The references, which are in most cases 
not merely to the book, but to chapter and page, 
will be found extremely helpful by students and 
teachers alike, while they represent, on the part of 
the authors, many years of reading and. investiga- 
tion. We give the book a hearty welcome, and pre- 
dict for it a long career of usefulness.

The Bancroft Company send us the 
first installment of their Book of 
the Fair, a forty-page folio, to be 
followed by twenty-four similar semi-monthly parts. 
The complete work will thus make a folio volume 
of a thousand pages, and these will be adorned, we 
are told, by more than three thousand illustrations. 
The part now published contains a chapter on 
" Fairs of the Past," a historical sketch of Chicago, 
and the beginning of a chapter on " The Evolution 
of the Columbian Exposition." Mr. Hubert Howe 
Bancroft is the writer of the text, and is peculiarly 
competent to deal with so large a subject, although 
his style occasionally suffers from magniloquence. 
Paper, print, and illustrations are very satisfactory. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



MR. Arnold H. Heinemann has edited a selection of 
Froebel's letters (Lee & Shepard), not printed hereto- 
fore, and now reproduced in a very free sort of trans- 
lation or paraphrase. The publication is sanctioned by 
Frau Froebel, who is still living which may be news to 
some at the age of seventy-eight. The editor con- 
tributes some notes to the work, and a certain amount 
of comment upon Froebel's theories of education. The 
book will be welcome to kiudergartners, and, indeed, 
to all who are concerned in the education of children. 

OUR veteran lepidopterist, Mr. Samuel H. Scudder, 
has recently prepared two books about butterflies that 
will be found very helpful to youthful readers and stu- 
dents. One of them, " The Life of a Butterfly," takes 
a single species (Anosia plexippus) for a text, and dis- 
courses upon the structure, habits, and life-histories of 
butterflies in general. The other book is a little more 
pretentious, being a "Brief Guide to the Commoner 
Butterflies of the Northern United States and Canada." 
It classifies the common species, to the number of about 
a hundred, giving their life-histories, and provides ana- 
lytical keys, suggestions for reading, and directions for 
field and cabinet work. It is in every respect an ad- 
mirable little book, and ought to have a wide circula- 
tion. Both volumes are published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. 

" THE Making of a Newspaper " (Putnam) is a 
scrappy book, edited by Mr. Melville Philips, and con- 
sisting of a dozen or more articles upon various phases 
of newspaper production. It is intended " to afford the 
public a close and comprehensive view of various phases 
of newspaper life and work." While the view thus 
afforded is undeniably " close," we can hardly say that 
it is "comprehensive," for it is illustrated with too much 
of anecdote and random comment to leave room for the 
desirable amount of exact description. 

PROFESSOR T. F. Tout's Edward the First " (Mac- 
millan) almost completes the series of " Twelve En- 
glish Statesmen," but one volume Mr. Morley's "Chat- 
ham" remaining to be published. Professor Tout 
gives us a straightforward narrative of the reign of the 
great statesman-king. His work, while not brilliant, is 
perspicuous and scholarly, and comes quite up to the 
high general average of the series within which it is 
comprised. 

DR. James Dwight's little book on " Practical Lawn- 
Tennis " (Harper) is full of suggestions by which even 



an experienced player may profit, while for the begin- 
ner it affords all the necessary directions and rules. 
The most interesting feature of the book, however, is 
found in the illustrations, from instantaneous photo- 
graphs by Mr. Francis Blake, which represent the ten- 
nis player in a great variety of typical positions. So 
brief has been the exposure given these photographs, 
that the ball is defined with perfect sharpness, although 
in many cases it is just leaving the bat. 

A VOLUME of " Other Essays from the Easy Chair " 
(Harper) affords pleasant desultory reading. The es- 
says chosen range over many subjects, from nominating 
conventions to the idiosyncrasies of the hog family, and 
include semi-biographical studies of Emerson, Beecher, 
and Sherman. Some of the selections date back many 
years, as we discovered when we came upon the state- 
ment that Vice-Presidents of the United States have 
thrice succeeded to the Presidential chair. Either the 
essays should have been dated, or editorial care should 
have seen to the correction of such statements. 

THE Rev. Thomas R. R. Stebbing contributes " A 
History of Crustacea " to the " International Scientific 
Series" (Appleton). This title is misleading, for the 
reason that the work covers only a part of the ground 
indicated, having little to say about Entomostraca and 
Cirripedia. As far as the ground is covered, the book 
offers a compact and well illustrated manual of its sub- 
ject, useful both to the beginner and the advanced stu- 
dent. 

SOME recent studies in biography deserve a word of 
favorable mention. Dr. George H. Clark's " Oliver 
Cromwell " (Lothrop) is a popular account of its sub- 
ject, excellent as far as it goes, and, of course, compet- 
ing with Mr. Paxton Hood rather than with Carlyle. 
Miss Edith Carpenter has drawn an attractive " histor- 
ical portrait " of " Lorenzo de' Medici " (Putnam), which 
appears in a pretty little volume. " General Greene," 
by Mr. Francis Vinton Greene, is a new volume in the 
" Great Commanders " series (Appleton). Among the 
" Makers of America " (Dodd), we now have enrolled 
" Peter Stuyvesant," by Mr. Bayard Tuckerman, and 
" Thomas Jefferson," by Dr. James Schouler. 

A NEW series of pocketable volumes, the " Distaff," 
just begun by Messrs. Harper & Brothers, already in- 
cludes " Woman and the Higher Education," edited by 
Miss Anna C. Brackett, and " The ^Literature of Phi- 
lanthropy," edited by Miss Frances A. Goodale. Both 
are collections of essays, by women writers of the State 
of New York, selected from the periodicals of the cen- 
tury. The series is designed as a sort of appendix to 
the New York exhibit of woman's work in the Woman's 
Building at the World's Fair. 

"OUT of Doors in Tsarland " (Longmans), by Mr. F. 
J. Whishaw, is a book on Russia, " in whose pages, from 
beginning to end, no reference is made to Russia's Mis- 
sion in the East, or Peter the Great's Will, no allusion 
to Nihilists, and no mention whatever of Siberia." In- 
stead of these instructive themes, the writer has chosen 
to discourse upon street scenes and village manners, 
upon the snipe and the capercailzie, and upon the for- 
tunes of the angler and the bear-hunter. The book is 
as entertaining as it is unpretentious, and will appeal 
strongly to all lovers of out-door life. 

ANYONE who fancies that the Talmud is dry reading 
may be referred to a little book recently published by 
Dr. Abram S. Isaacs, and called " Stories from the 
Rabbis " (Webster). The author has retold the stories,

THE DIAL

it is true, and made them more attractive than in their 
original form, but it is interesting to know that the Tal- 
mud has its Faust story, and its Rip Van Winkle, and 
its Baron Munchansen. This " modest sheaf of arrows 
from the rabbinical quiver " is aimed at the general, 
and particularly the young, reader, who will find the 
collection deserving of attention. 

" THE Philosophy of Singing " (Harper), by Mrs. 
Clara Kathleen Rogers, is a little book that conveys 
much excellent instruction of a technical kind, upon 
such subjects as breathing, enunciation, dramatic ex- 
pression, and the like. These matters occupy about 
half the volume; the other half is rhapsody, and of 
slight value. Tliere is very little of the rhapsodical 
about Mr. Adolph Carpi's " The Pianist and the Art of 
Music " (Lyon & Healy), which we find to be a schol- 
arly and suggestive work. It is strictly what it claims 
to be, " a treatise on piano-playing for teachers and stu- 
dents," and its closing " Outline of Piano Literature " 
is an admirable historical presentation of the subject. 

THE " Memories of Dean Hole " (Macmillan) has 
been reviewed at great length in THE DIAL, and we 
now mention it to call attention to the new and cheaper 
edition in which it is offered to the public. Published 
less than a year ago, the demand for this entertaining- 
work has exhausted five editions. The sixth, now pub- 
lished, is in crown octavo, and, to our mind, more at- 
tractive in form than the original. 

" RECREATIONS in Botany " (Harper) is the title of 
a pleasing volume of popular science by Miss Caroline 
A. Creevey. It marshals many of the curiosities of 
botanical science for the information of the beginner, 
and is written in fairly popular style, although unhesi- 
tating use is made, when necessary, of scientific termin- 
ology. The illustrations are satisfactory. The book 
may be commended to those who wish to learn some- 
thing substantial of botany without attacking the tech- 
nical manuals. 

THE " Health Resorts of Europe," by Dr. Thomas 
Linn (Apple ton), is a medical guide to the various 
springs, health resorts, and other " cures " of England 
and the Continent. Dr. T. M. Coan contributes a com- 
mendatory preface, in which it is hinted that those who 
seek a European " cure " are probably benefited by the 
change of scene quite as much as by the therapeutic 
qualities of the waters to which the pilgrimage is made. 
But what does Dr. Coan mean by his reference to " Mil- 
ton's famous line about changing one's skies and not 
one's mind " ? 



L.TTERARY XOTES AND NEWS. 

" The Chameleon's Dish " is the title of a forthcom- 
ing volume of lyrics and ballads by Mr. Theodore Til- 
ton, announced by MM. Mesnil-Dramard & Cie., of Paris. 

Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, the son of the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, is about to publish a volume of 
poems. Mr. Benson is a master at Eton, and his poetry is 
calm and reflective, viewing life rather from the ethical 
than the artistic standpoint. The Archbishop's family 
boasts many names of distinction. Mr. E. F. Benson 
has made one of the successes of the season with his 
" Dodo," and Mr. F. R. Benson, the actor, is a nephew 
of the Archbishop. 

Mr. Besant, writing from this country, sent the fol- 
lowing amusing note to the London " Author " for Au- 
gust: "I have just learned from the New York 'Sun' 



that Mr. Buchanan is having a ' quarrel ' with me. It 
generally takes two to make a quarrel, and I am not 
one of the two. However, I hope that Mr. Buchanan 
is thoroughly enjoying himself. When I get home I 
dare say I may find a few remarks to make. But that 
cannot be for some weeks to come not, so far as the 
' Author ' is concerned, until the September number." 

The following note is from the London " Academy ": 
" Dr. Y. Sarruf, the editor of Al-Muktataf,' has just ar- 
rived in London, after having made a tour of the prin- 
cipal cities of Europe. From this country he will pro- 
ceed to Chicago. Dr. Sarruf is also joint editor and 
proprietor of the daily ' Al-Mokattam,' which is consid- 
ered to be the leading native newspaper in Egypt, as 
' Al-Muktataf ' is the leading scientific and literary 
monthly. This periodical, founded about twenty years 
ago, was the first to introduce the latest developments 
of western thought and achievement to the Arabic- 
speaking world." 

Mr. Edwin Lassetter Bynner, the well-known novel- 
ist, and at one time the librarian of the Boston Bar As- 
sociation, died August 5, at his residence at Forest 
Hills, Boston. Mr. Bynner combined literary with legal 
pursuits. He took his degree of LL.B. at the Harvard 
Law School in 1867. He was the author of numerous 
magazine articles on early New England life, and of 
the chapters, " Topography and Landmarks of the Colo- 
nial Period " and " Topography and Landmarks of the 
Provincial Period," in the Memorial History of Boston. 
"The Begum's Daughter," " Agnes Surriage," and 
" Zacliary Phips " are the titles of his novels. 

The treatment by the English papers of the July Con- 
gress of Authors is in striking contrast to the almost 
complete neglect of that event by the papers of this 
country. It is hardly too much to say that THE DIAL 
published the only intelligent account of the Congress 
that has appeared on this side of the Atlantic. On the 
other hand, the London " Times " devoted a long arti- 
cle to the subject; the London "Athenaeum" found 
space for two important letters, sending to the Congress 
a special correspondent for the purpose of preparing 
them; and the London "Author" reprinted in full the 
six-page account published in THE DIAL for July 16. 

The following is from the London "Academy": 
" A well-known scholar and man of letters has sent the 
following jeu d'esprit to Dr. Murray, on hearing the 
news that the New English Dictionary has at last got 
through the letter C, and that D is now in hand : 
' Wherever the English speech has spread, 

And the Union Jack flies free, 
The news will be gratefully, proudly read 
That you've conquered your ABC! 
But I fear it will come 
As a shock to some 
That the sad result must be 

That you 're taking to dabble and dawdle and doze, 
To dulness and dumps, and (worse than those) 
To danger and drink, 
And shocking to think 
To words that begin with a d .' " 

This is the jubilee year of the great publishing house 
of Macmillan & Co., their first book having appeared 
in 1843. Daniel Macmillan was the founder of the 
house, which first did business in Glasgow. He soon 
removed to London, and then to Cambridge, his brother 
Alexander being associated with him. The former died 
in 1857, but the latter still lives as the senior member 
of the firm. In 1863 the headquarters of the firm was 



122 



[Sept. 1, 



transferred to London, and the Cambridge business 
came into the hands of Macmillan and Bowes, a distinct 
firm. In 1859 " Macmillan's Magazine " was started. 
From 1863 to 1880 Mr. A. Macmillan was official pub- 
lisher to the University of Oxford. In 1867 he vis- 
ited this country, and the result of the visit was the 
establishment, in 1869, of a branch house in New York, 
under the management of Mr. George E. Brett. On 
Mr. Brett's death, in 1890, the New York branch be- 
came an independent firm, with Mr. George P. Brett, 
his son, as the resident American partner. The firm 
has just moved into its new building at No. 66 Fifth 
Avenue. The present members of the London firm are 
Messrs. Alexander, Frederick, George, and Maurice 
Macmillan, and Mr. George L. Craik. American authors 
figure largely in the Macmillan catalogue, which, car- 
ried down only to 1889, fills an octavo volume of 568 
pages. It includes, as everyone knows, many of the 
greatest names in modern English literature. 

The following letter, written by Mr. Alfred B. Ma- 
son to the New York " Critic," has more than a local 
application. 

" The Sculpture Society is prematurely born. The hopes, 
the efforts, the money which it will absorb should be con- 
centrated on an older and more modest organization the 
Iconoclast Society. It is our purpose to destroy the chief hor- 
rors of existence in New York City. We propose, first, to 
blow up with suitable ceremonies a certain (or uncertain) 
cockchafer impaled on a pin (see Johnson's Dictionary : 
' Cockchafer, an animal unlike anything else on earth '), which 
disfigures Washington Square and has been labelled ' Gari- 
baldi ' by some hater of Italy. We shall then remove with 
proper violence a statue on the east side of Central Park 
which represents a forgotten retail clothier named S. F. 
B. Morse in the act of offering for sale to the passer-by 
a ' gent's shawl, rich and dressy.' St. Andrew's Day is to be 
celebrated by the obliteration of a misshapen bronze lump 
marked ' Burns,' which now makes walking on the Mall im- 
possible for all but the blind and the very young. Until the 
Iconoclast Society by a judicious combination of good taste 
and gunpowder has thus wrought its perfect work and freed 
the city from these and the kindred monsters which squat 
darkly in our parks, there can be no public taste for the 
Sculpture Society to develop and satisfy." 

We should like to see a branch of the Iconoclast Soci- 
ety established in Chicago, and it might very fittingly 
inaugurate its crusade by the removal, with "proper 
violence," of the bronze statue, alleged to be of Christo- 
pher Columbus, which the directors of the World's Fair 
have erected upon our Lake Front.

JUST PUBLISHED. 

A New Romance by ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. 

DAVID BALFOUR. 

Being Memoirs of his Adventures at Home and Abroad. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Stevenson's new book is a worthy sequel to his great masterpiece, " Kidnapped." It is more than a 
story of romantic adventure, with conspiracies and perils and heroic achievements on land and sea, for it 
makes David the hero of a love affair, the description of which reveals the author's genius in an altogether 
new light. The Adventures of David and his Highland sweetheart carry them both into Holland and France, 
and supply fresh evidence of the author's wonderful power of spirited narrative and bold character painting. 

NEW EDITION, UNIFORM WITH THE ABOVE. 

KIDNAPPED. 

Being Memoirs of the Adventures of David Balfour, in the Year 1751. I2mo, cloth, $1.25. 

'' Mr. Stevenson has never appeared to greater advantage than in ' Kidnapped.' . . . No better book of its kind than 
these ' Adventures of David Balfour' has ever been written. Mr. Stevenson confesses in a note his own great kindness for 
Alan and Davie, and half promises to tell what further befell them after their parting in Edinburgh a promise which the 
friends they have already made long to see fulfilled." The Nation. 



A New Book by ROBERT GRANT. 

A Sequel to " THE BEFLECTIONS OF A MARRIED MAN."

With many Illustrations by C. S. REINHART and W. T. SMEDLEY. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

An unusually large circle of eager readers will be found waiting for Robert Grant's " Opinions of a Phil- 
osopher"; for his "Reflections," to which this is a sequel, appealed to and made friends of a larger public 
than any book of its class in recent years. Every one who remembers at how many points, both tender and 
laughable, the story of Fred and Josephine's young married life in the " Reflections " touched his own, will be 
anxious to follow the couple through their middle life. The illustrations reflect admirably both the grave 
and the comic elements in the story.

THE REFLECTIONS OF A MARRIED MAN.

" Nothing is more entertaining than to have one's familiar experiences take objective form ; and few experiences are 
more familiar than those which Mr. Grant here chronicles for us. Altogether Mr. Grant has given us a capital little book, 
which should easily strike up literary comradeship with "Reveries of a Bachelor." Boston Transcript.

Charles Scribner's Sons' New Books 



With Thackeray in America. 

New and charming glimpses of the great novelist are given in this chatty and readable book of Mr. Crowe, 

the artist who accompanied Thackeray on his journeyings in this country. The rapid and graphic narrative 

also describes the writer's own very lively impressions of the country and people 

of forty years ago. The author's vigorous sketches of persons and places are 

really historical memoranda of value, and include portraits of the most eminent 

notabilities of that day, and of characteristic scenes which have now wholly 

passed away.

T. Y. CROW ELL & CO.'S &{EW PUBLICATIONS Continued. 



Ingleside. 

By BARBARA YECHTON. Illustrated by JESSIE Mc- 
DKRMOTT. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

This story, published as a serial in the Churchman last year, won 
the unqualified praise of its readers. Great desire was manifested for 
its publication in book form. It has been revised and enlarged by the 
addition of one or two lively chapters. 

The Musical Journey of Dorothy and Delia. 

By the Rev. BRADLEY OILMAN. Illustrated by F. G. 

ATTWOOD. 8vo, unique binding, $1.25. 

The author has carried out a quaint conceit in a manner that places it 
on a level with "Alice's Adventures." The illustrations are capital. 

Margaret Davis, Tutor. 

By ANNA C. HAY, author of " Half a Dozen Boys," 
" Half a Dozen Girls," etc. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25. 

In this story Miss Ray takes a wider outlook than she has hitherto 
done. Her forte lies in the depicting of healthy boys and girls ; but the 
story is bound together by a wholesome thread of romance which greatly 
deepens its interest. It is the best work she has as yet produced. 



The True Woman. 

Elements of character drawn from the Life of Mary 
Lyon and others. By the Rev. W. M. TIIAYER, au- 
thor of " The Farmer Boy," " Nelson," etc. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, $1.25. 

Nearly 100,000 copies of this biography have been sold ; but the 
author, feeling that there has been a great change in public sentiment 
regarding the employment of women, has entirely rewritten it from the 
modern standpoint. It is sure to have a still wider popularity. 

Famous Voyagers and Explorers. 

By SARAH K. BOLTON, author of "Poor Boys Who 
Became Famous," etc. Illustrated with portraits of 
Columbus, Raleigh, Sir John Franklin, Livingstone, 
and others. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mrs. Bolton in her latest volume tells in her unaffected, entertain- 
ing style of the great work performed by some of the world's greatest 
explorers. All but one or two were concerned in the discovery of this 
continent, so that the book is peculiarly appropriate for the Columbian 
year. Lofty lessons of perseverance and heroism are inculcated. 



HANDY VOLUME CLASSICS. 

IN PROSE AND POETRY. 

Handy in size, carefully printed on good paper, and bound in faultless styles. Each volume is illustrated with a frontis- 
piece and title-page in photogravure, and most of the volumes have numerous additional illustrations by the best artists. 
This attractive series has proved to be a favorite with those desiring something new and dainty for gifts or for the drawing- 
room table, and with the general reader or student who prefers his reading in small, companionable volumes. 

All of the volumes in the series are bound uniformly in the following styles :

WILLIAM CONGREVE. 



Master of words ! thine was the perfect art 

To catch the living phrase, no coin of thought, 

But thought's bright self, that, clear and roundly wrought, 

Distinct in air and sunshine, sends a start 

Of fresh delight through the worn sense. Apart 

From common ways of fumbling speech, where naught 

Rings true, thy crystal bells pure-toned are fraught 

With bliss for thrilling nerves. . . . But for the heart ? 

Potent the flow : nor flashing, pouting smiles 
Of Millamant can witch away the shame 
And hardness of her world. Yet while we blame, 
While our need craves some sterner, sweeter bard 
Whose trumpet-cry more than all joy beguiles, 
Thy keen truth leaps to flame, and night is starred ! 

MARIAN MEAD. 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

A considerable portion of the space in this 
issue of THE DIAL is devoted to the regular 
annual list of classified announcements of forth- 
coming books. The list is a long one and 
would have been much longer had it not been 
thought best to exercise a certain discrimina- 
tion and to omit many titles of minor interest. 
It is believed that everything of real import- 
ance thus far definitely included in the an- 
nouncements of American publishers will be 
found comprised. Certainly, the list offers no 
evidence that the general commercial depres- 
sion of recent months has extended to the pub- 
lishing business ; it rather indicates, if any- 
thing, that the business has made more exten- 
sive plans and assumed a broader scope than 
usual. It is, however, true that the effects of 
commercial depression would require some time 
to become manifest in publishers' lists. Books 
are taken in hand long before they are pub- 
licly announced, and the close of one season 
finds the work of the next well under way. 

In the department of historical literature, 
several noteworthy works are promised. Per- 
haps the most important are a work on Massa- 
chusetts, by Mr. Charles Francis Adams ; a 
study in geographical discovery in the interior 
of North America, by Dr. Justin Winsor ; a 
history of the English town in the fifteenth cen- 
tury, by Miss Alice Stopford Green ; and a 
three-volume translation of the memoirs of the 
Chancellor Pasquier. In biography, we must 
mention first of all the life of Lowell which 
Professor Woodberry has been writing for the 
" American Men of Letters " series. The 
author is sure to bring both scholarship and 
literary grace to the work, and we will not 
quarrel with the fact that the biography is to 
fill two volumes, although such extended treat- 
ment is probably disproportionate to the scope 
of the series. While on the subject of Lowell, 
we must not forget to mention the two prom- 
ised volumes of letters, edited with loving care 
by Professor Norton. Other promised biog- 
raphies are a life of Jared Sparks, by Profes- 
sor Herbert B. Adams ; of Dean Stanley, by 
Mr. K. E. Prothero ; of Edwin Booth, by Mr. 
William Winter ; of Cardinal Manning, by 
Mr. Edmund Sheridan Purcell ; of William

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16. 



Jay, by Mr. Bayard Tuckerman ; and the au- 
tobiography of Signer Salvini. 

Among works of general literature the first 
place must be given to the familiar letters of 
Scott, edited by Mr. David Douglas ; and to 
Professor Jebb's volume of Turn bull lectures 
upon classical Greek poetry. We are to have 
the works of George William Curtis and of 
Thomas Paine two very unlike worthies 
each in four volumes ; the one edited by Pro- 
fessor Norton, and the other by the Rev. M. D. 
'Conway. We are also to have a new volume 
of papers by Emerson, most of which have seen 
the light in the magazines. The letters of Asa 
trray will have much more than a scientific in- 
terest, and will fill two volumes. Pleasing, at 
least, will be the volumes of essays by Mr. 
Henry James and Miss Agnes Repplier, and 
Mr. Lang's additional " Letters to Dead Au- 
thors." 

The announcements in poetry and fiction are 
so numerous that we hardly know where to stop 
in our selection, although it is easy to begin, in 
the one class, with Parsons's poems and trans- 
lation of Dante ; in the other, with the " Pan 
Michael " of Mr. Sienkiewicz, which will com- 
plete the great historical trilogy of the Polish 
novelist. Volumes of new verse are promised by 
Mr. R. W. Gilder, Mr. Bliss Cf.rman, the Rev. 
E. E. Hale, Professor C. G. D. Roberts, and 
Miss Mary Robinson, besides Professor Gold- 
win Smith's collection of translations from the 
Latin poets. In fiction, we may soon expect 
" The Coast of Bohemia," by Mr. Howells ; 
" His Vanished Star," by Miss Murfree ; " The 
Copperhead," by Mr. Harold Frederic ; " The 
White Islander," by Mrs. Catherwood ; " Ma- 
rion Darche," by Mr. Crawford ; and " A Gen- 
tleman of France," by Mr. Stanley J. Wey- 
man. 

In art, the most interesting announcements 
are a volume of cats in photogravure, by Mad- 
ame Ronner, who has made the expression of 
feline character quite her own province ; a 
sumptuous work on French illustrators, by M. 
Louis Morin ; a great work on Rembrandt, by 
M. Emile Michel ; and a portfolio of proofs 
from " The Century." Serious travel will be 
represented by Dr. Nansen's work on Eskimo 
life and the late Professor Freeman's studies of 
travel in Italy and Greece. In lighter vein, 
we are sure to find enjoyment in Mr. Janvier's 
" An Embassy to Provence," in Miss Margaret 
Symonds's Lombard sketches, in Mr. Scollard's 
" On Sunny Shores," and in Mr. Lafcadio 
Hearn's " Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan." 



Educators will be glad to find collected into a 
volume Dr. J. M. Rice's " Forum " articles on 
the public schools of our large cities, and will 
welcome the extensive lists of text-books of- 
fered in all departments by several publishing 
firms. In economics, the most important an- 
nouncement appears to be Professor John S. 
Nicholson's history of political economy. 

In the other departments, our list must be 
left to speak for itself. There will clearly be 
no dearth of new works upon science, philoso- 
phy, and religion ; no lack of choice among 
books for holiday gifts or of literature for youth- 
ful readers. The latter categories, indeed, are 
already bewildering in the variety that they in- 
clude, but still additional announcements may 
be expected during the coming weeks. 



A FRENCH VIEW OF AMERICAN 
COPYRIGHT. 

We mentioned, some time ago, the "Note sur 
1'Acte du 3 Mars, 1891," printed in pamphlet form 
by the French Syndicat pour la Protection de la 
Proprie'te' Litte'raire et Artistique, and sent by that 
body as its contribution to the proceedings of the 
Congress of Authors. Another mark of French in- 
terest in the Congress takes the shape of a lengthy 
communication from the Association Litte'raire et 
Artistique Internationale, also sent to the Congress, 
although addressed in form to the President of the 
American Copyright League. We subjoin a trans- 
lation of the more important passages of this com- 
munication. After the usual preliminary salutations, 
accompanied by congratulations upon the work al- 
ready done by the Copyright League, the letter 
proceeds to comment upon the Law of 1891 : 

" The American law, by its recognition of the rights 
of authors during a period of forty-two years, has sanc- 
tioned intellectual property in an excellent manner, and 
although, in most European countries, these rights are 
protected for a minimum period of fifty years after the 
death of the author, we do not think that a modifica- 
tion of the law in this respect should be urged. But 
the question is different when we come to consider the 
formalities to be complied with. You are aware that 
all our efforts are directed towards the recognition of 
intellectual property without the necessity of complying 
with any formalities. In France, for example, the 
right comes into existence ipso facto with the act of pub- 
lication, no registration being necessary. If registra- 
tion is made at the Department of the Interior, it is 
considered merely as an administrative formality, and 
its omission neither lessens nor weakens the right of 
ownership. 

" In the United States such registration has been 
deemed necessary to the very existence of the right of 
ownership. We can only bow to the will of the legis- 
lator, which seems, however, to have exceeded its limits 
when, in the case of works by foreign authors, it has 
added to the registration clause the obligation of re-

manufacture upon American soil, with American type 
and paper. 

" We understand clearly the nature of the consider- 
ations that have impelled the legislator to protect a na- 
tional industry by reserving to American printers a 
monopoly of the manufacture of books circulating in 
the United States. 

" But, setting aside the question of books published 
in the English language, we venture to observe that, 
as far as it concerns books published in French, Italian, 
Spanish, German, or other languages, the manufactur- 
ing clause acts adversely to the object proposed. 

"In fact, the considerable expense that it imposes 
upon foreign authors constitutes an almost insurmount- 
able obstacle to their claim of the right which the law 
concedes. 

" It is clearly the interest of American publishers 
to secure, at a low cost, the ownership of works pub- 
lished in Europe. But every contract made by them 
with a foreign author is heavily handicapped by the pre- 
liminary manufacturing clause. 

" Yet the intention of the legislator to recognize the 
rights of the foreign author is very distinctly expressed. 
How did it come about that he at the same time made 
the exercise of those rights almost impossible ? Would 
it not have been more logical to prohibit the importa- 
tion into the United States of all translations manufac- 
tured abroad ? In this way the monopoly of manufac- 
ture would remain with the American publishers and 
printers. The foreign author would register his work 
at the Washington library, and this registration would 
form the basis of the contract to be made between him 
and the American publisher, the latter being guaranteed 
against competition by his inalienable right to the mate- 
rial manufacture of the translation upon American soil. 

" We believe this to be the path that the legislator 
should take. With music and the graphic arts, likewise, 
it seems to us that it should suffice (the work being 
registered, and two copies manufactured in the country 
of its origin being deposited at Washington) to reserve 
to American publishers the monopoly of re-manufacture 
upon American soil, a contract having been made with 
the author. 

" It would be preferable, indeed, that the free circu- 
lation of intellectual works were assured throughout the 
whole world, but it is not for us to dictate to the United 
States a rule of conduct in a matter of which they alone 
must judge. We merely seek a modus vivendi, appli- 
cable to, yet improving, the present situation. 

" We beg also to call your attention to the wellnigh 
insurmountable difficulties arising from the legal re- 
quirement of registration at Washington on the very 
day of publication in the original country. Questions 
of distance play such a part in the relations of Europe 
with the United States that we need not insist upon a 
point so obvious. The legislative condition of registra- 
tion at Washington would be fulfilled even if foreign 
authors were to be granted a month or two of grace. 
We believe that this modification, based upon logic and 
the force of circumstances, would not meet with serious 
opposition." 

The letter closes with the expression of a wish 
that the French Society might enter into closer and 
more continuous relations with the American Copy- 
right League, and with an invitation to take part 
in the proceedings of the International Literary 
and Artistic Congress to be held at Barcelona, and 
opened the twenty-third of this month. 



IBSEN'S TREATMENT OF SELF- 
ILLUSION. 

In no play of Ibsen's is the corrosive self-destroy- 
ing character of his social criticism more apparent 
than in " The Wild Duck." " A Doll-House " and 
" The Pillars of Society " enforced the lesson that 
unless there be truth in personal and social rela- 
tions they cannot endure ; they are built upon sand, 
and cannot brave the shocks of adversity. This 
was perhaps the first positive lesson to be derived 
from Ibsen's teachings. We felt that here we had 
at last firm ground under our feet ; and Pilate's 
pertinent query, " What is truth ? " we left prelim- 
inarily in abeyance. But no sooner have we 
opened "The Wild Duck " than we find the earth 
rocking and heaving in the most uncomfortable man- 
ner. That which we mistook for rock was after all 
nothing but quagmire. " The Wild Duck " teaches 
us that the truth is by no means an unqualified boon. 
It takes a strong spirit to endure it. To small, com- 
monplace men, living in mean illusions, the truth 
may be absolutely destructive. It is better for such 
people to be permitted to cherish undisturbed their 
little lies and self-deceptions than to be brought 
face to face with the terrifying truth, lacking, as 
they do, both the courage and the strength to grap- 
ple with it and to readjust their lives to radically 
altered conditions. 

It appears to me as if Ibsen had undertaken to 
satirize himself in this play. " I have told you be- 
fore that you must above all be truthful," he seems 
to say ; " that you must live your individual lives, 
and refuse to adapt yourselves to the code of con- 
duct of your Philistine neighbors ; that you must 
drain, if necessary, the wholesome cup of woe that 
is put to your lips, and rise through suffering to a 
higher and nobler manhood and womanhood. But 
if you have been innocent enough to take me at my 
word in these injunctions, I now find that they stand 
in need of revision. It is not improbable that you 
may be too paltry to be benefited by such heroic 
diet, in which case I advise you to ignore what I 
have said and remain in your old slough of pusillani- 
mous mendacity and contentment." 

This is the obvious moral of " The Wild Duck," 
if a moral it can be called. The situation is as fol- 
lows : 

Hjalmar Ekdal, a photographer in a small town, 
is a lazy, miserable good-for-nothing, but with a 
taste for theatrical phrase-making and grand atti- 
tudes. He lives a sort of heroic dream-life, de- 
voting himself, in fancy at least, to the perfecting 
of a great invention, about which he talks a great 
deal, without, however, making any visible progress. 
By means of the fame which will come to him from 
this beneficent enterprise, he intends to obliterate 
the disgrace which has befallen his father, and vin- 
dicate the family honor. The elder Ekdal, an ex- 
lieutenant and lumber speculator, has been sentenced 
to the penitentiary for violation of the forestry laws, 
and, after having served out his sentence, is now 



138 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



living with his son. He earns a little money by 
copying documents for his former partner, the man- 
ufacturer Werle, and promptly gets drunk on part 
of the proceeds of his industry. He is half in his 
dotage, and utterly devoid of all sense of honor. 
In the loft of the house he has arranged a sort 
of mock-forest, consisting of some old Christmas 
trees, in the branches of which hens and pigeons 
roost. Here he has also collected some rabbits, 
and amuses himself by firing at them with a pis- 
tol and a gun which always clicks. From the ser- 
vants of Werle he has obtained a wild duck, which, 
after having been wounded by their master, had 
been retrieved by his dogs. Hedwig, his grand- 
daughter, a little girl of fourteen, takes a great 
fancy to this wild waterfowl, and daily spends 
Chappy hours in the dark loft, watching the rabbits 
and the pigeons. Her father, Hjalmar, though he 
makes a pretence of being deeply absorbed in sci- 
entific meditation, is rarely averse to indulging in 
the same sport as his parent ; and in fact the only 
member of the family for whom the loft has no at- 
traction is his wife Gina, who, by her attention to 
the housekeeping as well as the photographic busi- 
ness, is the mainstay and support of her husband, 
daughter, and father-in-law. She is a simple, un- 
reflecting creature, and is therefore easily imposed 
upon by Hjalmar's theatricals. She honestly be- 
lieves him to be the remarkable genius he pro- 
claims himself to -be, misunderstood and disdained 
by the world, but bound to shed his chrysalis some 
day and rise into the air as a golden butterfly. 
She had in her maiden days been a servant in 
Werle's employ, and the marriage had, in fact, been 
arranged by the great manufacturer. There was a 
rumor afloat that she had also been his mistress ; 
but if it had ever reached Hjalmar's ears, he magnan- 
imously ignored it. 

Now all these people are living more "or less sor- 
did lives, but each one is happy in his particular 
illusion. Ekdal hunts imaginary bears in an im- 
aginary forest, and gets drunk as often as he can af- 
ford it. If he dreams of the contempt with which 
he is regarded, he is not in the least troubled by it. 
Hjalmar glories in being a misunderstood genius, 
poses as a model husband, son, and father, and though 
the very incarnation of ruthless selfishness, drapes 
himself most successfully in a garb of virtue, as 
substantial as the Emperor's new clothes in Hans 
Christian Andersen's story. His daughter takes 
all his fine phrases at their face value, and while she 
wears out her little life retouching photographs for 
him, is greatly moved and edified by his magnanim- 
ity. He knows that she is losing her eye-sight, and 
makes pathetic speeches about her gliding into the 
eternal night, but it does not occur to him to re- 
lieve her of her labor. 

Gina, finally, is contented enough, after her 
fashion, because she demands but little of life, and 
has too blunt a conscience to be troubled by her 
past delinquency as long as it is safely hidden. 

Into the midst of this peaceful circle drops one 



day Gregers Werle, a son of the manufacturer and 
a former schoolfellow of Hjalmar. He knows the 
true state of affairs, and regards it as a sacred 
duty to reveal to his friend the ignominy in which 
he is living. He has been dazzled by his grand 
professions, which he takes for good coin. He be- 
lieves that a relation founded upon a lie can never 
be a happy one ; and persuades himself that the 
truth, under all circumstances, is wholesome and 
purifying. Hjalmar and Gina, standing, as it 
were, soul to soul, stripped of their false draperies, 
will, he thinks, find each other and be united in a 
true and ideal marriage. But in these suppositions 
he reckons without his host. The photographer, 
when he learns of his wife's former liason and the 
paternity of his supposed child, is not so very deeply 
shocked ; nay, at bottom, perhaps, he is nearly in- 
different. But he knows what is expected of him 
in such a moment ; and he casts about him for a 
truly heroic part. He must justify Gregers's opin- 
ion of him, and the demands of his own dignity. 
So he summons his wife, and in lofty phrases cate- 
chizes her concerning her past. The poor simple 
soul confesses unhesitatingly. She is delightful 
in her blunt honesty, which contrasts so glaringly 
with her husband's high-flown hypocrisy. When 
reproached for not having confessed before their 
marriage, she asks, naively : 

" But would you have married me all the same ? 

HJALMAK. How can you imagine such a thing ? 

CZINA. No ; but that was the reason I did not dare tell 
you anything then. For I got to love you very much, as you 
know. And I could not go and make myself completely un- 
happy." 

When asked if she has not suffered an anguish 
of remorse during all these years, she replies : 

" Why, dear kdal, I've had enough to do in attending to 
the house and the daily supervision of things." 

Such callousness, such degradation, makes Hjal- 
mar despair or, I should say, assume the mask of 
despair. He must (though it tires him a little) re- 
main upon the heights of sublimity to which he has 
mounted. He commands Gina to- pack his trunk. 
He must separate from her. He cannot continue 
to live a life of infamy, practically supported by a 
former rival for his wife's favor ; for he learns that 
Werle has constantly overpaid the elder Ekdal 
for his copying, and that it is this money which has 
enabled them to maintain their household in com- 
fort. But now all this must come to an end. With 
a grand gesture, Hjalmar tears to pieces a docu- 
ment in which the elder Werle pledges himself to 
pay one hundred crowns per month to the elder 
Ekdal, and after the latter's death to continue the 
payment of the same sum to Hedwig. With fever- 
ish impatience he makes all the preparations for 
his departure from his desecrated home, and revels 
all the while in the admiration of his friend Gre- 
gers. But when the moment comes for decisive 
action, he wavers. On one flimsy pretext after 
another, he postpones his journey. He thrusts 
Hedwig away from him, and cruelly wounds the 
feelings of the affectionate child. He fumes and

frets while considering the more sordid aspect of 
the situation which now presents itself to him. He 
concludes to do nothing rash ; but to remain at 
home until he can find new lodgings. With great 
care he collects the scattered bits of Werle's prom- 
issory note and pastes them together, because he has 
no right, he avers, to renounce what is not his own. 
Gina brings him coffee and sandwiches, which he 
consumes with a lugubrious zest ; and though he is 
a little shamefaced when Gregers surprises him in 
this prosaic occupation, he endeavors, though not 
quite successfully, to recover his heroic tone. He 
is really anxious to be persuaded to remain ; but 
feels in duty bound to yield only by degrees, and 
with the proper amount of high-flown declamation. 
He enjoys the interesting situation, and cannot af- 
ford to dismiss it before having displayed his full 
arsenal of noble sentiments. 

The child, of course, which he has cherished like 
a snake in his bosom, offers unlimited opportuni- 
ties for fine rhetoric ; and Hjalmar does not fail 
to improve them. Gregers, to whom Hedwig has 
betrayed her grief, because her father will no longer 
believe that she loves him, has persuaded her to 
prove her love for him by the highest sacrifice in 
her power. And as the wild duck is the thing 
she is fondest of, while Hjalmar has always pro- 
fessed to dislike it, Gregers advises her to kill it 
with her own hand. But so great is her misery, her 
feeling of superfluity and disgrace, that she turns 
the pistol against herself and sends the bullet into 
her own heart. 

Ibsen sums up the moral of his play in the words 
of Dr. Relling (a cynical friend of the family) : 

" Life might yet be quite tolerable, if we were only left in 
peace by these blessed duns who are continually knocking at 
the doors of us poor folk with their ' ideal demand.' " 

Rarely has a poet so ruthlessly satirized himself 
as Ibsen does in this remark. For it was this very 
ideal demand of which he had proclaimed himself 
the prophet. He is the most persistent of those 
duns who knock at the door of the average human 
soul, and disturb its sleepful contentment by their 
unwearied insistence upon full payment. But the 
bankrupt debtor is obliged to compromise at twenty, 
forty, or sixty per cent, or utterly repudiate the 
debt ; and the stern reminders of his dun cannot 
make him pay more than he has. 

The mood in which Ibsen wrote " The Wild 
Duck " was one of deep dejection if not despair. 
" You have got to take men as they are made," 
he seems to have said to himself, " and no amount 
of preaching will make them any better than they 
are. I, with my ideal demand, may have been as 
great a mischief-maker as Gregers Werle." And 
in order to emphasize this cynical lesson, he has in 
the relation of the elder Werle to Mrs. SOrby fur- 
nished a counter foil to the Ekdal couple, who, 
after the revelation of the truth, settle down in a 
sort of hideous shivering nudity into a barren and 
joyless slough, stripped of all embellishing dra- 
pery. Werle senior is an utterly prosaic person, 



and frankly tells his fiancee of all his escapades ; 
whereupon she, encouraged by his freedom from 
prejudice, makes an equally compromising confes- 
sion. These two then form a marriage based upon 
the truth ; and we are left to form our own con- 
clusions as to the nature of their union. 

No, the truth is only for the strong ; and the 
strong are few. The ordinary man needs more or 
less harmless lies to bolster up his self-respect ; for 
without self-respect there can be no contentment. 
This is the doctrine very trenchantly preached by 
Dr. Relling, who charitably devotes himself to in- 
venting the fitting lie which will minister to the 
happiness of each of his patients. It is he who in- 
stills into Hjalmar's mind the idea that he is des- 
tined to make a great discovery, which will lift 
photography into the region of exact science ; and 
with the same ingenuity he saves the self-respect of 
his bibulous friend, the theologian Molvik, by per- 
suading him that his drunkenness is " daemonic " 
i. e., the necessary and inevitable outbreak of some 
great undelivered force within him which has not 
found expression in its proper sphere. 

If instead of the ugly word " lie " we substitute 
its poetic synonym "illusion," I fancy no one will 
seriously object to Dr. Rolling's theory. For every 
one of us has his own illusion of life, himself in- 
cluded ; and his happiness depends upon the vivid- 
ness, the completeness, with which he is able to fit 
this illusion into actuality, or as much of it as ob- 
trudes itself upon his observation. I know I am a 
greater, a more admirable man in my own estimation 
than, most probably, I am in the estimation of the 
majority of my friends ; and if I did not have the 
private consolation of knowing that I am right and 
that they are wrong, I should not regard existence 
as much of a boon. My happiness nay, my very 
desire for self-preservation therefore depends upon 
my power of self-deception. If any Mephisto- 
phelian friend should ever succeed in convincing 
me of what infinitely small account I am in the 
world what a fortuitous agglomeration of atoms, 
hovering in the boundless space I fear I should 
be tempted to follow the example of poor Hedwig. 
I can imagine no greater calamity that could befall 
a man than a sudden opening of his vision a sud- 
den dispelling of all illusion enabling him to real- 
ize with absolute correctness his relations to the uni- 
verse. 

In " Brand " Ibsen quotes with approval the 
scriptural passage, "No man can see Jehovah and 
live." All truth that we see, in this life, is largely 
alloyed with falsehood ; it is relative, not absolute. 
As Lessing says, " If God held truth shut in His 
right hand, and in his left hand nothing but the 
ever restless striving for truth, though with the con- 
dition of forever erring, and should say to me, 
' Choose,' I would humbly bow to His left hand and 
say, ' Father, give me this ; pure truth is for Thee 
alone.' " 

What Lessing meant by truth, in this instance, 
was the great fundamental facts which underlie ex-

good, that illusion is the prime requisite of happiness.

COHMUNICA TIONS. 



A COLUMBIAN CELEBRATION A HUNDRED 

YEARS AGO. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A little book of 77 pages now in my possession fur- 
nishes evidence that the three hundredth anniversary of 
the discovery of America was not allowed to pass un- 
noticed, and affords also some interesting glimpses of 
our country and its affairs as they appeared a hundred 
years ago. Some account of the book and its author 
may therefore be acceptable at this time. The book is 
entitled " An Oration on the Discovery of America, de- 
livered in London, October 12th, 1792." The orator 
was Elhanan Winchester, a noted character in his day. 
According to the best information that I can get, he was 
born near Boston, Mass., in 1751. He began preach- 
ing in his eighteenth year, and, passing through several 
phases of religious belief, finally developed into a Univer- 
salist clergyman. During our Revolution he earnestly 
sympathized with the American cause, composing a num- 
ber of so-called " political hymns," more remarkable for 
their piety and patriotism than for their poetry. After 
the war, in 1787, he visited England, where he remained 
several years, preaching his doctrines of universal sal- 
vation and universal liberty. Returning to America in 
1794, he died at Hartford in 1797. 

Passing over the historical portions of the work, which 
tell the familiar story of Columbus and his discovery very 
much as it is told to-day, and some speculations, more 
curious than valuable, as to the origin of the first inhab- 
itants of our continent, we come to the more interesting 
chapters giving the outlook on America in 1792. The 
population of the entire continent (North, South, and 
Central America) is estimated at twenty millions. When 
as densely populated as Holland then was, the Amer- 
ican continent is capable of containing three thousand 
three hundred and four millions. The orator exclaims : 
" Considered in this light, what an astonishing scene rises 
to our view ! God, who formed the earth, created it not in 
vain ; he formed it to be inhabited ; and I have no doubt that 
before the conflagration takes place, the earth shall be inhab- 
ited and cultivated to the utmost possible extent ; this shall 
be in the glorious millenium, or the thousand years' reign of 
Christ on earth ; which happy period is fast approaching and 
I trust is even at the door. Then, and not till then, shall the 
full importance of the discovery of America be known." 

Among the lessons already taught by the United 
States are enumerated the practicability of democracy, 
the wisdom of separating church and state, the justice 
of abolishing cruel and unnecessarily severe punishment 
for crime, and the strength of a mild and equable form 
of government as contrasted with the weakness of more 
arbitrary principalities. 

Notwithstanding the near approach of the millennium, 
which he has just predicted, the orator foretells the 
rapid development of his native land in the following 
prophecy, which has been so abundantly fulfilled: 

" The century to come will improve America far more than 



the three centuries past. The prospect opens, it extends it- 
self upon us. ' The wilderness and solitary place shall rejoice, 
and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.' I look 
forward to that glorious day when that vast continent shall 
be populated with civilized and religious people, when heav- 
enly wisdom and virtue, and all that can civilize and bless the 
children of men, shall cover that part of the globe as the 
waters cover the seas. 

" Transported at the thought, I am borne forward to days 
of distant renown. In my expanded view, the United States 
rise in all their ripened glory before me. I look through and 
beyond every yet peopled region of the New World, and be- 
hold period still brightening upon period. Where one con- 
tiguous depth of gloomy wilderness now shuts out even the 
beams of day, I see new states and empires, new seats of wis- 
dom and knowledge, new religious domes spreading around. 
In places now untrod by any but savage beasts, or men as 
savage as they, I hear the voice of happy labor, and see beau- 
tiful cities rising to view, behold the whole continent highly 
cultivated and fertilized, full of cities, towns, and villages, 
beautiful and lovely beyond expression. I hear the praises 
of my great Creator sung upon the banks of these rivers now 
unknown to song. Behold the delightful prospect ! See the 
silver and gold of America employed in the service of the 
Lord of the whole earth ! See slavery, with all its train of 
attendant evils, forever abolished ! See a communication 
opened through the whole continent, from north to south and 
from east to west, through a most fruitful country. Behold 
the glory of God extending, and the Gospel spreading through 
the whole land ! " 

An appendix to the published oration contains the pre- 
posterous " political hymns " already alluded to, a bio- 
graphical sketch of George Washington, and a plan and 
description of the new city to be called Washington,, 
"at the junction of the rivers Pawtomack and the East- 
ern branch." The valleys of the Mississippi and the 
Missouri, the Great Basin of the West, and the Pacific 
Coast, constituted an unknown land. The western line 
of Pennsylvania was the limit of civilization. The 
present national capital, with its throngs of people com- 
ing and going daily, is described as situated upon " the 
great post road, equi-distant from the northern and 
southern extremities of the Union, and nearly so from 
the Atlantick and Pittsburg." Added to this is the 
first census of the United States recently completed and 
certified to by "T. Jefferson, Secretary of State." The 
total population of the republic in 1792 footed up 3,925,- 
253. The five largest states in point of population were 
Virginia, 747,610; Pennsylvania, 434,373; North Car- 
olina, 393,751; Massachusetts, 378,587; New York, 
340,120. Maine and Massachusetts were the only states 
not possessing slaves. In Virginia the slaves numbered 
292,627; in New York, 21,324. The towns in point of 
size ranked, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Balti- 
more, and Charleston; in trade, New York, Philadelphia, 
Boston, Charleston, and Baltimore. 

How far Mr. Winchester succeeded in instilling Amer- 
ican principles into the minds of his hearers, it is im- 
possible to say. One cannot fail to admire his courage, 
however, in stoutly proclaiming his convictions in the 
very centre of British conservatism, while resentment 
against the young republic was still bitter and the term 
" Yankee " was considered synonymous with rebel. Could 
he have realized how accurately his predictions would 
be fulfilled by the next Columbian centenary, it would 
have given peculiar emphasis to his closing paragraph: " I 
die ; but God will surely visit America, and make it a vast, 
flourishing, and populous empire ; will take it under his 
protection, and bless it abundantly; but the prospect 
is too glorious for my pen to describe. I add no more."

Ax OLI> HOPE ix A XEW TJIGHT.* 



The essay, considered strictly as a work of 
literary art, has had in our day no more strik- 
ing illustration than may be found in the vol- 
umes of Mr. Frederic Myers. A pure and 
weighty style, producing, without any trick of 
rhythmical imitation, an effect akin to the po- 
etical, combined with a selection and arrange- 
ment of material resulting from a rare sense 
of relative values, gives to such essays as those 
upon Virgil and Mazzini a high place among 
the masterpieces of English prose. And we 
must ascribe to them not only such excellence 
of manner, but also a degree of scholarship 
that is not often allowed to appear within the 
limits of the essay. When we add that the 
subjects chosen by Mr. Myers are mostly of 
such nature as to touch upon the highest con- 
cerns, that his essays have for no small part 
of their aim the transformation for modern 
uses, or the translation into modern terms, of 
the best wisdom of the past, the large discourse 
of poet and philosopher, we shall at least have 
indicated the nature of their claim upon the 
attention of thoughtful readers. 

We are all the more concerned to give to 
the work of Mr. Myers this unstinted measure 
of praise, because the essays collectively enti- 
tled " Science and a Future Life," which make 
up the author's latest volume, cannot be seri- 
ously reviewed without considerable dissent 
from their conclusions, or without one import- 
ant exception to their form. To take this ex- 
ception first, and to put the matter bluntly, the 
contents of this collection are so colored by the 
peculiar theories of the Society for Psychical 
Research, so characterized by special pleading 
in behalf of a series of propositions consid- 
ered by most serious thinkers not merely im- 
probable but absolutely untenable, that the es- 
says are wanting in the judicial quality of the 
best criticism, and are even, to a certain extent, 
misleading. Whether the subject be " Charles 
Darwin and Agnosticism," u The Disenchant- 
ment of France," or " Modern Poets and Cosmic 
Law," the discussion eventually shapes itself 
into an argument for telepathy, or ghosts, or 
the communion of the living with the dead. 
Mr. Myers has to a certain extent met this ob- 
jection by a title which indicates the common 
tendency of the essays, and adverse criticism is

at least partly disarmed by the unusual candor 
of the writer, by his seBupiriorts care to give to 
the views of his opponents the full weight due 
them, and by the unquestionable honesty of his 
belief that the psychical researchers are really 
on the track of a new cosmic law of funda- 
mental significance. 

The attitude of Mr. Myers toward modern 
science, with its destructive criticism of relig- 
ious beliefs, is very different from that of most 
defenders of the faith. He is sufficiently fa- 
miliar with scientific method to respect its re- 
sults, and never, even by suggestion, invokes 
the odium theologicum in aid of his contention. 
We doubt not, indeed, that he welcomes the 
work done by science in freeing religious 
thought from its accretions of theological rub- 
bish. But he holds firmly, even passionately 
(and passion rarely leaves the judgment un- 
warped), to the belief in a conscious personal 
immortality, seeking to find new grounds for 
the belief, more substantial than those which, 
he admits, science has largely brought into dis- 
credit. "The educated world," he sees, "is 
waking up to find that no mere trifles or tra- 
ditions only, but the great hope which inspired 
their fathers aforetime, is insensibly vanishing 
away." And, claiming that " a question so mo- 
mentous should not thus be suffered to go by 
default," he calls for a new " stocktaking of evi- 
dence," an inquiry whether " any evidence has 
been discovered bearing on a question which, 
after all, is to science a question of evidence 
alone." 

It is in the new field of experimental psy- 
chology that Mr. Myers looks for the new evi- 
dence that is to rehabilitate an old and dying 
hope. He finds such evidence in the recent 
investigations of the abnormal consciousness, 
of the phenomena of hypnotism and multiple 
personality. He also finds it in the curious col- 
lections of the Society for Psychical Research. 
The great majority among men of science, of 
course, reject as totally inadequate the evidence 
for the phenomena of the latter class ; while 
for those of the former class, admitting many 
of them to have received proper evidential sub- 
stantiation, they find necessary no such inter- 
pretation as is given them by Mr. Myers. What 
if there be a subliminal consciousness, they 
say ; what if the personality assume, in cer- 
tain cases, a dual aspect ; what if we have 
learned " to conceive of our normal conscious- 
ness as representing only a fragment of the 
activity going on in our brains " ? Mr. Myers 
is himself candid enough to admit that " these 



142

expanding psychological prospects are still con- 
sistent with the view that all our mental activ- 
ities, however extensive and however subdivis- 
ible, may be dependent on cerebral changes, 
and may end with death." And having made 
this admission, there is little use in his adding, 
* The very magnitude of the change in our con- 
ception of personality might well make us pause 
before repeating the dogmas of negation which 
were framed with regard to far simpler and 
narrower facts." Why should the new con- 
ception of personality " make us pause," if the 
old view of our mental activities is comprehen- 
sive enough to include, without readjustment, 
all the new facts ? To get any really logical sup- 
port for his view, Mr. Myers is compelled to 
rely upon what are denied to be facts by nearly 
all serious psychologists, upon the alleged phe- 
nomena of thought-transference, of " phantasms 
of the living " and of hallucinatory images of 
the dying. It is surely a little premature to 
base a theory of personal immortality upon 
data which have not themselves gained the ac- 
ceptance of even a respectable minority among 
psychologists. It is a good rule to postpone 
the construction of your theory until you have 
established the facts upon which it must of ne- 
cessity rest ; enough of the facts, that is, to 
afford a working foundation. This was the rule 
that Darwin to whom one of the author's es- 
says pays generous tribute followed with such 
magnificent success. 

Mr. Myers, in his opening essay, which bears 
the title given the entire volume, expressly ex- 
cludes from his discussion the " moral and 
emotional arguments " by which belief in a fu- 
ture life is usually supported. Yet he seems 
to us to stand upon firmer ground when he 
comes back to those arguments in a later chap- 
ter. The essay on " Tennyson as Prophet," 
and the other essay, largely devoted to the 
same theme, entitled " Modern Poets and Cos- 
mic Law," offer a plea more convincing than 
any to be based upon the imperfectly appre- 
hended phases of the abnormal consciousness, 
or upon the ill-attested stories collected by the 
Society for Psychical Research. The argument 
from authority is always a dangerous argument 
to invoke, yet surely the authority of a man like 
Tennyson is not lightly to be set aside. The loft- 
iest of the poets have always numbered among 
their functions that of prophecy ; their title to 
enduring fame has rested chiefly upon their 
character as seers, upon their insight, deeper 
than that of their fellow men, into the things of 
the spirit. Now Tennyson, who knew and un- 



derstood as well as any man of his age the 
work of later nineteenth-century science, pre- 
served a faith, that grew stronger with his ad- 
vancing years, in the doctrine of conscious per- 
sonal immortality, a faith to which, in public 
and in private, he frequently gave impas- 
sioned and even vehement expression. This 
fact will not mean to most thinkers as much as 
it means to our essayist, who says : " We have 
lost our head and our chief ; the one man, 
surely, in all the world to-day who, from a tow- 
ering eminence which none could question, af- 
firmed the realities which to us are all." But 
of it the most indifferent must take some ac- 
count ; the most unmoved by Tennyson's spir- 
itual message must still be impressed by the 
cento of passages bearing upon the destinies of 
man, collected by Mr. Myers from the writings 
of the poet. In this aspect of his thought, 
" Tennyson is the prophet simply of a Spir- 
itual Universe : the proclaimer of man's spirit 
as part and parcel of that Universe, and in- 
destructible as the very root of things." 

We may, however, accept this latter prop- 
osition without putting upon it the narrow in- 
terpretation claimed for it by Mr. Myers. He 
would be the last to deny that the philosoph- 
ical view of the universe broadens immensely 
and even transforms the popular notion of im- 
mortality. And he is not well advised to treat 
with covert contempt the Positivist form of 
that notion, comparing it with " the grin with- 
out the cat of the popular fairy tale," and 
adding, with a touch of misplaced satire, that 
" all in this sad world is well, since Auguste 
Comte has demonstrated that the effect of our 
deeds lives after us, so that what we used to 
call eternal death the cessation, in point of 
fact, of our own existence may just as well 
be considered as eternal life of a very superior 
description." Most philosophic thinkers have 
found themselves forced to substitute for the 
narrow personal interpretation of the term im- 
mortality some such interpretation as is em- 
bodied in the Religion of Humanity, or is found 
in the universal soul of the pantheistic philos- 
ophies, or is logically implied in the idealism 
of Berkeley and Schopenhauer. Indeed, many 
of the Tennysonian passages collected by the 
writer in support of the narrower view lend 
themselves with little difficulty to the wider, 
and thus illustrate afresh the fact that the 
really great poet builds better than he knows 
the structure of his song. 

One point more, and we have done. In read- 
ing a book like the one before us we cannot re-

frain from the question : This constant preoc- 
cupation with a life to come this insistent de- 
mand which will be satisfied with nothing less 
than the survival of memory after death, with 
the unbroken continuation of our present series 
of conscious states, is it helpful to the pursu- 
ance of the life that now is, with its manifold 
tasks and obligations? Goethe thought not 
so; nor Emerson ; nor Spinoza, whose splendid 
phrase, " The free man thinks of nothing less 
than of death," gives, to those who have taken 
its meaning to heart, a heightened sense of the 
dignity of the life which is now unquestionably 
ours, if only for a time. And we cannot ad- 
mit, what the author seems to take for granted, 
that the existence of a moral purpose in the 
universe is in any way indissolubly linked with 
the continuation of our individual series of 
states of consciousness. What need of invok- 
ing unknown forces and unseen powers to prove 
that the universe is moral ? Is not man a part 
of the universe, and is there not a moral pur- 
pose in human life ? In what sense, even, can 
we imagine a moral universe except as man 
makes it such ? To our mind, there is a more 
profound conception of the essential meaning 
of morality, a conception closer to the truth 
than that for which Mr. Myers argues, in the 
view of the greatest of our poets now living, 
which the essayist formulates, only to reject as 
inadequate, in the following impressive terms : 
" There is another phase of thought which also 
Mr. Swinburne has presented with singular 
fire. That is the resolve that even if there be 
no moral purpose already in the world, man 
shall put it there ; that even if all evolution be 
necessarily truncated, yet moral evolution, so 
long as our race lasts, there shall be ; that even 
if man's virtue be momentary, he shall act as 
though it were an eternal gain."

THE VEHICLE OF HEREDITY.* 



While the majority of the biologists of the 
present day are engaged in the attempt to un- 
ravel the mysteries of cell life, including that 
most mysterious phase of cytic life, reproduc- 
tion, and are seeking as far as possible, with 
the aid of the microscope, to see all the most 
hidden circumstances of the act, there are also 
a great many other students who are seeking

to add reasoning to the methods of the labora- 
tory and thereby to look behind the scenes and 
have a peep at nature's inmost secrets. Of all 
the writers of this latter class, Professor Weis- 
mann of Freiburg has probably attracted the 
greatest notice. He has during the past ten 
years been publishing articles of the utmost im- 
portance on the general subject of the physical 
structures and mechanisms of cell life and de- 
velopment, the central problem in his series of 
articles having been a mechanical statement of 
the facts of heredity. Noticing the patent fact 
that living creatures tend to produce their kind, 
he has sought to discover among the now im- 
mense mass of accumulated information bear- 
ing on the subject the clue to the cause of this 
so universal truth. A host of other writers 
have also approached the subject, and many of 
them have aided in the attempt at a solution 
of the mystery. But no one of them all has 
presented so completely elaborated and so 
plausible a theory of heredity as that of the 
author now engaging our attention. He has 
written many articles, and they have for the 
most part been translated into our tongue and 
found their way into the hands of a great many 
readers. His latest work constitutes the last 
number of the very valuable " Contemporary 
Science " series entitled " The Germ-Plasm, 
A Theory of Heredity." The book is by no 
means easy reading ; in fact, it is the most ab- 
struse number of the series up to this date. 
There is not, however, any lack of clearness 
either on the part of the writer or the trans- 
lators, though it is inevitable that a work on so 
comparatively unusual a subject should not be 
as instantly intelligible as more usual topics 
are. The translators deserve great credit for 
the way in which they have performed their 
part in this most excellent production. 

The cell is no longer, as of yore, to be con- 
sidered the unit of biological structure, but is 
itself a structure or organism consisting of vi- 
tal units. The seat of the forces of the cell 
is the nucleus, and the controlling factors in 
cell-life are within the nucleus. Moreover, the 
substance of the nucleus is not uniform and ho- 
mogeneous, but is composed of various sorts of 
elements, their variety being greater in cells 
not yet mature than in those that have reached 
their final form and can be called fully devel- 
oped. From this it will be seen to follow 
that the egg cell is the most complex cell in 
the body of any animal ; and this we can be- 
lieve, as we reflect that the body is necessarily 
the result of the development or unfolding of 



144 



THE DIAL 



[Sept 16, 



its contents. The nucleus has been proved to 
be the controlling factor in cell development 
by such observations as this one of Boveri, a 
very expert embryological observer, who took 
the nucleus out of a certain kind of sea ur- 
chin's egg and then fertilized the egg with the 
sperm of another species, whereupon the egg- 
developed not into the species of the mother 
but into that of the spermatozoon. This proves 
that the male nucleus has hereditary power, 
and on other grounds it is shown that the fe- 
male nucleus also has the same power. The 
nucleus is thus shown to be the source of all 
the hereditary influences which actuate the egg, 
and it is likely that this is equally true of all 
cells at all stages of their life. The structure 
of the nucleus is then of the last importance 
for a theory of heredity. It has long been 
known that the nucleus is composed of two 
sorts of substance, one the idioplasm or, as it 
is often called, the chromatin and the other 
a watery non-staining material called the achro- 
matin. The chromatin or idioplasm exhibits 
great differences in different kinds of cells and 
eggs. It is, however, in general composed of 
rods, loops, or coils of deeply stainable material, 
the shapes and arrangement of which are very 
different for different kinds of cells and very 
fixed and constant for different cells of the same 
kind. It is the opinion of Professor Weis- 
mann that these rods of idioplasm are made up 
of very definite elements of matter arranged in 
a very definite way, and that these elements 
are vital particles endowed with the properties 
of living things, including the powers of repro- 
duction and growth. He further thinks that 
they can give rise to cells, or groups of cells, 
by the mere unravelling, so to speak, of the 
parts they are composed of. The simplest of 
these compounds the author calls the " bio- 
phore." This is the primary vital unit, whose 
structure cannot be further simplified without 
destruction of its vitality. Biophores may con- 
ceivably differ as to their number of compon- 
ent molecules and as to the different kinds of 
molecules that enter into them. It is uncer- 
tain whether the biophores influence the cel- 
lular activities from within the nucleus, or mi- 
grate from the nucleus into the cell and thus 
work directly on the cell protoplasm. The bio- 
phore is further believed to be a definite en- 
tity and to have its own powers of life, growth, 
and reproduction, and to do its work through 
the aid of the cell body. The number of bio- 
phores in an animal body is further stated to 
be equal to that of the independently variable 



parts of that body, and not to the number of 
the cells of that body ; for in some cases many 
cells are so far alike that we can suppose them 
all derived from a single biophore. Thus all 
the red or white corpuscles of the human blood 
could be supposed to be derived from two bio- 
phores, while on the other hand we should need 
to assume a great number to produce all the 
different kinds of tissues of the nervous sys- 
tem. The biophore is thus regarded as a struc- 
tural unit of the lowest order, and its develop- 
ment is destined to produce all the cells of a 
given kind that enter into the composition of 
the body, and it cannot by any possibility pro- 
duce any other kind of cells. 

The second stage in Mr. Weismami's con- 
ception of the physical structure of the nuclear 
matter is the idea that the related biophores 
that is, those that are to form parts connected 
in any of many different ways are gathered 
together in the cell to form a larger unit than 
the biophore, for which the name " determi- 
nant " is employed. The determinant, with 
all its contained biophores, can divide and thus 
double the number of parts that can be de- 
rived from it. These determinants play a most 
conspicuous part in the author's theory of he- 
redity. They are the agents called in to ac- 
count for the facts in many cases. They are 
not believed to be visible by any mode of mi- 
croscopical analysis now attainable, but are 
none the less of a certain definite size. The 
fact that the nucleus can contain them all is 
sought to be accounted for by the supposition 
that they are very minute. The determinants 
are further collected into related groups called 
"ids," and these in their turn into " idants." 
The ids are large enough to be seen in the nu- 
cleus, and are the deeply staining spots, " mi- 
crosomata," that can be seen in the nuclear fil- 
aments, and these latter are called the " idants." 
The egg cell is thus seen to be a microcosm in 
which all the parts subsequently to come forth 
from it are present in such wise that the ma- 
turation of each of these preexistent parts will 
produce the adult body down to every remotest 
kind of cell. It is a part of the conception 
that the biophores are so arranged that they 
will produce all the proper cells at the correct 
time, and that these will fall, by reason of their 
position in the idant, in exactly the proper 
place, and thus all confusion be avoided. Ac- 
cording to this notion, the egg cell is the most 
complex of all the cells. In its earlier divis- 
ions we should expect that the sorting out of 
materials to form principal portions of the 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



145 



body would occur, and that later the lesser 
parts would receive attention. And this is the 
case in many instances. In some eggs the 
earliest divisions of the egg separate one half 
from all the other half of the body ; in other 
eggs all the ectoderm is separated from all the 
endoderm in the earliest segmentation. The 
development of an animal or plant can be 
stated in the terms of this hypothesis as fol- 
lows : The nuclear matter of the egg will re- 
quire to be analyzed and its parts arranged 
for distribution to the cells to be formed out 
of it. For this the centrosome or nuclear spin- 
dle exists. This, as its appearance suggests, is 
a sphere of attraction whose forces analyze the 
idants and arrange them for transmission to 
the cells to be formed. At first the cell must 
contain a very large number of different bio- 
phores, and the task of sorting them must be 
a very delicate one ; but later the cells are not 
so filled with heterologous biophores. As the 
process continues, the cells will contain fewer 
biophores, and at last only one or a few, from 
which the final forms of cells will be derivable, 
and no others. If a cell could become arrested 
before it had parted with all its biophores, it 
could subsequently at any time under certain 
conditions produce all the sorts of cells that it 
would have produced if it had not been ar- 
rested. And to press this reasoning to its 
legitimate conclusion if the egg should, be- 
fore it had developed at all, set aside one half 
of its substance to go down into the body to 
be developed from the other half, and if the 
half thus set aside should later develop in the 
same way as the first half had done, then we 
should derive from the first body a descendant 
which would be just like it, for it would in 
reality be its twin. 

This is Professor Weismann's conception, 
which he has called " The Continuity of Germ- 
Plasm "; and it is the central idea of his theory 
of heredity. The conception is not so much a 
mere abstraction as it is the only notion of the 
physical constitution of the idioplasm which is 
possible in the light of our knowledge. The 
value of an hypothesis depends on its power to 
explain facts. In this regard this one is particu- 
larly valid. Some of the proofs of this must be 
given, even at the risk of encroachment on the 
limits of our space. For example, so general 
a fact of biology as the regeneration of lost 
parts is understood in the terms of germ-plasm 
to be due to the development of biophores that 
had remained latent. Their production is con- 
sidered to be a result of natural selection, as 



they more often occur in parts where they are 
useful. The common power of fission in the 
lower orders of animals is accounted for in some- 
what the same way by supposing a duplication 
of the biophores that produce not a part but 
the whole of the body. The effect of their gen- 
eral development would be to produce two 
bodies out of one. These two modes of de- 
velopment, then, result from the further matu- 
ration of already considerably developed bio- 
phores, one producing a part only and the other 
producing an entire body. One can be con- 
ceived of readily as the phylogenetic result of 
the other. Gemmation, on the other hand, an 
equally general biological phenomenon, can be 
regarded as the result of the development of 
idants that had been arrested early in their 
course, and reserved till a later date in the 
life-history at which to come to their maturity. 
And egg development is a mode of gemmation 
in which the cell is arrested at the very outset 
of its course ; but we must note that true egg 
development includes another event, the access 
of the spermatozoon. Gemmation and egg de- 
velopment are thus seen to be modes of repro- 
duction that may have resulted from that ac- 
tion of natural selection on the idioplasm. 

But the central fact of biological science is 
variety in the midst of unity, and the evolu- 
tion of animals and plants from the simple to 
the complex. How does this theory look in 
the light of the facts of evolution ? Mere mul- 
tiplication of living things can conceivably be 
brought about through fission and gemmation ; 
and, in fact, in plants and the lower animals 
these processes have a very great deal to do 
with the operations of replenishing the earth. 
Even egg development can be parthenoge- 
netic ; that is, the unfertilized egg can, as we 
should think it ought to be able to do on our 
theory, reproduce its descendant generation, 
and the male sex is unknown for many ani- 
mals. Vacancies in the ranks of the living, 
due to the sickle of the reaper death, could 
then theoretically be made full through the 
operation of the monogamic modes of reproduc- 
tion. Why, then, does sexual development 
have any existence ? The older schools of bio- 
logical thought taught that the sexes were un- 
like in regard to the part played by the egg 
and the sperm in the egg development. Many 
ideas on this point have prevailed ; thus, some 
thought that the egg was inert, and that the 
spermatozoon was needed to energize the other- 
wise dull egg. Others thought that the sperm 
o-ave to the egg certain elements that caused 



146 



[Sept. 16, 



the variations from the racial type necessary 
for the evolution of species. Weismann differs 
from all other thinkers in holding that the egg 
and the sperm are composed of almost precisely 
identical idioplasm. I say " almost," because 
he now is inclined to think that there are slight 
differences between the two, and that the mean- 
ing of the fertilization of the egg is not to fur- 
nish a stimulus to the egg but to unite the dif- 
ferent idioplasms of the two parents so as to 
bring about a slight variation in the idioplasm 
of the offspring. Professor Weismann's theory 
accounts beautifully for the facts of heredity, 
but heretofore it has been defective on the 
other equally important side of variation. He 
has heretofore held that the germinal plasm is 
invariable ; now he modifies that view and 
states that they are not absolutely invariable, 
but that the sundry influences which play upcn 
the organism and affect the body at large play 
also to some extent on the germinal matter, 
and that these influences, while not sufficient 
to destroy the construction of the idioplasm, do 
impress slight differences on the idants strong 
enough to divert them slightly from the exact 
course of heredity. In the development of in- 
sects from unfertilized eggs there are slight de- 
viations from the maternal image ; if there were 
two variable hereditary elements there would 
be a chance for still greater divergences from 
the exact type of the parent. And he seeks to 
prove that the result of the fusion of sperm and 
egg-nucleus is a nucleus with the differences of 
both. The fertilization of the egg is thus re- 
garded as a device for the production of varia- 
tions, and it is considered to be an acquired 
character brought about in its great develop- 
ment among the higher beings through the 
operation of natural selection, by reason of the 
great advantage it conferred on its possessors. 
Considerable evidence is being collected to 
prove that this is the real meaning of this pro- 
cess, the data of which cannot be cited here. 

It will be seen that this view of the meaning 
of sexual reproduction, or " Amphimixis," 
leaves us in the same old difficulty. For it does 
not show us how the germ-plasm is caused to 
vary in the right direction and at the right 
time, so as to produce such variations as nat- 
ural selection can work on. The cases of Cope 
and the Neolamarckians are all regarded by 
Weismann as being of the utmost interest, as 
showing us probable phyletic lines ; but they 
do not prove that use can affect the structure 
of the germinal matter so as to produce an off- 
spring on which the acquired character has been 



grafted. All the alleged cases of use-inherit- 
ance are dismissed as not proved, and many 
apparent cases are shown to be errors of con- 
clusion ; so that, both on theoretical grounds 
and on the results of experiment, Weismann 
concludes that somatic variations cannot be 
transmitted. The variation of the idioplasm 
referred to as correlated with the somatic vari- 
ations is not in any sense understood by him 
as due to the results of those somatic varia- 
tions, but having occurred, they can be seized 
by natural selection. Such a view of the mat- 
ter leaves us where Darwin left us in regard 
to this point. On the side of heredity the the- 
ory is a helpful working hypothesis, and is the 
closest approximation to a clear statement on 
the question that has as yet come to us ; on the 
side of variation and the origin of species, it 
leaves us very much in the dark. The author's 
method in these essays has been progressive, 
and it is possible that he will later reach a 
clearer ground on the latter question, which is 
quite as important a biological truth as the fact 
of heredity. HENRY LESLIE OSBORN. 



THE RECONCILIATION OF HISTORY AND 
KELIGION IN CRITICISM.* 



History and religion, the claims now current un- 
der any one form of faith and the claims hitherto 
current under many forms of faith, need reconcilia- 
tion in one comprehensive statement which shall 
find its authority in the entire unfolding of human 
life. This reconciliation it is the office of sound 
criticism to accomplish ; and with it, in one way or 
another, almost all religious literature is occupied. 
It is in this relation that we mark the bearings of 
the several works before us. 

The author of " Buddhism and Christianity " de- 
fines in his preface the purpose of his work : " It 
is the contention of this work that Christ was an 
Essene monk ; that Christianity was Essenism ; and 
that Essenism was due, as Dean Mansel contended,

to the Buddhist missionaries 'who visited Egypt 
within two generations of the time of Alexander 
the Great' " (p. v. ). There is something very sur- 
prising in the attitude of the mind of the author 
toward evidence which this statement discloses. He 
unites a very light and slight estimate of the im- 
mense amount of knowledge and current convic- 
tions that has accumulated about the life of Christ 
with an extravagant and overweening sense of what 
can he done in a few pages to build up a new and 
erratic theory. Such a position promises nothing of 
any moment. Facts which need careful verifica- 
tion, wide comparison, and cautious interpretation, 
are hastily gotten together, as if they carried with 
them at once the author's opinions. The most one 
will find in this work is, here and there, a useful sug- 
gestion. 

" An Inquiry into the Truth of Dogmatic Chris- 
tianity " may be briefly characterized as an old- 
fashioned assault of unbelief on the defenses of or- 
thodoxy, defenses that rarely crumble in a degree 
proportioned to the cannonade they undergo. Time 
can alone deal adequately with them, softening them 
down and refashioning them to suit new services of 
light and life. The author has a clear, vigorous, 
unconcessive mind, and thinks himself candid, as 
doubtless in his inmost heart he intends to be. But 
his confidence in his complete victory in his trial 
of strength with the reverend archbishop of the 
most reverend church, and the still further confi- 
dence with which he throws down his gauntlet to 
all comers, show plainly that true diffidence and 
tearfulness in the higher realms of truth are far 
from him. His successes are those which usually 
attend on the well-directed blows of unbelief. A good 
deal sounds hollow under them ; some things give 
way ; but they leave in the end a barrier nearly as 
high and inaccessible as that which they first as- 
sailed. The author belongs to those who have a 
supreme confidence in the steady strokes of logic, 
thug following thug on the syllogistic anvil. This 
is seen by his definition of faith : " Faith, I con- 
ceive to be a blind reliance on the views and asser- 
tions of others, and the utter suppression of rea- 
son " (p. 28 ). Such men will see many things very 
distinctly, and many things not at all. When such 
a mind professes a desire to be convinced by an 
adversary, we seem to hear a rock exclaim : " I 
would grow excellent corn if only some one, friend 
or foe, could be found to plant it plant it deep 
in my very bosom." 

" The Newer Religious Thinking " is a good an- 
tidote to the "Inquiry." It is a fresh, popular, 
and enthusiastic presentation, in a series of sermons, 
of the vital, concessive forces of a living faith. 
Without directly touching the burden of the " In- 
quiry," it would lift it from most minds by an in- 
sensible substitution of wider, more generous, and 
more just thoughts. There would thus insensibly 
take place that most needful transformation by 
which dogma a rock-like wall of ice dissolves 
away, becomes a running stream, and once more 



carries with it all the processes of life. This work 
brings courage and hope to the reader, and makes 
the world seem, what it truly is, an unfolding 
grace beyond grace, knowledge beyond knowledge 
of the divine mind. We escape the distress of 
finding things completely wrong now, and also the 
greater distress the absolute hopelessness of being 
able to make them right hereafter. It is wonder- 
ful that evolution should not seem to those who so 
readily entertain it a profound justification of the 
past as well as a limitless promise of the future. 

" Christ and Criticism " aims, as its primary pur- 
pose, to set forth " how far the authority of Jesus 
Christ should properly be allowed to modify, or to 
regulate, the process of Biblical criticism " (p. iv. ). 
The book is clear, candid, and concise. It considers 
somewhat at length the theory of Kuenen and others 
of the comparatively recent origin of the Jewish rit- 
ual, and is well fitted to make the mind more cau- 
tious in its critical essays. This, indeed, seems to be 
its chief value. There is a boldness, not to say rash- 
ness, about Biblical criticism that goes far to unhinge 
the mind, to destroy the criticism itself in common 
with all conclusions concerning the sacred record. 
More weight must be attached to existing conclu- 
sions, to historical testimony, to the slow determin- 
ation of opinions and events by the ages themselves 
in which they have been shaped, or there is no suf- 
ficient basis for criticism. Criticism that pulls to 
pieces with perfect freedom its subject-matter can 
only leave behind it disjecta membra. Its own pos- 
itive results will be far too weak to command respect 
in presence of the genei'al unbelief it has awakened. 
Weight is the universal condition of solid work. 
To show no reverence is to command no reverence. 
Criticism can create nothing, and it must therefore 
use sparingly and respectfully the material provided 
for it. The renewing of this impression seems to 
us the better purpose and result of the present work. 

To bring the testimony of Christ in a direct way to 
the support of any theory of interpretation is not so 
easy as the reverent mind regards it. The method 
implies a universality in the words of Christ, the 
full force of the thousand implications involved 
in his immediate purpose, that make of his teach- 
ings, not simply a seed-bed, but the entire harvest 
of later years. Thus, again and again, from the 
silence of Christ, or from an act, or from an asser- 
tion of his, having wholly other ends in view, there 
have been drawn conclusions wherewith to check 
the moral and spiritual growth of the world. We 
cannot enuecleate our spiritual world in its entirety 
from the teachings of Christ. His words are of 
most value when they are allowed to flow most freely 
into our words ; when they are united most imme- 
diately and vitally with their own conditions. As 
a section of the river, a chapter in the book, they 
come forward to us in a far more effective way 
than when we undertake to regard them as a gen- 
eral synopsis of all truth. 

" Verbum Dei " expresses in its title the prevail- 
ing idea of the volume. The author, addressing

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



young men in preparation for the ministry, returns, 
under many forms of expression, to the supreme 
consideration that they must deliver a message 
which they have received from God. The author 
is plainly sincere and earnest in his exhortation, 
and will receive the hearty approval of the ordin- 
arily devout mind. An important truth lies back 
of the enforcement the need in one's calling of a 
simple, devout, and devoted spirit; but the exhor- 
tation, as the author puts it, seems to us tainted 
with presumption, mysticism, pietism. The aver- 
age young man, instead of finding in it a guide to 
sincere and wise effort, might readily fall, by means 
of it, into an unctuous and dogmatic temper entirely 
alien to the intention of the writer. He states as 
his theme : " Every living preacher must receive 
his message in a communication direct from God, 
and the constant purpose of his life must be to re- 
ceive it uncorrupted, and to deliver it without addi- 
tion or subtraction " (p. 17). Farther expressions 
of the same thought are : " Language may be fei-- 
tilizing as well as charming if the tide of God is in 
it." " Thus saith the Lord, tacitly introduces all 
that he teaches." " An utterance from the deep 
cell of immediate revelation." " Is the word of 
God in it authenticate and immediate and real? " 
" He is to climb Sinai with its ring-fence of death, 
and on the summit speak face to face with Him 
whom no one can see and yet live." These senti- 
ments, taken from the first lecture, are enforced 
in the lectures which follow, chiefly by a consid- 
eration of the character of the Bible and of the 
need of its study. One lecture is entitled, "The 
Word of God Outside the Bible." In this there is 
a passing mention of science, but no mention of 
those large and urgent questions which touch the 
relations of men to each other. Is there not here 
a profound mistake on the part of the lecturer, in 
spite of his earnest and liberal temper ? Has any 
young man any right to put his opinions, whatever 
they may be, first upon God and then upon his fel- 
low-men, as ultimate truths ? Does not this idea 
rest with its entire weight on the dogmatism of the 
past ? Is a young man likely to find a simple and 
modest message and a true work in this way ? How 
shall he attain the earnest, consecrated, and also 
wise temper, which the times and all times demand, 
otherwise than by a daily inquiry into that very 
theme, overlooked by the lecturer, Sociology the 
coming of the Kingdom of Heaven, here and now, 
among men ? It seems to us a great wrong to the 
Bible to magnify it in this way, and at the same 
time to separate it from its most immediate work, 
the redemption of society. What young men su- 
premely need is an earnest spirit in working with 
men for men, in all lower and higher ways ; and 
this spirit must ever arise in immediate view of the 
wants of men. We have no patience with a super- 
naturalism that blinds a man to the spiritual world 
he lives in. 

"The Gospel and its Earliest Interpretations " is 
a work well and clearly conceived, and executed with 



fulness and care. Only a rigid notion of inspira- 
tion can hide from us the diversity of outlook in 
different portions of the New Testament ; and the 
artificial harmony we secure by our narrow render- 
ings is attended by grave losses. Our fellowship 
with each writer will be stimulating in the degree 
in which it is free. The foreground is assigned in 
this book to the words of Christ ; these are followed 
by the view of his life given by his more immediate 
Jewish disciples ; then come what the author terms 
the Pauline transformation and the secondary kin- 
dred transformation, of which the Epistle to the 
Hebrews offers the most marked example. These 
are followed by the Johannine, the anti-gnostic, and 
the Apocalyptic interpretations. That there is ground 
for distinguishing all these phases of thought many 
would readily admit ; and also that, in tracing these 
distinctions, we come to a much better and broader 
understanding of the very wide-reaching problem of 
the formation of Christian faith. We think, how- 
ever, that the process of discrimination, once en- 
tered on, readily suffers exaggeration. The truth 
is that diverse things and contradictory things can 
be said and done by the same person, and still carry 
with them very little real division of thought. The 
religious world has suffered immensely, both in ac- 
tion and in interpretation, by magnifying wholly 
secondary distinctions. In discussions of this chai 1 - 
acter, questions of authenticity and of interpreta- 
tion are allowed to flow into each other too readily. 
The first set of inquiries are far less facile than the 
second. We can interpret safely only when the 
shore-marks of the text are well defined for us, and 
we are not allowed to determine its authenticity by 
the exigencies of our theory in rendering its words. 
If it is true, however, that the critic is especially 
tempted to magnify differences, it is still more true 
that the general reader of the New Testament 
greatly obscures them. A very important service 
is rendered by a work like the present in restoring 
local color to the various writings of the New Tes- 
tament. 

The last volume on our list is "Theosophy, or 
Psychological Religion." No English author has 
done more than its author, Max Mliller, to identify 
the necessary steps of development in religious truth 
with the historical growth of religions. The two 
are essentially one. Whatever religion may owe to 
the superior insight of gifted minds, to a revelation 
of which they are made the prophets and apostles 
( and it owes very much to these personal points of 
light), none the less, the real test of religious truth. 
that by which it has been for the time being 
saved, and later passed on as a permanent term in 
the development of the race, has been its hold, as 
an actual faith, on the minds of men. In discuss- 
ing, therefore, the fundamental conceptions of the 
various religions of the world, and the manner in 
which they prepare the way for, support, and sup- 
plement each other, we come, as we cannot other- 
wise come, both at the order of religious develop- 
ment and at the tremendous weight of proof which 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

attaches to the truths reached along this line of 
race-unfolding. Skepticism is impossible if we truly 
see and feel that these primary spiritual principles 
are really the product of all the reason of the world, 
acting both instinctively and rationally, individu- 
ally and in all men collectively. The present vol- 
ume is another most significant contribution in this 
same direction. " These lectures contain the key 
to the whole series, and they formed from the very 
beginning my final aim. They are meant as the 
coping-stone of the arch that rests on the two pil- 
lars of Physical and Anthropological Religion, and 
unites the two into the true gate of the temple of 
the religion of the future. They are to show that 
from a purely historical point of view Christianity 
is not a mere continuation or even reform of Juda- 
ism, but that, particularly in its theology or theos- 
ophy, it represents a synthesis of Semitic and Aryan 
thought which forms its real strength and its power 
of satisfying not only the requirements of the heart, 
but likewise the postulates of reason." (Preface, 
viii.). These lectures, with much incidental dis- 
cussion, cover a wide field in oriental and Grecian 
eschatology and theosophy, and gather their con- 
clusions together in connection with the church at 
Alexandria and with the mysticism of Mediaeval 
Christianity. A careful perusal of a book of this 
order becomes an immediate requisite of every stu- 
dent who is striving, at least in his own thought, to 
unite history and religion in one universal develop- 
ment ; to make criticism subserve its real purpose 
of uniting and consolidating all truth.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Hunting on the 
Western plains 
and mountains. 



Mr. Theodore Roosevelt's " The Wil- 



derness Hunter " (Putnam ), a rather 
sumptuous volume, profusely illus- 
trated, is largely a narrative of the author's hunt- 
ing experiences on and about his ranch on the Little 
Missouri, and in the outlying mountainous region 
of western Montana and northwestern Wyoming. 
The business of " ranching " has, for some occult 
reason, a special charm for the gilded youth of the 
Eastern States ; and Mr. Roosevelt seems to have 
followed it, in a gentleman-amateurish sort of way, 
for some years before his fancy led him into the 
more precarious paths of politics. During these 
years, he tells us, he " hunted much, among the 
mountains and on the plains, both as a pastime and 
to procure hides, meat, and robes for use on the 
ranch ; and it was my good luck to kill all the va- 
rious kinds of large game that can properly be con- 
sidered to belong to, temperate North America." 
No one, after reading Mr. Roosevelt's books, will 
question his claim to having wrought a great deal of 
havoc in the animal world. Bison, moose, elk, deer, 
caribou, etc., have fallen in great numbers before 
his conquering rifle. It is fair to say, too, that he 
has carried on his warfare against the " native 



burghers " of forest and plain, with some shadow 
of justifiable end, and with a nice regard to the 
dictates of the sportsman's code. No single elk, 
deer, bison, or other victim on Mr. Roosevelt's list, 
has had reason, so far as we can discern, to com- 
plain that it was killed in other than a thoroughly 
sportsmanlike way a fact equally soothing, doubt- 
less, to both parties to the transaction. But it is 
not our purpose to chop morals with our author on 
the point indicated. The book is thoroughly read- 
able, and it contains, aside from matter of mere en- 
tertainment, much that should prove of practical 
value to the sportsman and of interest to the na- 
turalist. 

Mr. Nestor Ponce de Leon ( No. 40 

Two new volumes , __ -, . f,.. C*. , ., 

of Columbus Broadway, New York City) is both 

author and publisher of two well- 
printed and profusely-illustrated volumes of Co- 
lumbus literature " The Columbus Gallery " and 
"The Caravels of Columbus." The former con- 
tains an account of the portraits, monuments, stat- 
ues, medals, and paintings of Christopher Columbus 
now in existence in various countries. Its illus- 
trations are of course an important feature, and 
make of it a timely and useful volume. The sec- 
ond work, " The Caravels of Columbus," contains 
full descriptions, compiled from original documents, 
of the vessels selected by Columbus and by the 
brothers Pinzon. The author describes every de- 
tail of the famous caravels, and shows that they 
were stanch ships, properly fitted up ; but when he 
says they were " greatly superior to those dragons 
in which the Normans [Norsemen] made wonder- 
ful voyages through frozen and ice-packed seas, dis- 
covering and colonizing Iceland, Greenland, and the 
northern part of America, 500 years before the suc- 
cessful enterprise of Columbus," we must refer him 
to the Viking ship which has lately sailed across 
the Atlantic and is now on exhibition at the Co- 
lumbian Exposition. The grotesque caravels are 
mere tubs as compared with the picturesque Viking 
ship, and can in no wise be compared with the lat- 
ter in seagoing qualities. In the art of shipbuild- 
ing the Norsemen were farther advanced in the 
tenth century than the navigators of Spain or Por- 
tugal in the fifteenth. This criticism does not, of 
course, impugn the general accuracy of Mr. Ponce 
de Leon's work, which is in the main to be heartily 
commended. 

In a little book on " The Secret of 
The Secret of Character Building" (Griggs), by 
"' John DeMotte, we have the attempt 
of a religious nature to provide a scientific explana- 
tion and authorization for a theory of morals and 
religion.. That what, is called the spiritual life has 
its basis in sensation and nerve-structure is a fact 
that religious people are too apt to overlook, and 
one which our author does well to emphasize. The 
tedious process of eradicating bad habits (or nerve- 
tracks leading upon stimulation to vicious action), 
and of establishing good ones, is necessary before

the higher life can be considered a stable possession. 
In the words (and capitals) of the book: "The 
Physical Basis of a virtuous life is a network of 
Trunk Lines, where the incoming waves of stimu- 
lation, on reaching the cerebral hemispheres of the 
brain, find there well-worn tracks, with switches 
already set, leading to the God-given higher posses- 
sions of the Soul holy memories, pure imagina- 
tions, consecrated ambitions, righteous judgments, 
and a Will whose nerve connection with these 
higher faculties is so perfect that at once, unless 
the line of duty presents complications requiring 
consideration, the commands for right conduct are 
flashed out through the outgoing nerve tracks, and 
instantly obeyed." Despite a slight confusion in 
the author's thought and metaphor, and a little 
more parade of science than was necessary for the 
enforcement of his thesis, he rightly concludes that 
a sudden conversion, to secure a man from falling, 
must be reinforced by patient continuance in well- 
doing, that young converts need much more helpful 
care and attention than they receive, and that it is 
much better and easier to learn right habits at the 
outset than to sow wild oats now and rely upon 
making all right by " getting religion " later on. 
It is possible to cease from vicious action, but the 
traces of it and the tendency to it always remain a 
part of the physical basis of character. One can 
pull out the nail ; one cannot pull out the nail- 
hole. "This book is the expressed conviction of 
the writer that we shall never build the highest 
types of Christian character until society feels a 
deeper concern for the establishment in youth of 
none but sound nerve-tracks in moral areas." 



We welcome Ernest Redwood's 

A French protest . i,, /T-II\I 

against Material- translation of " Youth (Dodd),by 
nce - Charles Wagner, as an evidence that 
Americans are beginning to realize that not all 
Frenchmen are flippant and licentious, and are be- 
ginning to take an interest in the serious thought of 
France. The original book has aroused wide atten- 
tion as one sign of a healthy reaction in France 
against the prevalent materialism, utilitarianism, 
realism, naturalism. Wagner points out the dan- 
gers of exclusive devotion to positive science belit- 
tling man in his own eyes, to the neglect of charac- 
ter, culture, and training, and the dangers of that ex- 
treme centralization which has given us our mon- 
ster cities with pauperism on the one hand and lux- 
ury on the other. All that is evil in these things 
is opposed to the modern spirit, which he defines as 
the " sum total of the best which man has derived 
from all the mighty labors and sufferings of the 
past." It is fairmindedness and breadth of view, 
or the true scientific spirit ; it is kindness and jus- 
tice, or the true humanitarian spirit ; it is solidar- 
ity and altruism, or the true socialistic spirit. 
Man's success, during the past century, in construct- 
ing the machinery of a vast material civilization 
has been splendid, but man himself is a failure. 
He is overdriven and crushed by the Juggernaut he

has made. It is useless, or worse than useless, to 
master the material forces of the universe if we can- 
not master ourselves. Man is the basis of all civ- 
ilization, and it is because man is weak that our 
civilization threatens to crumble and fall about our 
heads. To regain strength, our youth must return 
to normal thinking and normal living, to rever- 
ence, to belief in something, to a feeling of responsi- 
bility, to work, to chastity, to simplicity, to joy- 
ousness, and where possible to country life, to 
communion with nature. Such are some of the 
points eloquently set forth in this very readable 
book. 

In his " The Ancient Ways : Win- 

. * 

chester Fifty Years Ago" (Macmil- 

jv^ th(j ^ w Tuckwel}? an old 

Winchester boy, gives a lively picture of his life as 
a pupil at that venerable foundation. In reading 
this account of Winchester school one scarcely knows 
which to wonder at most the barbarity of the 
boys, the indifference to it of the masters, the prac- 
tical futility of the curriculum, or the affectionate 
way in which the Rev. Mr. Tuckwell seems to look 
back upon it all. The abominable custom of " fag- 
ging " which makes the smaller boy the lawful 
drudge and victim of the larger flourished in es- 
pecial vigor at Winchester. The author himself 
suffered grievously therefrom in mind and in body, 
if not in estate ; and he feelingly heads a chapter 
on the subject with the familiar third line of the 
Second Book of the ^neid. As to the school-work, 
he says, " We were ' suckled on Latin and weaned 
on Greek '; little else was cared for." Fifteen hours 
a week were given to Latin composition not to 
translating into Latin, but to "original" composi- 
tion on a given theme. An incredible amount of 
Latin was learned by heart, and once a year the 
boys were publicly tested as to their proficiency in 
this useful accomplishment. On these occasions 
" the lines were said in eight lessons "; and once, as 
the author records, a pupil "took up 2,000 lines a les- 
son, 16,000 lines in all " a parrot-like feat which 
seems to have afforded the examiners much satis- 
faction. A mild feint was made at French and 
German, mathematics did not even count in the 
school marks, and the fact that " very rarely in- 
deed a theme was given for English writing" is not 
altogether unattested in Mr. Tuckwell's own style. 
In short, any branch remotely savoring of utility 
was severely frowned down at Winchester, and the 
pupil of the period left school, we opine, with the 
mental equipment of a mediaeval monk, and about 
as fit as Caspar Hauser for the real activities of life. 

It is high commendation to say that 

An appreciative _ / 

and judicial Mr. O Connor Morris, in adding an- 

life of Napoleon. Qther Ufe rf Napoleon to the multi- 

tude ("Heroes of the Nations" series, Putnam), 
has not been carrying coals to Newcastle. He has 
made a valuable book, in which the ever-fascinating 
narrative of that wonderful life is told again with 
appreciation yet with calm judgment. The fact

that Napoleon, like other men, grew under the in- 
fluences of his circumstances is " too little recog- 
nized, although such recognition is necessary to any 
sane estimate of the man. Mr. Morris here em- 
phasizes it. The genius of the soldier and general 
is conceded by all, but we are here led to behold 
also the consummate ability of the administrator. 
This latest biographer, however, has to confess that 
Napoleon was not a great statesman, that while 
his domestic policy bore many rich and beneficent 
fruits, it was the policy of a beneficent despot, and 
that his imperial plans were the outcome of an in- 
ability to account for nationality and of an ambi- 
tion which was seldom in touch with the practical. 
It must be conceded, however, by the careful stu- 
dent of history, that much in the career of Napo- 
leon was the result of forces he did not control. 
When he came to the front, already had the wars 
of the Revolution period engendered a universal 
European distrust of French ambition, and already 
were the hostile forces of a world gathered around 
his camps. He could not go backward, and every 
step forward led but to a final Waterloo. No bet- 
ter summing up of Napoleon's policy and charac- 
ter, and of his contribution to history, has ever been 
written than the last chapter of this book, which we 
commend to all students of the career of the man 
of destiny. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FAJLL, BOOKS. 



In presenting our annual list of books that are an- 
nounced for the coining Fall and Winter by American 
publishers, those principles of classification and arrange- 
ment have been followed that have in the past been 
found most convenient and helpful to our readers. The 
division into departments of literature, obviously of 
much practical advantage, has been attended with no 
little difficulty, owing to the meagre information some- 
times furnished us ; and if an occasional book is wrongly 
classified, the error is due to this cause alone. We be- 
lieve, however, that few such errors have occurred, and 
that the list as a whole will prove as trustworthy as it 
is instructive. Some suggestive comments upon it will 
be found in the leading editorial article in this number 
of THE DIAL.

LITERARY XOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



The Independent Theatre of London has issued its 
programme for the coming season. It includes Herr 
Strindberg's "The Father," Dr. Ibsen's "The Wild 
Duck," and a comedy by M. Zola. 

" The Sewanee Review," which has recently com- 
pleted its first year, will hereafter be conducted by Pro- 
fessor W. P. Trent, author of the life of Simms in the 
" American Men of Letters " series. 

The New York Shakespeare Society has begun to re- 
print in its " Bankside " edition the archaic texts of the 
seventeen plays first printed in the Heminges and Con- 
dell Folio of 1623. The first of these plays, " The Tem- 
pest," will leave the press in a few days. Of these new 
volumes but 500 copies are printed. 

Germany has been having a Congress of Authors, the 
place of meeting being at Munich. The principal ques- 
tion discussed was the reform of the law of literary 
property, with especial reference to the copyright treaty 
between Germany and the United States, which is re- 
garded as very unfavorable to the former. A committee 
was appointed to prepare a memorial on this subject, to 
be submitted to the Imperial Government and to be laid

before the Reichstag. The Convention adjourned to 
meet next year in Hamburg. 

An English publisher writes to " The Author " to put 
on record a novel experience. " This morning's post," 
he says, "brings an unasked-for and most acceptable 
cheque towards recouping publishers' losses from one 
whose book a really good book that was much praised 
failed to ' catch on.' I want to place on record that 
this is onr first and only experience of the kind." 

An extraordinary decision is reported from the French 
courts. The newsdealing firm of Messrs. Brentano's in 
Paris was sued for having placed on sale a New York 
newspaper wherein was contained a libellous article 
upon a former minister of France to Hayti. The court 
decided that the offending firm should pay both costs 
and heavy damages, as well as the expense of inserting 
the judgment in a number of journals. Such a decision 
as this must place the English booksellers of Paris in 
a very peculiar predicament. If they are to be held 
responsible for the contents of all the newspapers they 
offer for sale, they may as well retire from business. 

On November 8, Dr. Theodor Mommsen will cele- 
brate his fifty years' " Doktorjubilaum" A great num- 
ber of the friends and admirers of the eminent scholar 
are of opinion that the day should be marked by some 
substantial acknowledgement of his epoch-making work. 
They have resolved to collect a sum of money, and pre- 
sent it to the historian on the day of his jubilee as doc- 
tor, in order that he may found a " Stiftung " for the 
promotion of scientific studies in his own branch of la- 
bor, the arrangement of the character and statutes of 
this " Mommsen-fund " being left to his discretion. 
Foreign scholars and friends who wish to subscribe may 
remit to Ludwig Delbriick, 61, Mauerstrasse, Berlin. 

ENGLISH VIEWS OF THE AUTHORS' CONGRESS. 

The London " Times " of recent date contained an 
extended article on the Authors' Congress at Chicago, 
written by Mr. Walter Besant, who, as is well known, 
was an active and influential member. He found the 
Congress " a truly representative meeting," and " the 
papers produced were written by those whose experi- 
ence in the subjects treated and whose position in the 
world of letters entitled them at least to a respectful 
hearing." The most quotable portions of the article 
are those addressed particularly to certain comments 
on the Congress by that somewhat witty caviller Mr. 
Andrew Lang and that somewhat wearisome caviller 
Mr. Robert Buchanan. Referring to the former gen- 
tleman, Mr. Besant pointedly says: 

" What is the good of holding such a Conference ? 
A certain English man of letters has asked this ques- 
tion, adding, as his answer, that an author has nothing 
to do but to sell his wares and have done with it. But 
suppose he will not sell his wares and so have done with 
it. Suppose he understands what many men of let- 
ters seem totally unable to understand that his wares 
may represent a considerable, even a great property, 
which is going to yield a steady return for many years; 
that he ought no more to sell this property ' and have 
done with it ' than he would sell a rich mine, or a mill, 
or a row of houses, and have done with it, unless for a 
consideration based on business principles. To such as 
understand this axiom t. e., to all who are concerned 
in the material interests of literature such a Confer- 
ence may prove of the greatest possible use. 

" For instance, among the questions to be considered 
were, (1) all those relating to copyright, international 



and domestic; (2) all those which relate to the admin- 
istration of literary property; (3) all those which are 
concerned with literature itself its past, its present, 
its tendency. ... It is manifest that the first two 
branches may be most important to those concerned 
with literary property too often anyone but the pro- 
ducer and creator of it. There is, however, another 
point. It is greatly to be desired that those who be- 
long to the literary profession should from time to time 
gather together and recognise the fact that they do be- 
long to a common calling. Hitherto the author, though 
he calls himself a man of letters, has been too apt to 
refuse the recognition of a profession or calling of let- 
ters. He has sat apart alone ; nay, in many cases his 
only recognition of his brethren has been a cheap sneer 
or a savage gibe. To this day there remain a few of 
those of whom Churchill wrote, who can never speak 
of their brethren but with bitterness or derision. Such 
a man at such a Conference is out of place ; much more 
important, his very existence comes to be recognised as 
an anachronism: he will no longer be tolerated." 

Mr. Lang's rather captious question, " How can a 
hundred Congresses at Chicago secure the conditions " 
of independence for the author, is thus answered in an- 
other place: 

" The author's independence will be secured for him 
from the moment that his pay the commercial side of 
his work is put, once for all, on such a footing of re- 
cognized terms and proportions as will make him abso- 
lutely independent of the publisher and dependent solely 
on the public, as a physician, or a barrister, or an archi- 
tect, or a solicitor, is independent. This can be done, 
and will be done, by the arrival at an understanding be- 
tween honorable publishers and leading writers. What- 
ever understanding this may be, it must rest upon the 
basis of the demand for a book by the public. Our ef- 
forts have been all along directed to showing the liter- 
ary profession the meaning of their property so that 
they may see the necessity of coming to such an under- 
standing." 

Mr. Besant expresses the hope that when next an 
Author's Congress, or Conference, is held, Mr. Lang 
will be there to see. Mr. Buchanan, however, who " does 
his little best to darken counsel by prating foolishness 
about Literature and Lucre," Mr. Besant hopes and 
trusts " will not be present." The " literature and lu- 
cre " argument is thus treated : 

" Another kind of literary man is he who is continu- 
ally inveighing against the baseness of connecting liter- 
ature with lucre. He appears in this country, on an 
average, once a year, with his stale and conventional 
rubbish. Where this kind of talk is sincere, if ever it 
is sincere mostly it comes from those who have failed 
to connect literature with lucre it rests upon a con- 
fusion of ideas. That is to say, it confuses the intellec- 
tual, artistic, literary worth of a book with its com- 
mercial value. But the former is one thing, the latter 
is another. They are not commensurable. The former 
has no value which can be expressed in guineas any 
more than the beauty of a sunset or the colours of a 
rainbow. The latter may be taken as a measure of the 
popular taste, which should, but does not always, de- 
mand the best books. No one, therefore, must con- 
sider that a book necessarily fails because the demand 
for it is small; nor, on the other hand, is it always just 
or useful to deride the author of a successful book be- 
cause it is successful. In the latter case the author has 
perhaps done his best; it is the popular judgment that 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



should be reproved and the popular taste which should 
be led into a truer way. 

" A book, rightly or wrongly, then, may be a thing 
worth money a property, an estate. It is the author's 
property unless he signs it away; and since any book, 
in the uncertainty of the popular judgment, may be- 
come a valuable property, it is the author's part to safe- 
guard his property, and not to part with it without due 
consideration and consultation with those who have con- 
sidered the problem. And it is the special function of 
such a Conference to lay down the data of the problem, 
and so to help in producing, if possible, a solution. But 
as for the question is it sordid, is it base, for an au- 
thor a genius to look after money ? Well, a pop- 
ular author is not always a genius. But even those who 
are admitted to have some claim to the possession of 
genius have generally been very careful indeed with re- 
gard to the money produced by their writings. Scott, 
Byron, Moore, Dickens, George Eliot, Thackeray, Trol- 
lope, Tennyson, Wilkie Collins, Charles Reade, almost 
every man or woman of real distinction in letters-, can 
be shown to have been most careful about the money 
side of his books. It is left for the unsuccessful, for 
the shallow pretenders, or for some shady publisher's 
hack, to cry out upon the degradation of letters when 
an author is advised to look after his property. Let us 
simply reply that what has not degraded the illustrious 
men who have gone before will not degrade those smaller 
men, their successors." 

Elsewhere in this interesting article, Mr. Besant in- 
dulges in some optimistic observations on what he terms 
the "new Literature of the West": 

"The Congress of Literature was held at Chicago at 
a fitting moment. It may be taken as the inauguration 
of a new Literature which has just begun to spring up 
in the West; a Literature of which I for one was pro- 
foundly ignorant until I learned about it on the spot. 
At present it exists chiefly in promise; but if it is a 
bantling, it is a vigorous bantling. In what direction 
this new Literature of the West will develop it would 
be quite impossible, even for one who knows the condi- 
tions of Western life, to predict. Enough to place on 
record for the moment, the fact that there has sprung 
into existence during the last year or two a company of 
new writers wholly belonging to the West. All over 
the broad valley of the Mississippi and on the Western 
prairies there are farmers in vast numbers living for 
the most part in solitary homesteads; their chief re- 
creation is reading; there are also small towns and vil- 
lages by the thousand; places whose population is be- 
tween one and two thousand, in every one of which will 
be found a ladies' literary society and a library. The 
former holds meetings, receives papers, and is, gener- 
ally, a centre of a certain intellectual activity; for the 
latter, the ladies who manage it endeavor to procure as 
many new books as possible." 



OLD STANZAS WORTH REPRINTING. 
Thousands of visitors to Chicago this summer, and 
other thousands of our citizens, have noticed, in passing 
and repassing by railroad between the city and the Fair 
grounds, the fine group of bronze statuary standing near 
the lake front at Eighteenth street, on the line of the 
Illinois Central Railroad. This group, the work of 
Mr. Carl Rohl-Smith, a Danish sculptor who won dis- 
tinction by his statue of Franklin that adorns the en- 
trance to the Electricity Building at the Fair, was erected 
through the generosity of Mr. George M. Pullman, 



as a memorial to mark the spot of the Indian massacre 
at Chicago in 1812, when the garrison of Fort Dear- 
born, having evacuated the fort and started to march 
to Detroit, was attacked after marching a few miles 
and nearty exterminated. The dedication of the mon- 
ument was naturally the occasion of a considerable out- 
pouring of commemorative verse, some of the best of 
which is given a place in Major Kirkland's very read- 
able history of the massacre, lately published by Messrs. 
Dibble & Co. To our mind, however, by far the best 
verses on this theme are those written twenty years ago 
by that brilliant Western poet, Benjamin F. Taylor, and 
first published in " The Lakeside Monthly " for Octo- 
ber, 1873. We subjoin the stanzas referred to: 
" Born of the prairie and the wave, the blue sea and the green, 
A city of the Occident, Chicago lay between ; 
Dim trails upon the meadow, faint wakes upon the main, 
On either sea a schooner and a canvas-covered wain. 

" I saw a dot upon the map, and a house-fly's filmy wing 
They said 't was Dearborn's picket-flag when Wilderness was 

king; 
I heard the reed-bird's morning song the Indian's awkward 

flail 

The rice tattoo in his rude canoe like a dash of April hail, 
The beaded grasses' rustling bend the swash of the lazy tide, 
Where ships shake out their salted sails and navies grandly 

ride! 
" I heard the Block-house gates unbar, the column's solemn 

tread, 

I saw the Tree of a single leaf its splendid foilage shed 
To wave awhile that August morn above the column's head ; 
I heard the moan of muffled drum, the woman's wail of fife, 
The Dead March played for Dearborn's men just marching 

out of life, 

The swooping of the savage cloud that burst upon the rank 
And struck it with its thunderbolt in forehead and in flank, 
The spatter of the musket-shot, the rifles' whistling rain, 
The sand-hills drift round hope forlorn that never marched 

again ! "

This is an authentic history of the Mississippi Valley from its earliest 
exploration and settlement by the French until the final surrender of 
llliiiois to the English in 1765, and of Louisiana to the Spaniards in 
1769, together with a concise account of the English sway in Illinois till 
1778. It includes many biographical and character sketches of the 
early explorers and notices of the settlement and prog ress of many of 
the towns and villages founded by the French in Canada and the Val- 
ley of the Mississippi. 

LIFE OF GENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS. 

By Col. DONN PIATT. With concluding chapters by Genl. 

H. V. BOYNTON. Portrait. 8vo, cloth, $3.00, net. 

Written in Colonel Piatt's well-known trenchant style, and is doubt- 
less the most incisive of all his war criticisms. It presents at every 
step the movement of other armies, and will interest the admirers of 
other leading generals and lead to much discussion. Genl. Boynton 
has finished the chapters relating to the Atlanta and Nashville Cam- 
paigns, Genl. J. H. Wilson's wonderful cavalry expedition, etc., with 
an outline of Genl. Thomas's career after the war.

and Views. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

An accurate account of Piatt's varied public services as a journalist, 
jurist, diplomat, soldier, politician, and author. It is enlivened by 
numerous incidents, illustrating his sense of humor, brilliant wit, 
crushing, remorseless sarcasm, cogent method of reasoning, and epi- 
grammatic force of expression.

EASTWARD TO THE LAND OF THE MORNING. 

By M. M. SHOEMAKER. Illustrated 12rao, cloth, $1.25. 
This is an unusually readable book. Mr. Shoemaker not only knows 
what to see, but how to describe what he sees better than nine travel- 
lers out of ten, whose observations get into print. We have not for a 
long time read a descriptive book which so set before us and lights up 
to view the scenes in hand. Literary World, Boston.

est on account of the originality of its thought and outline and the 
clearness of his statements.

A Syllabus of Psychology. 

By WILLIAM M. BRYANT, author of "World Energy and 
its Self-Conservation." Second edition, paper, 25 cents. 
"The most immature student will not find it difficult to grasp the 
propositions laid down, and the Syllabus gives an entirely adequate out- 
line of the fundamentals of psychology. The list of books given at the 
close is brief, but forms a sufficient and admirable course of study." 
Neio York Evangelist. 

The Secret of Character Building. 

By JOHN DE MOTTK, A.M., Ph.D. Cloth, illustrated, $1.00. 
"Readers will here meet with a genuine surprise. The author finds 
a novel opportunity in physiological psychology for a more complete 
ethical training. The book is decidedly unique. With the pedagogic 
instinct of a Luther the author considers it not only easier but more 
profitable to try to form a new character than to reform a depraved 
one. In this work he lias given clear and beautiful expression in popu- 
lar form to profound scientific truth supporting his convictions." 
Edgar Dubs Shimer, University of City of New York, in Educational 
Review. 

Poetry and Philosophy of Goethe. 

Edited by MARION V. DUDLEY. Cloth, $1.50. 
"We have read many works on Goethe, but never one which has 
thrown so much light upon his character, philosophy, and poetry as 
this volume. The many sides from which he is reviewed, the familiar 
character of the discussions, often colloquial, and those conducted by 
specialists in the study of his writings, furnish the reader with a mass 
of information of profound interest and rare value. The discussions 
contain a freshness and force, a flavor and freedom which awakens and 
retains the attention of the reader. To any one who would understand 
Goethe as a man, thinker, and writer, we commend this volume as the 
best with which we are acquainted." The National Baptist, Philadel- 
phia. 

A Study of Greek Philosophy. 

By ELLEN M. MITCHELL. With an Introduction by WILLIAM 

ROUNSEVILLE ALGER. Cloth, $1.25. 

" This survey, with its analysis of the Greek schools, is the most clear 
and inclusive, as far as my knowledge extends, that has been made in 
our language within so compact a space. It is of genuine value." 
Edmund Clarence Stedman. 

" It is the best work for general students we have ever read. It is a 
popular treatise in which we find most charmingly presented a discus- 
sion of the various schools of Greek thought, with biographical repre- 
sentatives from Thales to Proclus. In this brilliant volume the reader 
is introduced to such master minds as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, 
and Epicurus. It is clear, crisp, compact. To those who have a taste 
for philosophy we can heartily recommend this admirable volume." 
The Arena, Boston, Mass. 

England and Its Rulers. 

A Concise Compendium of the History of England and Its

"This will prove a reliable, helpful book for ready reference to the 
main facts of English Royal, Constitutional, and Church history. It is a 
well chosen, well arranged piece of compiling. The indexing is thor- 
oughly done, especially in biography." Review of Reviews, New York.

it a mine of wealth, full of practical suggestions and 
directions of great value, while the general reader will 
be fascinated by the gems of thought, the vivid por- 
traitures and sparkling anecdotes of celebrated orators 
with which its pages abound. 

From the New York Mail and Express : " This book should be read, 
marked, and inwardly digested by every young man who expects at any 
time to speak in public, either at a public meeting, in a deliberative 
body, at the bar, in the pulpit, or even after dinner." 

From the Philadelphia Inquirer : " No better idea of the great ora- 
tors whose names are in all men's mouths can be found than from Dr. 
Mathews's glowing pages. It is impossible to read them without gath- 
ering new ideas and increasing knowledge while it is equally impossible 
to miss being entertained."

THE ROSENTHAL METHOD OF 
PRACTICAL LINQUISTRY, 

has just been issued by him, which does not only super- 
sede his former system, published twenty years ago, but 
will be found superior to any method. It is the ma- 
ture outcome of twenty-five years' experience of the 
greatest linguist and foremost teacher of the age, en- 
abling anyone to learn to

240 pages, $1.00. 

A clear and systematic treatment of the fundamental notions and

sophical terms of current value, and in the discussion of axioms full 
use is made of recent mathematical investigations into the nature of 
space, etc. The unique value of the book is derived from the fact that 
it is the first popular compendium of monistic positivism that has ever

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



General Johnston. 

By ROBERT M. HUGHES. A new volume in the Great Com- 
manders Series, edited by Gen. JAMES GRANT WILSON. 
With Portrait and Maps. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 
The active and varied career of General Joseph E. John- 
ston, the conspicuous part which he took in the civil war, the 
differences of opinion between Jefferson Davis and himself, 
and their effect upon the fortunes of the Confederacy, render 
the story of his life one of engrossing interest and great his- 
torical importance. The author has had access to unpublished 
documents and other sources of fresh information which im- 
part to his work a distinctive quality and a special and per- 
manent value. 

The Gilded Man. 
I El Dorado), 

And other Pictures of the Spanish Occupancy of America. 

By A. F. BANDELIER. 12mo, cloth, f 1.50. 
The author here describes the adventures and romantic epi- 
sodes attendant upon the early Spanish explorations of our 
Southwest. The scene of the story which gives its title to the 
volume is laid in Venezuela, and the legend of El Dorado is 
for the first time told accurately in popular form. With this 
exception the tales relate to our own country. They include 
the stories of the mysterious "Seven Cities of Cibola," " El 
Quivira," and others of equal dramatic interest and historical 
value. 

Factors in American Civilization. 

STUDIES IN APPLIED SOCIOLOGY. A Series of Fourteen Pop- 
ular Lectures and Discussions before the Brooklyn Ethical 
Association. With Index. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 
This is uniform with the two previous volumes of the series, 
entitled respectively "Evolution in Science and Art" and 
"Man and the State." The lectures are by well-known 
writers and speakers, the range of topics embracing all the 
more important sociological questions of the time. 



Speeches and Addresses of William 
McKinley, 

From his Election to Congress to the Present Time. Com- 
piled by JOSEPH P. SMITH, Librarian of the Ohio State 
Library. With Portraits on Steel of the Author and Others. 
8vo, 650 pages, cloth, $2.00. 

These selections, sixty-five in number, embrace a wide range 
of topics of absorbing public interest, and include twenty-five 
speeches devoted to the tariff question in all its aspects ; and 
others on silver, Federal elections, pensions and the public 
debt, civil-service reform, the Treasury surplus and the pur- 
chase of bonds, the direct tax bill, etc. 

The orator whose views are thus presented is the best au- 
thority of his party on most of the matters considered. An 
elaborate analytical Index gives the volume an encyclopedic 
character, which will be especially appreciated at the present 
time by the student of whatever political faith.

The Life of Sir Richard F. Burton. 

By his Wife, ISABEL BURTON. With numerous Portraits, 

Illustrations, and Maps, and 2 colored Plates. In 2 vols., 

8vo, cloth, $12.00. 

"Few men of our time have led a more romantic and adventurous 
life than the late Sir Richard F. Burton. A consummate linguist and 
intrepid traveller, without a rival in his varied knowledge of men, races, 
and religions, the hero of innumerable adventures, and of more than 
one almost impossible undertaking, Burton stands forth in these hum- 
drum days as a rare and almost unique personality. No one is so well 
qualified to do justice to his strange and eventful career as his devoted 
wife, the sharer and interpreter of his inmost thoughts, his associate in 
not a few of his singular experiences. . . . The book presents a strik- 
ing and faithful portrait of a very remarkable man and a stirring record 
of a very romantic career." London Times. 

" The volumes abound in interest of every sort, and they constitute 
an almost perfect course of modern geography and travel for those 
children of a larger growth who will insist on having their knowledge 
of this kind in an entertaining form." London Daily News. 



Camp-Fires of a Naturalist. 

From the Field Notes of LEWIS LINDSAY DYCHE, A.M., 
M.S., Professor of Zoology and Curator of Birds and Mam- 
mals in the Kansas State University. The Story of Four- 
teen Expeditions after North American Mammals. By 
CLARENCE E. EDWORDS. With numerous Illustrations. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" It is not always that a professor of zoology is so enthusiastic a sports- 
man as Prof. Dyche. His hunting exploits are as varied as those of 
Gordon dimming, for example, in South Africa. His grizzly bear is as 
dangerous as the lion, and his mountain sheep and goats more difficult 
to stalk and shoot than any creatures of the torrid zone. Evidently he 
came by his tastes as a hunter from lifelong experience." New York 
Tribune. 

"This book has no dull pages, and is often excitingly interesting, and 
fully instructive as to the habits, haunts, and nature of wild beasts." 
Chicago Inter-Ocean. 

On the Old Frontier. 

By WILLIAM 0. STODDARD, author of " Crowded Out o' Cro- 

field," "Little Smoke," "The Battle of New York," etc. 

Illustrated by H. D. MURPHY. Good Books for Young 

Readers Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In this thrilling story Mr. Stoddard is at his best. He de- 
scribes the vicissitudes of the settlers in western New York, 
which was the frontier of the last century, the homely yet 
adventurous existence at Plum Hollow Fort, the plottings of 
the Iroquois, their assemblage in the great Council House, 
and their final desperate raid. A boy is the hero of the book, 
and every American boy and girl should read it for its his- 
torical value as well as for its romantic interest. 



Louisa Muhlbach's Historical Novels. 

New edition, 18 vols. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, per vol., $1.00. 
In offering to the public our new and illustrated 12mo edi- 
tion of Louisa Muhlbach's celebrated historical romances we 
wish to call attention to the continued and increasing popu- 
larity of these books for over thirty years. These romances 
are as well known in England and America as in the author's 
native country, Germany, and it has been the unanimous ver- 
dict that no other romances reproduce so vividly the spirit and 
social life of the times which are described. In the vividness 
of style, abundance of dramatic incidents, and the distinct- 
ness of the characters portrayed, these books offer exceptional 
entertainment, while at the same time they familiarize the 
reader with the events and personages of great historical 
epochs.

THE LITERARY WEST. 



Mr. Lowell's famous essay " On a Certain 
Condescension in Foreigners " is in need of a 
supplement. "A Certain Condescension in 
Easterners " is a theme that calls for treatment 
in similar vein ; but the pen rusts that alone 
could have dealt with it adequately, that alone 
could have bestowed upon it the measure and 
quality of genial satire that it deserves. For 
many years past the attitude of Eastern writers 
towards literary activity in the West has been 
similar to that once assumed by Boston towards 
New York, and by England towards the United 
States. It has been an attitude of condescen- 
sion, of patronizing counsel, of mild surprise 
that a region so far removed from the centre of 
the intellectual system should venture to have 
such things as literary aspirations. 

" But you are so very far away," was the 
naive remark recently made to a gathering of 
American scholars by a foreign guest who was 
trying to be complimentary, but who could not 
refrain from coupling surprise with admira- 
tion. Most Eastern explorers who brave the 
passes of the Alleghany Mountains, and find 
their way to the intellectual frontier settle- 
ments of the Mississippi Valley, return to their 
homes with a tale from which the element of 
wonder is rarely missing. Every now and then 
some weekly paper or monthly magazine of the 
Atlantic Coast devotes an article to Western 
literature, and, whatever the aspect it selects 
for treatment or the writers it singles out for 
fame, the accent of encouragement is always 
marked. 

This display of provincialism is amusing 
enough to all but the few who live in the in- 
tellectual corners whence it originates ; but it 
has one feature which has not been given the 
prominence that it deserves. As far as con- 
descension goes, with its patronizing implica- 
tions, the classical essay already mentioned may 
possibly be thought to cover the ground, for, 
mutatis mutandis, its criticism is applicable to 
New England narrowness as well as to Old 
England insularity. But the phase of the mat- 
ter which seems to call for particular com- 
ment, and upon which Lowell hardly touched, 
is that illustrated by the kind of literary pro- 
duction which, in both cases, attracts the atten- 



174 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



tion of the elder community to the work of the 
younger. Americans are not a little diverted 
when they notice the sort of thing upon which 
European critics of our literature are wont to 
seize as typical of our intellectual activity. 
"Your countrymen," says Richard Grant White, 
in the character of Mansfield Humphreys, speak- 
ing to his English fellow-traveller, " even the 
intelligent and kindly-intentioned, are so stung 
with a craze after something peculiarly Amer- 
ican from America that they refuse to accept 
anything as American that is not extravagant 
and grotesque. Even in literature they accept 
as American only that which is as strange and 
really as foreign to the tastes and habits of the 
most thoroughbred Americans as it is to them." 
To this propensity of the European we must 
in large measure attribute the astonishing trans- 
atlantic vogue of Poe and Whitman and Mr. 
Harte. Excellent writers all three, and cer- 
tainly among the foremost that this country 
has produced ; yet it is to their accidental char- 
acteristics, rather than to their display of the 
qualities common to all good literature, that 
they in great part owe their reputation abroad. 
To quote once more from the writer above 
mentioned, the foreign critic is constantly put- 
ting to our literature such a question as this : 
" Where is that effluence of the new-born in- 
dividual soul that should emanate from a fresh 
and independent democracy, the possessors of 
a continent, with a Niagara and a Mississippi 
between two vast oceans ? " And the foreign 
critic, finding this " effluence of the new-born 
individual soul " to emanate very perceptibly 
from such a writer as Whitman, seizes upon 
him as a typically American product. To the 
sane student, of course, these characteristics of 
Whitman that so impress the foreigner are 
the husks of his genius ; they are in themselves 
intolerable, but we put up with them because 
of the fitful flashes of imaginative style that 
find their way through these uncouth wrap- 
pings. But the foreigner takes the envelope 
for the substance; while for the American lit- 
erature that is merely good, according to the 
accepted and immutable standards of literary 
workmanship, he has but scant recognition. 

This peculiar attitude of the foreign critic 
towards American writers is closely paralleled 
by the attitude of the East towards the West ; 
and this brings us to the special subject of our 
remarks. When an Eastern writer undertakes 
to discuss the literary activity of the W r est, he 
almost invariably falls into the error of the 
foreign critic, and singles out as noteworthy 



and typical the writers whose work evinces some 
sort of eccentricity. It may be badly written, 
it may be grotesque, it may be vulgar it fre- 
quently has all three of these characteristics, 
but it is original, it is piquant, it satisfies the 
unholy yearning for the new thing. Some com- 
poser of dialect doggerel, cheaply pathetic or 
sentimental, gains the ear of the public ; his 
work has nothing more than novelty to rec- 
ommend it, but the advent of a new poet is her- 
alded, and we are told by Eastern critics that 
the literary West has at last found a voice. 
Some strong-lunged but untrained product of 
the prairies recounts the monotonous routine 
of life on the farm or in the country town, and 
is straightway hailed as the apostle of the new- 
est and consequently the best realism. Some 
professional buffoon strikes a new note of bad 
taste in the columns of the local newspaper, and 
the admiring East holds him up as the exem- 
plar of the coming humor. Some public lec- 
turer, sure of the adulation of his little coterie 
of followers, estimates or interprets the litera- 
ture of the world in accordance with whatever 
vagaries occupy his unregulated fancy, and the 
surprising announcement is made that a great 
creative critic has arisen in our midst. Skilled 
in the arts of self-advertisement, these men are 
quick to enlarge the foothold thus gained ; their 
reputations grow like snowballs ; they come to 
take themselves as seriously as they are taken 
by others ; and the people of real culture and 
refinement, whose numbers are so rapidly in- 
creasing in the West, have to endure the hu- 
miliation of being represented, in the minds of 
a large proportion of their fellow-countrymen, 
by men who are neither cultured nor refined. 
In the meanwhile, hundreds of men and women 
throughout the West are engaged in producing 
literary work too excellent to be obtrusive, 
work that conforms to the recognized standards 
of all serious writing, work that scorns to be 
effective at the cost of style and moderation and 
good taste. But if the average Eastern reader 
be asked who, in his mind, are the represent- 
ative writers of the West, he will name persons 
indignantly repudiated, for the most part, by 
Western readers of intelligence and discrim- 
ination. The selection will doubtless be made 
in good faith, and the fault will not be his ; it 
will be the fault of the newspapers that have 
supplied him with the information, of the care- 
less critics who make it a matter of faith that 
whatever is Western must needs be wild. A 
heavy responsibility rest with these critics both 
for the part they play in giving notoriety to

scribblers who offend against art, and for their 
persistent failure to recognize the really praise- 
worthy work done by Western writers. 

We do not claim that this work is as yet 
very great in amount, or that much of it de- 
serves very high praise ; but we do claim that 
it is respectable both in quality and quantity, 
and that both of these facts are to a consider- 
able extent ignored by Eastern writers. We 
expect that the West will make a large con- 
tribution to American literature during the 
coming ten or twenty years ; and, if ever sane 
criticism is needed, it is at such a time. But 
the criticism we get tends to discourage honest 
workmanship and to encourage what is extrav- 
agant and meretricious. Above all, it is time 
to have done with the notion, forced upon us 
with wearisome iteration by certain writers, 
both Eastern and Western, that the West is 
now developing, or ever will develope, a distinct- 
ive literature of its own. The West and the 
East are peopled by the same sort of men and 
women, and their work, when it deserves the 
name of literature at all, has, and will have, the 
characteristics common to all good writing in 
the English language. The distinction between 
East and West will never be other than an ar- 
tificial one ; even now, many of the best writ- 
ers of either section came to it from the other. 
If the national centre of literary activity fol- 
lows the Westward path of the centre of pop- 
ulation, as seems probable, it will carry with it 
the accepted literary tradition, before which all 
crude local growths of tradition will be forced 
to give way. The coming literature of the 
West may be largely Western in its themes, 
but it will never be Western in its manner, as 
certain blatant rhetoricians would persuade us. 
Except in their relation to choice of subject- 
matter, the terms Eastern and Western, North- 
ern and Southern, have absolutely no literary 
meaning in a country all of whose parts have a 
common speech. The same standards apply to 
all the literature written in the English lan- 
guage, whether produced in England or Austra- 
lia, in Canada or the United States. Still more 
closely do they apply to the literature produced 
in different sections of our country, and it is 
an unfortunate application of local patriotism, 
whether Eastern or Western, that seeks to cre- 
ate a distinction where none should exist, or 
that, in its endeavor to create such a distinc- 
tion, ignores the necessary unity of a national 
literature, and attaches undue weight to the ac- 
cidental qualities of its particular manifesta- 
tions. 



ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL 
STUDIES AT CHICAGO. 



The passing year has been for Chicago one of ex- 
tremes. Never before has there been in the hands 
of her bankers so much money, and never before 
has there been so much of suffering among her 
thousands of unemployed. Never have her mate- 
rial resources been so exploited in the eyes of the 
world, and never has her intellectual and moral life 
been so stirred and stimulated, as in the past few 
months. For nearly half a year she has been play- 
ing the host to a series of Congresses devoted to 
wellnigh every field of thought which contributes 
its ideals to the culture of the race ; and she has 
found leisure at the same time to entertain a vast 
array of conventions, conferences, and annual meet- 
ings of literary, scientific, and industrial associa- 
tions. During a large part of September the atten- 
tion of the public was rightly concentered on the 
sessions of the Congress of Religions, perhaps the 
most remarkable gatherings of the whole series. 
But while the local press gave its pages copiously 
to the chronicle of this Congress, it almost ignored 
the presence, at the same time, of two bodies whose 
sessions in Chicago mark an important stage in our 
intellectual growth. 

The International Statistical Association held dur- 
ing the second week of September its fifth biennial 
session, in the halls of the University of Chicago, 
in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Amer- 
ican Economic Association. The session of the for- 
mer was fraught with the greatest interest, many 
very notable papers being read. The proceedings of 
the Economic Association were concentrated into 
one rich day, when papers were read by Gen. Fran- 
cis A. Walker, and Professors Hadley, Patten, 
Clark, and Taussig. The speakers were all mas- 
ters in their fields, and the small audiences were 
composed of experts and workers. With no par- 
ticular notice from the outside world, these meet- 
ings were conducted with an earnestness of purpose 
and of attention which made their sessions a valua- 
ble contribution to the advancement of social science, 
stimulating and invigorating that kind of research 
which is conducted quietly in a corner, and which 
is known generally in its results rather than in its 
agents, to whom the obtainment of truth is a suffi- 
cient quid pro quo. 

The combined meetings brought Chicago a spe- 
cial double honor for the first time. During the 
seven years of its existence, the Economic Associa- 
tion has seemed to find in the western boundary of 
the thirteen original States a Rubicon beyond whose 
charmed frontier it could not pass. At last the As- 
sociation has gone forth to possess the continent ; 
and Chicago is seized as the key to the situation. 
The International Association takes its first flight 
over sea, and is introduced to America by Chicago. 
Both departures are significant. At the banquet 
which the International Association enjoyed at the

hands of its entertainers the Statistical and Econ- 
omic Associations of America among the honored 
guests at the head of the table sat Chicago's three 
college presidents, educators, all of them, by a 
life-work of training, and all of them recognized as 
investigators and original scholars. In their affilia- 
tion with the leading economists of America and 
the most prominent statisticians of many lands was 
made manifest Chicago's place in the forefront 
of the newer education, where scientific research 
and liberal training go hand in hand. By its visit 
to America, the International Association recog- 
nizes the statistical work of a land where Col. Car- 
roll D. Wright stands the acknowledged peer of 
any statistician living, and where a school of younger 
statisticians is growing up around governmental and 
collegiate centres as brilliant as it is exact. By its 
visit to Chicago, the Economic Association focuses 
its attention on the home of the youngest of our 
economic publications " The Journal of Political 
Economy," which at a single stride has taken a 
place beside the Harvard " Quarterly Journal of 
Economics " and " The Economic Journal " of the 
British Association. Nowhere on this continent can 
economic problems be studied to better advantage 
than in the city which probably already ranks first 
in population, and where varied nationality as well 
as numbers present some of the most perplexing 
aspects of social turmoil. Nowhere better can the 
statistical expert find the raw material of his com- 
binations than in this largest centre of the food sup- 
plies of the world. In every variety of produc- 
tion, in every phase of distribution, in every agency 
of exchange, this city is a huge laboratory of econ- 
omic phenomena, furnishing experiments ready made 
to the hand of the observer. Here, whence twenty- 
five lines of railway radiate, and where two hun- 
dred and fifty miles of street tramways intermesh, 
the railroad problem is best surveyed. No other 
city furnishes larger scope for the student of muni- 
cipal economics. Nowhere is the evil that a Toyn- 
bee Hall or a Hull House seeks to face more ap- 
parent. The World's Columbian Exposition, un- 
doubtedly, brought us the Statistical and Economic 
Associations in its train; but the Exposition has 
helped to reveal to a large portion of humanity 
what the London " Times " called a greater exhibit 
than the White City " Chicago itself. And this 
thronging of the millions at our doors has put them 
in the way to see that not only has Chicago the stu- 
pendous material resources which have made the 
Exposition an educational success, but that she is 
also awakening to a higher life, of which her uni- 
versities, her libraries, her Art Institute, her learned 
societies, are but the earnest. It has forced them 
to recognize the magnitude of our industrial life, and 
it will undoubtedly lead the thinkers and workers 
among them to turn their gaze more frequently 
upon our great laboratory of social science, where 
not a few of the leading investigators of the coun- 
try are already at work. J OHK j. HALSEY.

LITERARY TRIBUTES TO 
WORLD'S FAIR. 



THE 



No person of prominence in the literary world 
has, we believe, been rash enough to attempt a de- 
scription of the Columbian Exposition. The special 
correspondents have, of course, portrayed it in a 
variety of aspects and in gorgeous newspaper style ; 
and occasionally a venturesome poet has taken a 
shy at it in a sonnet or a quatrain. But to de- 
scribe it as a whole, to realize the full vision of the 
White City in words and fix them in literature, is 
a task too formidable for any near beholder, whose 
brain is overwhelmed and bewildered by its own 
impressions. As Professor Lounsbury, of Yale, 
aptly expresses it : "I could no more describe the 
impression made upon me by the Exposition than 
I could pick up one of the buildings and carry it 
off on my shoulders. It was simply a journey into 
Fairyland ; and I know of no one that ever lived 
who made a trip of that kind and brought back any 
adequate account of what he had seen with the 
exception of Shakespeare." Yet there is always a 
special value in the word of an eye-witness, and 
first impressions are significant, however imperfect 
their expression. THE DIAL has lately interested 
itself in collecting from a number of the prominent 
literary people who have visited the Fair some brief 
comments on or characterizations of it, such as 
might serve to show, in some measure, the impres- 
sion which the Fair as a spectacle makes on the lit- 
erary mind. In these fragmentary but often felic- 
itous expressions, which are given below, there will 
be found much that is of interest. The reserve 
shown by these practised writers befits the vastness 
of the theme ; they prudently refrain from attempt- 
ing to exhaust either the subject or themselves. 
Possibly some less experienced and more enthus- 
iastic writers may find a hint here worth the noting. 
The best writers do not " gush," or depend over- 
much on adjectives, even when writing of a Colum- 
bian Exposition. 

MARY HARTWELL CATHERWOOD. 

Mrs. Catherwood's contribution so admirably re- 
flects what is doubtless the dominant impression 
made by the Exposition upon imaginative minds 
the impression of magical and bewildering beauty, 
tinged with sadness at its transitoriness that we 
gladly place it at the head of the collection. 

" The more I see of the Fair the more I want to see 
of it. I long to wake up there and get its aspects in 
the early morning; and to haunt it when the lights are 
turned off after midnight. It is not like any other 
country I have ever seen. As soon as you become a 
day-inhabitant of the White World, you are emancipated 
from the troubles of earth. It has a strange effect. I 
am all the time conscious of deep pity for any human 
being who loses the sight of it. One of its strangest 
influences is stripping you of the sense of locality. I can 
find my way anywhere on the crust of the globe ; but in 
the Fair I give it up. Geography may go by the board. 
I take with thankfulness the place which comes nearest 
to me, and my head whirls, and the Plaisance moves

from side to side in its usual game of hide and seek. 

" So fascinating is the environment there that I never 
expect to learn anything from the exhibits: there is no 
time. Some day I shall mourn lost opportunities. But 
mortals cannot do everything. And one can expand his 
knowledge and take a world-bath in Jackson Park now 
by merely sitting still and watching the nations pass by. 

"One question I dare not face: What shall we do 
when this Wonderland is closed ? when it disappears 
- when the enchantment comes to an end." 

CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. 

Mr. Warner's word is for use rather than beauty 
rather, perhaps, for the usefulness of beauty. 

" I think that those who were most familiar with the 
finest architectural effects abroad were most astonished 
at the aesthetic side of our World's Fair. It was wholly 
unexpected. But the impression upon the great public 
of the United States of this incomparable vision of 
beauty is more important. The sight of it has changed 
the world, has changed the aspect and the estimate of 
life, for tens of thousands of home-keeping people. It 
has introduced into practical lives the element of beauty, 
and opened a new world of enjoyment. The extent of 
this transformation grows upon me, since I visited the 
Fair, in conversation with others, and in letters I have 
seen from all parts of the Union, which speak of what 
the spectacle at Jackson Park has done for the writers. 
I do not mean in regard to the competing exhibits 
those have their separate educating influence, but to 
the quickening of the imagination, and the enlargement 
of the appreciation of beauty. It is no criticism upon 
the people of the United States, absorbed in material 
development, to say that they needed just such an up- 
lift. If it cannot be called a spiritual influence, it is an 
aesthetic impulse that leads away from materialism." 

GEORGE W. CABLE. 

Mr. Cable, too, finds in the Fair a great and per- 
manent educating influence, well worth its cost. 

" I consider that notwithstanding any supposable 
money loss to those who have invested their funds in 
the Fair, it is nevertheless one of the best investments 
the city of Chicago has ever made. It has lifted her status 
in the national estimation and declared her the first of 
American cities. The higher values of the Exposition 
it would be pleasant to predict, but they must be left 
for time to prove. I believe time will show them to be 
vast. The educative and stimulative effect to hun- 
dreds and thousands of the people of our nation will be 
incalculable. As a single instance, I think we may look 
with confidence for a great salutary effect upon the pub- 
lic architecture of our country." 

HENRY B. FULLER. 

Mr. Fuller's thought is also of the great good the 
Fair will do Chicago. 

" Chicago, having been in the world for some fifty or 
sixty years, is now finally of it. Instead of merely be- 
ing connected by rail, water, and wire with the various 
great centres of the world, it is on the point of becom- 
ing a great centre itself not merely commercial, but 
financial, social, political, artistic, educational. The 
West is leaving the provincial standpoint which, not 
long ago, was that taken by the country generally : the 
idea that we are big enough and strong enough and suc- 
cessful enough to live our own detached life according 
to our own isolated standard. Some few remnants of 
this narrow notion still linger : the bumptious Western 



objection to making over our ministers at foreign courts 
into ambassadors, and the monstrous far-western belief 
that we may maintain a monetary standard of our own 
that contravenes the general understanding of Christen- 
dom. The Fair, in fine, has brought the world to us, 
and sent us out into the world, and given us a chance 
to " heft " it, and to find our place in it, and to estab- 
lish intelligent and intelligible relations with it. The 
30th of October, 1893, will be Chicago's graduation 
day. And the World's Columbian Exposition will be 
found to be no mere ' business college,' qualifying us 
narrowly for a narrow life and its narrow purposes, but 
a real and broad university one to advance us in the 
arts, the sciences, the amenities, the humanities." 

HJALMAR H. BOYESEN. 

Prof. Boyesen sees in the external features of the 
Fair the realization of some glorious dream. 

" The Fair is the completest and most magnificent 
resume of the world's work and thought that ever has 
been gathered in one place. In its external aspect it is 
a vision of delight unrivalled on this side of Fairyland. 
To describe the beauty of the electric illumination at 
night is beyond the capacity of any language. It is as 
if some bold spirit had dreamed a glorious dream which 
by enchantment had petrified into reality." 

HARRIET MONROE. 

Miss Monroe, whose " Columbian Ode " was the 
literary feature of the opening of the Exposition, 
has given a later impression, happily condensed 
into a sonnet. 

" I saw a water-lily rise one morn, 
White, wondrous, and above the level blue 
Unveil her virgin petals to the dew 
And fill her heart with sunlight. She was born 
Of royal race, to reign and to adorn. 
O'er the wide world the joyous tidings flew, 
And all the nations came with treasures new 
To praise her loveliness, and weep forlorn. 
For from the host went forth a mighty sigh 
That ere the falling of a summer sun 
The dream must pass, the splendor fade away. 
Yet knew I well her beauty could not die. 
When she hath gone her power is but begun : 
Death sends the soul to God's eternal day." 

WILLIAM P. TRENT. 

Another felicitous sonnet comes from Prof. W. 
P. Trent, of Sewanee College. " It was written," 
says the author, " one sleepless night at my hotel in 
Chicago, after a day at the Exposition. It is at 
least an unfeigned and spontaneous tribute to what 
I believe to be the most beautiful thing in all the 
world a thing that we call ' The White City,' but 
for which no name is fitting or sufficient." 

" Where once the red deer, chased by wily foes, 
Sought the broad bosom of the peaceful lake, 
Behold a noble city bloom and break 
Into a flower of beauty ! It arose 
As though from some enchanter's wand, and glows 
With supernatural splendor. Angels take 
Shy glimpses from the sunset clouds that make 
The only rivals that it fears or knows. 

O fair dream-city of the fruitful West 

Fair as the splendid visions that appeared 

To Prospero's companions, and conf est 

To be as frail, thou yet shalt live ensphered 

In every grateful memory that hath blest 

The minds that planned thee and the hands that reared."

[Oct. 1, 



PAUL BOURGET. 

M. Paul Bourget, the French novelist, gives a few 
unstudied observations. 

" The Fair is like Chicago. ... I have only the 
general first conception of a vast wilderness of beauty. 
Vast, big more than any description could carry. It 
is wholly unlike the Paris Exposition. The two could 
hardly be compared. There are no common points of 
similarity; they are not of the same kind. This is the 
more wonderful by far greater in expectation and re- 
alization, but American, typically so. That such a great 
city of white beauty should have been reared from level 
areas of wooded waste is a miracle. . . . The effect 
of the water the artificial waterways, I mean is sur- 
passingly beautiful. But I am attempting to speak of 
what has struck me dumb with wonderment." 

WALTER BESANT. 

From Mr. Besant's " First Impressions of the 
Fair," as printed in " The Cosmopolitan " maga- 
zine, we make the following characteristic extracts : 

" When the visitor happens to be a literary man, one 
who is in the habit of writing and speaking of things 
offered to the public, he wanders about the courts and 
galleries of the Exposition oppressed, far more than the 
inarticulate person, by the vastness of the subject. To 
such a man the great truth that he cannot say anything 
adequate and that he need not try, falls upon his spirit, 
when it is once grasped, like a cool shower on a hot af- 
ternoon. It lends a new and quite peculiar charm to 
the show. . . . 

" The bigness of the World's Fair first strikes and 
bewilders one tries in vain to understand it and then 
it saddens. I observe that most people, like Xerxes, 
set down their tears to the evanescent nature of the 
show. . . . Then again, the Poetry of the thing! Did 
the conception spring from one brain, like the Iliad ? 
Were these buildings every one, to the unprofessional 
eye, a miracle of beauty, thus arranged so as to pro- 
duce this marvellous effect of beauty by one master 
brain, or by many ? For never before, in any age, in 
any country, has there been so wonderful an arrange- 
ment of lovely buildings as at Chicago in the present 
year of grace. . . . Those English travellers who have 
written of Chicago dwell upon its vast wealth, its cease- 
less activity, its enormous blocks of houses and offices, 
upon everything that is in Chicago except that side of 
it which is revealed in the World's Fair. Yes, it is a 
very busy place; its wealth is boundless; but it has been 
able to conceive somehow, and has carried into execu- 
tion somehow, the greatest and most poetical dream 
that we have ever seen. Call it no more the White 
City on the Lake; it is Dreamland. Apollo and the 
Muses, with the tinkling of their lyres, drown the bells 
of the train and the trolley ; the people dream epics ; 
Art and Music and Poetry belong to Chicago; the hub 
of the universe is transferred from Boston to Chicago; 
this place must surely become, in the immediate future, 
the centre of a nobler world the world of Art and 
Letters." 

RICHARD WATSON GILDER. 

To the foregoing brief but expressive tributes we 
are very glad to add Mr. R. W. Gilder's beautiful 
poem written for the October " Century " and printed 
here from an advance copy kindly furnished by him. 
It is an eloquent expression of the feelings awakened 



in contemplation of the early disappearance of the 
Exposition, and -is called "The Vanishing City." 

"Enraptured memory, and all ye powers of being, 

To new life waken ! Stamp the vision clear 
On the soul's inmost substance. let seeing 

Be more than seeing ; let the entranced ear 
Take deep these surging sounds, inweaved with light 

Of unimagined radiance ; let the intense 
Illumined loveliness that thrills the night 

Strike in the human heart some deeper sense ! 
So shall these domes that meet heaven's curved blue, 

And yon long, white imperial colonnade, 
And many-columned peristyle endue 

The mind with beauty that shall never fade : 
Though all too soon to dark oblivion wending, 
Reared in one happy hour to know as swift an ending. 

" Thou si i alt of all the cities of the world 

Famed for their grandeur, ever more endure 
Imperishably and all alone impearled 

In the world's living thought, the one most sure 
Of love undying and of endless praise 

For beauty only, chief of all thy kind ; 
Immortal, even because of thy brief days ; 

Thou cloud-built, fairy city of the mind ! 
Here man doth pluck from the full tree of life 

The latest, lordliest flower of earthly art ; 
This doth he breathe, while resting from his strife, 

This presses he against his weary heart, 
Then, wakening from his dream within a dream, 
He flings the faded flower on Time's down-rushing stream. 

" never as here in the eternal years 

Hath burst to bloom man's free and soaring spirit, 
Joyous, untrammelled, all untouched by tears 

And the dark weight of woe it doth inherit. 
Never so swift the mind's imaginings 

Caught sculptured form, and color. Never before 
Save where the soul beats unembodied wings 

'Gainst viewless skies was such enchanted shore 
Jewelled with ivory palaces like these : 

By day a miracle, a dream by night ; 
Yet real as beauty is, and as the seas 

Whose waves glance back keen lines of glittering light 
When million lamps, and coronets of fire, 
And fountains as of flame to the bright stars aspire. 

" Glide, magic boat, from out the green lagoon, 

'Neath the dark bridge, into this smiting glow 
And unthought glory. Even the glistening moon 

Hangs in the nearer splendor. Let not go 
The scene, my soul, till ever 't is thine own ! 

This is Art's citadel and crown. How still 
The innumerous multitudes from every zone, 

That watch and listen ; while each eye doth fill 
With joyous tears unwept. Now solemn strains 

Of brazen music give the waiting soul 
Voice and a sigh, it other speech disdains, 

Here where the visual sense faints to its goal ! 
Ah, silent multitudes, ye are a part 
Of the wise architect's supreme and glorious art ! 

" joy almost too high for saddened mortal ! 

ecstasy envisioned ! Thou shouldst be 
Lasting as thou art, lovely ; as immortal 

As through all time the matchless thought of thee ! 
Yet would we miss then the sweet piercing pain 

Of thy inconstancy ! Could we but banish 
This haunting pang, ah, then thou wouldst not reign 

One with the golden sunset that doth vanish 
Through myriad lingering tints down melting skies ; 

Nor the pale mystery of the new-world flower 
That blooms once only, then forever dies 

Pouring a century's wealth on one dear hour. 
Then vanish, City of Dream, and be no more ; 
Soon shall this fair Earth's self be lost on the unknown shore.

BAILF PAPERS AND THEIR READERS: 

A SUGGESTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

I wish to express my great appreciation and earnest 
approval of the noble and notable editorials on journal- 
ism that have lately appeared in THE DIAL. The un- 
satisfactory character of the average metropolitan news- 
paper (there are exceptions that deserve praise and up- 
ward tendencies in certain quarters that merit commend- 
ation) I think is more widely felt and more keenly re- 
gretted than is often supposed. It has become very 
largely a mere mechanical contrivance for the gather- 
ing of comparatively unimportant items, which are de- 
scribed with tiresome verbosity: trivial personalities 
spun into sensational columns, the barbarities of crim- 
inals magnified and thrown upon a canvas which would 
do for the records of the day of judgment, numberless 
incidents of the sporting world made into a vast pile of 
news out of all proportion to their general interest or 
real importance, the idle gossip and inane doings of 
brainless men and heartless women forced daily upon 
our attention as a part of the world's history worthy 
our remembrance. Skip what is trivial, morbid, and 
unwholesome, and how little is left; look for an ade- 
quate report of the heroism and progress of mankind, 
and how seldom it is found. The " blanket sheet " is 
often called the mirror of the world; but how false the 
statement ! Trivial things are there made to look like 
affairs of immense magnitude, while what is there re- 
flected very largely belongs to the seamy and unseemly 
side of human life that may well be kept in silence and 
darkness. 

What I wish, however, is not so much to bring an 
accusation as to bear my testimony and make a sugges- 
tion. I do not believe that even business considerations 
warrant the policy which so largely controls the man- 
agement of the press in this respect. The people want 
the news and all the news, we are told. And this fact 
is used to justify the filling of column after column 
with the longest possible accounts of the worst and 
least important happenings of the day. Probably this 
policy pleases some, and increases sales to a certain ex- 
tent. But I believe that a large majority of people 
want a different and a better paper a paper that would 
crowd these matters into small space or drop them alto- 
gether and give more news of a wholesome and instruct- 
ive character. I believe that this class, at present 
silent in dissent and protest, is larger than the business 
manager calculates, and that to conduct a newspaper 
with more consideration of its wishes would be a sound 
financial policy. 

But what shall we do about it ? Have an endowed 
press that shall be a philanthropic enterprise, maintain- 
ing a high 'standard in spite of the business tide against 
it ? Perhaps; but I dislike to see such a confession of 
the weakness of righteousness. Besides, I do not think 
this the permanent or the necessary solution of the 
problem. Public sentiment is powerful, and newspa- 
pers are run to make money. Remembering these two 
facts, those of us who want a nobler journalism must try 
in every way to make our demands felt and obeyed. If 
the people at present dissatisfied with the press as it is 
(they are a great multitude) will but make their wants 
clearly understood and forcibly felt, the press will re- 
spond. Let every man who desires something better 



put the pressure of his opinion upon editor and mana- 
ger, and improvement will begin at once. The people 
can usually have what they want if they ask for it. It 
will not do to disapprove but keep silent, and by buy- 
ing the paper make the management think that we are 
satisfied. Let every man who reads these words sit 
down and write out his protest and send it into the edi- 
torial room. Let him get ten neighbors to do the same, 
each under promise that he will secure ten others who 
will roll on the multiple of ten. Before many days, 
editor and manager would be putting their heads to- 
gether in grave consultation, and soon reporters would 
be sent out to hunt for news in new and higher realms. 
It would be seen that business policy demands a more 
wholesome journalism. We can have something better, 
but we must make the demand felt in order to get it. 

I am confident of two things: (1) A vast number of 
people want a different and a nobler newspaper. They 
now buy in silence what they do not like, while they run 
their eyes with disgust over pages which they would, be 
glad not to see. (2) If these people will make their 
demand in a systematic and forcible manner, it will 
make an impression and work a revolution. This will 
put the force of gravity on our side, and business en- 
terprise will find its way very quickly in our direction. 
There is nothing like divine discontent: a gruff voice, 
but of powerful eloquence ! If need be, we must or- 
ganize and agitate in order to make business managers 
of the press feel that there is profit in paying attention 
to the wishes of those who demand a clean, instructive, 
and wholesome newspaper, in which the quality and 
proportion of news shall bear some relation to the needs 
and decencies of human life. j_ jj < CROOKER

"NONE BUT THEY," ETC. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

I reply to Mr. R. O. Williams's letter in your issue 
of August 1 : 

Landor, in The Last Fruit Off an Old Tree," dog- 
matizes as follows: 

" ' Antique ' is the worst portion of Gray's heritage. . . . 
Iir honest truth, we neither have, nor had then, a better and 
[read or] purer writer than he r [read him], although he lived 
in the time of the purest and best, Goldsmith, Sterne, Field- 
ing, and Inchbald." 

With reference to this, I venture in my " Modern 
English " to query : " But is Gray's English, from the 
ordinary point of view, altogether faultless ? " And 
then I specify words and phrases from Gray, among 
which are " none but they " and " nobody but I." These 
expressions, in the opinion of Mr. Williams, are " very 
good English, as good English as there is." 

Compendiously, old authors may, I know, be quoted, 
without number, for "none but they " and the like; and, 
in recent times, these archaisms have been indulged in 
by poets, as a license of their craft, or else for the sake 
of quaintness, from a love of which, if not from a re- 
ductive reminiscence of Biblical phraseology, they have 
also now and then found favor with prose writers of 
the same period. Lord Macaulay has, to be sure, the 
verse, "Which none but he can wield"; but has he 
allowed himself a similar construction anywhere in his 
essays, history, or letters ? 

Dr. Latham, in his edition of Johnson's Dictionary, 
adducing, in connection with the point under discussion, 
" we are all ready but he " and " we are all ready but

Mm" says that, " in writing, the nominative is the com- 
moner." In proof of this assertion, he gives, however, 
only one quotation, and that is from Cowper's " John 
Gilpin,"whobuthe?" 

Dr. Murray, in illustration of what he considers to 
be modern usage, proposes, in the " New English Dic- 
tionary " : " Is there anyone in the house but she? (or but 
her ?) Who could have done it but he ? (or but him ?)" 
Where Dr. Murray hesitates, Dr. William Smith and 
Mr. Theophilus D. Hall, in their popular English Gram- 
mar, distinctly disapprove. 

Parenthetically, I am aware of the speculation that, 
in Shakespeare's "who hath any cause to mourn but 
we f " as in like cases, possibly, " but is used as a passive 
participle with nominative absolute." So the Rev. Dr. 
E. A. Abbott, in his Shakespearian grammar (ed. 1871), 
p. 81. 

Mr. C. P. Mason, in his English Grammar (ed. 1881), 
has, in a foot-note to p. 124: 

" ' Ne nis na god buten he '=' there is no God but he [is God].' 
This shows that but may be followed by a nominative case, 
provided the ellipse can be filled up so as to allow of its oc- 
currence in the complete sentence. ' Nobody knows it but he' 
= ' Nobody knows it but he [knows it].' It is equally correct 
to say ' Nobody knows it but him ; only but is then a preposi- 
tion, and but him forms a limiting adjunct to nobody." 

"Nobody knows it but he [knows it]," without punc- 
tuation, as transcribed, is unmeaning. Nor does the 
interposition of a semicolon after " it " mend matters ; 
for how can he know it, if nobody knows it ? Who can 
say that sophistry may not next equate " I saw nobody 
but him " with " I saw nobody but [I saw] him," and 
attempt to do away altogether with but as a prep- 
osition ? To argue as Mr. Mason does is to no prac- 
tical purpose. Neither analogy nor ancient prescrip- 
tion, but only the concensus of good modern writers, 
could legitimate but he for our ordinary service. This, 
also, merely in passing. 

The fact is, that but he, but she, but we, and but they, 
preceded by anyone, everyone, nobody, none, all, etc., are 
not, in our time, conspicuously common. The case stand- 
ing thus," we are all ready but he " and " we are all ready 
but him " being propounded for option, " it is probable," 
according to Dr. Latham, " that few persons could tell, 
without reflection, which of the two he [read they] would 
give." Nevertheless, most persons would, I surmise, 
involuntarily choose, rather than " nobody was there but 
/," "nobody was there but me"; though, much more 
frequently, they would, in a like connection, use except 
me, or besides me, instead of but me. Contrast, too, 
" anybody but she would consent " with " no one was to 
blame but me," in Thackeray's " Esmond," ch. xiv. 

Accordingly, I doubt whether " none but they " and 
" nobody but /," which, in the diction of prose, were, 
already in Gray's age, dropping out of literary cur- 
rency, are, for us, "altogether faultless." Mr. Wil- 
liams has by no means proved that, for everyday em- 
ployment, they are " as good English as there is." Let 
versifiers avail themselves of them, if they please, still 
I am disposed to think that such locutions should be 
avoided by others. Not a few long-established modes 
of speech, as " whom do men say that I am ? " we cer- 
tainly do well in cashiering. That things of this kind, 
though ever so objectionable, possess an obstinate vital- 
ity, is a matter of course. "Between you and 7" de- 
forms the pages of many an author that has, in the main, 
acquitted himself meritoriously. And here, as curiosi- 
ties, are two quotations for grammar quite as infirm: 
"By the mere Law of Nature, no one is bound by the act 



of another except he who is the successor of his property." 
(Rev. Dr. W. Whewell, " Grotius " [1853], vol. iii., p. 41. 1 

" All metaphysicians, except you, and /, and Boole, con- 
sider mathematics as," etc. (Professor A. De Morgan [1857], 
in the Rev. R. P. Graves's "Life of Sir W. R. Hamilton," 
vol. iii., p. 512, [1889.] 

On going afresh through the voluminous notes of 
which I formerly worked up a part, in criticizing the 
language of Cardinal Newman, I discover, in a group 
of them which would have suited my purpose, if it had 
struck my eye opportunely, two, in particular. I refer 
to the passages which Mr. Williams cites, containing, 
respectively, "none but she " and "any men but they." 
Expressions matching these I have observed in Sheri- 
dan, Eliot Warburton, Sir G. W. Dasent, and others. 

High as was, and as still is, my esteem for Cardinal 
Newman's English, I cannot regard his " none but she " 
and " any men but they " as very much better than, for 
instance, his "an human," "an hymn," "is dead of a 
fever," " another from," "anywhere than," "the hitherto 
editions," " has drank," " helpmeet," and " conventical " 
for " conventicular." 

To conclude, I would here once more frankly ac- 
knowledge that " Modern English," which was published 
twenty years ago, is not free from grave defects. It is 
a book of which I am not in the least degree proud ; 
and any genuine exposure of its mistakes I shall always 
welcome, as subserving the interests of truth. Mr. 
Williams now has my second answer to his reiterated 
inquiry, " Has F. H. ever erred ? " F H 

Marlesford, England, Sept. 4, 1893. 

P. S. As concerns "there is one God, and there is 
none other but he," but, when it follows none other, no 
other, no one else, etc., is equivalent to than, and is, to 
this day, sometimes substituted for it. Other and else, 
not their qualificatives, are there constructed with but. 
May it not be that some moderns, failing to perceive 
this, have given in to no one but he, on the hasty sup- 
position of its being on all fours with none other but he ? 

To the same category as the ungrammatical " I saw 
no man but he " belongs the subjoined sentence from 
Cardinal Newman: 

" Certainly, I am one among a thousand, all of them wrong 
but I." (" Discussions," etc., [1872] p. 6.) 

If Shakespeare were not an ancient, a parallel to this 
would be offered in his " what stays had I but they f " 

Even experts occasionally slip with respect to cases 
of pronouns, by prescribing them wrongly. Thus, Pro- 
fessor Adams S. Hill, quoting, from Burke, " it will be, 
by some one abler than me, demonstrated," etc., would 
have " than me" replaced by " than /." (" The Principles 
of Rhetoric" [1878], p. 46. I have seen no other edition 
of this work.) 

THE English law of copyright is thus characterized 
by a correspondent of the London " Atheuseum": " The 
whole law of copyright abounds with the most subtle 
distinctions, and all sorts of arguments are capable of 
being advanced in every case that arises, and not al- 
ways on the merits either, to defeat the opposite party. 
No wonder people avoid going to law on a question of 
copyright. The expense is usually very great, the wear 
and tear past relief, the point in dispute in nine cases 
out of ten practically unimportant, and the result so un- 
certain that if the few litigants there could be per- 
suaded to settle their differences by an appeal to the 
first intelligent person they met in the street, they would 
show a considerable amount of common sense."

AMERICAN HISTORY FROM AX ENGLISH 
STANDPOINT.* 



Into a compact octavo of three hundred pages 
Professor Goldwin Smith has measurably suc- 
ceeded, by dint of a sort of mental tour de 
force, in compressing the pith and rationale of 
the political history of the United States from 
1492 to 1871. His book is by no means a piece 
of literary joiner-work. It is a spirited, log- 
ically coherent narrative, conceived in the phil- 
osophical spirit of the historical essay, and 
studded throughout with graphic pictures of 
leading men and events. Much historical de- 
tail is of course omitted ; but the extreme suc- 
cinctness of the work is, after all, largely due 
to the author's mastery of his theme, and to 
his ability to condense into an epigram what 
he well might have spun out into a page. The 
book is not free from minor errors of fact, 
- such, for instance, as the crediting of the 
Charter Oak episode to Providence, Rhode 
Island, and the average American reader who 
has drawn his ideas from what Mr. Smith terms 
panegyrical histories will certainly dissent from 
some of its conclusions. But in the main the 
work is as sound as it is lucid and animated ; 
and to the student of our history it will prove 
an invaluable aid in securing that grasp of the 
whole attainable only through a rapid survey 
<)f essentials. In the preface the author states 
that his sketch is intended chiefly for English 
readers ; for " an American, being familiar 
with the main facts and general relations of 
parties, would look for details." American 
familiarity with the " main facts " is not likely, 
we think, to check American curiosity as to 
Mr. Smith's version of them ; and the book 
seems to us, presupposing as it often does a 
knowledge of what it omits or merely glances 
at, to be better suited to American readers than 
to those for whom it is especially " intended." 
Of the five chapters into which the contents are 
divided, the first treats of the Colonial period, 
the second of that of the Revolution, the third 
and fourth review the history of the Government 
from Washington's presidency to the outbreak 
of the Civil War, and the fifth is devoted to 
the epoch of " Rupture and Reconstruction." 

Of especial interest and force are the por- 
traits and characterizations of prominent men, 

* THE UNITED STATES : An Outline of Political History, 
1492-1871. By Goldwin Smith, D.C.L. New York : Mac- 
millan & Co. 



from Franklin to Lincoln. It is here perhaps 
that the author excels. Washington, Hamil- 
ton, Jefferson, Clay, Jackson, Webster, Cal- 
houn, and others, are sketched with a bold yet 
discriminating hand, and usually with a whole- 
some qualification of conventional ideals. The 
list is appropriately headed with Benjamin 
Franklin the "destined harbinger of the Rev- 
olution," an " offspring of New England Puri- 
tanism grown mellow ": 

" His commercial shrewdness, his practical invent- 
iveness, his fundamental integrity, his public spirit, his 
passion for improvement, were native to his community 
in the phase which it had now reached, no less than were 
his ' Poor Richard ' philosophy of life and the absence in 
him of anything spiritual or romantic. He it was who 
in his boyhood had suggested to his father that much 
time might be saved by saying grace at once over the 
whole barrel of red herrings." 

In marked contrast to the thrifty New En 
gland sage was Patrick Henry : 

" This man had tried various ways of earning a liveli- 
hood, and had failed in all. He was bankrupt at twenty- 
three, and lounged in thriftless idleness, till he found 
that though he could not live by industry, he could 
live by his eloquent tongue. . . . Henry's first ex- 
ploit as a barrister was a successful defence of the 
spoliation of the clergy, an unpopular order, by an ap- 
peal to public passion against legal right. Civil dis- 
cord brought him at once to the front. ... It is 
no wonder that Patrick Henry could so vividly por- 
tray to his audience the attitude of a slave. From the 
beginning to the end of his life he was a slaveholder, 
he bought slaves, he sold slaves, and by his will, with 
his cattle, he bequeathed slaves. A eulogist says of 
him that he could buy or sell a horse or a negro as well 
as anybody. That he was in some degree conscious of 
the inconsistency does not alter the fact. Other patriot 
orators besides Patrick Henry, when they lavished the 
terms slave and slavery in their revolutionary harangues, 
might have reflected that they had only to look round 
them in order to see what real slaves and slavery were." 

Scarcely better than the Boanergic Virginian 
phrase-maker fares John Adams, "chief fo- 
menter of the revolutionary quarrel in New 
England ": 

" This man had failed in business as a maltster and 
as a tax collector, but he succeeded as a political agita- 
tor, and has found a shrine in American history as a pa- 
triot saint. Though an enthusiast he was not wanting 
in the astuteness of the politician. The latest of his 
American biographers cannot help surmising that his 
puritan conscience must have felt a twinge when in the 
very time at which he had devoted himself body and 
soul to breaking the link that bound America to En- 
gland, he was coining for this or that body phrases full 
of reverence for the king and rejecting the thought of 
independence." 

Mr. Smith does not forget, however, to note 
subsequently that it was owing to the " honesty 
and wisdom of John Adams" that the recogni- 
tion of private debts was obtained from the gen-

eral government after independence was won. 

Ample justice is rendered to the picturesque 
figure and character of Andrew Jackson, 
" the Congressman from Tennessee, of gaunt 
frame and grim aspect, with elf locks hanging 
over his face and his hair tied behind in an 
eel skin, and so hot in temper that when he 
tried to speak his utterance was choked by pas- 
sion ": 

"Jackson, although he had once been in Congress, 
and had vented his jealous spleen on Washington, was 
a fighter, with an iron will and great powers of com- 
mand, ill educated, destitute of the knowledge and the 
habits of a statesman, with an uncontrolled temper, and 
almost as much swayed by passion as any Indian chief, 
though, like many an Indian chief, he could bear him- 
self with dignity and even with grace. That he had 
beaten the British at New Orleans, was his title to the 
headship of the nation . . . But a greater force even 
than that of military renown was bearing on Andrew 
Jackson to the Presidency. Hitherto the Republic had 
not been democratic. The common people had been 
content with their votes and had left government to an 
aristocracy of intellect drawn largely from the bar. 
But they desired to govern. They were beginning to 
suspect that they were fooled by intellect and to wish 
to see one of themselves in power. Andrew Jackson 
was one of themselves; he was not only the old hero 
but ' Old Hickory,' a plain honest man who would gov- 
ern by a good homely rule, sweep away abuses, and see 
that no more tricks were played by superior cunning 
upon the people. To rule, a multitude must be incar- 
nate in a man, and the American multitude was incar- 
nate in Andrew Jackson." 

Continuing, Mr. Smith says of the inaugura- 
tion of Jacksonian rule : 

" The seat of government having been stormed by 
General Jackson and his train was at once given up to 
pillage. ... A ruthless proscription swept the Civil 
Service to make places for Jackson's political soldiery. 
. . . No merit or record would save you. . . . Those 
who could get access to Jackson had a chance of escap- 
ing by appeals to his vanity. One official is said to 
have saved his head by begging for the old hero's old 
pipe. Thus was inaugurated the spoils system, together 
with the trade of place-hunting, by a President who 
came probably with a sincere desire of clearing govern- 
ment from corruption and of making simple honesty the 
rule, and of whom it must in justice be said that his 
own hands were perfectly clean." 

The social orgy that accompanied Jackson's 
installation is graphically described : 

"After the inauguration came a reception. There 
was orange punch by the barrelful, but as the waiters 
opened the door a rush was made, the glasses were 
broken, the pails of liquor were upset, and the sem- 
blance of order could be restored only by carrying tubs 
of punch into the garden to draw off the crowd from 
the rooms. Men stood in muddy boots on the damask- 
covered chairs to get a sight of the President. ' The 
reign of King Mob seemed triumphant,' says Judge 
Story, who was glad to escape from the scene." 

In short, Old Hickory " went in " amid a storm 



of disorder almost rivalling that of a heated ses- 
sion of the British House of Commons though 
our author does not make the comparison. 

William Henry Harrison, the (largely in- 
voluntary) hero of the coon -skin, log- cabin,, 
and hard -cider campaign, a candidate popu- 
larly believed to be even more enchantingly 
plebeian than Old Hickory himself, is summar- 
ily treated : 

" But Jackson's success had taught the wire-pullers 
the value of availability. . . . An available man they 
found, and a counter-charm in all respects to the ' Old 
Hero ' and ' Old Hickory,' in ' Old Tippecanoe,' the 
name which, most happily for electioneering purposes, 
they gave to William Harrison, a worthy old country 
gentleman in Ohio, who in a combat at Tippecauoe 
gained a victory over the Indians. . . . ' Tippecanoe ' va- 
cated life and the Presidency a month after his inaugur- 
ation." 

The midsummer madness of the " hard-cider 
campaign " naturally strikes Mr. Smith with 
wonder : 

" What the Harrisonian frenzy denotes in its relation 
to American character it is not easy to say. Had the 
American people traversed in half a century the whole 
distance between the phlegmatic Englishman and the 
wild shouter for Tippeeanoe, or was this strange out- 
burst of political poetry a recoil from a too prosaic 
life?" 

Mr. Bryce, we remember, was moved to a sim- 
ilar question by the spectacle of some 60,000 
ordinarily rational men marching ankle-deep 
in the mud to the inspiring refrain of " Blaine, 
Blaine, James G. Blaine," etc. 

The author justly devotes much space to 
Thomas Jefferson who " of all American 
statesmen," he thinks, "has left the deepest im- 
pression on the character of his people ": 

" Their political ideas and hopes, their notions about 
their own destiny and the part which -they are to play 
in the drama of humanity, have been his. . . . Yet 
with all his outward simplicity the Virginian magnate 
and man of letters, though he might be a Republican, 
could not in himself be a true embodiment of democ- 
racy. He was the friend of the people, but not one of 
them. From him to the rough warrior of Tennessee, 
the hard-cider drinking pioneer of Ohio, and the rail- 
splitter of Illinois, there was still a long road to be 
travelled. . . . Jefferson's wand was the pen. Yet he 
is strangely apt to fall into mixed metaphors and even 
into platitudes. This address [the inaugural] has not 
escaped criticism. A constellation goes before the peo- 
ple and guides their steps. In the sequel the constel- 
lation becomes a creed, a text, a touchstone, and should 
the people wander from their ' touchstone ' they are 
conjured to ' retrace their steps and regain the road.' 
In the genius of a man who made so vast an impres- 
sion on such a nation we must believe, yet it is some- 
times an exercise of faith to believe in the genius of 
Jefferson for anything but party management and per- 
sonal fascination." 

Mr. Smith's estimate of Henry Clay, the 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



183 



anti-British " war-hawk " leader, naturally falls 
considerably short of the traditional one : 

" Clay was perhaps the first consummate party leader 
of the Congressional and platform type. He was a 
paragon of the personal fascination now styled magnet- 
ism. Magnetic, indeed, his manner and voice must 
have been if they could make the speeches that he has 
left us pass for the most cogent reasoning and the high- 
est eloquence. . . . His power of winning the hearts 
of men was unique. When at last he missed his prize 
by losing the election for the Presidency his partisans 
wept like children; one of them is said to have died of 
grief. He was ardently patriotic, after the war-hawk 
fashion, but the Presidency was always in his thoughts 
and its attraction accounts for the perturbations of his 
political orbit. He said that he would rather be right 
than be President; but it has been too truly remarked 
that even at the moment of that memorable utterance he 
was thinking more of being President than of being 
right. His policy and sentiments were intensely Amer- 
ican, and by the cosmopolitans would now be designated 
as jingo." 

The portrait of Washington does not mate- 
rially differ from the familiar one though the 
following unpalatable, if too true, passage re- 
calls Carlyle's threat to " take George down a 
peg or two ": 

" Washington insisted that his officers should be gen- 
tlemen, not men fit to be shoe-blacks. He drew a most 
undemocratic distinction between the officer and the pri- 
vate soldier. . . . He says that the soldier should be 
satisfied to serve for his food, clothes, and pay, and com- 
plains that he cannot lay on the back of the insubordin- 
ate patriot more than one hundred lashes, holding that 
five hundred are not too many." 

With a view, perhaps, of turning the virtues 
of the Father of his Country partly to British 
account, Mr. Smith continues : 

" Some American writers seem anxious to prove that 
Washington's character is essentially different from that 
of an English gentleman. About this we need not dis- 
pute. The character of an English gentleman is cer- 
tainly devoid of any traits that might be derived either 
from a plantation or from a war with Indians in the 
backwoods. Yet an English gentleman sees in Wash- 
ington his ideal as surely as he does not see it in Frank- 
lin, Samuel Adams, or Patrick Henry." 

Certainly few will deny that Washington had 
more in common with Hamilton (the high-bred 
statesman who answered a democratic senti- 
ment by striking the table and saying, " Your 
people, sir, your people is a great beast ! ") 
than with " Tippecanoe " or " Old Hickory " 
or even with the rail-splitter of Illinois, who 
in some respects towers above them all. 

Daniel Webster, Mr. Smith thinks, " as an 
orator of reason, has no superior if he has an 
equal in the English language ": 

" It is difficult at least to say what political speech 
can vie in logical force and impressiveness with his 
.speech defending the Union in reply to the Southern 
.separatist Hayne, or what forensic speech excels in the 



same qualities his speech for the prosecution in the mur- 
der case of White." 

After quoting from the former speech Mr. 
Smith adds : 

" These words thrilled through all American hearts 
at the same time, remained engraved on all American 
hearts forever. . . . He swayed the opinions of all men ; 
but he did not, like Clay, win their hearts. He never 
was a great party leader, nor was he ever a hopeful can- 
didate for the Presidency. It must be added that his 
moral strength was not equal to his power of mind. In 
regard to the great moral question of slavery, his de- 
sire of the Presidency at last overcame his principle." 

After briefly depicting the characters of Ben- 
ton and Calhoun, Mr. Smith passes on to Ran- 
dolph : 

" A Virginian of high family, with more than the ar- 
rogance of his class, who used to come into the Senate 
in his hunting-dress with his hunting whip in his hand, 
and behave as if he were in his kennel; a man of nat- 
ural ability, without good sense or power of self-control, 
firmly attached to no party or even opinion, keen and 
reckless in invective, the terror of those at whom his 
lean finger was pointed in debate, at last a political 
wreck and almost a maniac. Randolph sometimes told 
wholesome truths in a pungent way." 

It is upon Lincoln that the author bestows 
his most unstinted and heart-felt praise : 

" Abraham Lincoln is assuredly one of the marvels 
of history. No land but America has produced his like. 
This destined chief of a nation in its most perilous hour 
was the son of a thriftless and wandering settler, bred 
in the most sordid poverty. . . . He had a strong and 
eminently fair understanding, with great powers of pa- 
tient thought which he cultivated by the study of Euclid. 
In all his views there was a simplicity which had its 
source in the simplicity of his character. . . . Both as 
an advocate and as a politician he was ' honest Abe.' 
As an advocate he would throw up his brief when he 
knew that his case was bad. ... He said himself that 
he had not controlled events, but had been guided by 
them. To know how to be guided by events, however, if 
it is not imperial genius, is practical wisdom. Lincoln's 
goodness of heart, his sense of duty, his unselfishness, 
his freedom from vanity, his long-suffering, his simpli- 
city, were never disturbed either by power or by opposi- 
tion. ... To the charge of levity no man could be less 
open. Though he trusted in Providence, care for the 
public and sorrow for the public calamities filled his 
heart and sat visibly upon his brow. His State papers 
are excellent, not only as public documents, but as com- 
positions, and are distinguished by their depth of hu- 
man feeling and tenderness from those of other states- 
men. He spoke always from his own heart to the heart 
of the people. His brief funeral oration over the graves 
of those who had fallen in the war is one of the gems 
of the language." 

Of paramount interest to Americans will be 
the author's account of the struggle for inde- 
pendence and of the causes that lead up to it. 
Here Mr. Smith's conflicting sympathies have 
made his task a hard one. He has evidently 
meant to be impartial ; but the American 
reader, fed on what Mr. Smith terms the pane- 



184 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



gyrical histories, will certainly lament a ten- 
dency throughout this chapter to show the 
seamy side of the Colonial coat, to belittle Co- 
lonial motives and Colonial successes, and to 
explain away British reverses. Mr. Smith 
seems to us, we confess, loth to admit that 
the colonists were capable of grasping a prin- 
ciple fully at first, or of fighting for it steadily 
afterwards. He lays perhaps too much stress 
upon Colonial " niggardliness and fractious- 
ness," and too little upon parliamentary greed. 
The specious and familiar plea of the French 
War expenses is urged, and the colonists' re- 
ply that the war was forced on them and was 
in fact largely paid for by them in blood and 
treasure, is omitted. Besides, the French War 
had nothing to do with the constitutional point 
involved. Mr. Smith finally admits, however, 
that the tea-tax (a measure insidiously framed 
to smuggle in a principle fatal to American 
liberties) was resisted, not because it was bur- 
densome, but because it was illegally laid. It 
seems to us, on the whole, pretty well settled 
that the prime cause of the rupture the vio- 
lence of which, only, Mr. Smith laments was 
the sudden awakening of British greed to the 
prosperity (and therefore the taxability) of 
the once ignored, colonies. We need not, 
however, multiply arguments that will suggest 
themselves to every American reader, but we 
shall devote our remaining space to brief cita- 
tion from the author's account of the matter. 
That the cause of the revolt was not, Mr. Smith 
thinks, "general oppression by the mother coun- 
try seems clear." But he goes on to say : 

" The restrictions upon Colonial trade and manufac- 
tures were a cause for the most reasonable discontent. 
The restrictions on trade might be excused by the dom- 
inant fallacies of a protectionist era and palliated by 
the commercial privileges and bounties which the col- 
onies enjoyed. Those on manufactures were without 
palliation or excuse, imposed solely in the interest of 
the manufacturer at home. These grievances, if redress 
had been obstinately refused, would have justified re- 
volt." 

We cannot admit the author's implication that, 
in the face of the sinister tea-tax, ministerial 
pledges against the re-imposition of specific 
duties were a guaranty against the results of a 
policy of fiscal extortion plainly entered into 
by a parliament which, to quote Mr. Smith, 
" Made itself the legislative organ of a commercial in- 
terest, animated by that blind and unscrupulous greed 
which has been the bane and disgrace of commerce and 
continues to animate the monopolist at the present day." 

Touching the measures of repression that 
followed the " Boston Tea Party " the author 
observes : 



" They were passionate, indiscriminate, and insult- 
ing; bolts of blind wrath launched across the Atlantic 
by men imperfectly informed as to the situation and 
ignorant of the character of the people, as transoceanic 
rulers must always be." 

Passing on to the war itself, Mr. Smith does- 
not forget to observe that " Never, not even 
under Newcastle, did England make a worse 
show in the field," a plea which reminds us, 
we confess, of the familiar excuse of the de- 
feated pugilist that he was " out of condition." 
" Perhaps in the whole conflict," the author 
thinks, 

" The three noblest things are the character of Wash- 
ington, the behavior of his army at Valley Forge, and 
the devotion of the better class of loyalists." 

Commenting on the severe treatment of the 
loyalist class at the close of the war, he sig- 
nificantly adds : 

" The loyalist exiles peopled Nova Scotia, New Bruns- 
wick, and Upper Canada with enemies of the new Re- 
public, and if a power hostile to the Republic should 
ever be formed under European influence in the north 
of the continent, the Americans will owe it to their an- 
cestors who refused amnesty to the vanquished in civil 
war." 

The execution of Andre is commented on 
with some severity ; and Mr. Smith forgets to 
mention here that this deplorable observance 
of an unrelenting code was partly a Mosaic re- 
prisal for the hanging of Nathan Hale. 

The following summary of the Revolutionary 
War is one of the few unfortunate instances ia 
which the author allots his prejudices to in- 
fluence, if not, perhaps, his conclusions, at least 
his manner of stating them. The passage ha& 
an ungenerous, even a peevish, ring : 

" No conflict in history has made more noise than the 
Revolutionary War. It set flowing on every fourth of 
July a copious stream of panegyrical rheloric which ha* 
only just begun to subside. Everything connected with it 
has been the object of a fond exaggeration. Skirmishes 
have been magnified into battles and every leader has 
been exalted into a hero. Yet the action, and, with one- 
grand exception, the actors, were less than heroic, the 
ultimate conclusion was foregone, and the victory after 
all was due not to native valor but to foreign aid." 

We cannot help thinking, however, that "na- 
tive valor " had some influence on the result ; 
and it may be added that " foreign aid " was 
not secured until all doubt as to " native valor " 
and its chances of ultimate success were set at 
rest by the disastrous defeat of Burgoyne at 
Stillwater. 

Of the author's rather hurried account of 
the Civil War, we need only say that it does 
full and sometimes eloquent justice to the brav- 
ery and the motives of the citizen-soldiery of 
both sides. Mr. Smith's view of the conflict is.

very different from, for instance, that of Car- 
lyle, _who devoted laudatory volumes to the 
wars waged by an illiberal and unpatriotic ty- 
rant for the possession of what he considered 
his patrimony, but who affected to see in this 
modern struggle of a great people for national 
purity and unity, only the " burning of a dirty 
chimney " a nuisance to be abated by the joint 
efforts of the neighbors who were annoyed by 
it. Touching the personnel of the armies, Mr. 
Smith notes the pregnant fact that " in intelli- 
gence no army, except perhaps the Athenian, 
can have ever equalled or approached that of 
the North." 

The volume is, as we have said, of especial 
interest to Americans, written, as it is, from 
the novel standpoint of a loyal yet liberal En- 
glishman who admires our institutions and be- 
lieves in our future, yet is zealous to point out 
and emphasize our debt to the mother country. 
No other book, we think, covers the field with 
the same conciseness, epic continuity, and fresh- 
ness of view. In the preface the author prom- 
ises that should his book prove successful it 
may be followed by a companion volume, on 
the same scale, dealing with recent history and 
current questions. The contingent promise 
may be taken as a positive one, for it is a fore- 
gone conclusion that the present work will be 
widely read.

PROBLEMS OF RAILWAY 

When Bacon congratulated his countrymen 
upon being the " least bitten in purse " of any 
people in Europe, no one could foresee the ex- 
tent to which English capitalists were destined, 
three centuries later, to be mulcted to sup- 
port the pretentious and sometimes nefarious 
schemes of American railroad " promoters." 
The migratory habits of English capital pre- 
sented the opportunity, and the facile methods 
of the modern stock exchange provided the 
machinery, through which the process was ac- 
complished. Under the pressure of declining 
profits at home, a heavy flow of English cap- 
ital set toward this counti-y soon after the open- 
ing of our first great era of rapid railway ex- 
tension in the early fifties. The collapse of 
'57 checked, but did not stop, this movement ; 
and through large parts of the succeeding de- 
cades English and other European capital con- 
tinued to supply, in no slight degree, the sub-

stantial basis upon which some of our boldest 
railway projects were undertaken. The ill- 
timed character of many of these enterprises, 
and the destructive methods of management 
pursued by so many of our early railway man- 
ipulators, destined the expectations of the for- 
eign investor to frequent and bitter disappoint- 
ment. And when the awakening came, as it 
did, once in the seventies, and again in the 
eighties, a confident hopefulness which never 
had a rational basis was followed by an excess of 
timidity which was quite as irrational though 
not less natural. A succession of chills was 
sent through the European market for Amer- 
ican investments, from the last of which recov- 
ery is still to come. Few of our railroad se- 
curities to-day enjoy the credit in the European 
market to which their intrinsic merit fairly en- 
titles them. The English investor who contents 
himself with three and four per cent on Brit- 
ish and French railroad stock, demands a net 
return of from four to five and one-half per 
cent from American railroad bonds. This dif- 
ference in tlje credit of securities possessing 
the same essential qualities cannot be altogether 
explained by the fact that the course of English 
prices for our securities is held down by the 
American quotation ; it is due, first and last, 
to lack of confidence a lack of confidence 
which, because of its exaggerated nature, is as 
prejudicial to the real interests of the Euro- 
pean investor as it is injurious to the market 
for American securities. 

Mr. Van Oss, an Englishman, has in his 
work on "American Railroads and Invest- 
ments " made an attempt to remove this dis- 
trust and to enable the European investor to 
appreciate the advantage of American railway 
investments, by supplying him the material for 
the formation of an intelligent estimate of their 
character and worth. In executing his task, 
however, Mr. Van Oss has produced a book 
that will have an interest for a much wider cir- 
cle of readers than the investing public ; and 
it is this feature that entitles his work to more 
extended notice. It is not only a storehouse 
of information regarding the history, manage- 
ment, and affairs of the forty-five leading rail- 
road companies brought under review, but it is 
altogether the best discussion of the general 
conditions, past and present, affecting the value 
of American railroad securities, with which we 
are acquainted. On this side it may be re- 
garded as a contribution of importance to a de- 
partment of railroad economics that has never 
received adequate attention. It is not the work

of a scientific investigator, but it is a clear, 
strong, discriminating, and impartial examina- 
tion of an important part of the subject-matter 
of railway finance. 

There are three principal points of view 
from which the activities of the railroad may 
be studied, and each of these corresponds to a 
different set of relations sustained by the rail- 
road to those interested in it. These are, re- 
spectively, the relations of the railroad to the 
shipper, to the investor, and to the state. The 
interests of the shipper and of the investor have 
usually been treated as distinct and separate, 
and they are very generally supposed to be an- 
tagonistic. In fact, however, these two inter- 
ests are closely interlaced, and require, for their 
complete understanding, to be studied in com- 
bination. What is called the " railroad prob- 
lem " is, on the scientific side, little more than 
a search after the principle determining the 
true equilibrium of these two interests, and, on 
the practical side, the effort to strike the bal- 
ance between them. (Those who despair of 
solving the problem hope at lea*st to destroy it 
by dissolving one of the interests and substi- 
tuting state ownership and management.) But 
most writers have approached the question with 
little direct reference to the investor ; and thus, 
despite its undoubted importance for a full com- 
prehension of all the equities of the case, the 
subject of railway finance has been neglected. 
A few brief allusions to the complexities of 
railroad accounting, and an explanation of the 
juggle by which a road could conceal and sup- 
port an unsound financial condition by charg- 
ing dividends to construction account, have hith- 
erto been thought sufficient. And a similar 
indifference to the interests of the investor has 
characterized the attitude of government, at 
any rate in the United States. In England, 
as a result of the revelations of the railway 
panic of 1866, the Railway Securities Act was 
passed, to provide some protection to the inves- 
tor against the recurrence of similar abuses. 
But in America, the investor, representing, ac- 
cording to recent statistics, a nominal capital 
of not less than ten billions, or one-tenth of the 
nation's wealth, was left to devise his own safe- 
guards. By a very natural blunder, it was 
thought not to be possible to materially advance 
the interests of the investor without injuring 
those of the public. The investor, it was ar- 
gued, is interested in high rates and pools to 
maintain them ; the shipper, on. the contrary, 
in low rates and the competition that produces 
them. The public has failed to grasp the con- 



nection between revenue and rates ; the error 
it has persistently made is in supposing that 
large revenues imply high rates. The fact that 
this conclusion was contradicted by the whole 
history of railway development in America 
counted for nothing, because it accorded so com- 
pletely with popular prejudice against the 
" money power." But the public was not alone 
in the error. The investor has seldom taken 
a more accurate view of his relations to the 
shipper through the medium of rates. The as- 
serted antagonism has also been accepted by 
him as an undoubted fact. And now the au- 
thor of the present work has brought the weight 
of his authority to the support of the view 
" that with regard to rates the interest of the 
railways are conflicting with those of the pub- 
lic." The railroad is simply typical of that 
large and growing class of industries in which 
permanent investment represents a heavy pro- 
portion of total working capital. Of these in- 
dustries as a class it is true that expenses do 
not vary proportionately with changes in the 
volume of business ; and it is to them that the 
important half-truth contained in the maxim 
" quick sales and low profits " is particularly 
applicable. But it is true in an especial de- 
gree of the railroad, that the expense per unit 
of traffic diminishes as the volume of traffic 
increases. And it is equally true that the 
amount of traffic varies inversely with rates, 
a low rate stimulating and a high rate retard- 
ing transportation. Rates, therefore, are only 
one of three elements affecting the net revenue 
of the railroad, the other two being expenses 
and traffic. To put the conclusion in the form 
of a mathematical statement, we might say that 
railway revenue is a fraction of three variables : 
expenses, rates, and traffic. And it will be 
seen to follow from this, that only within nar- 
row limits does the railway find its interest in 
fixing rates higher than the public interest re- 
quires. There is, therefore, little room or oc- 
casion for friction between the shipper and the 
investor. Of several different rates producing 
the same amount of gross revenue, the highest 
is obviously the most advantageous to the in- 
vestor ; for aggregate expenses then being rel- 
atively low, the margin of net revenue is in- 
creased. The highest rate that yields the max- 
imum revenue would seem to be the rule which 
an exclusive regard for the interest of the in- 
vestor prescribes to the railway management 
in fixing rates. What this rate would be in 
any particular case could only be experiment- 
ally determined, and then only with great dif-

ficulty. The lowest of the maximum revenue 
rates, on the other hand, most nearly accords 
with the interest of the shipper. Between those 
two limits rates might oscillate, the point at which 
temporary equilibrium would be reached being 
determined by the multitude of circumstances 
giving now the railroad and now the shipper 
the advantage of position in the bargaining. 
But the public would seldom find it to its per- 
manent interest to depress rates below the max- 
imum revenue point. This would endanger 
the value of the investor's interest ; and any- 
thing that tends to render returns upon rail- 
way investments inadequate is certain to react 
injuriously on the shipper's interest. 

The common complaint of railroads nearly 
everywhere in the United States to-day is that 
their earnings do not suffice to enable them to 
distribute " fair " dividends among their stock- 
holders. The fact to which they point as be- 
ing both the evidence and the cause of this con- 
dition is the low level of rates which rules here. 
Rates are, indeed, extremely low in this country, 
the average rate per ton-mile in 1890 being 
considerably less than one cent. Rates here are 
forty per cent lower than in England, and almost 
as low as in Holland, where, owing to excessive 
water competition, rates are lower than any- 
where else in Europe. Equally significant is 
the rapidity with which the decline in rates has 
taken place. We have no exact statistics, but 
the experiences of two typical American roads, 
the New York Central in the East and the St. 
Paul in the West, seems to warrant the con- 
clusion that freight rates have declined about 
seventy-five per cent since the war ; and we 
have positive evidence that they have fallen no 
less than twenty-five per cent in the past twelve 
years. It is not surprising that such facts 
should be seized upon by managers to show 
why railroads are not more remunerative. It 
is a matter of great difficulty to trace the influ- 
ence of rates on earnings, but it may be confi- 
dently asserted that rates in the United States 
are considerably below the maximum revenue 
point. It is no sufficient answer to the con- 
tention of the railroads to say that the decline 
in rates has been compensated by the great 
growth of business. Mere increase of traffic 
could not of itself have saved the investor against 
the inevitable effects of declining rates. Earn- 
ings per mile of railway is the best, and indeed 
the only real, indication of the financial pros- 
perity of the road. Now, while there has been 
an almost phenomenal growth in the volume 
vof business during the past ten years a gain 



amounting to no less than one hundred per 
cent in the case of freight traffic there has 
been a steady decline of net earnings per mile. 
A part of the increase of traffic has no doubt 
been counterbalanced by the increase of mile- 
age ; but when due allowance has been made 
for the complication introduced by this factor, 
it still appears that, with a net gain of about 
thirty-three and one-third per cent of freight 
traffic alone over new mileage, there has been 
a decline of no less than twenty per cent in 
net earnings per mile. The increase in traffic 
has thus been more than offset by the decline 
in rates. And the reduction of net earnings 
would have been still greater had it not been 
for the marvellous economies effected in the 
cost of moving freight. Mr. Van Oss states 
the situation accurately when he says that " to 
offset the serious decline of earnings in spite of 
growing business has been the problem rail- 
road men in America found themselves con- 
fronted with." They have met the difficulty 
partly, but not altogether successfully, by cut- 
ting down the cost of transportation per ton- 
mile about one-half within the past twenty 
years. While, then, the enormous decline in 
rates produced a serious pro-rate reduction in 
the earnings from a given volume of traffic, 
the coincident concurrence of the two phenom- 
ena of growing business and cheapened cost 
prevented the margin of profits from being 
wiped out, and thus maintained the railways 
on a hardly less remunerative basis than for- 
merly. And to this extent the force of the 
contention that the constant decline of rates 
explains the inability of the railroads to earn 
" adequate " returns upon their capital is ob- 
viously weakened ; and more especially is the 
moral force of the contention destroyed when 
it is recalled that the railroads as a class are 
themselves largely responsible for the decline 
of rates which was simply the inevitable con- 
sequence of excessive construction and over- 
supply of transportation facilities. 

The American public has never been seri- 
ously disposed to deny the justice of the rail- 
roads' claim to earn adequate returns ; but it 
has refused to adopt the standard of adequacy 
proposed by the railroads. The people were 
not long in learning to appreciate the distinc- 
tion between returns upon capital invested and 
dividends on stock issued. They admitted the 
claim of the railroads with reference to the for- 
mer, but vigorously denied it as to the latter ; 
and, on the whole, with reason. The public 
knows that a formidable proportion of the cap- 



188 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1,. 



ital now nominally represented by American 
railways is fictitious. It is probably a conserv- 
ative estimate that places the proportion of 
" water " that was injected into the issues of 
American railroad companies, in the days when 
they were under the domination of cliques, at 
one-third of the total capitalization. But what- 
ever the proportion, it is safe to say, none of 
the abuses that have surrounded the financial 
management of American railways has done 
more to discredit their claims in the eyes of the 
public, and more certainly has been more pre- 
judicial to the interests of the bonajide inves- 
tor, than the evil of stock-watering. Not a few 
American railroads are still struggling with the 
difficulties emanating from this source. It is 
the immense amount of " water " they are car- 
rying that makes it impossible for some roads 
to bear up successfully under the pressure of 
declining rates. Excessive capitalization and 
excessive construction have been the twin evils, 
financially considered, of American railways. 
The latter has driven rates down, and the for- 
mer has kept dividends low. It is unnecessary 
to dwell on the various methods of stock- wa- 
tering developed by the ingenuity of American 
manipulators. It is more important to recall 
that the evil was one for which the laxity of 
the law was partly responsible. Nowhere else 
do railway directors enjoy such vast discretion- 
ary powers as in the United States. The law 
to this day imposes no serious restrictions upon 
their power to issue bonds and shares, to declare 
or pass dividends. The power has seldom been 
abused in the issue of bonds, but the extent to 
which share-capital was inflated to support 
speculative intrigues may be gathered from Mr. 
Van Oss's hardly exaggerated statement that 
" the majority of companies realized nothing 
for the shares they issued in their early days." 
The distinction between bonds and stock is an 
important one in American railway finance. 
The bondholder is a preferred creditor of the 
company, secured by a pledge of its property, 
and receiving a stipulated interest upon his 
loan. The stockholder is the owner of the 
road, his stock entitling him to share in the net 
profits. Nearly all American railroads were 
built with borrowed capital, for which bonds 
were issued, it usually being impossible to 
find a sufficient number of mere stockholders 
to advance the money. " To many, even bonds 
seemed no equivalent for their investment, and 
besides prior rights upon the property they 
also wished to possess control of the company ; 
and shares not being much sought after, it mat- 



tered little to the promoter whether he gave 
shares into the bargain with bonds or not." 
This was one of the most common and least ob- 
jectionable methods of stock-watering, although 
it frequently begot recklessness and dishonesty 
in the management of the property. Far more 
disastrous and reprehensible were fictitious is- 
sues of stock for the purpose of manipulating 
the market ; the payment of excessive prices 
for construction or for the purchase of other 
properties, for which bonds and stock were 
issued which the earnings of the company could 
not afterwards support. In these ways inves- 
tors wei-e deceived and plundered to carry out 
the " deals " of unscrupulous adventurers. 

But stock-watering may now be regarded as 
mainly an evil of the past. The great solidifi- 
cation of railway business and the undoubted 
improvement in the moral tone of railway man- 
agement, which have taken place in recent 
years, are a substantial guarantee that such 
malpractices as were common in the seventies 
will be difficult in the future. The only form 
of stock- watering of which we are likely to hear 
more is the issue of stock-dividends ; and, so- 
far as this is a device for concealing profits 
from public knowledge, it will be acceptable 
to the investor. There are even those among 
whom is Mr. Van Oss who think that, what- 
ever injury " water " may have been to inves- 
tors in the past, it is now a positive benefit. 
" Water emphatically begets a desire on the- 
part of railway managers to charge such rates 
as will pay returns upon fictitious capital." 
This view seems to us to be unduly optimistic 
and ill-founded. It overlooks the fundamental 
conditions determining rates, and, again, the 
real nature of the relation of rates to revenue. 
The " desires " of railway managers do not make 
rates. The decline of rates in this country has 
been due to over-building and excessive com- 
petition, rather than to lack of energy on the- 
part of managers. Mr. Van Oss, therefore,, 
writes very much more to the point when he 
says, " The future remunerativeness of Amer- 
ican railways depends chiefly upon the extent 
of future construction." This is the question 
of present and future importance to the inves- 
tor ; but to this question no very certain an- 
swer can be given. Present indications, how- 
ever, are that most American railroads will 
pursue a very conservative building policy in 
the future. The " boom" days are not yet of 
the past, but we may safely expect that rail- 
road extension will hereafter be undertaken 
less in anticipation of possible development and

more in response to calculable needs. Rates 
have probably reached their lowest, and as the 
country gradually grows up to the capacities of 
existing systems we may look for a slow rise. 
The present movement toward consolidation of 
railroad properties will doubtless exert an im- 
portant and healthful influence in these direc- 
tions. Increasing traffic, rising rates, dimin- 
ishing cost, such will be the probable future 
of the conditions on which the remunerative- 
ness of the railroads depends. But while this 
much is fairly clear, it would be rash to ven- 
ture an opinion, much more a prediction, as to 
how near or remote this future is.

A LIFE WORTH LIVING.* 

However cogent may be the pessimistic argu- 
ment for the worthlessness of life, it takes an 
essentially one-sided view of the matter. A 
man is not only an individual, but a factor in 
the social organism as well ; and the latter as- 
pect of his being is apt to be ignored by those 
who contend for the futility of human endeavor. 
In fact, Schopenhauer does imperfect justice 
even to the individual aspect of the problem, 
for he fails to give due weight to the individ- 
ual satisfaction of the altruistic life, to the deep 
inward joy that comes from strenuous endeavor 
towards the accomplishment of some worthy 
purpose, the joy to which we may deny the 
name of happiness only because that word is 
inadequate to give it expression, the joy for 
which Carlyle found the higher name of blessed- 
ness, and which Renan bade us seek when he 
gave us for a clue to the meaning of life that 
noble phrase : "II ne s'agit pas d'etre heureux ; 
il s'agit d'etre parfait." And, if the pessim- 
ist's view of life is thus discredited from the 
standpoint of individualism, it suffers all the 
more when examined from the standpoint of 
the social organization. Professor Huxley, in 
his Romanes lecture of last May, tells us that, 
" However diverse their views on philosophical and re- 
ligious matters, most men are agreed that the propor- 
tion of good and evil in life may be very sensibly af- 
fected by human action. I never heard anybody doubt 
that the evil may be thus increased, or diminished ; and 
it would seem to follow that good must be similarly sus- 
ceptible of addition or subtraction. Finally, to my 
knowledge, nobody professes to doubt that, so far forth 
as we possess a power of bettering things, it is our par- 
amount duty to use it and to train all our intellect and 
energy to this supreme service of our kind." 

*THE LIFE AND WORK OF JOHN RUSKIN. By W. G. Col- 
lingwood, M.A. Two volumes. Boston : Houghton, Miffiin 
&Co. 



Viewed from this objective standpoint, a life 
is clearly worth living if it sensibly alters " the 
proportion of good and evil in life " to the ad- 
vantage of the good. And the cases cannot be 
frequent in which such beneficent activity will 
fail to find its subjective value also, in the cre- 
ation of that state of ethical satisfaction which 
most serious souls have come to regard as more 
desirable than the palpable pleasures of sense, 
or even than the pure delights of the intellect. 
Some such reflections as these are sure to 
be aroused by a look at the life work of Mr. 
Ruskin, whose biography has recently been pre- 
pared for us by Mr. W. G. Collingwood, for 
many years his private secretary. They are as 
far as possible removed from " the barren op- 
timistic sophistries of comfortable moles," for 
they spring from a more searching analysis of 
life than mere optimism or mere pessimism has 
to offer. In the outlook of men like Mr. Ruskin, 
with whom high thought and noble deed go ever 
hand in hand, neither optimism nor pessimism 
can be a word of much meaning, for such men 
are as far removed in temper from the com- 
placency of the one as from the despair of the 
other. Mr. Ruskin displays, indeed, from time 
to time, those moods of .dejection from which 
few serious lives are wholly spared ; but with 
him the mood only serves to mark the transi- 
tion to some new phase of beneficent activity. 
Beginning with the beginning of 1871, the first 
series of " Fors," he says : 

" I simply cannot paint, nor read, nor look at min- 
erals, nor do anything else that I like; and the very 
light of the morning sky, when there is any which is 
seldom, now-a-days, near London has become hateful 
to me, because of the misery that I know of, and see 
signs of where I know it not, which no imagination can 
interpret too bitterly." 

But he quickly adds, lest despondency alone 
should seem to have been the outcome of thirty 
years of observation of men and labor in their 

behalf, 

" Therefore, as I have said, I will endure it no longer 
quietly; but henceforward, with any few or many who 
will help, do my poor best to abate this misery. But 
that I may do my best, I must not be miserable myself 
any longer; for no man who is wretched in his own 
heart, and feeble in his own work, can rightly help 
others." 

The literary charm with which Mr. Ruskin 
instinctively invests the most casual expression 
of his petulant moods, while it has brought 
his personality vividly before the minds of his 
readers, has also had the effect of obscuring 
their view of his serious work ; to a certain ex- 
tent it has produced a misleading impression 
of the dominant temper in which that work has.

been done. It is the merit of Mr. Colling- 
Wood's biography to have given us an essen- 
tially objective view of its subject, and such a 
view is needed to counteract that which we get 
from the self -revelations of " Fors " and " Prae- 
terita." Mr. Collingwood's book is based upon 
a larger collection of materials than any pre- 
vious biographer has had at his disposal, as well 
as upon the results of long personal intercourse 
with Mr. Ruskin and participation in his work. 
It is a straightforward chronological narrative, 
marred now and then by the writer's endeavor 
to be Ruskiniau on his own account, and occa- 
sionally uncritical in its acceptance of the most 
extreme Ruskinian doctrine, but a model, on 
the whole, of discreet and sympathetic delin- 
eation. It has a number of portraits and other 
illustrations, reproduces several hitherto un- 
published letters, and fills two octavo vol- 
umes, continuously paged. A minor point of 
excellence is found in the apt chapter-headings, 
such as the Rossettian : 

" Sighing, I turned at last to win 
Once more the London dirt and din," 

which marks Mr. Ruskin's transition from the 
role of art critic to that of social reformer, or 
the quotation from Ibsen " Hush ! you must 
not speak about it yet, but I have made a great 
discovery. The fact is that the strongest man 
upon earth is he who stands most alone " 
which is used to characterize Mr. Ruskin's atti- 
tude during the past quarter-century. 

" The happiest lot on earth is to be born a 
Scotsman," says Mr. R. L. Stevenson ; and the 
biographer places considerable emphasis upon 
Mr. Ruskin's Scotch ancestry. " The religious 
instinct so conspicuous in him is a heritage from 
Scotland ; so is his conscience and code of mor- 
ality, part emotional, part logical, and often 
unlike an Englishman's in the points that sat- 
isfy or shock it. The combination of shrewd 
common-sense and romantic sentiment ; the 
oscillation between levity and dignity, from 
caustic jest to tender earnest ; the restlessness, 
the fervor, the impetuosity, all these are char- 
acteristics of a Scotsman of parts, and highly 
developed in Ruskin." Possibly Mr. Colling- 
wood makes too much of this notion of " the 
recrudescence of the Celt," but it must be per- 
mitted to have some weight. The influence of 
Mr. Ruskin's parents had much to do with the 
development of his character, and his devotion 
to them while living, and to their memory af- 
terwards, finds many a beautiful illustration 
in his writings. Yet his intellectuality was too 
forceful to develop in any mould planned by 



others, and the inmost law of his being com- 
pelled him to grow away from the paths that 
his parents would gladly have seen him pursue 
to the end. The following is Mr. Collingwood's 
comment upon this silent tragedy so common 
and so inevitable in an age, like ours, of rap- 
idly widening thought the tragedy that pro- 
vided Tourguenieff with a theme for one of his 
greatest works : 

" The gradual enlargement of his ideas and sphere of 
thought involved a gradual estrangement from his pa- 
rents; much more painful than any sudden revolt, be- 
cause then they would have known, so to speak, the 
worst, and some sort of reconciliation on a new basis 
would have been possible. As it was, they saw or 
thought they saw, for they could not tell how it would 
end their work being gradually undone, their cher- 
ished hopes frustrated, their intentions unfulfilled. And 
all their pride in his fame, and their confidence in his 
dutiful affection, could not hide the fact that, once 
launched on his life's true career, he had drifted away 
from their track, out of their sight, voyaging through 
strange seas of thought, alone." 

Mr. Collingwood makes some excellent ob- 
servations upon Mr. Ruskin's relations to the 
Pre-Raphaelites. Attention is called to the fact 
that, as a boy, when he first got permission to 
copy at the Louvre, he chose a Rembrandt. 
This shows, says the author, " what the casual 
reader of his works on art might miss, that he 
is naturally a chiaroscurist, and that his praise 
of the Pre-Raphaelite color and draughtsman- 
ship is not prompted by his taste and native 
feeling so much as by intellectual judgment." 
We doubt, indeed, if it shows all this, but the 
incident is noteworthy. The following remarks 
may be given a less qualified assent : 

" Pre-Raphaelitism was an unstable compound, liable 
to explode upon the experimenter, and its component 
parts to return to their old antithesis of crude naturalism 
on the one hand, and affectation, whether of piety or 
poetry or simple reactionary antiquarianism, on the 
other. And that Mr. Ruskiu did not then foresee. All 
he knew was that, just when he was sadly leaving the 
scene, Turner gone and night coming on, new lights 
arose. It was really far more noteworthy that Millais 
and Rossetti and Hunt were men of genius, than that 
the ' principles ' they tried to illustrate were sound. 
And Mr. Ruskin, always safe in his intuitions, divined 
their power, and generously applauded the dextrous 
troop in their unexpected lampadephoria." 

The Pre-Raphaelite episode is but one of many 
illustrations of adherence to the central prin- 
ciple of Mr. Ruskin's art teaching, " the great 
doctrine that art cannot be produced except by 
artists, . . . that, just as Socrates postponed 
the day of justice until philosophers should be 
kings, and kings philosophers, so Ruskin post- 
poned the reign of art until workmen should be 
artists, and artists workmen." Of this prin-

ciple, and of the other principle that all true 
art presupposes a certain moral temper in the 
artist and in his public, Mr. Ruskin, whatever 
the vagaries of his criticism, has always been 
the uncompromising defender. 

In reading these volumes, one cannot fail to 
be deeply impressed by the phenomenally va- 
ried activity of Mr. Ruskin's intellectual life. 
Of this we have a striking illustration in a let- 
ter to Carlyle, written at the age of thirty-six. 
The letter, which is too long for us to print, de- 
scribes the occupations of the year six hun- 
dred pages of " Modern Painters," thirty new 
drawings, some etchings on steel, designs for 
the Oxford Museum, special studies of naviga- 
tion and Spanish proverbs, a new classification 
of plants, the rearrangement and cleaning up 
of his collection of minerals, investigations in 
political economy and German metaphysics, 
and supervision of the work of a number of 
pupils humorously concluding, " and various 
little by things besides. But I am coming to 
see you." This letter is paralleled, twenty years 
later, by the following : 

" I begin to ask myself, with somewhat pressing 
arithmetic, how much time is likely to be left me, at 
the age of fifty-six, to complete the various designs for 
which, until past fifty, I was merely collecting material. 
Of these materials I have now enough by me for a most 
interesting (in my opinion) history of fifteenth-century 
Florentine art, in six octavo volumes; an analysis of the 
Attic art of the fifth century B. C., in three volumes; 
an exhaustive history of northern thirteenth century 
art, in ten volumes; a life of Sir Walter Scott, with 
analysis of modern epic art, in seven volumes; a life of 
Xenophon, with analysis of the general principles of ed- 
ucation, in ten volumes; a commentary on Hesiod, with 
final analysis of the general principles of political econ- 
omy, in nine volumes; and a general description of the 
geology and botany of the Alps, in twenty-four volumes." 

The prophetic aspect of Mr. Ruskin's thought, 
which was, during his later years, to overshadow 
all others, came frequently into view, even dur- 
ing the earlier years of art study and criticism. 
As early as 1845, he wrote to Joseph Severn 
in terms that showed clearly enough the direc- 
tion towards which his view of society was 
turning : 

"With your hopes for the elevation of English art 
by means of fresco I cannot sympathize. ... It is not 
the material nor the space that can give us thoughts, 
passions, or power. I see on our Academy walls noth- 
ing but what is ignoble in small pictures, and would be 
disgusting in large ones. ... It is not the love of fresco 
that we want; it is the love of God and his creatures; 
it is humility, and charity, and self-denial, and fasting, 
and prayer; it is a total change of character. We want 
more faith and less reasoning, less strength and more 
trust. You want neither walls, nor plaster, nor colors 
ca nefait rien a Vaffaire: it is Giotto, and Ghirlandajo, 



and Angelico that you want, and that you will and 
must want until this disgusting nineteenth century has. 
I can't say breathed, but steamed its last." 

All the promise of " Fors " was in these early 
vaticinations ; " so early had he taken up, and 
wrapped around him, the mantle of Cassan- 
dra." From this time on, his ethical ideals grew 
until they almost usurped the place of the merely 
artistic ideals with which he set out in his ca- 
reer. That this career was a consistent develop- 
ment from then until now is one of the main 
contentions of his biographer, and to have made 
this clear is not the least of Mr. Collingwood's 
services. Near the close of the book, when 
dealing with the charge of insanity that has 
more than once been brought against Mr. Rus- 
kin, the writer says : 

" The careful student should be able to trace his 
genius, down to the end, in continuous and rational pro- 
gression. Passing over defined intervals of mental dis- 
ease, and allowing for vehemence of expression, partly 
characteristic, partly the temporary effect of the pen- 
umbra of the storm-cloud, his mental development, 
I make bold to say, is normal and logical throughout 
his life. And I believe that when his work can be 
looked back upon as a whole, with proper understand- 
ing of its environment and with full knowledge of its 
circumstances, the common reproach of insanity made 
against each new manifestation of his mind will then be 
scorned as an exploded prejudice." 

All the stories of Mr. Ruskin's alleged insan- 
ity are based on nothing more substantial than 
the attacks of brain fever which at times threat- 
ened his life. Mr. Collingwood, who appears 
to have been at his side upon at least one of 
these occasions, writes very beautifully of this 
delicate subject : 

" All that I now remember of many a weary night 
and day is the vision of a great soul in torment, and 
through purgatorial fires the ineffable tenderness of the 
real man emerging, with his passionate appeal to jus- 
tice and baffled desire for truth. To those who could 
not follow the wanderings of the wearied brain it was 
nothing but a horrible or grotesque nightmare. Some, 
in those trials, learned, as they could not otherwise have 
learned, to know him, and to love him as never before." 

Many of Mr. Ruskin's readers recur more 
frequently to " Fors " than to any of his other 
writings, for they find in that series of dis- 
jointed outpourings a more candid revelation 
than elsewhere of the man whom they love and 
reverence above all other Englishmen now liv- 
ing ; a form of utterance from which they may 
almost pluck out the heart of the mystery con- 
cealed within his complex personality. It is 
interesting to note with what quick sympathy 
Carlyle responded to the appeal of " Fors." 
Such a tribute as the following letter, from the 
man whose spirit Mr. Ruskin always felt most 



192 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



akin to his own, must have been peculiarly 
gratifying to its recipient : 

" This ' Fors Clavigera,' Letter 5th, which I have just 
finished reading, is incomparable; a quasi-sacred con- 
solation to me, which almost brings tears into my eyes ! 
Every word of it is as if spoken, not out of my poor 
heart only, but out of the eternal skies ; words winged 
with Empyrean wisdom, piercing as lightning, and 
which I really do not remember to have heard the like 
of. Continue, while you have such utterances in you, 
to give them voice. They will find and force entrance 
into human hearts, whatever the ' angle of incidence ' 
may be; that is to say, whether, for the degraded and 
inhuman Blockheadism we, so-called ' men,' have mostly 
now become, you come in upon them at the broadside, 
at the top, or even at the bottom. Euge, Euge ! " 

As we all know, " Fors " was but the intellec- 
tual expression of a very practical plan, the 
" St. George's Work." That in faith without 
works there can be any saving grace whatever, 
is a notion that Mr. Ruskin has always scorn- 
fully repudiated. At one time, we find him 
scrubbing the staircase of an Italian inn ; at 
another, road-mending at Hinksey ; at an- 
other, keeping clean a London street-crossing ; 
at another, carrying on a model tea-shop ; at 
still another, teaching in the night schools. 
The " St. George's Work " was an attempt to 
systematize the energies thus scattered, to en- 
list the support of others, and thus to accom- 
plish on a large scale what hitherto he had 
done upon a small scale by personal effort. The 
inner meaning of the " St. George's Work " is 
thus well described : 

"He aimed at the gradual introduction of higher 
aims into ordinary life ; at giving true refinement to the 
lower classes, true simplicity to the upper. He pro- 
posed that idle hands should reclaim waste lands; that 
healthy work and country homes should be offered to 
townsfolk who would 'come out of the gutter.' He 
asked landowners and employers to furnish opportuni- 
ties for such reforms; which would involve no elaborate 
organization nor unelastic rules simply the one thing 
needful, the refusal of commercialism." 

For nearly a quarter-century now the work of 
the St. George's Company has been carried on 
by a small but enthusiastic band of earnest re- 
formers ; it has indeed languished during the 
Master's recent years of illness, but it has not 
been abandoned, and can make a creditable 
showing for itself. It may yet be destined to 
illustrate the parable of the grain of mustard 
seed. 

As was to be expected of a biographer hav- 
ing such close personal relations with his sub- 
ject, Mr. Collingwood gives us many familiar 
glimpses of the Master. These begin with the 
Oxford lecturer of 1870, of whom we are told : 

" He used to begin by reading, in his curious intona- 
tion, the carefully-written passages of rhetoric, which 



usually occupied only about the half of his hour. By 
and by he would break off, and with quite another air 
extemporize the liveliest interpolations, describing his 
diagrams or specimens, restating his arguments, reen- 
forcing his appeal. His voice, till then artificially ca- 
denced, suddenly became vivacious; his gestures, at 
first constrained, became dramatic. He used to act his 
subject, apparently without premeditated art, in the live- 
liest pantomime. . . . Lecturing on birds, he strutted 
like the chough, made himself wings like the swallow; 
he was for the moment a cat, in explaining that engrav- 
ing was the art of scratching. If it had been an affec- 
tation of theatric display, we ' emancipated schoolboys,' 
as the Master of the University used to call us, would 
have seen through it at once, and scorned him. But it 
was so evidently the expression of his intense eagerness 
for his subject, so palpably true to his purpose, and he 
so carried his hearers with him, that one saw in the 
grotesque of the performance only the guarantee of an- 
other and serious side." 

The chapter on u The Diversions of Brant- 
wood " is full of these reminiscences. For one 
picture we may find space : 

" In the morning you may be waked by a knock at 
the door, and ' Are you going out ? ' And pulling up 
the blind, there is one of our Coniston mornings, with 
the whole range of mountains in one quiet glow above 
the cool mist of the valley and lake. Going down at 
length on a voyage of exploration, and turning in per- 
haps at the first door, you intrude upon the Professor 
at work in his study, half sitting, half kneeling at his 
round table in the bay window, with the early cup of 
coffee, and the cat in his crimson arm-chair. There he 
has been working since dawn, perhaps, or on dark morn- 
ings by candle light." 

The story of the illiterate mason is so charac- 
teristic that we must quote it : 

" Once, when new buildings were going on, the ma- 
son wanted an advance of money, which Mr. Ruskin 
gave him, and then held out the paper for him to sign 
the receipt. A great deal of hesitation and embarrass- 
ment ensued, somewhat to Mr. Ruskiu's surprise, as he 
knows a north-countryman a great deal too well to ex- 
pect embarrassment from him. At last the man said, 
in dialect: 'Ah mun put ma marjc.' He could not 
write. Mr. Ruskin rose at once, stretched out both 
hands to the astonished rustic, with the words: 'I am 
proud to know you. Now I understand why you are 
such an entirely good workman.' " 

In 1889, Mr. Ruskin was visited with severe 
illness, which kept him in close confinement 
for a year. Since then, he has been gradually 
but steadily improving in health, and the biog- 
rapher's latest report is in cheerful strain : 

" Nowadays, he seems, in all but the power of resum- 
ing work, himself again, though aged and feeble. He 
comes downstairs late, walks out morning and evening 
by the lake shore, not so often now climbing up the 
moor, or boating on the lake. He reads the newspapers 
and books, and spends the evening in the old way in 
the drawing-room, rarely without music and chess. He 
visits his neighbors, and is glad to see intimate friends 
and young people; but he has hardly strength for the 
distinguished stranger, or the admirer from a distance. 
Remembering all he has passed through, his friends

should not be surprised if he shrinks from visits of 
curiosity and inspection, however kindly meant. He 
retains a vivid memory and interest in many things; 
and, when the company is genial and the subject rouses 
him, talks as brightly as of old. There are not wanting 
signs of reserve power which encourage the hope that 
many years are in store for him of rest after toil, and 
tranquil light at evening time." 

With a picture thus fair and peaceful linger- 
ing before the vision, we close this record of a 
noble life, fervently echoing the prayer that no 
new storm-cloud may appear to mar the beauty 
of its setting. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Edmund Gosse's 
new volume 

zy? " 



The trend of Mr. Edmund Gosse's 
sheaf of essays in contemporary crit- 
icism is sufficiently indicated in their 
collective title, " Questions at Issue " (Appleton). 
Contemporary wrangling over floating literary is- 
sues, the mere attack and rejoinder of heated dis- 
putants, is apt to bewilder rather than satisfy. It 
is from the critic who is a non-combatant, who gets 
above the sphere in which the controversy is con- 
ducted, and who (on the excellent critical principle 
of " reculer pour mieux sauter") starts afresh from 
the common point of departure of the contestants, 
that we are to look for light. In the present vol- 
ume Mr. Gosse has maintained pretty constantly 
the critical attitude indicated ; hence the reader 
may expect to gain from him a clear idea of the 
general nature of the issues treated, and perhaps a 
glimmering notion as to their final solution. The 
papers are, of course, gracefully written, combining 
seriousness of aim with the conversational tone and 
" the absence of all pedagogic assertion" (the au- 
thor's phrase) which are indispensable in the treat- 
ment of current themes. There are twelve essays 
in all " The Tyranny of the Novel," " Has America 
Produced a Poet ? " " What Is a Great Poet ? " "Is 
Verse in Danger ? " " Tennyson And After," 
" The Limits of Realism in Fiction," etc. The 
reader, by-the-bye, need not take alarm at the flavor 
of chopped hay possibly lingering about the last 
title. From Mr. Gosse's rather ironical little paper 
on " Making a Name in Literature " we may cite 
ithe following comments on Mr. E. P. Roe " a na- 
tive author called Roe," as Mr. Arnold icily phrased 
it : " There are certain books which are not wel- 
comed by the reviews, and which fail to please or 
even to meet the eye of experts in literature, which 
nevertheless, by some strange and unaccountable 
attraction, become known to the outer public, and 
are eagerly accepted by a very large circle of read- 
ers. I am not aware that the late Mr. Roe was 
<ever a favorite with the writing or speaking critics 
of America. He achieved his extraordinary suc- 
cess not by the aid, but in spite of the neglect and 
disapproval, of the lettered classes. I have no close 



acquaintance with Mr. Roe's novels, but I know 
them well enough to despair of discovering why 
they were found to be so eminently welcome to 
thousands of readers. . . . It is their lack of sa- 
lient character that makes me wonder what enabled 
them to float where scores and scores of works not 
appreciably worse or better than they have sunk." 
The key to the problem which Mr. Gosse " despairs 
of " is a sufficiently simple one ; and he may find 
it concisely, if somewhat too harshly, stated in 
Schopenhauer. 

We gladly bespeak the favor of our 

j. readers for Mrs - Schuyler Van Rens- 
selaer's little treatise " Art Out of 
Doors" (Scribner). The book is essentially a plea 
for good taste in gardening, full of practical hints 
and sound conclusions, and soberly and persua- 
sively written. . In America, as the author points 
out, the truth of the Baconian maxim that "men 
come to build stately sooner than to garden finely " 
is often unpleasantly manifest. The fact that garden- 
ing, like architecture, is an art, with a definite group 
of principles and precedents, has scarcely yet dawned 
upon us ; and hence our parks and cemeteries, the 
grounds about our country-seats, and our lesser 
lawns and garden-patches, display solecisms to a 
degree that would not be tolerated in our buildings. 
" A glance," says the author, " at any American 
town or summer colony of villas shows how defi- 
cient we are when we deal with natural objects." 
Having demonstrated the fault, with sound logic 
and abundant citation of examples, Mrs. Van Rens- 
selaer turns to the remedy. She discusses in detail 
the treatment of grounds, roads, and paths, and the 
disposal of pattern-beds, trees, shrubs, piazzas, etc., 
with intelligent enthusiasm, and with a commend- 
able loyalty to the principle that the study of " Na- 
ture unadorned " lies at the root of sound art. A 
handsome tribute is paid incidentally to Mr. Olm- 
sted, " the most remarkable artist yet born in Amer- 
ica," whose taste has created, in the World's Fair 
site and ensemble, such an impressive object-lesson 
in the scope and possibilities of landscape garden- 
ing. A pungent chapter (which might have been 
profitably extended ) is devoted to " Out- Door Mon- 
uments." Mrs. Van Rensselaer decides that " the 
proportion of bad monuments to good ones in any 
American city to-day is probably at least ten to 
one "; and we may add that the proportion is not 
likely to improve until members of committees hav- 
ing charge of such matters are chosen on some more 
pertinent principle of selection than their general 
social or commercial prominence. Several notably 
bad monuments are cited the " ridiculous figure " 
of Burns and the commonplace one of Seward in 
Central Park ; the badly -placed Gettysburg statue ; 
the ugly urns, "suggestive only of the forty thieves," 
in Druid Park, Baltimore, etc. We were rather 
surprised at the omission from this list 'of the strange 
nondescript (labelled "Columbus") that claws the

Clout* Myths " The ClaS8ic M y ths in En S Hsh Lit ' 

in English erature " (Ginn), by Prof. Charles 

Mills Gayley, is a work for which 
teachers of literature in our colleges and secondary 
schools should be very grateful. Neglect of the clas- 
sical languages is fast making a sealed book, for the 
majority of our students, of many of the best passages 
of English literature. Professor Gayley does not 
believe that the study of classical myth, otherwise 
than in the forms of speech that first give it shape, 
can ever be entirely satisfactory ; but he does be- 
lieve that something may be done to improve a 
situation that is fast becoming intolerable. Some- 
thing, at least, of the spirit of classical literature 
may be imparted by an intelligent and sympathetic 
English presentation of its substance. " Such sec- 
ond-hand study must," he admits, " be ever a make- 
shift, for the literature of a people inheres in its 
language." " But in dealing with the purely imag- 
inative products of antiquity, the difficulty of the 
translation may be moderated if those products be 
reproduced, so far as possible, not in the prosaic but 
in the poetic atmosphere, and in the imaginative 
garb of modern art." As the author puts it in an- 
other passage : " If our American pupils and many 
of their teachers cannot quaff Massic and Faler- 
nian, they do well to scent the bouquet." Professor 
Gayley's book, better than any other with which 
we are acquainted, will enable them to " scent the 
bouquet "; it is based primarily upon Bulfinch, but 
the matter is so enlarged and rewritten as to make 
a new and original work. It presents the classical 
myths in attractive description, and illustrates them 
by numerous passages of the best English poetry. 
It also gives references to many others too long for 
inclusion. The range of these illustrations is wide, 
and comes down to very recent work. We have 
tested the matter with a number of poems rather 
out of the way of most readers, and in every case 
have found them mentioned if not actually quoted 
by the author. We are glad that the quotations 
are so numerous, as, for younger students, they pro- 
vide the best sort of material for memoriter work. 
And we must reproduce the excellent doctrine of 
the writer upon this very point. He says : " With 
all our study of children and our gabble about 
methods of teaching them, while we insist, properly 
enough, that youth is the seed-time of observation, 
we seem to have forgotten that it is also the har- 
vest time of memory. It is easy for children to re- 
member what they learn, it is a delight for them 
to commit to memory ; we act criminally when we 
send them forth with hardly a fact, or a date, or a 
glorious verse, in the memory of one out of ten of 
them." The book has apparatus of all sorts a 
full commentary, genealogical tables, rules for pro- 
nunciation, maps, illustrations, and careful indexes. 



Pro/. Freeman'* The late Professor Freeman's " His- 
Federai Gov emmeni tory of Federal Government " \vas r 
as all historical students know, aban- 
doned at the close of the first volume, published in 
1863. For many years following, the subject of 
the Norman Conquest absorbed the author's atten- 
tion, and the completion of his great study of that 
subject left him with other interests more pressing 
than those connected with the unfinished earlier 
work. So the " History of Federal Government " re- 
mained a fragment and has for many years been out 
of print. Mr. J. B. Bury, of Trinity College, Dub- 
j lin, has now presented us with a new edition of this 
work, which, in spite of its unfinished condition, is 
of the first importance to the student of political 
institutions. Freeman's original plan is sufficiently 
stated in his own introductory chapter, or even in 
the continuation of his title, which ran " from the 
foundation of the Achaian League to the disruption 
of the United States." For this part of the title he 
has been often, and we think unfairly, censured. 
That the United States were disrupted in 1863 is 
a historical fact ; that they were to become reunited 
two years later was by no means clearly to be fore- 
seen, and famous historians have made far greater 
errors of judgment than that of Freeman when he 
expressed a belief in the permanence of the disrup- 
tion. The plan of his work contemplated a survey of 
federal institutions as chiefly illustrated by the four 
significant examples of Greece, Switzerland, the 
Netherlands, and our own country. It will ever be 
a matter of regret that the work should have stopped 
short at the treatment of the Greek federations. The 
present edition contains, in addition to the text of 
the first, a chapter on " the defective forms of fed- 
eralism which have appeared in Italy," and so the 
work has been given the new title, " History of Fed- 
eral Government in Greece and Italy" (Macmil- 
lan). It contains also a fragment on the German 
Confederacy, an editorial preface, a full analysis of 
contents, a careful index, and a twenty-page appen- 
dix of additional notes by the editor. That it is 
one of the most readable and suggestive of all mod- 
ern works upon political history goes without saying.

dred double-columned pages, is evident. Our com- 
mercial relations with the Spanish countries of 
America are every year growing in importance, and 
technical terms are constantly employed in invoices 
and commercial correspondence. The general dic- 
tionaries offered no assistance in such matters, and 
many a correspondence is carried on at cross pur- 
poses for lack of just such precise information as 
Seilor de Leon's exhaustive work provides. It must 
speedily find its way to every business office in 
which Spanish letters are received and answered. 

Wide apart as are the theories of 

An excellent book r . . , 

on the Formation the Constitution expressed in the two 
volumes, Professor Hart's Forma- 
tion of the Union, 1750-1829 " (Longmans) makes 
a, worthy companion to Professor Wilson's " Divis- 
ion and Secession," already reviewed in these col- 
umns. Professor Hart's is the better theory, yet it 
is saying much to accord to his book the same praise 
lately given to its sequel. He has already estab- 
lished a reputation as a clear-headed and vigorous 
writer, and his new volume bears out this conception 
of him. The opening chapter, on the Americans 
in 1750, is an admirable description, to be com- 
pared with the later section on " The People of the 
United States in 1789." The writer has purposely 
avoided making a military history of a period 
largely characterized by prolonged wars, and he 
deserves thanks for dwelling the rather on the polit- 
ical features of the period chronicled. The unity 
of the somewhat scattering Colonial era is kept in 
view by continual reference to European ambitions, 
and the cause of the final revolt is truly found, not 
in the extent but in the nature of Colonial grievances. 
The section on the " Sources of the Constitution " 
preserves an admirable balance between radical 
views, and finds in the Colonial past the larger 
sources of the newer construction rather than in the 
British Constitution on the one hand or the invent- 
ive brains of 1787 on the other. 



An account 
of FroebeVs 
life and work. 



" Froebel and Education by Self Ac- 
tivity " is the title of an excellent lit- 
tle volume by Mr. H. Courthope 
Bowen in the series of " Great Educators " ( Scrib- 
ner). Mr. Bowen is well qualified for writing 
such a compendious account of Froebel's work and 
thought, by a lifelong interest in the subject, by 
much study of Froebel's principles and methods 
both in books and in the kindergarten, and by hav- 
ing frequent occasion to lecture on Froebel at Lon- 
don, Cambridge, and elsewhere. Two chapters of 
the little book are devoted to Froebel's life, and the 
remaining seven to his ideas as expressed in his 
writings, conversations, and schools. Appendix A 
gives a complete list of Froebel's writings, and Ap- 
pendix B a classified and annotated list of books on 
Froebel recommended by Mr. Bowen to students. 



The volume is likewise provided with an index. 
No teacher ought to be without some account of the 
life and works of the great educational reformer, 
and this book commends itself as affording both a 
brief introduction to the whole subject and the in- 
formation needed in case one wishes to make more 
exhaustive studies. 



Essays and 



" Let Him First Be a Man, and Other 
papers of inter- Essays " (Lee & Shepard) is the 

title given by Mr. W. H. Venable, 
the veteran educational speaker and writer, to a mis- 
cellaneous collection of talks and papers prepared 
for teachers' journals and institutes. Here are es- 
says on " Schoolmastery," on " Books and Reading," 
on " The History of Education," on " The Utility 
of the Ideal," on " Sylvan Poetry, Mythology, and 
Sentiment," and a " Memorial Address on Wil- 
liam Downs Henkel." These papers are packed 
with prose and poetical citations and allusions, and 
couched in the pithy and sparkling style so much 
prized by teachers' associations. They are full of 
sensible and interesting observations adapted to en- 
courage and inspire the young to higher ideals of 
culture. The book has all the variety of a news- 
paper, while its style and tendency are far more im- 
proving. 

"Camp-fires of a Naturalist" (Ap- 

Narrativeof * . V, 

a North Ameri- pleton) is the graphic story ot Pro- 
fessor Lewis Lindsay Dyche's four- 
teen expeditions after North American mammals- 
compiled by Clarence E. Edwords from the Pro, 
fessor's field-notes and diary. The book deals 
solely with facts, nothing having been added, as 
the author tells us, to make the story " more inter- 
esting or exciting." Mr. Edwords's style, in point 
of adaptation to matter, could scarcely be bettered. 
The book has the right ring of the off-hand camp- 
fire " yarn "; and its obvious truth lends to it an 
interest lacking in more lurid narratives. The brief 
sketch, in the opening chapter, of Professor Dyche's 
early career is sufficiently impressive, and offers a 
useful and not too obtrusive moral to younger read- 
ers, to whom we especially commend the book. 
There are a number of illustrations of varying merit. 

Mr. William Henry Bishop's "A 
House-Hunter in Europe " (Harper) 
is a cheery, chatty volume, pleasantly 
written, and full of practical information withal. 
Sensible American tourists who wish, while abroad, 
to avoid cosmopolitan hotels, and to really rub 
elbows with the people of the countries they visit, 
may find here an array of useful facts as to Euro- 
pean house rentals, servants' wages, food expenses, 
plans of apartments, etc. The burden of Mr. Bish- 
op's book is not, however, house-hunting ; he has 
really given us a capital travel-book or, rather, 
an account of the five years' sojourn of an Amer- 
ican literary man in some of the most attractive 
parts of Europe. The frontispiece furnishes a charm- 
ing view of the author's quarters at Nice.

BRIEFER MENTION. 

" THE Professor," Charlotte Bronte's earliest novel, 
interesting chiefly because it foreshadows the crowning 
masterpiece of her almost unparalleled genius, has 
been added to the exquisite new edition of the Bronte 
sisters, published by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. (Mac- 
millun). Another volume of this edition includes the 
poems of the three sisters, as well as the "Cottage 
Poems" (1811) of their father, the Rev. Patrick 
Bronte. Finally, " Wuthering Heights " and " Agnes 
Grey " fill two other volumes of this edition. As for 
the similar edition of Fielding, it has just been aug- 
mented by " Tom Jones," in four volumes. 

MR. W. Outram Tristram's " Coaching Days and 
Coaching Ways" (Macmillan) has reached, as it well 
deserved, a new edition, and in its present crown octavo 
form, at a reduced price, makes one of the most attract- 
ive of simple gift-books. The illustrations by Mr. Hugh 
Thomson and Mr. Herbert Railton, which adorn a large 
proportion of the pages, are everywhere and always a 
delight. The style of this new edition is similar to that 
in which the same publishers have given us " Cran- 
ford " and " The Vicar of Wakefield." 

LOWELL'S " Conversations on Some of the Old Poets " 
was published in 1845, and has been out of print for 
many years. The author did not think it worth re- 
printing, but a Philadelphia publisher (McKay) has 
thought differently, and reproduced the work in a form 
closely matching the collective edition of Lowell's works. 
Mr. Robert Ellis Thompson, who writes an introduction 
for the edition, tells us how he got hold of the book in 
his college days, and " shared in that glow Mr. Stead- 
man [sic] speaks of as felt by students of a still earlier 
time." Many readers will be glad to have the book 
thus made accessible, although it only represents the 
author's immaturity, the period when he was fledging his 
critical wings. 

"A PRACTICAL Course in English Composition" 
(Ginn) by Prof. Alphonso G. Newcomer, is a useful text- 
book upon a somewhat original plan. It is neither a 
rhetoric nor a grammar, but aims instead " to show the 
student how simple a thing it is to find material " for 
essays, and " how easy and delightful it is to work that 
material into good, interesting compositions." It gives 
practical directions for the narrative, descriptive, per- 
suasive, and argumentative forms of composition, as well 
as for some of the styles of newspaper writing. Miss 
Mary F. Hyde's " Advanced Lessons in English " (Heath) 
is a little book upon the same general subject, but strictly 
grammatical in its treatment. 



YORK TOPICS. 

New York, Sept. 26, 1893. 

It is now almost a year since the writer of these 
notes, observing the ruinous discounts and extremely 
long credits given in certain sections of the publishing 
trade, was led to predict the succession of failures 
among weaker houses which has since taken place. 
This prophecy accidentally got into print, and as far 
as it was noticed at all it was made light of at the 
time. It is easy to see now, however, that the pub- 
lishing business was passing through the same condi- 
tions of inflation from which all trades have experienced 
so serious a reaction. Loss of confidence precipitated 



a crisis, but the time was no doubt ripe for a change. 
Less than two months ago a number of the largest 
publishing houses in the country were seriously consid- 
ering the advisability of throwing over a goodly pro- 
portion of their Fall books into the next year. Perhaps, 
this has been done to some extent, but a glance at the 
season's announcements indicates a determination to 
carry out arrangements already made. I am informed 
by more than one leading New York firm of publishers 
that their orders are larger than were expected, and 
that in Chicago and vicinity especially, the business is 
almost normal. If a halt has been called to the reckless 
competition in discounts and credits, the panic will not 
have been without its benefit. 

Resident literary men have scarcely begun to return 
to town from their summer outings such of them as 
were able to take outings this year. Not all of them 
are as fortunate as Mr. Frank R. Stockton, whose out- 
ing lasts the year round. He has a country home at 
Convent, N. J., and is rarely seen in the city. His 
place is called " The Holt," and there he raises flowers, 
fruits, and vegetables, for his own and his friends' use. 
No announcement of his literary plans is obtainable 
beyond the volume of short stories already mentioned 
in THE DIAL, soon to be published by Messrs. Charles. 
Scribner's Sons. 

Some interesting announcements are made for the 
literary celebration of the centenary of the death of 
Madame Roland the famous leader of the Girondists, 
in the French Revolution, whose execution by the guil- 
lotine (Nov. 8, 1793), at the hands of extremists of her 
own party, was the occasion of the memorable excla- 
mation, "O Liberty! what crimes are committed in thy 
name! " The " Life and Letters " of Madame Roland 
will soon be published; and an early number of "Scrib- 
ner's Magazine " will give an article on the same sub- 
ject by the same biographer, who has had free access 
to the family papers. A selection from the letters will 
appear in the magazine. 

The announcement of an acting version of Mr. 
Aldrich's " Mercedes," by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co., has called special attention to the fact that that 
play has been put on the season's repertory of Mr. A. 
M. Palmer's stock company. Miss Julia Arthur's ap- 
pearance as " Mercedes" at the production of the drama 
in this city last Spring added considerably to her pres- 
tige as an actress. The company began a tour of the 
country, at Brooklyn last week; and it was well worth 
a pilgrimage to the sister city to see once more the 
almost perfect rendering of the little play. The latter 
requires the simplest yet the most finished acting. The 
performance will be given some two or three times 
during the company's stay in Chicago. 

The exhibition of English Pre-Raphaelite paintings,, 
given at Philadelphia and New York last Winter, is 
recalled by the numerous volumes concerning the move- 
ment, and the reprints of books by members of the 
group, about to be published. The most important of 
these is the new work by Holman Hunt, which is looked 
for with the deepest interest by old disciples of the 
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and by novitiates created 
last year. Next in interest is the Macmillan reprint of 
Christina G. Rossetti's "Goblin Market and Other 
Poems," to be illustrated by Lawrence Housman. Put- 
nam also will reprint Rossetti's " House of Life" in their 
" Literary Gems " series. 

The literary and artistic activity of Dr. Edward 
Eggleston and his daughters is emphasized by a new 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

volume in which all three are concerned, shortly to be 
published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. "The Story 
of Washington" is written by Elizabeth Eggleston 
Seelye, edited by Edward Eggleston, and contains about 
a hundred illustrations by Miss Allegra Eggleston. It 
is expected that the book will supply a demand for a life 
of Washington the man, of convenient size, not only 
popular but also including the latest results of research. 

Mrs. Elizabeth Cavazza, whose sketches of Italian 
life have attracted wide attention, will soon begin in 
the " Atlantic Monthly " a three-part story entitled 
" The Man from Aidone," a study of Sicilian life among 
the peasants and in the sulphur mines. Love and 
tragedy fill the pages of what is probably Mrs. Cavaz- 
za's most important contribution to fiction. Her real- 
istic stories are the more remarkable from the fact that 
the author is American by birth, and has never visited 
Italy. Having married an Italian gentleman, she will 
make her first trip to that country this Winter. Mrs. 
Cavazza has always been a resident of Portland, Me., 
and has had a close friendship with the Lonfellow and 
Whittier families, from whom she received helpful 
advice in her early literary work. 

Mr. Arthur Sherburue Hardy has settled into his 
editorial duties at " The Cosmopolitan " office so quietly 
that people scarcely realize that he is now a permanent 
factor in New York literary life. As for the magazine 
itself, I learn that it was necessary to stop printing 
the September number, containing the World's Fair 
articles and illustrations, in order to get the October 
number published. Orders for some forty thousand 
copies have been left unfilled. The illustrations of the 
World's Fair in the magazines, it may be said, have been 
as a whole very artistic and suggestive, but I have seen 
nothing that could compare with the series of heliotype 
views given in recent numbers of the "American Archi- 
tect." The original photographs evidently have been 
taken after the grounds were put in perfect shape, and 
they give one who has not seen the Exposition a realiz- 
ing sense of its beauty which has not been obtained 
elsewhere. It is to be hoped that the decorative work 
at the Fair by our American artists may be reproduced 
in the same fashion. ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



Professor Huxley's " Collected Works " are to be pub- 
lished by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. in the " Eversley " 
style of their Kingsley, Church, and Morley. 

It is said that Mr. P. G. Hamerton has written his 
autobiography, and deposited it in his publisher's safe, 
there to remain until after the author's death. 

Mr. Andrew Lang's Christmas book for this year will 
be called " The True Story Book," and its contents will 
range from Thermopylae and the finding of Vinland to 
events of our own century. 

Dr. Jessopp and Mr. Gosse are at work upon a life 
of Donne. Dr. Jessopp wrote the article on Donne in 
the " Dictionary of National Biography," and possesses, 
moreover, a number of his unpublished manuscripts. 

" My Arctic Journal," by Mrs. Lieutenant Peary, is 
announced for early publication by the Contemporary 
Publishing Company. It will be illustrated by the 
remarkable photographs taken by Mr. and Mrs. Peary 
in Northern Greenland. 



We learn from the London "Bookman" that M. 
Bourget's visit to this country is the result of an 
arrangement with the editor of the New York " Her- 
ald," and is to result in an American society novel, to 
be published in that newspaper. 

"The National Observer," in consequence of the 
scarcity of new publications during the dull Summer 
season, filled one of its recent numbers with reviews of 
old books, such as "Ivanhoe," "In Memoriam," and 
Macaulay's " History," done in the modern style. 

An English publisher announces a translation of 
Ibsen's "Brand," by Professor C. H. Herford. We 
have often questioned the possibility of translating 
" Brand " into English verse at all adequate to the form 
and thought of that poem, but if Mr. Herford's work 
shall prove to have been done throughout upon the 
plane of the fragment published in " The Contemporary 
Review " a year or two since, he will deserve the heart- 
iest of congratulations. 

Mr. Norman Gale, in the London "Academy," makes 
the following suggestive comparison between the minor 
poets of England and America: "Are the writers of 
American minor verse, taken in the lump, better than 
their English relations, or do the oversea publishers 
behave more warily than those in London? Probably in 
the midst of a practical, mechanical people the muse of 
song finds fewer open houses. One thing is certain: 
the volumes of verse that are visitors to our shores 
strike a better average than do the abundant books of 
rhyme that, coming from our own presses, exceed the 
hairs of the head in multitude." 

The London " Literary World " is the source of the 
following bit of information: "The great edition of 
Plato's Republic, to which, as is well known, Professors 
Jowett and Lewis Campbell have been devoting them- 
selves for some years, will see the light very shortly. 
It was an open secret in Balliol at the time of the 
Master's severe illness eighteen months ago, that one 
of the chief anxieties of his physicians arose from the 
patient's absolute determination to get up and work 
sometimes for several hours at MSS. or proofs. And 
Professor Campbell, too, has found an active man's 
consolation for retirement in the magnum opus." 

The French courts have recently decided that agree- 
ments between author and publisher are strictly per- 
sonal, the ground of the judgment being that the author 
chooses his publisher, for his own personal reasons, as a 
quasi-collaborator ; whereas the reputation and acts of any 
substituted publisher might be morally and materially 
damaging to the book and its success. The point was 
also laid down that it would be unfair to subject any 
author and his works to the transfers to which the busi- 
ness of a publisher is exposed. The case arose from the 
publication, by the successors to the business of Dentu, 
of a new edition of the " lambes " of Auguste Barbier. 

Mr. Roden Noel was with John Addington Symonds 
at the time of the latter's death, and, in " The Gentle- 
man's Magazine," thus writes of his interment: "An- 
gelo and I helped to put him in his coffin, and drove 
with him across Rome in the night at 3.30. It was 
quite dark, but as we came near the Protestant Cemetery 
the dawn began to glimmer above the buildings of the 
Palatine and through the arches of the Colosseum ; a rare 
bird woke and twittered in the cypress trees; long 
wreaths of white mist wavered close to the ground. ...

spot in that most lovely cemetery. The birds sang inces- 
santly all through the funeral." 

An eight-volume series of " Periods of European 
History" is in preparation by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 
The works will embody the results of the latest investi- 
gations, and will contain references and notes. The 
volume treating of the Seventh Period, A. D. 1789- 
1815, by Mr. H. Morse Stevens, has been issued, and 
that on the First Period, A. D. 476-918, by Mr. C. W. 
C. Oman, is nearly ready. The second Period, A. D. 918- 
1272, is by Mr. T. F. Tout; the third, A. D. 1272-1494, 
by Mr. R. Lodge; the period A. D. 1494-1598, by Mr. 
A. H. Johnson; from A. D. 1598-1715, by Mr. H. O. 
Wakemau; from A. D. 1715-1789, by Mr. A. Hassall; 
and the eighth and concluding Period embraces the 
history of Europe from 1815 to 1893. The general 
editor is Mr. Arthur Hassall, and his co-laborers are 
all well known for their studies in the departments they 
have chosen. 

Lady Shelley, says the London " Athenaeum," has 
given to the Bodleian Library, on conditions, an exten- 
sive collection of MSS. relating to the late Percy 
Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Wollstonecraft 
Shelley, consisting of letters written by them or ad- 
dressed to them, as well as original MSS. of Shelley's 
poems, and the original Diary kept by Mrs. Shelley, 
together with a number of copies of the impression of 
the same privately printed by the late Sir Percy Shelley. 
The principal conditions which Lady Shelley desires to 
be strictly observed are: that all these documents, ex- 
cept MSS. of poems and such letters as have already 
been printed by Mrs. Shelley in her edition of her hus- 
band's prose works or in Prof. Dowden's Life, should 
until the centenary of Shelley's death in 1922 be kept 
apart, and not be allowed to be seen by any person ex- 
cept the Curators and Bodley's Librarian, and that no 
copy of any portion of them should be taken by any one. 

WHITTIER'S LOVE OF HOME. 

Whittier, as is well known, was no traveller. It is 
doubtful if he was ever outside of New England. His 
home attachment was a passion, and he had little wish 
to roam. Mrs. Mary B. Claflin, in her " Personal Rec- 
ollections of Whittier," lately published by Messrs. T. 
Y. Crowell & Co., gives an interesting passage on this 
phase of the poet's character: 

"He was sensitive to every change of temperature and 
seemed to be constantly longing for the summer air, the 
blooming flowers, and the singing birds. He suffered in the 
cold, bleak winds of New England, and often said : ' It must 
be confessed we have a hard climate. I always wish the 
Pilgrims had drifted down to Virginia.' But his love for 
Massachusetts and Essex County wasfereater than his dis- 
like of the long winters and the rough gales. The sunniest 
climes and the richest landscapes could not win him from his 
loyalty to his home, for he found every charm of beauty 
and grandeur in its rugged scenes. The Merrimac was more 
to him than the Rhine, and Chocorua and Mount Washington 
more than the splendors of the Jungfrau and the Matter- 
horn. Not the Bay of Naples nor the Bosphorus could 
rival in his affections the North Shore and the expanse of 
foam-crested waters about the Isles of Shoals. A friend whom 
he greatly admired, in answering some inquiries of his as to 
her birthplace in another State, added : ' But my ancestors 
lived in Manchester-by-the-Sea.' ' Oh,' he exclaimed, ' I knew 
thee was from Essex County.' " 

ORGANIZATION AMONG LITERARY WORKERS. 
Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, in some appreciative 
comments on the Literary Congress at Chicago last 
July, printed in " Harper's Magazine " for October, gives 



the following sensible observations on the benefits that 
might be derived from organization among literary 
workers : 

' ' Perhaps the time is not yet ripe for an effective literary Con- 
gress. But the time is evidently at hand for general confer- 
ences of the literary men and women who use the English 
language. Literature pure and simple is not organized, and 
the workers in it are without standards, and without the ben- 
efits of conference and cooperation. Philology, folk-lore, Old 
English, etc., have their societies of mutual comparison and 
aid ; there are even historical associations upon a scientific 
basis. Literature is unorganized. It is probably incapable of 
scientific organization and cooperation from its nature. But 
the great body of writers of English literature can certainly 
gain power and encouragement by conferences if not by for- 
mal organization. . . . 

" The value of the Chicago conference is in the suggestion 
of the possibility of impressing literary workers with their 
increasing responsibility in their increasing opportunity, and 
of elevating the literary standard of the English-reading 
world. If five hundred of the producing authors of America 
had come together at Chicago and conferred seriously upon 
this subject would they not have gained strength and clarity 
of purpose, and would not the effect have been felt through- 
out the country ? Would not personal contact and compar- 
ison of views have resulted in some sort of inspiration ? Would 
not such a Congress in London, even if confined to fiction and 
belles-lettres, raise the profession in dignity, and profoundly 
impress the English-reading world ? Why, in respect to such 
conferences, should literature be an exception to all the sci- 
ences, and to technical literary scholarship? " 

ACCORDING TO STANDPOINT. 

Two well-dressed Americans were overheard narrat- 
ing to each other their experiences as visitors to Chi- 
cago. " The greatest thing I have seen here," said one, 
" is the Stock Yards. I was down there yesterday watch- 
ing them killing hogs. They would yank a hog by the 
heels, stick him, tumble him into hot water, and scrape 
him, all inside of a minute. I'm sure some of 'em were 
alive yet when their bristles were taken off." The other 
man laughed heartily, as though in admiration both of 
the efficiency of the process and of the joke on the hogs. 
" Yes," said he, " Chicago is a smart town! It beats the 
world, I reckon! " 

A man with foreign dress and accent was heard, at 
the Parliament of Religions, explaining the failure of 
Christianity in India. " The conditions and standards 
of our country," said he, " are different from those of 
yours. Your Chicago slaughter-houses are a shame and 
a curse to civilization. A religion which allows such 
things cannot be understood and is not wanted in the 
East." 

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. PETER. 

The following sonnet, apropos of one of the most cel- 
ebrated of recent " finds," is from a volume of verse 
just published in England by Mme. Darmesteter (A. 
Mary F. Robinson): 

" To-morrow or in twenty centuries 
The sudden falling open of a lid 
On some gray tomb beside the Pyramid 
May bring the first Evangel to our eyes. 

" That day, who knows with what aghast surprise 
Our priests shall touch the very deeds He did, 
And learn the truth so many ages hid, 
And find, perchance, the Christ did never rise. 

"What then? shall all our faith be accounted vain? 
Nothing be left of all our nights of prayer ? 
Nothing of all the scruples, all the tears, 
Of endless generations' endless years ? 
Take heart ! Be sure the fruits of these remain. 
Hark to the Inner Witness : Christ is there ! "

HYMN OF THE HARVEST. 

Now to thee, gracious Lord of the seasons, be honor and glory 

and praise, 
That again in the joy of the harvest our jubilant anthem we 

raise. 

Though many the fears that beset us, though faith waxes 
feeble and cold, 

Thy bow, with its promise unbroken, glitters still as it glit- 
tered of old. 

Though weary we grow in our watching the weeks of the 

drought as they pass, 
When the earth is as iron beneath us, and the heaven above 

us as brass. 

Yet the showers come back in their season ; once more in the 
land there is seen 

The brook brimming over with crystal, the grass as the emer- 
ald green. 

Though troubled the spirit within us, when the mist upon val- 
ley and plain 

Lies thick, and the clouds in their armies return again after 
the rain. 

Yet the sun cometh forth as a giant, and after the tempest 

the morn 
Is cloudless and fair, and the color grows golden and rich on 

the corn. 

For seed time and harvest we thank Thee ; our fears as the 

shadows have fled ; 
Thou hast given his seed to the sower, Thou hast given the 

eater his bread.

DAVID BALFOUR. 


Being Memoirs of his Adventures at Home and Abroad. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
"Lovers of fiction have a great treat before them when they sit down to read 'David Balfour.' We have not hesitated to compare Mr. 
Stevenson with Scott when Scott is at his best, nor shall we hesitate to compare him with Thackeray, even in ' Henry Esmond, 1 though a better 
book with which to compare this marvellous story would be ' Barry Lyndon.' " R. H. Stoddard in Matt and Express. 


THE WATCHMAKER'S WIFE, 


MEN OF ACHIEVEMENT. 


And Other Stories. By FRANK R. STOCKTON. 12mo, cloth,

By EYRE CROWE. With 12 Illustrations. Small 4to, $2.00. 
New and charming glimpses of the great novelist are given in this chatty and readable book of Mr. Crowe, the artist who accompanied 
Thackeray on his journeyings in this country. The rapid and graphic narrative also describes the writer's own very lively impressions of the 
country and people of forty years ago. 
" A book that no lover of Thackeray will be willing to leave unread. Not only is it interesting for the near view it gives of the author of 
' Vanity Fair,' but for the picture it paints of the United States forty years ago." Critic.

THE WRITER AND HIS HIRE. 

The notion that literary work should not be 
done for pay, that it should be exempted from 
the commercial conditions under which man 
ordinarily does service to his fellows, is one 
that frequently finds expression (and some- 
times most unexpectedly) among professional 
men of letters. It has more than once proved 
an obstacle in the path of the London Society 
of Authors, and has probably been among the 
causes that have thus far prevented an effect- 
ive similar organization of the literary workers 
of our own country. Mr. Walter Besant has 
done yeoman service in combating this idea 
among Englishmen, but it seems to have some- 
thing of the hydra's vitality, and the severance 
of one head is but the signal for another to 
rear its crest. A recent deliverance upon this 
subject is to be found in the last issue of " Scrib- 
ner's Magazine," and is of peculiar interest as 
expressing the opinion of a writer who is no 
less shrewd in the management of his business 
affairs than accomplished as a man of letters. 
Mr. Howells (for he it is to whom we refer) 
has a weakness for the paradoxical, and it is 
not always safe to take him quite as seriously 
as he reads. But his recent discussion of the 
literary life in its business aspect is prefaced 
by certain opinions which, allowing for an evi- 
dently whimsical element in their statement, 
still seem to embody the doctrine that it is ig- 
noble to write for pay. Mr. Howells is, indeed, 
careful to say that, under existing conditions, 
a writer is bound to take pay for his work ; but 
he vaguely intimates that existing conditions 
are all wrong, that there is something essen- 
tially degrading in a writer's acceptance of com- 
pensation for his work, and that in an ideal 
state of society the man of letters would some- 
how be taken care of without sharing in the 
contentions of the market-place. 

We are inclined to think that Mr. Howells 
has not gone far enough in his analysis of the 
problem. The man of letters is, like other 
men, whether Jew or Gentile, " fed with the 
same food, hurt with the same weapons, sub- 
ject to the same diseases, healed by the same 
means, warmed and cooled by the same winter 
and summer." In a word, the man of letters 
lives, and must have the means of subsistence. 



212 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Shall he live by his pen, or shall he find other 
sources of revenue, and leave to his hours of 
leisure the cultivation of literature ? Many 
men of letters, doubtless, have done this ; much 
of the best literature has been produced under 
these conditions. The very best literature will 
get itself written under the most adverse form 
of these conditions. When, once in the cen- 
turies, a man has it in him to produce a " Don 
Quixote" or a "Divine Comedy," he will fol- 
low the star that lights his soul to the accom- 
plishment of its divine purpose. Mr. Howells 
thinks that Milton was overpaid for his " Par- 
adise Lost," and doubtless he was, in the sense 
that the bookseller's paltry stipend did nothing 
to strengthen the motive that impelled to the 
composition of the epic. But we must remem- 
ber that literature consists of more than the 
supreme masterpieces ; that the minor master- 
pieces are serviceable in their way ; and that 
the work of the honest journeyman is not with- 
out its uses. That the pursuit of literature 
should be relegated to the spare hours of men 
who earn their living otherwise, is a principle 
hardly to be defended, and Mr. Howells cer- 
tainly does not mean to have us take that view. 
The application of such a principle would spare 
us many worthless books, no doubt ; but it 
would also deprive us of much work, helpful 
in its generation, that we could ill do without. 
But if, on the other hand, literature is a le- 
gitimate profession, an occupation to which it 
is well that many men should devote their best 
energies and their entire lives, there seems to 
be no good reason why it should not fit into 
the general scheme of society and share in the 
advantages of its economic organization. That 
organization may at present work in a way 
very unsatisfactory to the ethical sense, but not 
even Mr. Howells will deny it to be better than 
the barbarism which it has superseded, and to 
represent a necessary stage in the evolution of 
the civilized life. Mr. Howells seems to think 
that the ideal society of the future will some- 
how take charge of the literary artist and care 
for him as for a public benefactor, that it will 
provide him with maintenance in the Prytau- 
eum. It is here, we think, that the analysis 
is defective. Under anything like the existing 
social organization, such public maintenance 
would merely shift the burden of the artist's 
support from his own special public to the pub- 
lic in general. He would still be paid for his 
work, having merely a new paymaster, prob- 
ably less intelligent than the old one. But un- 
der the socialistic organization that Mr. How- 



ells probably has in mind, we can see no reason 
why the artist should be singled out for special 
consideration. The honest ditch-digger is a 
public benefactor no less than the honest poet, 
and, if there be anything ignoble in the accept- 
ance of pay for honest work, it is equally de- 
grading to the manhood of both. All work, 
whether it be the digging of ditches or the writ- 
ing of epics, is service done by man to his fel- 
low men. There are but two things that need 
concern the worker : let him take heed that 
the work be worth doing, and that it be ser- 
viceably performed. The real degradation, 
whether in literature or in any other form of 
activity, lies either in the doing of work that 
is essentially worthless, or in the doing of any 
kind of work for other than its own sake. 

With the literary worker, the greater danger 
of degradation comes from the second of these 
causes. While we must admit the principle to 
be legitimate, the frank acceptance of litera- 
ture as a commercial product, to be bought 
and paid for at the market rates, does result 
in attracting to the literary profession a large 
number of workers who have no higher aim 
than that of turning the profession of writing 
to the greatest possible pecuniary account. 
But the moral to be drawn from this state of 
things is precisely the same as that to be drawn 
from any other occupation. Work for the 
mere purpose of gain is always ignoble, no 
matter what sort of work it may be. Upon 
this point, Mr. Ruskin has given us the whole 
ethical doctrine, has interpreted the law and 
the prophets, in his lecture on " Work." 

" It is physically impossible for a well-educated, in- 
tellectual, or brave man to make money the chief ob- 
ject of his thoughts; just as it is for him to make his 
dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people 
like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object 
of their lives. So all healthy-minded people like making 
money ought to like it, and to enjoy the sensation of 
winning it: but the main object of their life is not 
money; it is something better than money. A good 
soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting 
well. He is glad of his pay very properly so, and 
justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without 
it still, his main notion of life is to win battles, not 
to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. They 
like pew-rents, and baptismal fees, of course; but yet, 
if they are brave and well-educated, the pew-rent is not 
the sole object of their lives, and the baptismal fee is 
not the sole purpose of the baptism; the clergyman's 
object is essentially to baptize and preach, not to be 
paid for preaching. . . . And so with all other brave 
and rightly-trained men; their work is first, their fee 
second very important always, but still second. But 
in every nation, as I said, there are a vast class who are 
ill-educated, cowardly, and more or less stupid. And 
with these people, just as certainly the fee is first, and 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



213 



the work second, as with brave people the work is first, 
and the fee second." 

In a word, every man toiling with hand or 
head has the twofold ethical responsibility of 
choosing his work well and of doing it well. 
But in the special case of the literary toiler, 
the essence of doing well is to be sincere, truth- 
ful, and lofty of aim. If his work be done in 
this spirit, he need feel no shame in accepting, 
or even in stipulating for, its just reward, 
whether he be a journalist or a historian, a 
novelist or a poet. And if the time ever comes 
when all work is done in this spirit, we shall 
probably discover the existing social organiza- 
tion, based upon private contract and the ut- 
most individual freedom, to be the real Utopia 
of which impatient idealists have been dream- 
ing throughout the ages. 



BENJAMIN JO WETT. 

Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol College, Ox- 
ford, died on the first of this month, at the age of 
seventy-six. Born in 1817, he was educated, first 
at St. Paul's School, then at the College with which 
he has been ever since identified. He became a 
scholar of Balliol in 1835, a fellow in 1838, and a 
tutor in 1842. In 1855, Lord Palmerston appointed 
him Regius Professor of Greek. In 1882 he was 
elected Vice-Chancellor of the University. He was 
distinguished both as a theologian and as a Greek 
scholar. In the former capacity he wrote a com- 
mentary upon certain of the Epistles, and contrib- 
uted the paper " On the Interpretation of Scrip- 
ture " to the famous volume of " Essays and Re- 
views." It is as a theologian that he figures in Mr. 
Mallock's clever satire, " The New Republic," thinly 
disguised under the name of Jenkinson. As a 
Greek scholar he was one of the foremost of the 
century. His translations of Thucydides, of the 
"Politics" of Aristotle, and of Plato, are the best 
English versions of those authors that we possess, 
and may fairly be regarded as English classics, by 
reason of their beautiful and idiomatic style. Of 
his magnum opus, the translation of Plato, Profes- 
sor Shorey wrote as follows upon the appearance 
of the third edition last year : 

" It is not given to every man to compose (in original or in 
translation) five volumes of English prose of unfailing pro- 
priety, lucidity, and charm, never deviating into vulgarity or 
rhetoric, but always preserving as by Hellenic instinct the just 
mean and the exquisite urbanity of the best literary society. 
If we except the British Bible, it is probably safe to say that 
no modern literature possesses any other translation of like 
extent and literary excellence." 

This quotation is taken from a review published by 
Professor Shorey in the " American Journal of 
Philology " probably the most competent review, 
with regard to both philology and philosophy, that 
Jowett's work has received. We make a further 



quotation upon the subject of Jowett's theory of 
translation : 

"All that he says in his preface about slavish conformity 
to the original being the petty ambition of a schoolboy sounds 
plausible enough, and might convince us, did not Munro's 
Lucretius exist to prove that the most scrupulous conformity 
to the original and a certain inevitableness in the rendering 
of each and every word are quite compatible with an English 
of the purest and noblest type. Ingenious, fluent, easy, are 
the epithets we apply to Professor Jowett's renderings ; we 
should never, I think, call them inevitable. He himself ad- 
mits that to reproduce the movement and feeling of the orig- 
inal is the translator's ideal. But every scholar must feel 
that he has sacrificed this to the fetich of an equable and con- 
ventionable English style." 

As for Jowett's own style, unfettered by the re- 
quirements of translation, no more beautiful exam- 
ple can be given than the passage in which he " re- 
luctantly severs his lifelong communion with the 
spirit of the greatest teacher who has ever appealed 
to the reason of man." To the following lovely 
end does he bring his account of the life and works 
of Plato : 

" And so, having brought into the world ' noble children,' 
he rests from the labors of authorship. More than two thou- 
sand two hundred years have passed away since he returned 
to the place of Apollo and the Muses. Yet the echo of his 
words continues to be heard among men, because of all phil- 
osophers he has the most melodious voice. He is the inspired 
prophet or teacher who can never die, the only one in whom 
the outward form adequately represents the fair soul within ; 
in whom the thoughts of all who went before him are re- 
flected and of all who come after him are partly anticipated. 
Other teachers of philosophy are dried up and withered 
after a few centuries they have become dust ; but he is fresh 
and blooming, and is always begetting new ideas in the minds 
of men. They are one-sided and abstract ; but he has many 
sides of wisdom. Nor is he always consistent with himself, 
because he is always moving onward, and knows that there 
are many more things in philosophy than can be expressed in 
words, and that truth is greater than consistency. He who 
approaches him in the most reverent spirit shall reap most of 
the fruit of his wisdom ; he who reads him by the light of 
ancient commentators will have the least understanding of 
him. 

" We may see him with the eye of the mind in the groves 
of the Academy, or on the banks of the Ilissus, or in the 
streets of Athens, alone or walking with Socrates, full of 
those thoughts which have since become the common posses- 
sion of mankind. Or we may compare him to a statue hid 
away in some temple of Zeus or Apollo, no longer existing on 
earth, a statue which has a look as of the God himself. Or 
we may once more imagine him following into another state 
of being the great company of heaven which he beheld of old 
in a vision. So, ' partly trifling, but with a certain degree of 
seriousness,' we linger around the memory of a world which 
has passed away." 

This brief memorial of Jowett would be incomplete 
without a word concerning the man himself. One 
of the most lovable of mortals, his personal in- 
fluence was probably as important as that exerted 
by his writings. For many years past the Oxford 
colleges have known no more commanding presence 
than his, and upon his associates of the last fifty 
years he has impressed himself as few great men 
have ever had the privilege of doing. In the En- 
glish reviews of the coming weeks we may look for 
many personal tributes to his memory, and from 
them the world at large will come to learn something 
of the man whom it has long revered as a scholar.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



MR. GOSSE'S PUZZLE OVER POE. 

Not long since, the readers of a New York liter- 
ary journal were asked by its editors to name the 
best ten American books. The list as finally made 
out, or selected, by six hundred and thirty-two read- 
ers, was as follows, with the number of votes given 
each book : Emerson's Essays, 512 ; Hawthorne's 
" Scarlet Letter," 493 ; Longfellow's Poems, 444 ; 
Mrs. Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin," 434; Dr. 
Holmes's Autocrat," 388 ; Irving's Sketch- 
Book," 307 ; Lowell's Poems, 269 ; Whittier's Po- 
ems ; 256 ; Wallace's " Ben Hur," 250 ; Motley's 
Rise of the Dutch Republic," 246. 

It will be seen that this list does not include the 
name of Poe. Mr. Edmund W. Gosse, the British 
poet and critic, thinks the omission " extraordinary 
and sinister," and says that if he were an American 
he would be inclined to call it disastrous. It makes 
him wonder what is the standard of American style. 
Poe he regards as our most perfect, most original, 
most exquisite poet ; while some of the writers in- 
cluded in the list he had apparently never heard of. 

The omission of Poe's name was certainly signif- 
icant and does undoubtedly indicate that the taste 
of our people demands in an author or a poet some- 
thing more than mere literary genius ; and it is 
probably true that the world of readers generally 
cares less and less for poets of the Poe, the Swin- 
burne, the Rossetti type. Emerson did not admit 
Poe in his " Parnassus," though he admitted other 
American poets much less famous. Emerson's taste 
in this respect was fairly representative of that of 
his countrymen. Poe's literary genius, as such, was 
undoubtedly of a high order, higher in some respects 
than that of Whittier or Longfellow or Lowell ; but 
he was much less than these men in other important 
respects. He had less heart, less soul, less sympathy, 
T- in fact, was far less as a man, a human being. 
His work is interesting to poets and critics because 
of its technical perfection and originality. It is not 
imitative, it shows great mastery in fields where mas- 
ters are rare. But back of his literary and artistic 
talent what is there ? Not a large, brotherly, helpful 
man surely. Hardly any normal, healthful human 
throb ; hardly one valuable idea. Indeed, there is 
not one crumb of the bread of life in Poe, not one line 
that a man, as such, need read. His poems are liter- 
ary feats two of them quite extraordinary feats, it 
is true. I mean " The Bells " and The Raven." 
This, it seems to me, is the best that can be said of 
them ; while his famous " Annabel Lee " is to many 
readers like sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. 

Poe, like Swinburne, was a verbal poet merely ; 
empty of thought, empty of sympathy, empty of 
love for any real thing : a graceful and nimble 
skater up and down over the deeps and shallows 
of life, deep or shallow, it was all the same to him. 
Not one real thing did he make more dear to us 
by his matchless rhyme ; not one throb of the uni- 
versal heart, not one flash of the universal mind, 



did he seize and put in endearing form for his fel- 
low men. Our band of New England poets have 
helped enrich and ennoble human life ; the world 
is fairer, life is sweeter, because they lived and sang ; 
character, heroism, truth, courage, devotion, count 
for more since Emerson and Longfellow and Whit- 
tier and Lowell were inspired by these themes. I 
am not complaining that Poe was not didactic : di- 
dacticism is death to poetry. I am complaining 
that he was not human and manly, and that he did 
not touch life in any helpful and liberating way. 
His poems do not lay hold of real things. I do not 
find the world a more enjoyable or beautiful place 
because he lived in it. I find myself turning to 
his poems, not for mental or spiritual food, as I do 
to Wordsworth or Emerson or Whitman, or for 
chivalrous human sentiments as in Tennyson, but 
to catch a glimpse of the weird, the fantastic, and, 
as it were, of the night-side or dream-side of things. 

" You are not wrong who deem 
That my days have been a dream." 

But the man whose days are a dream, no matter 
with what skill he portrays his dream, will never 
take deep hold upon men's hearts. Think of the 
difference, for instance, between Burns and Poe. 
We are drawn to Burns the man; he touches our 
most tender and human side ; his art does not oc- 
cupy our attention. With Poe it is quite the re- 
verse : we care nothing for the man, nothing for the 
matter of his poems ; his art alone seems important, 
and elicits our admiration. 

The full-blown professional literary critic, like 
Mr. Gosse, disassociates literature from all human 
or religious or scientific or personal values what- 
ever. Its purely art value its value as addressed 
to our sense of form, of proportion, of music, of 
color, etc., alone counts. But with the mass of 
readers, as I have said, this view counts less and less. 
With the coming in of science, of democracy, of the 
industrial age, there has come in a new spirit, which 
demands of the book or the poem, What is it for? 
what message has it for struggling, thinking men ? 
which mood and temper begot it? in short, what 
ethical and human value has it ? This spirit is not 
insensible to the manner of the work, but it finds 
the final value in the matter, and especially in the 
man out of which the matter grew. Arnold's say- 
ing that all good poetry is indirectly a criticism of 
life, is a wise one. But more than two centuries 
before him, Sir Thomas Elyot said that poetry was 
the first philosophy, and that its chief office was to 
teach men " how to live well." A French critic 
and essayist was recently quoted in this journal as 
saying that in France there is a growing belief that 
letters " are not merely a relaxation, an amusement, 
or a consolation, but that they ought to result in 
some direct teaching and help to man, tracing for 
him a line of Conduct in life." In other words, in 
estimating a writer's work, verse as well as prose, 
its moral and human value is to be taken into ac- 
count its value as thought, and its value as a stim-

ulus to high thinking and noble living. Art for 
art's sake, in our age and country, sounds hollow 
and mocking. Art for life's sake and for the soul's 
sake, is the cry of the coming literature. 

I would not undervalue Poe. He was a unique 
genius. But I would account for his failure to deeply 
impress his own countrymen, outside the professional 
literary guild. His fund of love and sympathy 
was small. He was not broadly related to his fel- 
lows, as were Longfellow and Whittier and Whitman. 
His literary equipment was remarkable ; his human 
equipment was not remarkable : hence his failure 
to reach the general fame of the New England poets. 

JOHN BURROUGHS. 



MR. IRVING' S SHYLOCK. 



In none of Shakespeare's plays, probably, have 
opinions concerning the fundamental idea of the 
play and the nature of its leading character differed 
more widely than in the case of " The Merchant of 
Venice." Most of the German critics have consid- 
ered the centre of gravity of the play to lie in Por- 
tia's address to Mercy ; Gervinus maintains that 
the poet wished to delineate man's relation to pro- 
perty ; still more astonishing is the theory of Hebler 
that the central thought is the struggle against ap- 
pearances, and that Bassanio's speech when select- 
ing the casket contains the key to the poem. 

The actors have differed quite as much as the 
critics in their interpretations of this play. When 
" The Merchant of Venice " was first brought to 
light again after the closing of the theatres by the Pu- 
ritans, it had suffered such mutilation, changes, and 
additions, as to be scarcely recognizable. One among 
many adaptations was a musical masque by Lord 
Lansdowne entitled " Peleus and Thetis," intro- 
ducing a banqueting scene in which Shylock, seated 
at a separate table, gave a toast to the god Money. 
Strangely enough, this conception of the character, 
designed specially to provoke the mirth of the au- 
dience, held the boards for about a quarter of a 
century. Not until nearly the middle of the eigh- 
teenth century was- popular taste sufficiently edu- 
cated to give up its clown and welcome a revival 
of a true Shylock uttering the great poet's own 
words. It was Charles Macklin's performance that 
again presented " the very Jew that Shakespeare 
drew," and the date was the fifteenth of February, 
1741, a date truly memorable in the annals of 
the English stage. After Macklin, no other great 
Shylock appeared until Edmund Kean, who per- 
sisted in making his debut on the London stage in 
this character. Until that night, Edmund Kean 
had been a poor, obscure, insignificant actor ; but 
by his intuition and insistence " Shylock or noth- 
ing," he had said, he not only saved his manager 
from impending financial ruin, but, by a perform- 
ance more electrifying and magnetic than Mack- 
lin's, permanently established his own fame. 



Since then many great actors have rivalled each 
other in their interpretation of this wonderful char- 
acter, our own generation having produced three 
very pronounced types. In Edwin Booth we saw a 
sordid and shabby old Jew, wearing but one sign of 
wealth and power, a great ruby which glowed upon 
his clutching finger. Moved more by avarice than 
by revenge, the revengefulness arose from reasons 
personal rather than racial. Shylock's greed to 
''feed FAT the ancient grudge" his bitterness in sum- 
marizing his personal slights from Antonio, together 
with his exultation over the fact that Antonio had 
now come to him for help, were, in Mr. Booth's 
presentation, the most forceful lines, the rest of the 
play seeming to develop from these through the 
agency of the events that precipitated the Jew to- 
ward his defeated revenge. 

Very different was the Shylock of Lawrence 
Barrett. He avoided all shabby meanness, whether 
of speech, or dress, or conduct. Tall, robed in a 
black Jewish gaberdine bordered with red and 
marked with a red cross on the elbow, moving 
slowly and with dignity, Shylock's eager and crafty 
nature was betrayed chiefly by the manner in which 
his hands, richly- jewelled, clutched and twined up- 
on his long knotted staff. A Shylock intense in feel- 
ing, but restrained by habits of custom and remem- 
brance of many hurts helplessly received, a pent- 
up nature which allowed itself only guarded chances 
to justify itself for its "lodged hate and certain 
loathing," a sufferer who retained the dignity of old 
age in his outward appearance, along with the 
dignity of a rooted purpose too wise to unfold itself 
abruptly even in the great trial scene, these were 
the main characteristics of Mr. Barrett's rendering. 

Mr. Irving's performances of the past two weeks 
in Chicago furnish occasion to inquire concerning 
his contribution to the history of the stage-presenta- 
tions of Shylock. It is said that he follows, in a 
measure, the interpretation of Edmund Kean ; but 
we suspect that the character as rendered by Mr. 
Irving is a much more complex one than would 
have been conceived by a man of Kean's genera- 
tion, or appreciated by Kean's audiences. Is it 
saying too much for ourselves that, before the pres- 
ent day, men were oblivious of the mixed influences 
of heredity and environment which go to the mak- 
ing of Irving's Shylock ? Is it even going too far 
to urge that only a community recently stirred as 
this has been by a Parliament of Religions would 
be so ready to respond in sympathy with the repre- 
sentative and scapegoat of a persecuted race ? 
Whatever the cause, certain it is that never before, 
either by the stage or the printed page, has one 
been so impressed with a sense of the shameful way 
in which Shylock is baited and badgered, so filled 
with sympathy at the end of the Trial for the broken 
and ruined man who, for all his narrowness and sor- 
didness and vindictiveness, is yet so clearly the vic- 
tim of race prejudice and so-called religious zeal. 

Whether Shakespeare intended to excite these 
emotions in the spectator is a question quite apart ; 



216 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



it is not less but more honor to Shakespeare that 
the nineteenth century man can read between his 
lines some things that he himself may not have felt 
in the writing. 

Mr. Irving's Shylock is a character whose ruling 
motive in life is to avenge the wrongs of his race, 
wrongs which were committed long before the open- 
ing of the play, long before he himself was born. 
Chance throws Antonio into his power ; and Anto- 
nio, as the representative of the age-long persecu- 
tion, shall pay the penalty. As it is the art of the 
great dramatist to introduce all his leading charac- 
ters very early in his play, to foreshadow his plot 
very early in the story, so it is the art of the great 
actor to convey very soon and unmistakably the 
impression of the character he intends. We get 
our clue to Mr. Irving's Shylock at his first appear- 
ance on the stage, where every accent and modula- 
tion and pause are made to give force to that won- 
derful summary of his wrongs, ending, 
" What should I say to you ? Should I not say 
' Hath a DOG money ? Is it possible 
A CUB can lend three thousand ducats ? ' Or 
Shall I bend low, and in a bondman's key, 
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, 
Say this : 

' Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last ; 
You spurn' d me such a day ; another time 
You call'd me dog ; and for these COURTESIES 
I'll lend you thus much moneys ? ' " 

Again, the actor's art is quite as apparent by the 
passages he subordinates as by those he emphasizes. 
In the beginning of the third act, Shylock passes 
through many various emotions : his daughter has 
flown, taking with her his ducats and his jewels, 
he would that she were dead at his foot, so that the 
jewels were in her ear ; Antonio has lost an argosy 
at sea ; Jessica has parted with his wife's ring in 
barter for a monkey. The old actors made much 
of the conflicting emotions here, especially of Shy- 
lock's joy when he suddenly learns of Antonio's 
losses. Edwin Booth in playing this scene stood at 
the back of the stage when he heard these tidings. 
Flinging his arms over his head, he came stagger- 
ing down in mighty strides to the footlights ; sob- 
bing in a delirium of revengeful joy, and throwing 
himself into Tubal's arms, he cried aloud, " I thank 
God ! I thank God ! Is it true ? is it true ? " 

When Irving hears the same news he is stand- 
ing by the side of his friend. There is an inartic- 
ulate moan ; a moment's hesitation, as if doubting 
the truth of the report; an eager, tremulous grasp- 
ing of both Tubal's hands ; but the actual words, 
" Is it true ? is it true ? " are scarcely heard. Booth 
expressed one overmastering passion ; Irving sug- 
gests the complex passions of the Hebrew's heart. 
When the scene is ended, it is not these words that 
ring in the memory so much as the tremendous 
logic by which he has justified himself for his in- 
tention to exact his bond. It is hard to fancy any 
higher reach of the dramatic art than the repressed 
but cumulative force of the questions, 

" Hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands, organs, di- 
mensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same 



food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same dis- 
eases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the 
same winter and summer, as a Christian is ? If you prick us, 
do we not bleed ? If you tickle us, do we not laugh ? if you 
poison us, do we not die ? and if you wrong us, shall we not 
revenge ? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble 
you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humil- 
ity ? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his 
sufferance be, by Christian example? Why, revenge." 

Certainly no one who has heard it will be likely 
soon to forget the tone and gesture with which Mr. 
Irving concludes, 

" The villany you teach me, I will execute; and it shall go 
hard but I will BETTEK THE INSTRUCTION." 

No monster this, but a fellow human being, 
goaded, stung, outraged, until patience has ceased 
to be admirable, and revenge seems almost a virtue. 
Mr. Irving's Shylock never raves, but it is at this 
point that his suppressed and consummate hate 
comes nearest to violent outbreak ; it is all the more 
effective because of his usual self-control ; after this, 
it is impossible to regard him merely as a disgust- 
ing miser, destitute of ordinary human feelings, but 
as a type of natural sufferings and antipathies 
produced by a bitter sense of long-continued wrong. 

No possible opportunity is lost to strengthen this 
conviction in the audience. An action, slight in 
itself, but tremendous in effect, is introduced into 
the trial scene. Bassanio stands before Shylock 
with hands extended, saying, 

" For thy three thousand ducats, here is six." 
Shylock approaches him. The short, sharp knife 
which he holds in his hand is raised ; three times a 
measured, ringing blow falls on the coins, before he 
answers, calmly but inflexibly : 

" If every ducat in six thousand ducats 
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, 
I would not draw them ; I would have my ftonrf." 

Yes, Shylock is cruel. Mr. Irving's interpreta- 
tion does not blind us to that fact ; but it does open 
our eyes to the wrongs that have been inflicted and 
continue to be inflicted in the name of the Christian 
religion ; it does set us to thinking anew concerning 
the manner in which the individual becomes largely 
the product of his environment ; it does lead us to 
ask ourselves what blame we shall dare attach to a 
man who, although sinning, has also been severely 
sinned againsfr ; it does force us to inquire whether 
the same old spirit still survives and whether it does 
not rather savor of hatred of the Jew than of love 
of the Nazarene. ANNA B. McMAHAN. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE EAST AND THE WEST, ONCE MORE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have just read your editorial on " The Literary 
West," in THE DIAL of October 1, with the more interest 
that I had shortly before read Mr. Hamlin Garland's 
article in the last " Forum " on the same subject. I am 
a good Westerner, but I confess to having less interest 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



217 



in this discussion than in a question which lies deeper, 
and is, I suspect, fundamental to it. That question con- 
cerns the relative importance of substance and form in 
literary production. Is our coming literature to be 
chiefly a medium of instruction, of moral impulse and 
inspiration, or of mere {esthetic or intellectual enjoy- 
ment ? Is it to be dominated most by the living in- 
stincts of those who write and those who read, or by 
the so-called art-spirit ? What is the true proportion 
between this art-spirit and a more didactic purpose ? 
In a word, how real and strong and vital are we willing 
our literature should become ? 

The West is more receptive and more practical than 
the East, while the East is more finished and cautious 
than the West. The literary consciousness of the West, 
as represented in a writer like Mr. Garland, is pro- 
foundly stirred by those new ideals which demand a 
larger thought and life-content in literature, which would 
make it the servant of humanity's most pressing needs, 
using it to stimulate thought, elevate social conditions 
and standards, sweeten and ennoble life all round. This 
is a sound and worthy ambition, which must sooner or 
later realize itself in all the schools; but it is as easy 
to fall into a dogmatic and partisan spirit in the asser- 
tion of higher claims and possibilities here as elsewhere. 
It seems to me that Mr. Garland's enthusiastic advo- 
cacy of the merits of one geographical section is colored 
by suspicion and hostility toward another. As a Wes- 
terner again, " methinks he doth protest too much." I 
would rather wait for our peculiar merits to reveal 
themselves to Eastern recognition and to the world's 
recognition than join in the ardent advance proclama- 
tion of voices that, despite their high and generous ring, 
betray a tone of self-interest. I sympathise with much 
of THE DIAL'S discontent over the kind of criticism the 
West often suffers from the East, but I am sometimes 
more discouraged by our friends' replies to these criti- 
cisms than by the critics themselves. Whatever wins 
here, it will not be the spirit of self-assertion. 

Mr. Garland belongs to that class of writers, of which 
Helen Gardiner is a still more marked example, who 
care more about life than about any theories of the art 
which seeks to express and represent life : a choice wisely 
made from both the moralist's and artist's point of view, 
entirely consonant with the best modern tendencies. 
Nevertheless, it is as true now as it ever was that liter- 
ature is an art, and can live only as it embodies itself 
in beautiful and imperishable forms. Exclusive atten- 
tion to form will not secure this imperishability except 
as literary relic and curio; but neither will mere atten- 
tion to motive and substance secure it, as some of our 
literary didacticians seem to think. The novel may 
well be made the mouthpiece of a great idea, unveiling 
some social wrong or abuse, stimulating men to clearer 
thinking and better living; but unless in serving this 
immediate and particular aim it observes a higher loy- 
alty to rules of wider scope relating to life on its uni- 
versal plane, unless it is as true to life as a whole as to 
the special phase it attempts to portray, the book must 
fail as literature, however it may deserve to live as po- 
lemics and moral argument. 

This new contention between the East and the West 
bears too many marks of a family quarrel that sad- 
dest of all family quarrels where the older and younger 
members are at strife. It is unseemly, and should 
end. It is, however, less a downright struggle for pre- 
cedence than a natural disagreement between age and 
experience on the one hand and youth and the spirit of 



adventure on the other. The East stands loyally by its 
acquired results; it likes the old patterns, and is too 
proae to be satisfied with things as they are. The West 
has no acquired results, wholly its own, let us be hon- 
est and admit this, any more than it has results 
wholly its own in its political laws or institutions ; but it 
has rapidly-acquiring results in all fields. THE DIAL is 
right in saying that there is no justifiable use of the 
terms " Eastern " and " Western " in this connection ex- 
cept as regards the subject-matter; but even this dis- 
tinction fails too often to establish a rule. The writings 
of Mrs. Catherwood and Octave Thanet of the West, 
and of Egbert Craddock of the South, have the same 
literary flavor as those of Mr. Aldrich and Miss Jewett. 
They belong equally to the Atlantic school, if there is 
such a school. It is this literary flavor, impossible to de- 
fine, but as sweet and pungent and lasting as the scent 
of sandal-wood, which we almost invariably miss in the 
writer who proudly avows he has only an ethical pur- 
pose to serve. It is time to drop the use of terms that 
are only confusing and irritating. Those standards of 
literary worth established in the name and fame of a 
few men of New England descent are American and 
national. Does anyone think of Emerson or Lowell as 
an " Easterner " ? Let us accept the inheritance here 
offered, proudly and gratefully, as we accept that other 
inheritance bestowed in teachings of Jefferson and the 
Adamses. 

I cannot but think our Eastern friends behave as well 
as we do in this matter; if they have betrayed some 
ignorance and prejudice in what they have said of us, 
they have also covered us with praise and unaffected 
admiration, especially during this World's Fair year; and 
this praise has been bestowed not only on the marvel- 
lous exhibit at Jackson Park, but on achievements of a 
different order connected with our remarkable series of 
Congresses. Words of highest eulogium have been 
spoken of the mental activity of Chicago and the Mid- 
dle West, accompanied with expression of envious ad- 
miration for the freedom and breadth that mark life 
everywhere in this newer region. 

Power, Opportunity, Freedom, these are the words of 
large and lasting import in which the general verdict 
at home and abroad clothes its loving prophecy of us. 
Shall we then complain because along with such meas- 
ure of faith and applause we are sometimes rebuked 
and laughed at for the sins of haste and self-sufficiency, 
the errors and misdemeanors of youth ? Do we not 
know we have been guilty of such sins and errors, that 
we are guilty of them still ? There is no better sign of 
maturity than the power to estimate aright our neigh- 
bor's virtues and our own faults. The West has not 
yet outgrown all self-delusion in this respect, but she 
will outgrow it, and then the period of self-glorification 
will have passed away. CELIA p ARKER WOOLLEY.

THE GEOGRAPHICAL IMPORTANCE OF 

TOMFOOLERY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Every self-respecting writer and scholar in the West 
owes THE DIAL hearty thanks for its defence of them 
against the literary tomfooleries and gaucheries which 
too often are supposed to represent " the Literary West." 
If those critics who live nearer the sunrise could be 
persuaded to leave out geography in their admiration 
of these crudities it would be a distinct gain for the

whole country. Literary tomfoolery ought not to be in- 
teresting simply because it comes from the interior. Yet 
it is made interesting for that very reason by the conde- 
scending Eastern critic, who persists in regarding it as 
delightfully characteristic of the West. I am not sure, 
however, that American literature will have no geo- 
graphical traits. Such traits are obvious enough in 
British letters; and American literature the best of it 
is sharply accentuated as American. We might re- 
taliate, if we were not magnanimous; worthless stuff is 
printed by uncultured aspirants east of the Alleghauies. 
What if we treated that as Eastern literature ? And 
yet I suppose we shall have to take our medicine in 
this grace of condescension; New England and New 
York took it in their turn, and England and Scotland 
in their turn. What chiefly is new in this matter is the 
geographical importance of literary tomfoolery, which 
is foisted on people who abhor it, and is made to repre- 
sent people who are ashamed of it. Their precise griev- 
ance is the potency of tomfoolery. The rest of it the 
gracious and unctuous condescension we can stand, 
until our best work commands a more respectful atti- 
tude. Our penance will be ended, probably, before 
A.D. 1925. D H w

A PARDONABLE FORGETTING. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

An American can learn what prepositions are used 
in British English after born, before the names of towns 
and cities, by examining the " Dictionary of National 
Biography," edited by Mr. Leslie Stephen and Mr. Sid- 
ney Lee. The biographical sketches in it are so numer- 
ous, and the writers of them are of such various occu- 
pations and antecedents, that, concerning this point, the 
Dictionary may be regarded as a very trustworthy re- 
flection of educated British usage. Before most towns 
and cities at is used in this dictionary after born, as, 
born at Worcester, at Penzance, at Sheffield, at Salis- 
bury; but in is used before London. 

"Browne, Sir Thomas (1605-1682), physician and author, 
was born in London. . . ." 

"Lytton, Edward Robert Bulwer, first Earl of Lytton 
(1831-1891), . . . was born in London. . . ." 

"Abbott, Charles Stuart Aubrey, third Lord Tenterden 
. . was born in London. . . ." 

" He [Sir William a' Beckett] was born in London. . . ." 

Before Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dublin, and 
some important foreign cities, at or in is used at, per- 
haps, oftener than in, but in very often. 

" De Lane, Solomon, . . . born at Edinburgh." "Dar- 
ling, James, . . . was born in Edinburgh." " Grant, Sir 

Francis, . . . born in Edinburgh." " Davidson, Alexan- 
der Dyce, D.D., . . . was born in Aberdeen." "Finlay, 

Kirkman (1773-1842), . . . was born in Glasgow." 

" Macalister, Arthur, . . . born in Glasgow." " Maccabe, 

William Bernard, . . . was born of Roman Catholic parents 

in Dublin." " McCabe, Edward [same page], . . . born 

at Dublin." " De Cort, Henry Francis, . . . was born at 

Antwerp." " Decker, Sir Matthew, . . . born in Amster- 
dam." 

I will add some other instances of the use of in after 
born, noted in the course of a half-hour's search in a 
small library. 

"Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin in the year 1667." 
(William Edward Hartpole Lecky, "The Leaders of Public 
Opinion in Ireland," New York, 1883, p. 1.) 

"... Swift was born in Dublin. . . ." (Thackeray, 



" The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century," Lon- 
don, 1869, p. 136.) 

"With the exception of Wordsworth and Shelley, all our 
principal poets were either born in London, or made it their 
home." (Frederic Harrison, "The Choice of Books," etc., 
London, 1886, "Historic London," p. 241.) 

"Henri Perreyve was born in Paris April, 1831." (Philip Gil- 
bert Hamerton, " Modern Frenchmen," London, 1887, p. 109.) 

" Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was born on January 22, 1729, 
in Kamenz, a small town in Upper Lusatia. . . ." (James 
Sime, " Lessing," Boston, 1877, p. 20.) 

" Born in London, Oct. 19, 1605." ( W. A. Greenhill, " Sir 
Thomas Browne's Religio Medici," etc., London, 1881, Chron- 
ological Table, p. xxv.) 

" Gozzoli, Benozzo . . . was born in Florence." ("En- 
cyclopaedia Britannica," Ninth Ed.) "Hall or Halle, Ed- 
ward, . . . was born in London." (Ib.) " Hamilton, Sir 

William, Bart., . . . was born in Glasgow." (Ib.) Ham- 
ilton, Sir William Rowan, was born in Dublin." (Ib.) 

" Decamps, Alexander Gabriel, . . . was born in Paris." (Ib.) 

" The life of Edmund Spenser has few incidents and little 
certainty. He tells us he was born in London, near the Tower 
. . ." (G. W. Kitchin, Introduction to "Book I. of The 
Faery Queene," Oxford, 1881, p. v.). 

For the purpose of showing that a word or its employ- 
ment is not peculiarly American, the quotations cited 
above are as good evidence as if they were taken from 
the writings of Cardinal Newman or Matthew Arnold. 

But Dr. Fitzedward Hall, in a letter published in 
" The Academy," March 25, 1893, under the headline 
" The American Dialect," cites, as one among numerous 
examples of " indefensible " Americanisms, this sentence : 
" Benjamin Franklin . . . was born in Boston." Dr. 
Hall brings forward this and many other quotations from 
an American schoolbook for the purpose of illustrating 
"locutions which go far to realize finished debasement." 
However, we have seen that British usage requires the 
employment of in after born before London, and per- 
mits its use before the names of other large cities, at 
least before the names of other large cities not in En- 
gland. The only thing questionable, then, in "born in 
Boston " is whether in is properly used before Boston 
little as well as Boston big, whether, in other words, 
a writer should distinguish by the preposition chosen 
the rather insignificant Boston that was Franklin's birth- 
place from the populous Boston of later years. What 
perplexities would beset writers of biography who tried 
to make such a distinction general, may be imagined. 
Fancy the application of a similar test of correctness to 
the at's and in's of authors writing about the Middle 
Ages. But without pressing this further, surely we 
may say that it is pardonable in Americans to forget 
for a moment the taper beginning of a city that has 
long held so large a place in their minds. 

Since an early day American usage has been unset- 
tled as to the preposition employed after born. 

"... he [Franklin] was born at B'oston ..." (William 
Smith, D.D., "Eulogium delivered March 1, 1791, in Phila- 
delphia, before both Houses of Congress, and the American 
Philosophical Society," London, 1792.) 

Does this at reflect Philadelphian jealousy ? 
"I was born in Boston, in New England." (Benjamin 
Franklin, " Memoirs," etc. [3 vols., London, 1818], vol. i., p. 5.) 

There is not space here for the examination of Dr. 
Hall's opinions concerning the growth of an American 
dialect. That the widely spread English speech will 
eventually separate into distinct dialects, British, Amer- 
ican, Australian, African, etc., I have no doubt.

OLD-TIME DAYS isr NEW ENGLAND.* 

In her " Customs and Fashions in Old New 
England," Alice Morse Earle has given us a 
readable and a very serviceable book. It is not- 
ably free from padding, the extracts and ex- 
amples are well chosen and well ordered, and 
the running commentary is pithy and shows on 
occasion much appreciation of the quaint hu- 
mors of Puritan life. A fair notion of the 
range and tenor of the volume may be formed 
from topical headings under which the text is 
divided. These are : " Child Life," " Court- 
ship and Marriage Customs," " Domestic Ser- 
vice," "Home Interiors," "Table Plenishings," 
" Larder Supplies," " Holidays," "Diversions," 
" Books and Book-Makers," " Doctors and 
Patients," " Artifices of Handsomeness," "Fu- 
neral and Burial Customs." The work through- 
out shows painstaking research and logical 
methods ; and while its chief end is perhaps en- 
tertainment, its copious extracts from original 
records will be found of practical value. 

Someone observed of Bacon and Des Cartes 
that it was their prime merit in philosophy to 
have begun at the beginning. Mrs. Earle has 
also begun at the beginning. Her took opens 
with a summary of the woes of the Puritan 
baby ; and when we add that it closes with a 
collection of Puritan epitaphs, it will be seen 
that the ground is gone over pretty thoroughly. 
Infancy in Old New England was not, on the 
author's showing, a halcyon period. "From 
the time," she says, " when the Puritan baby 
opened his eyes in bleak New England he had 
a Spartan struggle for life." The struggle 
seems to have begun with baptism, and this 
ceremony was regularly performed on the Sun- 
day following the child's birth. As Mrs. Earle 
feelingly observes : 

" When we consider the chill and gloom of those un- 
lieated, freezing churches, growing colder and damper 
with every wintry blast we wonder that grown per- 
sons even could bear the exposure. Still more do we 
marvel that tender babes ever lived through their cruel 
winter christenings, when it is recorded that the ice had 
to be broken in the christening-bowl. . . . One cruel 
parson believed in and practised infant immersion, 
fairly a Puritan torture, until his own child nearly lost 
its life thereby." 

The mortality among infants, we learn, was 
appallingly large. Of Judge Samuel Sewall's 
fourteen children but three survived him, a ma-

jority dying in infancy ; while of his friend 
Cotton Mather's fifteen children " but two sur- 
vived their father." While these facts are sig- 
nificant, we are scarcely prepared to admit, 
what our author darkly hints, that this early 
mortality was largely the result of premature 
baptism. It is not unlikely, however, that the 
dangerous coalition of cold water, cold church, 
and cold parson found an occasional victim. 

If the child survived baptism, it had other 
perils to face in the shape of various strange 
nostrums of the day, among which we note our 
old friend " Daffy's Elixir " favorably known 
to colonial Mrs. Gamps as an effectual stu- 
pefier. Second in fame to the " Elixir " was 
a choice compound known as " snail-water "; 
and we may add parenthetically (on the author- 
ity of Mrs. Earle) that snails formed the basis 
or main ingredient of many colonial remedies. 
Children were, of course, the chief victims ; and 
the number of snails that a well-regulated Puri- 
tan baby swallowed in the course of a year seems 
to have been something prodigious. Says Mrs. 
Earle : " I should fancy that snails must have 
been almost exterminated in the near vicinity 
of towns, so largely were they sought for and 
employed medicinally." We subjoin the form- 
ula most favored for this strange medicament : 

" The admirable and most famous Snail water. 
Take a peck of garden Shel Snails, wash them well in 
Small Beer, and put them in an oven till they have 
done making a Noise, then take them out and wipe 
them well from the green froth that is upon them, and 
bruise them shels and all in a Stone Mortar, then take 
a Quart of Earthworms, scowre them with salt, slit 
them, and wash well with water from their filth, and in 
a stone Mortar beat them in pieces, then lay in the bot- 
tom of your distilled pot Angelica two handfuls, and 
two handfuls of Celandine upon them, to which put two 
quarts of Rosemary flowers, Bearsfoot, Agrimony, red 
Dock roots, Bark of Barberries, Betony wood Sorrel of 
each two handfuls, Rue one handful ; then lay the Snails 
and Worms on the top of the hearbs and flowers, then 
pour on three Gallons of the Strongest Ale, and let it 
stand all night, in the morning put in three ounces of 
Cloves beaten, sixpennyworth of beaten Saffron, and on 
top of them six ounces of shaved Hartshorne, then set 
on the Limbeck, and close it with paste and so re- 
ceive the water by pintes, which will be nine in all, the 
first is the strongest, whereof take in the morning two 
spoonfuls in four spoonfuls of small Beer, the like in 
the Afternoon." 

Of course Puritan childhood was not, figur- 
atively speaking, all mid-winter baptism and 
snail-water. That it had its flowers and its sun- 
shine (both perhaps a little wintry), our au- 
thor's interesting chapter on " Child Life " at- 
tests. There were, too, children's books in 
those early days, most of them, it is true, of 
the severely " improving," not to say peniten-

tial, order. Modern children, familiar with the 
tales of Mr. Henty, Mrs. Burnett, Miss Bouvet, 
etc., would scarcely relish, say, John Cotton's 

" Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes in Either England: 
Drawn out of the Breasts of both Testaments for their 
Souls Nourishment. But may be of like Use to Any 
Children." 
Or the much extolled 

" A Token for Children. Being the exact account of 
the Conversion & Holy & Exemplary Lives of several 
Young Children by James Janeway." 

Or Cotton Mather's 

" Some examples of Children in whom the fear of 
God was remarkably Budding before they died; in sev- 
eral parts of New England." 

Less serious were the books in the list pub- 
lished in 1787 by Isaiah Thomas. Here we find 
such cheerful titles as " Tom Jones Abridged," 
"Peregrine Pickle Abridged," "The Sugar 
Plum," etc.; while another advertisement of the 
same date contains, among the books for misses, 
the very un-Puritanical titles "The Elopement," 
" The Passionate Lovers," " Original Love Let- 
ters," and " Six Dialogues of Young Misses Re- 
lating to Matrimony." 

In her amusing chapter on " Courtship and 
Marriage Customs," Mrs. Earle observes : 

" In the early days of the New England colonies no 
more embarrassing or hampering condition, no greater 
temporal ill, could befall any adult Puritan than to be 
unmarried. What could he do, how could he live, in 
that new land, without a wife ? " 

To the normal and general evils of celibacy 
Puritanism added special and local ones. A 
multiplicity of legal and social penalties and 
discouragements were levelled against bache- 
lorhood. The bachelor was a " suspect " before 
the law, a pariah, an intruder, a persona non 
grata in the social circle. Overlooking the 
facts that the bachelor habit, once contracted, 
is hard to shake off, and that in nine cases out 
of ten the bachelor himself is the last one to 
blame for his condition, the Puritan Solous 
proceeded against him with inquisitorial sever- 
ity. He was seldom permitted to live alone or 
to choose his own residence, but had to live 
wherever and with whomsoever the Court 
pleased. In Hartford he was regularly brought 
up and fined twenty shillings a week on princi- 
ple a most arbitrary proceeding. Everywhere 
he was under the spying and tattling super- 
vision of the constable, the watchman, and the 
ti thing-man, who diligently reported (and doubt- 
less perverted) his " scircumstances and con- 
uersation." In Eastham a law was passed that 
" Every unmarried man in the township shall kill six 
blackbirds or three crows while he remains singjle; as a 
penalty for not doing it, shall not be married until he 
obey this order." 



The logic of this ornithological enactment is 
not apparent. As bachelors who were proof 
against penalties might possibly yield to in- 
ducements, certain towns held out " incurridge- 
ment " to wedlock in the form of home-lots to- 
build upon. These were assignable upon mar- 
riage ; and the author records that " in Med- 
field there was a so-called Bachelors' Row, which 
had been thus assigned." 

" Old Maids " were, we regret to learn, also 
under the colonial ban, though they came off 
more lightly, perhaps owing to the fact that 
their sex is debarred from the matrimonial in- 
itiative. " The state of old-maidism," says the 
author, " was reached at a very early age in 
those early days ; Higginson wrote of an ' an- 
tient maid ' of twenty-five years." John Dun- 
ton, in his " Life and Errors," thus defends an 
ideal member of the maligned sisterhood : 

" It is true an old (or superanuated) Maid in Boston is 
thought such a curse, as nothing can exceed it (and looked 
on as a dismal spectacle) yet she by her good nature, 
gravity, and strict virtue convinces all (so much as the 
fleering Beaus) that it is not her necessity but her choice 
that keeps her a Virgin. She is now about thirty years 
(the age which they call a Thornback} yet she never 
disguises herself, and talks as little as she thinks, of 
Love. She never reads any Plays or Romances, goes 
to no Balls or Dancing-match (as they do who go to such 
Fairs) to meet with Chapmen. Her looks, her speech, 
her whole behavior are so very chaste, that but once 
(at Governor's Island, where we went to be merry at 
roasting a hog) going to kiss her, I thought she would 
have blushed to death. . . . But as the Damsel I have 
been describing would neither anticipate or contradict 
the will of her Parents, so do I assure you she is against 
Forcing her own, by marrying where she cannot love; 
and that is the reason she is still a Virgin." 

While strongly encouraging wedlock, Puri- 
tanism took due care, however, that it was not 
rashly contracted. In the sight of the law, in- 
considerate courting was only a shade better 
than no courting at all. Hard indeed was the 
lot of the swain who ventured on love-making 
without first obtaining the sanction of parents 
or guardians. " Fines, imprisonment, or the 
whipping-post awaited him, did he ' inveigle 
the affections of any maide or maide-servant * 
by making love to her without proper author- 
ity." Numberless examples, says Mrs. Earle, 
might be given to prove that this law was na 
dead letter. In 1647, in Stratforde, one Will 
Colefoxe was fined X5 for " laboring to invegle 
the affection of Write his daughter." In 1672 
Jonathan Coventry of Plymouth town was in- 
dicted for " making a motion of marriage " to 
Katherine Dudley without obtaining formal 
permission. 

" The Governor of Plymouth colony, Thomas Prence, 
did not hesitate to drag his daughter's love affairs be-

fore the public, in 1660, by prosecuting Arthur Hub- 
bard for ' disorderly and unrighteously endeavouring to 
gain the affections of Mistress Elizabeth Prence.' The 
unrighteous lover was fined 5. Seven years later, pa- 
tient Arthur, who would not ' refrain and desist,' was 
again fined the same amount; but love prevailed over 
law, and he triumphantly married his fair Elizabeth a 
few months later. The marriage of a daughter with an 
unwelcome swain was also often prohibited by will, 
' not to suffer her to be circumvented and cast away 
upon a swaggering gentleman.' " 

It is needless to say that Puritan maids 
sometimes sided with their unsanctioned lovers. 
The remarkable case of Sarah Tuttle is in 
point. 

" On May day in New Haven in 1660, she went to the 
house of a neighbor, Dame Murline, to get some thread. 
Some very loud jokes were exchanged between Sarah 
and her friends Maria and Susan Murline so loud, in 
fact, that Madame Murliiie testified in court that it 
' much distressed her and put her in a sore strait.' In 
the midst of all this doubtful fun Jacob Miirline en- 
tered, and seizing Sarah's gloves, demanded the cen- 
turies-old forfeit of a kiss. ' Whereupon,' writes the 
scandalized Puritan chronicler, ' they sat down together ; 
his arm being around her; and her arm upon his 
shoulder or about his neck ; and hee kissed her, and shee 
kissed him, or they kissed one another, continuing in 
this posture about half an hour, as Maria and Susan tes- 
tified.' Goodman Tuttle, who was a man of dignity and 
importance, angrily brought suit against Jacob for in- 
veigling his daughter's affections; 'but Sarah being 
asked in court if Jacob inveagled her, said No.' This 
of course prevented any rendering of judgment against 
the unauthorized kissing by Jacob, and he escaped the 
severe punishment of his offence. But the outraged 
and baffled court fined Sarah, and gave her a severe lec- 
ture, calling her with justice a ' Bould Virgin.' She at 
the end, demurely and piously answered that 'She 
hoped God would help her to carry it Better for time 
to come.' And doubtless she did carry it better; for at 
the end of two years, this bold virgin's fine for unruly 
behavior being still unpaid, half of it was remitted." 

From the interesting chapter on " Books and 
Book-Makers " our remaining space allows us 
a few skimmings. There was, says Mrs. Earle, 
no calling more reputable and profitable in 
early colonial days than the trade of book-sell- 
ing, which then included publishing. John 
Dunton, who landed in Boston in 1686, thus 
eulogizes the four book-sellers which that city 
then boasted: Mr. Phillips was "very just, 
very thriving, young, witty," and the "most 
Beautifull man in the town of Boston " withal ; 
Mr. Brunning (or Browning) was a " complete 
book-seller, generous and trustworthy " a man 
who would promote a good book whoever 
printed it ; Mr. Campbell was " very industri- 
ous, dresses All-a-mode [sic], and I am told 
a young lady of Great Fortune is fallen in love 
with him"; of Mr. Usher, the fourth book- 
dealer, Dunton asserts that "He makes the 



best figure in Boston. He is very rich, adven- 
tures much to sea, but has got his estate by 
Book selling." Usher, it is recorded, died 
worth 20,000 a large sum at that time. As 
nine-tenths of the authors were ministers, and 
the publishers were all deacons, the church had 
a sort of monopoly of the trade. Book-print- 
ing, too, was an honored calling. 

" The first machine for the craft and mystery of print- 
ing was set up at Cambridge in 1639, and for twenty- 
three years the president of Harvard College was re- 
sponsible for its performances. Then official licensers 
were appointed to control its productions, and not till a 
decade of years before the Declaration of Independence 
were legal restraints removed from the colonial press." 

The first printer in the colony, Steeven Day, 
was, Mrs. Earle thinks, " about as bad a printer 
as ever lived, as his work in the Bay Psalm- 
Book proves." Nor were Steeven's shortcom- 
ings solely of a professional nature. He spent 
a term in the county jail, and seems, on the 
whole, to have been a sore trial to the godly 
ministers, his business associates. The second 
colonial printer " had to sleep in a cask after he 
landed"; and the third printer, one Johnson, 
having left a wife in England, was prudently 
bound over by the Court not to " invegle " the 
affections of the daughter of printer number 
two. 

Dunton, who was a book-seller, took back to 
England but 400 ; and he gives the Boston 
Yankees a very bad name in commercial deal- 
ings: 

" There is no trading for a stranger with them but 
with a Grecian Faith which is not to part with your own 
ware without ready Money ; for they are generally very 
backward in their payments; great censors about other 
Mens manner but Extremely Careless about their own. 
When you are dealing with 'em you must look upon 'em 
as at cross purposes and read 'em like Hebrew back- 
ward; for they seldom speak & mean the same thing 
but like the Watermen Look one way and row another." 

Josselyn gave them no better name, saying : 

Their leading men are damnable rich, inexplicably 
covetous and proud; like Ethiopians, white in the teeth 
only; full of ludification and injurious dealing." 

In the early days of American book-making 
there were no native novels : 

" The first book deserving the appellation that was 
printed in New England was ' intituled ' ' The Power of 
Sympathy, or the Triumph of Nature A Novel founded 
on Truth and dedicated to the Young Ladies of Amer- 
ica.' It appeared in 1789. Four years later came ' The 
Helpless Orphan, or The Innocent Victim of Revenge,' 
and then ' The Coquette, or the History of Eliza Whar- 
ton.' 

Colonial " authoresses " were rare perhaps 
owing to the prevalence of sentiments thus ex- 
pressed by Governor Winthrop : 



222 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



" The Governor of Hartford upon Connecticut came 
to Boston, and brought his wife with him (a godly young 
woman and of special parts) who was fallen into a sad 
infirmity, the loss of her understanding and reason 
which had been growing upon her divers years by occa- 
sion of her giving herself wholly to reading and writing, 
and had written many books. Her husband being very 
loving and tender of her, was loath to grieve her; but 
he saw his error when it was too late. For if she had 
attended her household affairs, and such things as be- 
long to women, and not gone out of her way and call- 
ing to meddle in such things as are proper for men, 
whose minds are stronger, etc., she had kept her wits, 
and might have improved them usefully and honorably in 
the place God had set her." 

The relations between publishers and au- 
thors, and between publishers and the public, 
seem to have been " most friendly." There 
was much bandying of compliments as may 
be gathered from the following announcements : 

"A New Edition of the really beautiful & senti- 
mental Novel Armine and Elvira Is this day published 
price 9d sewed in blue paper. To the Ladies in partic- 
ular and others the lovers of Sentiment and Poetick 
Numbers this Novel is recommended, to them it will 
afford a delightful Repast. To others it is not an ob- 
ject." 

" For the pleasing entertainment of the Polite Part 
of Mankind I have printed the most beautiful Poems of 
Mr. Stephen Duck the famous Wiltshire Poet. It is a 
full Demonstration to me that the People of New En- 
gland have a fine Taste for good Sense and polite Learn- 
ing having already sold 1200 of these Poems." 

" 'Tis said with truth by a secret but ingenious New 
England minister that no town is so worthy the vendue 
of this pleasing book as these polite gentlemen and gen- 
tlewomen to whom it will be on Friday offered." 

A public must be hard-hearted indeed to with- 
stand such blandishments ! 

Authors (if not " authoresses ") were treated 
with respect nay, with encouragement. They 
were even urged to write as this advertise- 
ment, from the " New England Weekly Jour- 
nal " of March, 1728, attests : 

" There is now preparing for the Press, and may upon 
Suitable Encouragement be communicated to the Pub- 
lick, a Miscellany of Poems of Severall Hands and upon 
severall occasions some of which have already been Pub- 
lished and received the Approbation of the best Judges 
with many more very late performances of equal if not 
superior Beauty which have never yet seen the Light; 
if therefore any Ingenious Gentlemen are disposed to 
contribute towards the erecting of a Poetickal Monu- 
ment for the honour of This Country Either by their 
Generous Subscriptions or Composures, they are desired 
to convey them to Mr. Daniel Henchman or the Publisher 
of this Paper by whom they will be received with Can- 
dour and Thankfulness." 

Boston had a public library at a very early 
day. By 1673 bequests had been made to such 
an institution, and consignments for it had been 
received from London book-sellers. The Prince 
library, the first large American book collec- 



tion, was started by Thomas Prince in 1703, 
and deserved, says the author, " more gratitude 
and more care than it received at modern 
hands." But many towns had no public libra- 
ries, and there was, hence, much friendly inter- 
change of books among neighbors. That the col- 
onial book-borrower did not vary notably from 
the original type may be gathered from adver- 
tisements of the period. Here is a pleasantly 
naive one from the " Boston News Letter " of 
July 7, 1712 : 

" A certain Person having lent two Books viz; Rush- 
worths Collections & Fullers Holy War & forgotten 
unto whom; These are desiring the Borrower to be so 
kind as to return said Books unto Owner." 

In the " Connecticut Courant " we find this sar- 
castic notice : 

" The gentleman who took the second volume of Ba- 
cons Abridgement from Mr. David Balls bedroom on 
the 18th of November would do well to return it to the 
owner whose name he will find on the 15th Page. If 
he choose rather to keep it the owner wishes him to call 
and take the rest of the set." 

Another Connecticut borrower is mildly asked 
to " return the 3rd Vol. of Don Quixote & take 
the 4th instead if he chuse." Mrs. Earle finds 
that Connecticut folk were especially given " to 
this slipshod fashion of promiscuous and unli- 
censed book-borrowing." In some advertise- 
ments it is even darkly hinted that " specifica- 
tions of books long lent have been given " (pro- 
bably to the sheriff) ; while one ungallant soul 
fiercely advertised for " the she-person that bor- 
rowed Mr. Thomas Brown's Works from a gen- 
tleman she is well acquainted with." 

Mrs. Earle has brought together in compact 
and logical form a variety of facts hitherto scat- 
tered and more or less difficult of access. As 
a concise account of domestic manners in Old 
New England we know of no better book.

RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIANS AS SEEN 
THROUGH FRIENDLY EYES.* 



The eminent French scholar and economist, 
Mr. Leroy-Beaulieu, has travelled extensively 
in Russia, and has embodied the result of his 
studies and observations in three ponderous 
volumes, the first volume being devoted to "The 
Country and Its Inhabitants," the second to 
" Institutions," and the third to " Religion "

and church matters. Only the first volume has 
as yet appeared in English or American trans- 
lations, and no promise is given in regard to 
more ; but it is to be hoped that translator and 
publisher will find sufficient encouragement to 
induce them to give us in English the remain- 
ing two volumes. Zenaide A. Ragozin's work 
is not merely a literal translation. She ac- 
companies the text with a thread of annotations, 
that bring into stronger light the masterly pic- 
tures of Russian life historical, social, pop- 
ular, which Mr. Leroy-Beaulieu unfolds be- 
fore the reader in a series as varied as that life 
itself. In these notes the translator reveals 
herself as a most loyal Russian, sometimes call- 
ing the author to task when she thinks he has 
in any way misrepresented her native country ; 
but we are bound to say that in some instances 
her patriotism seems superior to her logic. An 
example or two will suffice. In the opening of 
Book II., on races and nationality, the author 
makes the following statement, which would 
seem to contain the pith of good sense : 

" Were Russia a lately discovered virgin land, devoid 
of population, or roamed over only by a few nomadic 
tribes, she would soon offer to the world the same spec- 
tacle as the United States or Australia. She would 
rank with those countries where civilization, having left 
behind her the old institutions which protected her in- 
fancy, opens out for herself, on a new soil, a wider and 
more independent career. Left entirely to European 
civilization, Russia would quickly have rivalled Amer- 
ica; for according to a remark made by Adam Smith 
as early as the eighteenth century nothing, once the 
foundations are solidly laid, can equal the rapidly in- 
creasing prosperity of a colony which, in a free land, is 
at liberty to construct an entirely new building. What 
makes Russia's inferiority is her elderly population, 
which, by shutting out immigration from the West, robs 
her of the advantages of the usual marvellous growth 
of colonies." 

To this the translator enters a vigorous protest 
in this manner : 

" Once for all we must protest against this off-hand 
acceptation of Russia's inferiority as a thing understood, 
not even needing proof or discussion. Once for all let 
it be understood at last, what is so plain as to ' put 
out one's eyes,' in the graphic French phrase, cela cr'eve 
les yeux, that Russia is inferior in the way that the 
youngest of a family, who is not yet out of college, is 
to his elderly brothers, who have had the time and op- 
portunity to make their mark in the world. And it is 
notorious how often the youngest is the most gifted; 
then, adding to his own attainments his elder's expe- 
rience, the future is his when he survives them, as, in 
the course of nature, he must. There is nowadays but 
one opinion on the superior intellectual endowments of 
the individual Russians; how then can their country be 
inferior ? " 

There scarcely seems occasion for the trans- 
lator to rise in arms against the author's claim. 



Mr. Leroy-Beaulieu has not disputed the nat- 
ural endowments of the individual Russian. 
This " youngest of the family " may be " the 
most gifted," and he might give sufficient proof 
of it if he could get away from established 
Russian institutions and construct an entirely 
new building in a land like America or Aus- 
tralia. The trouble is, he is now hampered by 
the old institutions which have protected the 
infancy of Russia. 

In the Varagians (Varangians) most people 
are willing to see Norsemen. Professor Thomp- 
son of Copenhagen has, we think, proved that 
the words Russia, Russians {Rous, Rossia, 
Rossiane) are corruptions of the Swedish roths- 
menn, that is, rowers, or seafarers. They were 
Norse vikings, who in northern Russia became 
the founders of the Russian empire in the ninth 
century. As the story goes, Rurik and his 
brothers were invited to Russia and settled at 
Novgorod in 862. That there was a successful 
Norse invasion there is no doubt. In recent 
times some ultra patriotic Russians, Ilovaishi, 
Eldlonoff, and Zabielin, have attacked the view 
of the Norse origin of the invaders, and see in 
them only Slavs. Mr. Leroy-Beaulieu gives 
the generally accepted Norse view ; but, as 
might be expected, the translator, who is Rus- 
sian in every fibre, grows enthusiastic, and pro- 
tests in a note of two and a half closely printed 
pages ; but the long discussion surely does 
more credit to her loyalty to her race than to 
her scholarship. 

The work here presented to the English- 
reading public is forbidden in Russia. We 
wonder at this, since we do not find in the 
whole volume a word unfriendly either to Rus- 
sia or to its government ; but autocracy does 
not allow either its acts or its principles to be 
discussed, and this is just what Leroy-Beau- 
lieu' s book does, and that with a freedom in- 
compatible with the autocratic system. The 
fact of ostracism is an advantage to the work ; 
it enables the author to express his friendliness 
toward Russia, its people, and its Tsar, without 
a doubt being cast upon his independence of 
spirit. The author is anxious to impress upon 
his readers the fact that we must not apply to 
Russia the same notions and the same rules as 
to Europe or America ; for, as he says, 

" To do this would be the height of ignorance and 
unfairness. Russia is neither Europe nor Asia; she is 
a world by herself, situated between Europe and Asia 
and in a way belonging to both. Furthermore, it is not 
a state of our time. If it does belong to Europe, it is 
to a Europe of another age, not to modern Europe. If 
one would really understand Russia, one should, to look

at her, recede some three or four centuries into the past. 
To imagine, on the faith of the almanacs, that Russia as 
she is and the Emperor Alexander III. belong to the 
end of the nineteenth century, is, in spite of all chrono- 
logical tables, a gross anachronism. The Tsar Alex- 
ander Alexandrovitch, crowned in the Kremlin of Mos- 
cow, is not so much the contemporary of Queen Vic- 
toria as of Queen Isabel of Castile. The uprightness 
of his intentions, the loftiness of his character, are be- 
yond all doubt, but neither he nor his people live in the 
same intellectual atmosphere with ourselves. He can 
with a good conscience sign ukdzes that our conscience 
condemns." 

In eight books, all of absorbing interest, the 
author discusses the nature, climate, and soil, 
the races and nationality, the national temper- 
ament and character, the history and elements 
of civilization, the social hierarchy, the town 
and urban classes, the nobility, the peasant, and 
the emancipation of the serfs, and the mir, the 
family and village communities of Russia and 
the Russians. Hitherto we have been limited 
mainly to the statistical articles to be found in 
cyclopedias and to magazine articles for our 
knowledge of this great nation. Leroy-Beau- 
lieu's work enables us to become as familiar 
with Russia as with any other foreign country. 
In this statement Mackenzie Wallace's splen- 
did volumes are not forgotten and the reader 
will find them a valuable complement to the 
present work. 

In connection with the discussion of the 
Slavic race the author puts and answers the 
question, Is the race deficient in genius ? As- 
suredly not, he says. 

" It is a noteworthy fact that it was Slavs who opened 
the way to the West in the two great monuments which 
inaugurated the modern idea in the Renaissance and 
the Reformation; in the disco very of the laws that rule 
the universe, and in the vindication of freedom for hu- 
man thought. The Pole Kopernik was the forerunner 
of Galileo, the Tchekh John Huss that of Luther. These 
are great titles to glory for the Slavs so great that 
they are contested by the Germans. In the wake of 
Kopernik and Huss, the two Slav peoples most closely 
connected with the West, through religion and vicin- 
ity, Poland and Bohemia, could read off a long roll 
of men distinguished in letters, sciences, politics, and 
war. And among the southern Slavs, a small republic 
like Ragusa could alone furnish an entire gallery of men 
gifted in all domains. Where remoteness from the 
West and foreign oppression made study impossible and 
prevented individual names from coming up, the gen- 
ius of the people has manifested itself in such minstrelsy 
as has nothing to envy in the finest poetry of the West. 
In that kind of popular personal poetry which is so 
greatly admired in the romanceros of Spain, the ballads 
of Scotland, or the songs (chansons) of France, the Slav, 
far from yielding the prize to the Latins or Teutons, 
possibly surpasses both. There is nothing more truly 
poetical than the piesme (lays) of Serbia and the dumy 
(' reveries ') of Little Russia; for by way of natural com- 
pensation, it is among the Slavs least initiated into Wes- 



tern culture, that popular poetry has blossomed out 
most freely." 

The author claims that Russia is not a con- 
glomerate patchwork of peoples, like Turkey 
or Austria. Russia resembles France in na- 
tional unity. He compares Russia to one of 
those antique mosaic pavements, the ground of 
which is made out of a single substance and a 
single color, the border alone showing different 
pieces and colors. In chapters two and three 
of the third book the author has produced pas- 
sages of rare beauty, a kind of beauty, indeed, 
that we do not look for from an historian and po- 
litical writer. In these chapters he describes the 
Russian character as formed by the struggle 
against the climate, and shows why Russia has 
not like Scandinavia been the cradle of liberty. 
Unable to slip his neck from under the yoke of 
nature, the Russian has borne that of man more 
patiently ; the one has bent and fashioned him 
for the other. In the third chapter of Book II. 
to our mind the most fascinating part of the 
whole volume the author shows how the con- 
traries of winter, spring, and summer have re- 
acted on the national temperament. He paints 
a northern summer in a masterly manner, and 
closes with this eloquent tribute to Peter the 
Great : 

" If one is astonished at finding in one people so many 
traits of character different or even opposite, one can, 
in the person of Peter the Great, behold them all united 
and centred in one man. This converging, in one indi- 
vidual, of so many qualities and defects, so many fea- 
tures scattered through a nation, has shaped a queer 
and well-nigh monstrous man, but at the same time one 
of the most mighty, most enterprising, the best endowed 
for life and action, whom the world has seen. No other 
nation can boast of owning a great man in whom it can 
embody all itself, who in his very vices stands out a 
colossal incarnation of its genius. Peter, the pupil and 
imitator of foreigners, Peter, who seemed to have set 
himself the task of violently breaking his people's na- 
ture and who has been regarded by the old-time Mos- 
covites as a sort of anti-Christ, Peter is the Russian, 
the Great Russian par excellence. Standing before his 
face one may say that sovereign and nation explain each 
other. A nation that resembles such a man is sure of 
a great future. If it is apparently wanting in some of 
those highest or most refined qualities on which man- 
kind prides itself, it owns those which give power and 
political greatness." 

The reader will find much of interest on the 
subject of nihilism and on the emancipation of 
the serfs, the latter subject being treated very 
comprehensively and with great clearness in 
Book VII. The work contains several good 
maps, and it is as a whole the most import- 
ant and valuable work on Russia hitherto pub- 
lished in English.

Miss REPPLIER'S "ESSAYS IN IDLENESS."* 

It was the late Mr. Travers, we believe, who 
was one day surprised at seeing a certain distin- 
guished contemporary standing on Wall Street 
with his hands in his own pockets. In some- 
what the same way is the unprepared reader of 
Miss Agnes Repplier's Essays not unf requently 
surprised in coming across a good thing that 
is not quoted from Montaigne, Sir Thomas 
Browne, or somebody else. At first sight Miss 
Repplier's own remarks hardly come to view, 
for the number of her unfamiliar (but gener- 
ally excellent) quotations. The literary his- 
torian of the future will have little difficulty 
in describing Miss Repplier's method of work. 
" Her study," he will say, " was a room sur- 
rounded by pigeonholes marked with such titles 
as ' Cats,' * War,' ' Words,' ' Leisure.' In this 
room she was accustomed to sit and read the 
choicest authors, pencil in hand, and on com- 
ing across anything about cats, or whatever 
else, she would copy it off and stick it in the 
appropriate pigeonhole. When any pigeon- 
hole was full she took out the quotations and 
wrote an article for the 'Atlantic Monthly,' 
using them all." Now such a mode of compo- 
sition has its difficulties. In the present case 
the quotations are generally good and the net 
result almost always entertaining. But a book 
abounding in quotations rarely impresses the 
reader with the originality it may really pos- 
sess. One is apt to fight shy of such books. 
It is true that this is an age of potted litera- 
ture, but even at the present day there are not 
a few for whom potted literature has very slight 
attractions. By the peculiar character of her 
work Miss Repplier runs the risk of losing the 
attention of many who would be interested in 
the good qualities that her writings undoubt- 
edly possess. 

For when we say that " Essays in Idleness " 
are Miss Repplier's usual combinations of quo- 
tation and comment, we have by no means said 
the last word on the matter. That fact being 
once accepted, one is free to find in the book a 
certain sort of work, exquisite of its kind, and 
of a kind that rightly pleases many cultivated 
people. It may be that Miss Repplier is con- 
sciously a follower of Mr. Oscar Wilde. Con- 
sciously or not, she is, as an artist, of a char- 
acter somewhat akin to that sketched by the 
ineffable Gilbert, as he passed in an irridescent 
mist of words from his chambertin and orta-

ans to the roses in Covent Garden. Other 
authors write about life and such things. Miss 
Elepplier writes about (and around) what others 
lave written. She treats of all subjects, while 
involved in a sort of cloud of what other peo- 
ple have said on the matter. One gets from 
tier book no echo of the world, only echoes 
from the world of letters. On the foundations 
of what she has read she uplifts new structures 
of her own, and the remarkable thing is that 
these new structures are not wanting in grace 
and beauty. A somewhat individual gift this : 
it is worth while to remark it and appreciate it. 
It will not do to set Miss Repplier down as 
merely a clever woman who has read much. 
Her cleverness is of a peculiar type, and her 
work has its own excellences. 

In the present volume, the first essay is the 
most charming. It is about Miss Repplier's 
cat. Cats and men of letters seem to be the 
two things that stimulate Miss Repplier's gen- 
ius. For this essay (besides providing us with 
the opinions concerning cats, and other things, 
of Saint Beuve, M. Fee, Montaigne, Buffon, 
La Fontaine, Schopenhauer, Walt Whitman, 
Sidney Smith, Chateaubriand, Wolsey, Abbe 
Galiani, Voltaire, Champfleury, Monk Lewis, 
Heine, Pierre Loti, Theophile Gautier, Sir 
Thomas Browne, and Mrs. Graham Thomson) 
contains some of the most truly sympathetic, 
and therefore the wisest, remarks about cats 
that we have seen. It is worth while giving a 
few examples of them, although it is not easy 
to give the true quality of such a book by a 
few extracts. The real character is in the gen- 
eral toning rather than in any separate remark. 
" Rude and masterful souls resent this fine self-suffi- 
ciency in a domestic animal, and require that it should 
have no will but theirs, no pleasure that does not ema- 
nate from them. They are forever prating of the love 
and fidelity of the dog, of the beast that obeys their slight- 
est word, crouches contentedly for hours at their feet, is 
exuberately grateful for the smallest attention, and so 
affectionate that its demonstrations require to be curbed 
rather than encouraged. All this homage is pleasing to 
their vanity; yet there are people, less magisterial per- 
haps, or less exacting, who believe that true friendship, 
even with an animal, may be built upon mutual esteem 
and independance; that to demand gratitude is to be 
unworthy of it; and that obedience is not essential to 
agreeable and healthy intercourse. . . . ' My dog fetches 
my supper for me every night,' said a friend triumph- 
antly, not long ago. . . . < Would your cat do as much 
for you, I'd like to know?' Assuredly not! If I 
waited for Agrippina to fetch me shoes or slippers, I 
should have no other resource save to join as speedily, 
as possible one of the barefooted religious orders of 
Italy. But, after all, fetching slippers is not the whole 
duty of domestic pets. . . . Agrippina will never make 
herself serviceable. Yet nevertheless is she of inesti-

mable service. . . . Asleep or awake, in rest or in mo- 
tion, grave or gay, Agrippina is always beautiful; and 
it is better to be beautiful than to fetch and carry from 
the rising to the setting of the sun. . . . Schopenhauer 
has said that the reason domestic pets are so lovable 
and so helpful to us is because they enjoy, quietly and 
placidly, the present moment. . . . Life holds no fu- 
ture for them and consequently no care; if they are 
content, their contentment is absolute; and our jaded 
and wearied spirits find a natural relief in the sight of 
creatures whose little cups of happiness can so easily be 
filled to the brim. . . . Oh, you who strive to relieve 
your overwrought nerves, and cultivate power through 
repose, watch the exquisite languor of a drowsy cat, 
and despair of imitating such perfect and restful grace.'' 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



" David Balfour," Mr. Stevenson's new novel, is 
a sequel to " Kidnapped," but suffers less than do 
most sequels from comparison with their predeces- 
sors. The years that separate the two divisions of 
the romance have brought to the author a more 
compact and highly-wrought style, and do not seem 
to have impaired his powers of invention. Alan 
Breck appears from time to time in the course of 
the narrative, but David is the real hero, and the 
story at last finds a heroine in the altogether ador- 
able Catriona. Those who have missed the ewig- 
weibliche from Mr. Stevenson's books will have no 
cause for complaint this time, for " David Balfour " 
is a story of love as well as of adventure. The 
Scots vocabulary makes the book rather troublesome 
reading ; and one gets a little weary of the gram- 
matical mannerisms the progressive presents and 
future perfects of its speech. Mr. Stevenson's 
realism is a little too uncompromising in these re- 
spects. But the principal characters are certainly 
triumphs of delineation ; David and Catriona, James 
More and the Lord Advocate, are firmly and con- 
sistently drawn. A prefatory summary of " Kid- 
napped" breaks the reader's plunge, and spares

him the re-reading of the earlier romance although 
he might do worse than that. 

In writing " The Rebel Queen," Mr. Besant evi- 
dently had two objects in view : to exalt the He- 
brew, and to maintain the thesis that a wife should 
obey, as well as love and honor, her husband. The 
first of these objects he has sought to accomplish 
by an appeal to the historic sense and to the streak 
of mysticism found in most minds. Where George 
Eliot failed Mr. Besant could hardly hope to suc- 
ceed; and the Wandering Jew of his narrative, 
although a finely conceived and impressive figure, 
does not seem to be a typical embodiment of his 
race, and does not quite persuade us of the posses- 
sion, by that race in general, of an undue share in 
the moral and intellectual energies of mankind. 
The persistence of the type is the really striking fact 
about the Hebrew, and Mr. Besant brings that out 
very clearly. As for the author's success in his sec- 
ond aim, we will not venture upon an opinion. He 
will doubtless hear from his feminine readers in 
outspoken and unequivocal protest upon that sub- 
ject. The Cause of Woman finds many amazons 
in these latter days, and they will not miss so ex- 
cellent an opportunity for a skirmish. Mr. Besant's 
story is, taken simply as a story, varied in interest 
and extremely entertaining. But it has been too 
easily written to have any lasting value. 

"The Prince of India" has been heralded for 
some time by the newspapers, and the methods em- 
ployed have been not unlike those made familiar to 
newspaper readers by the enterprise of theatrical 
advance-agents. Descriptions of the plot, anecdotes 
of the writer, and curiosity-provoking extracts from 
the text, have all taken their turn, and had their 
share in preparing the newspaper-reading mind for 
the advent of the great work. We have even been 
told that President Garfield, in sending the author 
to Constantinople as American minister, had for 
his real object the provision of leisure and oppor- 
tunity for the preparation of a historical romance. 
That romance has now appeared, and its two thick 
volumes are at least a monument to the author's 
industry. The essence of the story may be briefly 
set forth. Our old friend, the Wandering Jew, who 
has done such veteran service to poets and novelists, 
is once more brought to light, and, in the character 
of a mediaeval Monte Cristo, is represented as seek- 
ing to organize a Parliament of Religions in fif- 
teenth century Constantinople. First seeking the 
support of the Greek emperor for his project, but 
failing to secure it, he has recourse to the Turk, and 
urges the young Mohammed on to the conquest of 
the capital. This plot is, of course, except for the 
actual historical episode of the conquest, too unreal 
to be very impressive ; at least, General Wallace is 
far from having the imaginative power necessary 
to make it impressive. The Wandering Jew comes 
to be very tiresome after a while, and the reader 
soon learns to skip his interminable harangues upon 
religious unity. His argument for a universal faith 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



227 



has a curiously nineteenth century fin de si&cle fla- 
vor ; it goes without saying that such an argument 
could by no possibility have been formulated by the 
Wandering Jew or anybody else, at the time of 
the narrative. But the Wandering Jew and his 
religious hobby are not, after all, the chief elements 
of interest in the work, and when we have set them 
aside there remains a historical romance of consid- 
erable interest and constructive skill. There is no 
doubt that the writer has made a careful study of 
the period, and actual observation has given vivid- 
ness to many of his descriptions. We do not sup- 
pose that his book will bear the minuter tests of 
historical scholarship, but neither will the romances 
of Scott, or of Kingsley, or of Lord Lytton. It 
doubtless comes as near to historical accuracy as 
" Ivanhoe," or " Hypatia," or " The Last of the 
Barons." The interest of the narrative is fairly 
sustained, and is worked up to a proper climax in 
the story of the siege of Constantinople. As for the 
style, it is well, it is what readers of " Ben-Hur" 
might have expected. The less closely it is exam- 
ined, the better satisfied will its readers be. We have 
no doubt that the book will prove popular, for the 
average reader cares nothing for style ; that it will 
ever rank as literature may be confidently denied. 

"Not Angels Quite " is the incomprehensible title 
of a molluscous narrative that is neither witty, wise, 
nor well-written, although it clearly aims to be all 
three. The story, as far as there is one, is that of 
Goethe's " Wahlverwandtschaften," but lowered to 
the level of comedy, and utterly devoid of human 
interest. But the writer can hardly have expected 
his lay figures to be taken as real characters ; they 
serve merely as a framework for his superstructure 
of dull realism, for his small-beer chronicle of the 
doings of a few eccentric Bostonians, given over to 
all manner of " fads." Anything more incoherent 
than this jumble of empty discussions, inapt quota- 
tions, and attempts at humor, is not often met with 
between the covers of a book. The style, with its 
self-consciousness and its affectations, is simply in- 
tolerable. 

One takes up " The Complaining Millions of 
Men " with the notion that he is embarking upon 
the dangerous sea of socialist tendenz-ftction. ; but 
he is quickly undeceived. The hero is, indeed, a 
sort of socialist, and is first introduced to us as a 
haranguer of labor gatherings ; but the socialism 
which he and his fellows represent is drawn in such 
caricature that it cannot be considered a serious 
study. This hero, who is a Hungarian of uncer- 
tain origin, and who is " taken up " as a sort of fad 
by Boston society, speedily developes into a brute 
of the most unmitigated sort, whose conduct is too 
repulsive to be even interesting for any consider- 
able length. Mr. Fuller has evidently set out to be 
a realist ; and unrelieved tedium is, for the most 
part, the reward of his readers. In one respect he 
has carried realism to an unjustifiable extent. A 
number of well-known persons, mostly writers, fig- 



ure in his pages, their actual names being very thinly 
disguised. The taste of this procedure is always 
questionable, and when it goes so far, in one of the 
present instances, as to insinuate a lack of personal 
cleanliness on the part of a certain character of 
whose identity no one will remain in doubt it be- 
comes simply intolerable. This is the worst offence 
chargeable to the writer, although others are not 
wanting. The story, which is told at great length, 
is essentially improbable, although to a certain ex- 
tent probably based upon an actual Boston scandal 
of a few years past. 

It is a far cry from " The Chevalier of Pensieri- 
Vani" to "The Cliff -Dwellers." Mr. Henry Ful- 
ler's new novel entertains us with no record of 
sentimental journeyings among the mountains and 
the monuments of the Old World, but gives us 
instead an alert and unsentimental depiction of 
everyday life in the newest great city of the New 
World. It is interesting to note how completely 
the writer has freed himself from a manner which, 
although at first charming in its graceful languor, 
was fast becoming a mannerism. The vein was 
near the point of exhaustion, and was wisely aban- 
doned when it had yielded its best ore. Mr. Ful- 
ler's "cliff-dwellers" are the people who live and 
move and have much of their being in one of the 
many-storied office buildings of Chicago. The 
metaphor of the title is original and pleasing, al- 
though possibly a little too elaborately worked out 
in the introductory pages. When we come to the 
substance of the story, it is found to consist in a 
series of very realistic episodes in the lives of half 
a dozen men of affairs, relieved by a few equally 
realistic domestic passages, and given continuity 
and coherence by their relation to the fortunes of 
one central figure, that of the unheroic young man 
who serves for a hero. The heroine of the story 
is not so easily singled out. Both of the successive 
wives of the hero have claims to that distinction, 
and so has Miss Cornelia McNabb, who comes 
from Pewaukee to Chicago bent upon conquests 
matrimonial and social ; but we are, on the whole, 
inclined to regard as the real heroine the pervasive 
but almost mythical Cecilia Ingles, who, without 
entering upon the scene, so constantly piques our 
curiosity, and of whose personal appearance we 
should have no notion had not the artist made up 
for the neglect of the narrator. Mr. Fuller's chief 
types the banker, the banker's son, the real estate 
speculator, the Western representative of an East- 
ern house, and the young man whose fortunes most 
engage the reader are absolutely truthful; the 
uncompromising actuality of their delineation will 
cause many a reader to wince, but he must at the 
same time confess to the accuracy of the portrait- 
ure. At first sight, Mr. Fuller's study, although 
minute, appears merely superficial, but a closer ex- 
amination shows that he has insight as well as the 
observant faculty. We come, for example, upon 
quiet incisive characterizations of Chicago that say

[Oct. 16, 



much in few words. "He seemed to see before 
him the spokesman of a community where pros- 
perity had drugged patriotism into unconsciousness. 
and where the bare scaffoldings of materialism felt 
themselves quite independent of the graces and 
draperies of culture." "To the Chicagoan, the 
name of the town, in its formal, ceremonial use, 
has a power that no other word in the language 
quite possesses. It is a shibboleth, as regards its 
pronunciation ; it is a trumpet-call, as regards its 
effect." We quote almost at random these two 
bits of criticism ; there are many others equally 
searching. Mr. Fuller appears to be one of the 
few people who can judge with objective fairness 
of the community in which their lives have been 
spent. His book seems to us to have no less value 
as a document than interest as a story. 

" The Tutor's Secret " is one of those sane and 
temperate works of fiction that come from time to 
time, in refutation of the popular prejudice that 
French novelists are all repulsive realists or morbid 
sensualists. M. Cherbuliez has taken a simple and 
familiar theme that of the family tutor in love 
with the young woman whom he is charged to in- 
struct ; but his treatment is so fresh, so brilliant, 
and so sympathetic, that he makes of his theme a 
new story. The outcome of the situation is neither 
violence nor despair one of which would surely 
have been given us by a writer with leanings to- 
wards sensationalism, but a chastened and phil- 
osophical acceptance of the inevitable. The char- 
acters are drawn with perfect fidelity to life ; they 
speak and act in perfectly natural ways, and stand 
out in distinct relief. They are not types, but in- 
dividuals, and their human interest is very manifest. 
Situations which would be a trifle risqu6 in the 
hands of most writers receive a sober treatment de- 
void of the least offence, and the story, although 
nowhere obtrusively didactic, has very evident bear- 
ings upon the conduct of life. We notice one cu- 
rious inadvertence. Among the books read by the 
fair pupil-heroine, is one entitled " The Destiny of 
Man, Read by the Light of His Origin." It should 
be " viewed in," not " read by," but that is not the 
point. It is a little curious to find the author thus 
characterized : " He is a theologian, and the trail 
of the serpent is plain." Possibly Mr. Fiske is 
not altogether undeserving of this treatment, but it 
is likely to surprise him. 

The idiosyncrasy of the collector is one, although 
the mania may pursue many objects. In the story of 
" The Faience Violin " the object is pottery, prob- 
ably as potent to harden the heart as old books, or 
tulips, or postage stamps. This humorous study in 
moral pathology is the work of the late Jules Fleury 
(Champfleury), who had the knowledge of an ex- 
pert in keramics and the wit of a Frenchman of let- 
ters. It is a very charming bit of work, and Mr. 
Bishop, who has turned it into the most flexible 
and idiomatic of English, was well advised in offering 
it to the public of another than its original speech. 



One of the three stories in Mr. James's new 
volume " Lord Beaupre" " follows the lines of 
normal human activity ; the two others are whim- 
sical in the extreme, if not actually morbid. " The 
Visits," slighter than the others, is a tragic study 
of an unbalanced temperament, and is even more 
inconclusive than most of the author's stories. The 
charm of " The Private Life," although hope- 
lessly elusive, is not without a certain power of 
fascination. It must be taken, if at all seriously, 
as a sort of allegorical study of the problem of 
personality. One type of character represented 
in this story by Lord Mellif ont exists only for 
the. public, lives and moves and has its being in the 
appreciation or applause of its fellows. The au- 
thor whimsically suggests that such a character has 
no " private life " at all, that it is but a sort of 
plausible simulacrum, vanishing when the audience 
dissolves, reemerging from its limbo with the ap- 
pearance of some one (may we say some one else ?) 
upon the scene. Its very existence is not a reality, 
but a mere reaction. Contrasted with this type is 
the other embodied in Claude Vawdrey, with whom 
the "private life" is the real one, whose personal- 
ity as displayed to the world is only a faint projec- 
tion from the real inner self perhaps what the 
theosophists would call an astral body. The delin- 
eation of these two types is very ingenious, and the 
author contrives, by many subtle touches, to invest 
his fanciful thesis with something of verisimilitude. 
But the allegory lurks beneath, and his readers can 
never quite forget that. 

Mr. Hibbard's new volume of short stories em- 
phasizes that writer's claims to a high rank among 
those who practice the art of fiction in this special 
field. His work approaches the best French models 
in its appreciation of the limitations imposed by hia 
chosen form, in its sense of the episode, and in its 
constructive skill. " Nowadays," the titular story, 
is a minor masterpiece, marred only by a slight af- 
fectation in the use of its title as a catch-word. 
" There's Nothing Half so Sweet in Life " and " A 
Mad World, My Masters " are also admirable. 
These stories are based upon the " psychological mo- 
ment," selected with rare discrimination, and dwelt 
upon just long enough to keep interest at its height. 
*' Guilty Sir Guy " is a ghost-story of the Stockton- 
ian type, amusing but not impressive. The two 
remaining stories are a trifle less successful.

In a former issue of THE DIAL

praise a collection of letters of James 
Smetham and to give some account of their author. 
To the " Letters " is now added a companion vol- 
ume, "The Literary Works of James Smetham" 
(Macmillan), containing four essays and a number

of poems. Three of the essays are reprinted from 
the " London Quarterly Review," and the fourth, a 
pleasant paper on Gerhard Dow, is from the " Art 
Journal." We may say at once of these essays 
that, while they merit reprinting, they lack the en- 
gaging personal note and spontaneity of the letters, 
and their style is at times singularly involved. The 
paper on Sir Joshua Reynolds is a good speci- 
men of the biographical review, chatty, and full of 
illustrative, well-ordered facts. Reynolds's unhappy 
excursions into the " grand style " of painting are 
severely dealt with : " In the highest subjects of all, 
his failure was the most signal. Of the Oxford 
window, our only intuition is, that it is abominable 
in theory, in conception, in style. The lubberly 
angel above, the smirking faces below, the vapid 
rows of Virtues between the mullions, scarcely higher 
in invention than those blindfold white women with 
scales, idiotic Hopes with anchors, which support 
the dignity of a ' Perpetual Grand Master ' of the 
Order of Odd Fellows, on his engraved diploma, 
are all bad together." The essay on William 
Blake a genius with whom Smethan himself had 
much in common is a rather notable production, 
and was appended in part to Gilchrist and Ros- 
setti's Life of Blake. Touching the dispute as 
to Blake's sanity, the author is of opinion that he 
was, at least, " slightly touched." A curious semi- 
mechanical explanation is offered of Blake's boyish 
vision of " a tree filled with angels " his report of 
which at home, by the way, nearly earned him a 
thrashing at the hands of his prosaic and truth-lov- 
ing father. First picturing the lad as resting " among 
the orchai'ds " after a tramp over the Surrey hills, 
the author continues : " Here he pauses, leans over 
a gate, looks at a large blossom-loaded tree in which 
the threads of sunlight are entangled like gossamers, 
which ' twinkle into green and gold.' A zephyr 
stirs the cloud of sun-stricken bloom, where white 
commingled with sparkling red flushes over leaves 
of emerald. Tears of delight ' rise from his heart 
and gather to his eyes ' as he gazes on it. The rays 
which kindle the blossoms turn his gathered tears 
to prisms. . . . The impressible brain, already filled 
with thoughts of the ' might of stars and angels,' 
kindles suddenly into a dream-like creative energy, 
and the sunny orchard becomes a Mahanaim, even 
to his outward eye." In the paper on Gerhard 
Dow, Smetham shows that, despite his own ideal- 
ism, he could appreciate the home-keeping genius 
of the " rubbishing Dutchmen." 

The Arena Co. issue, in a neat vol- 
ume of 375 pages, a life of Albert 
Brisbane, the American Fourierist 
and reformer, by his wife, Redelia Brisbane. The 
body of the book was taken partly from Mr. Bris- 
bane's dictation and partly from his journal, and 
the author has added a "Character Study" which 
is chiefly remarkable as a pathetic instance of the 
futility of the personal estimate. The subject of 
the biography was a prominent figure about 1840

an era of social and religious ferment. He was the 
pioneer and chief exponent in this country of Four- 
ierism ; and to his efforts were largely due the 
thirty-four American Fourieristic experiments (as 
enumerated by Mr. Noyes), the most noteworthy 
of which was " Brook Farm." Horace Greeley 
was one of his converts ; and Ripley, Margaret 
Fuller, Channing, Hawthorne, and others, were 
probably more or less affected by his doctrines. 
Brisbane was a gifted speaker though perhaps a 
little in the style of the "tedious archangel" of 
Concord; indeed, Robert Owen once called him 
"America's first orator." He was a singularly pure, 
high-minded, and withal un-practical man ; and 
like so many of his type, he knew little of and cared 
little for the elements of the society he proposed to 
regenerate. As our author says, '' his very mental 
constitution rendered it impossible for him ever to 
attain to a commonplace, common-sense apprecia- 
tion of the matter-of-fact world " than which no- 
thing more need be said to assure the reader of the 
practical fruitlessness of Mr. Brisbane's well-meant 
apostolate. The volume has an element of interest 
for the general reader in its anecdotes and sketches 
of eminent people, including Goethe, Heine, Men- 
delssohn, V. Cousin, Hegel, Fourier, Arthur Young, 
Webster, Clay, Seward, Garrison, and others. Mr. 
Brisbane saw Goethe shortly before the poet's death : 
" His appearance was impressive. Though age had 
dimmed the eye and rendered the voice tremulous, 
the firm head was still well-poised, and the finely-cut 
features preserved traces of past beauty. Never- 
theless, it was evident that the equilibrium of the 
intellect had to be maintained with great care. I 
could see that the spirit trembled in its cerebral 
home, ready at any moment to take its flight. He 
spoke slowly, following with difficulty his trains of 
thought ; and the most that I retain of that inter- 
view was a remark that he made on the tendency 
of the human mind to accept those theories which 
are most congenial to the individual character." 
Heine, says Mr. Brisbane, "was a man of small 
stature, thin and wiry, but compactly built; a 
swarthy face, the blackest of black hair, and small 
black eyes which seemed animated with one pene- 
trating glow of sarcasm. There was an intensity 
in his regard which impressed one peculiarly, as if 
the eye alone, in which beamed a soul on fire, con- 
stituted the man. ... It would seem as if he were 
internally at work tearing to pieces every subject 
presented to him, and dissecting every idea that 
crossed his mind. ... I liked Heine very much. 
He seemed an earnest thinker at the bottom, be- 
neath all his sarcasm, and one endeavoring to ar- 
rive at the truth." There are two portraits in the 
volume.

Thackeray out of his narrative altogether for the 
great novelist certainly does flit through it in a 
spectral " Mrs. Harris " sort of fashion. The book, 
however, though amusing enough in itself, is scarcely 
what its title leads one to expect, a real addition to 
Thackerayana. It is essentially the (largely pic- 
torial) record of the American impressions of its 
author, who, in 1852, accompanied Thackeray as his 
amanuensis on his American lecturing tour. While 
the text is confessedly written up to the pictures, 
it is usually bright and pungent, and contains some 
amusing anecdotes. During a visit to the Harper's 
establishment, Thackeray took occasion to ask 
" Whose name stood foremost in popularity in book 
sales in the United States. He [Mr. James Har- 
per] took down a ponderous ledger, turned up the 
leaves at letter J, and said, ' George Payne Rains- 
ford James heads the list, far ahead of any other 
author, as you can judge for yourself by glancing 
at the number of his books sold. He turns out a 
novel every six months, and the success is always 
the same, and tremendous.' " Mr. Harper explained 
this astonishing vogue by saying, " The main reason 
is that his romances can always be safely placed 
upon the family table, with the certainty that no 
page will sully or call the blush to the cheek of any 
member of the household " a reply more flatter- 
ing, perhaps, to Mr. James's pages than to the men- 
tal tendencies of those for whom they were sup- 
posed to be such eminently "safe" reading. Mr. 
Coote records that this chaste romancer, then Brit- 
ish Consul at Norfolk, Va., was compelled, owing 
to his anti-slavery views, to exchange his post for 
Venice " the only place," he adds with some hu- 
mor, " where he could not descry two muffled cav- 
aliers ascending a hill on horseback." The numer- 
ous pen-sketches form interesting records of Amer- 
ican men, cities, and manners of forty years ago. 

Brilliant picture, " The C U1>t f , L U1 ' 8 XIV "" the 

of French people current volume of M. Samt-Amand's 
d Regime. sub _ series Women o f Versailles " 
(Scribner), should prove a popular one, dealing 
as it does with such striking personalities as Mon- 
tespan, de Maintenon, La Valliere, etc. Like its 
predecessors, the book is full of court glitter and 
romance. We have followed M. Saint-Amand's 
series of brilliant historical pictures with much in- 
terest, though not without regret that the current of 
his sympathies should be, as we think, so constantly 
misdirected. Inspired by his royalist leanings and 
his taste for the material pomp and stately tradi- 
tions of the Old Regime, he casts a glamour of ro- 
mance and a tinge of sentiment about a class that, 
at the period treated, existed solely by preying upon 
the life of the French nation. He is touched by the 
April sorrows and humors of the Sun King's titled 
Cyprians ; for the life-long misery of Jacques Bon- 
homme, who paid with tears and toil for the splen- 
dors of the shameful Versailles Olympus, he has 
scarcely a passing word. M. Saint-Amand has, of 
course, the right to choose his historical province 



and his point of view ; but it is well to qualify the 
impressions he gives us by turning, for instance, to 
La Bruyere's pictures of the wretched French peas- 
antry a class robbed alike by the Crown, the 
Church, and the Seigneurs, slaves of the soil at 
which they toiled with such indomitable patience,. 
beings who " seemed just capable of speech, and 
when they stood erect displayed the lineaments of 
men." 

Two new books of " The Distaff Se- 

Essays on the

Wiggin, and " Household Art," edited by Candace 
Wheeler. Of the eight essays, by as many differ- 
ent women, which compose the first-named book, 
all except two here make their first appearance in 
print, though all are written with evident knowl- 
edge of and enthusiasm for kindergarten work. The 
subject is treated rather in its lai'ger relations to 
life than in its methods and technicalities, the best 
being " The Relation of the Kindergarten to Social 
Reform " by the editor, and " Outgrowths of Kin- 
dergarten Training " by Mrs. A. B. Longstreet. 
The collection of essays on " Household Art "is an 
admirable one, though all have previously appeared 
in magazines except the concluding one by the edi- 
tor, read before the recent Art Congress of the Co- 
lumbian Exposition. Three of the essays contain 
valuable material for a history of American art as 
applied to the household, namely, " The Develop- 
ment of American Homes " by Mrs. Rensselaer, 
" Some Work of the < Associated Artists ' " by Mrs. 
Burton Harrison, and " The Progress of American 
Decorative Art " by Mary Gay Humphreys. 

When an old favorite appears in a 
new form, especially if attended 
"with additions," a certain amount 
of question and distrust arises. These newcomers 
can it be that they are quite as good as the old 
friends ? or is it not probable that what has been done 
once con amore will lose somewhat of its flavor when 
duplicated to order ? Such thoughts will be likely 
to occur to the lovers of Andrew Lang's " Letters 
to Dead Authors " on the announcement of a new 
edition by the Scribners, with four additional let- 
ters. But all doubts vanish with the reading. The 
new quartette letters to John Knox, Increase 
Mather, Homer, and Mr. Samuel Pepys are in 
every way worthy of the companionship in which 
they are placed. Indeed, perhaps there is nothing 
better, either old or new, in the volume than the 
letter to Homer. After all the learned treatises on 
the authorship of Homer, after all that has been 
written, pro and con, in regard to the man Homer 
and the poems which bear his name, it is no small 
glory to Mr. Lang that, in his own confidential and 
sympathetic though half playful way, he manages 
to offer one of the strongest and most eloquent of 
appeals for the single authorship of these poems, 
and impress the conviction that " there is a poet in 
the poems, as there is a God in the world."

$&' only fleeting value and interest. Es- 
England. pecially if the places described be 

those often visited and easily accessible, few writ- 
ers have the art of lending enduring qualities to 
their sketches. That Mr. Winter is one of these 
few, however, is sufficiently shown by the history 
of his little collection of twenty-two essays on the 
much-written-about subject of " Shakespeare's En- 
gland." The papers commemorate two visits to 
England, made so long ago as 1887 and 1882 ; al- 
though written for newspaper publication in the 
first instance, they have passed through one English 
and two or three American editions, the latest of 
which is an illustrated one (Macmillan). In his 
new preface, Mr. Winter congratulates himself with 
reason that his " endeavor to reflect the gentle sen- 
timent of English landscape and the romantic char- 
acter of English rural life has not proved altogether 
in vain." He may also congratulate himself that 
the handsome binding and presswork provided by 
the publishers of this edition, together with the 
seventy-nine illustrations skilfully chosen by his 
friend Mr. George P. Brett, will probably still fur- 
ther enhance his book in popular favor.

his attitude toward the Monroe doctrine ; England's 
course in the Alabama matter and in our Civil War 
generally. Nevertheless, the effort to develop such 
features as these has not seriously interfered with 
a just regard for proportion, nor is the work a par- 
tisan one in any sense. Six maps, five pages of 
bibliography for collateral reading, a list of gene- 
alogies and important dates, and a very large num- 
ber of illustrations, are commendable features of 
the book. __

a list of twenty-eight strictly English elegies, three 
translations from the Greek are included, namely, 
idylls from Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, these 
having so often served as models for modern ele- 
gies and pastorals that no book of this class could 
be considered complete without them. The selection 
varies from such long examples as Tennyson's " In 
Memoriam " to such brief verses as " The Sea-Dirge" 
from Shakespeare's "Tempest." The notes are good 
and generally without superfluity ; the introductions 
which preface the work of each writer, though brief, 
are valuable. The book will be useful both for the

rare to find a good matured horse in a dealer's stable," 
the writer says : " Whoever has one will take good care 
to keep it, or else he will get a higher price for it 
amongst his friends than from a dealer," in which ob- 
servation there is a world of truth. The book also con- 
tains excellent practical chapters on the training and 
care of horses. 

MR. THOMAS NELSON PAGE is a young writer to have 
attained the dignity of " collected works," but in this 
form he already appears (Scribner) to the extent of 
four uniform volumes three being fiction, and the 
fourth a volume of essays. Such stories as " Marse 
Chan " and " Elsket " are not likely to lose their charm 
for more than one generation, and come very near to 
being classics in their kind. But Mr. Page, now that 
his " works " have been " collected," must not rest upon 
his oars; we expect to see the volumes at least doubled 
before the twentieth century is turned. 

CHARLES SUMNER'S oration of July 4, 1845, on " The 
True Grandeur of Nations," is one of the best examples 
of American patriotic literature. It has long been out 
of print, except as contained in the author's collected 
works, and the publishers (Lee & Shepard) have now 
issued it in a separate volume, thinking it may be found 
useful for schools as supplementary reading. Mr. 
John F. Genung's " Outlines of Rhetoric " (Ginn) is 
another recent publication of interest to teachers of En- 
glish in our schools. It is a very practical sort of book, 
abundantly provided with exercises. 

MR. W. R. ORNDORFF'S "Laboratory Manual" (Heath) 
gives directions for a series of eighty-two experiments 
in organic chemistry, arranged to accompany the text- 
book of Professor Remsen, who not only expresses his 
approval of the present volume, but also adds that " in 
many cases the directions given are undoubtedly better 
than those given in my book." With such an endorse- 
ment, the book ought speedily to find its way into our 
schools and colleges. 

THE " Religion of Science Library," which is to con- 
sist of paper-covered reissues of the publications of the 
Open Court Publishing Co., to appear bi-monthly, opens 
with "The Religion of Science," a simple and lucid 
sketch by Dr. Paul Cams. " Three Introductory Lec- 
tures on the Science of Thought," by Professor Max 
Muller, constitute the second number of this series of 
pamphlets. The " Epochs of Indian History " series 
(Longmans) is inaugurated by a little volume on " An- 
cient India," by Mr. Romesh Chunder Dutt. 

" THE Monastery," " The Abbott," and " Kenilworth " 
are the latest additions to the " Dryburgh " Waverly 
(Macmillan). Mr. John Williamson has illustrated the 
first two, and Mr. H. M. Paget the third of these 
novels. The work of the former artist is spirited and 
excellent in composition. The popular edition of Mr. 



William Black's novel, has recently been augmented by 
the publication of " White Heather " and " Labina Zem- 
bra" (Harper). This edition has no illustrations; ita 
modest price would hardly admit of them. 

VOLUME NINE of the " Cambridge " Shakespeare 
(Macmillan), edited by Mr. William Aldis Wright, 
completes the sumptuous reissue of that standard edi- 
tion. It includes " Pericles," the poems, and reprints 
of the eight early quartos, from " The Merry Wives of 
Windsor " to " Hamlet." The text of " Venus and 
Adonis " and " Lucrece " has been largely reconstructed, 
owing to the discovery of editions of those poems un- 
known to the editors of the original " Cambridge " text. 
The reprints of the quartos are really better than the 
photographic facsimiles, for the latter often make havoe 
with punctuation, owing to the small scale upon which 
they are reproduced. 

MR. WORTHINGTON CHAUNCEY FORD'S monumental 
edition of " The Writings of George Washington " (Put- 
nam) is at last complete. The fourteenth volume, now 
at hand, contains the letters of 1798 and 1799, an ac- 
count of Washington's last illness and death, a few mis- 
cellaneous papers, and a very complete general index to 
the fourteen volumes of the edition. Mr. Ford's work 
has been so well done that it can hardly be superseded 
by that of any future editor, and he deserves the hearty 
thanks of every student of American history. 

WE have received a second installment of the " Ariel " 
Shakespeare (Putnam), consisting of seven of the his- 
tories, each in a single boxed volume, with flexible 
leather covers, gilt tops, and untrimmed edges. The 
text of this edition appears to be an eclectic one, and 
no one is named as editorially responsible for it. A 
group of seven tragedies will be the next to appear, a 
similar group of the comedies having been noticed by 
us some months ago. 



NEW YORK TOPICS. 



New York, Oct. 10, 1893. 

. Memories of thirty years syne, of literary New York 
in war times, are recalled by the arrival at a famous- 
artistic and literary club in this city of the four thous- 
and volumes which comprise the late James Lorimer 
Graham's library. I shall attempt, further on, to con- 
vey some idea of the value of this bequest, now fulfilled 
seventeen years after the owner's death; but the chief 
interest of these books will always centre in Mr. Gra- 
ham's personality and in the associations which gather 
around his name. 

The old group of New York men of letters, repre- 
sented by Bryant, Willis, Curtis, and Tuckerman, bad 
held the field, both social and literary, for many years 
before the outbreak of the Civil War. Younger writ- 
ers, in the intervals of newspaper work or business of 
the most exacting kind, managed to get together in a 
semi Bohemian way. Their contributions to literature 
were largely restricted, however, to the columns of 
various free-lance journals, such as the " Saturday 
Press," the "Round Table," and the "Albion." Social 
recognition was a missing quantity. Of course, I da 
not mean recognition by fashionable society, then as 
now a shining mark for wits and satirists, but I refer 
to those more agreeable circles where the spirit of art 
prevailed. In these circles James Lorimer Graham 
had moved for a number of years, at the time I have 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

in mind. He came of a cultured family, and he was 
made independent by his marriage to Miss Josephine 
Garner, a New York belle of the day, whose relatives 
are wealthy people still. It was Willard Fiske, I be- 
lieve, who first brought Bayard Taylor to Mr. Graham's 
home in Washington Square. Its occupant already had 
gained reputation as a book collector, at a time when 
the art of book collecting in this country was in its 
infancy. A well-selected picture gallery added to the 
attractions of a house whose every guest felt that he 
was Lorry Graham's particular friend. One after an- 
other, the group of authors and artists to which Mr. 
Taylor belonged found their way to Graham's doors, 
and a social centre for the younger men was formed, 
the influences of which are felt to this day. 

Of all these friendships, that between the Grahams 
and Richard and Elizabeth Stoddard was probably the 
most intimate; but Taylor, Aldrich, Winter, Godkin, 
O. P. Cranch, Ho wells and Boker when in town, the 
artists Kensett, McEntee, Hicks, Bierstadt, and Launt 
Thompson, and their families, all frequented the Gra- 
hams'. Most of these gentlemen sooner or later became 
members of the Century Club, and this was a further 
bond of union between them. 

In 1866 Mr. and Mrs. Graham removed their home 
to Florence, where the former assumed the duties of 
United States consul. His departure was made the 
occasion of a memorable dinner, given by his friends 
and comrades, with poems and speeches galore. This 
event was impressed very thoroughly on the memory of 
one very small boy, by Mr. Graham's coming to our 
house the next morning and making a final effort to 
adopt him, the Grahams having no children of their 
own. But even the display of a great bag of imitation 
coins (some advertising device) was ineffectual, although 
the small boy's eyes were dazzled. Mr. Graham re- 
mained at Florence until his death in 1876, and became 
as noted for his hospitality there as in this country. 
Thackeray, Sala, Lord Houghton, Swinburne, Longfel- 
low, and many others, were his guests at either place, 
and his books are enriched with their inscriptions. 
Besides these personal gifts his library contains a large 
number of volumes bearing the autographs of other 
distinguished writers. There are also quantities of first 
editions, early printed books, standard editions of the 
classics of many languages, and bound volumes of val- 
uable prints, portraits, and autographs, which represent 
many years of careful searching on the part of Mr. 
Graham. And now that his wife has died, the books 
have come to keep his memory green in the club which 
he loved so well. It was Swinburne who wrote at his 

" Not a kindlier life or sweeter 

Time, that lights and quenches men, 
Now may quench or light again, 

Mingling with the mystic metre 
Woven of all men's lives with his 
Not a clearer note than this, 

Not a kindlier life or sweeter." 

Preparations are being made for a formal commem- 
oration of the death of Edwin Booth, to be given at the 
Music Hall, Madison Square Garden, on November 13, 
the sixtieth anniversary of Mr. Booth's birth. The ex- 
ercises are to be of an elaborate and impressive char- 
acter. Mr. Joseph Jefferson is expected to preside. 
Prof. George E. Woodberry will deliver an ode, and Mr. 
Parke Godwin, whose eloquent words commemorating 
Mr. Curtis still linger in the memory, will deliver the 
address. At intervals Shakespearian music will be 



rendered by Mr. Walter Damrosch and his orchestra. 
The proceedings are to be in charge of a committee of 
the Players Club, of which Mr. William Bispham, 
Booth's most intimate friend, is chairman. The Play- 
ers, it will be remembered, was founded by Mr. Booth, 
who presented to the club its home and many of his 
most precious relics. The latter are displayed behind 
glass in fire-proof safes, arranged to be open in the 
daytime. No doubt Mr. William Winter will be an 
honored guest of the occasion. He has just returned 
from a long sojourn in California, and is now busily 
occupied in seeing through the press his " Life and Art 
of Edwin Booth." This work, I hear, will contain six- 
teen full-page plates of the actor in different characters, 
besides many other illustrations. A limited edition is 
also to be published on handmade paper. I have been 
interested to observe the quick success of the neat- 
looking series of Mr. Winter's works published by 
Macniillau & Co. during the past two years. Thirty 
thousand of these little volumes were sold last fall, 
and their popularity is not by any means on the wane. 
That Mr. Winter's exquisite poetry and prose should 
at last be published in a commercially available form 
is a matter of gratification. They are none the less 
sensate with the spirit of his native land because they 
respond harmoniously to the song and tradition of Old 
England. 

Mr. Walter Damrosch has come back from his Eu- 
ropean trip in fine health and spirits. He has nearly 
completed his opera founded upon Hawthorne's " Scar- 
let Letter," for which Mr. George Parsons Lathrop has 
supplied the libretto. Probably one act will be ren- 
dered as a concert piece in December, but the stage- 
production will not take place until next season. 
Students of American music may like to know that 
Mr. Damrosch, after persistent questioning, admitted 
that there is none of that negro melody upon which 
Dr. Dvorak has recently based such high expectations.

LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

A new novel by Herr Felix Dahn, "Julian der Ab- 
triinnige," is to appear in October. It will be remem- 
bered that Dr. Ibsen has treated this subject dramat- 
ically in his " Emperor and Galilsean." 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. have just begun publica- 
tion, in a new edition, of the great work of Thiers, the 
" History of the Consulate and the Empire of France 
under Napoleon the First," in the authorized transla- 
tion of Mr. D. Forbes Campbell. 

Mr. Edward J. Harding, for two years past the lit- 
erary editor of the Chicago " Tribune," has retired from 
that position and accepted a business engagement which 
will fix his future residence in Biltmore, North Caro- 
lina, a lovely and healthful region. Mr. Harding's work 
represented the highest grade of newspaper criticism, 
and his retirement is hence a distinct loss to Chicago. 

Dr. Alexander B. Grosart rejoices in the possession 
of the identical copy of Robert Burns's Poems (1787) 
presented to William Cowper by Samuel Rose, Esq., 
and acknowledged in Cowper's letter dated at " Wes- 
ton, July 24, 1787 " (Bonn's Edition of Cowper, 8 vols., 
vol. III., pp. 383-4). The acquisition of this interest- 
ino- relic by Dr. Grosart has moved him to write a very 
lively note on the subject, which the curious may find 
in "The Bookman" for September. This note is a

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



burst of sentiment not unworthy of that M. de Latour 
who once found in a Paris bookstall J. J. Rousseau's 
copy of the "Imitatione Christi." 

The first number of the new " Psychological Review " 
will be published early in 1894, by Messrs. Macmillan 
& Co. It will be edited by Professor James Mark 
Baldwin, of Princeton University, with the collabora- 
tion of Professors Cattell, Dewey, Donaldson, Fuller- 
ton, James, Ladd, and Miinsterberg, and of M. Alfred 
Binet. These names afford a sufficient guarantee of 
the scientific and progressive character of the new un- 
dertaking, and yet they do not indicate too exclusive a 
leaning to the new psychology of the laboratory. Pub- 
lication will, we understand, be bi-monthly. 

We quote the following editorial note from the Lon- 
don " Literary World." Is it a joke ? " Hans Breit- 
mann, besides giving a certain historic ' barty,' has found 
time for adventures varied enough to make his forth- 
coming memoirs most interesting. He was one of the 
Knickerbockers, but abandoned journalism for original 
literary work. Then he became an educational re- 
former, and not till comparatively late in life did he 
find his real vocation as a poet. His poetical works are 
being prepared for publication in the following order: 
' The Book of Songs,' New Poems,' Atta Troll, Ger- 
many, and Romancers,' and ' Last Poems.' " 

" Popular Astronomy " is the title of a new scientific 
monthly for which we bespeak a welcome. It is edited 
by Professor W. W. Payne, of Northfield, Minnesota, 
who conducted " The Sidereal Messenger " for the ten 
years of its existence, and who, with the assistance of 
Professor George E. Hale, has edited " Astronomy and 
Astro-Physics " for the past two years. The new mag- 
azine is designed to interest amateurs and students, and 
the number just issued contains articles by the best En- 
glish and American writers, as well as a number of at- 
tractive illustrations. The periodical should find a place 
in every high school and college of the country, as well 
as in the library of every family of young people. 

An " Athenseum " reviewer has the following clearly 
personal note on Rossetti : " To say that any artist could 
take a deeper interest in the work of a friend than in 
his own seems bold, yet it could be said of Rossetti. 
The mean rivalries of the literary character, that so 
often make men experienced in the world shrink away 
from it, found no place in that great heart. To hear 
him recite in his musical voice the sonnet or lyric of 
some unknown bard or bardling recite it in such a 
way as to lend the lines the light and music of his own 
marvellous genius, while the bard or bardling listened 
with head bowed low, so that the flush on his cheek 
and the moisture in his eye should not be seen this 
was an experience that did indeed make the bardic life 
' worth living.' " 

THE "WESTERN SCHOOL" OF LITERATURE: 
AN EASTERN COMMENT. 

THE DIAL is glad to find its recent utterance on the 
subject of " The Literary West " commended by so ex- 
cellent an authority as the New York " Evening Post," 
which says : " There has been of late a general outbreak, 
in magazines and newspapers, of articles about culture 
and literature in the West, all of them prophesying, 
and some of them professing to have discovered, a new 
literary school in and about Chicago. This is variously 
described, but the one mark upon which all the critics 
and prophets agree is that the literature of the West 
is to be absolutely novel and original. It is to cut 
loose entirely from forms and standards prevalent in the 



East and in England, and it is at last to give the genu- 
ine American 'a voice.' After all this churning up of 
foam it is a relief to turn to the words of truth and so- 
berness spoken by the Chicago DIAL. With the great- 
est good sense it remarks: 

"' It is time to have done with the notion, forced upon us 
with wearisome iteration by certain writers, both Eastern and 
Western, that the West is now developing, or ever will de- 
velop, a distinctive literature of its own. The West and the 
East are peopled by the same sort of men and women, and 
their work, when it deserves the name of literature at all, 
has, and will have, the characteristics common to all good 
writing in the English language. The distinction between 
East and West will never be other than an artificial one ; 
even now many of the best writers of either section came to 
it from the other. If the national centre of literary activity 
follows the westward path of the centre of population, as 
seems probable, it will carry with it the accepted literary tra- 
dition, before which all crude local growths of tradition will 
be forced to give way. The coming literature of the West 
may be largely Western in its themes, but it will never be 
Western in its manner, as certain blatant rhetoricians would 
persuade us.' 

" That states the case in a way to leave nothing to be 
added, and we could wish that there were more such 
signs of sanity discernible, East or West." 

EMERSON'S FRIENDSHIPS THE IDEAL AND 

THE REAL. 

"What is so pleasant as these friendships, which 
make a young world for me again ? What so deli- 
cious as a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, 
in a feeling ? How beautiful the approach to us of the 
steps and forms of the gifted and the true ! I awoke 
this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends. 
I chide society, I embrace solitude, and yet I am not 
so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely, and the 
noble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate." 
Emerson, Essay on Friendship. 

" A few years ago, shortly after the death of Emer- 
son, an English visitor to the philosophic village of 
Concord was being shown the Emerson mansion by a 
native who was not a philosopher. ' This,' said the 
guide, ' is the garden Mr. Emerson was so fond of tend- 
ing; this is the path leading to his orchard- walk ; this 
is the window out of which he used to climb when he 
saw Mr. Alcott walking up to the front door at the op- 
posite side of the house." English Review. 

A RARE COPY OF WALTON'S ANGLER. 

A decided rarity in the old-book line has lately been 
imported to this country, and a gentleman at Cleveland, 
Ohio, is the fortunate possessor thereof. For over two 
years the Taylor-Austin Co. of that city have been 
searching for an early copy of the first edition of Wal- 
ton's Angler, and have just succeeded in obtaining an 
unusually perfect copy of the same for their customer. 
Although the price paid for this rare treasure is not 
stated, yet a fair idea of its value can be formed from 
the fact that the two last copies sold in London auc- 
tion rooms brought 235 and 310 respectively. A 
short description of this interesting book will not be 
amiss, as comparatively few persons have been fortun- 
ate enough to see a copy. 

It was issued in 1653, and the title-page describes 
it as "The Compleat Angler, or the Contemplative 
Man's Recreation, being a discourse of Fish and An- 
gling, not unworthy the perusal of most Anglers." 
The title is followed by a quotation from Scripture, not 
reproduced in the subsequent editions. Simon Peter 
said, I go a fishing; and they said, We also wil go with

thee. The book was printed by T. Maxey, for Rich. 
Harriot, in St. Dunstan's churchyard, Fleet Street, 
1653. During the progress of the printing, and after 
several copies had been sold, it was discovered that the 
word " contentment "had been misprinted " contention." 
This error has been worth thousands of dollars to deal- 
ers in " first editions " in this later day, as its presence 
marks the earliest impressions of the plates. It is pre- 
sent in the Cleveland copy, and unmistakably establishes 
its rarity and value. 

What would good old Izaak have thought, had he 
known that the book, no larger than one's hand, which 
he sold through Rich. Harriot's agency for eighteen 
pence would be resold two and a half centuries later for 
more than a thousand dollars ! 

THE TRIBULATIONS OF AUTHORSHIP: A CHAPTER 
OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. 

A writer in an English paper, who modestly describes 
himself as a " literary beginner," gives an interesting 
summary of his actual experience during the first five 
months of his novitiate, from which it will appear that 
industry and perseverance are qualities requisite to suc- 
cess in authorship as in other pursuits, and that aspir- 
ants for literary honors would do well not to expect too 
much in the beginning of their career. During the period 
named by this writer, he " wrote and offered to various 
journals sixty-seven articles and stories, of which twenty- 
seven were accepted, fifteen are ' under consideration,' 
and twenty-five are in the drawer set apart for rejected 
HSS. Some of these rejected ones," says our author, 
" will be sent off again; others are obviously faulty." 

Of the twenty-seven accepted HSS., we learn that 
"sixteen were accepted at the first offer, five at the 
second trial, two at the third time of asking, one at 
the seventh, and three were ' ordered ' by an editor on 
the strength of a lucky article which pleased him. 
The payments for these twenty-seven accepted HSS. 
amounted to 96. 7s." Further details are as follows: 
" The 27 accepted HSS. were, in the aggregate, sent 
out 42 times; the 15 which are 'out' have been offered, 
in the aggregate, 37 times; and the 25 which are in the 
* rejected ' drawer have received among them no fewer 
than 78 refusals. Thus the whole 67 HSS. have had 
a total of 157 separate trials. This means 31427=287 
journeys through the post, and up to the present time 
not a single HS. has been lost, a fact that speaks well 
for both editors and postmen. The cost of postage, 
both ways, of those 157 offers of HSS. has amounted to 
2. 5s. 2d. say 3 if paper be included; thus the net 
profit in respect of the 27 accepted HSS. is 96. 7s. 
less 3, or 93. 7s. The foregoing are actual facts," 
adds the writer, "and the result is by no means dis- 
couraging."

FALL ANNOUNCEMENT. 



THE BIBELOT SERIES. 

Mr. Thomas B. Mosher takes pleasure in announcing his new series of 
poetical reprints, under the above general title, which he believes will 
be found more than usually attractive to the book lover and buyer of 
choice editions. For the season of 1893 the following will be ready early 
in November : 

I. Songs of Adieu. 

A little book of recent English lyrics, compiled from sources that are 
not generally known, or inaccessible in this country. 

II. Old World Lyrics. 

A little book of translations from Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard, and later 
poets. It is believed that such dainty specimens of book-making will 
be welcomed by those who seek for themselves or as a gift to friends, 
something that will seem more exclusively their own than the ordinary 
booklet, pretty as it is but seen and sold on every counter. To prove 
that this is not only possible, but also attainable at a moderate price, the 
BIBELOT SERIES has been planned, and the first two volumes put 
to press. 

The BIBELOT SERIES is modeled on an old style format, narrow 
8vo, and beautifully printed on Van Gelder's hand-made paper, uncut 
edges ; done up in flexible Japan vellum wrapper, with original design 
in color, and each issue strictly limited to 725 copies. 

Price per Volume, $1.00 Net. 



7" Advance orders solicited, and specimen pages sent on 
application.

MEISTERSCHAFT SUPERSEDED 

BY ITS OWN AUTHOR, 

DR. RICHARD S. ROSENTHAL. 



Dr. Rosenthal's name has become a household word 
wherever foreign languages are studied. A new work, 

THE ROSENTHAL METHOD OF 
PRACTICAL LINGUISTRY, 

has just been issued by him, which does not only super- 
sede his former system, published twenty years ago, but 
will be found superior to any method. It is the ma- 
ture outcome of twenty-five years' experience of the 
greatest linguist and foremost teacher of the age, en- 
abling anyone to learn to 

SPEAK FLUENTLY AND CORRECTLY, 
with scarcely an effort and without a teacher, 

GERMAN, FRENCH, OR SPANISH, 
within a marvellously short time. 

"Next to living in a foreign country, this is undoubtedly- 
the best of all methods for learning modern languages." 
The Nation. 

Exact pronunciation given. All subscribers become 
actual pupils of Dr. Rosenthal, who answers all ques- 
tions and corrects all exercises free of charge. Terms 
of membership, $5.00 for each language. Part I., each 
language, 50 cts.

EDITION DE LUXE OF

EDITED BY WILLIAM ALDIS WRIGHT. 

NOW READY: 

The Tempest. The Two Gentlemen of Verona. 

The edition de luxe of the Cambridge Shakespeare will be comprised in 40 volumes Super Royal 8vo, each 
volume containing a single play, an arrangement which the publishers believe will commend itself to students and 
amateurs. It will be printed on fine cream-white hand-made paper, and bound in Irish linen. The impressions 
will be limited to 500 copies, a considerable number of which have been ordered for America. It will be issued 
at the rate of two volumes per month from October. The price is $2.00 per volume, but orders will be received 
only for complete sets.

Question," etc. With map. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 
The first edition having been exhausted soon after publication, a sec- 
ond edition has been printed, and is now ready at all booksellers'. 

"To say that nothing comparable with this most instructive and en- 
chaining volume has hitherto come from Prof. Smith's pen would per- 
haps be only anticipating the judgment of its readers." Toronto Mail. 
"It is a marvel of condensation and lucidity. In no other book is 
the same field covered so succinctly and so well. Of the five chapters, 
the first deals with the Colonial epoch, the second with the Revolution- 
ary period, the third and fourth review the history of the Federal Gov- 
ernment to the outbreak of the Civil War, and the fifth depicts the era 
of rupture and reconstruction. We have marked certain passages for 
extract, but the truth is that almost every page is enriched with strik- 
ing comments that cause the reader to carefully reconsider, if not to 
change, his views of historical persons and events." New York Sun.

A Spinster's Leaflets. 

By ALYN TATE KEITH. Cloth, illustrated, $1.25. 
This is not a series of regrets for a spoiled existence, nor has it any 
of the acid comment which is wrongfully associated with old maids. It is 
a segment of a mature and beautiful life. The " Leaflets " record the au- 
thor's experiences in a quaint home, situated in a charming neighbor- 
hood, and among the most natural people ever described. The ambition 
of the spinster was to bring up a boy, and the ostensible purpose of the 
book is to record her experiences among the boys while looking to find 
the right one for adoption. Incidentally she describes a village full of 
people, and contrives to make portraits of all who come into her plan. 
Also, she touches upon current topics and current literature, and shows 
not only perception and judgment, but a charming personality of her 
own.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



The Story of Washington. 

By ELIZABETH EGGLESTON SEELYE. Edited by Dr. ED- 
WARD EGGLESTON. With over 100 illustrations by ALLE- 
GRA EGGLESTON. A new volume in the " Delights of His- 
tory" Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

. This book will supply a demand for a life of Washington, 
the man, of convenient size, popular, including the latest re- 
sults of research, planned according to the methods of the 
new school of history, and containing illustrations of almost 
every available subject which the story includes. Mrs. Seelye's 
book is always interesting, and it is not encumbered with su- 
perfluous details. It is uniform with " The Story of Colum- 
bus," by the same author. 

The Country School in New England. 

By CLIFTON JOHNSON. With 60 illustrations from photo- 
graphs and drawings made by the author. 8yo, cloth, gilt 
edges, $2.50. 

This volume is so delightfully novel, quaint, picturesque, 
and so thoroughly infused with the fresh and unsophisticated 
spirit of childhood, that it inspires instant sympathy and ap- 
preciation. The author describes successive periods of the 
country school the winter and summer terms ; the scholars 
in their classes and at the blackboard ; their punishments ; 
their fishing and coasting ; their duties and amusements on the 
farm in short, the every-day life of the boys and girls of 
rural New England in the days of our fathers and our own. 
Every phase of his subject is aptly illustrated with pictures 
from life. 

Duffels. 

By EDWARD EGGLESTON, author of " Roxy," "The Hoosier 
Schoolmaster," "The Faith Doctor," etc. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.25. 
This new volume of fiction is certain of a cordial welcome. 

For an explanation of the title the reader is referred to the 

charming introduction which forms the author's prelude to 

his collection of admirable stories. 

The Art of Music. 

By C. HUBERT H. PARRY, M.A. 12mo, cloth, $4.00. 
A concise and admirable exposition of the growth and de- 
velopment of musical art, full of the kind of information which 
persons desiring to cultivate a taste in music ought to have. 

Speeches and Addresses of William 
McKinley. 

From his Election to Congress to the Present Time. Com- 
piled by JOSEPH P. SMITH, Librarian of the Ohio State 
Library. With Portraits on Steel of the author and others. 
8vo, 650 pages, cloth, $2.00. 

These selections, sixty-five in number, embrace a wide range 
of topics of absorbing public interest, and include the tariff, 
silver, Federal elections, pensions and the public debt, civil 
service reform, the Treasury surplus and the purchase of 
bonds, the direct tax bill, etc. 

The orator whose views are thus presented is the best au- 
thority of his party on most of the matters considered. An 
elaborate analytical Index gives the volume an encyclopedic 
character, which will be especially appreciated at the present 
time by the student of whatever political faith. 



Personal Recollections of Werner von 
Siemens. 

8vo, cloth, $5.00. 

In two very different fields the application of heat and 
the application of electricity Herr von Siemens gained pre- 
eminent distinction by his rare combination of scientific in- 
sight and power of practical utilization of his knowledge. He 
designed the ocean-cable ship Faraday ; an electric railway 
and an electric furnace were among others of his inventions ; 
and in this day of electrical progress the autobiography of 
this great electrician will possess a pertinent and exceptional 
interest. 

Miniatures from Balzac's Masterpieces. 

Translated and compiled by SAMUEL PALMER GRIFFIN and 
FREDERICK T. HILL. 16mo, cloth, 50 cents. 
In this little volume is collected much of the wit, philosophy, 

and keen analysis of human character for which Honore" de 

Balzac is so justly famous. 

Louisa Muhlbach's Historical Novels. 

New edition, 18 vols. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, per vol., $1.00. 
In offering to the public our new and illustrated 12mo edi- 
tion of Louisa Muhlbach's celebrated historical romances we 
wish to call attention to the continued and increasing popu- 
larity of these books for over thirty years. These romances 
are as well known in England and America as in the author's 
native country, Germany, and it has been the unanimous ver- 
dict that no other romances reproduce so vividly the spirit and 
social life of the times which are described. In the vividness 
of style, abundance of dramatic incidents, and the distinct- 
ness of the characters portrayed, these books offer exceptional 
entertainment, while at the same time they familiarize the 
reader with the events and personages of great historical 
epochs.

ANONYMITY IN LITERARY 
CRITICISM. 

The question of responsibility for criticism 
is one of the most difficult with which the liter- 
ary profession has to deal. Should it be signed 
or unsigned, personal or impersonal ; should it 
express the opinion of an individual or of an 
organ ? The question has been ably and am- 
ply discussed from both points of view, and 
both systems (in English-speaking countries, 
at least) have been found to work well in prac- 
tice. In behalf of the principle of anonymity 
it is argued, first, that criticism has increased 
weight when put forth with all the authority of 
a paper or review that has gained the confi- 
dence of the public ; second, that by this method 
alone is untrammelled criticism, free from per- 
sonal obligations or reservations, to be secured. 
Upon these two leading arguments the case 
for anonymity rests ; others are occasionally 
brought forward, but examination shows them 
to be either of a derivative nature or of minor 
importance. 

In behalf of the criticism for which personal 
responsibility is assumed, we are told, first, 
that all such criticism really is the work of in- 
dividuals, and that it is unworthy to pretend 
that it is anything else; second, that inten- 
tional unfairness is less likely to be displayed 
when authorship is avowed than when it is con- 
cealed ; third, that injustice is done to the critic 
himself when the periodical to which he con- 
tributes assumes all the credit for his work, 
and that this assumption reacts upon the work, 
tending to make it colorless and weak. 

It is hardly necessary for the editors of THE 
DIAL to state that the arguments for personal 
responsibility seem to them the weightier, since 
they have, from the start, adhered to the prac- 
tice of publishing signed criticisms of all the im- 
portant works reviewed. While granting that 
the impersonal system has some advantages, it 
seems to admit of still more abuses. The nature 
of these abuses has been succinctly set forth 
by Mr. Besant in a recent article. He says : 

" I should rejoice to see the custom of signing crit- 
icisms in literature and art become general, for several 
reasons. First, because it would instantly, I believe, 
demolish the flippant smartness and insolence with which 
some papers allow their columns to be disfigured 
smartness which disguises the fact that the critic knows 



250 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



nothing of his subject; it would force the writer at least 
to read the book; it would put an end to the reviewing 
of books in the batch; it would make the young critic 
anxious to advance his own name as a writer who can 
deliver carefully considered judgment in the courteous 
language of a gentleman; this language he would study 
to preserve in his work, or to learn if he had never 
learned it; and it would enormously raise the position 
and status of a critic in the eyes of the editor, as well 
as those of the reading public. That it would also rap- 
idly advance the capable critic in his own profession 
may be taken for granted." 

For these reasons, and for others of a similar 
character, we think it desirable that the au- 
thorship of literary criticism should, as a rule, 
be acknowledged. 

There is, however, one abuse connected with 
the system of signed reviews that requires a 
moment's consideration. When this system is 
in use, the temptation is strong to secure the 
names of well-known writers, regardless of their 
fitness for the work. We have far too much 
of this misdirected effort, both in the sensa- 
tional press of the day and of the month. Some 
periodicals of this sort display title-pages or 
tables of contents in which the names of their 
contributors appear in heavy-faced type, while 
the subjects of the contributions are printed 
in the most modest and inconspicuous of char- 
acters. In fact, one of the greatest vices of 
our periodical press is this willingness to ap- 
peal to the public ear by means of names rather 
than by means of serious and competent dis- 
cussion. When the subject considered is sub- 
ordinated to the personality of the man who 
writes about it, we have reached something 
very like a reductio ad absurdum of the sys- 
tem. At all events, we have shown how a sys- 
tem, excellent in principle, may be condemned 
by its own excesses. On the other hand, the 
anonymous system too easily lends itself to con- 
cealment of the poverty of the resources at the 
command of a review. When criticism is to be 
unsigned, there is an increased difficulty in ob- 
taining criticism of the best quality, and edi- 
tors will sometimes succumb to the temptation 
afforded by the fact that, however inefficient 
the work offered them may be, it must share 
in the general prestige of the periodical in 
which it appears. As regards the two abuses 
just considered, the one appears to be no more 
probable or dangerous than the other ; in either 
case, the abuse in question will not be charge- 
able to any editor who accepts the responsibil- 
ities of his position. In other words, the edi- 
tor who is determined to present his readers 
with serious and honest criticism will refuse 
to publish incompetent work, whether it come 



baited with a well-known name or bear no name 
at all. 

When we consider the influence upon the 
writer himself (assuming him to be competent) 
of the knowledge that his work is to be signed 
or unsigned, it seems to us that the argument 
for personally acknowledged criticism is much 
the better. It is so easy for the anonymous 
critic to be unfair, to allow his work to be col- 
ored by a personal prejudice against which it 
is impossible for the reader to be on his guard. 
The best of the anonymous reviews show occa- 
sional examples of very uncritical prejudice, 
which, as a rule obvious enough to the expert 
in such matters, is entirely unperceived by the 
average reader. Sometimes, indeed, the preju- 
dice is so deftly concealed as to impose upon 
the very elect. That this evil is greatly lessened 
when criticism is acknowledged should be ap- 
parent enough. There are cases, no doubt, in 
which the reviewer who is to sign his criticism 
will fail, for personal reasons, to speak out his 
whole mind, and an occasional work may, in 
consequence, receive a more generous measure 
of praise than it deserves. But this evil ap- 
pears to us of minor importance when com- 
pared with the evil of prejudice protected by 
anonymity, and unrestrained by any sense of 
personal responsibility. Without going as far 
as Schopenhauer, when he calls anonymity the 
" shield of all literary rascality," we may find 
a certain satisfaction in his vigorous denuncia- 
tion of the system. 

" It was introduced under the pretext of protecting 
the honest critic, who warned the public against the 
resentment of the author and his friends. But where 
there is one case of this sort there will be a hundred 
where it merely serves to take all responsibility from 
the man who cannot stand by what he Jias said, or pos- 
sibly to conceal the shame of one who has been cowardly 
and base enough to recommend a book to the public for 
the purpose of putting money into his own pocket. 
Often enough it is only a cloak for covering the ob- 
scurity, incompetence, and insignificance of the critic. 
It is incredible what impudence these fellows will show, 
and what literary trickery they will venture to commit, 
as soon as they know they are safe under the shadow 
of anonymity." 

There is much force in this, and there is pith 
in the author's further suggestion that a man 
should be answerable for what he writes, " at 
any rate with his honor, if he has any ; and if 
he has none, let his name neutralize the effect 
of his words." 

Thus we see that one of the two leading ar- 
guments for anonymity does not seem, upon 
careful examination, to be well based. The 
other argument that criticism bearing the

THE DIAL

authority of a review has greater weight than 
that which bears but the authority of an indi- 
vidual might be dismissed with the question : 
Why should criticism have any greater weight 
than attaches to the authority of its writer ? 
But there is really more than this to be said 
upon the subject. A critical periodical should 
be more than a mere collection of essays. It 
is a pitiful theory that regards a review as a 
mere dumping-ground for all sorts of opinions. 
A review should stand for something ; it should 
represent sane intelligence upon the subjects 
with which it is concerned ; it should march in 
the vanguard of thought. M. Zola, who has re- 
cently, in his address before the London Con- 
ference of Journalists, stirred up the question 
of anonymity, goes astray at this point. His 
plea is for personal responsibility in criticism, 
and is excellently urged, but he attempts to 
make an unreal distinction between political 
and literary criticism. He expresses the opin- 
ion that political discussion should be imper- 
sonal, and adds : 

" At the same time, I confess that if I recognize the 
necessity for anonymity in political matters, I am none 
the less surprised that it can exist in literary matters. 
Here I entirely fail to grasp the situation. I refer 
especially to articles of criticism, judgments pronounced 
upon the play, the book, the work of art. Can there 
be such a thing as the literature, the art of a party ? 
That discipline, average opinion, should prevail in pol- 
itics is certainly wise. But that a literary or artistic 
production should be adapted to suit the views of a 
whole party, that a scythe should be used to cut down 
everybody to the same level, that all should be mixed 
up in a common herd, in order to politely please your 
public, this I consider to be dangerous to the intellec- 
tual vitality of a nation. This sort of regimental crit- 
cism, speaking in the name of a majority, can only end 
in producing a mediocre, colorless literature." 

The mistake here is in the assumption that im- 
personal discussion, whether political or artis- 
tic, must be partisan. But it cannot for a mo- 
ment be admitted that either the one or the 
other is necessarily partisan, except in the 
sense that it must take the part of knowl- 
edge against ignorance, of intelligence against 
dulness, of sanity against eccentricity, of ra- 
tionality against irrationality. We do not de- 
cide against anonymous literary criticism be- 
cause of its assumed tendency to become parti- 
san, or to express average opinion it cannot 
well be the one, and ought not to do the other 
but for the far more cogent reasons above 
set forth, and also recognized by M. Zola else- 
where in his address. It must be remembered 
that a critical review has to deal with all sorts 
of subjects, not only with belles lettres, but 
with history and science and philosophy as 



well. The word partisanship has no meaning 
when applied to so wide a range of interests. 

Recurring once more to the main argument 
for anonymity, we would say, finally, that the 
criticism which is published in a review of high 
character and recognized authority does receive 
added weight from that very fact, if signed no 
less than if unsigned. We do not believe that 
the addition of a signature detracts from the 
authority of the criticism, and we are sure that 
it adds to the reader's confidence in the sincer- 
ity of the writer. If the name of the writer is 
well-known, his opinion comes with the added 
authority of the review in which it appears ; 
if the name is not well-known, the importance 
to be attached to the opinion will be measured, 
not by the obscurity of the writer, but by the 
confidence which the editorial conduct of the 
review inspires. In a word, when critical arti- 
cles are signed, there is at least no loss of 
weight, and there may be a distinct increment 
of gain. The last editions of the " Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica " and of Chambers's " Ency- 
clopaedia " are the better and the more author- 
itative from the fact that their chief contribu- 
tions are acknowledged. "The Fortnightly 
Review," with its signed articles, quickly gained 
a higher prestige than had been enjoyed by the 
anonymous quarterlies. If " The Athenaeum " 
and " The Saturday Review " and " The Na- 
tion," following the example of " The Acad- 
emy " and THE DIAL, were to adopt the sys- 
tem of signed criticisms, they would probably 
exert a deeper influence than they do at pres- 
ent, and would certainly command a more un- 
reserved confidence from their constituency. 



THE WORLD'S CONGRESS 
AUXILIARY. 

The Chicago Congresses of 1893 were for- 
mally closed on the 28th of October. On the 
morning of this date a final meeting was held 
at the Chicago Art Institute, attended by mem- 
bers of the various Committees of Organiza- 
tion, and presided over by President Charles 
C. Bonney. A report by the Secretary of the 
Auxiliary, Mr. C. E. Young, was read, and 
brief addresses were made by a number of peo- 
ple. President Bonney, whose nearly four 
years' untiring labor as the originator and ac- 
tive head of the Auxiliary has been crowned 
with such signal success, gave, in his farewell 
address, an elaborate review of its history and 
of the work accomplished. There have been 



252 



[Nov. 1, 



held in all more than two hundred separate 
Congresses, with a total of over twelve hundred 
sessions, nearly six thousand speakers, and an 
aggregate attendance of about seven hundred 
thousand. Eminent men and women from all 
parts of the world actively participated, and 
among the papers read were many of lasting 
value, whose importance can only be known to 
the world at large by the permanent publica- 
tion that is contemplated and is so much to be 
desired. We have space only for a few of the 
more significant passages of President Bonney's 
address : 

"The World's Congresses of 1893 were organ- 
ized to establish fraternal relations among the lead- 
ers of mankind ; to review the progress already 
achieved ; to state the living problems now awaiting 
solution, and to suggest the means of future ad- 
vancement. To promote those high ends, the 
World's Congress Auxiliary provided for the pre- 
sentation of the intellectual and moral progress of 
mankind, in connection with the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition, in a series of World's Congresses 
under the auspices of the Auxiliary, with the assist- 
ance of the leaders in the various departments of 
human achievement. The work of organization 
commenced in October, 1889, was completed, and 
the first Congress of the series opened, in May, 
1893. The last Congress embraced in the great 
scheme has just been held. That these Congresses 
have been successful far beyond anticipation ; that 
they have transformed into enduring realities the 
hopes of those who organized and conducted them ; 
and that they will exercise a benign and potent 
influence on the welfare of mankind through the 
coming centuries, has been so often, so emphat- 
ically, and so eloquently declared by eminent rep- 
resentatives of different countries and peoples, that 
these statements may be accepted as established 
facts. That the material exhibit of the World's 
Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park is the most 
complete and magnificent ever presented to human 
view, is generally agreed; but a multitude of emi- 
nent witnesses have declared, after attendance on 
both, that the intellectual and moral exposition of 
the progress of mankind presented in the World's 
Congresses of 1893 is greater and more imposing 
still. Thus the work of the World's Congress Aux- 
iliary of the World's Columbian Exposition takes 
its enduring place in human history." 

After a few remarks upon the press reports, 
the minor Congresses, and the serious charac- 
ter of the audiences participating, the address 
was continued as follows : 

" Another feature of the Congresses deserves es- 
pecial mention. It is their self-governing quality. 
There has been little need for the enforcement of 
rules and regulations. Few speakers have given 
occasion for a call to order. The spirit of order, de- 



corum, dignity, and peace has been sovereign dur- 
ing the sessions of these Congresses. This ruling 
spirit has so promptly rebuked any attempt to over- 
step the limits of propriety as to leave little occa- 
sion for presiding officers to exercise their author- 
ity ; little occasion to guard seats reserved for del- 
egates, or to insist upon tickets or badges of ad- 
mission. The machinery of organization and the 
general regulations adopted for the government of 
the Congresses have proved remarkably satisfac- 
tory." 

The following justly deserved tribute was 
paid to the local committees, who had so es- 
sential a share in the work of the Auxiliary : 

"The time now at my command will not permit 
me even to name the many Committees of Organiza- 
tion by which the various Congresses were arranged. 
It is, however, both my duty and my pleasure to 
say of them that the fidelity, the patience and the 
zeal, the ability, the discrimination and the execu- 
tive skill with which the chairmen and members of 
the more than two hundred committees of organi- 
zation have conducted the correspondence, made the 
arrangements and formed the programmes for the 
more than two hundred Congresses which have been 
held in the twenty departments of the Auxiliary, 
constitute one of the marvels of the World's Con- 
gress work. The discipline and subordination which 
have attended the execution of the great and com- 
plicated scheme would do honor to the best organ- 
ized department of any government. So efficiently 
and so silently have these committees done their 
work that the great public they have served needs 
to be reminded of their part in the splendid results 
achieved. A publication which will present the full 
membership of these and the other Committees of 
the World's Congress Auxiliary is in contempla- 
tion." 

The question of publication of the proceed- 
ings of the Congresses was thus further touched 
upon : 

" The extraordinary merit of the proceedings of 
the whole series of Congresses renews our confidence 
that the Government of the United States, which 
sent our publications and communications through- 
out the world, and gave the World's Congress Aux- 
iliary an exalted position as the duly authorized 
agency to organize and conduct the World's Con- 
gresses of 1893, will furnish the means to publish 

o 7 * 

the entire proceedings in an enclyclopaedic form, 
and send the same to the colleges, the universities, 
and the leading libraries of the countries which 
have participated in the World's Columbian Expo- 
sition, as the most appropriate, enduring, and valu- 
able testimonial of the appreciation by the American 
people of the cooperation and aid of the other peo- 
ples of the world in the great events of this quadro- 
centennial year. To that end, let all who have been 
interested in the Congresses exert their influence in 
favor of such a publication and distribution."

THE MASTER OF BALLIOL. 

When we wrote about the late Dr. Jowett in our 
last issue, we predicted that the comment of the 
reviews would be largely personal in character. It 
could hardly be otherwise in the case of a man 
whose personality was so striking, and who so 
strongly impressed those who were associated with 
him at Oxford. We have made a few extracts 
from the notices elicited by the news of his death, 
taking them mostly from English sources. The 
Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, whom the death of no dis- 
tinguished Englishman finds unprepared, promptly 
sent the following sonnet to the "Academy": 

" aged head ! never-aging face ! 

O cheery hand-shake, wise and twinkling eye ! 
Ours until memory of all good shall die, 
Master, gone on before a moment's space ! 
Our hearts are all at Oxford, see thee pace 
The green quadrangle, watch thee standing by 
That oriel window, whence philosophy 
Would pause to wonder at the chestnut's grace, 
Or smile on young men's frolic. Thou art dead ! 
But never dead thy daring still to prove 
The Truths men live by ; one against the world ! 
Nor dead thy calm that met the tempest hurled, 
The quiet following of the Christ thy head, 
In deeds of pure self-sacrifice and love." 

In the "Academy" appears also an article signed 
" J. S. C.," which comes to the following conclu- 
sion: 

" It was impossible to be in Jowett's company even 
if, as sometimes happened, he did not open his mouth 
without recognizing that he was a remarkable man. 
That noble forehead with its nimbus of silver hair, that 
mild eye and cherubic countenance, that beautiful soft- 
ness of hand, that small rotund figure clad in old-fash- 
ioned garb, that venerable bearing all combined to 
make up a picture which no painter has adequately re- 
produced. Add the thin, small voice, the deliberate 
intonations that could be either bitter or sweet, the 
abrupt questionings that sometimes quivered like a dart, 
the intervals of silence that were yet more formidable, 
the wise maxims that come only from age and experi- 
ence; and some part of the secret of Jowett's charm 
will be understood. No Oxford don had a wider circle 
of acquaintance in the outer world; none knew inti- 
mately so many generations of undergraduates. He 
possessed, in supreme measure, that power, invaluable 
to statesmen and generals, of penetrating the character 
of others at a glance. Of his exceeding kindness to in- 
dividuals, and of his munificence when such was needed, 
it is not necessary to speak. His college stood to him 
in the place of a wife, and he took a paternal interest 
in the careers of its sons. Of the affection with which 
they regarded him, some instances have been seen this 
very week. But there is no Oxford man, however much 
opposed he may have occasionally felt to Jowett's teach- 
ing, who will not recognize, at the moment of his death, 
that the university has lost its grandest figure." 

The opinion of the "Saturday Review" is thus 
non-committally given: 

" Of Mr. Jowett's great intellectual ability there 
could be but one opinion, and he combined with it a 
knowledge of the world unusual in the case of a scholar 
and a man of great reserve and shyness who lived all 



his life in academic surroundings. By a combination 
of personal influence over undergraduates, and of adroit 
management of the patronage which was put in his 
hands by governments (not, we believe, of one party 
only), he raised his college to a position unequalled in 
its peculiar way, or only equalled by Christ Church 
under Dean Cyril Jackson long ago. Assisted by his 
pupils, he gave to the common English reader as easy 
an access to the two greatest prose authors of Greece 
Plato and Thucydides as anyone can have without 
Greek, and so gained that reader's ear and suffrage. 
For the rest, his character and career, both public and 
private, were regarded by different classes of persons 
with respect, with disapproval, with affection, with dis- 
like in a degree most unusual." 

Another paragraph from the same paper dwells 
upon the conservative aspect of his mind : 

" His youth was passed among historical doubters, 
and he did not change with the times. He never took 
much interest in archaeology or anthropology as illus- 
trative of history. Probably he did not actually disbe- 
lieve that hieroglyphics had been interpreted, and cunei- 
form texts deciphered, but there may have survived a 
grain of doubt upon the actuality of such studies. 
Epigraphy, the study of Greek inscriptions, he almost 
publicly scouted, saying that inscriptions had much the 
same interest as autographs. New pursuits were not 
dear to him, and, while some of the erudite sneered or 
marvelled, his friends only smiled to see how simple 
and how conservative was the mind of this heresiarch. 
The epigram about ' what I know not is not knowledge ' 
was little more than a humorous exaggeration. His 
' ply was taken long ago,' and the Master never knew 
how antique some of his opinions really were. Yet 
' gladly would he learn,' especially in conversation with 
men who had seen and done great things, who had been 
conversant with affairs and with adventures. The shy 
college don knew how to war against his mood, how to 
make and keep friends among men of the wide world, 
statesmen, travellers." 

The following comment is from the London 
" Literary World ": 

" No man did so much to adapt the University to mod- 
ern needs. From the time his replies helped to guide 
the Commission of 1852 in their work of making the 
colleges open to all instead of being a collection of 
close clerical corporations, through the agitations for 
strengthening the University at the expense of the col- 
leges, enlarging the professoriate, establishing scholar- 
ships, admitting unattached students, and recently 
University Extension, he has always been protagonist 
on the liberal side. His books are very variously esti- 
mated by scholars, and perhaps are more useful to 
reader and thinker than to a trained critic ; but it is no 
mean performance to have 'made Plato an English 
classic,' as has been said. His direct influence on the 
men, too many to enumerate, who have gone out from 
his tuition to influence the world in politics, law, and 
literature, is a surer monument; and we may say safely 
that far more in our modern thought than one would 
naturally ascribe to him is due to the influence of Ben- 
jamin Jowett." 

The progressive aspect of Jowett's mind is em- 
phasized by the " Athenaeum " article, which explains 
in some detail the nature of his work for the Uni- 
versity.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



"In the government of the University he played an 
important part, and one which even those who widely 
differed from him would allow was worthy of himself. 
Liberalism has not in the University, any more than in 
the political world, always meant the same thing or 
moved in the same direction. But from the time of the 
first Commission in 1852 down almost to that of Lord 
Salisbury's Commission in 1877, the efforts of the Lib- 
eral party in the University were mainly directed to- 
wards opening wider the doors of the University to 
classes, creeds, and studies hitherto excluded, and to 
improving the educational machinery within it. With 
this older Liberalism Jowett was heartily in sympathy. 
No man had ever a keener sense of the duty which the 
University owes to the nation, or was more anxious to 
keep it in touch with the world outside; at the same 
time nothing was more repugnant to him than ineffi- 
cient or slack administration. Such movements as those 
for the admission of non-collegiate students, for the 
extension of University teaching in large towns, and for 
the affiliation of local colleges found in him a warm 
friend and powerful advocate. More recently he in- 
terested himself actively in drawing closer the ties be- 
tween Oxford and India by facilitating the training of 
the selected candidates for the Indian Civil Service, 
and by obtaining for Oriental languages a recognized 
place among University studies. To one form, indeed, 
which the movement for the expansion of the Univer- 
sity assumed, to the proposal for admitting women to 
University examinations, he was at first opposed; but 
it was characteristic of him that when once convinced 
that the demand was a genuine one, he withdrew his 
opposition." 

Recurring once more to the personal view of the 
Master, we make our final extract from the very 
interesting contribution of W. J. A. to the New 
York " Evening Post ": 

"Jowett's person was, like his mind, dainty. An 
irreverent writer once spoke of his face as of the tomb- 
stone-cherub order; and the phrase was descriptive. 
But cherubs too frequently have something gross in 
their chubbiness; and everything about the Master was 
delicate and fine. Perhaps it was his appearance which 
helped to create the affection which mingled with our 
awe and respect; he was the Doctor Seraphicus of the 
college. Yet we trembled when we had to go and see 
him, even at a breakfast party, to say nothing of less 
agreeable occasions. In his clear little staccato voice 
he could say such biting things. Many were the stories 
of breakfast parties with long silences, broken by the 
more adventurous, who suffered accordingly; of under- 
graduates taken for walks and left to make the conver- 
sation with painful results to themselves. What was 
the explanation ? we asked ourselves. Did the Master 
enjoy discomfitting the shallow with his rapier thrusts ? 
or could it possibly be that after all these years, he was 
still shy himself, and said what he did because he could 
not help it ? Probably the last theory, if not complete, 
was the truer. And certainly the undergraduate or 
voung graduate who had anything really to say, how- 
ever contrary it might be to the Master's opinion, and 
was so interested in the subject that he forgot the mas- 
tership and spoke out freely, was sure to win Jowett's 
esteem. Such a conversation, which the young man 
when he came to his ordinary self thought of with won- 
der and a flushed face, was not seldom followed by an 
invitation to dinner." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEWSPAPERS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have been an interested reader of the recent dis- 
cussion, in THE DIAL and elsewhere, of what may be 
called the newspaper problem. There is enough need of 
a campaign for the improvement of our journals. The 
fact, however, must not be lost sight of that the daily 
papers are commercial enterprises, and we cannot hope 
that as such they will rise higher than the demands of 
their subscribers and readers. The commercial success 
of a paper depends mainly upon a large advertising pa- 
tronage and a large number of subscribers. The adver- 
tising patronage depends upon the number of subscribers. 
It is therefore necessary that the paper, in order to get the 
largest financial return, should make itself acceptable to 
the largest practicable number of readers. We are thus 
brought to the moral and intellectual status of the com- 
munity as the basis of determination as to what the nature 
of the paper shall be. I have not myself much faith that 
the newspapers will very greatly improve except through 
what may be called the moralization of the community 
at large. When there is an outcry against the moral 
tone of a paper sufficient to reduce its patronage, it is 
likely to improve in order to regain or increase its pres- 
tige. Further than this, it may be said that every edi- 
tor probably desires to make his paper as good as he 
thinks he can afford to make it. This desire comes from 
the very general wish, on the part of editors as well as 
others, to merit and receive the esteem of the better 
class of their fellow-men. Through this fact there is 
an unmistakable advantage to be gained from the crit- 
icism of any particular paper which may seem to fall 
below the requirements of the proper moral standard.

MR. JOHN BURROUGHS ON POE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Without taking up the cudgels for Poe and trying 
to think of one real thing made more dear to us by his 
matchless rhyme, without depreciating our New En- 
gland poets and hinting that it might have been yet 
better had they cared a little more for art, one may still 
feel that all is not for the best in the remarks of Mr. 
John Burroughs in your last number (unless, perhaps, 
we at once turn the page and consider some of the ques- 
tions put by Mrs. Woolley toward the beginning of her 
communication). It is doubtless true that there are 
many with whom the purely art value, so-called, is the 
only thing to consider in a poem or a picture. But the 
number of such is, on the whole, small. It is quite 
right to say that with most readers this view is held 
less and less in sight. We in America, at least, need no 
incitement to value literature, or anything else, for its 
practical worth, or for what may seem such. If we 
need caution, it is on the other side. We do not need 
to be told that thought is important, we know it is, and 
we are always on the lookout for it. But we do need 
to be told that art or style is of value too, for, as a rule, 
we are not so much on the lookout for that; or, if we 
are, we don't know it so well when we see it. 

The more we are told by critics whom we honor (like 
Mr. John Burroughs) that thought is important and 
that art counts for less, the more do we fall into the 
error that thought is all-important and that art counts 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

for nothing, and then we have poems like Miss Emily 
Dickinson's, for example. 

Now style, or form, or art, or whatever else one may 
call it, is important. And, more to the point, style is 
difficult. It is difficult to attain, and it is, on the whole, 
difficult to appreciate. That it is difficult to appreciate 
good style, may seem a hard saying; one may think 
that if a thing be done in the best way everybody will 
recognize it. It is not so. To appreciate style needs 
training. And this training we in America will not 
undergo, so long as we are told that art is unimportant. 

One great use of the " full-blown professional liter- 
ary critic " is that he is apt to insist on art for art's sake. 
And one great good thing in a poet like Poe is that he 
shows us what art for art's sake can do. There is small 
danger that we shall go too far with either. There are 
comparatively few so constituted by nature that they 
ever could enjoy art for art's sake if they wanted to. 
There is little danger that we shall go too far in that 
direction. The important thing is that we go at all. 
And go some way we must, or literature runs down-hill, 
and at the bottom we have a horde of writers with 
plenty of thought perhaps, with plenty of messages for 
their time, with plenty of feeling for life, and with the 
highest ethical or sociological aspirations, but no style 
at all because they don't know what it is. 

Especially here in the West do we need to be con- 
stantly reminded of the value of art, to be taught what 
is style, to be told even (though it isn't so) that form in 
art is everything. We are not likely to take it too much 
to heart, and we may learn something from it. I some- 
times almost wish that Mr. Oscar Wilde would come 
out here again. He could hardly get us to be like Gil-

THE DECORATIVE SCULPTURE AT THE FAIR, 

AND ITS PRESERVATION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of all that was grand at the World's Fair, the en- 
semble of buildings, grouped as they were around the 
courts and lagoons, and on the shore of the lake, was 
undoubtedly the grandest. To my mind, it gave the 
chief magnificence to the Exposition. When the archi- 
tectural parts are poor they make such a fair only a 
big " show," but no aesthetic display. At Chicago, how- 
ever, the classical architecture imitated in the chief 
halls of exhibit gave the whole complexity of crowded 
busy life a most elevated, almost solemn, character, that 
has certainly not been equalled since the days of Rome. 

Next to the buildings, however, the sculptural work 
such as the decoration of the edges of the roofs, the 
entrances, the borders of the lagoons caught the eye 
of the somewhat satiated traveller. Occasionally one 
was too much reminded of foreign models, somewhat 
distasteful to our more severe minds; for example, the 
group at one of the entrances to the Horticultural 
Building, where the background of the statuary is made 
up of substantial plaster clouds. That is almost too 
much in the line of the purely decorative. Other 
groups, however, that were not connected with any 
building, but were isolated and free, pleased the eye 
as something original and truly monumental. Thus, 



the statues flanking the staircase leading into the canal 
from the Machinery Hall gave me a genuine pleasure. 
They represent two young men returning from the field 
with their horses. These statues certainly were among 
the most vivid impressions received at the Fair. They 
had, however, their pendants on the opposite side, in 
virgins leading oxen to sacrifice. How flat those Vic- 
tories were when compared with their counterparts ! 
There is a certain exaggeration in the imitation of clas- 
sical style nowadays that does not contrast favorably 
with the simple portrayal of real life. The latter has 
all the freshness of what is seen and known; while those 
maids with palms in their hands seem studied and ar- 
tificial rather than original iq sensation, and do not 
move our imagination except by an effort. Perhaps one 
reason is that the bull is too massive and the virgin too 
lean. How much more should I have wished to see a 
milkmaid as she appears abroad, in her national cos- 
tume, leading her cow to grass, or resting her arms on 
the back of the leader of the herd, a strong-limbed 
woman, with her hair bare, a kerchief around her neck, 
and home-made shoes ! But the American ideal of a 
woman, even in the farming class, is not that of broad- 
limbed health, but of slender physique and a certain 
air de societe that bears no resemblance to the simple 
child of nature. Thus, of a woman to match the splen- 
did figure of a farmer such as the limitless stretches of 
fertile soil produce in America, there is no representa- 
tion, only the high-stepped classical version of a wing- 
less Nike, a compliment I hope no American woman 
failed to see while passing the groups. In the groups 
of plough-horses with their drivers, no effort is needed 
to transport us into an atmosphere congenial to the mo- 
tif represented. What we see, we see as a recollection 
from nature, and it charms us as such chiefly because 
it is in itself beautiful. The well-built horse is massive, 
but not clumsy. What a power is latent in his strong 
limbs, his broad breast ! he bends his neck proudly, as 
if knowing how much he can perform; with no broken 
courage, ready to attempt whatever he is led to. And 
the young man, with his straight well-developed body, 
his energetic bearing, his healthy appearance, and loose 
clothing, seems a fair representation of the strong sin- 
ewy set that builds up the country and is the foundation 
of all its welfare, bred and grown under the lumi- 
nous blue sky of America, hardened and strengthened 
by work in the open air. 

Another pair of statues to which I also took a great 
liking were the two horsemen in front (if I am not mis- 
taken) of the Transportation Building. They represent 
an Indian and a Mexican, both in characteristic atti- 
tudes. They seem the only ones that, besides the 
ploughboys, could be said to be reproductions of Amer- 
ican life. The Indian I think is in himself an excellent 
object for statuary. His sinewy body, his partial naked- 
ness, his picturesque buskins, the agility and nervous 
fire shown by himself as well as by his animal, offer a 
splendid illustration of primitive military spirit; while 
the Mexican, with his more elegant attire, his proud 
bearing, his superior degree of culture and native grace, 
offers another illustration that is many degrees higher, 
although both figures are interesting and original. 

As I looked at these splendid pieces, I became ab- 
sorbed with the thought: what a pity that such pic- 
turesque groups will soon be a heap of plaster, and 
disappear ! What an acquisition to a park for the city, 
if these monuments could be preserved, transformed into 
a durable material like bronze ! Perhaps the expend-

iture of the Exposition has already proved too great, and 
prevents the preservation of the buildings; but groups 
like those of the ploughboys, and the Mexican and his 
mate, would commemorate a new phase of sculpture in 
America. At any rate, may it be pardoned, if, under 
the recollection of their merits, their preservation is sin- 
cerely wished by A TRAVELLING EUROPEAN.

A "WESTERN STYLE" IN LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The recent editorial in THE DIAL on " The Literary 
West " was doubtless read with approval by very many, 
but more especially, perhaps, by such' as had recently 
considered Mr. Walter Besant's views on the by him 
newly discovered " Western Literature," as expressed in 
his letter to the London Times." The idea that " The 
West " as a distinct province of the United States should 
of right have a characteristic literature of its own is, I 
suppose, new to many thoughtful persons, but is ap- 
proved probably by very few. 

It is true that, at present at least, a great part of the 
literature produced by Western writers will have a dis- 
tinctly local or sectional coloring. The present preva- 
lence of the so-called dialect poem and the dialect story, 
or, indeed, of realistic fiction of any kind, renders it 
natural that in many cases Western writers should se- 
lect particularly Western subjects. 

But that there should ever be a style that could be 
called characteristically " Western " is by no means to 
be hoped for or desired. Some of the most markedly 
Western qualities are such as would be ruinous to a good 
style. In this matter the best authors are, and delight 
to be, conservative: they recognize to a great degree con- 
ventional usage and established authority. The free- 
dom and individualism, the push and enterprise, of West- 
ern life are qualities that have done a great deal for the 
material growth of the West; but they will hardly accom- 
plish so much in the production of a good style. On 
the other hand, they will be apt to hinder it. And the 
West has other characteristics by no means so admir- 
able as these named and far worse in their effect on lit- 
erature. 

We must, I believe, hold tenaciously to the idea ex- 
pressed toward the close of the article referred to, that 
" Except in their relation to choice of subject matter 
the terms Eastern and Western, Northern and South- 
ern, have absolutely no literary meaning in a country 
all of whose parts have a common speech."

A CURIOSITY OF LITERARY STYLE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The service which Dr. Fitzedward Hall has rendered 
to the cause of good English is beyond estimation. The 
writer is one of a large number who have read his con- 
tributions to " The Nation " and THE DIAL with great 
profit. This pleasure has not been enhanced, however, 
by a peculiarity of style which the following quotations 
may serve to exemplify: 

"And here, not unfitly, I may quote De Foe and Sterne, as 
having, with, presumably, many another, at least seemed " 
etc. ("The Nation," xlvi., p. 215.) 

"Most all, with most any, etc., may, in like manner, have 
reappeared, in very late times, quite independently " etc. 
(Ibid., p. 342.) 

"Having chanced on a parcel of notes, long ago mislaid, I 



find that, taken with some recent memorandums, they enable 
me to supplement, on several points, and those not unimpor- 
tant, the details given, under these words, in the New En- 
glish Dictionary." (Ibid., liv., p. 10.) 

"And, as were, with him, our forefathers, so, by the logic 
of antipathy, were their descendants, down to the latest." 
(Ibid., p. 11.) 

The broken character of these sentences is painful, even 
to the eye; but its full effect can be realized only by 
an attempt to read them aloud. In some cases, to be 
sure, the difficulty is nothing more than the insertion of 
the comma where there is no break in thought sufficient 
to call for its presence. In THE DIAL of August 16, 
1893, we read: " But, for all that, it chances, curiously 
enough, that, in nearly all cases," etc. The first ten 
words of this sentence embrace five commas, two of 
which are of no apparent utility and are not sustained 
by Dr. Hall's own usage in many similar cases. 

The following sentence would surely be much im- 
proved by the removal of commas, and the slight changes 
in order which their removal might require: 

" Accordingly, I doubt whether ' none but they ' and ' no- 
body but I,' which, in the diction of prose, were, already in 
Gray's age, dropping out of literary currency, are, for us, 
altogether faultless." (THE DIAL, Oct. 1, p. 180.) 

I am unacquainted with Dr. Hall's books, but a glance 
at the preface of " Modern English " reveals the fol- 
lowing: 

" But, let Englishmen scorn us, and move our just aver- 
sion, as they may, the fact still stands, that, looking to their 
superior culture, literary and social, we shall do wisely " etc. 

Again: 

" Yet, to risk a negative, expressed or implied, if perilous 
in any case, is, above all, perilous, when it concerns an article 
of language." (Ibid., p. 96.) 

And yet again: 

" We are admonished, too, that, as to starve, because it 
meant, with our remote forefathers, more than it now means, 
namely, 'perish from cold, hunger, etc.,' we are ' inaccurate,' 
in limiting its application;" etc. (Ibid., p. 280.) 

One has to penetrate no farther than the second sen- 
tence of the treatise on English Adjectives in -able to find 
ten commas embraced within a group of thirty-six words : 

"Subsequently, however, on thinking over the matter, I 
found, that, in order to treat, with desirable thoroughness, of 
Reliable and words similar, it was necessary to survey, in 
connexion with them, our adjectives in -able generally." 

While turning, the pages of " Exemplifications of 
False Philology," I noted the following: 

" Long ago, it may be presumed, the reader has discovered, 
in Mr. White, the peculiarity, that, when he employs lan- 
guage which," etc. (P. 70.) 

These citations are surely sufficient in number, range, 
and character, to indicate a persistent feature of the au- 
thor's style. Perhaps, at a moment's notice, he might 
fill a whole page of THE DIAL with parallels from the 
writers of a half-dozen centuries. We venture the opin- 
ion, however, that they would not be from writers who 
have won any reputation for graceful expression of 
their ideas. 

We do not forget that the nature of Dr. Hall's work 
required the frequent insertion of a long series of partic- 
ulars separated by commas. Sentences affected by this 
necessity have no connexion with the above discussion. 

In closing, the writer desires to reiterate his grati- 
tude to Dr. Hall for many and valuable lessons in the 
use of words. w> H . JOHNSON.

THE REPUBLIC or TEXAS, AND ITS 
PRESIDENT.* 

Mr. Williams's Life of Sam Houston is at 
once a good piece of biography, and a concise, 
lucid account of an historical event that is usu- 
ally vaguely conceived and sometimes grossly 
misstated. A typical instance of this miscon- 
ception as well as of the facility with which 
the British mind contrives to read American 
history to American disadvantage is seen in 
the following paragraph, touching the war of 
Independence in Texas, from Mr. Goldwin 
Smith's recent book on the United States : 

" Houston, an American filibuster and an old comrade 
of Jackson, with a body of intrusive Americans, had 
planted himself in Texas, which belonged to the Repub- 
lic of Mexico, and when the Mexicans took arms to put 
him down and recover their province, had defeated them 
at the battle of San Jacinto." 

That is to say, the Texan war was simply an 
effort on the part of the Mexican government 
to oust a band of marauding Americans who 
had been led over the border by Sam Houston. 
As a matter of fact Houston did not set out for 
Texas until about two years after hostilities had 
virtually begun ; and the Texan revolt was, as 
our author shows, in its original character, not 
a filibuster enterprise pure and simple, but an 
uprising of recognized colonists against the 
oppression of a revolutionary and illegitimate 
government. That there was throughout the 
war an accompanying element of filibustering 
and intrigue is undeniable. The fact remains, 
nevertheless, that Mr. Smith's " body of intru- 
sive Americans" resolves itself on inspection 
largely into a body of established citizens who 
represented about all there was in the province 
of Texas of thrift, enterprise, and capacity for 
developing its resources. The inhabitants of the 
representative Mexican department of Bexar, 
for example, were in a state of semi-barbarism, 
shiftless and indolent, carrying on a rude agri- 
culture, adding nothing to the progress of the 
country, and really less civilized and prosper- 
ous than under the Spanish rule in the early 
part of the century. The moribund Mexican 
towns in the interior, with their mongrel pop- 
ulace whose worldly interests were sunk in the 
fandango and the cock-fight, were, industrially, 
beneath contempt. From the statistical report 
of the Mexican Inspector, Almonte, quoted in

some detail by Mr. Williams, it is manifest that 
the real root of the growth and prosperity of 
Texas was in the agricultural colonies (chiefly 
that of Austin) founded under land grants from 
the Mexican government to American empres- 
arios or contractors. And it is in these colo- 
nies that we are to look for the germs of the 
Anglo-American occupation of Texas, and of 
its final release from the titular sway of the 
Hispaiio-Mexicans. Defensible or not, the sep- 
aration was natural and inevitable. To argue 
that Mexico should have been left undisturbed 
in her purely nominal possession of a vast tract 
which she could neither occupy, govern, nor 
develop, and which, moreover, she had acquired 
by revolting from a government whose own title 
was founded in conquest, is to argue for a ten- 
derness of international conscience that has 
never been displayed in the world's history, 
and must have proved a fatal bar to the world's 
progress. If the title of the present occupants 
of Texas be primarily illegitimate and founded 
in theft (" public rapine," Mr. Smith calls it), 
then there is not a single humanly-inhabited 
square mile of the earth's surface in the hands 
of legitimate owners to-day. Mr. Bryce has 
noted the fact that England, while accustomed 
to judge her own national behavior by the act- 
ual standard, always applies the absolute stand- 
ard to other countries, " and particularly to 
America." She applied it to us very rigor- 
ously in this Texas matter. The reproach of 
" public rapine," however, coming from a pre- 
eminently grasping and meddling nation that 
has one hand on the throat of Ireland and the 
other in the pockets of India, and whose " morn- 
ing drum-beat" (thanks to her long arm and 
elastic conscience) " circles the earth with one 
continuous strain," is too hollow to rouse resent- 
ment. 

Owing to the political turmoils which fol- 
lowed the revolution from Spain in 1822 (about 
the time of the founding of Austin) the Amer- 
ican colonists were left for some years to their 
own devices. Mexico did nothing to protect 
or to govern her new settlers. Sturdy, honest, 
trained to habits of self-government and self- 
help, the best representatives of the hardy 
pioneers who have led the van of civilization 
across the American continent, they made their 
own laws, administered their own justice, and 
organized a militia for their own defence against 
the Indians and outlaws. The ground was 
cleared and planted ; land titles were duly re- 
corded ; cabins, schools, and churches were built; 
and by 1834 Brazos, the central department

which included the colony of Austin, was ex- 
porting yearly 5,000 bales of cotton and 50,- 
000 hides, at a total valuation of 1275,000, 
besides large droves of live-stock of which no 
estimate is given. We may state, by way of 
comparison, that at this time the total exports 
of the Mexican department of Brazos, with its 
ancient towns and long-settled country, con- 
sisted of a paltry total of some 8,000 to 10,- 
000 skins and furs. The Anglo-Saxon race 
were already writing their title to the soil of 
Texas on its surface, and in the records of its 
new growth and prosperity. To the honesty 
and hospitality of the colonists there is a com- 
mon testimony. Even Charles Hooten, a vitu- 
perative Englishman who wrote a book on 
Texas in 1840 and repaid his hosts by abusing 
them, admits that " it was a common custom to 
leave the doors unfastened when the house was 
empty, and that seldom or never was anything 
disturbed." Says our author : 

" No man took another man's note for a loan, the ver- 
bal promise of payment being considered sufficient, and 
all transactions of business were conducted on a fully 
warranted trust in the general integrity. Even those 
who had left the States on account of pecuniary failure 
or dishonesty came under the influence of the standard 
of honesty about them, and remitted the sums due to 
their distant creditors." 

Hospitality was an impulse rather than an 
obligation ; and the homely saying, " The latch- 
string hangs out," expressed then, as it does 
to-day, in Texas a fact of common life. The 
chance traveller who rode up to the cabin door 
was pressed to alight. The best that the rude 
economy of the border home afforded was at 
his disposal. The coffee-mill was set going, 
the hopper in the hollow log to grinding the 
corn, the venison or bear-meat was laid on the 
coals, the ashcake was baked, and after the 
meal and the evening chat the guest stretched 
himself on a buffalo-robe on the floor with the 
members of the family and slept the sleep of 
security and fatigue. In the morning, inquiry 
as to the charge was met with the reply, " You 
can pay me by coming again." There is even 
a tradition of an hospitable monomaniac who 
used to waylay travellers and force them, at 
the muzzle of a shot-gun, to visit him a hu- 
morous exaggeration, probably, of the general 
tendency. These agricultural colonists, the real 
founders of the Texan commonwealth, were a 
law-abiding people not only in respect of their 
own local laws, but of their conduct toward the 
general government, so long as that govern- 
ment preserved a remnant of legitimacy and 
fairness. In 1826, for instance, they sided 



with the Mexican authorities against their own 
countrymen in the entente called "the Fre- 
donian War." 

It was of course inevitable that the prosper- 
ity and the ominous increase of the American 
colonies should arouse the jealousy of the Mex- 
icans ; and it may be admitted that it was 
equally inevitable that the colonists, on their 
side, should feel growing aspirations toward in- 
dependence, and growing contempt for the 
weather-cock government at the capitol, that 
had become the prey of successive military 
adventurers. In 1830 they were driven to 
open revolt by the edicts of Bustamente, a 
sanguinary tyrant representing the centralist 
and anti-liberal party, who, among other abuses 
of his spurious authority, began preparations 
for Mexicanizing Texas by sending a thousand 
soldiers, mostly criminals and convicts, to sta- 
tions in the country. Bustamente was soon 
overthrown by the irrepressible Santa Anna, 
the stormy petrel of Mexican politics. But his 
system of oppression was continued by his suc- 
cessors ; and it culminated in the tyrannical 
decree of 1834, by which the Texan settlers 
were ordered to give up their arms about 
tantamount, under the prevailing conditions, 
to ordering them to give up their lives. To 
such a demand there could be but one reply. 
It was given in no equivocal terms ; and the 
issue between Mexico and her Anglo-American 
citizens was finally decided in favor of the lat- 
ter on the field of San Jacinto. That the flame 
of revolt was fanned from the first by uneasy 
spirits from over the border, men who, like the 
Bowies, Crockett, and Travis, had no wrongs 
to redress and no ends to serve but those of 
personal ambition or thirst for adventure, there 
is no doubt. As the trouble thickened, the fili- 
bustering element increased. The vastness of 
the prize at stake, an area of 268,684 square 
miles, with almost boundless territorial possi- 
bilities to the westward, made it impossible that 
the quarrel should be confined to its relatively 
insignificant principals. Sam Houston went 
to Texas late in 1832, ostensibly on a mission 
to the Comanche Indians. That he was really 
a secret emissary of President Jackson, charged 
with the duty of feeling the political pulse of 
the incensed colonists, is evident in the follow- 
ing letter to his chief written shortly after his 
arrival : 

"Having been as far as Bexar in the province of 
Texas, where I had an interview with the Comanche 
Indians, I am in possession of some information which 
will doubtless be interesting to you, and may be calcu- 
lated to forward your views, if you should entertain

any, touching the acquisition of Texas by the United 
States Government. That such a measure is desired 
by nineteen-twentieths of the population of the province, 
I cannot doubt. They are now without laws to govern 
or protect them. Mexico is involved in civil war. The 
Federal Constitution has never been in operation. The 
Government is essentially despotic, and must be so for 
years to come. The rulers have not honesty, and the 
people have not intelligence. The people of Texas are 
determined to form a state government, and unless 
Mexico is soon restored to order, and the Constitution 
revived and reenacted, the province of Texas will remain 
separate from the Confederacy of Mexico. She has 
already beaten and repelled all the troops of Mexico 
from her soil, nor will she permit them to return. Her 
want of money, taken in connection with the course 
Texas must and will adopt, will render the transfer of 
Texas to some power inevitable, and, if the United States 
does not press for it, England will most assuredly ob- 
tain it by some means. . . . England is pressing her 
suit for it, but its citizens will resist, if any transfer is 
made of them to any power but the United States. . . . 
My opinion is that Texas, by her members in conven- 
tion, will, by the first of April, declare all that country 
[east of the Rio Grande] as Texas proper, and form 
a State Constitution. I expect to be present at the 
Convention, and will apprise you of the course adopted 
as soon as the members have taken a final action. It is 
probable that I may make Texas my abiding-place. In 
adopting this course / will never forget the country of 
my birth. ..." 

The real object of Houston's mission to Texas 
did not long remain a secret. G. W. Feather- 
stonehaugh, an English traveller who came 
across him at the little village of Washington, 
notes in his book, " A Journey through the 
Slave States ": 

"General Houston was here, leading a mysterious 
sort of life, shut up in a small tavern, seeing nobody 
by day, and sitting up all night. The world gave him 
credit for passing his waking hours in the study of 
trente et quarante, and sept a lever, but I had been in 
communication with too many persons of late, and had 
seen too much passing before my eyes, to be ignorant 
that the little place was the rendezvous where a much 
deeper game than faro or rouge et noir was being played." 

Upon the rich fund of characteristic stories 
extant of Houston, our author has drawn lib- 
erally. Many of these turn upon his fondness 
for striking and histrionic effects, especially in 
the matter of costume. When elected Gov- 
ernor of Tennessee in 1827 the future Hero of 
San Jacinto appeared at the polls in a garb that 
would certainly call down popular vengeance 
upon the most " magnetic " modern candidate. 
He wore, says Col. Claiborne, 
41 A tall, bell-crowned, medium-brimmed, shining black 
beaver hat, shining black patent-leather stock or cravat, 
incased by a standing collar, ruffled shirt, black satin 
vest, shining black silk pants gathered to the waistband 
with legs full, same size from seat to ankle, and a gor- 
geous, red-ground, many-colored gown or Indian hunt- 
ing-shirt, fastened at the waist by a huge red sash cov- 
ered with fancy bead-work, with an immense silver 



buckle, embroidered silk stockings, and pumps with 
large silver buckles. Mounted on a superb dapple-gray 
horse he appeared at the election unannounced, and was 
the observed of all observers." 

As President of Texas, Houston is reported 
to have worn a sort of state robe of velvet, ex- 
changed, on minor occasions, for a " fancy vel- 
vet coat and trousers " plentifully trimmed with 
gold lace. He once presented himself to Sec- 
retary of War Calhoun in Washington in the 
garb of an Indian chief and was very prop- 
erly rebuked for the impropriety. The most 
striking description of Houston is that given 
by Oliver Dyer, who saw him in the Senate in 
1848. He was then fifty-five years of age: 

" He was a magnificent barbarian, somewhat tempered 
with civilization. He was large of frame, of stately car- 
riage and dignified demeanor, and had a lion-like coun- 
tenance, capable of expressing the fiercest passions. His 
dress was peculiar, but it was becoming to his style. 
The conspicuous features of it were a military cap and 
short military cloak of fine blue broadcloth with a blood- 
red lining. Afterward I occasionally met him when he 
wore a vast and picturesque sombrero and a Mexican 
blanket a sort of ornamental bed-quilt, with a slit in 
the middle, through which the wearer's head is thrust, 
leaving the blanket to hang in graceful folds around the 
body. . . . His principal employment in the Senate 
was whittling pine sticks. I used to wonder where he 
got his pine lumber, but never fathomed the mystery. 
He would sit and whittle away, and at the same time 
keep up a muttering of discontent at the long-winded 
speakers, whom he would sometimes curse for their in- 
tolerable verbosity. . . . General Houston impressed 
me as a lonely, melancholy man. And if the story of 
his early life was true he might well be lonely and mel- 
ancholy in spite of his success and his fame; for that 
blow which smote him to the heart at the zenith of his 
splendid young career, and dislocated his life and drove 
him into the wilderness, must have inflicted wounds that 
no political triumphs or military glory could heal." 

Mr. Williams's story of the Texan war, of 
the Alamo tragedy, the massacre at Goliad, 
and the fight at San Jacinto, is extremely spir- 
ited and graphic. We shall close our extracts 
with the following account of the capture of 
Santa Anna and his meeting with Houston 
after San Jacinto. 

" Houston had prophesied that Santa Anna would be 
found making his retreat on all fours, and in the dress 
of a common soldier. About two o'clock a little man 
was brought in behind a soldier on horseback. His 
restless eyes and pallid countenance indicated that he 
was suffering from great fear. He was dressed in linen 
trousers, a blue cotton jacket, a cap, and red worsted 
slippers. The Mexican soldiers, on seeing him, ex- 
claimed, ' El Presidente ! El General Santa Anna ! ' 
. Santa Anna was brought into the presence of 
Houston, who was lying on his pallet in a doze, having 
been kept awake during the night from the pain of his 
wound. Houston was not much more distinguished in 
dress than his captive. His dandyism had given way 
to the exigencies of the campaign, and he wore an old

black coat, a black velvet vest, a pair of snuff-colored 
pantaloons, and dilapidated boots. His only badge of 
authority during the campaign was a sword with a 
plated scabbard, which he tied to his belt with buck- 
skin thongs. Santa Anna stepped forward, and said, 
with an impressive bow, ' I am General Antonio Lopez 
de Santa Anna, President of the Mexican Republic, and 
I claim to be a prisoner of war at your disposal.' Hous- 
ton waved his hand for him to be seated on an ammuni- 
tion box, and Colonel Almonte was sent for to act as 
interpreter. While waiting his arrival, Santa Anna 
pressed his hands to his sides as if in pain or fear, and 
his restless black eyes glanced round the camp. When 
Almonte came up Santa Anna complained of pain, and 
asked for a piece of opium. A piece of about five 
grains was given him, and he regained something of 
his composure. His first words were, ' That man may 
consider himself born to no common destiny who has con- 
quered the Napoleon of the West. It now remains for 
him to be generous to the vanquished.' Houston replied, 
' You should have remembered that at the Alamo.' " 

It is almost with regret that one records that 
this inhuman butcher and born scoundrel, with 
his " Old Bailey countenance " and his worse 
than Old Bailey record, was shielded by Hous- 
ton from the fury of his captors. 

Mr. Williams has given us a useful book 
a good historical monograph, and a discrim- 
inating account of a public man whose memory 
has suffered about equally from fulsome eulogy

Manor," by Prof. Andrews, of Bryn Mawr Col- 
lege ; " The Agricultural Laborer," by Mr. 
Kebbel, which is but a reprint of the well- 
known and valuable edition of 1887 ; " The 
Condition of the Western Farmer," by Arthur 
F. Bentley ; and the " Economics of the Rus- 
sian Village," by Dr. T. A. Hourwich, Instruc- 
tor of Statistics at the University of Chicago. 

Dr. Andrews's work has a valuable Introduc- 
tion upon the conflicting theories of the origin 
of the Marc System. He neither accepts the 
theory of absolute democracy, with an elected 
chieftain among the Anglo-Saxon immigrants 
into Great Britain in the fifth century, nor 
does he accept the opposite theory of the com- 
munity being composed of a lord and his ten- 
ants, but takes a quite sensible position that 
the chieftainship was hereditary and the mass 
of the community were free, while there were 
also some slaves. The greater portion of the 
book is occupied in an interesting detailed 
study of the methods of land-holding, tillage, 
and home life of the Anglo-Saxon village as it 
was in the tenth century, a little before the 
Norman Conquest. The same conditions are 
held, however, to have continued almost un- 
changed for three or four centuries after the 
Conquest. Anyone interested in this subject 
will find the book an admirable guide, full of 
references to original authorities. 

The work of Mr. T. E. Kebbel, an English 
lawyer, has been accepted by all parties of En- 
gland, since the appearance of the first edition 
in 1870 and the second edition in 1887, as 
thoroughly reliable, but written from the Tory 
standpoint. Mr. Kebbel holds, and others 
generally admit, that compulsory education, 
when continued until the child is twelve or 
thirteen, has stimulated the ambition of the 
agricultural population to seek better opportu- 
nities or greater social pleasures in towns and 
cities, and has left the English farmer with 
only the unprogressive laborers. Thus, educa- 
tion has not apparently thus far been any help 
to the English farmer, while it has undoubt- 
edly elevated the laborer. Mr. Kebbel shows 
that English education, like much American, 
might serve a more valuable purpose if it had 
more of manual training and of relation to the 
work of after life. It appears that while wages 
have somewhat risen, yet four dollars a week 
and a cottage is about all an English laborer 
can secure for his work. But the earnings 
of his wife, and children over twelve, supple- 
ment this to a considerable degree. Wages, 
measured in purchasing power, are somewhat

higher than in 1870 ; yet the attempt of Mr. 
Arch to organize a trade-union of farm la- 
borers has broken down, and some of the rise 
in wages which he at one time helped to se- 
cure has disappeared. Drinking appears to 
be very common among the farm laborers and 
also among the farmers. Mr. Kebbel agrees 
with Prof. Marshall and many other English 
investigators, that for England large farms are 
probably better than small ones, but that the 
artificial restrictions that now exist on the pur- 
chase of small farms, because of the legal dif- 
ficulties of securing a title, should be removed. 
The general impression obtained from Mr. Keb- 
bel's book is of the extreme unprogressiveness 
of the English agricultural laborer as con- 
trasted with our own. 

" The Condition of the Western Farmer as 
illustrated by the Economic History of a Ne- 
braska Township " is a most valuable study of 
a typical Nebraska farming community in the 
central-eastern part of the state, where droughts 
have not been very great. The economic his- 
tory of every one of the nearly two hundred 
families that have owned farms since the set- 
tlement of the township, in 1872, has been 
carefully investigated and is here presented. 
It is shown that those who secured their land 
almost free from the Government are fairly 
prosperous, those that bought their land from 
the railroad (the Union Pacific) are less so, 
and those that bought their land from the first 
private owners are scarcely able to make a liv- 
ing ; and that, on the whole, it seems harder 
to get ahead now than it was years ago. With- 
out entering upon the possible relation of the 
money problem to the case, the author endeav- 
ors to present such local and at least partial 
causes as he finds. One cause is that early 
settlers could sell their crops at good prices to 
later settlers, while the latter were waiting for 
their own crops to grow. The early settlers 
could also sell at good prices to the workers 
who were constructing railroads through that 
part of the state. But now these demands 
have fallen off, and the crop must be sold in 
Chicago, in competition with many other lands, 
and after paying freight rates for long dis- 
tances. Then, too, the development of a set- 
tled community makes it unpopular and almost 
ignoble to live in the same kind of a dug-out 
and with the same lack of the somewhat ex- 
pensive comforts of civilization that the early 
isolated settlers endured. Finally, the knowl- 
edge of the changed conditions has not suffi- 
ciently reached the would-be settler of the East, 



who therefore pays more for land than the in- 
come from it will justify. Such studies as this 
by Mr. Bentley, who is a graduate student in. 
History and Political Science at Johns Hop- 
kins University, should be made in hundreds- 
of places throughout the entire country. 

Dr. Hourwich, a recent Fellow in Columbia 
College, and now placed in charge of the De- 
partment of Statistics in the University of Chi- 
cago, has in his work on " The Economics of 
the Russian Village " given us a careful study 
of the results of a series of official censuses of 
the industrial conditions of two districts con- 
sidered typical in middle Russia, directly in 
the neighborhood of the home of Leo TolstoiV 
about two hundred miles south of Moscow, and 
in the heart of the recent famine. The fact& 
quoted seem to show that instead of the Russian 
mir, or village, being able to preserve its systent 
of communal land-holding, as was fondly hoped 
by a large number of Russian writers, the mir 
is gradually changing into a village of individ- 
ual land-holders. The wage-system is fast de- 
veloping, and the small peasant holders who- 
succeeded the serfs have such poor methods of 
farming, and such wretched implements, that 
they are being gradually driven to the wall, as 
are the large land-holding nobles, by a new 
class of large land-holding capitalists. These 
latter are introducing improved ploughs, fertil- 
izers, etc., and give promise of ultimately dom- 
inating Russian agriculture, as has happened 
in England. This will increase the ability of 
Russia to compete with American agriculture. 
It is only on these growing capitalists' estates 
that the yield per acre to-day is equal to th& 
American. It would be helpful to the reader 
if Dr. Hourwich had not assumed quite as much 
knowledge as he does, on the part of his read- 
ers, of Russian economic terms or modes of in- 
dustrial activity, though it is not difficult in 
most cases to follow him. 

Professor Ashley, formerly of England and 
now of Harvard University, has given us th& 
continuation of his first volume on English Eco- 
nomic History, in a work much larger than the 
former. This new work, covering the End of 
the Middle Ages, together with Professor Cun- 
ningham's " Growth of English Industry and 
Commerce " and Mr. W. C. Taylor's " Mod- 
ern Factory System," correct a very optimistic 
view of the condition of the English Mediaeval 
workman given by Thorold Rogers. It is now 
considered very doubtful, certainly unproved, 
that any eight-hour work-day was general in 
England in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen-

turies. The idea that the acknowledged fall 
in the condition of the English workman in 
the sixteenth century cannot be traced to any 
distinct conspiracy of the landlord class, or of 
the king, has also met with a severe blow in 
these works. Professor Ashley shows that the 
confiscation of the revenues of the guilds did 
not seriously entrench upon such revenues as 
were set apart in the sixteenth century for the 
actual economic needs of the members, but re- 
lated almost entirely to funds devoted to relig- 
ious uses, and confiscation of the monastery 
funds somewhat hastened the need of a poor- 
law; but it is shown that in all cases, both Prot- 
estant and Catholic writers were becoming con- 
vinced that the monasteries, by their indiscrim- 
inate giving, pauperized quite as much as 
helped, and that state supervision was an im- 
provement over the monastery methods. This 
book of Professor Ashley's gives the best ac- 
count of the guilds, in the short compass of 
a hundred pages, that has thus far appeared. 
They are held, on the whole, to have been a 
very beneficial institution. This is also true 
of the considerable state activity that existed 
in the Middle Ages. It is probable that if the 
present tendency to form trusts and monopolies 
continues we shall find ourselves forced to in- 
troduce as much public supervision, if not of 
precisely the same kind, as was had in the Mid- 
dle Ages in all of Western Europe when the 
State controlled wages, prices, and the quality 
of goods, and even owned and managed flour- 
mills. 

"The Inheritance Tax," by Dr. Max West, 
is one of the best economic monographs that it 
has been the reviewer's good fortune to exam- 
ine for a long while. At this time, when the 
question of an inheritance tax is attracting so 
much favorable interest, and so many of our 
states are beginning to experiment with it, it 
is of great public advantage to have presented, 
in the clear way that Dr. West has done, a 
brief history and the present condition of the 
inheritance tax in all parts of Europe, Austral- 
asia, and the United States. This is followed 
by a discussion of the theory of the matter, and 
of the decisions of our courts, in the main up- 
holding the tax. The question is also consid- 
ered as to whether the tax should be progress- 
ive, increasing with the magnitude of the estate 
and with the distance of relationship of those 
inheriting. It may be said that Dr. West finds 
that experience in general has been favorable 
to the tax even in its progressive form, and that 
it is probable that in time many of our Amer- 



ican states will secure nearly, if not quite, their 
entire state revenue in this way, and that the 
national government also, as to some degree in 
the Civil War, will fall back upon it in time 
of crises, leaving to counties, townships, and 
cities revenue from licenses and the taxation of 
real-estate. 

Mr. James Bonar, already favorably known 
for his admirable little book on Malthus, has 
in his " Philosophy and Political Economy" 
shown the gradual development of philosoph- 
ical conceptions which have greatly influenced 
economic thought and activity. The goal now 
reached is that every one born into this world 
has the right to ask of society the opportunity 
for the harmonious development of all his pow- 
ers, while at the same time men will never sell 
their liberty to purchase a compulsory equality 
and fraternity. In More's " Utopia " is first 
discovered the demand for the improvement of 
the outward conditions, not of the few, but of 
all. Krause, the German philosopher of the 
first third of this century, is held to have first 
clearly taught that natural right is a claim for 
the conditions that make a rational human life 
possible. Very truly is it declared that the 
great work of socialism has been the emphasiz- 
ing of this idea, and the proof that the major 
portion of mankind do not now have, as they 
should, this opportunity of developing what is 
in them. Beginning with Plato and ending 
with Mill, Kant, Fichte, Krause, Hegel, and 
the socialists Marx, Engels, Lassalle, the wri- 
ter sketches the development of the economic 
view of history, and such theories as property, 
natural rights, and the functions of the state. 
This work, however, is in many places obscure, 
and not equal to the author's other writings. 

In his " Housing of the Poor," a prize essay 
of the American Economic Association, Mr. 
Reynolds gives a brief account of the leading 
efforts of philanthropists in London, New York, 
and Boston to build cheap yet good tenements 
for the poor. Plans of model tenements are 
given. The sanitary laws of New York, pro- 
nounced the best in England or America, are 
summarized ; but the author, in referring to 
the tendency of many of the poor to soon de- 
grade even the best tenements, does not seem 
appreciative of how efficient a remedy would 
lie in a well-enforced requirement that every 
tenement house containing over two tenements 
should have a responsible janitor to see to such 
matters. Just as in Boston no clothing can be 
made in a tenement without a license, which is 
given only on proof of excellent sanitary con-

ditions, so there might be required a similar 
license for residence. On the whole, however, 
the monograph is a valuable study of the im- 
portant subject treated. 

In his " Introduction to the Study of the De- 
pendent, Defective, and Delinquent Classes," 
Dr. Charles R. Henderson, of the Sociological 
Department of the University of Chicago, pre- 
sents a carefully chosen summary of the diverse 
opinions of scientific writers upon the causes, 
nature, and remedies of pauperism, insanity, 
crime, and affiliated evils. The topical method 
of presentation, and the full lists of authori- 
ties on every point, joined to brief comments 
by the writer, will make the book useful for 
students as all should be of these social 
problems. 

In " The New Reformation," Mr. Ramsden 
Balmforth, from somewhat the standpoint of 
our ethical culture societies, makes a strong 
appeal to us to follow out the ideas of Carlyle, 
Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold, and find our 
highest duty in securing juster and more equal 
opportunities for true living to the humanity 
about us. Whatever one may think of the au- 
thor's views of orthodox Christianity, everyone 
must admit the supreme duty and need, too 
often as yet unrealized, of securing far greater 
justice and humanity in social conditions. 

It is an interesting evidence of the position 
fast being taken by the new University of Chi- 
cago, that of the ten writers in economic and 
social science whose works are included in this 
review, three Messrs. Hourwich, Henderson, 
and West are now connected with this Uni- 
versity. EDWARD W. BEMIS. 



: A CHARACTER STUDY.* 



No man more sincerely than Abraham Lin- 
coln would have chosen for a biographer one 
who would " nothing extenuate, nor set down 
aught in malice." Yet it has not been his good- 
fortune hitherto to find such a relator of his 
life. Whilst he has escaped in a large degree 
malicious misrepresentation, he has in the main 
fallen into the hands of men lacking the his- 
torical faculty, who have followed along the 
lines of the " campaign " life. The most am- 
bitious of these biographies Hay and Nico- 
lay's, while full of valuable material, does not 
commend itself to the judgment of the histo-

umes. " American Statesmen " series. Boston: Houghton,

rian as a true picture of the greatest American. 
The state of mind of its makers is many times 
as much like that of the famous Mason Weems 
as can be possible to any mind in the nine- 
teenth century. It has been reserved for Mr. 
John T. Morse to write the first serious esti- 
mate of the life and character of Lincoln ; for 
whilst he has not made the ideal book which 
we all look for but never see, he has grasped 
the personality of one of the most individual 
men of any age. Mr. Morse sets forth in a 
masterly manner the unique combination of 
characteristics, so well known and yet so little 
understood. 

Nowhere does Mr. Morse show his phil- 
osophic insight better than where he character- 
izes as " the preeminently striking feature in 
Lincoln's nature," " the extraordinary degree 
to which he always appeared to be in close and 
sympathetic touch with the people, that is to say 
the people in the mass wherein he was im- 
bedded, the social body amid which he dwelt, 
which pressed upon him on all sides, which 
for him formed ' the public.' " And he adds : 

" The very quality which made Lincoln, as a young 
man, not much superior to his coarse surroundings, was 
precisely the same quality which, ripening and expand- 
ing rapidly and grandly with maturing years and a 
greater circle of humanity, made him what he was in 
later life. It is through this quality that we get con- 
tinuity in him; without it, we cannot evade the insolu- 
ble problem of two men two lives one following the 
other with no visible link of connection between them; 
without it we have physically one creature, morally and 
mentally two beings. If we reject this trait, we throw 
away the only key which unlocks the problem of the 
most singular life, taken from end to end, which has 
ever been witnessed among men, a life which many have 
been content to regard as an unsolved enigma." 

Speaking of the constitutional tendency to 
gloom which afflicted Lincoln through life, the 
author suggests a partial explanation of it when 
he says : 

" It is well known that the coarse and rough side of 
life among the pioneers had its reaction in a reserved and 
at times morose habit, nearly akin to sadness, at least 
in those who frequented the wilderness; it was the ex- 
pression of the influence of the vast, desolate, and lonely 
nature amid which they passed their lives. The shud- 
dering awe and terrible sense of fate, which the grandeur 
of the Greek tragedies so powerfully expresses, come to 
us when we contemplate this strange cloud which never 
left Lincoln in any year after his earliest youth, although 
some traits in his character seemed often incomprehen- 
sibly to violate it, and, like rebellious spirits, to do out- 
rage to it, while in fact they only made it the more 
striking, picturesque, and mysterious." 

In another fine passage in volume one we 
have a diagnosis of that remarkable lack of 
animosity in Lincoln's nature which makes pos- 



264

[Nov. 1,. 



sible the statement that although, in the dis- 
cussion of slavery, "he was dealing with a 
question which was arousing personal antag- 
onisms as bitter as any that history records, 
yet he never condemned anyone, nor ever passed 
judgment against his fellow-men." The author 
believes this a mental rather than a moral 
trait, and finds its root " not so much in human 
charity as in fairness of thinking." In any 
event it marked him as the one man of large 
magnanimity who, as a civilian, bore a con- 
spicuous part in the Rebellion period. It lifted 
him above the bickerings of party strife, and 
enabled him to live calmly and serenely in the 
daily presence of men of such virulent animos- 
ities as Edwin M. Stanton, and finally to sway 
all to his own unselfish purposes. 

For another trait, equally conspicuous amid 
those stormy days from 1850 to 1865, was " his 
entire political unselfishness, the rarest moral 
quality among men in public life." Out of a 
time when selfish ambitions and place-seeking 
and intrigue were too common for us to con- 
template contentedly, and when slanders and 
cruel aspersions were the lot of many who tried 
to do their duty, the reputation of this man has 
come as of one who rose above every unworthy 
ambition and every personal meanness to the 
one thought that filled his four years of office : 
that the Nation was a trust in his hands, to be 
saved from its enemies, even sometimes in spite 
of the step-motherly efforts of its friends. 

" Not the faintest shadow of self ever fell for an in- 
stant across this simple purpose. He was intent to play 
his part out faithfully, with all the ability he could 
bring to it; but anyone else who could might win and 
wear the title of savior. He chiefly cared that the 
saving should be done. Never once did he manipulate 
any court magnet to draw toward himself the credit or 
the glory of a measure or a move. To his own future 
he seemed to give no thought." 

This magnanimity was not only conspicuous 
as regarded himself : it was manifested in all 
his utterances of a personal nature. The au- 
thor emphasizes the fact that seldom if ever in 
his public career did he utter criticism of any 
man's character or motives. No man stands in 
the pages of history stained by his aspersions 
or even pilloried by his just denunciations. Not 
even when one like McClellan, writhing under 
a sense of abandonment in the crisis of his 
campaign, denounced him bitterly to his face, 
did he strike back. He seemed to take hold 
on the part of each man's conduct which ap- 
proached nearest to his own patriotic endeavor, 
and to put out of sight forever all that savored 
of the earthy. Consequently he gathered out 



of the great seething mass of mixed motives 
that surrounded him all that was worthiest and 
noblest, and concentred it for the salvation of 
the nation. Regardless of what a man's per- 
sonal abuse of himself had been as in the case 
of Stanton he took cordially every true effort 
that came to him, and built it into the one con- 
trolling purpose. 

We have confined our review to that portion 
of Mr. Morse's work which deals with Lin- 
coln's personality, because we believe that this 
is its distinct contribution to the literature of 
the theme. Yet as much space might have 
been given to the admirable treatment of some 
of the historic controversies of the War period. 
Mr. Lincoln's justification in the matter of 
Fort Sumter is well set out. The McClellan 
imbroglio is handled with clear discrimination, 
which recognizes the many abilities of that ill- 
starred general, while making manifest his one 
fatal weakness. The difficult subject of Re- 
construction is discussed with a calm display of 
the pros and cons of Mr. Lincoln's policy, 
which leaves one more than ever convinced 
that only his large heart and clear brain could 
have carried out such a policy. 

It seems ungracious to say anything in way 
of censure of so meritorious a work, but there 
are errors of expression which mar somewhat 
a very welcome narrative. To score a point 
in favor of General Grant's modesty, it was 
not necessary to impute to his predecessors 
" generally " words used only by one of them. 
The narrative does not gain vividness by call- 
ing Horace Greeley " woolly-witted." There is 
a small pedantry which surprises us in so phil- 
osophic a historian, in more than once correct- 
ing Mr. Lincoln's "would" to," [should]." 
This is an indignity which will not help the 
cause of correct grammar. There is a pecul- 
iar atrocity in dressing out once more the dis- 
carded petticoat-story about Mr. Davis for the 
purpose of suggesting that by his tragic death 
" Mr. Lincoln was robbed of the amusement 
which he would have gathered from this ex- 
ploit." Such cheap wit in the presence of the 
mighty dead should be expunged from a later 



edition.

RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY.* 



The dainty little volumes into which Mr. Gilder 
is wont to collect his poems have long been favor- 
ites with the book-lover. There are five of them 
now, and " The Great Remembrance " is by no 
means the least of the five, although its contents 
are chiefly poems of persons and occasions. The 
title poem is certainly one of the best commemorat- 
ive pieces that the inspiration of the Civil War has 
evoked. "So long ago it was," and yet the mem- 
ory of it can still impel to such verse as this : 

" So long ago it was, so long ago, 
All, all have passed ; the terror and the splendor 
Have turned like yesterevening's stormy glow 
Into a sunset memory strange and tender. 
How beautiful it seems, what lordly sights, 
What deeds sublime, what wondrous days and nights, 
What love of comrades, ay, what quickened breath, 
When first we knew that, startled, quailing, still 
We too, even we, along the blazing hill 
We, with the best, could face and conquer death." 

'There is a touch of Lowell in this fine passage: 

" Dear Country ! Thou 
Art still our passion ; still to thee we bow 
In love supreme ! Fairer than e'er before 
Art thou to-day from golden shore to shore 
The home of freemen. Not one stain doth cling 
Now to thy banner. Argosies of war 
On thy imperial rivers bravely fling 
Flags of the nations, but no message bring 
Save of peace only ; while, behold, from far 
The Old World comes to greet thy natal star 
That with the circling century returns, 
And in the Western heavens with fourfold beauty burns." 

Lowell himself is the subject of one of Mr. Gilder's 
heartfelt personal tributes.

Whose pines, and prairies, and people, and teeming soil, 
Where was shaken of old the seed of the freedom of men,

Thou didst love as a strong man loveth the maiden he woos, 

Not the woman he toys with, and sings to, and, passing, for- 
gets, 

Whom he woos, whom he wins, whom he weds, his passion, 
his pride, 

Who no shadow of wrong shall suffer, who shall stand in his 
sight 

Pure as the sky of the evil her foeman may threat, 

Save by word or by thought of her own in her whiteness un- 
touched, 

And wounded alone of the lightning her spirit engenders." 

Few writers have Mr. Gilder's power to seize the 
poetry of the mood or of the passing moment, and 
to fix it with unpremeditated art. His verse-forms 
are often wayward ; their spontaneity must be the 
excuse for their license. Another marked charac- 
teristic is his command of the imagery of the skies, 
recalling Shelley in its pervasive quality and haunt- 
ing effect. How exquisitely he can use such imagery 
may be shown by the lines to " Evening in Tyring- 
ham Valley." 

" What domes and pinnacles of mist and fire 

Are builded in yon spacious realms of light 
All silently, as did the walls aspire 

Templing the ark of God by day and night. 
Noiseless and swift, from darkening ridge to ridge, 

Through purple air that deepens down the day, 
Over the valley springs a shadowy bridge. 

The evening star's keen, solitary ray 
Makes more intense the silence, and the glad, 

Unmelancholy, restful, twilight gloom, 
So full of tenderness, that even the sad 

Remembrances that haunt the soul take bloom 
Like that on yonder mountain. 

Now the bars 

Of sunset all burn black ; the day doth fail, 
And the skies whiten with the eternal stars. 

Oh, let thy spirit stay with me, sweet vale ! " 

This volume contains also Mr. Gilder's three poems 
suggested by the Columbian Exposition, one of the 
three, as our readers will remember, having made 
its first appearance in THE DIAL, and another of 
them having been included in its recent World's 
Fair symposium. 

" For Fifty Years " Dr. Edward Everett Hale 
has been writing occasional verses, and some of his 
friends have recently insisted upon having the scat- 
tered pieces collected and printed. Dr. Hale pro- 
vides the title-page with an appropriate motto from 
the " Memoir of Frederic Ingham ": " If it were 
his duty to write verses, he wrote verses ; to fight 
slavers, he fought slavers ; to write sermons, he 
wrote sermons ; and he did one of these things with 
just as much alacrity as another." We have no 
doubt that Dr. Hale's verses were written with 
" alacrity "; they are sparks struck from a much 
belabored anvil, and, like his sermons, histories, and 
novels, reveal the warm-hearted and forceful person- 
ality of their writer. There are some rough and spir- 
ited ballads (which turn out to be pointed anecdotes 
told in rugged rhyme), groups of college and war 
pieces, a few translations, some versified conclusions 
of sermons (following, we are told, the excellent ex- 
ample of Dr. Doddridge), and a miscellaneous sec- 
tion. Dr. Hale quotes a Spanish proverb to the 
effect that " Every one who is not a fool has writ- 



266 



[Nov. 1, 



ten two sonnets," and to prove (quite unnecessarily) 
that he is not a fool, he gives us three, one of which 
we reproduce as a characteristic specimen of his 
work. Its subject is " the ship which brought a 
copy of Michael Angelo's statue of Christ from 
Italy to America." 

" Bark after bark has sunk in gales like these, 
Facing the jealous West, as thou dost now. 
Still thou must breast each wave, nor shun the seas, 
Which beetle downward on thy westward prow. 
The great ' Christ-bearer ' quailed not : he, as thou, 
Left Italy to seek our Western shore ; 
And as another dove another olive bore, 
Seeing across the waste another promise-bow. 
Beat westward still ! beat downward every wave ! 
The Christ who gave our New World to the Old, 
E'en then his secret to his Michael told, 
And to his eye the sacred vision gave. 
Beat the waves down ! let them his form behold 
Who are his ' other sheep,' not of his early fold." 

Three of these verses have superfluous feet, but Dr. 
Hale does not mind a little thing like that, and his 
countless friends and well-wishers would forgive far 
more serious offences. 

Miss Guiney's new volume of poems is thin only 
as a matter of physical measurement. In quality 
it is compact and exquisite, while imitative in but 
slight degree. Its originality is sometimes gained 
at the cost of a forced verbalism, and its compres- 
sion sometimes results in obscurity ; but we may well 
put up with a few imperfections in verse that is so 
much more than a mere echo. The author's qual- 
ities (and their defects ) are well illustrated in " The 
Kings": 

"A man said unto his angel : 

' My spirits are fallen thro', 

And I cannot carry this battle ; 

brother ! what shall I do ? 

' ' The terrible Kings are on me, 
With spears that are deadly bright, 
Against me so from the cradle 
Do fate and my fathers fight.' 

" Then said to the man his angel : 
' Thou wavering, foolish soul, 

Back to the ranks ! What matter 

To win or to lose the whole, 

"As judged by the little judges 
Who hearken not well, nor see ? 
Not thus, by the outer issue, 
The Wise shall interpret thee. 

' ' Thy will is the very, the only, 
The solemn event of things ; 
The weakest of hearts defying 
Is stronger than all these Kings. 

"Tho' out of the past they gather 
Mind's Doubt and Bodily Pain, 
And pallid Thirst of the Spirit 
That is kin to the other twain, 

And Grief, in a cloud of banners, 
And ringletted Vain Desires, 
And Vice, with the spoils upon him 
Of thee and thy beaten sires, 

' ' While kings of eternal evil 
Yet darken the hills about, 
Thy part is with broken sabre 
To rise on the last redoubt ; 



' ' To fear not sensible failure, 
Nor covet the game at all, 
But fighting, fighting, fighting, 
Die, driven against the wall ! ' " 

A comparison of this poem with Arnold's " The- 
Last Word," not unlike it in theme, or even with 
Sill's " Opportunity," will show that it loses some- 
thing by such phrases as " the outer issue," " sen- 
sible failure," and 

" The very, the only, 
The solemn event of things," 

and something more, possibly, by over-elaboration 
of the allegory; but it remains an impressive piece 
of work. Miss Guiney's remarkable lyrical faculty 
may be illustrated from the verses to " Hylas ": 

" Fathoms low, the naiads sing 

In a birthday welcoming ; 

Water-white their breasts, and o'er him 

Water-gray, their eyes adore him. 

( There's a bird on the under bough 

Fluting evermore and now : 
' Keep young ! ' but who knows how ? ) " 

or by these from " The Still of the Year ": 

"Sweet is cherry-time, sweet 
A shower, a bobolink, 
And the little trillium-blossom 
Tucked under her leaf to think ; 
But here in the vast unborn 
Is the bitterest place to be, 
Till striving and longing 
Shall quicken the earth and me. 
What change inscrutable 
Is nigh us, we know not well ; 
Gone is the strength to sigh, 
Either to live or die. 
Heigho ! my heart's sick." 

Miss Guiney's sonnets are as I'emarkable as her lyr- 
ics and ballads. Here is the beautiful close of the- 
sonnet upon an old Italian Madonna : 

" As up a wayside, after rain, 
When the blown beeches purple all the height 
And clouds sink to the sea-marge, suddenly 
The autumn sun (how soft, how solemn-bright ! ) 
Moves to the vacant dial, so is lain 
God's meaning Hand, thou chosen, upon thee." 

This simile might be matched (if there were any 
use in matching things ) with some of the finer sim- 
iles in Bossetti ; and the group of London sonnets, 
in their revelation of the poetic aspects of the Great 
City, with Mr. Henley's recent verses upon that 
perilous theme. Here is a picture of London by 
gaslight : 

" Full as a marsh of mist and winking light ; 
Heaven thickens over, Heaven that cannot cure 
Her tear by day, her fevered smile by night." 

Even a London fog has its poetry ( as Mr. Henley 
also discovered): 

" Like bodiless water passing in a sigh, 
Thro' palsied streets the fatal shadows flow, 
And in their sharp disastrous undertow 
Suck in the morning sun, and all the sky." 

Miss Guiney's work tempts to quotation, but one 
more example must suffice the stanzas to the mem- 
ory of Dr. Parsons : 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



267 



" Friend who hast gone, and dost enrich to-day 
New England brightly building far away, 
And crown her liberal walk 
With company more choice, and sweeter talk, 

" Look not on Fame, but Peace ; and in a bower 
Receive at last her fulness and her power : 
Nor wholly, pure of heart, 
Forget thy few, who would be where thou art." 

So graceful and touching a tribute is not often paid 
to the illustrious dead. 

Mrs. Sangster's verses are of the unpretentious, 
old-fashioned, homely sort, smooth in measure and 
wholesome in sentiment, mostly written in sincerely 
pious vein. A couple of stanzas from " The Annun- 
ciation" are fairly representative. 

" With grave eyes rapt in dreams of prayer, 

She sits alone within the room, 
Unheeding if around her there 

Be golden ray or deepening gloom. 
Her heart uplifted, silent, sweet, 
Her thought goes forth her Lord to greet. 

" And thus attent before the King, 

No sense of strangeness startles her 
When one from heaven draws near to bring 

A sign to Heaven's worshipper. 
' Hail, Mary ! ' fills her soul with bliss, 
Her tranquil years have waited this." 

The verses in this volume have all been collected 
from various periodicals. 

Madame Darmesteter's new volume affords 
glimpses of a life varied in experience, both object- 
ive and subjective, of a mind that has borne the 
full stress of modern thought, and of a heart that, 
unchanged by new appeals, still recurs to the famil- 
iar themes endeared by early association. There 
are lyrics and ballads and sonnets ; lyrics with a 
touch of melancholy, ballads of terse dramatic force, 
and sonnets of the life of culture and intellectual 
preoccupation. The verses on u Le Roc-du-Chere," 
where Taine is buried, and the other verses bearing 
" Veritatem Dilexi" Kenan's motto for a title, 
pay rich and merited tribute to the two men whose 
recent death has left the world so poor. We quote 
the former piece : 

" High on the heathery hill-brow o'er the lake, 
White as a temple gleams the tomb afar. 
Shine on, shine on even as a guiding star, 
And let our souls be nobler for thy sake. 

"He whom we leave amid the rocks and winds 
Tower'd in our midst, a conscience to us all. 
We look'd at him and fought, and dared not fall, 
But faced the truth in front with honest minds. 

" passionate and loyal Spirit of Life 

That spake so true and firm thro' doubt and pain. 
large and grand and simple soul of Taine, 
Be to us still our standard in the strife ; 

" Pure as the welling waters of thy wave, 
And mighty as the mountains of thy rest, 
Indomitable as yonder eagled crest, 
And lowly as these grasses round thy grave." 

The beautiful sonnet called " Spring and Autumn " 
well illustrates the tender grace of Madame Dar- 
mesteter's best work: 



" God in His heart made Autumn for the young ; 

That they might learn to accept the approach of age 

In golden woods and starry saxifrage 
And valleys all with azure mists o'erhung. 
For over Death a radiant veil He flung, 

That the inevitable heritage 

Might come revealed in beauty, and assuage 
The dread with which the heart of youth is wrung. 
And for the consolation of the old 

He made the delicate, swift, tumultuous Spring ; 
That every year they might again behold 

The image of their youth in everything, 
And bless the fruit-trees flowering in the cold, 

Whose harvest is not for their gathering." 

Mr. Rawnsley's " Valete " is a volume of per* 
sonal poems (mostly obituary) to the number of more 
than one hundred. The distinguished dead among 
Englishmen of the last twenty years have supplied 
the author with most of his subjects, and his verses 
are grouped under such heads as " The Royal Dead," 
" Shepherds of Men," and " Singers among Men." 
Tennyson alone has upwards of a score of these 
tributes of song. Mr. Rawnsley is the son of the 
Vicar of Shiplake, by whom Tennyson was, on June 
13, 1850, united in marriage to Miss Sellwood, and 
to this fact the writer gracefully refers in the most 
ambitious of his tributes to his old friend: 

" Or leaving Thames I seek by chalky dell 
My father's terrace-garden o'er the flood, 
Where once a bride and bridegroom-poet stood, 
And heard in June-tide air the marriage bell 
Ring thro' the walnuts that ' the hour is good 
When noble man weds noblest woman-hood.' " 

The sonnet on " The Poet's Death-Chamber "(de- 
serves quotation. 

"Not in the bright, unsolitary noon, 

When all the air with life and music rings, 
Came the great hush of those archangel wings, 
That gave the singer peace and endless boon ; 
But rather at the midnight hour of swoon 
When Sleep, Death's prophet, unto Nature brings 
Surcease of sense and outward communings 
Beneath that world of loneliness, the moon. 
And so he grew to marble he who made 
In hearts of stone the generous life-blood run, 

But o'er him dead, Death's planet wheeling slow 
Flung down such splendour through the awful shade, 
As made us feel his soul was with the Sun 
And needed Death to give us back the glow." 

A number of Mr. Rawnsley's tributes are paid to 
our own countrymen, among them Whitman, Lowell, 
Whittier, and Bishop Brooks. We select the son- 
net inscribed to our beloved Quaker poet: 

"We shall not see again the deep-set eyes, 

Tight mouth, thought-furrows on the friendly face 
That never disavowed the Quaker race. 
His shock of years is garnered under skies 
Well known, well sung of, for his soul was wise 
With all the change of season, and the grace 
Of Nature, stored afield in lonely place 
To melt the labourer's heart with melodies. 
His voice was clear because he saw the truth, 
The simple truth that God would have men free. 

On furrows red with war his seed was sown ; 
And loving right and hating tyranny, 
He fashioned for a nation in its youth 

Such music as its age shall not disown." 

These sonnets are typical examples of Mr. Rawns- 



268 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



ley's work, which, although sinking occasionally 
into commonplace, maintains, as a whole, an even 
excellence. Although it rarely thrills, it rarely 
fails to please, and the note of its sympathy never 
seems forced. 

In his verses on " The Public and the Poet," Mr. 
James Rhoades remarks : 

" Time was when a poet was deemed rara avis; 
Now they babble on bough like the merle or the mavis. 
One or two in a lifetime was all very well ; 
But who's to keep pace when some sixty break shell ? " 

Who, indeed ? will echo the reviewer to whom come 
yearly two or three score volumes of minor verse. 
The general public, in happier ignorance of the 
gravity of the problem, may think of its old favor- 
ites and smile ; but the reader who keeps closely 
cognizant of the current Muse cannot refrain from 
a half-formulated fear lest a considerable amount 
of good work be swamped by the swelling flood 
poured forth by mediocrity. Mr. Rhoades, like 
most of the other versifiers discussed in this article, 
is a facile writer, and produces work very credita- 
ble in form, and freighted with enough of thought 
to interest and to please. His one-act tragedy, 
" Teresa," has composition and dramatic force ; his 
songs and sonnets and translations display good 
taste and serious feeling. Sometimes, as in this son- 
net on "Norman Ndruda," he rises to a real height : 
"She stood with lifted bow in act to sweep 
The strings : sound flashed ; the silent air caught fire ; 
And, wave on wave upsurging high and higher, 
The waters of our soul one stormy heap 
Hung menacing. Anon she bade them sleep. 
She woke the winds of Memory : dead desire 
Revived ; hope grappled with the eternal liar ; 
Love saw the end, and deemed the forfeit cheap. 
She pierced the bounds of Being : with one breath 
Of that prevailing strain she fell on fate 
And slew it ; back swung the adamantine gate, 
Self-opening ; there was no more time or death. 
And then she ceased. And oh, how steep the fall 
From heaven to that dark, disenchanted hall ! " 

We commend also the verses to Gordon, and some 
other pieces of a memorial character. 

Quod scripsi scripsi is the motto upon the title- 
page of Sir John Croker Barrow's poems. The 
critic admits the fact, but wonders why. The au- 
thor's Pegasus seems to be but a sorry nag, and 
shows no sign of wings. 

"Some million star-worlds, it is said, 
Are whirling round us overhead ; 
And maybe there are millions more 
For future ages to explore." 

This stanza illustrates the jog-trot of the noble 
writer's verse. When he will be philosophical, his 
discourse is after this prosaic fashion : 

" She, though she breathes no word of ' Woman's Right,' 
Yet looks on Man as her inferior, 
And woe to him who rashly marries her ! 
For he must either slave by day or night, 
Or else for liberty must firmly fight ; 
And lastly, whether he be conqueror 
Or conquered, must in either case incur 
The grave misfortune of a marriage blight." 

Is Woman in general the subject of this atrocious 



utterance? And if so, where, oh where, are the 
avenging Thracian maidens ? We are all the more 
disposed to be frank in expressing an opinion of 
this volume, because its author distinctly hints that 
he is prepared for the worst. This is his envoy : 

" Farewell, awhile, dear offspring of my mind ! 

On trial ye must pass through prison Press, 
Before tribunal of a world not kind, 

Nor caring whether critics curse or bless. 
Farewell ! Should rash reviewers shed your blood, 

Weep not ! your tears will not be understood." 

We trust that verse like this will never be born into 
any other than " a world not kind." 

For many years Mrs. Augusta Webster has oc- 
cupied a more than respectable rank among the 
minor poets of contemporary England. She has 
published in the neighborhood of a dozen volumes, 
including some remarkable translations from JEs- 
chylus and Euripides. But 110 minor poet can ex- 
pect to live ( except for the memory of his friends) 
in a dozen volumes ; most are fortunate if they are 
preserved in the anthologies. Yet the high excel- 
lence of Mrs. Webster's verse is at least such as to 
justify the volume of " Selections " from her writ- 
ings which has just appeared, and which contains 
examples of her best narrative and lyrical styles, as 
well as a number of the dramatic monologues for 
which her genius seems peculiarly fitted. These 
monologues suggest the similar work of both Brown- 
ing and Tennyson ; of the former by their force 
and penetration, of the latter by their grace and 
finish. A fair example of Mrs. Webster's lyrics is 
the following " Song," which is neither better nor 
worse -than fifty others : 

" Dear love, good-night. And, tender sleep, 

Seal up her lids like these drowsed flowers, 
To make day fair when they unclose. 
Be hushed around her, Night, and keep 
Thy silent guard on her repose ; 
But speed thine hours. 

" Dear love, sleep on. This weary space 

I wake and long for day and thee, 
And count the slow stars from their west. 
Sleep while I hunger for thy face, 
Sleep, dearest, in unbroken rest ; 
But dream of me." 

Mrs. Webster's strictly dramatic work is unrepre- 
sented in this selection. 

The new volume of poems by Professor Roberts 
includes his ode for the Shelley Centenary (reviewed 
by us at the time of its separate appearance), a 
series of sonnets " dealing with aspects of common 
outdoor life " (some of these reprinted from " In 
Divers Tones"), and a number of new ballads and 
lyrics. Once only, but once too often, the author 
has attempted the form of dialect humor, and the 
piece strikes the one discordant note of the collec- 
tion. We like very much the verses on " Canadian 
Streams ": 

"St. Lawrence, whose wide water laves 
The shores that ne'er have nourished slaves ! 

Swift Richelieu of lilied fame ! 
Niagara of glorious graves.

" Dread Saguenay, where eagles soar, 
What voice shall from the bastioned shore 

The tale of Roberval reveal. 
Or his mysterious fate deplore ? 

" And thou far tide whose plains now beat 
With march of myriad westering feet, 

Saskatchewan, whose virgin sod 
So late Canadian blood made sweet." 

This has the true patriotic ring, always a distinctive 
element in the author's work. The following son- 
net on " The Deserted City " is a beautiful occi- 
dental echo of the passion of Dante, when he took 
for his text Quomodo sedet sola civitas! 

" There lies a little city leagues away. 

Its wharves the green sea washes all day long. 

Its busy, sun-bright wharves with sailors' song 
And clamour of trade ring loud the live-long day. 
Into the happy harbour hastening, gay 

With press of snowy canvas, tall ships throng. 

The peopled streets to blithe-eyed Peace belong, 
Glad-housed beneath these crowding roofs of grey. 
'T was long ago this city prospered so, 

For yesterday a woman died therein. 
Since when the wharves are fallen idle, I know, 

And in the streets is hushed the pleasant din ; 

The thronging ships have been, the songs have been ; 
Since yesterday it is so long ago." 

Mr. Campbell's verses are characterized by an 
imaginative grasp of nature, and especially of na- 
ture in her sadder or sterner moods, that is often 
singularly impressive. The approach of winter, the 
sweep of the storm, and the majesty of the ice- 
bound northern wastes, are themes to which the au- 
thor frequently recurs, and which he continues to 
associate with the corresponding phases of human 
emotion. This interpenetration of the soul of man 
and the soul of the physical world may be taken as 
the predominant thought of Mr. Campbell's work. 
When in quiet vein, he gives us tender verses like 
these from " An August Reverie ": 

" The ragged daisy starring all the fields, 

The buttercup abrim with pallid gold, 
The thistle and burr-flowers hedged with prickly shields, 

All common weeds the draggled pastures hold, 
With shrivelled pods and leaves, are kin to me, 
Like-heirs of earth and her maturity. 

"They speak a silent speech that is their own, 
These wise and gentle teachers of the grass ; 

And when their brief and common days are flown, 
A certain beauty from the year doth pass : 

A beauty of whose light no eye can tell, 

Save that it went ; and my heart knew it well." 

A deeper melancholy breathes from the stanzas to 
" Autumn," which cannot fail to suggest the great 
ode of Keats. 

" On silent nights, grey mists creep near the ground, 

And airs are keen and stars grow sharp and clear, 
And phantom frosts steal in and make no sound 
Down the long, haunted river, bleak and drear, 
Biting with death the sedges dank and sere, 
And ever the wan moon rises large and round 
Over the woodlands, flooding with iced dream 
The far-hushed, ghostly face of wood and field and stream." 

Another manner, one of infrequent occurrence, is 
illustrated by the stanzas entitled " Love ": 



" Love came at dawn when all the world was fair, 

When crimson glories, bloom, and song were rife ; 
Love came at dawn when hope's wings fanned the air, 
And murmured, ' I am life.' 

" Love came at even when the day was done, 

When heart and brain were tired, and slumber pressed ; 
Love came at eve, shut out the sinking sun, 
And whispered, ' I am rest.' " 

A tribute to Robert Browning is one of the note- 
worthy poems of the collection. Mr. Campbell's 
chief defects are an occasional diffuseness, a use of 
awkward inversions, and a certain waywardness in 
his attitude toward the laws of rhythmical structure. 
These notes upon the Canadian singers of to-day 
may appropriately be closed by a few words about 
the volume of " Later Canadian Poems " which Mr. 
Wetherell has edited. It includes selections from 
the two writers above mentioned, as well as from 
Mr. Bliss Carman, Mr. G. F. Cameron, Mr. Archi- 
bald Lampman, Mr. D. C. Scott, Mr. F. G. Scott, 
and half a dozen Canadian women. All the poems 
have been published within the last dozen years. 
Excellent portraits are given of the seven men 
whose work makes up the bulk of the collection. 
Mr. Carman, we regret to say, is not represented 
by the poem which is by far his best his elegy on 
the death of Matthew Arnold ; and " The Isles " 
should certainly have been given among the selec- 
tions from Professor Roberts. The book, as a 
whole, makes an excellent impression ; it seems to 
mark the rise of a distinctive school of Canadian 
song, having for its leading motive the faithful in- 
terpretation of nature, and for subsidiary motives 
the pride of patriotism and the sense of Canada's 
historical and legendary past.

Professor Huxley J 

on Evolution ture on " Jiivolution and Ethics 

(Macmillan) has, of course, all the 
familiar characteristics of the author's popular writ- 
ings the vigorous but not ungraceful style, the 
acute logic, and the comprehensive outlook. The 
significant thing about its matter is to be found in 
its attitude toward the ultra-individualism of which 
Mr. Spencer is the most distinguished representa- 
tive. It is true, Mr. Huxley contends, that the 
world has been shaped by the evolutionary process 
(as most deep souls have seen for two or three 
thousand years past), and that " the survival of the 
fittest " is a formula useful in the solution of most 
of the problems of development. But when we rise 
to the ethical stage of development, the term " fit- 
test " must be given a modified meaning ; here, at 
least, it means more than physical superiority. Civ- 
ilization means, according to Mr. Huxley, the sub- 
stitution of an " ethical process " for the " cosmic 
process," the relation of the two being happily

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



illustrated by the relation of the " governor " to the 
engine of which it is essentially a part. " The prac- 
tice of that which is ethically best what we call 
goodness or virtue involves a course of conduct 
which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads 
to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. 
In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self- 
restraint ; in place of thrusting aside, or treading 
down, all competitors, it requires that the individ- 
ual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fel- 
lows ; its influence is directed, not so much to the 
survival of the fittest, as to the fitting of as many 
as possible to survive. It repudiates the gladia- 
torial theory of existence." This is very effective, 
but we fear that it is also a little rhetorical. Let 
us look at the next sentence : " It demands that each 
man who enters into the enjoyment of the advan- 
tages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt to 
those who have laboriously constructed it ; and shall 
take heed that no act of his weakens the fabric in 
which he has been permitted to live." In these 
last words is concealed the whole contention. Is 
not that fabric weakened by some of the acts of 
which approval is above implied? Mr. Spencer 
would reply with an emphatic affirmative, and we 
see no escape from the conclusion that Mr. Huxley 
has, after all, begged the question. In other words, 
to the argument fairly and squarely stated by Mr. 
Spencer in " The Man vs. the State," Mr. Huxley 
has given an evasive reply. What is needed in this 
discussion is a careful analysis of the acts done 
by philanthropic people in the name of altruism, 
in order to determine which of those acts really 
strengthen the social fabric, and which of them tend 
ultimately to weaken it. Such an analysis Mr. 
Huxley fails to give us. Certainly, " the fitting of 
as many as possible to survive " (taking for granted 
that survival implies reproduction) is a social rule 
that can only result in a weakening of the social 
fabric on its physical side. And it remains to 
be shown that the ethical gain is sufficient to com- 
pensate for the physical loss. We do not say that 
this may not be shown ; we only assert that Mr. 
Huxley makes no attempt to show it, and that he 
leaves the question precisely where it was left by 
Mr. Spencer's trenchant polemic. 

Characteristic M{ "7 R Claflin's "Personal Recol- 
stories and say- lections of Whittier " (Crowell), a 

ings of Whittier. , 1 , , . 

pretty booklet of ninety-five pages, 
is solidly packed with matter of the sort that forms 
the right pith and essence of biography. Mrs. 
Claflin knew Whittier intimately, and is thus ena- 
bled to supply a stock of characteristic stories and 
sayings that give a clearer idea of the poet's per- 
sonality than could be gained from volumes of the 
spongy and labored dissertation which average crit- 
icism sheds about the memory of departed (and 
therefore defenceless ) eminence. Whittier a clear- 
seeing, genuine soul, to whom conventionalism was 
a farce and cant an abomination was annoyed and 
embarrassed by the gushing expressions of silly ad- 



mirers. " He said to me," says the author, " 'What 
does thee think women make such silly speeches to 
me for? It makes me feel like a fool. A woman 
said to me yesterday, " Mr. Whittier, your smile is 
a benediction." As I was walking across the floor 
at the Radical Club a woman stopped me in the 
middle of the parlor among all the folks and said, 
" I've long wished to see you, Mr. Whittier, to ask 
you what you thought of the subjective and the ob- 
jective." Why, I thought the woman was crazy, 
and I said, " I don't know anything about either of 
'em " ' " which was a solution worthy of Mr. Dick. 
One shudders to think of the Orphic answer which 
A. Bronson Alcott would have made to this all too- 
tempting query. Mr. Whittier was always reluctant 
to meet strangers especially on formal occasions. 
"On one occasion," says Mrs. Claflin, "I invited 
some of his old acquaintances to an afternoon tea. . . 
He was so shy that he could not be counted upon, 
and often, if he suspected company had been invi- 
ted to meet him, he would slip away. With his 
keen perception and insight, he discovered that 
something a little out of the ordinary course was 
going on, and he said, ' What is thee going to do ? 
I think thee is going to do something.' I replied, 
'Why do you think so, Mr. Whittier?' 'Oh, I 
know thee is going to have some kind of a fandan- 
go.' " When the guests came, however, the poet 
received them cordially, and the " fandango " passed 
off without friction. The volume contains two por- 
traits of Mr. Whittier, and a poem by Miss Edna 
Dean Proctor embodying "his almost life-long plaint 
of sleepless nights, and the gladness with which he 
hailed the dawn."

Dr. Charles Waldstein has sought to compass in a 
small volume recently published (Harper). He 
discusses in successive chapters the work of Mr. 
Ruskin as an art-critic, as "the founder of phae- 
nomenology of nature," as " a writer and prose- 
poet," as a student of social and economical ques- 
tions, and as an opponent of the sporting element 
in English life. Each of these subjects is treated 
in a scientific manner, and with evident conscien- 
tiousness. Upon one or two of them Dr. Waldstein 
is peculiarly competent to pass judgment, and upon 
all of them his opinion is deserving of respectful 
attention. Yet the note of the entire book seems to 
us one of defective sympathy, of penetration to a 
certain depth only, and of obtuseness to all that 
lies beneath that depth. His critique of Mr. Rus- 
kin's work as a social reformer is the most accept- 
able part of the study, although there are some ex- 
cellent observations in the chapter on English sports 
and pastimes. But justice has hardly been done 
to Mr. Ruskin's attitude towards the latter subject ; 
the spirit of his writings upon this theme is not as 
antagonistic as the author would have us believe. 
As a critic of art we still prefer Mr. Ruskin to Dr.

Waldstein, for the latter sees only the technical 
aspect of art, while the former takes into account 
the spiritual and ethical aspects as well. Mr. Rus- 
kin's dictum that art has a moral no less than an intel- 
lectual message has always been a stumbling-block 
in the way of most of his critics, yet we are inclined 
to think that he has in no other way done greater 
service to his fellows than by his insistence, in sea- 
son and out of season, upon this fundamental tenet. 



A text-book of *" stoi y f French literature, 

French literature studied in the French language, 
ought to be an essential part of the 
French course in our high schools. When that 
course covers the full period of four years, the 
last of the four may suitably be devoted to this 
subject. An excellent text-book for such study is 
provided by Madame Delphine Duval's " Petite 
Histoire de la Litte'rature Francaise" (Heath), 
which is written in a simple and attractive style, 
and covers the entire period of French literary 
history. Such a book as this has long been needed, 
and we give it a cordial welcome. One or two points 
which have attracted our attention while reading 
the book may be briefly mentioned. It is a little 
curious to be told, in a comparison of the " Chanson 
de Roland " with the " Iliad," that the former poem 
is the loftier in thought. We should hardly char- 
acterize Celimene as "une coquette maligne," nor 
should we describe " Le Systeme de la Nature " as 
"logiquement absurde." Still less should we say 
that Gautier had " ni ide'es, ni sensibilite", ni imagi- 
nation." A few positive errors may be noted. The 
date of Moliere's birth is given as 1652 instead of 
1622. The writer says that it is not known exactly 
why Voltaire took his nom de guerre. On the con- 
trary, it is perfectly well known that Voltaire is the 
anagram of Arouet 1. j. (lejeune). We are told 
that Voltaire's works are about equally divided be- 
tween prose and verse. Really there is five or six 
times as much prose as verse. Finally, " Le Gendre 
de Monsieur Poirier" is the work of Sandeau and 
Augier, not of Sandeau and Scribe.

original sources. Mr wilder > 8 Lie of Shakespeare " 

(Little, Brown, & Co.) may feel some surprise at 
the statement in his Prefatory Note that " no brief 
and accurate biography of Shakespeare is now be- 
fore the public." But on reflection, the statement is 
seen to be strictly true. Many indeed there are which 
are neither brief nor accurate, many more which are 
brief but not accurate, while only one Halliwell- 
Phillips's " Outlines " can be said to be strictly 
based on evidence ; and that, containing as it does a 
large amount of illustrative and collateral matter, is 
so far from being brief that it extends to two immense 
volumes. While this monumental work is greatly 
valued by Shakespeare students, its bulk and great 
inclusiveness of minute details unfit it for the uses of 
the average reader of Shakespeare wishing the sim- 



ple facts of the poet's life. Mr. Wilder's plan has 
been to copy and combine from the best sources 
Halliwell-Phillips being of course the chief only 
the proven facts, and to present them in due order 
without comment. The first twenty pages are de- 
voted to John Shakespeare, the poet's father, and 
begin with the year 1551, when he left the parental 
home and settled in Stratford-on-Avon. There, in 
1564, the baptismal register records the birth of 
the son afterwards to make the name so illustrious. 
The details in the life of William Shakespeare are 
limited almost entirely to records of his business 
transactions, dates of the presentation of certain of 
his plays or of their publication. Of his manner of 
daily life, his methods of composition, his tastes 
and interests, we know absolutely nothing ; the 
books which aspire to describe these may be highly 
entertaining but are absolutely untrustworthy. The 
present work does not profess to supply a connected 
narrative ; this would be a task now forever impos- 
sible to any diligence ; but it does give compactly the 
results of the best scholarship and most careful scru- 
tiny applied to the collection of all that can now be 
gathered concerning the life of the most distin- 
guished of all English poets. 

A social and economic philosophy 

factors in . p i 

American based on the doctrine ot evolution 

has not yet been completely formu- 
lated. But numerous books, pamphlets, arid mono- 
graphs are constantly appearing dealing with one 
phase or another of these questions, and seeking to 
apply scientific evolutionary principles to the de- 
tailed problems of sociology and economics. The 
Brooklyn Ethical Society, having directed its studies 
of the past winter in this direction, now issues a 
volume of essays and discussions the fifth of its 
series called "Factors in American Civilization" 
(Appleton). The papers are fourteen in number, 
each by a different author, consequently not all 
equally valuable. Among the best are Prof. De 
Garmo's "The Nation: its Place in Civilization," 
in which he advocates a spiritual conception of the 
duties of the State, in opposition to the police idea ; 
Rev. John C. KimbalTs " Natural Factors in Amer- 
ican Civilization," discussing the influence of geol- 
ogy, geography, natural scenery, and the human 
factor; "The Social and Political Status of Wo- 
man," by Rev. John W. Chadwick, treated with his 
usual wit and wisdom ; " The Labor Problem," by 
that special student of the subject, Nicholas P. Gil- 
man, and "The Philosophy of History," by E. P. 
Powell, who, in his book " Our Heredity from God," 
has done more than almost any American writer to 
popularize the teachings of evolution.

most of them reprinted from the " Fortnightly Re- 
view." The following extract from an astonishing 
little treatise on "The Weaker Vessel" indicates, 
in a way, Mr. Patmore's general attitude toward 
modern views and tendencies : " To maintain that 
man and woman are equals in intelligent action is 
just as absurd as it would be to maintain that the 
hand that throws a ball and the wall that casts it 
back are equal. The woman has an exquisite per- 
ception and power of admiring all the man can be 
or do. She is the glory of his prowess and nobility 
in war, statesmanship, arts, invention, and manners ; 
and she is able to fulfil this, her necessary and de- 
lightful function, just because she is herself nothing 
in battle, policy, poetry, discovery, or original intel- 
lectual or moral force of any kind." Mr. Patmore 
seems to have fallen into the error of mistaking 
woman as he would like to see her, for woman as 
she is. That the sex is not wholly made up of 
"Amelia Sedleys," the people of Chicago, at least, 
have had ocular and aural demonstration in this year 
of Columbian "Congresses." 



A Manual 
of Physics for 
High Schools. 



The " High School Laboratory Man- 
ual of Physics" (Ginn), prepared by 
Messrs. Dudley G. Hays, Charles D. 
Lowry, and Austin C. Rishel, is the best book of 
the sort that we have yet seen. It is the work of 
three experienced teachers, and the 113 exercises 
it prescribes cover the entrance requirements in 
physics of Harvard University, which are .probably 
higher than those of any other institution. The 
following prefatory statement is admirable in its 
good sense : " The authors are not so visionary as 
to suppose that boys and girls can, unaided, redis- 
cover the laws of physics ; but we know that, if suf- 
ficiently careful directions are given to pupils in the 
performance of experiments, and definite instruc- 
tion is given them as to the manner of studying 
results obtained, they will learn from Nature first- 
hand many of her great laws." Our only quarrel 
with the book is that it begins with the subject of 
magnetism, for very inadequate reasons displaced 
from its proper position. 



"Builders of 

American 

Literature." 



A book of two hundred and eighty- 
five pages which attempts to give 
biographical sketches of one hundred 
and eleven different persons cannot be much more 
than a mere catalogue of names and dates. Hence, 
Mr.Underwood's "Builders of American Literature" 
(Lee & Shepard ) arouses little expectation of serious 
literary value. Yet even that little is hardly satisfied 
by these barren and lifeless sketches of some of the 
most interesting figures in American literature. 
The book begins with Jonathan Edwards and in- 
cludes only authors born previous to 1826 ; a sec- 
ond series is promised in order to bring the list 
down to date. Let us hope that a little more ex- 
clusiveness in selection will reduce the number of 
names and afford more opportunity for doing jus- 
tice to those that remain. 



" Thumb-nail Sketches " (The Cent- 

ur y Co -)' a daint ^ booklet that y 

be handily slipped into the waistcoat

drawings, contributed by Geo. Wharton Edwards to 
the Century Magazine. Mr. Wharton's touch, pic- 
torial and descriptive, is light and suggestive, and 
his vein of whimsical humor and turn for bizarrerie 
pleasantly recall Mr. Stockton. The little book, 
with its full gilt edges and dainty cover of stamped 
sheep, makes a pretty and suitable holiday souvenir. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



ONE who wishes to learn about the management of 
horses may do worse than turn back to Xenophon, 
whose treatise on " The Art of Horsemanship " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) has just been put anew into English, this 
time by Professor Morris H. Morgan. Professor Mor- 
gan's translation is accompanied by an original essay 
upon " The Greek Riding-Horse," by horse-talk from a 
number of classical authors other than Xenophon, by 
copious notes, and by illustrations from the Parthenon 
frieze and other sources. The book is one that no lover 
of horses will wish to do without. 

SEFTON CHURCH in Lancashire is a structure whose 
beginnings are thought to date from the early twelfth 
century, and which, although rebuilt, retains many an- 
tique features of historical and architectural interest. 
To the painstaking industry of the Rev. Engelbert 
Horley, and to Messrs. W. D. Caroe and E. J. A. Gor- 
don, who have collected and arranged the materials left 
by Mr. Horley, we owe a very large and handsome vol- 
ume upon the subject of Sefton Church and town. 
More than half the volume is devoted to the curious 
history of the Mock Corporation of Sefton. The work 
is prefaced by a plea for the restoration of the church, 
but in a sense of which, we think, Mr. Ruskin would ap- 
prove. The work has many illustrations, nearly a score 
of them being full-page plates. (Longmans). 

MR. CLINTON D. HIGBY'S "A General Outline of 
Civil Government" (Lee & Shepard) is a very small 
book. We are not quite sure that so small a book upon so 
large a subject is to be justified. However, Mr. Higby, 
within his limits, has made a good selection of facts, 
and has stated them clearly. His chapters on local 
government are particularly to be commended, although 
they now and then contain startling statements, such as 
this : " The New England town, however, has no En- 
glish prototype, it is from Holland." Great contro- 
versies are not to be thus briefly disposed of. 

ESQUEMELING'S famous work on " The Buccaneers 
of America," which was reprinted in a popular series of 
the classics of adventure not long ago, now comes to 
us in another and far more pretentious form of repro- 
duction (imported by Scribner). It is edited by Mr. 
Henry Powell, and includes the text of 1684, and Basil 
Ringrose's Fourth Part of the following year. It con- 
tains a map and facsimiles of the original engravings. 
Mr. Powell contributes a somewhat extended descriptive 
introduction. The work is a handsome octavo of five 
hundred pages.

June, 1850, to November, 1892. The last edition of 
this index, which comprised seventy volumes, is here 
reprinted unchanged upon the odd-numbered pages. 
Upon the even-numbered pages are the entries referring 
to the subsequent fifteen volumes. While this is slightly 
less convenient than a single alphabetical arrangement 
would be, it is still an easy matter to find what the mag- 
azine has had upon any subject, and the publishers 
would hardly have been justified in going to the expense 
of new plates for the sake of the later volumes. 

THE "Men of Achievement" series (Scribner) has 
received two accessions. Mr. Noah Brooks has writ- 
ten character sketches of a round dozen of " States- 
men," from Clay and Webster to Garfield and Mr. 
Cleveland sketches too colorless to be impressive, and 
too laudatory to be accepted as serious history. Mr. W. 
O. Stoddard's " Men of Business " are sixteen in num- 
ber, and include J. J. Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, 
Cyrus W. Field, Peter Cooper, Messrs. P. D. Armour, 
Marshall Field, and George M. Pullman, and the unique 
Mr. Depew. Both of these volumes have simple illus- 
trations. 

MR. E. S. MARTIN'S "Windfalls of Observation" 
(Scribner) are pleasant little essays that may be classi- 
fied somewhere between " The Reveries of a Bachelor " 
and " Virginibus Puerisque." There are sixteen of 
them, on such subjects as " Courtship," " College," " Di- 
vorce," and " Death." We find in them shrewd obser- 
vation, pointed anecdote, and a subdued but ready wit. 
They are of the sort of literature to take up at odd mo- 
ments, and lay aside with but a momentary regret. 
One who is reading them feels himself in good society, 
and is likely to be the better for their wholesome pre- 
cepts. 

As a supplement to the "Annals of the American 
Academy of Political and Social Science " (Philadel- 
phia) we have a pamphlet monograph on " Inland Water- 
ways: Their Relation to Transportation," by Dr. Emory 
R. Johnson. The author discusses English and Amer- 
ican canals in their influence upon the development of 
a country and in their effect upon railway tariffs, gives 
an account of the waterways now in operation or pro- 
cess of construction, considers their economic bearings, 
and contrasts their execution by public and private en- 
terprise, with decision in favor of the State. There is 
a special chapter on the Nicaragua Canal. 

THE Rev. James Wood has compiled a " Dictionary 
of Quotations " (Warne) of 30,000 entries, including 
proverbs and pithy sayings from the principal ancient 
and modern languages. The quotations are all in a 
single alphabet, but the compiler does not seem to have 
the most rudimentary notion of what alphabetical ar- 
rangement means. We find entries under the articles, 
definite and indefinite, in all the languages represented, 
and such entries as " a belief " between " ab alio " and 
" abends." This fundamental and unpardonable error 
is partly remedied by an extensive topical index. In 
spite of its faults, literary workers will find the book 
useful. 

SIGNOR F. TARDUCCI'S work on "John and Sebas- 
tian Cabot " has been put into English by Mr. Henry 
F. Brownson (Detroit: The Author), who also trans- 
lated Tarducci's life of Columbus. This translation is 
authorized, even in its occasional departures from the 
original. Signor Tarducci has fixed the date of John 
Cabot's discovery of our continent as June 24, 1494. 
He has also established the Venetian nationality of both 



the Cabots. The work is a minute and painstaking 
study, based upon many newly unearthed documents, 
and modifies in several respects the current estimate of 
the two navigators. The work makes a volume of more 
than four hundred pages. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, Oct. 25, 1893. 

Mr. George Haven Putnam, for so many years the 
head of the publishing house founded by his father, has 
long been known as a frequent contributor to the peri- 
odicals, in articles concerning copyright and the relations 
of publishers and authors. With other Americans he 
was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor 
for his services in getting the International Copyright 
bill through Congress, and he has been active in all mat- 
ters connected with the writing and publishing of books. 
It can hardly be said that literary men generally look 
upon him as an advocate of their peculiar interests, but 
in all cases where the mutual interests of publishers and 
authors are at stake Mr. Putnam can be found vigor- 
ously maintaining the struggle. This being the case, it 
has been somewhat of a surprise that Mr. Putnam has 
not collected his extensive store of information on these 
subjects in permanent book form. He has edited "The 
Question of Copyright " in the " Questions of the Day" 
series, and has written a little book, " Authors and Pub- 
lishers: a Manual of Suggestions for Beginners in Lit- 
erature," which, I take it, is quite as useful for begin- 
ners in publishing as for beginners in literature. These 
have been his only volumes of the kind. I am now glad 
to announce that Mr. Putnam has been engaged for 
some years upon a work of great importance, being " A 
Sketch of the History of Literary Property from the 
Invention of Printing to the Berne Convention." A vol- 
ume introductory to this work, by Mr. Putnam, " Au- 
thors and Their Public in Ancient Times," has already 
been announced to appear this fall. Its chapters deal 
with the very beginnings of literature in Chaldea, 
Egypt, China, Japan, India, and Judea, and with the 
subject as presented in the literatures of Greece, Alex- 
andria, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire, down to the 
invention of printing. There will also be an interesting 
chapter on " book terminology in ancient times." When 
our universities East and West are each the happy pos- 
sessor of a " school of letters," no doubt these volumes 
by Mr. Putnam will form the standard text books on 
their subject. There is no question that they will prove 
the most important contributions yet made to the his- 
tory of literary property. 

M. Paul Blouet, that citizen of the world, has reached 
London again, having travelled around the globe dur- 
ing his lecture tour of the last two years. The final 
series of lectures was delivered in South Africa, and 
was the most successful in his experience. His Amer- 
ican agents wish him to lecture here this winter, but 
he prefers to indulge in a period of rest and recreation. 
He has taken a charming little cottage on the Acacia 
Road, a few minutes' ride from Regent's Park, in a 
neighborhood where many of his friends and acquaint- 
ances have their homes. Mr. Henry Harland (" Sidney 
Luska") has also returned to London, having spent 
an idyllic summer, with his wife, at a small village on 
the northern coast of France, near Dieppe. With six of 
their friends, young English painters, they occupied a 
cottage at Varengeville, one of Normandy's most pic-

turesque places, and devoted themselves about equally 
to work and to pleasure. There is no prospect of the 
Harlands returning to New York in the near future. 
They have probably become permanent members of our 
literary colony abroad. In recent work Mr. Harland 
seems to have given up his realistic studies of Jewish 
life in the metropolis, and to have joined the ranks of 
the French symbolists. 

The Maeterlinck movement is upon us at last, in the 
shape of a production of this writer's play, " The In- 
truder " (P/n<rMse), by students of Mr. Franklin H. Sar- 
gent's Academy of the Dramatic Arts. Ibsen has so 
quickly succeeded Browning, and now Maeterlinck seems 
so likely to displace Ibsen, in the estimation of our lit- 
erary f urorists, that one cannot help wondering who and 
what will succeed Maeterlinck and his work. Mr. Henry 
M. Alden, editor of " Harper's Magazine," than whom 
there is no more subtle philosopher in our country, 
has said the best word about " the new Shakespeare." 
In an interview he expresses himself as follows: "Maet- 
erlinck is interesting. He has based his plays, <Les 
Aveugles,' ' L'Intruse,' and ' Les Sept Princesses,' on 
primitive sensations of fear and apprehension. The at- 
traction which this fear of fear has always had for man 
contains the spirit of adventure. Maeterlinck would do 
his work better if he were better acquainted with the 
nature of the law under which he is working almost un- 
consciously." 

Mrs. Lucy Gibbons Morse, whose novel of anti-slavery 
times in New York is soon to be published by Messrs. 
Houghton, besides being a granddaughter of Isaac T. 
Hopper, the Quaker philanthropist, is the daughter of 
the late James Sloan Gibbons, who wrote the popular 
war lyric, " We are coining, Father Abra'am, three hun- 
dred thousand more," and the wife of Mr. James Her- 
bert Morse, a well-known litterateur and educator of 
this city. The Quaker speech is still used in the family 
life of the Morses. They are very hospitable, and their 
home on Madison avenue has been the scene of many 
entertainments in honor of distinguished literary visitors. 

Word comes from Newnham College that the women's 
colleges in America are held in small esteem there ; in 
fact, that no American girl has taken successfully the 
highest examinations in the leading English colleges. 
It is asserted that American girls cannot pass them, even 
after graduation at home followed by three years at 
Newnham. I hear that a society of " granddaughters 
of Vassar " has recently been formed by daughters of 
graduates who are themselves students at Vassar. Per- 
haps these statements are worthy of their attention.

M. Zola and Mr. William Nye have just been made

Dr. William Smith, editor of the familiar Classical 
Dictionaries, the Dictionary of the Bible, and other sim- 
ilar reference works, died on October 7, at the age of 
eighty. Since 1867 he had been the editor of " The 
Quarterly Review." 

M. Zola is reported to have expressed surprise at the

French, and to have said that there are but four French 
journalists of the present day who have a thorough 
knowledge of English. 

The forthcoming " Letters of Sir Walter Scott," to 
be published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., will fill nearly 
a thousand pages. They range from 1797 to 1825, 
when the " Journal " begins. As they were written to 
Scott's most intimate friends, they will prove hardly 
second to the " Journal " in interest. 

The new Norwegian law of copyright provides for 
ownership during the author's lifetime and the fifty 
years following. Anonymous and pseudonymous works 
secure copyright for fifty years from the date of their 
publication. This clearly puts a premium upon the ac- 
knowledgement of authorship, and is a step in the right 
direction. 

Herr Theodor Graf's unique collection of ancient 
Greek portraits, unearthed in the Fayoum a few years 
ago, has been on exhibition, during the summer, in Old 
Vienna, at the Columbian Exposition, and, during the 
past month, in one of the galleries of the Chicago Art 
Institute. The original find included nearly a hundred 
portraits; of these, about a score have been sold, a few 
are hung in the Exposition art gallery, and the remain- 
der, to the number of sixty-five, are on exhibition as 
above stated. The collection is of extraordinary inter- 
est, and it is to be hoped that a part of it, at least, may 
be secured for this country. 

Mr. Huxley prefaces a recent autobiographical sketch 
with the following hypothetical explanation of how a 
man may come to write such an account of himself: 
" An importunate person informs him that his portrait 
is about to be published, and will be accompanied by a 
biography which the importunate person purposes to 
write. The sufferer knows what that means; either 
he undertakes to revise the 'biography' or he does 
not. In the former case, he makes himself responsible ; 
in the latter, he allows the publication of a mass of 
more or less fulsome inaccuracies, for which he will be 
held responsible by those who are familiar with the 
prevalent art of self-advertisement. On the whole, it 
may be better to get over the ' burlesque of being em- 
ployed in this manner,' and do the thing himself." 

One of the most active spirits of the World's Con- 
gress Auxiliary was Lieut. Fletcher S. Bassett, U.S.N., 
who died in Chicago on the 19th of October, at the age 
of forty-three. The Folk-lore Congress, which was 
among the most important of the summer's gatherings, 
was mainly planned and organized by him, and to his 
disinterested and untiring zeal its great success was 
chiefly due. Lieut. Bassett served in the navy seven- 
teen years 1865 to 1882, loss of health compelling 
his retirement from active service. Afterwards he de- 
voted himself chiefly to literary and scientific work. He 
was especially interested in folk-lore, and was one of 
the founders of the Chicago Folk-lore Society and edi- 
tor of the " Folk-lorist " Magazine. He was a contrib- 
utor to THE DIAL and to varioiis literary and scientific 
periodicals.

A ROSE FROM OMAR'S GRAVE. 

Mr. Edmund Gosse has inscribed the following grace- 
ful verses to the rose-tree brought by Mr. W. Simpson 
from Omar's tomb in Naishapiir, and planted October 7 
on the grave of Edward FitzGerald at Boulge: 

" Reign here, triumphant rose from Omar's grave, 
Borne by a fakir o'er the Persian wave ; 

Reign with fresh pride, since here a heart is sleeping 
That double glory to your Master gave. 

" Hither let many a pilgrim step be bent, 
To greet the rose re-risen in banishment ; 

Here richer crimsons may its cup be keeping 
Than brimmed it ere from Naishdpiir it went.' 

The same subject has elicited from Mr. Theodore 
Watts the following sonnet, entitled " Prayer to the 
Winds": 

" Hear us, ye winds ! 

From where the North-wind strows 
Blossoms that crown ' the King of Wisdom's ' tomb, 
The trees here planted bring remembered bloom 
Dreaming in seed of Love's ancestral rose 
To meadows where a braver North-wind blows 
O'er greener grass, o'er hedge-rose, may, and broom, 
And all that make East England's field-perfume 
Dearer than any fragrance Persia knows : 

Hear us, ye winds, North, East, and West and South ! 
This granite covers him whose golden mouth 

Made wiser ev'n the Word of Wisdom's king : 
Blow softly o'er the grave of Omar's herald 

Till roses rich of Omar's dust shall spring 
From richer dust of Suffolk's rare FitzGerald ! " 



THE LATE MR. FREEMAN'S OPINION OF EMERSON 
AND BROWNING. 

From an entertaining article on the late E. A. Free- 
man, in " Scribner's Magazine " for November, we ex- 
tract the following characteristic utterances of the great 
historian on two of the most distinguished of his con- 
temporaries, Emerson and Browning: 

" Among essayists, he also failed to appreciate Emer- 
son, partly for the occasional lack of clearness in his 
writings, and partly for his poetical way of treating 
some historical events, which roused Mr. Freeman's im- 
patience. ' I took up a thing of his the other day,' he 
wrote, ' and his notion of the Norman Conquest was that 
" twenty thousand thieves founded the House of Lords!" 
He seemed to come into England not knowing anything 
whatever about anything.' 

" As to poetry, his fondness for a clear, direct style 
made him unable to appreciate such a poet as Browning. 
' Bother Browning and Emerson and all people who write 
not to be understood ! ' he wrote, in one of his letters. 
I well remember his enjoyment of the amusing incidents 
which we saw on Commemoration Day in Oxford in 
1882, when Browning received his honorary degree. Of 
all the witty and absurd sallies which came from the 
students in the upper galleries of the Sheldonian theatre 
that morning, none evoked so much laughter as those 
which met Robert Browning as he stood in his scarlet 
doctor's robe, during his presentation to the Vice-Chan- 
cellor. From the gallery a red cotton nightcap fastened 
to a string (referring to his ' Red Cotton Night-Cap 
Country') was dangled over the heads of the Vice-Chan- 
cellor and other dignitaries, as they sat in all their mag- 
nificence below, and was at last skilfully landed on the 
head of Browning himself. At the same time a huge 
cartoon was also let down, on which was a comical car- 
icature of the poet with an enormous head on a very 



little body, and beside him a similar figure of a member 
of the Browning Society, imploring him in a rhymed 
couplet to show him how to understand his poetry. Mr. 
Freeman sympathized heartily with that member of the 
Browning Society, for he could not get hold of Brown- 
ing's poetry, though personally he liked him. In April, 
1884, he wrote : 

" ' At that dinner I sat opposite to Browning, and 
found that in private life he was much like another man. 
I had thought that his Comitatus, the Browning Society, 
would follow him everywhere to explain what he said. 
But if a man can talk to be understood, why can't he 
write to be understood? But those things are not in 
my line Homer and Macaulay for me them I can 
understand.' " 

M. ZOLA AND MR. OSCAR WILDE. 
The following amusing incident of M. Zola's visit to 
London is reported by the newspaper correspondents : 
" On the night of his arrival in London M. Zola was re- 
covering from the fatigue of the journey under the be- 
nign influence of the Savoy cuisine, and had just reached 
the stage when a cup of coffee and a cigar put a fin- 
ishing stroke on the soothing process of digestion, when 
the door opened and a waiter entered, bearing a mag- 
nificent basket of flowers. The gratified guest supposed 
at first that this was but another token of the manager's 
kind attention, but he had not time to express his thanks 
before the attendant delivered the following message : 
'Mr. Oscar Wilde, sir, sends these flowers and asks if 
you will receive him for a few minutes.' The words 
were roughly translated to M. Zola, who still seemed 
puzzled and shook his head, exclaiming : ' Oscawoile ! 
Oscawoile ! Je ne le connais pas.' ' Qu' est-ce que c'est 
done que cette espece d'animal, Oscawoile ? ' inquired 
a famous journalist, equally ignorant of English pro- 
nunciation. ' Qu'on lui rende ses legumes et qu'on le 
mette a la porte,' cried another. At last the personal 
conductor of the party got a hearing and explained that 
the unknown donor was the apostle of British sestheti- 
cism a recommendation which failed to touch the 
hearts of his audience. Finally M. Zola bethought 
himself of looking at the gentleman's card, and at once 
a smile of intelligence lit up his expressive features as 
he gasped out in repentant accents : ' Mais, Nom de 
Dieu, c'est Monsieur Oscarre Veelde, 1'auteur de " Sa- 
lomd," que nous connaissons tous. Faites-le monter de 
suite.' ' Oscarre Veelde ! ' shouted all the others, ' pour- 
quoi ne pas 1'avoir dit d'abord ? ' And so the two mas- 
ter spirits of the age were brought into contact." 

PROGRESS OF THE NEWSPAPER PRESS. 

The following figures are from a report of Mr. J. A. 
Strahan's paper on " The Progress of the Newspaper 
Press," recently read before the British Association : 

" In 1712 the year when the stamp tax on newspapers was 
first imposed the yearly circulation of newspapers in En- 
gland was about 2,000,000. In 1755 it was about 7,400,000, in 
1767 about 11,300,000, in 1801 about 16,000,000, in 1811 about 
25,500,000, in 1820 about 29,500,000, in 1831 about 37,700,000, 
in 1836 about 39,400,000. In 1837 the stamp tax was reduced 
from 3 l-4d. net to a penny, and the circulation that year rose 
to nearly 54,000,000. In 1841 it had increased to about 60,- 
000,000. In 1854 the last year of the stamp tax it stood 
at 122,000,000. Since 1854 estimates of circulation must be 
largely conjectural and approximate ; but the great increase 
in the number of newspapers, from 493 in 1840 to 1817 in 1882, 
and to 2200 in 1893, and the even more marked increase in 
the number of persons connected with journalism, as shown 
by the census for example, of ' authors, editors, and writers,'

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



from 1528 in 1861 to 3434 in 1881, and of reporters from 636 
in 1861 to 2677 in 1881 show that newspaper production must 
have increased enormously. Other figures point the same 
way. There are now twenty-nine daily papers morning and 
evening in London. Taking the average daily circulation 
of each as about 100,000 copies, the annual circulation of the 
London dailies alone must approach 1,000,000,000. The 170 
provincial dailies must have at least an equal circulation. 
The yearly circulation of daily papers alone then must reach 
2,000,000,000."

THE DIAL'S CONTRIBUTORS. 



The following list, which includes all the names that have been signed to articles in THE DIAL since its begin- 
ning, is published for the purpose of showing how varied are the intellectual interests represented by the review, 
and how serious and authoritative its contents. It will be noticed that the institutions of higher learning have 
furnished THE DIAL with a large proportion of its contributors, and that our most important universities, with 
hardly an exception, are represented in the list. THE DIAL feels that it has reason to be proud of a list that 
includes the chief justice of the United States, presidents or professors of some thirty colleges and universities, 
and many of the most distinguished private scholars in the country.

CHOICE HOLIDAY BOOKS. 



TALES FROM SHAKESPEARE. 

By CHARLES and MARY LAMB, with a continuation by HAR- 
RISON S. MORRIS, author of " Tales from Ten Poets," etc. 
Four volumes. 16mo. Illustrated, cloth, extra, $4-00; 
half calf or half morocco, $8,00; three-quarters calf , $10.00. 
Edition de luxe (limited to 150 copies). Four volumes. 
Small 8vo. Cloth, $12.00 net. 

The twenty tales from the plays of Shakespeare by Charles 
and Mary Lamb are the most useful and agreeable companions 
to an understanding of Shakespeare that have ever been pro- 
duced. They are included in the first two volumes of this 
edition. In the two remaining volumes, Mr. Morris completes 
the plays, and in a brief space presents each plot and story in 
a most engaging manner.

in boxes. $5.00 per set ; half calf, $10.00. 

" The Romance of Reality," the sub-title of the work, ad- 
mirably indicates its character, for within its pages may be 
found grouped the scene of those romantic and eventful inci- 
dents which form the pith of the history of the leading mod- 
ern nations, and many of which have long been favorites in 
popular lore. The half-tone illustrations, twelve in each vol- 
ume, add to the beauty and historical value of an otherwise 
attractive work.

ings by FREDERICK DIEHLMAN. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00 ; pa- 
per, 50 cents. 

" The new edition of this familiar story, issued uniform 
with the latest issue of ' The Wide. Wide World,' will be 
gladly welcomed by thousands of old friends and by many 
new ones. The work has always been eagerly sought and 
read. The moral lessons in it will never be out of style, and 
its homely simplicity and rich pictures of child-life will always 
attract the young."

pany, of London. Illustrated with etchings by HERBERT 
RAILTON. Six volumes. 16mo. Cloth, $6.00.

This remarkable novel, introducing many of the characters,

THE ENDOWMENTS OF CULTURE 
IN CHICAGO. 

Mr. Marshall Field's magnificent gift of a 
million dollars, for the establishment of a pub- 
lic museum in Chicago, will add one more to 
the lengthening list of the city's endowed in- 
stitutions. It is true that the gift is made con- 
tingent upon certain conditions, but they are 
not onerous, and it is already practically cer- 
tain that they will be fulfilled. Mr. Field's 
offer is made upon a plan that has found much 
favor with recent philanthropists. He stipu- 
lates that half a million dollars more shall be 
raised by subscription, and that a further con- 



tribution of Exposition stock, to the nominal 
amount of two millions, shall be made by its 
holders. As the probable value of this stock 
will be from ten to fifteen per cent, of its nom- 
inal value, the Columbian Museum will have 
a total endowment of one and three-quarters 
millions. It is probable that the Museum will 
acquire the most beautiful of the Exposition 
structures the Art Building, designed by Mr. 
Atwood for its permanent home ; and thus, 
placed in the midst of an attractive park, eas- 
ily accessible, yet far from the bustle of busi- 
ness life, it will be ideally situated, and will 
stand as the worthiest possible memorial of the 
great Exposition once held at its doors. An 
incidental advantage of this situation will be 
found in its proximity to the University of 
Chicago, a proximity which will considerably 
enhance the educational possibilities of both 
institutions. 

It will, of course, be many years before the 
collections that go to make a great museum 
can be brought together, but probably no insti- 
tution of the sort ever had so much material 
to start with as is already assured the new en- 
terprise. Great liberality in this matter is be- 
ing displayed by the governments and individ- 
uals represented in the Exposition that has just 
closed its gates, and valuable offerings from 
many such sources have already been accepted 
by the trustees of the Museum. American an- 
thropology and archeology will be richly illus- 
trated by the collections already owned by the 
Exposition Company, and to be transferred to 
the custody of the Museum. The natural re- 
sources of this country, especially in woods and 
minerals, will also be abundantly displayed. 
Art will be represented by valuable collections 
of casts and photographs, at least ; as for orig- 
inal works, we must be content to wait awhile. 
The collection will, of course, be very incom- 
plete and unbalanced for some years, but a ju- 
dicious expenditure of the income from the en- 
dowment fund will accomplish wonders. But 
we must still remember that a museum, like a 
library, is not to be had for cash, and Chicago 
must be content, for a century or so, to be over- 
shadowed by the British Museum and a few 
other European institutions. 

It may be well to glance for a moment at 
the provision already made in this city for what 



286 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



may be called the endowment of culture. The 
new Museum is but the last of a long series of 
efforts, on the part of generous philanthropists, 
to place education, research, and art within 
easy reach of the people. The part played by 
the municipal government itself is of no mean 
importance. It ungrudgingly supports a very 
extensive and complete system of common and 
high school education, as well as a public li- 
brary system probably the most efficient in the 
whole country, and costly in proportion to its 
efficiency. A city which does these things does 
about all that is permitted by the spirit of 
American institutions, a spirit which has pos- 
sibly gone too far in its reaction against old- 
world paternalism, but which is the vital prin- 
ciple of our social organization. Fortunately, 
private generosity has not been lacking to carry 
on the work from the point where the public 
leaves it off, and nowhere else in the United 
States has private generosity done so much for 
the higher public welfare as in Chicago. Our 
great private endowments for public purposes 
offer the most conspicuous illustration of that 
" civic pride " which is rightly held to be a 
marked characteristic of this city, of that qual- 
ity which makes of Chicago a true social organ- 
ism in a sense not to be predicated of New 
York, hardly to be predicated of any other 
great American city. 

The endowment of our higher education is 
represented by the new University of Chicago, 
which, in means, strength of faculty, and ele- 
vation of standard, already ranks among the 
foremost of American institutions of the higher 

O 

learning. This endowment we owe, primarily, 
to Mr. Rockefeller, who is not a Chicagoan, 
but also in large measure to those of our 
wealthy citizens who have so abundantly sup- 
plemented his gifts. Next in importance must 
be ranked the Armour Institute for second- 
ary and technical training, named from its 
founder, who has devoted from one to two mil- 
lion dollars to its purposes. The two manual 
training schools now in operation, and the 
Lewis polytechnic school soon to be established, 
are important additions to our endowed insti- 
tutions of education. The Newberry and Cre- 
rar Libraries, with their endowments of from 
two to four millions each, will provide Chica- 
goans of the near future with opportunities for 
research unequalled elsewhere upon the West- 
ern Continent. The Art Institute of Chicago, 
with its beautiful new building upon a public 
site, with its choice and rapidly increasing col- 
lection of original masterpieces and reproduc- 



tions, and with its well-organized schools, pro- 
vides the art-life of the community with a cen- 
tre, and offers excellent opportunities for art 
education. 

The Chicago of the future is thus certain 
to be well supplied to a considerable extent 
it is already supplied with the means of cul- 
ture represented by libraries and museums, art 
collections, and institutions of the technical and 
higher learning. The rapid survey above made 
shows us of what the community is already as- 
sured. The question still remains of what fur- 
ther endowments of culture are desirable, of 
what new outlet may be suggested for the ener- 
gies of the philanthropist, of what is needed to 
make the community in a sense complete in re- 
spect of the means whereby its intellectual and 
aesthetic wants may be satisfied. We would sug- 
gest in this connection, as both practicable and 
desirable, the endowment of three more insti- 
tutions a theatre, an orchestra, and a news- 
paper. Each of these three objects is worthy 
the attention of the philanthropist ; either of 
them would prove of incalculable value to the 
spiritual life of the community. 

The endowed, or at least subsidized, theatre 
is so well known in Europe that there would 
be nothing experimental in such an undertak- 
ing. But what is done in this direction by 
state authority in the old world must be done 
by private generosity in the new. It is a cu- 
rious coincidence that both of the distinguished 
actors Mr. Irving and Mr. Willard who 
have addressed the Twentieth Century Club 
during the present year should have made a 
common point of urging the importance of an 
endowed theatre in Chicago, and even of pre- 
dicting its establishment. When we think 
what an influence has been exerted by the three 
National Theatres of France, by the Court The- 
atres of a number of the States of Germany, 
or by the Royal Danish Theatre, upon the life 
and thought of their respective nations, we 
cannot escape the conclusion that such a school 
of good manners, of correct diction and pro- 
nunciation, of artistic stage presentation, and 
of literary art in one of its most important man- 
ifestations, would prove a force making in no 
slight degree for refinement and elevation, both 
intellectual and moral. And what is thus said 
of dramatic art applies with almost equal force 
to the art of music, the art that turns from 
treasons, stratagems and spoils the thoughts of 
men, to fix them upon worthier objects and 
higher aspirations. What the generosity of 
one gentleman of Boston has done for that city 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



287 



might surely be done for this much larger com- 
munity by one of its far wealthier citizens. 

The endowment of a newspaper, for the two- 
fold purpose of providing a dignified and trust- 
worthy record of contemporary happenings, and 
of showing the public, by means of a convinc- 
ing object-lesson, what journalism ought to be, 
has been suggested more than once in the pages 
of THE DIAL. A recent article in " The Fo- 
rum " says : " A great newspaper might be es- 
tablished and maintained by endowment, just 
as great universities are so established and 
maintained. The analogy between the two un- 
dertakings is very close ; with a suitable endow- 
ment forthcoming, there appears to be no reason 
why a Delane should not be found to accom- 
plish for a newspaper what President Jordan 
and President Harper have accomplished for 
the great new universities of the West." With 
this repetition of a suggestion that is likely 
sometime to bear fruit, we may close our dis- 
cussion of the endowment of culture. No mil- 
lionaire, oppressed by the responsibilities of his 
wealth, need despair of putting it to beneficent 
uses as long as such opportunities as we have 
above hinted at remain ungrasped. 



FRANCIS PARKMAN. 

For many years past, the popular consciousness 
has placed Bancroft and Prescott, Motley and Park- 
man, in a class by themselves, and assigned to them 
the highest rank among American historians. They 
are now all numbered with the dead ; for Francis 
Parkman, the last of the quartet to remain with us, 
succumbed to a sudden illness on the eighth of this 
month. We have only space upon this occasion for a 
brief note upon his life and work. Born in 1823, he 
celebrated his seventieth birthday a few weeks ago. 
He was graduated from Harvard in 1844, and two 
years thereafter made an extensive trip to the 
Rocky Mountains. The result of this trip was " The 
Oregon Trail," his first book, published in 1847. 
In 1851 appeared "The Conspiracy of Pontiac." 
His third book was " Vassall Morton," a novel now 
forgotten, published in 1856. The next ten years 
of his life were spent in the collection of material 
for his great historical work on "France and En- 
gland in North America." The seven parts of this 
work appeared at intervals between 1866 and 1892. 
They are entitled: "The Pioneers of France in 
the New World" (1866); "The Jesuits in North 
America in the Seventeenth Century" (1868); "La 
Salle and the Discovery of the Great West " (1869); 
"The Old Regime in Canada" (1874); "Count 
Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV." 
(1877); "Montcalm and Wolfe" (1884); and, 
last of all, "A Half Century of Conflict" (1892). 



A "Book of Roses" (1866) illustrates his interest in 
horticulture. The New York " Evening Post " pays 
the following tribute to the man and his works : 
" His series of historical monographs are among the 
glories of American literature. They have Macau- 
lay's charm with far more than Macaulay's accu- 
racy. They were produced in the midst of great 
physical suffering and disability, which never seemed 
to abate his powers of research or mar the sweet- 
ness of his temper. He belonged to a generation 
of Boston litterateurs of whom Lowell was facile 
princeps, who never forgot that they were gentle- 
men as well as literary men, and upheld under all 
circumstances the tradition of personal dignity which 
came down from an earlier generation." 



ART AND LIFE ONCE MORE. 

There may not be much profit in discussing this 
question of style, form, art, as they are related to lit- 
erature, because very few persons seem to attach the 
same meaning to these words.* By style Matthew 
Arnold evidently means some subtle grace or gloss, 
that even great writers do not attain to. He says 
Wordsworth had 110 style ; Emerson, Carlyle, Goethe, 
lacked style ; yet the works of these men he con- 
sidered the most important this century had to show. 
Arnold himself doubtless had style, in his own mean- 
ing of the term, a delicate distinction about his 
work, prose and verse, like that of cut glass. If 
Emerson and Goethe lacked style, and Swift and 
Gray and Arnold had it, the coming literature can 
get along very well without it. But it cannot get 
along without that fresh, vital, and fragrant expres- 
sion, so aptly referred to by a recent writer in these 
pages.f 

Is it not true that the moment a man begins to 
take thought of his style as such as something 
apart, to be looked after on its own account, that 
moment he is lost ? With all true writers the mat- 
ter and the manner are one. The style is vital, and 
not something that can be put on at will. I like 
exceedingly a remark of Whitman's upon this sub- 
ject. He says, as regards style, form, art, etc., he 
has asked of them nothing but negative advantages 
" that they should never impede me, and never 
under any circumstances, or for their own purposes 
only, assume any mastery over me." Such masters 
of expression as Froude and Huxley say they take 
no thought of style. What they take thought of is 
the matter in hand. I once heard a woman who 
had written many books say to a well-known author, 
" What I so much admire in your writing is that 

*Mr. Hale, in THE DIAL for November 1, in commenting 
upon my view of Poe, in the preceding number, cautions us 
against the error we are likely to fall into if we neglect the 
study of style. His point is exceedingly well put, and his let- 
ter is itself as good as a specimen of simple and lucid style as 
one is likely to meet in many a day. It says the right thing 
right from his point of view in the best way.

wonderful style." " I never think about my style," 
he replied ; "I let that take care of itself." " That 
is why I so admire it," she said. 

One of the latest stylists, Mr. Walter Pater, ev- 
idently takes thought of wherewith his thought shall 
be clothed ; he does not consider the lilies of the 
field. " He" (the literary artist), he says, " moves 
slowly over his work, calculating the tenderest 
tones and restraining the subtlest curves, never let- 
ting hand or fancy move at large, gradually enforc- 
ing flaccid spaces to the highest degree of expres- 
sionship." This quotation from Mr. Pater may 
serve to point the discontent I am going to give 
vent to in this paper ; namely, with the tendency, so 
marked in current criticism, to exalt the art of lit- 
erature above the function of literature, and in gen- 
eral to make a fetich of what is called Art with a 
big A. To me the function of literature is to 
deepen our enjoyment of life and to strengthen our 
mastery over its elements ; and this end is defeated 
or interfered with if we keep our attention so 
strongly fixed upon the art phase of the subject. 
It is doubtful if literature as an art was ever before 
so much studied and discussed as now. Writers 
were never before, it seems to me, so intent upon 
making an artistic impression, and making that an 
end in itself. Four-fifths of the poetry in the cur- 
rent magazines seems to have no other reason for 
its existence than art to make the impression of 
faultless art. The lesson of art as it relates to lit- 
erature, says Mr. Pater, is that " whatever becomes 
of the fruit, make sure of the flower and the leaves." 
Art is not even to stimulate to noble ends ; it has 
no end outside of itself. Why does not nature 
rest with flowers and leaves alone ? Because she 
abhors a barren fig tree ; and is not the poem or 
other work that seeks the flower of art alone a bar- 
ren fig tree ? I doubt if the old writers and poets 
thought of literature at all in its artistic aspects ; 
they thought of it as a medium of communicating 
life and power, or the truth of nature. The art- 
feeling, or art-spirit, seems to me of modern growth 
and the result of long ages of literary culture. It 
is in our time a kind of disease. In the older 
writers the attention is fixed upon life and the 
truths that relate to life ; in the new men the atten- 
tion is fixed upon art and the considerations that 
relate to art. Our poets are more in love with 
poetry than with things. There is a morbid crav- 
ing for the beautiful as it is known to art, instead of 
a wholesome love for it as it appears in the total 
scheme of things. " It is the true breath of human- 
ity," says Renan, " and not literary merit, that con- 
stitutes the beautiful." But we are more and more 
fixing our attention upon the literary merit, and 
making that an end in itself. The human note 
first, the art note second, seems the proper order. 
The fulness with which the poet speaks the common 
feeling and experiences of mankind is what finally 
tells. " Unless the heart is shook," says Landor, 
"the gods thunder and stride in vain"; and the 
heart is only shook by heart power. 



In our day it seems much easier to strike the in- 
tellectual or the artistic note in poetry than the 
purely human note. The poets are more as schol- 
ars and craftsmen than they are as men. Seldom 
do we get a whiff, in current poetry, to say nothing 
of a full draught, of the simple, unadulterated, un- 
sophisticated human qualities. There may be art 
in escaping from art, and in moving the soul as na- 
ture does. Literature may appeal to our art-sense 
our sense of form and proportion, our sense of 
the polished and highly wrought ; it may appeal 
also to our life-sense our sense of real things, and 
our power to deal with them, our religious sense, 
our cosmic sense, our sense as simple human beings. 
There seems to be a tacit agreement among current 
critics that the appeal to our art-sense is the main 
matter; if the poem pleases, like a beautiful statue 
or a piece of delicate carving, that is enough. And 
perhaps it is enough, for that kind of poetry the 
poetry of art; but may there not be a larger kind, 
a poetry that shall have the flavor of life and real- 
ity? We have in this country some exquisite art- 
poets verse-makers who are like master workmen 
in ivory : such delicate, such beautiful verbal carv- 
ing, such grace, such lightness and sureness of touch. 
The verse seems almost fragile from its exquisite 
workmanship. I have great pleasure in it, but it is 
purely the pleasure I have in art, and is not akin 
to the pleasure I have in life and in real things. It 
pleases like a perfume, and not like the breath of 
the fields or the woods or the shore. 

There is little recognition in current criticism of 
the legitimacy and value of work like Whitman's, 
that aims to minimize, or escape entirely from, 
conscious exterior art the visible, palpable archi- 
tecture of verse and to tally the spirit of out-door 
nature, of growths, currents, cosmic and dynamic 
forces, and which in its form follows only the law 
of the inherent forms of organic nature. Such work 
is said to be without art, or to be outlawed of art ; 
as if to give the impression of the natural were less 
than to give the impression of the artificial ; as if 
to titillate our sense of form and measure were more 
than to quicken our sense of life and of things. It 
is interesting to note the strictures of Whitman's 
critics and expounders in treating his attitude toward 
art. One of his most friendly and thorough-going 
champions, Mr. William Clarke, says the effect of 
Whitman's work is to " stir our emotions, widen our 
interests, and rally the forces of our moral nature "; 
and yet he charges him with want of art, with lack 
of literary culture, etc. By what name, then, shall 
we call the gift, or power, that enables him to pro- 
duce these effects from a printed poem ? If a writer 
"endows us with the gift of life rather than with 
literature," has he not, after all, art of the most 
precious kind? The true artist is seen in his atti- 
tude of soul his attitude of loving and impassioned 
contemplation of nature and man. It is not simply 
the attitude of the man who would know things or 
the reason of things the scientist, but of the man 
who would have an emotional and spiritual enjoy- 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

ment of things and make others share in that en- 
joyment. It may he questioned if any great work 
of any kind sprang alone or primarily from the art 
impulse. Gothic and mediaeval art had their root 
in the religious impulse. In Dante there was a 
burden of love and sorrow which the art impulse 
came to relieve. The ancient sculpture forever sur- 
passes the modern because those men were stirred 
by some deeper impulse than the art impulse the 
desire merely to copy the human body in stone ; a 
whole world of emotion, a whole phase of life, of 
which we know little, lies back of that matchless 
carving. 

Mr. Edmund Gosse lately, in lecturing upon the 
Poetry of Women, said that woman had fallen 
short of the highest achievements in poetry, because 
she was lacking in the art impulse. But it seems 
to me the art impulse the desire to realize in con- 
crete form some ideal is just as marked in George 
Eliot, or George Sand, or Mrs. Browning, as in any 
masculine genius ; and if these women failed, as Mr. 
Gosse says they did, to attain to the highest results, 
it was from some deeper cause than feebleness of the 
art impulse. The mentality of woman is undoubt- 
edly stamped with her character, her limitations as 
woman her passive and receptive character, as op- 
posed to the aggressive and initiating character of 
man. It is not hers to beget or originate. Her 
work in literature rarely or never has the fertilizing, 
the kindling and quickening power of man's. The 
creative, the generative principle is not hers, at 
least only in a very limited measure. Her artistic 
instincts are keen, but she rarely has the same pas- 
sionate grip of her subject that a man has of his. 

The self-constituted guardians of the popular 
taste always assume that the principles of art and 
poetry are forever fixed and settled. They talk 
authoritatively of the poet's way or the artist's way 
of doing things, as if there were a way for all poets 
and all artists. Given a new man, and there is a 
new way. Art follows the master, and does not 
lead him. He makes free with her, takes his will 
of her, and she bears him offspring in his own im- 
age. Art is not something arbitrary and despotic, 
to be set up over genius. It is what the poet makes 
it. There is, of course, good art and bad art ; but 
the principle I am contending for is the relativity 
of all art that the standards are of no authority, 
that the final tests are in the soul to-day, that that 
which tastes good to the soul to-day is good no mat- 
ter how much it diverge from the authorities of the 
past. The final justification of any work is to be 
sought in the soul and personality of the artist, and 
not in a set of rules deduced from other works. Is 
the work consistent with itself with the man and 
his aim ? does it exist for worthy ideal ends ? does 
it give us a fresh and vivid impression of reality ? 
is it plastic and creative ? does it unfold out of an 
inherent principle like a plant or tree ? that is, is it 
vital and characteristic ? What distinguishes the 
artist in letters from the mere thinker ? It is, as 
Sche*rer says, that vigorous sensuousness, that con- 



crete and immediate impression of things, which 
the former gives us, and which we never get from 
the latter. The modern growth in religion is meas- 
ured by our revolt against the standards against 
creeds and formulas ; and we shall match it in art 
when art ceases to be a fetich and becomes a life 
when we seek our tests within and not without. 
The dogmatic method in criticism and in religion 
has had its day. Poetic truth is not a fixed quan- 
tity, and a great poet may arise in fact, has arisen 
who is poet on new terms, and in apparent op- 
position to the standards. T

BALLADE TO A BOOKMAN. 



Crotchety delver in books, 

Hater of all that is new, 
Seeker of cosiest nooks 

Known to the favorite few, 

Why should you ever ask who 
Fateward defiance hath hurled ? 

Delver in books, it is you 
You who have conquered the world. 

Snuffy old fellow whose looks 

Hint of a wig and a queue, 
Scorning the cates of the cooks 

For a pewter of ale and a stew, 

Why should you ever be blue, 
Seeing that runnels have purled, 

Since the beginning, for you 
You who have conquered the world ? 

Intimate friend of Home Tooke's, 
Chum of the Wandering Jew, 

Rating reformers as " crooks " 

And lovers as enfants perdus, 
Why should you ever pursue 

Ways of the folk who are swirled 
Into the popular view, 

You who have conquered the world ? 

Envoy. 

Dream, as you ruminate through 
Smoke into canopies curled ; 

Dream, for you 've nothing to do, 
You who have conquered the world. 

A RONDEAU IN REPLY. 

In fallow fields I long to lie 

A bookman lost in Arcady ; 

Or, steeped in grasses to the knees, 
To follow fast where fancy flees, 

Though musty lore and legend die. 

I 'd give my conquered world to sigh 

An answer to the lullaby 

Hot-humm'd by honey-laden bees, 
In fallow fields. 

A-dream 'neath circumambient sky,, 

To list the crow's remoter cry, 

The while the love-begetting breeze 
Flutters the leafy hearts of trees, 

And turns the heads of foolish rye 
In fallow fields.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

CONCERNING LITERARY ART. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The remarks of Mr. John Burroughs and Mrs. Celia 
Parker Woolley, in THE DIAL for Oct. 16, are whole- 
some and instructive, and I do not appear here as a 
critic of either of them; but there is a word still to be 
said, and I make this attempt to say it. 

There is some legitimate reason for a debate always 
going on over the value of art as such, or art as an end 
especially in literature. The debate arises out of the 
challenge to our admiration by an art which is only 
form, proportion, rhythm. It is bare justice to say that 
such art is rare. The poems of the English Swinburne 
and the American Poe are marked examples of this 
kind of art, wherein the claims of the letter are exalted 
above those of the spirit. But surely Shakespeare and 
Milton are as perfect in form, as rich in music ; and 
yet no one thinks of their art as defective in humanity 
or empty of thought and emotion. 

Art is an end in itself; nothing within the scope of 
human achievement is better worth living and dying for. 
But art cannot be mere form and music. The form and 
music express the human soul, or they fall short; and 
of course the soul of the artist must be capable of living 
the sound thought and emotion which require perfect 
form and perfect music for their adequate expression. 
Still, on the other hand, a poet may have a sound hu- 
man heart, large, manly, and consecrated, and by sing- 
ing false just miss the highest achievement. Surely 
Whittier's grammatical and orthoepical shortcomings 
mar the effect of his richly emotional conceptions. Nor 
can we accept in any case evidence of high thought and 
strong feeling, however true both may be, as proof of 
great artistic powers. We want both the form and the 
content, the letter and the spirit, the feeling and its lyr- 
ical body. It would be an immense misfortune if a 
generation should arise to flout and neglect the forms 
of good art. I think it is a saying of Wordsworth that 
the matter of writing comes very much out of the manner 
of it. Literature cannot " be real and strong and vital " 
except within the fences of sober and graceful form. 
We are not yet healed of wounds inflicted by some con- 
spicuous violations of the formal demands of art. " New 
ideals " are always old ideals re-born. Homer, Dante, 
Virgil, Milton, Longfellow, all worked in the harness 
of their art, and they live on unforgettable because they 
said better than forgotten men could say the everlasting 
truth of life and action. Let us hope that we are not, 
in the West, to be tortured by a replica of the old cant 
about new art, or by an apostolate of noble writing 
without correct writing, or by appeals to our admiration 
for lame verse or ungrammatical prose. 

To express both the mind and heart of man that is 
the purpose of literary art. And such expression, in prose 
or verse, is an end whenever the thought and feel- 
ing have soundness and universality. What Clara Jane 
feels is worthy of literary expression only when her feel- 
ing is broadly human. If it were only Clara Jane laugh- 
ing or crying, no one would care for the story of it. 
And if this maiden's joy or grief is worth expressing, 
it is worth expressing in the best possible form. In the 
strict sense of things, no new expression of it is possible : 
whoever does it in the best way, the immortal fashion, 
will do it as Shakespeare would have done it. 

With all this, I affirm that human service, the further- 
ance of righteous ends, the practical helping of men and 



women, must follow from the creation of good art in 
letters. I count Shakespeare in the front rank of ben- 
efactors. He enlightens and consoles all who really 
know him; and that may be a higher service than se- 
curing votes for any cause. j) jj WHEELER.

NEWSPAPERS AND THEIR CONSTITUENCIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With President Adams, whose pertinent communica- 
tion appears in your latest issue, and no doubt with 
many others, I have watched with interest the com- 
ments and discussions appearing in your columns of late 
anent the deplorable level of the newspaper of to-day. 

I believe I get the best Chicago daily print yet I 
am not at all proud of it ! I am ready to commend the 
spirit of energy the wonderful force and activity de- 
monstrated in the issuance of the progressive paper of 
to-day; but I regret that this energy is not more directed 
toward the better ethics of a higher humanity. 

President Adams's apology is all very true humiliat- 
ingly so, it seems to me that the cosmopolitan press is 
as high as its constituency, and no higher. And do we not 
here find a sufficient reason for the lost " power of the 
press " ? 

An intellectual leader must be above those he leads; 
the moment he is not, he ceases to be a leader. 

Granting that the newspaper of the period is a true 
index of the intellectual and moral tone of the masses, 
is it meet that such a standard should obtain, even 
though strongly upheld by the powerful influences of 
commercialism ? Are there not still, in Anglo-Saxon 
blood, the virtues of honorable example, high impulse, 
and a spirit of progressive emulation ? And if so, must 
they ever be subverted to, and hidden by, pennyism 
and poundism ? 

I cannot think a wisely-conducted movement in the 
better direction would be cheerless.

A WORTHY JOURNAL. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The Internationales Archivfiir Ethnographic, now clos- 
ing its sixth year, is the only undertaking of its kind. Truly 
international in character, it prints articles in any one of 
the four languages English, French-, German, Dutch. 
It has been under an able editorial committee of ethno- 
graphers of many countries, with Mr. J. D. E. Schmeltz 
as active editor. The articles published have been 
written by authorities and possess great value, while 
the illustrations have been extremely fine. As it was 
never self-supporting, the publisher, Mr. Trapp, of Ley- 
den, Holland, decided to discontinue the publication at 
the end of this year. Ethnographers of all countries, 
however, have urged its continuance, and the firm of 
E. J. Brill also of Leyden will probably undertake 
the work. The Editorial Committee, through Mr. J. 
D. E. Schmeltz, appeal for assistance. An encouraging 
response has been made by governments, societies, and 
private individuals. The Archiv is but little known in 
America, but it deserves our help. It is desirable that 
all our public libraries should subscribe for it ($5. per 
year), and that a few at least of our wealthy men may 
become patrons ($10. per year for five years). Some 
help from us is properly asked for such an international

JjOWELI/S TjETTERS.* 



Professor Norton's edition of " The Letters 
of James Russell Lowell " is at last before us, 
and our rather rapid inspection of the work 
serves to confirm its a-priori claim to rank as 
the leading book of the year. That it has 
been put forth comparatively unheralded is a 
fact not perhaps unworthy of note. There have 
been no preliminary flourishes of newspaper 
trumpets, no advance tributes from known bell- 
wethers of opinion, no unworthy lures in the 
form of hints as to " disclosures " or other 
" racy " matters to be looked for in the inti- 
mate correspondence of our leading man of let- 
ters. Merit, in short, has been trusted to win 
its own way with a public too lightly held to 
be pecuniarily proof against it. 

Professor Norton's work is an admirable 
piece of literary construction a model of 
painstaking and strictly impersonal editing. 
The letters are divided into eleven chapters, 
each marking in a general way an epoch in 
Mr. Lowell's life ; the arrangement of the 
whole is chronological, and editorial writing is 
confined to the briefest of notes and to the sup- 
plying, in the first four chapters, of leading 
biographical facts. It has been the editor's 
aim, in making his selection from the great 
mass of Mr. Lowell's letters, " to secure for it, 
so far as possible, an autobiographic charac- 
ter." In this he has been eminently success- 
ful. No similar collection with which we are 
acquainted comes so near to being a complete, 
satisfactory " Life " of the writer. We need 
scarcely say that Professor Norton has made 
no editorial concessions to mere vulgar curios- 
ity. " There was," he says, " nothing in Mr. 
Lowell's life to be concealed or excused. But 
he had the reserves of a high and delicate 
nature, reserves to be no less respected after 
death than during life, and nothing will, I hope, 
be found in these volumes which he himself 
might have regretted to see in print." 

The series of letters extends from 1827 to 
1891, beginning with the artless essay of the 
child of eight, and closing with the half humor- 
ous plaint of the failing man with whom life 
is a retrospect, and whose chief concern seems 
to be to husband out its taper at the close. 
They form, as we have said, a remarkably com-

York : Harper & Bros. 



plete biographical record ; yet in one point 
they seem curiously lacking. Rich as they are 
in criticism of men, of letters, of current events 
and issues, we find little in them of the deeper 
criticism of life, little to indicate that the 
writer gave (as we all know he did give) its 
gravest problems a serious thought. It may 
be partly with reference to this reserve that 
Professor Norton says in his preface : 

" Mr. Lowell, indeed, made to the public in his po- 
etry such revelation of his inward experiences and emo- 
tions as he alone had the right to make, and such as 
may well suffice to satisfy all legitimate interest in the 
spiritual development of the poet and in the nature of 
his most intimate and sacred human relations. Read 
together, his poems and his letters show him with rare 
completeness as he truly was." 

Perhaps Mr. Lowell thought speculations as to 
the " woher, wozu, undwohin" out of place in let- 
ters to one's friends ; but the fact remains that 
the impression one gets from the letters, taken 
by themselves, is that of a man whose interests 
were, in the best sense, of the world worldly. 

The present collection cannot perhaps be bet- 
ter characterized than by saying that it fulfils 
anticipation. Since its announcement by the 
publishers, expectancy has been on the qui- 
vive; and no one, we think that is, no one 
whose tastes are wholesome and whose opinion 
counts is likely to be disappointed. In range 
of topic, richness of literary criticism and allu- 
sion, and in penetration and large-mindedness 
of political judgments, the letters are such as 
no American save Mr. Lowell himself could 
have written. The aim of this review will be 
best served, and our remaining space be most 
profitably filled, by letting the letters speak, so 
far as possible, for themselves. 

The references to Poe, in a letter written in 
1845 to C. F. Briggs of " The Broadway Jour- 
nal," are interesting : 

"... Poe, I am afraid, is wholly lacking in that ele- 
ment of manhood which, for want of a better name, 
we call character. It is something quite distinct from 
genius though all great geniuses are endowed with it. 
... As I prognosticated, I have made Poe my enemy 
by doing him a service. In the last ' Broadway Jour- 
nal ' he has accused me of plagiarism, and misquoted 
Wordsworth to sustain his charge. . . . Poe wishes to 
kick down the ladder by which he rose. He is welcome. 
But he does not attack me at a weak point. He proba- 
bly 'cannot conceive of anybody's writing for anything 
but a newspaper reputation, or for posthumous fame, 
which is but the same thing magnified by distance. I 
have quite other aims." 

The nature of Mr. Lowell's aims and his 
ideal of the poet's function are indicated in the 
following noble passage in a letter written early 
in 1846 : 



292 



[Nov. 16, 



"... My calling is clear to me. I am never lifted 
up to any peak of vision and moments of almost fear- 
ful illumination I have sometimes but that, when I 
look down in hope to see some valley of the Beautiful 
Mountains, I behold nothing but blackened ruins; and 
the moans of the down-trodden the world over but 
chiefly here in our own land come up to my ear, in- 
stead of the happy songs of the husbandmen reaping 
and binding the sheaves of light; yet these, too, I hear 
not seldom. Then I feel how great is the office of poet, 
could I but even dare to hope to fill it. Then it seems 
as if my heart would break in pouring out one glorious 
song that should be the gospel of Reform, full of con- 
solation and strength to the oppressed, yet falling gently 
and restoringly as dew on the withered youth-flowers of 
the oppressor. That way my madness lies, if any. 
Were I to hang my harp (if we moderns may keep the 
metaphor, at least, of the old poets after losing their 
spirit) on a tree surrounded only by the very sweetest 
influence of summer nature, and the wind should breathe 
through its strings, I believe they would sound with a 
warlike clang." 

Brave words ! though, it must be confessed, 
words of very moderate fulfilment. It is scarcely 
as the Tyrtasus of down-trodden humanity that 
we are accustomed to think of the writer. That 
reputation even " newspaper reputation," the 
despised ideal of characterless Poe was not 
indifferent to him, is manifest in an earlier series 
of letters to G. B. Loring : 

"... I am going to write a tragedy. I have the 
plot nearly filled out. I think I know it will be good. 
It will be psycho - historical. I think also of writing a 
prose tale, which perhaps will appear in chapters in the 
('Southern Literary) Messenger' if White will pay 
me. . . . If I do n't die, George, you will be proud of 
me. I will DO somewhat. ... I shall print my volume. 
Maria wishes me to do it, and that is enough. I had 
become tired of the thought of it. ' Irene ' has gath- 
ered good opinions from many. / am beginning to be a 
lion." 

" My book does as well as can be expected. All the 
notices of it have been very favorable except that of 
your honest friend and fellow-politician, the editor of 
the < Post,' who blackguarded me roundly." 

In a letter to the editor, dated 1867, Mr. 
Lowell gives his impressions of Emerson : 

"Emerson's oration" (before the Phi Beta Kappa 
Society) "was more disjointed than usual, even with 
him. It began nowhere and ended everywhere, and 
yet, as always with that divine man, it left you feeling 
that something beautiful had passed that way some- 
thing more beautiful than anything else, like the rising 
and setting of stars. Every possible criticism might 
have been made on it but one that it was not noble. 
There was a tone in it that awakened all elevating asso- 
ciations. He boggled, he lost his place, he had to put 
on his glasses; but it was as if a creature from some 
fairer world had lost its way in our fogs, and it was our 
fault, not his. It was chaotic, but it was all such stuff 
as stars are made of, and you could n't help feeling that, 
if you waited awhile, all that was nebulous would be 
whirled into planets, and would assume the mathemat- 
ical gravity of system. All through it I felt something in 
me that cried < Ha, ha, to the sound of the trumpets! '" 



Emerson once told Mr. Lowell a droll story 
of Alcott : 

" He (Emerson) asked the Brahmin what he had to 
show for himself, what he had done, in short, to justify 
his having been on the earth. ' If Pythagoras came to 
Concord, whom would he wish to see ? ' demanded the 
accused triumphantly." 

In a letter to James B. Thayer, dated 1883, 
Mr. Lowell, after noting Emerson's singular 
insensibility to the harmony of verse, says of 
his prose : 

" I liked particularly what you say about his mastery 
of English. No man, in my judgment, ever had a 
greater, and I greatly doubt whether Matthew Arnold 
is quite capable (in the habit of addressing a jury as 
he always is) of estimating the style of one who con- 
versed with none but the masters of his mother-tongue. 
Emerson's instinct for the best word was infallible. 
Whenever he found one he froze to it, as we say in our 
admirable vernacular. I have sometimes found that he 
had added to his cabinet the one good word in a book 
he had read. ... I think that Matthew Arnold, like 
Renan (who has had an evil influence over him), is apt 
to think the super&ne as good as the fine, or even bet- 
ter than that." 

The letters are rich in personal allusions and 
characterizations, and the only case in which 
the writer's good temper seems to desert him 
is in a note on Margaret Fuller : 

" She is a very foolish, conceited woman, who has got 
together a great deal of information, but not enough 
knowledge to save her from being ill-tempered." 

President Hayes and his wife fare better : 
"... Mrs. Hayes also pleased me very much. She 
has really beautiful eyes, full of feeling and intelligence, 
and bore herself with a simple good -humor that was 
perfectly well-bred. A very good American kind of 
princess, I thought. Do n't fancy I am taken off my 
feet by the enthusiasm of contagion. You know I am 
only too fastidious, and am too apt to be put at a dis- 
advantage by the impartiality of my eyes. No, I am 
sure that both the President and his wife have in them 
that excellent new thing we call Americanism, which I 
suppose is that ' dignity of human "nature ' which the 
philosophers of the last century were always seeking and 
never finding, and which, after all, consists, perhaps, in 
not thinking yourself either better or worse than your 
neighbors by reason of any artificial distinction. As I 
sat behind them at the concert the other night, I was 
profoundly touched by the feeling of this kingship with- 
out mantle and crown from the property-room of the 
old world. Their dignity was in their very neighborli- 
ness, instead of in their distance, as in Europe." 

Regarding President Cleveland, Mr. Lowell 
wrote, in 1887, to Mr. E. W. Gilder : " To me 
his personality is very simpatico. He is a 
truly American type of the best kind a type 
very dear to me, I confess." Another refer- 
ence to the President, in a letter written 
shortly after the writer's political " decapita- 
tion" in 1885, is worth quoting: 

" Cleveland I liked, but saw only for half an hour. 
I told him that I came to him like St. Denis, with the

head he had cut off under my arm, at which piece of 
humor he laughed heartily and I think, on the whole, 
was not sorry he should be represented in England by 
somebody else." 

A letter to Professor Norton from London, 
1888, contains a very characteristic passage 
touching the famous Sackville incident : 

" The Sackville squall has amused me a good deal, 
bringing out so strangely as it did the English genius 
for thinking the rest of mankind unreasonable. One is 
reminded of the old story of the madman who thought 
himself alone in his sanity. I seldom care to discuss 
anything most things seem so obvious, least of all 
with the average Briton, who never is willing to take any- 
thing for granted and whose eyes are blind to all side- 
lights. Yes, there is one thing they always take for 
granted, namely, that an American must see the supe- 
riority of England. They have as little tact as their 
totem the bull. I have come to the edge of my temper 
several times over the Sackville business always in- 
troduced by them. 'All Europe is laughing at you, 

you know,' said Sir to me genially the other 

day. ' That is a matter of supreme indifference to us,' 
I replied blandly, though with a keen temptation to pull 
a pair of ears so obtrusively long. But with all that 
there is a manliness about them I heartily like. Tact, 
after all, is only a sensitiveness of nerve, and there is 
but a hair's-breadth between this and irritability." 

As an example of the lighter vein in which 
many of the letters are written, we subjoin a 
note written from Dresden, in 1856, to Dr. 
Estes Howe : 

" The greatest event that has recently taken place 
here I will relate. There are Court Balls once a fort- 
night which Dr. Reichenbach is expected to attend, and 
also to attend in uniform. This uniform (Madame be- 
ing a wonderful housekeeper) is packed carefully as soon 
as he comes home, to await its next day of service. The 
trousers are of white broadcloth, and these are care- 
fully turned inside out. Now, you must know, that if 
our dear Doctor gets to thinking of any point in Natural 
History particularly if he has heard of. a new hum- 
ming-bird he becomes wholly unconscious of the out- 
ward world. For this reason he is obliged to pass in 
review before Madame when he is going anywhere a 
ceremony he is a little impatient under and tries to es- 
cape from in a blind, blundering kind of way, like one 
of his own beetles. On the occasion in question he was 
interrupted by Madame, just as he was triumphantly 
setting forth with his cocked hat under his arm, his ra- 
pier at his side, and his trousers on wrong side out, 
the pockets fluttering on each hip as if the herald Mer- 
cury had buckled his talaria on too high up ! Fancy his 
arrival at the palace and his obeisance to majesty ! " 

Having given the reader a foretaste of the 
" Letters," it remains to say that the publish- 
ers have given them a suitable setting two 
noble octavos that, in point of print, paper, and 
general finish and appearance, are up to the 
standards of the best foreign book-making. The 
three portraits in photogravure of Mr. Lowell 
are excellent examples of the process.

AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.* 



The reputation of the public-school system 
of the United States has hitherto received no 
such damaging blow as that dealt by Dr. J. M. 
Rice in a series of articles published in " The 
Forum " from October, 1892, to June, 1893. 
These articles were received with much sur- 
prise by a large part of the public, naively con- 
fident until now that American schools, like 
American pork and sewing-machines, were 
the best in the world. In public-school circles 
they created no little indignation, together with 
a certain amount of consternation. The arti- 
cles have now appeared in book form, with the 
addition of a second part illustrating some of 
the excellent work done by pupils in the schools 
of Minneapolis, La Porte, Indianapolis, and in 
the Cook County (111.) Normal School ; these 
schools, even in the author's critical judgment, 
being really good. 

Dr. Rice, who is a specialist in pedagogy and 
has personally inspected the schools of Ger- 
many and other European countries, undertook, 
with the support of " The Forum," a tour of 
visitation of the schools in the principal cities 
of this country. Thirty-six cities in all were 
visited, the tour consuming twenty-four weeks, 
during which, with few exceptions, every school 
hour was spent in school-rooms. In his pub- 
lished review of these schools, Dr. Rice is 
severe where severe criticism is necessary, laud- 
atory where praise is possible, and always con- 
structive as well as destructive. When the 
schools are bad he shows us where in his opin- 
ion the source of the evil lies and how it may 
be remedied. He found that a surprisingly 
large proportion of the cities which he visited 
have poor schools. A poor school is one in 
which the present happiness of the child is not 
considered ; where purely mechanical and mem- 
oriter methods are permitted ; and where mere 
familiarity with words and forms and facts is 
accepted for education. A good school is one 
where the child is taught to observe, to think, 
and to do ; where reading, writing, and arith- 
metic are taught interestingly in connection 
with natural science ; where the child is happy 
and the teacher enthusiastic ; where discipline 
is by love ; and where the child is allowed 
physically and mentally to expand. To the first 
class belong for the most part the schools of 
New York City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Buf- 
falo, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, Milwau-

apolis, Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the 
grammar-schools of Boston. Of intermediate 
character are the schools of other cities visited 
but reported less in detail. The author sup- 
ports his opinion of the above schools by a 
convincing array of his actual observations. 
Instances of unscientific and even barbarous 
teaching that he cites cannot be excused as ex- 
ceptions, first, because there are too many of 
them ; and, second, because " the degree of 
excellence of a school system is represented, not 
by what is done by those teachers who are suf- 
ficiently interested to do more than is required 
of them, but by the degree of inferiority that 
the teaching may reach and yet be accepted as 
satisfactory." 

A school in New York City, whose principal 
has been marked uniformly " excellent " every 
year for the last twenty-five years, is described 
in part as follows : 

" The principal of this school has pedagogical views 
and a maxim peculiarly her own. She believes that 
when a child enters upon school-life, his vocabulary is 
so small that it is practically worthless, and his power 
to think so feeble that his thoughts are worthless. She 
is consequently of the opinion that what the child knows 
and is able to do on coming to school should be entirely 
disregarded; that he should not be allowed to waste 
time, either in thinking or in finding his own words to 
express his thoughts, but that he should be supplied with 
ready-made thoughts as given in a ready-made vocabu- 
lary. She has therefore prepared sets of questions and 
answers, so that the child may be given in concise form 
most of the facts prescribed in the course of study for 
the three years of primary instruction. The instruction 
throughout the school consists principally of grinding 
these answers verbatim into the minds of the children. 
The principal's ideal lies in giving each child the ability 
to answer without hesitation, upon leaving her school, 
every one of the questions formulated by her. In order 
to reach the desired end, the school has been converted 
into the most dehumanizing institution that I have ever 
laid eyes upon, each child being treated as if he pos- 
sessed a memory and the faculty of speech, but no in- 
dividuality, no sensibilities, no soul. 

" So much concerning the pedagogical views on which 
this school is conducted; now as to the maxim. This 
maxim consists of three short words ' Save the min- 
utes.' The spirit of the school is, ' Do what you like 
with the child, immobilize him, automatize him, dehu- 
manize him, but save, save the minutes.' In many 
ways the minutes are saved. By giving the child ready- 
made thoughts, the minutes required in thinking are 
saved. By giving the child ready-made definitions, the 
minutes required in formulating them are saved. Every- 
thing is prohibited that is of no measurable advantage 
to the child, such as the movement of the head or a 
limb, when there is no logical reason why it should be 
moved at the time. I asked the principal whether the chil- 
dren were not allowed to move their heads. She answer- 



ed, 'Why should they look behind when the teacher is 
in front of them ? ' words too logical to be refuted. 

" During the recitations many minutes are saved. 
The principal has indeed solved the problem of how the 
greatest number of answers may be given in the small- 
est number of minutes. In the first place, no time is 
spent in selecting pupils to answer questions, every reci- 
tation being started by the first pupil in the class, the 
children then answering in turn, until all have recited. 
Secondly, time is economized in the act of rising and 
sitting during the recitations, the children being so 
drilled that the child who recites begins to fall back 
into his seat while uttering the last word of a definition, 
the next succeeding child beginning his ascent while the 
one before him is in the act of descending. Indeed, 
things appear as if the two children occupying adjoin- 
ing seats were sitting upon the opposite poles of an in- 
visible see-saw, so that the descending child necessarily 
raises the pupil next him to his feet. Then, again, the 
minutes are saved by compelling the children to unload 
their answers as rapidly as possible, distinctness of ut- 
terance being sacrificed to speed, and to scream their 
answers at the tops of their voices, so that no time may 
be wasted in repeating words inaudibly uttered. For 
example, the principal's definition of a note ' A note 
is a sign representing to the eye the length or duration 
of time' is ideally delivered, when it sounds some- 
thing like ' Notsinrepti length d'ration time.' " 

Truly, in such processes the minutes are 
saved, but the soul of the child is lost. The 
above is typical of many schools visited in New 
York and other cities. In New York City the 
cause of the inferiority of the schools is appar- 
ent. The appointment of teachers is a matter 
of political " jobbery," and a teacher once in, 
be she good or evil, is in to stay. If she pos- 
sesses any kind of " pull " at all, her removal 
is practically impossible. Then the supervis- 
ion is very scanty one superintendent with 
only eight assistants to supervise the work of 
four thousand teachers. Finally, the people 
at large take no active interest in their schools. 

In Baltimore things were worse. Khyth- 
mical concert recitations of abstract numbers 
passed for instruction in arithmetic. Reading 
was purely mechanical, often without expres- 
sion, inflection, or even a pause at a comma or 
period. Here are two gems from this city : 

" I asked one of the primary principals whether she 
believed in the professional training of teachers. ' I do 
not,' she answered emphatically. ' I speak from expe- 
rience. A graduate of the Maryland Normal School 
once taught under me, and she was n't as good a teacher 
as those who came from the High School.' 

"One of the primary teachers said to me: 'I for- 
merly taught in the higher grades, but I had an attack 
of nervous prostration some time ago, and the doctor 
recommended rest. So I now teach in the primary, be- 
cause teaching primary children does not tax the mind.' " 

And yet the citizens of Baltimore glory in the 
fact that their schools are among the best in 
the country.

From the several accounts of irrational teach- 
ing at Buffalo and Cincinnati, we quote only a 
part of a spelling-lesson at Buffalo : 

" The teacher here remarked, ' We will now write the 
words.' 

" This announcement was followed by a considerable 
amount of bustle and confusion on the part of the chil- 
dren, and order was not restored until slates, pencils, 
and rulers had been placed in position. When all was 
quiet one of the pupils called out: 

"'I ain't got no ruler.' 

" In answer to this, the teacher, without correcting 
or even paying the slightest attention to the incorrect 
language that had been used by the child, said to him: 

" ' You don't need a ruler. Do it the way you done 
it yesterday.' 

" Then the words of the oft-repeated list were slowly 
dictated by the teacher. When the word ' steal ' was 
reached, she remarked: 

" ' Spell the " steal " you spelled this morning, not the 
"steel" you spelled yesterday.' 

" When the word ' their ' was reached, the teacher 
asked, ' How do you spell " their " ? ' 

" ' T-h-e-i-r their,' sang the children. 

" ' What kind of a " t " do you use in their ? ' 

" Capital " t," ' one of the pupils answered. 

" ' That 's right,' said the teacher. 

" One of the children here remarked, melodiously: 




"/ can't make no cap - i tal t." 



"/ kin " 
sang another. 

" Here the teacher said to me, ' They do n't use capi- 
tal letters regularly in this class; I only let them use 
capitals when they write proper names and proper 
things.' " 

That the schools of America have not yet 
wholly passed out of the stage of barbarism, 
the following from St. Louis will show : 

" During several daily recitation periods, each of which 
is from twenty to twenty-five minutes in duration, the 
children are obliged to stand on the line, perfectly mo- 
tionless, their bodies erect, their knees and feet together, 
the tips of their shoes touching the edge of a board in 
the floor. The slightest movement on the part of a 
child attracts the attention of the teacher. The recita- 
tion is repeatedly interrupted with cries of ' Stand 
straight,' 'Don't bend the knees,' 'Don't lean against 
the wall,' and so on. I heard one teacher ask a little 
boy, ' How can you learn anything with your knees and 
toes out of order ? ' The toes appear to play a more 
important part than the reasoning faculties. The teacher 
never forgets the toes; every few moments she casts her 
eyes ' toe- ward.' " 

Although the schools of Chicago belong to 
the mechanical and unscientific order, and al- 
though in some of them the author found the 
most absurd teaching and pedagogical " meth- 
ods of the most ancient type," yet under the 



present superintendent he sees promise of bet- 
ter things. The principal cause of the low 
standard of the Chicago schools is a lack of 
professional strength on the part of the teach- 
ers. As remedies, he suggests professional 
training-schools for the preparation of new 
teachers, and educational supervision for the 
three thousand teachers at present employed. 
Of the Chicago schools in general, Dr. Rice 
says : 

" The amount of objective work is extremely limited, 
even in the lower grades, and the sciences are not in- 
cluded in the curriculum. In the lowest primary grade 
the work is particularly dry and mechanical. With the 
exception of a little singing, the pupils during the first 
six months do nothing but read, write, and cipher all 
day long. There is not even a recess to break the mo- 
notony. Owing to lack of accommodation in the rap- 
idly-growing districts, a number of the primaries have 
been converted into half-day schools, some of the pu- 
pils attending in the morning, while others attend in the 
afternoon. In some of the half-day schools the pupils 
do not even cipher during the first six months, all their 
time being devoted to reading and writing. The busy- 
work consists largely of copying words either from a 
book or from the board. The methods employed in 
teaching reading vary in the different schools. In some 
instances the pupils are taught by the word method, in 
others by the sentence method, and in still others by a 
variety of methods, including phonics and word build- 
ing. As a rule, I found the reading and the writing in 
the lower grades poor, in spite of the fact that so much 
time had been devoted to these subjects." 

The schools of St. Paul are described, to 
show how quickly good schools may be built 
up when the superintendent is acquainted with 
modern pedagogical methods and is enthusias- 
tic, and when the school management is sep- 
arated from politics. The course of study here 
is based on the principle of unification, by 
which is meant such a combination of the 
branches pursued at one time that each shall 
contribute to the interest and understanding of 
the other. The following example will serve as 
an illustration : The young child, upon entering 
the primary department, begins, not the study 
of reading and writing, but some natural sci- 
ence, say botany, in a simple and interesting 
way ; and in connection with this, apparently 
as an incident, learns to read, and write, and 
draw, and to use numbers. He counts the 
flower's petals, he draws its form upon paper, 
he describes it in oral and written words, and 
he reads its printed description. At the same 
time the child is encouraged to observe objects 
of nature and their changes and to report his 
observations, to think about them and to re- 
cord his thoughts. The following composition, 
written by a child who had attended a St. Paul 
primary school only seven months, is one of

many equally good. The observations were his 
own. 

" I have a pasque flower. The stamens are yellow. 
The stem is short. There are many stamens. My 
flower wears an overcoat." 

In the schools of Minneapolis it is shown 
how a child may be educated without putting 
him in a straight- jacket or depriving him of 
his natural rights. Here, too, it is shown how, 
with enthusiastic teachers and interested pu- 
pils, the number of subjects taught in the pri- 
mary grades may be greatly enlarged, and yet 
at the end of a given time the children be more 
proficient in the three R's than by the old nar- 
row mechanical method. It is further shown 
in Minneapolis how the children of poor immi- 
grants may, by joining love and sympathy with 
a little pedagogical science, be taught to speak 
and read without the contortions and grimaces 
practised in some of the Bohemian schools in 
Chicago. One of the problems of the primary 
teacher is what to have the children do while 
she is engaged with other children. In the 
mechanical schools the " busywork " consists 
in the drudgery of copying over and over a set 
form of words, or in writing again and again 
such nonsense as 00 + 000 = 00000, or in the 
soul-deadening process of " studying " when 
eyes and lips are following the printed page 
with interest and attention absent. In the few 
good schools which Dr. Rice discovered, the 
busywork was not of this kind, but the child was 
engaged in something to awaken his thought, to 
sustain his interest, or to train his hand. 

In a word, the trouble with the schools of 
the United States seems to be poorly qualified 
teachers. And the cause of this trouble is three- 
fold : first, a lack of active interest in the pub- 
lic schools on the part of the public ; second, 
political considerations in the appointment of 
teachers ; third, the want of adequate super- 
vision. In any city these causes may be re- 
moved. In some cities this has been accom- 
plished, and the result has been an improve- 
ment that was wonderful indeed. In recent 
times the science of education has so far ad- 
vanced that it needs only favorable objective 
conditions to vindicate its power. The board 
of education must be severed from politics ; 
the superintendent who, it is hardly neces- 
sary to say, must be a scientist in pedagogy 
should have power to secure the election of 
qualified teachers and the dismissal of unqual- 
ified ones ; he must, furthermore, have assist- 
ants enough to provide for thorough supervis- 
ion of all the schools and teachers, a part of 



this supervision to be educational, that is, the 
teachers themselves must, by means of teach- 
ers' meetings, classes, and clubs, be brought up 
and kept up to a high educational standard. 

We have nothing but praise for Dr. Rice's 
book. It is healthfully stimulating throughout. 
It is true that a still more radical standard of 
criticism of our prevalent educational principles 
is needed, but at present we are not far enough 
along to profit by such criticism. Could we 
lift ourselves up to the standard set forth in 
this work, we might get strength of mind to 
look farther. Then a new prophet will be timely, 
who shall ask us hard questions about some of 
the fundamental articles of our orthodox peda- 
gogical faith. Perchance he shall ask us why 
we ever considered that the first and chiefest 
studies in our school curriculum should be read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and geography ; by 
what authority we made instruction in music, 
morals, conversation, natural science, and phys- 
ical and manual training subordinate to these ; 
why we took it for granted that the great ma- 
jority of public-school teachers must be women ; 
why we never doubted that the little ones must 
sit for consecutive hours in straight rows, 
pinned in between a wooden seat and desk ; 
why we believed that a school should be con- 
ducted wholly indoors ; and why, finally, we 
approved mainly of the plan of learning les- 
sons from a printed book and reciting them to 
a teacher. Before such a prophet, perchance, 
we shall stand with fear and trembling, unable 
to give a reason for the faith that is in us.

BOOK-HUXTERS AND THEIR VAGARIES.* 



" Books about books " are multiplying so 
rapidly in England that it can hardly be said 
there much longer that twenty such works come 
from France for every one produced at home. 
One of the most entertaining and perhaps 
useful of its class is the pretty volume enti- 
tled " The Great Book Collectors," written by 
Charles and Mary Elton, who, if we mistake 
not, are themselves among the most intelligent 
and indefatigable book-collectors in England 
to-day. So Mr. and Mrs. Elton bring much 
practical knowledge, as well as a ready sympa- 
thy, to their subject ; and very scholarly do 
they make their book too much so, perhaps, 
for the young American book-hunter, who cares

little for books or names dating back of the 
present century : but it is not for him alone 
that the book has been written. 

" Mighty Book-Hunters," Dr. Burton called 
his little clan ; and " mighty " collectors are 
marshalled in the Elton clan. We find here 
scarcely any mention of the present-day Glad- 
stones and Locker-Lampsons, but of those clas- 
sic fellows who "found time to discuss the mer- 
its of the authors before the Flood" we have a 
plenty. The great libraries once at the breast of 
the Sphinx and in the House of Serapis, and 
those on the site of Cairo and at Alexandria, as 
well as the one sent by Antony as a gift to Cleo- 
patra, are, with their founders, like the ladies of 
Villon's ballad, " gone with last year's snow." 
But of all these, and of many others besides, Mr. 
and Mrs. Elton give us much pleasant and in- 
structive gossip. " It pleased the Greeks to 
invent traditions about the books of Poly- 
crates," the tyrant of Samos who usurped the 
royal power about 532 B.C.; but the splendors 
of the private library began only about 100 
years B.C., in the days of Lucullus. Seneca, 
though a millionaire, complained bitterly of 
the pomp of Lucullus, and rejoiced at the de- 
struction of Alexandria's treasures. " Our idle 
book-hunters," he said, " know about nothing 
but titles and bindings ; their chests of cedar 
and ivory, and the book-cases that fill the bath- 
room, are nothing but fashionable furniture, 
and have nothing to do with learning." The 
Roman stoic would doubtless throw up his 
hands in holy horror at the contents of a Sher- 
aton Shrine, or M. James Rothschild's hun- 
dred books worth $200,000, yet find solace in 
our " bulged and bruised octavos " of to-day. 

Mr. and Mrs. Elton have grouped the great 
collectors of England, Italy, France, and Ger- 
many under several headings, and have brought 
together various schools, classified as " Royal 
Collectors," " Grolier and his Successors," 
44 De Thou Pinelli Peiresc," and the like. 
In the dark ages, when learning was at a low 
ebb, there were not many great collectors of 
books. "The knowledge of books might al- 
most have disappeared in the seventh century, 
when the cloud of ignorance was darkest, but 
for a new and remarkable development of learn- 
ing in the Irish monasteries." But the books 
of the monks, like those that had preceded 
them, were few and costly ; and although the 
collectors who lived and conducted their pious 
enterprises of hoarding the sacred memorials 
of their ancestors, from the seventh century 
down to the beginning of the sixteenth fifty 



years after the dawn of the art' of printing 
are brought together with scrupulous care by 
Mr. and Mrs. Elton, we do not find among 
them many names great from the point of view 
of a collector of to-day, with a signal excep- 
tion here and there, such as Richard de Bury, 
44 who had more books than all the other Bish- 
ops of England," until we reach Maioli and 
Grolier and De Thou, who are still the patron 
saints of those who love books for books' sake. 

When Pope Nicholas V., who came into 
power in 1447, founded the Vatican Library 
and endowed it with five thousand volumes, 
books were still worth their weight in precious 
stones. He opened his Greek treasure-house 
to the Western World, and gathered about 
him a set of scholars who were kept busy en- 
riching the world's store of knowledge. He 
obtained the " Commentary upon St. Mat- 
thew," of which Erasmus made use in his Par- 
aphrase, and of which Aquinas wrote that he 
44 would rather have a copy than be master of 
the city of Paris." Wanting to read Homer 
in Latin verse, and " to get a version of the 
Iliad and Odyssey, he gave a large retaining 
fee, a palazzo, and a farm in the Campagna, 
and made a deposit of ten thousand pieces of 
gold to be paid on the completion of the con- 
tract." Another great Italian collector was 
Antonio Magliabecchi, whose portrait has been 
engraved for Mr. and Mrs. Elton's book. Early 
in life a jeweller's shop-boy, who never left 
Florence, he in time became renowned through- 
out the world for his knowledge of books. His 
memory was so trustworthy and his information 
so exact that he was believed to know the hab- 
itat of all the rare books in the world ; yet he 
has been despised as " a man who lived on titles 
and indexes, and whose very pillow was a folio." 
He left to the library that bears his name about 
30,000 volumes of his own collecting. 

Germany had its early collectors also, among 
whom, to mention only two, were Pirckheimer 
(whose book-plate was engraved by Diirer) 
and Henri Estienne's friend Ulric Fugger, 
whose library was " said to contain as many 
books as there were stars in heaven." 

Among the great collectors in England are 
names more or less familiar to us from the 
libraries they founded Bodley, Harley, Sel- 
den, Cotton. But in France bibliophiles and 
collectors have, since the time of Grolier, been 
as numerous as the books in Ulric Fugger's 
library. One great French name seems to have 
fallen out of Mr. and Mrs. Elton's galaxy - 
that of the Comtesse de Verrue, who, what-

ever may have been her shortcomings morally, 
deserves to be mentioned along with the de 
Pompadours and other royal book-lovers. This 
lively dame left an epitaph on herself, thus 
rudely translated by Mr. Andrew Lang : 

"Here lies, in sleep secure, 

A dame inclined to mirth, 
Who, by way of making sure, 
Chose her paradise on earth." 

No book-collector has left behind him a name 
more revered in all ways than Jean Grolier, 
whose fame is due, however, not more to his 
love of literature than to his delicate and re- 
fined taste in the decoration of the covers of 
his books. " They looked," said one enthusiast, 
" as if the muses had taken the outsides into 
their charge, as well as the contents, they 
were adorned with such art and esprit, and 
looked so gay, with a delicate gilding quite 
unknown to the bookbinders of our time." 

The collectors of Spain embrace one great 
name of pertinent interest to our readers, that 
of Don Ferdinand, the son of Christopher Co- 
lumbus and Donna Beatrix Enriquez. He 
was one of the most celebrated bibliophiles in 
Europe, and the founder of the library at Se- 
ville, " La Columbina." This library is still 
in existence, and contains some of the books of 
the great admiral, which bear his marginal 
notes one of especial interest and value, the 
Imago Mundi, in which he wrote, anent the 
Portuguese discoveries, " in all which things I 
had my share." 

In Mr. and Mrs. Elton's scholarly book there 
is so much to praise that we hesitate to point 
out such small defects as typographical errors, 
but these (pp. 32 and 84) should disappear 
from subsequent editions ; and on pages 219 
and 220, Nicholas Jarry's name should be 
properly speUed. w> IRVING 



SALVINI'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 

More than ordinary interest attaches to the 
publication of the autobiography of a contem- 
poraneous artist like Tomasso Salvini, cel$- 
brated alike in the old world and the new. The 
appearance of this volume first in the English 
language, and its issue from an American pub- 
lishing house, attest Salvini's recognition of 
America's appreciation of the classic drama as 
interpreted by the foremost actor of his time. 
The dramatic art has overcome all obstacles 
and prejudices since the time of Shakespeare ; 

* LEAVES FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF TOMMASO SAL- 
VINI. New York : The Century Company. 



and in Salvini's case it has risen superior even 
to the limitation of language, for nowhere has 
he found more intelligent consideration than 
among the American people, to the mass of 
whom the language he speaks is entirely un- 
familiar. Of this he himself testifies through- 
out his book, which he practically closes with 
the following eloquent tribute : 

"As I left that hospitable land [America] behind 
me, and saw the great statue of Liberty fade gradually 
from my sight, I felt a pang in my soul, and, if my 
eyes were dry, my heart wept. I made a salute to that 
country whose people are so full of vigor, industry, and 
courage, and who lack neither culture nor understand- 
ing nor feeling. May the United States receive the 
salutation of a humble artist who while his heart beats 
will feel for that nation respect and love." 

There is perhaps a feeling of disappointment 
that Salvini's autobiography should follow so 
closely the form of a diary ; but probably this 
could not have been otherwise. Salvini is an 
actor, not a writer. At the same time, there is 
much compensation in the fact that this style 
reveals the characteristics of the man, which 
include notably vanity, generosity, persistence, 
concentration, and, above all, a spirit of justice 
to himself and others. " I have the conscience 
to confess," he says, " that I have not always 
risen to the height of my own conception. I 
have never had a more severe critic than my- 
self in matters pertaining to my art." Yet he 
recounts his numerous triumphs with an in- 
genuous glow of language which brings a smile 
to the lips of the reader. But as an insight 
into the character of the man who writes his 
own biography is the greatest favor he can con- 
fer upon his readers, Salvini's candor is rather 
commendable than blameworthy. It should 
also be noted that he writes of other great art- 
ists whom he has seen Ristori, Rossi, Rachel, 
Irving, Edwin Booth, and others in the same 
spirit of enthusiasm. 

He has kept in mind the purpose of doing 
some good with his book, for in many passages 
there is valuable advice to members of his pro- 
fession ; and in one place he says : 

" The chief object of these memoirs is to make it 
known to anyone whom it may aid, how a young man, 
without inherited resources, and constrained to look out 
for himself from very early years, can, by upright con- 
duct, firm resolution, and assiduous effort, acquire in 
time some renown and the means for enjoying the com- 
forts of life in his old age without being dependent on 
anybody." 

Among the most interesting parts of Sal- 
vini's book are those which relate to his own 
methods of study and delineation of character 
on the stage, to the various characteristics of 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



299 



the different schools of acting, and to the chief 
characteristics of the audiences he has met in 
remote parts of the globe. In speaking of his 
first attempts in the composite experiment of 
presenting his plays he speaking Italian and 
the others English he says : 

" The exactitude with which the subsequent rehears- 
als of ' Othello ' and those of ' Hamlet ' proceeded was 
due to the memory, the application, and the scrupulous 
attention of the American actors, as well as my own 
force of will, and to the natural intuition which helped 
me to know without understanding what was addressed 
to me, divining it from a motion, a look, or a light in- 
flection of the voice." 

Perhaps this and other testimonials to the mer- 
its of American actors, coming from such an 
exacting artist as Salvini, may persuade Amer- 
ican audiences to estimate more highly the 
American efforts in the dramatic art. Of 
American audiences in general, he says : 

" The theatrical audiences are serious, attentive to 
details, analytical I might almost say scientific, and 
one might fancy that such careful critics had never in 
their lives done anything but occupy themselves with 
scenic art. ... It is surprising that in a land where in- 
dustry and commerce seem to absorb all the intelligence 
of the people there should be in every city and district, 
indeed in every village, people who are competent to 
discuss the arts with such high authority. . . . The 
taste and critical faculty of the public are in their ful- 
ness of vigor. Old Europe is more bound by traditions, 
more weary, more blase, in her judgment, not always 
sincere or disinterested." 

Of the conscientious devotion which Salvini 
brought to his art, some notion may be formed 
from his treatment of a part which he had al- 
ready mastered as to words, character, and ac- 
tion. He says : 

" I wished, however, to avoid fixing an immature con- 
ception in my mind, and I let it lie for several months, 
so that I might form fresh impressions upon taking it 
up again. There is no better rule in art than not to 
permit one's self to be carried away by a first impulse. 
When time is taken for reflection, one's conceptions are 
always more correct." 

Again he says : 

" While I was busying myself with the part of Saul,' 
I read and reread the Bible, so as to become impreg- 
nated with the appropriate sentiments, manners, and 
local color. When I took up ' Othello ' I pored over 
the history of the Venetian Republic and that of the 
Moorish invasion of Spain; I studied the passions of 
the Moors, their art of war, their religious beliefs; nor 
did I overlook the romance of Giraldi Cinthio, in order 
the better to master that sublime character." 

In referring elsewhere to the Moor of Venice, 
he says : 

" It is very seldom that I have attained satisfaction 
with myself in that role I may say that in the thou- 
sands of times I have played it, I can count on the fingers 
of one hand those when 1 have said to myself, ' I can 
do no better.' " 



These brief extracts will be sufficient to reveal 
to the uninitiated that a great dramatic repre- 
sentation, which they enjoy for two or three 
hours of an idle evening, is frequently the re- 
sult of serious application for years on the part 
of the actor who entrances them. 

Salvini's accounts of the different receptions 
he has had at the hands of various audiences 
are very interesting. Of an Italian audience 
on a certain occasion, he writes : 

"Then came a tempest of cries and plaudits, and 
countless summonses before the curtain. When the 
demonstration was ended, the audience passed out amid 
the indistinct murmur of voices, and collected in groups 
of five, eight, or twelve, everywhere in the neighbor- 
hood of the theatre; then, reuniting as if by magnetic 
force, they came back into the theatre, demanded the 
relighting of the footlights, and insisted that I should 
come back on the stage again, though I was half un- 
dressed, to receive a new ovation." 

Of a South American public he writes: 

"When I reached the street two bands struck up, 
and a great shout of ' Viva Salvini ! ' arose from the 
throats of a crowd numbering thousands. The streets 
through which I was to pass were strewn with flowers, 
the windows were hung with draperies, and filled with 
ladies and children, who threw down flowers; as to the 
men, they were either in the procession or standing at 
the doors of their houses, holding their hats in the air 
and shouting." 

But these wild manifestations are not confined 
to the Latin races. Of a Russian audience 
Salvini says that it demands the appearance 
of a successful actor before the curtain " fifteen, 
twenty, or even thirty times," and he adds : 

" Not content with that, they wait for you at the door, 
no matter how long it may take you to dress, and stand 
in lines before you for you to pass between, begging a 
look, or a touch of your hand ; and, if you live so near 
by as not to need a carriage, they accompany you on 
foot to the door of your lodgings, with open manifesta- 
tions of sympathy." 

All of which is very strange to the more 
phlegmatic American audience, even at the 
greatest height of enthusiasm. But there is 
much significance in Salvini's further observa- 
tion : " The Russian is courteous, hospitable, 
liberal to the actor ; but, like all those whose 
enthusiasm exceeds due bounds, he forgets eas- 
ily." No American who has once seen Tom- 
maso Salvini in " Othello" or " Civile Morte " 
can ever forget him. JAMS R RuNNION>

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Germanic 
criticism of 
Dante. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. Arthur John Butler, favorably 
known for his edition (with English 
prose translation) of " The Divine 
Comedy," now presents to English readers " A Com- 
panion to Dante " (Macmillan), translated from the 
German of Herr G. A. Scartazzini. We say Herr 
Scartazzini, not merely because the author lives in 
a German commonwealth and writes in German as 
freely as in Italian, but also because his scholarship 
is distinctly of the German type, often pedantic and 
over-destructive in its criticism. It is surely a Ger- 
man who thus comments upon a certain theory of 
Father Gietmann : " Being a German, however, he 
was too honorable to contest unconditionally the 
personal reality of Beatrice." Surely, also, it is a 
German who thus argues for Dante's lengthy stay 
in Lucca (an argument based upon Purg. xxiv. 43 
sqq. ) : " Further, if the city pleased him for a lady's 
sake, he must have stayed for some time there ; for 
one does not in a couple of days fall in love with a 
lady, and, for her sake, with the place in which she 
lives." This " Companion to Dante " must not be 
confused with the " Manuale Dantesco" of the same 
author. That work, published in Milan, was put 
into the hands of English readers some years ago 
by Mr. Thomas Davidson, with the title " A Hand- 
book to Dante." Mr. Butler's translation is of the 
" Dante-Handbuch " (Leipzig) of 1892, which is 
Herr Scartazzini's revision of his own earlier " Pro- 
legomeni della Divina Commedia." All serious stu- 
dents of Dante must, of course, reckon with Herr 
Scartazzini, whom the death of Witte left at the 
head of Continental Dante scholarship. But few 
will be willing to accept all the results of his " neg- 
ative dogmatism," however they may derive instruc- 
tion from his labors. With Dante as with Homer, 
German criticism has discredited itself by its own 
excesses, and the best English scholarship is the 
safer guide in both cases. Mr. Butler, who well 
represents this scholarship, gives us a number of 
notes corrective of the wilder vagaries of his author, 
besides sounding a prefatory note of warning. One 
monumental instance of Herr Scartazzini's method 
of pleading may be given. Quoting (V. N. 41) 
the words, " Where this most noble lady was born, 
lived, and died," the author tells us that " to every 
unprejudiced mind " this sentence implies that Bea- 
trice "had never left her parents' house." But, un- 
fortunately for the theory, the antecedent to this 
phrase is " the city," and nothing more is meant 
than that Beatrice lived and died in Florence. So, 
in spite of Herr Scartazzini, many of us will cling 
to our old notions about Dante, although reasoning 
akin to that just quoted may have persuaded our 
critic to reject them. We may even, perhaps, con- 
tinue to believe in the "Letter to a Florentine 
Friend," although it is styled " a rhetorical exercise 
of later date, which was innocently accepted as a 
letter of Dante's." But Herr Scartazzini's book is 
really useful as " a companion to Dante," and those

who read no German should be grateful for it. Its 
chapters are arranged in five groups, " Dante in His 
Home," " Dante in Exile," " Dante's Spiritual Life," 
" Dante's Smaller Works," and " The Divina Com- 
media." Mr. Butler has taken the liberty of omit- 
ting the bibliographies, which was perhaps wise, 
and of condensing the final chapters, which was 
perhaps not so wise. 

^ r> Thomas A. Janvier's " An Em- 
bassy to Provence " (The Century 

/-i \ it. i ii i_ i 

Co.) is the pleasantly whimsical rec- 
ord of a sentimental journey, mainly by carriage, 
from Marseilles to Avignon. The trip may be 
made by the rapide in two hours ; but the " Em- 
bassy," true to diplomatic usage and tradition, man- 
aged to consume three months and four days on 
the journey. The object of the " mission " a 
visit to the Avignon nest of Provencal poets, the 
founders of the Felibridge brotherhood was hap- 
pily accomplished. Roumanille, Mistral, Mathieu, 
Gras, leaders of the tuneful choir, were found in 
their charming homes ; there was much good-fellow- 
ship and cordiality, with the due admixture of " Pro- 
vencal song and sunburnt mirth " echoes of which 
linger pleasantly in Mr. Janvier's pages. Rouma- 
nille's story of the beginning of his life-work is 
touching : " He was but a lad of seventeen, a teacher 
in the school at Tarascon, when writing in French 
he first began to dabble in verse. One Sunday, 
when he was at home in Saint-Remy, his mother 
said to him, 'Why, Jduse, they tell me thou art 
making paper talk ! ' ' Making paper talk, mother ? ' 
'Yes, that is what they tell me. What is it thou 
art putting on the paper? What dost thou make 
it say ? ' ' But it is nothing, mother.' ' Oh, yes, 
my handsome Jduse, it is something. Tell thy 
mother what it is.' But when he recited to her his 
French verses she shook her head sorrowfully, and 
sorrowfully said to him, 'I do not understand!' 
' And then,' said Roumanille, ' my heart rose up 
within me and cried, " Write thy verses in the beau- 
tiful language that thy dear mother knows ! " That 
very week I wrote my first poem in Provencal, 
" Jeje"; and, being at home again the next Sunday, 
I recited it to her. When she wept, and kissed me, 
I knew that my verses had found their way to her 
heart ; and thenceforth I wrote only in Provencal.' " 
Such was the germ of the poetical brotherhood of 
the Felibridge now a great society with branches 
in various parts of France and Spain. The volume 
contains a portrait of Mistral, and Mr. R. W. Gil- 
der has contributed a fine sonnet to "The New 
Troubadours." 

Sir W. Eraser's "Hie et Ubique" 
(imported by Scribner) is so various 
in matter and in manner as fairly to 
beggar description. The book is a unique medley 
of stories of eminent people, striking personal ex- 
periences, curiosities of literature, ingenious deriva- 
tions (too ingenious, mostly), obiter dicta, and what 
not, the club-corner chat of a genial man of the

world, who has seen much, read widely, and re- 
flected moderately. The author has a good deal to 
say, incidentally, about Shakespeare ( he even peers 
cautiously into the Baconian mare's-nest), and 
among other questions he starts the following amus- 
ing one : " Have the lovers of Shakespeare ever 
asked or answered this question ? The stage direc- 
tion towards the end of that most beautiful scene 
between Hamlet and his father's spirit is, ' Cock 
crows.' Can it be possible that at any period since 
the immortal William's work was first produced an 
imitation of a cock crowing was given? can there 
have been a time when it would not have produced 
a roar of laughter ? The very notion of a ' cock-a- 
doodle-doo' coming immediately upon the pathetic 
utterances of the phantom is quite beyond my be- 
lief." This dubious " stage direction " gives rise to 
other reflections. Why, for instance, has it not 
served as a practical hint to enterprising managers ? 
Here is a chance for a bit of stage realism that 
would throw Mr. Vincent Crummles's "pump and 
tub scene " hopelessly into the shade. The public, 
we are given to understand, wants " veritism " and 
does not care sixpence for the literary and artistic 
standards of an effete phase of culture. We have 
had real horses, real fire engines, real waterfalls in 
our plays, and real bores in our novels. Then why 
not the tragedy of " Hamlet " with a real crow from 
a real cock? The public would be gratified, man- 
agerial coffers would be filled, and the behests of 
the immortal bard would be carried out. " Hie et 
Ubique" is an altogether capital book to while away 
a winter evening. 

Tales from Uniform in size and form with his 

Shakespeare, two series of last year " Tales from 

Ten Poets" and "Tales from the 
Dramatists," Mr. Harrison S. Morris now issues 
the famous " Tales from Shakespeare " by Charles 
and Mary Lamb, with additions by himself to make 
them inclusive of the whole number of Shakespeare's 
plays (Lippincott). Owing either to the personal 
taste of the Lambs, or to the wishes of the original 
publisher, or to some other practical consideration, 
only twenty of the Shakespearean plays were taken 
up by the "Tales" as already known to us, and 
these constitute Volumes I. and II. of the present 
edition. The remaining sixteen plays, which include 
the whole series of English histories and all the Ro- 
man plays, occupy Volumes III. and IV., and until 
the present time have not been rendered into prose. 
They are some of the most difficult of adaptation 
to this plan of treatment, yet Mr. Morris has been 
very successful, even though his work is brought 
into such close juxtaposition with that of the inim- 
itable " Elia " and his gifted sister. Each volume con- 
tains four illustrations ; these are particularly well- 
chosen, and are thus in marked contrast to some 
that disfigure the numerous cheap and ugly editions 
of this classic work which have been thrown on the 
market during the eighty-six years since 1807, when 
the book was first published. 



A picturesque Ma 3 or Joseph Kirkland is the accred- 
narrative of the ited historian of Chicago, having 

Chicago massacre, p i 1. j. j.*i.i i. i.' e 

iairly won that title by his fascinat- 
ing " Story of Chicago." The special episode in 
the city annals known as " The Chicago Massacre 
of 1812," already conspicuously treated in the larger 
work, has recently been made the subject of a spe- 
cial volume (Dibble), wherein it is narrated at 
greater length, and in the light of newly unearthed 
facts. The strictly new matter contained in this 
volume is based upon the recollections of Mr. Da- 
rius Heald, still living, the son of the Captain Heald 
who commanded the white soldiers on the day of 
the massacre. Mr. Heald has heard the story from 
his parents many times, and thus his evidence, al- 
though at second hand, is of great historical value. 
Mr. Kirkland has gleaned, more carefully than any 
of his predecessors, the facts relating to the massa- 
cre, and the record as it stands in his book is prob- 
ably as complete as we can ever hope it to be. The 
style of the narrative is picturesque and vivid, as 
was to be expected of a successful novelist turned 
historian, and the numerous illustrations add mate- 
rially to the attractiveness of the work. 



Fifty years of 
good fishing. 



Lovers of the contemplative man's 
recreation will find both technical 
lore and matter of entertainment in 
Major F. Powell Hopkins's " Fishing Experiences 
of Half a Century" (Longmans). The Major's 
piscatorial exploits have been confined chiefly to 
England and Ireland, though he has practised the 
"gentle art" in Ceylon and southern Spain, where 
he was quartered for a time with his regiment. 
The book is full of good humor and good stories, 
and the special chapter on "The Fast Reel" will 
be approved by amateurs. There are a number of 
illustrations, of varying merit, by the author. 

In their new volume, "To Gipsy- 
Pen and Pencil land / The Centu Co> \ Mr and 
vn Gipsyland. ^ J /' . 

Mrs. Pennell present their usual 
combination of good drawing and flimsy writing. 
The text is essentially a rhapsodic tale of the writer's 
various encounters with and impressions of the 
Romany folk, beginning with the members of a 
Gipsy band at an up-town Philadelphia beer-garden, 
and ending with the less sophisticated types of 
Hungary and Transylvania. Mr. Pennell's strong 
drawings some of which have suffered in the 
printing form the substance of the book and its 
sufficient raison d'etre. 



A book of 
"Drolls." 



Mr. J. H. Pearce's " Drolls from 
Shadowland " (Macmillan) are not 
unlike his "Pastels in Prose," at 
least in brevity. Mr. Pearce's name is compara- 
tively new, though he may be remembered by many 
as the author of "Inconsequent Lives." Some of 
his crystals of thought on occult problems come 
dangerously near the uncanny. " The man who 
coined his blood into gold," " The man who could

talk with the birds," " The man who desired to be a 
tree," and the man who parted with his soul for a 
kiss and died a gray-haired bishop, with these 
and the other " Drolls " to haunt us, our dreams 
need not be devoid of spectral interest. Crisp and 
" Frenchy," Poesque and poetical, artful and artis- 
tic, are these strays from shadowland, and we may 
safely commend them as an antidote against som- 
nolency. For so weird a book, a cover design by 
Mr. Aubrey Beardsley had been in keeping ; but it 
is pretty as it is, with its light-blue ribbed cloth, 
etched frontispiece, and rubricated title. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



THE new " Riverside " edition of Thoreau, to be com- 
pleted in ten volumes, gives to our philosophical natur- 
alist his deserved place among the classical writers of 
the country. " A Week on the Concord and Merrimack 
Rivers " is the opening volume of this edition, and has 
a fine portrait of the author. The other volumes now 
issued are " Walden," " Cape Cod," and " The Maine 
Woods." Each volume has a prefatory bibliographical 
note and a separate index. The green cloth covers of 
this edition, as well as the other mechanical features, 
are in the good taste that the publishers (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.) have led us to expect. 

THE uniform and neatly gotten-np edition of Mr. 
Cable's novels which the Messrs. Scribner have just is- 
sued will be welcome to the purchasers of sets. There 
are five volumes " Old Creole Days," " The Grand- 
issimes," " Dr. Sevier," " Bonaventure," and " Strange 
True Stories of Louisiana." However Mr. Cable may 
be without honor among the Creoles whom he has with 
such subtle art depicted for us, he has, and is not likely 
soon to lose, a large following among the readers of good 
literature, wherever they may be found. 

MESSRS. Scribner have just published a new edition, 
in four volumes, with many portraits, of " The Auto- 
biography and Recollections of Laura, Duchess of 
Abrantes." The work has been scarce for some years, 
and the text has been carefully revised for the new edi- 
tion. The world does not seem willing to forget the 
Napoleonic story, and this history of the inner life of 
Napoleon's court will always rank among the most en- 
tertaining works upon the Napoleonic era. 

" OUR Great West " is a volume made up of maga- 
zine articles by Mr. Julian Ralph (Harper). It is de- 
scribed as " a study of the present conditions and future 
possibilities of the new commonwealths and capitals of 
the United States." It is of the civilized West that 
Mr. Ralph has written, and his book makes little men- 
tion of Indians, or of cowboys, or of wild game. In- 
stead, he gives us the politics, the society, and the com- 
mercial development of such cities as Chicago and San 
Francisco, such states as Colorado and the Dakotas. 
Mr. Ralph's descriptions are superficial, but picturesque 
and sensible. Anecdotes and statistics, standing side 
by side, give variety to his animated chapters. 

Too late for use as a guide, but not too late to have 
a certain value for purposes of reference, we have a 
little pamphlet upon " The Publishers' and Other Book 
Exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition," made 
up of articles that have been appearing from time to 
time in "The Publishers' Weekly." Whoever is re- 



sponsible for these articles has made a careful search 
for the book exhibits in the Exposition, and has un- 
earthed some of them from out-of-the-way corners. 
He seems to have missed one or two small exhibits of 
Scandinavian books, but with this exception the record 
is complete, and gives us intelligent criticism, from the 
manufacturing and trade standpoints, of the collections 
displayed. 

" THE Tenant of Wildfell Hall," in two volumes, com- 
pletes the tasteful Dent edition of the Bronte sisters, 
and the twelve volumes may now be placed in a row. 
To the edition of Fielding which Mr. Saintsbury is editing 
for the same publishers (Macmillan & Co.), there has 
just been added " Amelia " in three volumes. Mr. Saints- 
bury's introduction discusses the characters of the novel, 
and gives a brief sketch of critical opinion concerning its 
relative merits. " It cannot be denied," he says, " that 
the book, now as always, has incurred a considerable 
amount of hinted fault and hesitated dislike." The 
editor is himself inclined to think that " Amelia " is as 
good as " Joseph Andrews " or " Tom Jones," although 
even he seems a trifle hesitant in the opinion. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, Nov. 9, 1893. 

I learn that Prof. Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen spent last 
summer at " The Moorlands," his beautiful new home at 
Southampton, Long Island, engaged in putting the fin- 
ishing touches to " A Commentary on the Writings of 
Henrik Ibsen," on which he has been at work during 
spare moments for several years, and which I am at 
liberty to announce. Prof. Boyesen's long personal ac- 
quaintance with Ibsen, as well as his remarkable lin- 
guistic abilities, particularly adapt him to be the Nor- 
wegian's interpreter. Most of the English reviews of 
Ibsen's work and philosophy have been clearly wide of 
the mark, while but little criticism worthy of the name 
has as yet appeared in this country. Prof. Boyesen's 
book will be published here and in England, by the 
Macmillans, some time in January or February. The 
opening chapters will deal with Ibsen's early or histor- 
ical plays as a whole, the later or philosophical plays 
receiving a chapter each. Ibsen's poems will also re- 
ceive separate attention. The translations of the poems 
which Prof. Boyesen has made preserve the metre and 
the rhyme of the originals, as in the case of Taylor's 
" Faust." He has also translated directly many pas- 
sages from the dramas illustrative of the philosophical 
propositions considered existing translations not be- 
ing very available in this respect. Altogether, stu- 
dents of Ibsen's writings are likely to find this " Com- 
mentary " a valuable assistance in their investigations, 
while it will be of interest to the general reader as an 
interpreter of the text. The articles on Ibsen which 
Prof. Boyesen has contributed to THE DIAL will reap- 
pear in this volume. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker, the young Canadian novelist who 
has come into notice so rapidly during the past year, 
has returned to America from London, in order to ar- 
range for the serial publication of his new novel, " The 
Trespasser," and to obtain a little rest after a year of 
very hard work. He is planning trips to Canada and 
to Mexico, and will probably spend a month or two in 
New York before leaving for England. In spite of the 
professed object of his visit he is already working out 
the scheme of his next romance, which will deal with 



1893.]

ante-Revolutionary times, and will introduce George 
Washington as a British officer in the French and In- 
dian wars. 

The editors of " Harper's," " Scribner's," and the " Cen- 
tury " magazines have made extraordinary efforts in the 
direction of brilliant Christmas numbers this year. A 
glance at the advanced sheets of all three publications 
shows almost unparalleled excellence in the engravings 
and reproductions, to say nothing of the lists of distin- 
guished contributors. Particularly notable are Mr. T. 
Cole's engravings after Rembrandt, the first in the series 
of old Dutch masters to appear in the " Century." The 
expression of color values by plain black and white is 
quite marvellous. In " Scribner's," Mr. Allan Mar- 
quand's account of his search for della Robbias in Italy 
is illustrated by half-tone reproductions in tint, which 
render the values of the old paintings in almost as re- 
markable a way. It is very clear, however, that, al- 
though process-work is rapidly approaching perfection, 
we shall not be able to dispense with the wood-engraver 
yet awhile. 

Another notable instance of artistic process-work is 
shown in the illustrations of Mr. Charles A. Platt's 
forthcoming book, " Italian Gardens." It has only been 
necessary for the artist-author to select the point of 
view in each case, the camera, the process man and the 
printer supplementing his work with their own. The 
book itself is a thorough exposition of that formal style 
of landscape architecture which came into existence 
during the Renaissance, and it will be found very help- 
ful by our constantly increasing class of villa-dwellers 
in summer resorts and the suburbs of great cities. 

Mention of Mr. Platt's book reminds one of the great 
number of artists who have recently commenced work 
as authors also. It is no longer possible to count them 
on the fingers of both hands. The series of " American 
Artists' Adventures " and of " Artists' Impressions at 
the Fair," now running in two of the magazines, are de- 
veloping literary talent in several unsuspected quarters. 
The artists, too, have a great advantage over their lit- 
erary brethren, for they illustrate their own articles, 
and hence the illustrations are always satisfactory. The 
second of the two series just mentioned will shortly be 
published in book form by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons as " Some Artists at the Fair." I am informed by 
the firm that each of the artist-authors approaches the 
subject from a different point of view, and gives his im- 
pressions, both of the human spectacle and of the aes- 
thetic aspects of the Fair, with characteristic candor and 
individuality. 

. World's Fair books multiply apace. Some of them 
have been written and printed with surprising rapidity. 
Mr. Ellsworth and Mr. Tudor Jenks, of the Century 
Company, were delegated to prepare this firm's 
"World's Fair Book" for children as late as the last 
week in September. Mr. Jenks had completed his 
manuscript by October 10, and the last form, illustra- 
tions and all, was on the press two weeks later. 

The death of Francis Parkman is announced as I 
write, and I am reminded of several pleasant interviews 
with the historian at New Castle, Portsmouth Harbor, 
New Hampshire, where his daughter and artist son-in- 
law, Mr. and Mrs. J. Templeman Coolidge, have their 
summer home in the old Wentworth mansion. Mr. 
Parkman passed a number of summers at New Castle, 
and seemed to take much pleasure in the quiet life of 
the place. Until his health gave way entirely he could 
often be seen rowing about the creeks and inlets, or 



sailing in Mr. Coolidge's wherry, with its red-colored 
lateen sail. Another of the New Castle literary colony, 
Mr. John Albee, has just come to New York for a 
month's visit. Mr. Albee was the pioneer of the col- 
ony, so to speak, having purchased the Governor Jaffrey 
cottage and farm nearly twenty-five years ago. I no- 
ticed last summer that he had newly decorated the old 
dining-room, and, looking closely, observed that the 
border of the wall-paper was composed of a row of 
stereotyped plates extending clear around the room. 
On inquiring the reason of this strange decoration, Mr. 
Albee informed me that these were the plates of his 
first book, and that this was his method of getting peo- 
ple to read it. All this is changed now, however, for 
I learned some time ago from Messrs. Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co. that Mr. Albee's " Prose Idyls," published 
by them last year, has gone into a third or fourth edi- 
tion. 

Among books not yet announced is a new volume of 
travels by Dr. Henry M. Field, entitled " The Barbary 
Coast," to be published this season by the Scribners. 
Dr. Field's warm-hearted individuality always finds its 
way into his volumes, and has created for him an in- 
creasing class of readers who look for his successive 
books with deep interest. 

The library of two hundred best or most popular books 
which Messrs. J. Selwiu Tait & Sons have been so 
long preparing will soon begin to appear. It will be 
remembered that one hundred and fifty of them are 
works of fiction, chosen by a comparison of lists of most 
popular novels supplied by libraries throughout the 
country. The other fifty volumes have been selected 
from general literature. Messrs. Tait & Sons have kept 
fifty of the young artists of the Art Students' League 
employed in preparing illustrations for these books for 
over six months. An article concerning this series and 
the librarians' reports will be published in the next num- 
ber of the " Forum." 

Mr. Willis O. Chapin, author of " Masters and Mas- 
terpieces of Engraving," one of Messrs. Harper & 
Brothers' most important books of the season, resides at 
Buffalo, N. Y., and is a lawyer by profession. He has 
made a deep study of the history and theory of the 
engraver's art, and is an acknowledged authority on the 
subject. Mr. William J. Linton and Mr. Frederick 
Keppel have aided him with their advice and assistance.

LITERARY XOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



The New York Shakespeare Society will begin, on 
January 1, 1894, the publication of " The Bankside 
Quarterly," a quarterly magazine devoted to Shake- 
speariana and the Contemporary Drama. The editorial 
conduct will be assumed by members of the society, and 
the magazine will be published by the Shakespeare 
Press, a new printing concern, incorporated under the 
laws of the state of New Jersey, but doing business in 
the city of New York, for the purpose of printing edi- 
tions of Shakespeare and books of Shakespearian and 
dramatic literature. 

The " Anthropological Series," to be edited by Pro-

ton. The books in this series will treat of ethnology, 
prehistoric archseology, ethnography, etc., and the pur- 
pose is to make anthropology better known to intelli-

gent readers who are not specialists and have no desire 
to be, although the series will be one which no special 
student can afford to ignore. While these books will 
be of general interest, they will be written by authori- 
ties, and scientific accuracy will not be sacrificed to pop- 
ularity. The first book in this series will be " Woman's 
Place in Primitive Culture," by Professor O. R. Mason 
of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The meeting of the Association Litte'raire et Artis- 
tique Internationale, held at Barcelona during the clos- 
ing days of September, was reported for the New York 
" Nation " by the only American present. The writer 
signs only his initials, but we assume them to stand for 
the name of Mr. Theodore Stanton. His account of the 
conference, which was mainly devoted to copyright, is 
very interesting, particularly from the fact that the del- 
egates seemed to favor the eventual establishment of 
perpetual rights in intellectual property. As a tempo- 
rary measure, the uniform term of one hundred years 
from publication was recommended. Spain already 
does about as much as this possibly more, her term 
being eighty years beyond the life of the author. 

A FRAGMENT FROM AUSTIN DOBSON. 
The New York " Times " recently printed an anni- 
versary note on Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman and 
his library, written, we understand, by Mr. Henri Pe'ne' 
Du Bois, who tells a pretty story about Mr. Austin Dob- 
son's " Vignettes in Rhyme," a book that was edited by 
Mr. Stedman for the American publishers, and reviewed 
in THE DIAL in its earliest number (May, 1880). " In 
his dedication of the book to Oliver Wendell Holmes," 
says Mr. Du Bois, " Austin Dobson had written the 
phrase, ' made me very pleased and proud.' Stedman, 
objecting to the use of ' very ' before a participle, 
changed the phrase to ' made me proud and very happy.' 
[Mr. Du Bois is in error here, as the exact wording in 
the dedication is 'made me very proud and happy.'] 
He advised Dobson, and received from him the follow- 
ing neat reply: 

" Dear S : The error is allowed : 

'T is clear I can 't be ' pleased ' and ' proud '; 

So, if it give your scruples ease, 

Let me be ' proud ' and what you please. 

Indeed, I 'm rather glad I said it ; 

It shows how carefully you edit, 

And if I break the head of Priscian, 

I hope you '11 always be physician, 

Since you so cleverly can cut 

A plaster for his occiput 

Making it plain how close you follow, 

In all his attributes, Apollo, 

Who, with a musical degree, 

Like Holmes, was also an M.D. ! " 



THE WAGNER CULT IN PARIS. 

The Parisians having been at last induced to take 
their Wagner, the manner of their taking him becomes 
of interest, especially as it reproduces certain phases of 
the Wagner-Kampf in Germany a generation ago. The 
following notes are from the New York " Evening Post ": 

" If Wagner could have lived as long as Verdi, he 
would have been surprised to find that in 1893 the chief 
seat of the Wagner cult would be, not at Bayreuth or 
Munich, but at Paris. There the ' Walkiire ' has in a 
few months reached its fortieth performance, and the 
repertoire of the Grand Opera reads week after week, 
'Valkyrie,' relache, 'Lohengrin,' 'Lohengrin,' relache, 
' Valkyrie.' Parodies of these operas are now in order. 
Many years ago Suppd wrote the music to a ' Lohen- 



gelb,' but the Parisians are to have a parody of their 
own this winter, entitled ' The Little Lohengrin.' A 
parody of the ' Valkyrie ' has already appeared in a 
Boulevard theatre. Its name is an atrocious pun on 
'La Valkyrie' ' La V'lakyrit ' (la voila qui rit). As 
a specimen of the fun, the sword scene may be men- 
tioned. Siegmund soliloquizes and wonders where Wo- 
tan has put the sword: Ou diable Va-t-il cache? At 
that moment he sees the glowing hilt in the tree, and 
exclaims, ' Tiens, Us ont V electricite ! ' Sieglinde taunts 
him : ' Have you any muscle ? ' Whereupon he spits 
in his hands and pulls out the sword." 

THE VERSATILE AND INSATIATE MR. LANG. 

An English writer thus rhymingly bewails Mr. An- 
drew Lang's annexation of a large proportion of the 
attractive literary territories: 

" Lang-syne I loved a ' Fairy Book ' 

That since I 've seldom seen, 
Unprefaced, of a homely look, 

And clad in sober green. 
Now every ' myth ' that e'er was bred 

In Europe or Penang 
Is ' edited ' in blue or red 

(Of course) by A w L g I 

' Sir Walter's ' novels never pall 

For strange editions new 
The public tireless seems to call : 

I turn the cover Phew ! 
What, can 't we buy our Northern Mage 

(Let scholiasts go hang !) 
Without, upon his title-page. 

The name of A w L g ? 

Adown the envenomed ' I> ly N ws ' 

Each morn I joy to note 
How lettered culture doth infuse 

A soothing antidote. 
And stumbling on some well-worn tag 

Of academic slang 
Ah ! do n't I know the learned wag, 

My blithesome A w L g ! 

I 've often wished this critic sound 

Would make a slight faux pas, 
Some frantic theory propound, 

And fall a prey Aha ! 
To Censure's fang: (This rhyming phrase 

I kindly throw away) 
Confound the man ! he always says 

Just what I want to say. 
I '11 straight take ' ship ' for foreign shore 

(But for that hateful ' sign ! '). 
And ne'er of sage or classic more 

I '11 read another line. 
No matter what he says or sings 

I close it with a bang, 
For over every mortal thing 's 

The spoor of A w L g ! " 



NEWLY-PRINTED LETTERS OF MRS. BROWNING. 

"The Bookman" (London), in its issue for October, 
1893, contains selections from the catalogues of auto- 
graph sales during 1892-3; and among other interest- 
ing items are extracts from two letters written by Eliz- 
abeth Barrett Browning to R. H. Home. The first of 
these is dated January 30, 1844, and is as follows: . 

" I think from a far remembrance that Mrs. Norton's 
first poem was called ' The Undying One.' Her chief 
poem, that is, the principal one in her last volume, is 
' The Dream.' Have you read these ? to be of opinion 
still, as said the ' Quarterly,' that she is a modification 
of Byron ? The only poems which could have suggested 
such a likeness are the personal ones, I fancy, and they, 



1893.]

with some intensity and much pathos, are very unlike 
Byron. Do you, too, call Byron vindictive ? I do not. 
If he turned upon the dark, it was by the instinct of 
passion, not by the theory of Vengeance, I believe and 
am assured. Poor, poor Lord Byron ! How would I 
lay the Sun and Moon against a tennis-ball that he had 
more tenderness in one section of his heart than Mrs. 
Norton has in all her's though a tenderness misunder- 
stood and crushed, ignorantly, profanely, and solely by 
false friends and a pattern wife. His blood is on our 
heads, on us in England even as Napoleon's is. Two 
stains of the sort have we in one century and what 
will wash them out ? " 

The second letter is dated Feb. 20, 1844, and with 
reference to the influence on the mind of Charles Dick- 
ens of the French School of imaginative literature, says : 
" Since I went through the romances of the gifted 
Frenchman (Victor Hugo) my admiration for our coun- 
tryman has paled down, paler and paler." And again: 
" George Sand is the greatest female genius the world 
ever saw at least since it saw Sappho, who broke off 
a fragment of her soul to be guessed by as creation 
did by its fossils." 

NEW USES OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. 

Mr. Edwin H. Woodruff, Librarian of the Leland 
Stanford, Junior, University, has printed his address, 
given before the Librarians' Congress of last July, upon 
" Some Present Tendencies in University Libraries." 
The following paragraphs are among the most signifi- 
cant: 

" The administration of the university library has 
been compelled, and will be compelled still further, to 
adapt itself to the new methods of university work. In 
beginning the study of some special topic, professor and 
student wish to make their own preliminary bibliog- 
raphy, and then, and afterwards, carry on their investi- 
gation by moving from foot-note to foot-note, from ref- 
erence to reference, from allusion to allusion, and from 
one bibliographical aid to another. It is, therefore, im- 
portant that the freest possible access to the books them- 
selves should be had - that is, ideally, the freedom of 
access of a scholar to his private library, access that 
is regulated by such care as (to express it in the lan- 
guage of the law) an ordinarily prudent student would 
exercise in his own library of equal value. It is not un- 
likely that the university librarian will be forced to take 
an entirely new point of view, namely, that the collec- 
tion is to be considered as the private working library 
of the university student, even of the freshman. 

" Perhaps most of the administrative changes pro- 
posed to meet these new conditions will find the library 
authorities objecting with an 'impossible'; but if the 
new method is the correct one, then the modifications 
must be made in one way or another, for the whole 
internal polity of a university cannot be made to con- 
form to the old library regulations. In these days of 
the extension of the elective franchise it will not do to 
say that a man is to be deprived of his vote because he 
is not fit to vote. The way to make him fit is not by 
perpetuating the restriction, but by giving him the right 
to vote. It is not too much to hope that, even in the 
largest university libraries, all students before very long 
may be accorded the freest access to all books in the 
department in which they are working. 

" Access to the shelves requires that the shelf nota- 
tion, whatever else it may be, should be the simplest 
possible. As men do not ordinarily think in decimals, 
an effort should be made to avoid decimals ; as the tem- 



per of the investigator should be calm, it must not be 
ruffled by too strange a mingling of symbolical letters 
and figures. As to classification: One cannot fail to 
admire the genius of the creators of all the elaborate 
schemes for the amelioration of shelf arrangements. 
But one must sometimes feel perplexed to choose among 
them, and will echo the exclamation of the Scotch peas- 
ant to his companion when, with awe, they looked for the 
first time over the prospect from the top of Ben Lomond: 
' Ah, Mon Jock, but arna the warks o' the Lard deevil- 
ish ! ' However, each kind of library must adopt that 
classification which suits it best. Our modern univer- 
sity library is a workshop, and, as in any other work- 
shop, the tools must be arranged subordinate to the con- 
venience of the worker. The professor and student 
move along, not so much from one class of books to an- 
other as from one author reference to another."

[Nov. 16, 



THE ATLANTIC FOR 1894 

Will contain, among other attractions, 

Philip and his Wife, a Serial Story, by 
Margaret Deland. 

This is undoubtedly the most important work of the author 
of " John Ward, Preacher," involving some of the leading 
problems in modern social life, studied very thoroughly, and 
treated with admirable skill and grace. 

Short Stories. 

By Miss Jewett, Mrs. Catherwood, Joel Chandler Harris, 
Mrs. Wiggin, and others. 

History and Biography 

Will be very effectively represented by papers from Capt. 
Mahan, Professor McMaster, the historian, Hon. J. C. Ban- 
croft Davis, Professor Mendenhall, and others. 

Literary History and Criticism. 

Will be made attractive by letters of Coleridge and Thoreau, 
and by papers on engaging themes from Sir Edward 
Strachey, Professor Kittredge, of Harvard, Professor Ty- 
rell, of Dublin, and other very competent writers. 

Nature. 

Delightful sketches on the seasons and the aspects of Nature 
in Florida, Utah, and Canada, are promised by Miss Thomas, 
Bradford Torrey, Frank Bolles, and Olive Thome Miller. 

Educational Topics 

Will be treated with the care and thought due to their im- 
portance. This is regarded as one of the most useful parts 
of the work of the Atlantic. Articles are assured from 
Professor Shaler, Horace E. Scudder, and others who are 
able to speak with authority. 

Music and the Drama. 

Special attention will be given to dramatic criticism and to 
the development of the theatre in America, with reminis- 
cences of famous actors and actresses.

D. APPLETON & COMPANY'S NEW BOOKS. 



In the Track of the Sun. 

Readings from the Diary of a Globe Trotter. By FRED- 
ERICK DIODATI THOMPSON. Profusely illustrated 
with Engravings from Photographs and from Draw- 
ings by HARRY FENN. Large 8vo, cloth, gilt top, 
$6.00. 

In this magnificently illustrated volume the author describes in "an 
easy, entertaining, intelligent manner the tour of the world. Starting 
from New York, he crosses the continent, sails from Vancouver for Ja- 
pan, where he spends some time in studying noteworthy features of that 
delightful country, and then visits China, Singapore, Ceylon, and other 
places, reserving a considerable portion of his time for India and Egypt, 
where he does most extensive sight-seeing, and afterward traversing 
Italy and France, and returning to New York by way of London and 
Liverpool. Mr. Thompson is an instructive and amusing cicerone. The 
illustrations, comprising full-page pictures, vignettes and other text 
cuts, head- and tail-pieces, and initials, number over two hundred, and 
present an itinerary of the journey around the world, including not 
only scenery, historic and remarkable buildings and street scenes, but 
also an abundance of studies from life, which show contrasting types of 
humanity the world over, ranging from our Western Indians to Mahar- 
ajahs of the Orient, and from the beautiful women of Japan to Egyptian 
fellahs. "In the Track of the Sun" gives a bird's-eye view of the 
world's picturesque features. 

Teems of &(ature. 

By WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. Profusely illustrated 
by PAUL DE LONGPRE. 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $4.00. 

These verses offer a full expression of the great poet's love of Nature. 
The volume contains over forty poems, the list beginning with the clas- 
sic "To a Waterfowl," and closing with "Our Fellow- Worshippers." 
The chronological arrangement enables the student of Bryant to follow 
the influences of ripening age and enlarged experience upon the poet's 
attitude toward Nature. M. Longpre, an exact as well as a loving stu- 
dent of the fields and forests, has gathered a rich harvest of the Amer- 
ican flora, and his thoroughly artistic and beautiful studies, comprising 
nearly one hundred subjects, have the value of truthful records as well 
as high aesthetic worth. 

The Country School in New England. 

By CLIFTON JOHNSON. With 60 illustrations from 
Photographs and Drawings made by the author. 
Square 8vo, cloth, gilt edges, $2.50. 
This volume is so delightfully novel, quaint, picturesque, and so 
thoroughly infused with the fresh and unsophisticated spirit of child- 
hood, that it inspires instant sympathy and appreciation. The author 
describes successive periods of the country school the winter and 
summer terms, the scholars in their classes and at the blackboard, their 
punishments, their fishing and coasting, their duties and amusements 
on the farm in short, the everyday life of the girls and boys of rural 
New England in the days of our fathers and our own. Every phase of 
his subject is aptly illustrated with pictures from life. 

Louisa {Miiblbacb's Historical &{ovels. 

New edition, 18 vols. Illustrated, 12mo, cloth, per 
volume, $1.00. 

In offering to the public our new and illustrated 12mo edition of 
Louisa Miihlbach's celebrated historical romances, we wish to call at- 
tention to the continued and increasing popularity of these books for 
over thirty years. These romances are as well known in England and 
America as in the author's native country, Germany, and it has been 
the unanimous verdict that no other romances reproduce so vividly the 
spirit and social life of the times which are described. In the vividness 
of style, abundance of dramatic incidents, and the distinctness of the 
characters portrayed, these books offer exceptional entertainment, 
while at the same time they familiarize the reader with the events and 
personages of great historical epochs.

Ticciola. 

With 130 illustrations by J. F. 
8vo, cloth, gilt, $1.50. 



"Picciola: The Prisoner of Fenestrella, or Captivity Captive," is 
one of the most charming and popular of French classics. The artist 
has thoroughly sympathized with the delicacy and beauty of this tender 
and touching story, and the publishers believe that this edition will 
take a permanent place as the standard illustrated "Picciola." It is 
uniform with the illustrated editions of " Colette " and " An Attic Phil- 
osopher in Paris." 

Tbe Story of Washington. 

By ELIZABETH EGGLESTON SEELYE. Edited by Dr. 
EDWARD EGGLESTON. With over 100 illustrations 
by ALLEGRA EGGLESTON. A new volume in the 
" Delights of History " Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 
This book will supply a demand for a life of Washington, the man, 
of convenient size, popular, including the latest results of research, 
planned according to the methods of the new school of history, and 
containing illustrations of almost every available subject which the story 
includes. Mrs. Seelye's book is always interesting, and it is not incum- 
bered with superfluous details. It is uniform with " The Story of Colum- 
bus," by the same author. 

The Brontes in Ireland. 

By Dr. WILLIAM WRIGHT. With portraits and numer- 
ous Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This book presents a new and thrilling page in the family history of 
the Bronte sisters. It tells of a foundling and the evil which he wrought 
to his benefactors ; of an innocent child taken from his family, whom 
he never saw again, to a life of slavery ; of the Homeric battles of Irish 
peasantry ; and it pictures Charlotte Bronte's uncle as he prepared a new 
blackthorn and crossed to England to wreak Irish vengeance upon a 
malicious reviewer of " Jane Eyre." It is a book of absorbing interest. 

Tbe T{omance of an Empress. 

Catharine IL, of Russia. By K. WALISZEWSKI. 12mo, 
cloth. (Nearly ready.) 

There has been no more extraordinary figure in Russian history than 
this gifted, tempestuous, and dissolute empress, " the Semiramis of the 
North." M. Waliszewski's book is based upon unpublished documents 
in the state archives, and upon the memoirs and cprrespondence of his 
subject. His story of the plots and intrigues, the wars and triumphs, 
the succession of favorites, and the fierce outbreaks with which Cath- 
arine's reign was filled, makes a most extraordinary historical romance, 
and presents some fresh aspects of European history. 

c/7 Friend of the Queen. 

By PAUL GUILLOT.. With 2 portraits? 12rno, cloth, 
$1.00. 

This is the true and intimate life history of the Swedish soldier, 
Count Axel Fersen, whose romantic friendship with the ill-fated Marie 
Antoinette led him gladly to peril his life again and again in vain at- 
tempts at rescue. The hero of court fetes in the palmy days of Louis 
XVI., a soldier in our Revolution and an aid-de-camp at Yorktown, the 
disguised coachman of Marie Antoinette in the flight which ended so 
wretchedly at Varennes, the grand marshal of Sweden, and finally the 
victim of mob fury, killed like a mad dog with sticks and stones in 
Stockholm, make a career to which history offers few counterparts. 

The Jlrt of {Music. 

By C. HUBERT H. PARRY, M.A. 12mo, cloth, $4.00. 

A concise and admirable exposition of the growth and development 
of musical art, full of the kind of information which persons desiring 
to cultivate a taste in music ought to have.

" An American who won golden opinions from Longfellow and others

agitation, who saw active service during the civil war, who has long 
been identified with the literature of the United States, who has de- 
voted many years to European travel, and who has made himself famil- 
iar with gipsy life and lore wherever he has encountered them, could 
scarcely fail to have a career worth chronicling." Edinburgh Scots-

In two very different fields the application of heat and the appli-

by his rare combination of scientific insight and power of practical util- 
ization of his knowledge. He designed the ocean-cable ship Farraday; 
an electric railway and an electric furnace were among others of his in- 
ventions ; and in this day of electrical progress the autobiography of 
this great electrician will possess a pertinent and exceptional interest.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 1893. 



' ' In no way can Americans so effectively inform themselves on the subjefts that claim public 
attention from one month to another as by reading THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW." 



The Most Useful Magazine 

To the business man, the lawyer, the physician, the clergyman, the teacher, the 
politician, and to every one who is interested in affairs which con- 
cern the American public, and who wishes to keep 
fully abreast of the times, is 

THE 

NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

Every subject of importance is dealt with in its pages impartially, on both sides at the 
very time when the course of events brings it to the front, and by the very men or women 
whose opinions are most valued. THE REVIEW does not hesitate at the most liberal expenditure 
in order to secure articles from the highest authorities. Its list of contributors forms a roll of 
the representative men and women of the age. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW is the most widely read magazine of its class in the world, 
being neither scholastic nor technical, but popular and practical in its treatment of all topics. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW is the only periodical of its kind which has a recognized 
place as 

A Family Magazine. 

This is because it devotes much attention to subjects that are of particular interest to women. 
No other periodical in the world can point to such a succession of distinguished writers as 
have contributed to THE REVIEW during the past four years. The list embraces American and 
British Cabinet Ministers ; United States Senators and Representatives ; Governors of States ; 
American Ministers abroad ; Foreign Ministers to the United States ; Judges of the Supreme 
Court ; Ecclesiastical dignitaries and eminent theologians of every denomination ; officers of 
the Army and Navy ; famous physicians and scientists ; and in general men and women whose 
names are household words throughout the English-speaking world. 



Comments of the American and English Press. 



No other magazine in the world so fully and fairly presents 
the opinions of the leading writers and thinkers on all ques- 
tions of public interest as THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. 
Boston Journal. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW is ahead of any other 
magazine this country has seen in the importance of the topics 
it discusses and the eminence of its contributors. Albany 
Argus. 

THE REVIEW constantly offers to the public a programme 
of writers and essays that excite the reader and gratify the 
intellectual appetite. In this respect there is no other maga- 
zine that approaches it. New York Sun. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW needs but to be mentioned 
to be praised. It is one of the most powerful publications of 
the century, and without doubt one of the ablest. Kansas 
City Gazette. 



What are the editors of our monthlies thinking of to allow 
THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW to " draw " all the most in- 
teresting people upon the most interesting questions ? Daily 
Chronicle, London, England. 

The conductors of our reviews must be careful or they will 
find the ground cut from under their feet by their more go- 
ahead transatlantic rival, THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. 
Bath Herald, England. 

The old steady-going character of the English monthlies 
has changed ; but it is not yet equal to that of THE NORTH 
AMERICAN REVIEW, which is becoming increasingly popular 
in this country. Kidderminster Shuttle, England. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW was started before the 
memory of living man, and it is still regarded as an oracle. 
The Queen, London, England.

THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF THE 
UNITED STA TES. 

The corner stone of the building which is to 
be the permanent home of the Chicago Public 
Library has just been laid, with the ceremonies 
usual upon such occasions, and the Newberry 
Library has just transferred its collections to the 
magnificent structure that has been in process of 
erection for two years past. These occurrences, 
which mean so much for the intellectual future 
of Chicago, make a few remarks upon the 
libraries of the United States peculiarly appro- 
priate at the present time. As a basis for such 
remarks, there comes to us, at the same time, a 
"Circular of Information" from the National 
Bureau of Education, giving the most reef nt 
statistics upon the subject of our public libra- 
ries. The statistics are for the year 1891, 
which is as nearly up to date as could be ex- 
pected of a report prepared by the deliberate 
methods of our official collectors of such ma- 
terials. 

The present report is the third of the sort 
that has been issued by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion, the two preceding ones having appeared 
in 1876 and 1885, respectively. The report 



328 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



of 1876 included 3,649 libraries of over 300 
volumes, with an aggregate of 12,276,964 vol- 
umes. The report of 1885 included 5,388 
libraries above the same low limit of size, with 
an aggregate of 20,622,076 volumes. In the 
present report, all libraries of less than 1,000 
volumes have been ignored, and those above 
this limit number 3,804, with an aggregate of 
26,896,537 volumes. While these figures are 
doubtless sufficiently trustworthy to be used as 
a basis for general conclusions, our confidence 
in their entire accuracy is considerably impaired 
by the fact that careless compilation, or care- 
less proof-reading, has resulted in discrepancies 
which, to say the least, should never have been 
permitted in a government publication. Thus, 
Mr. Flint, the statistician who has compiled 
the report, gives us 3,649 libraries for 1876 
and 5,388 for 1885. But Dr. Harris, who 
prefaces the report with a " letter of trans- 
mittal " to the Secretary of the Interior, gives 
the numbers 3,647 and 5,338 for those years. 
Mr. Flint himself gives the number for 1891 
in one place as 3,804 and in another as 3,803. 
Again, his report of the aggregate number of 
volumes in 1891 gives us, in one place, the 
figures above quoted, and, in another place, 
figures differing from these by no less than 
70,000. It appears that Mr. Flint has neg- 
lected the very important duty of " proving " 
his results, unless the cause of his undoing 
is to be found in his failure to correct the 
proofs. 

The general outcome of this report is cer- 
tainly very gratifying. Taking the figures ab- 
solutely, it is interesting to learn that there 
are half as many books in public libraries as 
there are people in the United States, that the 
average size of the nearly four thousand libra- 
ries is nearly eight thousand volumes, and that 
such a collection of books is, on an average, 
within reach of every sixteen thousand men, 
women, and children. Making a comparison 
between the figures for 1891 and those for 
1885, we find in six years an increase of twenty- 
seven per cent in the number of libraries con- 
taining over a thousand volumes, and an in- 
crease of sixty-six per cent in their contents. 
When we consider also the great increase of 
private book-buying during recent years, it 
will be realized that our reading public is grow- 
ing very rapidly, and that it is by no means 
dependent, as is so often assumed, upon the 
newspapers for its intellectual sustenance. 

An examination of the statistics which re- 
port the size of our public libraries yields some 



interesting results, and also illustrates afresh 
the unpardonable carelessness of this report. 
The four largest libraries are the Congress- 
ional, the Boston Public, the Harvard Univer- 
sity, and the University of Chicago collections. 
The first three of these are reported as con- 
taining more than half a million volumes each, 
which is true only of the first two. The Har- 
vard Library is only brought into this class by 
counting its nearly three hundred thousand 
pamphlets. But in the report of the aggre- 
gate number of volumes contained in all our 
libraries, no pamphlets are counted. It is evi- 
dent that, if this principle is once adopted, it 
should be applied consistently in all the classi- 
fications which follow. The second group of 
libraries includes those having from one hun- 
dred thousand to three hundred thousand vol- 
umes, and in this class twenty-six are reported. 
Of these, seven are assigned to the State of 
New York, headed by the Astor and the Mer- 
cantile (less than a thousand volumes apart, 
and numbering nearly a quarter of a million 
each); four to Massachusetts; three each to 
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the District of 
Columbia ; two to Illinois ; and one each to 
Connecticut, Ohio, Michigan, and California. 
But an examination of the detailed reports of 
the libraries in question reveal the fact that 
pamphlets must be counted in the case of 
five of these collections, to make up the mini- 
mum number of one hundred thousand vol- 
umes; and that, in three instances, the pam- 
phlets are to the volumes nearly in the ratio 
of three to one. 

The geographical distribution of our libra- 
ries is a matter of considerable interest, and 
the report is very instructive upon this sub- 
ject. The New England and Middle States 
have more than half of the entire number, New 
York heading the list with 511, and Massachu- 
setts closely following with 508. Pennsylvania 
has 350, and Illinois (thanks to a liberal stat- 
ute) has 218. Ohio, Michigan, Connecticut, 
California, Indiana, and Missouri come next, 
in the order named. No other state has as 
many as a hundred, and ten states and terri- 
tories, mostly in the West, have less than ten 
libraries each. But none, not even Indian Ter- 
ritory, has less than three. And the library 
facilities of the West and South are increasing 
at a satisfactory rate. 

A few Canadian statistics are included in the 
present work. Over two hundred libraries are 
reported, three-fourths of them in the Province 
of Ontario, and the aggregate number of vol- 



1893.]

umes is 1,392,366. The Library of Parlia- 
ment at Ottawa heads the list with 150,000 
volumes, and that of Laval University, with 
100,000, comes next. Toronto is fairly well 
supplied with books, and Montreal not so well. 
A large proportion of the Canadian libraries 
belong to Mechanics' Institutes. 

It would be interesting, had we space for the 
purpose, to compile from this document the 
special statistics of school and college libraries, 
which would be found to contain a large frac- 
tion of the total number of books reported. 
Two of the four largest libraries belong to edu- 
cational institutions, as do also five of the 
twenty-six constituting the second group. It 
is probable that the college or school library is 
of more ultimate value to the community than 
the library of any other sort. Dr. Harris, in 
his introduction to the report that we have 
just had under consideration, gives us some 
very sensible words on the usefulness of the 
school library. We wish that he had not 
coupled them with certain high-sounding ob- 
servations upon the newspaper as an educa- 
tional agency of coordinate rank. With the 
person who reads the newspapers, we are told, 
" the correlation of the near and the remote, 
the custom of carrying in his mind the world 
affairs, develops a sort of epic consciousness 
vastly more educative than the former village 
gossip that prevailed in the tavern or in 
the shop. It elevates the individual into a 
higher plane of thinking, substituting the 
universal for the particular." We very much 
doubt its doing anything of the sort, although 
it might accomplish such a purpose if the daily, 
newspapers were what they ought to be. But 
that is another story. 

We cannot refrain, in conclusion, from ex- 
pressing a wish that the publications of our 
national government might be made a little 
more attractive in appearance than they are. 
Intellectual work of an excellent sort often 
goes to their preparation (as, with some reser- 
vations, in the present instance), but they are, 
mechanically, about as bad as it is possible for 
printed books to be. Government printing, 
like government architecture and a few other 
things bearing the official tag, has stood here- 
tofore for work of the cheapest and most taste- 
less sort. Sometime we shall take a lesson in 
this matter from, say, the French government ; 
this is one of the good things that may be 
hoped for when work for the public ceases to 
be regarded as a reward for services done to 
some political party. 



AN INSULAR COMMENT ON AN INTER- 
NATIONAL ENTERPRISE. 

When the British press starts out to display its 
provincialism, it easily outdistances the most zealous 
French or German competitors, and no one would 
deny its claim to the attribute of insularity in all 
the senses of that term. A beautiful illustration of 
this attribute, which Mr. Lowell so well knew how 
to satirize, is offered by the " Saturday Review" in 
a recent account of the Columbian Exposition. The 
article begins with the following paragraph: 

" The Chicago Exhibition has quietly come to an end, 
the tragic death of the Mayor of the city forming one 
sufficient reason for dispensing with closing ceremonies. 
Another may have been a general recognition by the 
Chicagoans that their show had to some extent fizzled." 

After this cheerful exordium, we have some re- 
flections upon the incompleteness of the Fair during 
its earlier weeks, and a few strictures, not altogether 
unjustified, upon the conduct of the directors in the 
matters of Sunday closing and the official system 
of awards. The article then goes on as follows : 

" The World's Columbian Exposition had no proper 
claims on the world's attention, and has therefore, very 
rightly, not been able to enforce any. It was a colossal 
show, and a fair number of people something under a 
million a week attended it, of whom a large portion 
went over and over again, the noughts on the millions 
being chiefly run up by the local crowds. But there 
was no reason why the whole world should attend, and 
it distinctly failed to do so. Dwellers in civilized places 
appear to have thought that they could see as much of 
the material side of the Exhibition as they desired in 
their domestic shop-windows. The great thinkers of 
the world paid no attention to the invitations of the 
Congress Auxiliary, a queerly named offshoot from the 
parent scheme, which begged them to attend in the Art 
Institute of Chicago, and supplement the material exhi- 
bition by ' a portrayal of the achievements of the age 
in science, literature, education, government, morals, 
charity, religion, and other departments of human activ- 
ity (!)' The landscape gardens of Jackson Park were 
chiefly thronged by American sight-seers, and the ses- 
sions of the Auxiliary Congress were, with but one 
exception, largely left to the self-advertising idiot and 
the blue-stocking woman. And the exception owed its 
partial success to the enthusiasm of an English man of 
letters." 

This is so delicious that it is not difficult to take 
good-humoredly some of the sallower things that 
follow the characterization of the "Exhibition" 
as " a local show," and of the citizens by whom its 
cost has been "amiably borne" as "the ignorant 
millionaire, the grain-man, the pig-man, the anar- 
chist, the Irish politician, and the dude who has 
bust [sic] and gone West," etc., etc. Of the White 
City itself which we now learn was called "the 
Elfin City, the City of White Palaces, the Western 
Venice, the Fairy (or preferably Faerie) City, the 
Dream City (for further variants see the Chicago 
press)," we are patronizingly informed that "the 
conventionally classical buildings had the good taste 
of their examples." The most preposterous fea- 



330 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



ture of the Exposition, from a British standpoint, 
seems to be the notion that the people who attended 
it were likely to derive any benefit therefrom. The 
idea cherished by its promoters the pig-man, ignor- 
ant millionaire, "bust" dude, and anarchist that it 
might "furnish an object-lesson in civilization," is 
thus borne down upon by this pot-casqued crusader : 
"In the thirteen great halls, stuffed with the produce 
of the world, there was much to be learned by every- 
body possessing the necessary curiosity and energy. 
Fishing-tackle and lime-juice preparations, electric plant 
and bulbs from Holland, crime statistics and furniture 
from Tottenham Court Road, canned goods and one 
thousand and seventy-five paintings by American artists, 
were all on view. But whether these things had a 
message for the intellectually starving of the West is 
very doubtful, and certainly such message was made 
no more distinct by the reiterated assertions of the 
press that they could understand it." 

Intelligent Americans, who are quite used to 
seeing in " Saturday Review " articles on American 
affairs an exhibition of John Bull at his worst, will 
of course find all this amusing enough. But we 
should hardly suppose it could prove amusing to 
intelligent and manly Englishmen. Mr. Walter 
Besant, for example, who has seen the Exposition 
for himself, and has lately made an impassioned 
appeal for greater cordiality between the two coun- 
tries, must find it pretty discouraging. 



THE TARIFF ON BOOKS. 

The publication of the Tariff Bill drafted by the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
Representatives comes too close to the issue of this 
number of THE DIAL to permit of our commenting 
upon it at any length, but we cannot refrain from 
an expression of amazement at the retention of the 
old duty upon English books published within twenty 
years from the date of importation. It is not within 
our province to discuss the general features of this, 
or of any, Tariff Bill; but it is our duty, as it is 
the duty of every journal interested in education 
and the advancement of culture, to protest against 
any embodiment, in our forthcoming tariff legisla- 
tion, of a tax upon knowledge, whether for the 
purpose of protection or of revenue. We had every 
reason to hope and believe that such survivals of 
barbarism as taxes upon the means of culture would 
be eliminated from our statute-book in the scientific 
revision of the tariff to which the party now in 
power is pledged. But Mr. Wilson's committee 
has seen fit, it now appears, to recommend for con- 
tinuance the twenty-five per cent duty upon English 
books. A more stupid duty could not be imagined ; 
as a means of raising revenue, it is despicable ; as 
a means of protection it is absolutely futile. It 
simply puts a needless difficulty in the way of stu- 
dents who wish to purchase such English books as 
are not copyrighted in this country. The books 
that are thus copyrighted are already protected by 



the copyright law itself. We hope that every 
scholar, every educator, and every person having 
intellectual interests of any sort, will join in a de- 
mand for the free admission of English books, as 
a feature of our new Tariff Law. Every such per- 
son should make an individual appeal to the Repre- 
sentative from his Congressional District ; unless 
some such concerted action is taken, we shall find 
that wool, and iron, and tin will absorb the atten- 
tion of the public to the exclusion of this very 
important matter. 



CONSUELO. 



I list to Consuelo as she sweeps 

With passionate touch the ivory organ-keys; 

Deep in the infinite her spirit sees 

Themes that the soul of lofty heaven keeps; 

Long-lineaged hope that to the zenith leaps, 

The joy of time, the secret key of woe, 

The passion ruling till its potence steeps 

The conquered Universe within its glow. 

O Consuelo! in thy music high, 

Thy vaguenesses, thy raptured spirit ear, 

Why not some echo of an earthly cry 

The soft, sweet sounds that men are used to hear? 

Cease to consort with what, like yonder star, 

Gleams unattained a splendor from afar. 

ii. 

Silent the keys, and Consuelo speaks: 
" O poor diviner of the inmost heart, 
Thou hast no knowledge of the higher art, 
Nor feel'st the ecstasy that in me leaps; 
Thou liest fain amid the silent steeps 
Where Araby her barren mounts displays, 
And o'er thy spirit with insistence creeps 
The dull delusion of our later days. 
The earth is wide, and wider than the earth 
Is Heaven rearing to the central sky; 
Think of beginning, think of death and birth, 
And of life's seeds that fusing long must lie. 
Sordid is care, and wealth of little worth, 
But the unseen can never dim nor die." 

W. R. PERKINS. 



A CORRESPONDENT of the London " Athenseuin " has 
sent to that journal the following sonnet by Wordsworth, 
which appeared originally in " The Morning Post " of 
October 10, 1803, and is believed to have been since 
unprinted. 

" I find it written of Simonides 

That travelling in strange countries once he found 
A corpse that lay expiring on the ground, 
For which, with pain, he caused due obsequies 
To be performed, and paid all holy fees. 
Soon after, this man's ghost unto him came 
And told him not to sail, as was his aim, 
On board a ship then ready for the seas. 
Simonides, admonished by the ghost, 
Remained behind; the ship the following day 

Set sail, was wrecked, and all on board was lost. 
Thus was the tenderest Poet that could be, 
Who sang in ancient Grece his loving lay, 
Saved out of many by his piety."

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



CREATIVE ART IN LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. John Burroughs, in his very interesting articles 
in your columns, complains that " our poets are more in 
love with poetry than with things." That may be be- 
cause they have nothing to say ; and if one has nothing 
to say, it is at least better that he should say it well 
than say it ill. In any case, if one cannot reach the 
best results by explicitly and of set purpose following 
art-methods, neither will he by explicitly and of set 
purpose ignoring these. 

Stated in the barest form, the requisites of literary art 
are, or would seem to be, first, that the artist have some- 
thing to say; and, second, that he say it well. Art in- 
cludes both of these, and in so far as one or other is 
lacking, thus far is the artist's power curtailed and his 
art defective. But while vast numbers aspire to art in 
literature, few aspirants combine both requisites ; and 
the rarity of this combination, which is one of nature's 
own making, has in the past as well as in our own day 
driven many into one or other of two extremes either 
to neglect form and finish, or to neglect idea and ethic. 
As regards the latter, there is in every art a technical 
element, and in literature, as in music and painting, 
there are those who mistake this technical element for 
the entire art. These commonly sing elegant trifles, 
because nature has given them nothing more serious or 
strong or valuable to utter ; and while they sing grace- 
fully, they are emphasizing one essential of true art in 
literature. 

In actual criticism, the above distinction takes one a 
very little way. Still, it is important to emphasize the 
second aspect of production, especially where we are so 
prone to haste; and though Poe had done nothing else, 
he deserves to be perpetually remembered for hav- 
ing insisted as he did upon the necessity of studying 
even the mechanical processes of creative art. These 
processes, however, are less merely mechanical than he 
suggested, for the artistic instinct is a part of " great 
creating nature," and its processes are a reflex of those 
that we see operating towards perfection of form and 
finish of detail throughout the material universe. The 
art to which they belong is an " art which nature 
makes." 

In addition to this, we must remember that art, in 
whatever sphere, implies not merely an objective result, 
but also a subjective process of mind ; and in this sub- 
jective creative process form and substance are so inter- 
blended that no absolute separation is possible. The 
embodied result, whether it be poem, picture, sympho- 
ny, or cathedral, will address itself to the intellectual 
perception of form, unity, and completeness; but its ap- 
peal will be charged with the emotional and ethical 
quality of the artist's own soul. This ethic is inevita- 
ble. The subject-matter of art is human life and hu- 
man interests ; and to exclude the ethic from a consid- 
eration of human life, or speak of life without an ethic, 
would be like speaking of a season without weather. 
It may be indifferent weather, but the weather is there ; 
and if the subject-matter of art is life which embodies 
an ethic, the only question is how art is affected by this 
ethic which life embodies. But, besides, the artist can- 
not, though he would, prevent the ethic of his own 
character from permeating the substance of his work. 
Just so the literature of any community or epoch is a 



reflex of the society which produces and enjoys it; and 
a noble and healthy life will idealize itself in noble and 
healthy imaginations, just as surely as an unclean or a 
blase society will occupy its mind with corresponding 
studies. In respect of creative literature, the ethic of 
art rightly considered, and the ethic of life in its high- 
est interpretations, will be found not only to move in 
the same course, but virtually to be identical in sub- 
stance. By virtue of its ethic, art will endeavor to es- 
chew what is unwholesome, just as nature endeavors to 
throw off disease and society to purge itself of social 
corruption. Being, as it were, the flower of the human 
instinct after perfection and permanence, it will turn 
its first desire to those ideas and imaginations that make 
for health, and will seek to embody them in creations 
which stir and appeal to all healthful emotions and to 
the sense of what is both beautiful and good.

CARDINAL NEWMAN VERSUS SE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Descanting on English Imperfects Passive, in the Ap- 
pendix to my "Modern English" (1873), I say, re- 
specting " the sort of phraseology under consideration," 
that " some of the choicest of living English writers 
employ it freely." I proceed: " Preeminent among these 
stands Dr. Newman, who wrote, as far back as 1846," 
etc. A single relevant citation from him is then adduced. 

Mr. R. O. Williams, iu your issue of September 1, 
takes exception to my qualifier "freely." He adds: 

"Although I have noticed two instances (one in a letter), 
besides the one cited above by Dr. Hall, where the ' imperfect 
passive ' was employed by Dr. Newman, yet I am confident 
that its use by him at least in print was very rare." 

In 1879, the Rev. Professor John Earle published 
what follows, from a letter addressed by Dr. Newman 
to the Rev. George Buckle: 

" It surprises me that my antipathy to ' is being ' existed 
so long ago. It is as keen and bitter now as ever it was, 
though I don't pretend to be able to defend it. ... Ration- 
ally, or irrationally, I have an undying, never-dying hatred to 
'is being,' whatever arguments are brought in its favor. At 
the same time, I fully grant that it is so convenient, in the 
present state of the language, that I will not pledge myself I 
have never been guilty of using it." 

Here we have Dr. Newman all over: a man with 
whom, avowedly, feeling had the ascendancy over 
reason; who could hate intensely, however valid the 
demonstration might be that he should not hate at all ; 
who, nevertheless, was not sure that his hatred, though 
" undying, never-dying," had not sometimes been in 
abeyance; and who could confess all this explicitly. 
But neither subtility nor learning is any warrant for 
ethical sanity. 

And why, one may ask, if imperfects passive are " con- 
venient in the present state of the language," would 
they not have been equally convenient in ages gone by ? 
His or it sufficed the contemporaries of Henry the 
Eighth, as a neuter possessive; but would its, if it had 
been evolved in their day, have proved to be less con- 
venient than it has proved to be for hard on three 
centuries ? 

As far back as 1838 I began the practice, which I 
have kept up ever since, of desultorily jotting down: 
notes on points of English. Of those notes, which for 
many years were made solely for my own instruction, a 
group stood me in good stead, when, in 1871, 1 drew up 



332 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



my paper on " English Imperfects Passive," and sent it 
to America, where it was published in " Scribner's 
Monthly " for April, 1872. At that time, satisfied, for 
the most part, analysis apart, with a chronological in- 
vestigation, and with showing that a noticeable array of 
authors already become classic Sonthey, Coleridge, 
Lamb, and Landor had not scorned the construction 
in question, I troubled myself but little to cite authori- 
ties for it of more recent date. It was from being re- 
minded how highly Dr. Newman was esteemed, for his 
style, among writers then living, that, on recasting 
my paper in 1873, I summoned him as supporting the 
form of locution therein discussed. A twelvemonth pre- 
viously when, in reading the first series of his " Essays 
Critical and Historical," I there encountered " are be- 
ing led " it occurred to me that I had not brought for- 
ward anything similar from him in my paper, and it 
also came back to me that I had, in the past, observed 
his use, repeatedly, of like expressions. Since 1872 I 
have hardly done more than casually dip into any of his 
writings, his posthumous Letters excepted. True as it 
is that I quoted him but once for imperfects passive, 
yet I was convinced, when doing so, that I might speak 
as I did of his lending them his countenance. My mem- 
ory, though I seldom trust to it, seldom plays me false. 

Not only are Dr. Newman's literary productions nu- 
merous, but the minor ones, of which many have not 
been collected, are widely scattered: not even the Cat- 
alogue of the British Museum guides one to anything 
like all of them. Still, as has been seen, Mr. Williams 
is " confident " that the occurrence, in them, of imper- 
fects passive is " very rare." He speaks of two appo- 
site quotations from them, besides that which I for- 
merly gave. If he had gone farther afield, he would 
have made the discovery that the eloquent visionary 
manifested, practically, nothing perceptible of the 
" hatred to ' is being ' " which he was so incautious and 
oblivions as to profess. 

Dr. Newman, in his letter quoted in a preceding par- 
agraph as well as by Mr. Williams, expresses himself as 
if, in his eyes, imperfects passive were things to be 
catholicly eschewed ubique, semper, et ab omnibus, 
and were on a par with, say, lay for lie, set for sit, and 
expect for suspect. The latter he would, no doubt, have 
held to be inexcusable, absolutely; but the former, de- 
spite his passionate reprobation of them, seem to have 
been rather attractive to him. Between 1832 and 1846 
he was, according to his own adjudication, "guilty of ": 

" I fear the Church is being corrupted by the union." (Let- 
ters [1891], Vol. I., p. 449.) 

" Yon are being taught to unlearn the world." (Ibid., Vol. 
II., p. 74.) 

"What a mass of Catholic literature is now being poured 
upon the public ! " (Ibid,, Vol. II., p. 252.) 

"Pusey was being worn out." (Ibid., Vol. II., p. 282.) 

"Every nerve is being exerted against Williams." (Ibid., 
Vol. II., p. 366.) 

"All that is dear to me is being' taken from me." (Ibid., 
Vol. II., p. 464.) 

It turns out, then, that Dr. Newman's "undying, 
never-dying hatred " of imperfects passive was, in all 
likelihood, a mere transient spasm of displacency, pos- 
sibly due to bile or indigestion. Alternatively, may not 
the abhorrent employment of them have served him as 
an act of penance, in lieu of cultivating fleas inside his 
shirt, or disciplining himself with a cat-o'-nine-taiis ? 

Copying passages where, besides signifying an em- 
phatic aversion to the late Bp. Wilberforce, I refer to 



somebody as having ridiculed him for using a term 
which that somebody characterizes as "jargon," Mr. 
Williams would have me, in the name of consistency, 
cancel my inclusion of the Bishop among " the choicest 
of living English writers." But, under favor, things 
entirely disparate are not to be confounded. " We find, 
we confess," comments Lord Macaulay, " so great a 
charm in Mr. Southey's style, that, even when he writes 
nonsense, we generally read it with pleasure, except, in- 
deed, when he tries to be droll." Why, pray, may not 
a man be, personally, ever so objectionable, and also go 
the length of venting the most indisputable balderdash, 
and yet be, as a rhetorician, a very model of excellence ? 
In the hope, apparently, of scoring a point of some 
sort against me, Mr. Williams allows himself in a rash 
venture, or something worse. He credits me with hav- 
ing contributed to the " New English Dictionary " the 
quotation in which Dr. Newman has " are being led." 
By so doing he assumes to know more than I know my- 
self. Even if he had ploughed with my heifer, he 
would not have discovered what he has stated as a fact. 
(See The Nation," Vol. XLIV., pp. 447-8.) Asmo- 
deus ought not to dispense with his spectacles. Nor, 
perhaps, would it be altogether amiss, if he redoubled 
his diligence of research. j\ jj_ 

Marlesford, England, Nov. 3, 1893. 

P. S. For expressions typified by " is being built " 
I could give, in 1873, only three quotations earlier than 
1800, namely, one dated 1795 and two dated 1797. I 
can now add to them others dated 1667, 1769, 1779, 
1782, 1784, 1785, 1786, 1788, 1792, 1795, and 1796 
(two). For the years between 1800 and 1820 I have 
similar quotations, not before spoken of, from Dr. T. 
Beddoes, Lord Byron, Sir J. C. Hobhouse, W. H. Ire- 
land, T. L. Peacock, and several anonymous novels. 
Imperfects passive have since been used by Dr. J. H. 
Appleton, Mrs. Sarah Austin, Sir C. Babbage, Mr. R. 
D. Blackmore, Sir John Bowring, Rev. J. S. Brewer, 
Rev. Dr. J. W. Donaldson, Archdeacon Farrar, Miss 
Caroline Fox, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, Lady Duff Gor- 
don, W. R. Greg, Rev. W. Gresley, Prof. John Grote, 
Mr. Frederic Harrison, Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Dr. W. 
B. Hodgson, A. J. B. Hope, J. R. Hope-Scott, Sir H. 
S. Maine, Rev. Dr. S. R. Maitland, Mr. W. H. Mai- 
lock, Cardinal Manning, Miss Harriet Martineau, J. S. 
Mill, J. C. Morison, Mr. John Morley, Prof. F. W. 
Newman, Laurence Oliphaut, Rev. FT E. Paget, Rev.

Rev. Dr. E. B. Pusey, Lord Salisbury, Mr. Goldwin 
Smith, Mr. Herbert Spencer, Sir J. F. Stephen, Mr. 
Leslie Stephen, Lord Strangford, J. A. Symonds, and 
many an author here unnamed. The evidence, in all 
these cases, is at hand. In George Eliot's "Romola" 
alone, the form of construction referred to is exhibited 
no fewer than thirty-nine times. 

Mr. Williams, in " Our Dictionaries," p. 139, pre- 
mising " 1800," advances the opinion that " from about 
that time . . . the innovation " presented in is being 
" must have spread with great rapidity." As a collo- 
quialism, it may have done so; but it certainly did not 
do so in books till as late as 1830, or somewhat later. 

" Was being done away " is offered, by the Bible re- 
visionists, as a variant rendering in II. Corinth., iii., 
7. Yet, in I. Peter, iii., 20, they have retained the now 
vulgar " while the ark was a preparing." 

To some, it is conceived, these particulars may be of 
interest. r

THE LIFE AXD LETTERS OF AIST AMERICAN 
NATURALIST.* 



While the " Letters of Asa Gray," recently 
issued under the editorship of Jane Loring 
Gray, appeal, prima facie, chiefly to the scien- 
tific reader, they will be found fairly rich in 
matter of general interest and entertainment. 
Happily, with Dr. Gray, intense devotion to a 
specialty did not result in a form of brain par- 
alysis as to interests outside of it. He was an 
enthusiastic traveller, a lover of art and of 
literature, and his letters and the records of 
his European journeys testify throughout to 
his liberal tastes and his lively concern in the 
bustling activities of the unlearned world about 
him. In point of style, the letters, while they 
lack that special literary charm which has its 
pictorial analogue in color, show the same 
excellent prose qualities of clearness and pre- 
cision that go to make the writer's botanical 
text-books the best of their kind. His corre- 
spondence with eminent co-workers, Darwin, 
De Candolle, Dr. Torrey, Hooker, and others, 
is, of course, well seasoned with scientific dis- 
cussion and comment ; and here his habitual 
effort at clear and full expression largely 
the fruit of much expository writing and lec- 
turing stands the lay reader in good stead. 

In making her selection, the editor has 
aimed to present the story of Dr. Gray's life 
as far as possible in his own words, and to 
this end she has prefixed to the " Letters " a 
brief " Autobiography " a dry abstract of the 
writer's early life, chiefly valuable for the 
glimpses it gives of his boyhood and His ances- 
try. Serious biographical deficiencies in the 
epistolary record are supplied by a running 
thread of editorial comment and rather full 
notes. 

Dr. Gray came, on his father's side, of that 
sturdy Scotch-Irish stock to which America 
owes so many strong men and excellent women. 
His early life was not without its privations, 
but he was of the right metal to bear them 
cheerfully at first and to turn them to account 
afterwards. Born in 1810 in Sauquoit, Oneida 
County, N. Y., his first recollections were of 
Paris Furnace Hollow, a neighboring village 
where his father had set up a small tannery. 
Of this establishment he retained some vivid 
recollections, especially those connected with

" the first use to which he was put," the driving 
round the ring of the old horse that turned 
the bark-mill, and the supplying the mill with 
its small grist of bark which, adds Dr. Gray 
with some feeling, was " a lonely and monot- 
onous occupation." He was sent to the district 
school at the age of three, and, later, to a small 
" select " school at Sauquoit, whence, at twelve, 
he went to the Clinton Grammar School, where 
he was drilled in the rudiments of Latin and 
Greek for two years, " excepting," he writes, 
" the three summer months, when I was taken 
home to assist in the corn and hayfield." From 
the Clinton school he was transferred (1825) 
to Fairfield Academy, Herkimer County, N. Y.; 
and at this point in his recital the Doctor 
pauses to say something of that " omnivorous 
reading which was, after all, the larger part 
of my education." History he " rather took 
to," but (like Kant) he especially delighted in 
voyages and travels. In the little circulating 
library at Sauquoit there were no plays, not 
even Shakespeare, but there was a comfortable 
sprinkling of novels ; and the future botanist 
spent many cheerful and not unprofitable hours 
over those honored favorites, " Rob Roy," 
"Quentin Durward," "The Children of the 
Abbey," and, notably, that soul-stirring pro- 
duction, " Thaddeus of Warsaw." Later, he 
obtained access to the Pho3nix Society library, 
of Hamilton College, which was especially 
"strong in novels." "I suppose," says the 
Doctor, without any apparent twinges of the 
scientific conscience, " that I read them every 
one." 

In the autumn of 1826 Dr. Gray (compelled 
to abandon the idea of going to college) entered 
the medical school at Fairfield; and here, dur- 
ing the winter of the following year, his tastes 
and energies were half-fortuitously turned into 
their final channel by the article in Brewster's 
" Edinburgh Encyclopedia " on " Botany " 
" a poor thing," he says, " but it interested 
me much." What the fatal map of Namur 
was to Uncle Toby, the article on Botany 
proved to be to Dr. Gray ; and thenceforward 
his progress was rapid. His interest in botany 
began thus, in midwinter, when he was out of 
reach, as he says, even of a greenhouse or of a 
potted plant. Early in the spring, however 
(1828), he sallied forth into the bare woods 
eager as a boy to his .first trout-stream and 
found, to his great joy, an early plant in flower, 
peeping through the dead leaves at the vanish- 
ing winter. This treasure he bore home, and, 
with the aid of Eaton's " Manual," he ran it

down to its name, Claytonia Virginica. " I 
was well pleased," he writes, " and went on 
collecting and examining all the flowers I could 
lay hands on. ... I began an herbarium of 
shockingly bad specimens." In the spring of 
1830 Dr. Gray became professor of natural 
sciences at Mr. Bartlett's School at Utica, and 
in the autumn of 1836 he was appointed cura- 
tor of the new Lyceum of Natural History, 
New York, whose hall was his home for a year 
or two. In 1838 he was appointed professor 
in the University of Michigan, with the under- 
standing that he was to have a year abroad. 
Of this first European journey a detailed and 
lively account is given in the letters and jour- 
nals already alluded to. On his return from 
Europe, in 1840, the University of Michigan 
not yet needing his services, he settled in New 
York to his work on the " Flora of North 
America" (already begun by his life-long 
friend, Dr. Torrey), and Parts 3 and 4 of Vol. 
I. were issued in June of that year. The au- 
tobiographical fragment closes abruptly about 
the period of Dr. Gray's acceptance (in the 
spring of 1842) of a chair at Harvard. He 
writes : 

" Sometime in January, 1842, 1 made a visit of two or 
three days to B. D. Greene in Boston; the first time I 
ever saw Boston. Came out one day to Cambridge, 
dined with his father-in-law, President Quincy ; the 
company to meet us was Professor Channing and Pro- 
fessor Treadwell. Sometime in April, I received a 
letter from President Quincy, telling me that the cor- 
poration of the university would elect me Fisher Pro- 
fessor of natural history if I would beforehand signify 
my acceptance. The endowment then yielded fifteen 
hundred dollars a year. I was to have a thousand and 
allow the rest to accumulate for a while. Meanwhile 
I was to give only a course of botanical lectures, in the 
second spring term, and look after the Garden. But 
more work was soon added. I came in July, in the 
midst of vacation, before Commencement, which was 
then in September; got lodgings, with room for my then 
small herbarium, in the house of Deacon Munroe." 

Of Dr. Gray's character and personality, the 
editor affords us some interesting glimpses. 
He was a singularly amiable, engaging man, 
alert, merry, animated, in touch with current 
life and thought, not at all the conventional 
Gelehrter (Erasmus in the study and Kaspar 
Hauser out of it) of the cloistered German 
type, yet not, it seems, without a touch of the 
artlessness in lesser practical matters that so 
often forms an agreeable foil to profound learn- 
ing. Deeply interested in the religious thought 
of the day, he was (like all thinking men who 
have the matter at heart) reticent as to his 
own religious feelings, and sensitive about any 
exhibition of them. He was a constant church- 



goer. When travelling, he always made Sun- 
day a resting day, and he would slip away 
quietly in the morning to find some place of 
worship. He enjoyed the Episcopal service, 
though early habit and training had made him 
a Presbyterian. He once wrote : 

" In fact, I have no more fondness for high Calviuistic 
theology than for German neology. . . . But I have 
no penchant for melancholy, sober as I sometimes look, 
but turn always, like the leaves, niy face to the sun." 

Reading between the lines here, one fancier 
that the hiatus above, if supplied, might per- 
chance contain a reference to the binding, if 
sometimes unwelcome, force of strict dialectics. 

We have alluded to the Doctor's character- 
istic alertness. Says the editor : 

" In the street he was usually on a half run, for he 
never allowed himself quite time enough to reach his 
destination leisurely. When travelling by coach and 
climbing a hill, he would sometimes alarm his fellow- 
travellers by suddenly disappearing through a window 
in his eagerness to secure some plant he had spied; his 
haste would not suffer him to open a door. As his 
motions were quick, so that he seemed always ready 
for a spring, so he found instant relaxation by throwing 
himself flat on the floor when tired, to rest, like a child." 

At the time of the Civil War, Dr. Gray 
threw himself into the current of discussion 
with his usual earnestness. His letters of the 
period ring with a fine, uncompromising patri- 
otism, and he put his own hand to the work so 
far as he was able. 

" A company of the men who were too old or other- 
wise incapacitated from going to the front was enlisted 
in Cambridge to guard the State Arsenal there, and 
also to be ready to be summoned in any emergency ; and 
he joined the ranks and was faithful in the drilling and 
every duty to which they were called." 

Like his friend Darwin, Dr. Gray was 
devoted to pets especially to "man's friend, 
the dog." His prime favorite was-the black- 
and-tan terrier " Max," an animal neither 
especially beautiful nor gifted, but interesting 
for its warm affection and the power it had 
of developing its intelligence. 

" To be near and to please his beloved master was 
enough for him. Anything his master did was right 
and to be submitted to. Max had conscience, but it did 
not restrain him from showing his vexation when left at 
home, by throwing Dr. Gray's hat and gloves, etc., on 
the floor; but his shame and penitence always betrayed 
him. It seemed as if the joy of his master's return had 
killed him." 

Max's pathetic demise is thus chronicled by 
his master in a letter to Darwin : 

" Let me add, being sure of your sympathy, that our 
poor dog Max peacefully breathed his last to-day, after 
a happy life of twelve or thirteen years. We are glad 
he lived till we returned, and greeted us with his absorb- 
ing and touching affection. In a few days came a par-

tial paralysis, some convulsions, and then a quiet and 
seemingly painless ending. He is immortalized in your 
book on Expression, and will live in the memory of his 
attached master and mistress." 

Passing on now to the letters, our remaining 
space shall be given mainly to citations from 
an interesting series classified by the editor as 
written to "Darwin and Others 1860-1868." 
Unfortunately, the letters written to Darwin 
previous to 1862 were destroyed save the 
one dated January 23, 1860, published in his 
" Life and Letters," and reprinted in the pres- 
ent work. Dr. Gray seems to have met Dar- 
win first in 1839, at the London College of 
Surgeons ; and, later, we read in Mrs. Gray's 
English journal (1851) of "an invitation to 
lunch from the Hookers, ' to meet Mr. Darwin, 
who is coming to meet Dr. Hooker ; is dis- 
tinguished as a naturalist.' ' " Mr. Darwin 
was a lively, agreeable person." 

" The Origin of Species " having appeared 
in 1859, the letters from which we quote were 
written while discussion of its main position was 
at a white heat. Writing to J. D. Hooker, Jan- 
uary 5, 1860, Dr. Gray says: 

" The principal part of your letter was high laudation 
of Darwin's book. 

" Well, the book has reached me, and I finished its 
careful perusal four days ago; and I freely say that 
your laudation is not out of place. 

" It is done in a masterly manner. It might well 
have taken twenty years to produce it. It is crammed 
full of most interesting matter, thoroughly digested, 
well expressed, close, cogent; and taken as a system 
it makes out a better case than I had supposed possi- 
ble. . . . 

" I doubt if I shall please you [in his review for ' Sil- 
liman's Journal '] altogether. I know I shall not please 
Agassiz at all. I hear another reprint is in the press, 
and the book will excite much attention here, and some 
-controversy. . . ." 

Writing to the author himself, January 23, 
1860, Dr. Gray says : 

" I hope next week to get printed sheets of my review 
from New Haven and send them to you, and will ask 
you to pass them on to Dr. Hooker. 

" To fulfil your request, I ought to tell you what I 
think the weakest, and what the best, part of your book. 
But this is not easy, nor to be done in a word or two. 
The best part, 1 think, is the whole, that is, its plan and 
treatment, the vast amount of facts and acute infer- 
ences handled as if you had a perfect mastery of them. 
I do not think twenty years too much time to produce 
such a book in. 

" Style clear and good, but now and then wants re- 
vision for little matters (p. 97, self-fertilizes itself, 
etc.). 

" Then your candor is worth everything to your cause. 
It is refreshing to find a person with a new theory who 
frankly confesses that he finds difficulties, insurmount- 
able at least for the present. I know some people who 
never have any difficulties to speak of. 



" The moment I understood your premises, I felt sure 
you had a real foundation to hold on. Well, if one ad- 
mits your premises, I do not see how he is to stop short 
of your conclusions, as a probable hypothesis at least. 

" It naturally happens that my review of your book 
does not exhibit anything like the full force of the im- 
pression the book has made upon me. Under the cir- 
cumstances I suppose I do your theory more good here, 
by bespeaking for it a fair and favorable consideration, 
and by standing noncommitted as to its full conclusion, 
than I should if I announced myself a convert; nor 
could I say the latter with truth. 

"Well, what seems to me the weakest point in the 
book is the attempt to account for the formation of or- 
gans, the making of eyes, etc., by natural selection. 
Some of this reads quite Lamarckian. The chapter on 
Hybridism is not a weak, but a strong chapter. You 
have done wonders there. But still you have not ac- 
counted, as you may be held to account, for divergence 
up to a certain extent producing increased fertility of 
the crosses, but carried one short, almost imperceptible, 
step more, giving rise to sterility, or reversing the ten- 
dency. ... I am free to say that I have never learnt 
so much from one book as I have from yours." 

Writing to R. W. Church, May 7, 1861, 
Dr. Gray defends and defines his review of 
" The Origin of Species " (" Darwiniana ") : 

" I am gratified, also, by your apprehending the 
spirit and object of my essay on Darwin so much bet- 
ter than many who write to me about it. All it pre- 
tends to is to warn the reckless and inconsiderate to 
state the case as it is; to protest against the folly of 
those who would, it would seem, go on to fire away the 
very ramparts of the citadel in defense of needless out- 
posts; and, as you justly remark, to clear the way for 
a fair discussion of a new theory on its merits and evi- 
dence.' We must use the theory a while in botany and 
in zoology, and see how it will work; in this way a few 
years will test it thoroughly. I incline to think that its 
principles will be to a certain extent admitted in science, 
but that, as Darwin conceives it, it will prove quite in- 
sufficient." 

In a letter to Darwin of October 10, 1860, 
the Doctor, alluding to British comments on 
American illiteracy, offers an amusing tu 
quoque : 

" Some of the representations of us in the English pa- 
pers would be amusing if they did not now do so great 
harm. One would think it was generally thought that 
there was no law and order here, nor gentlemanly con- 
duct, nor propriety of deportment among the poorer and 
laboring people. I wish you could come and see. As 
to such things, and as to intelligence, education, etc., 
I have sometimes thought of the picture one could draw 
from individual cases. Take one very confidentially 
for I would not hurt a really good fellow by expos- 
ing his ignorance of what he might be expected to know. 
Here we lately had a Cambridge graduate (F.L.S., and 
godson of an English baronet) who in one conversation 
let us know most frankly that he had no idea where 
Quito was, or that there were two houses of Congress 
in the United States, and was puzzled to know whether 
Boston, United States, time was faster or slower than 
that of Greenwich ! . . ." 

The following note may smack of irreverence

and of a disregard for constituted authority ; 
but we quote it for its humor : 

" There is some jolly science in the ' Saturday Re- 
view,' now and then; as in December 28, p. 665, where 
we are informed that icebergs ' are formed by the 
splashing of the waves on the coast of Labrador.' " 

In letters to Darwin written May 26 and 
July 21, 1863, we find some interesting refer- 
ences to Professor Owen : 

" Your letter on heterogeny is keen and good; Owen's 
rejoinder ingenious. But his dissent from your well- 
put claims of natural selection to attention and regard 
is good for nothing except on the admission of the view 
that species are somehow derived genealogically; and 
this I judge, from various of Owen's statements, that 
he really in his heart believes to be the case, and was 
(as I long ago intimated my suspicions) hunting about 
for some system of derivation, when your book came 
down upon him like a thunderclap." 

" I have been reading Owen's Aye-aye paper. Well, 
this is rich and cool ! Did I not tell you in the ' At- 
lantic ' long ago, that Owen had a transmutation theory 
of his own ! It is your Hamlet, with the part of Ham- 
let left out! But as you say now, you don't so much 
insist on natural selection, if you can only have deriva- 
tion of species. And Owen goes in for derivation on 
the largest scale. You may as well lovingly embrace ! 
Oh, it is rare fun ! . . ." 

In a note to Darwin, April 14, 1871, there 
are some humorous signs of yielding on the 
Doctor's part. " You have," he says, " such 
a way of putting things, and you write in such 
a captivating way. One can only say : Almost 
thou persuadest me to have been ' a hairy quad- 
ruped, of arboreal habits, furnished with a tail 
and pointed ears,' etc." 

Dr. Gray's critique of the popular little book 
called " How Plants Behave " is amusing : 

" By the hand of an old correspondent of yours, and 
cousin of ours, Mr. Brace, I send you a little book, 
which may amuse you, in seeing your ' own science 
adapted to juvenile minds. In some of those hours in 
which you can do no better than read, or hear read, 
' trashy novels,' you might try this instead. It will 
hardly rival the 'Jumping Frog,' and the like speci- 
mens of American literature which you first made known 
to us. . . ." 

We may fittingly close our perhaps rather 
too-Darwinian series of extracts with the fol- 
lowing note (embodying an important autobio- 
graphical fact) to Dr. G. F. Wright (1875) : 

"... A minister out in Illinois has written me, tak- 
ing me seriously to task for altering my opinion after 
the age of forty-five, and for abetting disorder, by sup- 
porting theories that disturb the harmony of opinion 
that ought to prevail among scientific men. 

" He is one of those people who think that if you 
shut your eyes hard, it will answer every purpose; in- 
deed, from the ease with which he confutes Darwinism, 
I suppose he finds no call even to shut his eyes." 

Convinced of the probable truth of Darwin- 



ism, and welcoming it as a good working hy- 
pothesis, the writer saw in it nothing to disturb, 
or, indeed, to trench upon, his religious beliefs. 
Matters of faith and matters of possible knowl- 
edge he kept separate and distinct, each in its 
own province. 

Dr. Gray's " Letters " are interesting and 
valuable not only through the eminence of 
the writer, but through that of the recipients 
the drift of whose replies is usually fairly 
inferable. The editor has done her work thor- 
oughly and well, and the publishers have con- 
formed to their usual standards. There are 
four good portraits of Dr. Gray (one of them 
"In his Study"), and a view of the Harvard 
Botanical Garden in 1893.

A NEW HISTORY OF POLITICAL, ECOXOMY.* 



Dr. Luigi Cossa's " Guide to the Study of 
Political Economy," translated into English at 
the instance of Jevons, has long maintained a 
high reputation in America. The " Introduc- 
tion to the Study of Political Economy," be- 
gun as a revision of the " Guide," but really a 
new work, is far more comprehensive and im- 
portant, and, as an interpreter of the history of 
the science, is, for English readers, without a 
rival. The " extraordinary extent and accuracy 
of Dr. Cossa's knowledge of the economic lit- 
erature of almost all nations," which Jevons 
noted in the " Guide," is here extended and 
deepened, and enriched by a luminous style full 
of felicitous, penetrating, and discriminating 
statements. In closeness of texture and in con- 
structive grasp the work is perhaps inferior to 
Ingram's "History of Political Economy"; 
but Cossa, though chatty and conversational in 
tone, is far more complete and necessarily in 
better perspective. 

The main part of the book is taken up with 
an historical review of economic doctrine from 
the earliest antiquity down to the latest manu- 
script treatises of the year 1893. This prodi- 
gious task, requiring for its successful perform- 
ance enormous learning, patient analysis, and 
intelligent sympathy, is so well done as to leave 
almost nothing to be desired ; and the earlier 
writings take their proper place as fragment- 
ary speculations. The order of economic de- 
velopment, the priority of ideas, the gradual 
and partial attempts at systematization, and

the flowering of the science in Adam Smith 
and his successors, are exhibited with great skill. 
The author's conception of current economic 
tendencies is also keen, and his analysis of cur- 
rent economic writings shows no lack of in- 
sight and critical grasp. Here, however, the 
reader's perspective is more or less lost, and 
naturally there will be less agreement with the 
author's judgments. Throughout, there are 
many felicitous characterizations, as, for ex- 
ample, of the economy of the churchmen (p. 
138), of the mercantile system (p. 207), of pro- 
tection stumbling upon the unity of all indus- 
trial action (p. 240). 

Not less suggestive is the theoretical side of 
the book. The mooted points of definition, re- 
lation to other branches of knowledge, char- 
acteristics, terms, and method, are treated with 
thoroughness and moderation. The author is 
not an economic eclectic, but belongs to the 
militant wing of the reformed classical school. 
Much of the vigor and sustained power of the 
book undoubtedly comes from his steady ad- 
herence to the point of view ; and this also 
marks its limitations. 

There is no better place anywhere to study 
the excellences and defects of the new classical 
school. Cossa does not believe that a single 
position won by orthodox economy has been 
surrendered. "Fifteen years ago waverers stood 
trembling by while skeptics predicted the ruin, 
total and immediate, of English economics. 
But facts are stubborn things, and facts have 
gone against them" (p. 354). But English 
economy is not the thing it has been popularly 
represented to be. The extravagant assump- 
tions and deductions of the earlier and middle 
years of the century are unceremoniously dis- 
carded. Indeed, these assumptions and deduc- 
tions, he tells us, were never really justified by 
the classical writers. It is not the fault of Mal- 
thus and Ricardo that they failed to make them- 
selves understood. The " Manchester School " 
is a German myth (pp. 361, 369); Bastiat, 
with his physiocratic notions of " indefinite pro- 
gress," and some few second-rate writers, are 
its real representatives. ''Laissez-faire is any- 
thing but a scientific dogma. It is nothing but 
a hypothesis in social economics, and in polit- 
ical economy it is a rule of art, subject as such 
to noteworthy exceptions" (p. 104). The 
" all sufficiency of enlightened selfishness " goes 
by the board. " Another serious error of Ques- 
nay's school was their assertion of laissez-faire 
as a scientific axiom, when it is no better than 
any other rule of thumb, and requires frequent 



violation in cases where otherwise there would 
be collision between private interests and the 
common weal" (p. 271). Of the economic 
struggle in England during the present century, 
for whose attitude toward it the classical school 
has been so severely censured, he says : " Many 
vexatious and outward forms of governmental 
interference were abrogated, to the delight of 
all, while little account was taken of doctrinaire 
scruples in favor of laissez-faire" (p. 325). 
The " healthy liberty favored by the classical 
school" thus disarms criticism, while the "hard- 
and-fast dogmatism of laissez-faire defended 
by the optimists "(p. 400) and the " barbaric lit- 
eralness of Spencer " (p. 362) are made to serve 
as scapegoats ; and he speaks of Berardi, " who 
compounded out of Ferrara and Herbert Spencer 
a deadly decoction of laissez-faire " (p. 506). 

The main premises of the classical school are 
given on page 74. These are, first, the law of the 
least sacrifice. In economic functions the lead- 
ing motive of average human action is profit 
and loss, which prompts us to aim at the greatest 
gain in return for the least possible expenditure 
of effort, sacrifice, and risk. Second, the law 
of diminishing returns. Third, the law of 
population man's proneness to multiply upon 
the earth beyond the means of subsistence. 
These, taken together with hypothetical free 
competition, are the basis of the deductive 
theories of the classical school. Attention is 
called to the accidental and various causes 
which science neglects, but which rarely fail 
to traverse the foreseen results of constant 
causes (p. 75). Cossa's definition of the sci- 
ence is much broader than the traditional one. 
"Not wealth, which is but a complex and 
shifting sum of material goods, but man's 
business with wealth, is the subject-matter of 
political economy" (p. 10). Pure and ap- 
plied economics are rigidly separated. " Pure 
economics explains phenomena for which it is 
not responsible, and which it cannot alter." 
" The field of a science is one thing, and the 
rules of an art are another" (p. 28). " It is 
one thing to determine fair wages, . . . but 
it is quite a different thing to state in a strictly 
and scientifically correct fashion the economic 
theory of wages " (p. 13). The reformed clas- 
sical school, however, is willing to concede 
that there is such a legitimate thing as applied 
economics, and, granting its main contention 
regarding the function and method of pure 
economics, it is ready, as Cossa shows, to take 
a very generous view of the importance of the 
art of political economy.

THE DIAL 



[Dee. 1, 



" Ethical considerations modify in various ways the 
action and reaction of profit and loss, which is the chief 
force in economic phenomena taken in the concrete " 
(p. 29). " Applied economics must rank as subsidiary 
and inferior to ethics, because the attainment of no purely 
economical advantage can justify a violation of ethical 
principles. Wealth is only a means to the end of pre- 
serving man and bringing him to ethical perfection. Ac- 
cordingly, in any partial conflict between ethical and 
economic motives the former must prevail. For in- 
stance, the employment of child-labor in factories would 
be regulated by State interference on ethical grounds, 
even if there were no other reason or justification what- 
ever for interference " (p. 30). 

This is a very different classicism from what 
we were accustomed to hear expounded in the 
school-room a generation ago. Yet, with all its 
modifications, it re-affirms the fundamental 
premises of the classical school, and these, 
Cossa believes, cannot be seriously shaken. 
Ethical considerations modify in various ways, 
" but Dargun cannot be right in asking any- 
one to build up a new economics based upon 
sympathy or on love for one's neighbor " (p. 
29). Indeed, this idea of substituting the 
Golden Rule for the economic motive of self- 
interest is to Cossa unthinkable. 

" Grant to the socialists their delusive dream, wipe 
out of existence wealth as a social system, humor them 
and allow that injustice is inherent in the exercise of 
liberty, which brings inevitable pauperism and constantly 
recurring crises wherever it goes, what will socialism 
thus humored to the full of its bent do for you ? It 
will create a system of economic policy tending wholly 
to eliminate or at least partially to paralyze private 
property and competition. What experience have we of 
any system of economic order which does not hinge upon 
these two cardinal institutions in the established order 
of to-day ? " (p. 516). 

Alas ! alas ! And yet there are those among 
us foolish enough to contemplate such a possi- 
bility without a shudder, and to dream, in spite 
of Cossa's fantastic anathema (p. 515), of that 
time when the Kingdom of Heaven shall really 
come on the earth!

edging our debt to the translator for the ad-

LIFE WITH TRANS-SIBERIAX SAVAGES.* 

In Mr. Douglas Howard's little book, " Life 
with Trans-Siberian Savages," we have a 
sketchy all too sketchy account of expe- 
riences among that most interesting people, the 
Ainu of Saghalien. Our author claims to 

*LIFE WITH TRANS-SIBERIAN SAVAGES. By B. Douglas 
Howard. New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



have lived with them, to have tilted in medical 
contest with their Shaman, to have been in- 
ducted into a chieftaincy. These are unusual 
advantages, and we are justified in expecting 
much new matter from his pen. He himself 
realizes this, and trusts that his book will be 
" found both interesting and instructive to the 
general as well as to the scientific reader." 
Unfortunately, however, he adds little to our 
actual knowledge of the Ainu. 

Mr. Howard shows himself unacquainted 
with the history of exploration among the 
Ainu. It is scarcely true that no one has 
written about the Saghalien Ainu for nearly 
three hundred years. Batchelor's book appears 
to have suggested Howard's name for the peo- 
ple of whom he writes. Most authors speak 
of Ai'no or Aino, of A'mos or Ainos : Batch- 
elor insists that we should say Ainu, and uses 
the same form in singular and plural. How- 
ard, however, uses Ainus for a plural a rather 
unwarranted proceeding. 

There is much yet to learn of the physical 
characteristics of the Ainu, and Mr. Howard 
might have made observations, a report of 
which would have great value and interest. 
But he does not add anything to our knowl- 
edge in these respects. The description of the 
first Ainu he saw will show how little exact 
science may gain from him. He says : 

""The flesh-tint of this human phenomenon was that 
of pale Turkish tobacco; the frame massive; face large, 
stupid, blank, expressionless; forehead low, and almost 
concealed by a mass of hair as black and shiny as a 
highly polished boot. This was parted, with much evi- 
dent care, exactly in the middle, and hung loosely over 
the shoulders after the fashion of Eve by the old mas- 
ters." 

There is another page full of similar descrip- 
tion. Here and there, in his narrative of inci- 
dents of travel, not unpleasantly told, we gather 
bits of interesting ethnographic matter. A vil- 
lage is described ; food and cookery, dress, 
fishing, hunting, the use of inaos, treatment of 
disease, care of the dead, are matters referred 
to more or less fully. No one, so far as we 
know, gives so good a description of friction- 
made fire among Ainu : 

" A rough little apparatus was produced, consisting 
of two little blocks of wood. Between these was placed 
a bit of very dry elm stick, one end, which we will call 
the lower end, being pointed so as to fit loosely into a 
hole in the lower block; the other end, also pointed, 
being in contact only with the flat under surface of the 
upper block. A bow was then unstrung at one end, 
the string was passed once round the middle of the dry 
stick, and the free end was loosely re-attached. The 
bow was then worked with wonderful celerity, until the 
lower end of the stick first smoked, and then passed

into a fitful blaze. This was communicated to some 
fine dry twigs." 

The fish-skin suits worn in Saghalien are de- 
scribed as thin, tough, and pliable, elaborately 
but coarsely embroidered. The use of dogs 
by the Ainu is more fully treated than by 
other writers. The dog of the Ainu is of the 
size of a foxhound, but has a much smaller 
head and is lighter built. Of a sandy color, 
darkening along the back, he is in form some- 
what like the wolf or fox. His gait is wolfish 
and his appearance stupid and selfish. These 
creatures, half -wild, filthy, acting as scavengers, 
displaying no fondness for man and only kept 
at work by hunger, are yet of great import- 
ance to the Ainu of Saghalien. They are used 
in fishing, in driving deer, in hunting bears, 
in drawing sledges. Although never tied, they 
do not stray, and when working they are al- 
ways in packs or bands. Their use in fishing 
is novel, and is well-described. A fishing party 
started for the sea with about thirty dogs. Ar- 
rived at the scene of action, dogs and men were 
separated into two parties stationed at points 
two hundred yards apart. At a given signal 
the dogs plunged boldly into the water and 
swam out single file in two columns. At a sig- 
nal they wheeled toward each other, and when 
they had completed a crescentric line turned in 
toward the shore. As they drew near the land 
and the line contracted, fishes were driven in 
to shallow water. Here the dogs seized them 
and brought them to their masters. From 
Mr. Howard's description of the bear-hunt it 
appears that the animal's throat is severed im- 
mediately after he is killed ; the heart is re- 
moved, and the blood-vessels are opened. Mr. 
Howard twice refers to message sticks. There 
are reasons why fuller details regarding these 
would have been of great interest. 

Possibly the most interesting ethnographic 
item is in reference to the preparation of ar- 
row poison. Mr. Howard claims to have been 
regularly instructed in this art. Aconite roots, 
carefully cleaned and scraped, were sliced and 
pounded to a powder. This was placed in 
water, and boiled until two-thirds of the fluid 
had evaporated. It was then strained, and still 
further reduced by boiling. The residue was 
placed in a sea-shell. Six dead spiders were 
then powdered, put into water, and boiled down. 
This was put in a second shell. The gall bladders 
of three freshly-killed foxes were then taken, 
and the gall boiled down and put in a third 
shell. The two valves of a bivalve were now 
carefully cleaned. In one of them the three 



materials were carefully mixed with a little 
spatula of bone or wood. The unmixed mate- 
rials and the mixture were both sanctified by 
ceremonies before the sacred whittled sticks or 
inaos. After testing the mixture by dipping the 
tip of a spear of grass into it and touching it 
to the tongue, the upper valve was adjusted to 
the one containing the poison and the edges' 
were gummed together. It is when we read a 
description as exact as this that we most regret 
that our author has not given us more of value. 
It happens that the Ainu just now are at- 
tracting considerable attention. Batchelqr's 
wonderfully good book on the Ainu of Yezo is 
recent. Now we have this volume of Howard's, 
and very lately David MacRitchie's work, " The 
Ai'nos," appeared. This last, a very curious 
and interesting book, is by a man who has not 
seen the Ainu himself. It consists of the re- 
production of a remarkable series of Japanese 
drawings and paintings of Ainu, with some 
notes and remarks upon the people and their 
customs as therein shown. The pictures (the 
originals of which are in various European 
museums of ethnography), printed in their 
original colors, fill nineteen quarto plates and 
represent many interesting scenes. One con- 
stantly wonders at the fidelity and truth of 
most of these Japanese artists, even in minute 
details. We have, carefully delineated, the 
dress, ornaments, houses, mats, boats, inaos. 
We have, scrupulously depicted, movements, 
gestures, feasts, hunts, all occupations. Where 
ethnographic details are so elaborately worked 
out we are justified in expecting in these quaint 
pictures some data regarding the physical char- 
acteristics, which Howard fails to give us ; and 
these we find in MacRitchie's book. These 
artists of Japan represent the Ainu with hairy 
body, shaven heads, skin diseases on the head. 
They also picture them with curiously irregu- 
lar feet furnished with claw-like nails and with 
a curiously deep fold in the sole of the foot. 
MacRitchie calls attention to these peculiarities, 
and finds in them the basis for a theory of the 
primitive Ainu. He believes that these were 
less human than any savage people now living. 
It is interesting to put with this Mr. Howard's 
suggestion that the Ainu are " straggling Ary- 
But much yet remains to be done, before 



ans. 



the origin of the Ainu is settled. Men who 
work more carefully than Mr. Howard must 
repeat his " life among trans-Siberian savages " 
before we shall know much about Saghalien 
Ainu. Oh, for a Saghalien Batchelor !

RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. E. F. Benson's " Dodo " shows us that 
the son of an Archbishop of Canterbury may 
display a bent anything but ecclesiastical, or 
even ethical. It also shows us that the writer 
is a keen observer of things and men (includ- 
ing women), and that he has no little sense of 
humor. Dodo is a delightfully wicked crea- 
tion, although we cannot take her quite as se- 
riously as the author would evidently have us 
do. She clearly belongs to the world of con- 
ventional art of which Lamb discoursed in his 
essay on the dramatists of the Restoration ; a 
world that lies apart from the one in which we 
actually live, a world whose people may do and 
say what they please without the remotest dan- 
ger of influencing the conduct of anybody in 
the real world. A large part of the book sim- 
ply reports Dodo's conversation, of which the 
following is a good example : " Yes, I know, 
but you do me an injustice. I shall be very 
good to him. 1 can't pretend that I am what is

that people get in a very ridiculous state, and

yes, and keep withered flowers and that sort of 
thing. Ah, Jack, I wish that I really knew 
what it did mean. It can 't be all nonsense, 
because Chesterford 's like that, and he is an 
honest man if you like. And I do respect and 
admire him very much, and I hope I shall make 
him happy, and I hear he 's got a delightful 
new yacht ; and, oh ! do look at that Arbuth- 
not girl opposite with a magenta hat. It seems 
to me inconceivably stupid to have a magenta 
hat. Really, she 's a fool. She wants to at- 
tract attention, but she attracts the wrong sort." 
This sort of thing is almost preternaturally 
clever, and there is a great deal of it in the 
book ; in fact, there is little else that arrests 
the attention. But it palls after a hundred 
pages or so, and most of the other characters 
are lay figures. " Dodo " has been, we under- 
stand, a great success in England, which is not 
surprising, but it will be equally surprising to 
find anybody reading it a few years hence. It 
has the meteoric quality of such books as " Mr. 
Isaacs " and " Helen's Babies," and its bril- 
liancy is but for the hour. 

Mrs. Steel is the latest accession to the ranks 
of the writers from whom we are at last learn- 
ing what manner of people the East Indians 
really are. Mr. Kipling has done much to dis- 
abuse the public of conventional prejudices 
concerning the Indian Empire and its popula- 
tion, and Mrs. Steel's work is planned upon 
similar lines. The fault of these writers is that 
they take too much for granted an acquaintance 
with the Anglo-Indian vocabulary, that they 
are in a certain degree obscure, if not from in- 
tention, at least from lack of consideration for 
their public. " Miss Stuart's Legacy" is an 
exceptionally instructive and interesting tale. 
Its native characters have all the appearance 
of faithful studies of the types which they rep- 
resent ; we may safely assume them to be in 
all the essentials trustworthy. The English 
characters are equally well done, and one of 
them John Raby is very nearly a triumph. 
He is the evil genius of the story, but the au- 
thor has resisted the temptation to paint him 
wholly in black ; he deserves, at times, a con- 
siderable share of our sympathy, and the half- 
tone sketch of his commonplace character illus- 
trates the old truth that the treatment, rather 
than the type selected, is what makes a char- 
acter interesting. 

Mr. Howells has always had a pretty taste 
in titles, and "The Coast of Bohemia," by 
its name alone, brings pleasurable anticipa- 
tions. Nor are they doomed to disappointment 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



341 



in this instance, for the story is pleasing in all 
its aspects. The Bohemia upon whose coasts 
it bids us linger is the somewhat sophisticated 
and denationalized Bohemia of the New York 
art schools and studios ; the flavor of its life is 
very different from that of the enchanted re- 
gion which Murger opened for us, but its ways 
are engaging if decorous, and its denizens are 
very much alive while not too much in earnest. 
We do not discover among them any of the queer 
creatures that we have rather learned to expect 
in a novel by Mr. Ho wells for once those crea- 
tures with their fads seem to have been shelved 
but find merely a little group of humanly in- 
teresting men and women, leading lives rational 
in the main, and brought into relations which 
elicit the author's best powers of serious anal- 
ysis, relieved by touches of his dry and delight- 
ful humor. The manner is still that of real- 
ism, but a realism not too exclusive of the 
methods of art, and capable of giving the name 
of Charmian to one of the characters, no slight 
concession to the enemy. Moreover, the story 
is essentially a love-story, and it comes to the 
proper conclusion of love-stories, although there 
is one period of suspense when, knowing the 
perverse capabilities of the writer, the reader 
wonders if it really is going to end anywhere. 
It is well that there should be searchings of 
soul, but it is not well that they should rob 
stories as Mr. Howells sometimes permits 
them to of their legitimate endings. 

Realism still more unrelieved than in the 
case of Mr. Howells is to be found in " The 
Copperhead," Mr. Harold Frederic's new novel. 
But in this case it portrays a type and a set of 
conditions of great historical and social inter- 
est, and we may hardly make of its fidelity to 
fact a matter of reproach. The lot of the 
Northern man who, during our Civil War, 
openly professed his sympathy with the South- 
ern cause was made hard for him in a variety 
of ways, and of this Mr. Frederic has given us 
a very vivid illustration in the character of 
Abner Beech, the New York farmer. Toler- 
ance for the political opinions of the other party 
was, during that period of riotous passions, as 
unknown a quantity, either North or South, as 
was any form of religious tolerance to the Con- 
gregationalist of Puritan New England. Mr. 
Frederic has chosen to tell the story of his 
" copperhead " in the words of a boy who was 
growing towards manhood during the eventful 
years of the Rebellion, and we fancy that the 
author has put not a little autobiography into 
the narrative. The story is so naturally and 



unaffectedly told that it is difficult to believe 
it entirely " made up " by the novelist. 

" Marion Darche " will add nothing to Mr. 
Crawford's reputation. That skilled and ver- 
satile novelist could hardly fail to construct a 
plot of a certain degree of interest, to give 
life-like portraiture to the characters, and to 
tell his story in the literary way. These things 
he has done in the present instance, but they 
are not sufficient to lift the work above the 
level of mediocrity. We understand that " Ma- 
rion Darche " is written as a sort of pendant 
to a play upon the same theme, and the in- 
fluence of the dramatic manner is apparent in 
a number of scenes. It is also shown by an 
absence from the book of that padding in the 
use of which Mr. Crawford has been so great 
a sinner. His villain is really too despicable 
for probability, a defect which will be still 
more evident before the footlights than upon 
the printed page. 

Mr. Jackson's " The Son of a Prophet " is 
so serious and so ambitious a piece of work 
that we regret to describe it as failing to inter- 
est. But the most inveterate reader of historic 
fiction finds it hard to follow the tangled thread 
of the narrative or to project himself by its aid 
into the unfamiliar scenes and times with which 
it is concerned. These times are those of King 
Solomon, and the main purpose of the author 
is stated as " an attempt to create the character 
which uttered itself in the Book of Job, and to 
trace certain conditions, political, intellectual, 
and spiritual, which compelled this utterance." 
In assigning the composition of Job to this pe- 
riod, Mr. Jackson is undoubtedly in the line of 
the best critical opinion, and his book through- 
out has the marks of wide and careful scholar- 
ship. It contains eloquent pages also, and, 
considered in any other aspect than that of a 
work of fiction as a religious or historical 
study for example it deserves high praise. 
But the reader of novels wants his history 
more diluted and his religion more animated 
than he will find them in " The Son of a Pro- 
phet," and we would not lure him on to disap- 
pointment by concealing the shortcomings of 
the work, as they exist from his standpoint. 

" Ivar the Viking " hardly pretends to be a 
work of fiction. Taking for his theme the life 
of a fourth century Norseman, Mr. Du Chaillu 
gives us a reconstruction of the typical viking 
character, showing us his hero in all the rela- 
tions of life, from the cradle to the grave. The 
book is really an archaeological treatise in dis- 
guise. That the author was competent to han- 



342 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1 



die this subject is not to be questioned ; few 
men, even among Scandinavian antiquarians, 
have so thoroughly qualified themselves, by 
mastery of the materials, for such a work. Mr. 
Du Chaillu once more asserts his pet theory 
that the English people are of Norse rather 
than Saxon descent a theory to which he 
clings undeterred by the fact that it practically 
finds no acceptance among serious scholars 
and devotes a lengthy preface to its defence. 
Even Mr. Gladstone is invoked, and a letter 
is reproduced in which that versatile politician 
thus expresses himself : " When I have been 
in Norway, or Denmark, or among Scandina- 
vians, I have felt something like a cry of na- 
ture from within, asserting (credibly or other- 
wise) my nearness to them." This is interest- 
ing, but hard-headed men of science will find it 
about as convincing as the same writer's vagaries 
in Homeric speculation. But Mr. Du Chaillu's 
hobby does not materially hurt his book, which 
is to be commended for its vivid portraiture of 
an age and a race among the most interesting 
known to history. 

Mrs. Burton Harrison contrives to put into 
her work a sweet and wholesome quality that 
is not common in fiction, least of all in fiction 
that has to do with the artificial life of " so- 
ciety " in the narrow sense. She almost per- 
suades us that " society " has enough human 
interest to be worth writing about ; at all events, 
she convinces us that real human beings are 
sometimes found among the followers of its 
ignoble ideals. The sort of " society" to which 
we are introduced by such a book as " Sweet 
Bells Out of Tune " could not be adequately 
described without a sense of its " humors," or 
without a readiness to satirize its trivial pre- 
occupations. Mrs. Harrison has both this sense 
and this readiness, and her book, in conse- 
quence, has much of the higher truthfulness 
of art. This becomes very apparent when we 
contrast it with novels that take " society " 
seriously with Mrs. Cruger's books, for exam- 
ple. How animated is Mrs. Harrison's style, 
and how exceptionally entertaining she can be, 
is particularly well illustrated by the interna- 
tional episode near the close of the present story. 
A wealthy social struggler from America is 
seeking entrance to London " society," and has 
planned a " function " which a titled English 
dowager graciously consents to superintend. 
We quote a delightful conversational passage : 

" ' The best way for you to know America is to visit 
it yourself some day,' said Mrs. Vane-Benson politely. 

"'Me? God forbid! ' said the dowager. ' We must 



have all one kind of flowers in the big saloon ; foxgloves, 
perhaps, or orchids does your friend know orchids ? 
And there must be plenty of champagne. Your friend 
must be made to understand beforehand about cham- 
pagne.' 

" ' We drink champagne by the gallon in America,' 
retorted Mrs. Vane-Benson in desperation. 

" ' Oh, I think not,' said Lady Shorthorn without a 
change of expression on her large, fair face. ' It would 
make you so very sick. Lord Midlands himself told 
me when he dined at your er ah chief palace, you 
know the White House yes, a few years ago they 
gave him Apollinaris only, and handed boiled milk with 
the coffee, in large cups, during dinner. You see, I've 
made quite a study of America.' 

" I suppose, when you get everything arranged for 
the ball,' resumed Mrs. Vane-Benson, struggling no 
more, ' it will be well to let the newspapers have a list 
of the expected guests.' 

" ' Perhaps; it don't signify who reads newspapers? ' 
said her ladyship, comfortably. 'There are so many 
things in them one really can't believe. Imagine one 
of them saying, the other day, that your Mr. What's- 
his-name had taken Guelph House for the season, and 
if he liked it, after staying here a while, he would 
probably buy England. Now, fancy buying England 
how could he, possibly ? ' ' 

A simple love-story, told with good taste in 
excellent English, with a distinct undertone of 
ethical meaning, is given us in " The Petrie 
Estate." The substance of the story is famil- 
iar enough ; the estate in question, by reason 
of a misplaced will, goes, first to her, then to 
him, and finally to both. The charm of the 
book consists, first, in the style, then in the no- 
bility of the two chief characters, and, finally, 
in the poetic touch of the closing chapter, which 
gives us a glimpse of the happy pair upon the 
great stairway of the Louvre, their attention 
arrested by the Samothrace Victory, seeing in 
that glorious figure some sort of concrete em- 
bodiment of the ideals toward which their lives 
have been set. The story is unpretentious, but 
pleasing and wholesome. 

Mrs. Catherwood's " The White Islander " 
seems to us the most exquisite piece of work 
that the writer has yet done. Its effects are 
produced by broad strokes of the brush, and 
the canvas must be kept at a suitable distance 
in order that their real truth and harmony may 
become apparent. Readers of the photographic 
sort of current fiction will need to readjust 
their vision if they would get the proper effect 
of Mrs. Catherwood's subtle impressionism. 
The " white islander " is an orphaned French 
maiden protected by an Indian chief who has 
planned to make her his wife. The Island of 
Mackinac, as it was in the old days before the 
white man had taken possession of its beauti- 
ful shores, is the scene of the story, and the 



1893.] 



THE DIAL

freshness and fragrance of a primitive world 
breathes from many a descriptive passage upon 
the reader's transported sense. A sweet and 
simple love story is the central theme of the 
narrative, relieved by venturous episodes and 
thrilling escapes from peril. We fancy that 
Mrs. Catherwood's Indians are sometimes 
shown in too romantic, or at least artificial, a 
light, but it must be remembered that inter- 
course with priests and traders had already 
begun upo:i them the work of sophistication. 
The study of the chief Wawatam, in whose 
breast barbaric and civilized instincts struggle 
for the supremacy, is certainly well conceived 
and finely executed. The illustrations of the 
story, mostly simple figures, are very attractive. 

" Pastorals of France " and " Renunciations" 
are the titles of two collections of stories by 
Mr. Frederick Wedmore ; the first of them 
published as long ago as 1877, the other during 
the present year. Both collections are now re- 
published in a single exquisite volume. There 
are but three stories in each set, and the second 
of the two titles might fitly have been given to 
the entire volume, for each of the stories is a 
study of renunciation, imposed either by duty 
or social conditions ; or, in one case, by nothing 
more imperative than an over-exacting aesthetic 
sense. In each of the six it is love that is re- 
nounced, and in the last of them both love and 
life are yielded up together. This last story, 
with its impressive picture of the two lovers, 
in the presence of imminent death free at last 
to declare themselves, is a minor masterpiece 
upon the theme of Kenan's famous " Abbesse 
de Jouarre." It is a curious coincidence, by 
the way, that the last of the stories in Mr. 
Aldrich's volume also touches upon this theme. 
Mr. Wedmore's three French " pastorals " are 
very subtle of workmanship, and very truthful 
in their realization of provincial types. Their 
pathos is subdued rather than poignant, but is 
without trickery or artificiality, and absolutely 
simple and genuine. One may read many vol- 
umes of the best current fiction without encoun- 
tering as fine a literary art as Mr. Wedmore 
displays in this collection. 

Admirers of Dr. Conan Doyle will do well 
to pass by the collection of stories last published. 
They are the veriest pot-boilers, and wholly 
unworthy of his exceptional talent. It is dif- 
ficult to believe that they are recent work at 
all ; they rather bear the marks of a prentice 
hand, and we venture the guess that they have 
been unearthed from the magazines or story- 
papers of some years ago. They include tales 



of Australian bush-rangers, Russian nihilists, 
and South-African diamond hunters, and are 
crude, extravagant, and sensational. 

The volume of short stories by the author of 
" With Fire and Sword," translated by Mr. 
Curtin, exhibits the remarkable genius of the 
Polish novelist in a new light. Three of them 
are exquisitely pathetic little sketches ; a fourth 
" Bartek the Victor " although richly sup- 
plied with incident, is essentially a psychologi- 
cal study of the Polish peasant-soldier ;. while 
the fifth, failing sadly in the attempt to be 
humorous, is yet interesting as a reminiscence 
of the author's sojourn in our own American 
West. " Bartek the Victor " fills nearly half 
the volume, and comes near to being a master- 
piece in its kind. 

The collection of small volumes known as 
the " Distaff " series was designed, we are told, 
to illustrate the best work done by women of 
the State of New York in contributions to 
periodical literature. Mrs. Burton Harrison 
has edited a volume of " Short Stories " for 
this series, and the result is, to say the least, 
disappointing. Mrs. Harrison's own story, 
" Monsieur Alcibiade," is a gem, and belongs 
at the beginning rather than at the end of the 
volume. The four stories that precede it do not 
rise above a low level of mediocrity, although 
there are flashes of a sort of rude genius in 
" My Own Story," by Mrs. R. H. Stoddard. 
Miss Chesebro, Miss Crosby, and Mrs. Slosson 
are the other New York women represented. 

It is a long while since we have had a volume 
of stories from the author of " Marjory Daw," 
and the new collection is very welcome. Nor 
has the pen lost its cunning that so took us 
unawares at the close of " Marjory Daw," for 
" Two Bites at a Cherry " ends in quite as 
amusingly unexpected a fashion, while a mild 
surprise, at least, awaits the reader of " Goli- 
ath " and " My Cousin the Colonel." Fantastic 
imaginings, such as few but Mr. Aldrieh can 
deal with, are found in " The Chevalier de 
Resseguier " and one other story, while pathos 
overshadows the two remaining tales. We may 
suggest to Mr. Aldrieh, a propos of a passage 
in " My Cousin the Colonel," that it is the 
dyer's hand, not his arm, that Shakespeare 
informs us is subdued to what it works in. 
We may also question the use of the word 
"smelting," as applied to the liquefaction of 
the blood of St. Januarius, and possibly criti- 
cise the preciosity which has transformed a 
familiar colloquialism into the following state- 
ment : " Mrs. Wesley is a lady that does not

allow any species of vegetation to accumulate 
under her feet." These be trifles, but Mr. 
Aldrich is a verbal artist, and his responsibil- 
ities are greater than most writers have to bear. 
Some of Mr. Aldrich's phrases are irresistible, 
such as the soliloquy of the relativeless man : 
" I wonder that I was allowed any ancestors : 
why wasn't I created at once out of some stray 
scrap of protoplasm ? " Or the remark of Dr. 
Downs, who is about to cross the seas with the 
woman whom he hopelessly adores : " If I am 
not to have earthly happiness with her, I am 
at least to have some watery happiness." Mr. 
Aldrich's humorous touches are never far away, 
and they are always a delight. 

The short stories of Mr. James have often 
been chargeable with a sacrifice of interest to 
subtlety of analysis. The more recent of these 
stories, while losing nothing in subtlety, have 
distinctly gained in interest. This remark is 
particularly applicable to the three stories of 
the collection now at hand. In one of them, 
" Owen Wingrave," there is actually a myste- 
rious death, and, although we have more than 
a suspicion that the murderer was a ghost, it 
is gratifying to find in a story by Mr. James 
anything of so startling a character. " Colla- 
boration " seems to us the most highly finished 
of the three. It is an international episode, but 
this time Franco- German, instead of Anglo- 
American, and art for art's sake is its theme. 
That principle has fallen into much discredit 
of late, mainly through the extravagances of its 
later devotees, but we cannot afford to let it go 
altogether, and Mr. James reminds us in his 
suggestive indirect way, that it is still worthy 
of at least a limited acceptance. " The Wheel 
of Time" is a less striking story than either 
of the other two, being in the familiar manner 
of a long series of its predecessors, a manner 
to which the author is by this time so accus- 
tomed that production must result from some 
sort of reflex action rather than from any very 
energetic exercise of imaginative volition. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



A NEW life of Dickens has been undertaken by Mr. 
Thomas Wright. The information brought to me," 
Mr. Wright boldly says, " in the form of reminiscences 
and published notes, etc., will make a volume that will 
put Forster's life a long, long way in the background. 
I shall be able to throw light on the early life of Dickens 
just before he began to be famous. Some curious recol- 
lections concerning Dickens' method of work will be 
embodied in the life, and a chapter will be devoted to 
the novelist's humor, as contrasted with the humor of 
our other great laughter-compellers." 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

i. 



Holiday purchasers whose Christmas gifts take 
the suitable and sensible form of beautiful books 
need this year find little difficulty in making a se- 
lection, save, indeed, that arising from an embar- 
rassment of riches. Despite the present commercial 
depression (commercial hesitancy is perhaps the 
better word) the Holiday output is larger than 
usual, and the average of merit is higher a fact 
implying a spirit of enterprise and of public faith 
on the part of the publishers that should not go un- 
rewarded. "It's an ill wind that blows no man 
good "; and we venture to predict (with an optimism 
perhaps rather one-sided) that the "hard times" 
will inure during the Holiday season, in a way, to- 
the benefit of the bookseller. The making of Christ- 
mas presents is nowadays really more a matter of 
obligation than of choice. Not fewer gifts, but less 
expensive ones, will be in order ; and the bookstore 
is obviously the best place to lay out a moderate 
sum to advantage. The following list includes 
mainly the publications received earliest by THE 
DIAL, some important titles being reserved for no- 
tice in our issue of December 16. 

First on our list comes Messrs. Harper and 
Brothers' sumptuous art-work, "Masters and Mas- 
terpieces of Engraving," by Mr. Willis O. Chapin r 
a work of permanent interest and value, but so 
obviously suited to the wants of the more critical 
class of Holiday buyers that we include it in the 
present category. Mr. Chapin has furnished an 
intelligent, logically-coherent survey of the main 
phases of the engraver's art and of its evolution 
a happy mingling of history, biography, technical 
exposition, and criticism and appreciation of lead- 
ing men and works. The subject is popularly, yet 
soberly and critically, handled. The author has 
aimed to trace for the general reader the history of 
the art from its beginnings down to our own time, 
including in his narrative some account of the en- 
gravers themselves and of their severaLtheories and 
methods. Having discussed in the opening chapter 
the origin of the art, he proceeds to trace, in suc- 
cessive chapters, its development, in Italy, Germany, 
Holland and Flanders, France and England. The 
revival of wood-engraving, started by Bewick in 
the eighteenth century, is treated in a separate 
chapter ; and the volume closes with an account of 
"Various Modern Engravers," including those of 
the United States. The work is richly illustrated 
with sixty engravings and heliogravures some of 
them notable specimens of their class. Raimondi's 
"Lucretia" (after Raphael), Diirer's "The Nativ- 
ity," Van Leyden's " David before Saul," Van 
Dyck's "Lucas Vosterman," are superb plates; 
but where merit is so even, it is needless to partic- 
ularize. 

For the connoisseur fastidious in the arts and 
refinements of book-manufacture, there is probably 
nothing on our list likely to prove more attractive

than the captivating edition of Beckford's "Vathek," 
one hundred and fifty copies of which are issued for 
America by Messrs. Macmillan and Co. The vol- 
ume is a dainty nine-inch octavo, bound in green 
silk, with an arabesque cover design stamped in 
gold. The text is clearly printed upon the lightest 
and flakiest of hand-made laid paper; and there 
are eight full-page etchings by Mr. Herbert Nye, 
which display a facile fancy and good technical 
skill. That the plates do not include a portrait of 
the author may perhaps be thought a regrettable 
omission, the more so as the editor, Dr. Richard 
Garnett, has supplied a rather full notice of Beckf ord. 
'Vathek," facile princeps among Oriental tales by 
English writers, furnishes a fair literary analogue 
to the famous forensic effort of "Single-Speech" 
Hamilton a solitary flash of genius from out the 
obscurity of a generally mediocre career. It has 
long been regarded as a striking exception to the 

maxim, 

Nil sine magno 

Vita labor e dedit mortalibus" 

But Beckford's assertion (or rather Redding's ver- 
sion of it), that he wrote the tale in one sitting of 
three days and two nights, is now disproved on the 
evidence of Beckford's own statements in his letters 
to Henley, the original translator and annotator. 
Dr. Garnett goes into these critical issues very 
thoroughly in his Introduction. As to the literary 
qualities of "Vathek" not much need be said. It 
has held its place for a century, and has made its au- 
thor famous. Byron pronounced it far superior, as an 
Eastern tale, to " Rasselas "; and Dr. Garnett thinks 
it the only modern Oriental story worthy to appear in 
the ''Arabian Nights," with "Aladdin on its right 
hand and Ali Baba on its left " which is a pretty 
high rating. Its beauties are not recondite, and 
inability to enjoy it results from a dislike to its 
genre, from personal deficiency, in short, from a 
lack of the mental qualities it presupposes in its 
readers. We have all met the unhappy being who 
"can see nothing funny in Pickwick," and to the 
man born deaf the Anvil Chorus remains forever a 
profound silence. A copy of this beautiful edition 
of "Vathek" should please the most critical. 

That ever-green favorite, " The Autocrat of the 
Breakfast Table," makes its appearance in a neat 
two-volume edition (Houghton), with illustrations 
by Mr. Howard Pyle as the special feature. We 
are glad to note that Mr. Pyle has not lowered his 
work and degraded his author by any concessions 
to the popular taste for the comic. His illustration 
is not overdone, and it does not savor of caricature. 
In many of the plates one distinguishes the genial 
features of the "Autocrat" himself; and several 
of the more fanciful ones, notably " The Old Vio- 
lin " and " First Love," are charmingly conceived. 
There are two capital frontispiece portraits of Dr. 
Holmes. Besides the regular edition, which is ele- 
gant enough for ordinary tastes and purses, the pub- 
lishers have provided a large-paper edition which is 
one of the choicest publications of the season. 



Admirers of Charles Reade's fine novel of " The 
Cloister and the Hearth" will welcome the chastely- 
elegant two-volume edition of it issued by Messrs. 
Harper and Brothers. The volumes are made up 
in the tasteful French style a rivulet of print in 
a broad field of margin ; moderately glazed paper, 
thin and pliant ; with a great number of delicately- 
toned vignettes (in treatment nicely poised between 
the illustrative and the ornamental) set in the text, 
or at the head or the foot of the page. The artist, 
Mr. William Johnson, has done his work with tact, 
skill, and historical accuracy as to costumes and ac- 
cessories. He has not swamped the dainty text with 
too-profuse decoration, and he has caught and re- 
flected the essential temper and spirit of the story. 
Technically, Mr. Johnson's drawings call for high 
praise. Some of the figures are really models in 
precision of line and delicacy of modelling; while 
the little groups are full of energy and dramatic force 
throughout. Turning over these tempting pages, 
we are pleasantly reminded of the time when we first 
read the story, in the serial form, and with the quaint, 
strong cuts of the older editions. And what a story I 

decidedly not the finical work of the artist in 
verbal filigree, who in the end tells us nothing save 
the tale of his own pretty dexterities, but a romance, 
rich and full-bodied, strong in plot and swift in ac- 
tion, a drama of human life and human nature 
broad and undiluted, as the writers of a less critical 
and more inventive age loved to tell it. We are 
glad to see our old favorite in so fine a garb. 

In their attractive reprint of Elizur Wright's trans- 
lations of "The Fables of La Fontaine," Messrs. 
Estes and Lauriat have made a happy choice of sub- 
ject for a Holiday book. Wright's is still, all in all, 
the best English version of the chief of modern fab- 
ulists, and it is the only complete one except Thorn- 
bury's, which is to be had only, we believe, in an un- 
wieldy quarto with Dora's dubious plates. Wright's 
work originally appeared in Boston in 1841, went 
through six editions in three years, and then passed 
out of print. George Ticknor praised it, and Long- 
fellow, Prescott, Chancellor Kent, Bryant, and others, 
assisted and encouraged the translator in getting it 
published. The sixth edition was slightly expurg- 
ated, and the expurgator's self-exculpatory protest 
in his preface is worth quoting: "In this age," he 
says, "distinguished for almost everything more 
than sincerity, there are some people who would 
seem too delicate and refined to read their Bibles " 

to which reflection we take the liberty of adding 
the fabulist's couplet, 

" A filthy taint they soonest find 
Who are to relish filth inclined." 

The present edition contains thirteen well-executed 
etchings by Le Rat, from the designs of E. Adam. 
The bindings are extremely chaste and pretty. 

Another pretty book in Messrs. Estes and Lau- 
riat's creditable list is Mrs. Clara Erskine Clement's 
" The Queen of the Adriatic," handsomely printed 
at the University Press, and illustrated with views

[Dec. 1, 



of Venice in photogravure, in the style of the same 
firm's "The Lily of the Arno " of last year. The 
exceedingly tasteful cover white cloth stamped in 
blue and gold, with the lion of St. Mark and fine 
tracery calls for special notice. Mrs. Erskine's 
story of mediaeval and modern Venice is spirited 
and graphic, and the book may be commended as 
a fair complemental volume to Mr. Horatio M. 
Brown's philosophical study of the Republic, no- 
ticed in our issue of June 16. 

A beautiful and seasonable book is "The Christ- 
Child in Art" (Harper), a collection of the series 
of richly illustrated Christmas articles on the child- 
hood of Christ and its several phases as reflected in 
mediaeval and modern art, contributed by Mr. Henry 
D. Van Dyke to "Harper's Magazine." The au- 
thor, by-the-bye, should not be confounded with 
that competent art-critic John C. Van Dyke, with 
whose spirit and methods he has little in common. 
Regarding his theme mainly from the literary and 
emotional standpoint, he sheds over it a flood of 
pious enthusiasm which is always sincere and some- 
times eloquent but is not art-criticism. We do 
not mean that Mr. Van Dyke is without feeling 
for the special qualities which artists and artist- 
critics insist on as the prime qualities ; but he be- 
longs to the class of art-writers who occasionally 
read into a picture high-sailing notions which the 
painter himself (honest man!) nine times in ten 
never dreamed of putting there and appraise it 
accordingly. As a narrative, the work is interest- 
ing and valuable, and its many beautiful plates 
after mediaeval and modern masters make it an ac- 
ceptable gift-book. 

Mr. F. Hunter Potter's translation of M. Dau- 
det's "Letters from My Mill" (Dodd, Mead, and 
Co. ) is generally satisfactory rather unusually so, 
we think and the publishers have given it the 
handsome setting it deserves. We need not dwell 
here upon the charm of these crisp and delicate 
sketches. The " Lettres " are gems of French lit- 
erary art, and in them, to our thinking, M. Daudet 
has touched his high-water mark. We are glad to 
see them made accessible in a respectable English 
version. The colored full-page plates by Mme. 
Madeleine Lemaire have a fine decorative effect, 
and Mr. George Wharton Edwards's headpieces are 
acceptable. The etched portrait of M. Daudet is 
an admirable plate. 

" The Century Gallery " (Century Co.), a gener- 
ously-filled portfolio containing sixty-four selected 
proofs from "The Century Magazine," is a pro- 
duction of the pronounced Holiday order and will 
doubtless make its way. Twenty engravers are 
represented. The engravings, each of which is 
printed on heavy plate paper 13x17 inches, offer 
great variety of subject and are of very uneven 
merit. Some of them, as Mr. T. Cole's " Madonna 
and Child," after Boticelli, are clear and strong in 
line and modelling ; others, as Mr. Robert Blum's 
"A Love Story," are somewhat indistinct. The 



ensemble, however, is attractive enough, and most 
of the names represented are a guaranty for the 
original quality of the work. 

That "The Man from Blankley's " (Longmans) 
is reprinted from the London "Punch" need not 
deter the wavering American buyer, as the humor 
of the book is not of the unleavened or Passover 
brand one looks for in that respectable " Weekly." 
The volume contains a series of dialogue sketches 
by that delightful and ingenious humorist, Mr. F. 
Anstey. Mr. Anstey takes the reader the round 
of various London shops and places of amusement, 
singles out little groups of shoppers or sight-seers, 
and sets them to talking with the most delightful 
results. His reproductions of the dialect of Cock- 
aigne are almost as good as Dickens's. Not less 
capital than the text are Mr. Bernard Partridge's 
drawings. 

Col. T. A. Dodge's fine volume on the " Riders 
of Many Lands" (Harper) is already too fa- 
miliar to our readers generally to need extended 
comment. It embraces a series of descriptive and 
historical chapters on equestrianism in America, 
and on Arabian, Egyptian, Turkish, and other Ori- 
ental riders. The text is embellished and illustra- 
ted by the spirited drawings of Mr. Frederic Rem- 
ington, and by photographic plates of Oriental sub- 
jects. We are glad to note that Mr. Remington's 
work is tolerably free from what may be called 
Muybridge effects for which we own to a decided 
dislike. Colonel Dodge is master of his theme, and 
his book contains many practical suggestions for 
amateurs ambitious to " witch the world with noble 
horsemanship." 

Messrs. Estes and Lauriat are to be congratulated 
on their fine edition de Luxe (limited to five hundred 
copies) of ' Ruy Bias." The work is illustrated 
with etchings by Champollion, after the very spir- 
ited and graceful compositions of Adrien Moreau. 
Notably good are the little headpieces representing 
scenes and incidents in the drama. The book is, 
in general make-up, one of the finest on our list, 
and he will be a very captious person indeed who 
will not rejoice to find it among his Christmas gifts. 

"Chinese Nights Entertainments" (Putnam), a 
collection of forty brief tales translated by Miss 
Adele M. Fielde from the Swatow vernacular, afford 
some amazing examples of Oriental skill with the 
long bow. The stories are strung, in Eastern fash- 
ion, on the thread of a longer romance ; and they 
were gathered by the translator when " travelling 
in a slow native boat, or sitting in a dim native hut, 
with almond-eyed women and children, in the east- 
ern corner of the Kwangtung province, in Southern 
China." Their quaint fancies and native flavor 
give them a decided relish. There are some draw- 
ings by native artists ; and these are surprisingly 
free from the usual tea-tray effects and general 
topsy-turveyness of the school. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead and Co. issue " The Rivals " 
in a style generally similar to their " School for 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



347 



Scandal " of last year. Mr. Frank M. Gregory 
again supplies the illustrations five colored full- 
page aquarelles, and thirty-eight black-and-white 
text drawings, in several of which he is fairly suc- 
cessful. Mr. Gregory's work shows improvement, 
but there is a lack of verve in the conception and 
of finish in the drawing. 

Mrs. Laura E. Richards's volume of "Glimpses 
of the French Court" (Estes and Lauriat) com- 
prises a series of sketches from French history 
'The Story of Jean Baptiste," "Turenne," "A 
Corsair of France" (Jean Bart), etc. The author 
writes in a brisk, chirping, fairy-tale sort of style, 
that is at times oddly at variance with the gravity 
of her topic. But the book is wholesome and spir- 
ited, and it should prove a welcome and useful gift 
to younger readers. There are a number of por- 
traits, one or two of them exceedingly well done. 

In our December issue of 1890 we praised a 
sumptuous edition of Mr. Austin Dobson's " Me- 
moir of Horace Walpole," with etchings by Percy 
Moran. The publishers, Messrs. Dodd, Mead, and 
Co., now issue, in a new style, a more practical and 
less expensive edition of the work, in make-up sim- 
ilar to their pretty " Eighteenth Century Vignettes " 
of last year. There are fourteen well-made and 
well-chosen process-work portraits of celebrities, 
mainly of Walpolian times. Among these we note 
" David Hume," a placid, strong face, " Lady 
Montague," "Mrs. Clive," "Mine, du Deffand" 
("old blind debauchee of wit," as caustic Horace 
styled her), "Thomas Gray," "Lady Walpole," 
"Hannah More" the dainty Quakeress of whose 
charms the great Johnson was once slyly mindful 
as Boswell tells us ; and, lastly, the volatile virtuoso 
of Strawberry Hill himself, whose likeness rather 
bears out Macaulay's conception of his character. 
There is an appended list of books printed at the 
Strawberry Hill Press. We have already praised 
Mr. Dobson's sprightly anecdotal " Memoir," which 
was originally issued, we believe, by its present pub- 
lishers. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons' elaborate "Van 
Twiller" edition of Irving's " Knickerbocker's His- 
tory of New York " follows in most points its pro- 
totypes, the " Darro " edition of " The Alhambra " 
(1891), and the "Agapida" edition of "The Con- 
quest of Granada " (1892). In the present work 
the decorative page-border is of a paler tone, and, in 
the plates, for the sun's pencil is substituted that of 
Mr. E. W. Kemble. Mr. Kemble's designs are irre- 
sistibly funny not over-refined or over-artistic, cer- 
tainly, but bubbling over with humor. He has drawn 
Irving's many-breeched, cabbage-loving (and cab- 
bage-headed) Dutchmen to the life though without 
much regard for the ancestral pride of their des- 
cendants numbered among Mr. MacAllister's 400 
Brahmans. The " Van Twiller" edition is finely 
printed and richly bound, and it should repeat the 
success of its predecessors. 

"A Norse Romance" (Putnam) is a thin quarto 



of the familiar Holiday type, containing a brief 
poem, with crayon di'awings, by Mrs. 0. M. Spof- 
ford. The quality of Mrs. Spofford's verse may be 
indicated in the following selection : 

" Like winged beasts the waters rise, 

Or sink with sullen roar ; 
From deep green depths the lurid eyes 
Of monsters seem to tower." 

Mrs. Spofford's drawings are rather better than her 
verses. 

Considering the modest price asked for it, Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell and Co.'s two-volume edition of Car- 
lyle's " History of the French Revolution " is a very 
satisfactory one. The print is new and bright, the 
paper fairly good, and the volumes (respectively 
361 and 435 pp.) are desirably compact. Carlyle's 
"History" is still unapproached for the dramatic 
splendor of its narrative, the vigor of its portrait- 
ure, and the vivid impression it leaves upon the 
mind of the reader. There are few books of which 
one retains more that is worth retaining, without 
special effort. The portraits, where they are well 
verified, add much to the pictorial force of the nar- 
rative. 

A striking and unique book externally is "The 
Old Garden, and Other Verses" (Houghton), by 
Margaret Deland. The text is printed in black- 
letter, and each page is showily decorated in mis- 
sal style and colors by Mr. Walter Crane. As a 
novelty the book is very well, but Mrs. Deland's 
graceful verses do not seem to call for a setting 
quite so " unprofitably gay." Viewed away from 
the ensemble, Mr. Crane's designs are attractive 
enough. 

Readers for whom seventy pages of unbroken 
Negro dialect have no terrors will look with favor 
upon the tasty volume containing Mr. Thomas Nel- 
son Page's familiar story " Meh Lady " (Scribner), 
with Mr. C. S. Reinhart's familiar plates. The book 
is nicely and modestly bound, and will doubtless 
find friends. 

A tasteful booklet is Longfellow's " The Hang- 
ing of the Crane, and Other Poems of the Home " 
(Houghton). Paper, binding, and typography con- 
sidered, the little volume is an almost flawless piece 
of book-making, while the eight process cuts serve 
their modest purpose. The poems, ten in number, 
are selected on the principle indicated in the title, 
and the cii'cumstances under which Mr. Longfellow 
wrote them are given in the appended notes. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and Co.'s new edition 
of Miss S. 0. Jewett's " Deephaven," with its all 
too-shiny paper and its (to our thinking) rather 
crudely-conceived cover, is scarcely recognizable as 
"a Houghton" publication. The best part of the 
book barring, of course, the story, which is charm- 
ing is the illustration by Charles and Maria Wood- 
bury. Some of Miss Woodbury's Yankee types, 
notably " Mrs. Dockum," " Skipper Scudder," and 
the bucolic group surrounding a circus elephant, are 
capitally drawn. 

The continuedjlpopularity [of Mr. Blackmore's 



348 



[Dec. 1, 



strong novel, " Lorna Doone," is evinced by the 
several new editions of it issued this Autumn. 
Among them is one, from Messrs. T. Y. Crowell and 
Co., in two volumes, with illustrative drawings by 
Mr. F. T. Merrill, that, its very moderate price 
considered, will be hard to match. 

Messrs. Estes and Lauriat have made William 
Ware's " Aurelian, Emperor of Rome " a tale of 
the Empire in the third century the basis of a 
rather attractive gift-book. It is well printed at 
the University Press, and contains twenty full-page 
plates, mostly photographic, of Roman views, art- 
works, portraits, etc. The cover, white and red 
with gilt tracery and stamped medallion, is very 
ornate. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead, and Co. have made a pretty 
book of Mrs. Amelia E. Barr's old New York 
romance, " The Bow of Orange Ribbon." The 
text is well printed on highly-glazed paper, and 
the large colored plates and fancifully disposed 
vignettes have a pleasing effect. The artist is Mr. 
Theodore Hampe. 



BOOKS FOR THE YOTJNG. 

I. 



The best of the books for the young are those which 
tell a dramatic historical tale vividly, describe pictur- 
esquely and truthfully the life of foreign countries or 
the heroes of our own, or appeal to the imagination 
through fairies, folk-lore, or heroic deeds. There are 
some of these among the publications of this season, but 
they are not numerous. Most of them follow the gen- 
eral run of stories for boys. We find such familiar 
names among the writers as those of Messrs. G. A. Henty, 
William O. Stoddard, Kirk Munroe, and Oliver Optic, 
all of whom write vigorous, healthful stories of advent- 
ure, very good of their kind. Mr. Hezekiah Butter- 
worth and Col. Thomas W. Kuox send their customary 
books of travel, and Mr. Andrew Lang, Mrs. Burnett, 
Mrs. Champney, and Ouida have each something to offer 
us. The notable novelties are few. The Century Com- 
pany's " World's Fair Book," with its excellent illustra- 
tions from photographs and from Castaigne's beautiful 
drawings, will be deservedly popular ; and Mr. Henry 
M. Stanley's tales of his " Dark Companions " (Scrib- 
ner) will doubtless have a wide circulation. Mrs. Seelye 
follows up her last year's " Story of Columbus " with a 
"Story of Washington" (Appleton), which, in spite of 
our ill-directed familiarity with that stately figure, is 
badly needed. The discoverers are considered in Mr. 
F. Gordon Stables's "Westward with Columbus " (Scrib- 
ner) and Mrs. Bolton's " Famous Voyagers and Explor- 
ers " (Crowell) ; and there are one or two books of nat- 
ural history. Of the story books, besides those already 
mentioned, Mrs. Richards publishes one for girls and 
Mrs. Champney another for boys. Blanche Willis How- 
ard has also joined the ranks; but Mrs. Burnett's auto- 
biographical study, " The One I Knew the Best of All " 
(Scribner), takes the place of her usual volume of tales. 
Mr. Andrew Lang's True Story Book " (Longmans), 
from which much was expected, is rather disappointing. 
Artistically, this season's crop is rather below the 
average of former years. But one ingenious volume, 
"Topsys and Turvys" (Century Co.), will certainly 



make a sensation among the little people. The draw- 
ings, of which the book is made up, are the work of 
Mr. P. S. Newell ; and so cleverly are they designed, 
that one may turn the picture upside down and find, 
from that point of view, that its lines make a totally 
different picture, furnishing the sequel to the story told 
by the first. This kind of puzzle is attractive to chil- 
dren, and to the child in each of us, and the artist is so 
ingenious and has so large a fund of humor at his dis- 
posal that the book is very diverting. He has, too, a 
sense of color, so that his pictures are generally decor- 
ative Mr. Palmer Cox issues the third of his popular 
Brownie books, this time " The Brownies at Home " 
(Century Co.). It seems to belie its name, however, 
or to prove the cosmopolitanism of these midgets, for 
the author describes their wanderings through the South, 
Washington, New York, and the World's Fair. The 
latter episode is badly treated, however, and the draw- 
ings illustrating it are not only inaccurate, but inartistic, 
which is much worse. The Brownies themselves, though, 
are amusing, and their comical expressions and costumes 
will serve to entertain many idle half hours. In " The 
Musical Journey of Dorothy and Delia" (Crowell), also, 
the drawings are more important than the text, although 
the story is bright and original. It is written by Mr. 
Bradley Gilman to enliven the tasks of plodding little 
musicians, and it may easily serve to give an imagina- 
tive lift in the mind of the student to the dry ranks of 
notes in the music-book. The frolics of the naughty 
notes described here would give them a new character 
to a child, endow them with life and animation enough 
to make them interesting. The drawings by Mr. F. E. 
Attwood, which illustrate the book, are thoroughly 
charming and give a fascinating individuality to the 

wayward notes and puzzling musical terms With these 

may also be mentioned, because of its cleverly-drawn 
illustrations, " The History of a Bearskin" (Dodd, Mead, 
and Co.). It is from the French of M. Jules de Mar- 
thold, but its illustrations, by J. O. B., are not trans- 
lated; they are French to the core, gay, dashing, orig- 
inal, and delightfully humorous. There are quantities 
of them scattered through the text, and not one is with- 
out character. The story itself is a fit accompaniment 
to these drawings. A French peasant, who by luck, 
rather than merit or ambition, became a grenadier dur- 
ing the Napoleonic wars, is the hero, and his naive self- 
assurance, together with a kind of bravado in his cow- 
ardice, are very entertaining. The story sparkles with 
wit, and its presentation of peasant types is extremely 
clever, though rather too sophisticated, perhaps, for 
young readers. 

One of the most notable books of the season contin- 
ues the series of fairy tales which have been published 
from year to year by Mr. Joseph Jacobs, the editor of 
"Folk-Lore." The present book is called "More En- 
glish Fairy Tales " (Putnam) , being the second collection 
which this indefatigable scholar has gathered from En- 
glish sources. They are excellent stories, admirably 
told. They all seem to come direct from the people, 
so straightforward are they in thought, so clear and dra- 
matic in plot and construction, and so simple and forci- 
ble in style. The editor's work has been done extremely 
well, and the result is a collection of tales fascinating 
to children of all ages. Several old favorites are among 
them: the Pied Piper in an English setting, the Three 
Bears, the Children in the Wood, and others; but most 
of the tales are new to our ears, and all of them have 
the delicious fragrance of the soil. Mr. Jacobs's work 



1893.]

in collecting these tales is invaluable and deserves our 
special gratitude. The book is illustrated by Mr. John 
D. Batten, whose drawings are original and very artistic; 
he has the true decorative touch, and this, with his hu- 
mor, makes his designs an education to children and a 
rare pleasure to their elders. Of very different calibre 
is the other volume of fairy-tales in this year's collec- 
tion. "The Chronicles of Fairyland" (Lippincott), by 
Mr. Fergus Hume, are such fantastic tales as the most 
limited imagination could evolve. They are goody- 
goody stories, too, in which the moral strikes one in the 
face; but the ideal of honor which they create is not al- 
ways of the highest. When one is shown the misery to 
be produced by sin and the happiness gained in renounc- 
ing it, it is easy enoiigh to choose the right course, like 
the little crossing-sweeper in one of these stories ; but 
the lesson to be gained from this, that material rewards 
always accompany virtvie, is of questionable beneficence. 

" Melody, the Story of a Child " (Estes) will doubt- 
less be very successful, if for no other reason than be- 
cause it is written by Mrs. Laura E. Richards, the au- 
thor of " Captain January." It is a sweet and simple 
story of a blind girl, who is gifted with a remarkable 
voice. The adopted child of two maiden ladies in a 
little New England village, she is stolen from them by 
an ambitious musician ; and the tale of her unhappiness, 
ending finally in a joyous return to her home, is prettily 
told. The subordinate characters are well handled and 
have much individuality; and in the little heroine, Mrs. 
Richards has really created a starry soul. A very dif- 
ferent kind of hero is represented in the little book for 
boys which Miss Blanche Willis Howard has just pub- 
lished ; a much more practical, every-day type, but one 
thoroughly boyish and genuine and fine. The title of 
the book, " No Heroes " (Hough ton), is given in allu- 
sion to Bob's lament that he was not born in the olden 
time, when there were knights and ladies, and a man 
could be a hero. The story of his own unconsciously 
heroic sacrifice, which follows, is told in a straightfor- 
ward, vigorous way which will appeal to boys and girls. 
It has the touch of strong feeling in it, without losing in 
the least its masculinity. 

Louisa de la Rame" (Ouida) is less successful in her 
work for children this year than last, when she published 
some charming fancies. " A Dog of Flanders, and 
Other Stories " (Lippincott) contains four tales which 
are rather old and rather melancholy for the cheery 
temperaments of children. Each one of them has a 
tragic end, and enough of the bitterness of life to give 
a distinctly morbid tone. This is hardly mitigated by 
the fine and noble characters, for they are so invariably 
unhappy that the effect of the tales is doleful. " A 
Leaf in the Storm " is the most inspiring of them, with 
its fearful picture of the brutality and the heroism 
voked by the Franco-Prussian war. But the last one 
should never have been included in a book for children, 
so sophisticated is it in plot and emotion. A vigorous, 
healthful story comes this year from Mrs. Elizabeth W. 
Champney. It is called "Six Boys" (Estes), though 
one of the set is a girl, and describes their adventures 
through the complications resulting from an attempt at 
robbery. Suspicion is thrown upon the one who is 
afterwards shown to be the bravest and manliest of 
them all; and though the misunderstandings are finally 
straightened out, they are exciting enough in the telling. 
The style is brisk and vivacious, and there is neither 
coarseness nor sentimentality in the natural boy-life 
presented. The conception of " The True Story Book " 



(Longmans), by Mr. Andrew Lang, was an admirable 
one, for no more fascinating stories of adventure could 
possibly be devised than some which have been enacted 
in this work-a-day world. This volume takes the place 
of Mr. Lang's annual fairy book, and relates strange 
episodes from the lives of Prince Charlie, Grace Dar- 
ling, Benvenuto (Bellini, Cervantes, Baron Trenck, CaBsar 
Borgia, Corte's, and many another scapegrace and hero. 
The stories are fine, but the book is something of a dis- 
appointment, because they are not simple enough in 
style, nor direct and forcible enough in arrangement. 
They are not well focused, in short, a defect which 
might have been obviated by the suppression of some 
details and the accenting of certain others. They remind 
one of Mr. Oscar Wilde's lament that life is not artistic. 
Nevertheless, to boys of about fifteen these tales will 
give stirring matter for reflection In " The One I 
Knew the Best of All " (Scribner),'Mrs. Frances Hodg- 
son Burnett has related in the most delicate and charm- 
ing way her memories of her own childish impressions. 
It is really a valuable record of the development of a 
child's mind which she has produced, and the pictures 
of her successive mental struggles in adjusting herself 
to the forms and conventionalities of the world are vivid 
and enlightening. The book, however, is rather for the 
mothers of boys and girls than for the children them- 
selves, for it is a study of mental processes and impres- 
sions which may increase their understanding of childish 
fancies and broaden their sympathy with them. 

That the boys and girls of to-day should lack histor- 
ical knowledge seems very far from the desire of those 
who write for the young, if one may judge from the 
outpouring of books having their foundation in fact. It 
is perhaps a fortunate thing that the books having such 
a foundation are usually superior in literary merit to 
those that are purely fiction. One of the most deserv- 
edly popular of these writers of historical fiction is Mr. 
G. A. Henty, who this year sends three new volumes 
to delight his youthful admirers. One of these, "St. 
Bartholomew's Eve " (Scribner), is an exciting tale of 
the adventures of a young English lad who goes to 
France and engages with his relatives in the Huguenot 
wars. His mother is a French-Huguenot fugitive to 
England, and it is for her sake that he casts his. lot 
with the persecuted French Protestants. His experi- 
ences bring him into relations of intimacy with the 
frank and kindly young King of Niavarre, and the 
book closes with the terrible scene which gives it its 
name. There is a good spicing of romance with it all, 
for the young hero saves the life of a fair young French- 
woman, and in the end we hear the echo of the wed- 
ding-bells. " Through the Sikh War " (Scribner), from 
the same pen, deals with the problems that confronted 
the English in the conquest of India. It has about it 
the fascinating atmosphere of that land of fable, of 
Oriental magnificence, of turbaued rajahs and dusky 
servants. It gives a very spirited account not only of 
the daring exploits of its boy-hero, Percy Groves, but of 
the intrigue and assassination, the play and counter-play, 
which characterize the strategic warfare of India. 
In "A Jacobite Exile" (Scribner), Mr. Henty has 
built upon the foundation offered by the life of an 
English boy in the service of Charles XII. of Sweden. 
With his father and friends he is unjustly exiled for 
his fondness for the Stuarts, and in the course of the 
years thus spent has many thrilling adventures. His 
meetings with Peter the Great, while unconscious of 
the latter's identity, are very entertaining, and give a 



350 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



graphic picture of that monumental character. If one 
were disposed to criticise Mr. Henty's work, it might 
be said that his heroes bear a decided, family resem- 
blance, in other words, they are not very sharply 
individualized ; but the type of boyhood he chooses is 
such a manly one that there is little room for complaint. 
The style is clear and forceful, and the atmosphere 
pure and bracing. The illustrations of these three vol- 
umes are usually good. 

" The Boys of Greenway Court " (Apple ton), from 
the pen of Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth, is a rambling 
story with an Indian Summer atmosphere about it. The 
characters of Washington and the young friends who 
were wont to gather with him at Greenway Court, the 
home of Lord Fairfax, are sketched with few lines. A 
very pleasant picture is this of the old Virginian lord, 
stern but kindly, living in the midst of his vast estates, 
and, while devoutly loyal to the king, unconsciously 
moulding the characters of these young men who in 
after years set that same king at defiance. The hero 
is a lad by the name of Harry Meudell, whose faithful- 
ness to the injunction " Be true to the best that is in 
you " proves a source of sufficient trouble to make a 
thread of romance about which to weave the truth. Mr. 
Butterworth chooses to make but few moral points, but 
they are so well made that they are likely to stick in 
the memory. The chief drawback to a thorough enjoy- 
ment of his work, however, is the very jerky character 
of the style. 

The American Revolution seems to offer unlimited 
possibilities for thrilling stories ; and it is this field 
which Mr. W. O. Stoddard enters twice this year. 
" Guert Ten Eyck " (Lothrop) is a stirring narrative of 
pre-Revolutionary times in New York, the story ending 
with the execution of Nathan Hale. The hero, Guert 
Ten Eyck, is a thoroughly enterprising and wide-awake 
Yankee boy, in spite of his Dutch ancestry. He enters, 
heart and soul, into the feelings of his elders, and very 
materially assists the cause of freedom by his work as 
messenger and scout. Two very picturesque characters 
are introduced: an old slave, and a Manhattan Indian 
who is the last of his race, and who assists in the attempt 
to expel the English because in the simplicity of his 
heart he believes the island will be his when they are 
gone. Young Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton 
figure prominently. The writer catches the true spirit of 
those exciting times, and never allows the interest to flag. 
It is a sadder though no less truthful side of the same 
struggle which is given by the same writer in " On the 
Old Frontier " (Appleton). This work depicts the last 
raid of the Iroquois upon a little fort in Western New 
York. The type of character that held its own against 
these Indian raids, and pushed forward, fighting at 
every step, to lay the foundations of a great state, is 
finely drawn. The book is one which will give some of 
our boys a new idea of what privation means, and teach 
them to honor the memory of those pioneers whose stead- 
fast courage made their present comfort possible. The 
illustrations of Mr. Stoddard's books leave much to be 
desired. 

It is with a different period of history, and one not 
so often treated in books for boys, that Mr. Kirk Munroe 
deals in "The White Conquerors" (Scribner). This 
story is free from sensationalism, and gives a straight- 
forward but exciting account of the conquest of the 
wonderful Aztec Empire by Cortez and his handful of 
Spanish followers. The central figure is not the white 
leader, but a young Toltec, Huetzin by name, who be- 



longs to the earlier race driven out by the Aztecs. His 
hatred of that race and of their religion is as great as 
that of the white men. The symbol of the Toltec reli- 
gion is, curiously enough, the cross, and this forms a 
bond of union between them and the foreigners. There 
are picturesque descriptions of scenery and of life among 
the natives, and accounts of battles and stratagems full 
of fire and dash. 

" The Story of Washington " (Appleton), written by 
Mrs. Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye and edited by Dr. 
Edward Eggleston, is a book that should be welcomed 
with delight by all who have the best interests of young 
Americans at heart. As in " The Story of Columbus," 
which appeared last year, the author has striven to 
strip away the glamour of romance thrown around the 
hero by a doting generation, and let him stand before 
the world as a man and not as the godlike being of tra- 
dition. He loses not a whit by the operation ; in fact, 
he is the gainer. Mrs. Seelye has striven to give all 
the more interesting facts of the period of which Wash- 
ington is the central figure, and to give them in an 
entertaining style that, is not lacking in energy and 
spirit when occasion offers. The volume is prettily 
bound, and is profusely illustrated by Miss Allegra 
Eggleston, whose drawings from old pictures, with 
charming sketches of scenery, add much to its beauty. 

Mr. Edward S. Ellis offers this year " The River and 
Wilderness Series " (Price-McGill Co.), three volumes 
entitled, respectively, " The River Fugitives," " The 
Wilderness Fugitives," and " Lena-Wiugo, the Mo- 
hawk." The volumes form a narrative of the advent- 
ures of three young people in escaping from the English 
and Indians, after the Wyoming Massacre. Mr. Ellis 
certainly shows ingenuity in his plot, and cleverness in 
carrying it out ; yet we cannot but feel that the basis 
of the narrative (the attempt of the brutal commander 
of the English forces, Colonel Butler, to capture the 
pretty sister of one of the boys, and their efforts to 
compass her escape) is hardly a suitable subject for a 
young mind to dwell upon. Mr. Ellis also completes 
his " Wild Wood Series " (Porter and Coates) with a 
volume entitled " Across Texas," a spirited account 
of the dangers and excitements incident to a journey 
on horseback across Texas and New Mexico. 

" Oliver Optic " adds to his " Blue and Gray Series " 
(Lee and Shepard) a volume entitled " A Victorious 
Union." The works of this veteran writer are so dear 
to the heart of every American boy that they need no 
introduction. The present one is endowed with the 
same spirit and enthusiasm that characterized its pred- 
ecessors, and is certain of its welcome, as is the new 
volume in his " All Over the World Series," entitled 
" American Boys Afloat," issued by the same publishers. 
That constant favorite with boys, Colonel T. W. Knox, 
makes his customary annual contribution to his " Boy 
Travellers " series (Harper), this time taking his young 
excursionists through Southern Europe. As in the pre- 
vious volumes, the descriptions are given with painstak- 
ing care, and the narrative is full of historical allusions. 
The illustrations are both very numerous and very good. 

A little late to be in the flood-tide of popularity comes 
another story of Columbus and the discovery of Amer- 
ica, " Diccon the Bold " (Putnam), by Mr. John Russell 
Coryell. Yet, though late, it will be found entertaining. 
The hero is a blundering, heedless lad, whose warm 
heart and sturdy frankness prove the means of getting 
him into many difficulties, but also are the means of 
gaining him many warm friends, among whom is the

great explorer. Besides accompanying Columbus on 
his first and most famous voyage, Diccon joins the 
Cabots in many of their expeditions, which are enter- 
tainingly described. 

As the Columbian Exposition furnished the great 
attraction of the year to travellers and sight-seers, it 
has naturally furnished also the material for what is 
likely to prove the most attractive juvenile book of the 
season. " The Century World's Fair Book for Boys and 
Girls," prepared by Mr. Tudor Jenks and published by 
the Century Co., is a clever idea cleverly executed. 
The two lively boys who visit the Fair with their tutor 
seem to permit very little to escape their vision. They 
hunt out all the more interesting exhibits, visit the mar- 
vels of the Plaisance, laugh over the remarks of unso- 
phisticated fellow-visitors, make pencil sketches and 
take " snap-shots " of things which interest them. Be- 
sides these rough sketches, there are many fine photo- 
graphic views, and some exquisitely poetic drawings by 
Mr. Castaigne, several of which have already appeared 
in " The Century." The book will be a delight to the 
children who had the good fortune to see the glories of 
the White City ; while to those who had not, it will be 
a never-ending source of pleasure and profit. 



NEW YORK TOPICS. 



New York, Nov. 23, 1893. 

The opening of the new Institute for the employees 
of the Clarendon Press has again drawn attention to the 
concentration of the management of this ancient organ- 
ization, in all its branches, into the hands of persons di- 
rectly responsible to Oxford University. All its affairs 
are now controlled by a board of delegates or trustees, 
by whom a managing secretary is employed to conduct 
the Press and to supervise its publications in all the 
stages of manufacture. The books, when completed, are 
put into the hands of a publisher acting as agent for 
the Press, who manages their sale. Mr. Henry Frowde, 
of London, is now agent for Great Britain, and Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co., who preceded him in that capacity, 
still retain, through their New York house, the Amer- 
ican agency. These facts are of interest in connection 
with an agitation in behalf of a proposed similar Press, 
which has been going on in this city for the last two 
years, or practically since the new movement toward a 
broader educational basis began at Columbia College. 
The teaching force of this University has increased to 
nearly two hundred and fifty members, who publish in 
the course of the year upward of a thousand books, 
pamphlets, and articles, in the various departments of 
creative and technical literature. The number of stu- 
dents and alumni who are doing effective work along 
the same lines is also rapidly growing larger. Hence 
it has seemed necessary to provide an organization for 
the publication of the best of this material under the 
supervision of officers of the University. Last summer 
the Columbia University Press was quietly incorporated 
at Albany, under the " club act," for " economic, his- 
toric, and literary purposes." The president of Colum- 
bia College is, ex-officio, president of the board of trus- 
tees of the Press, and the nine trustees are, presumably, 
gentlemen connected with the University, which has au- 
thorized the formation of the new corporation, although 
assuming no financial risks in its behalf. Besides Pres- 
ident Low, the first board of management is composed of 
Nicholas Murray Butler, dean of the faculty of philoso- 



phy, secretary ; Francis B. Crocker, professor of electrical 
engineering; George M. dimming, professor of law, 
treasurer; Brander Matthews, professor of literature; 
Richmond Mayo-Smith, professor of political economy; 
Henry F. Osborn, professor of biology ; H. Thurston Peck, 
professor of Latin; T. Mitchell Prudden, M.D.; and Mr. 
John B. Pine, a trustee of the University. It will thus be 
seen that the several faculties and the trustees have each 
a representative in the Press board. An executive com- 
mittee for the transaction of routine business will be 
composed of the officers. The board will move with 
great conservatism at first, and does not expect its plans 
to reach a full degree of development for several years. 
It will, I understand, assume financial responsibility for 
its ventures, and will invite subscriptions and bequests 
to this end. Its present aim is to associate with itself 
some reputable publishing firm who will manage its 
sales and perhaps conduct its manufacturing depart- 
ment. Important technical works, which would not pay 
expenses if published in the ordinary way, will be un- 
dertaken, and the numerous periodicals edited wholly 
or in part by the teaching staff of the University may 
be invited to issue from the Press. The Press has 
adopted for its imprint the words " Columbia " and " Uni- 
versity Press " displayed on either side, surmounted by 
a representation of the iron crown presented to Colum- 
bia (then Kings) College by George III., and, under- 
neath, the legend " in litteris libertas." Above and be- 
low the word "Columbia" are the figures 1754 and 
1893, the dates of the founding of the College and of the 
Press respectively. 

The season for lectures is now well under way. Prob- 
ably the most interesting announcement of the kind 
yet made is that Prof. Charles Eliot Norton will de- 
liver a series of lectures on Dante before the Johns 
Hopkins University this winter, which, I am told, will 
be the third course given on the Percy Turnbull poetry 
foundation. Professor Jebb's course, delivered last sea- 
son, has just been published by Messrs. Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co. as " The Growth and Influence of Classical 
Greek Poetry," and it seems likely that these yearly 
courses of lectures on poetry will be regularly printed 
by the Riverside Press, as suggested by the first lecturer 
a year or more ago. Mr. George W. Cable, whose in- 
activity in a literary way has been so much regretted 
of late years, will give readings in various cities of 
Pennsylvania during December, from a new and impub- 
lished novel, and it may be taken for granted that the 
book itself will be in the hands of his readers before 
the end of 1894. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt has just com- 
pleted a course of seven lectures at Columbia on " The 
Westward Growth of the United States during the Rev- 
olutionary War," but this formidable title does not con- 
vey any idea of the entertaining manner in which Mr. 
Roosevelt mingles history and frontier " yarns " to the 
edification of a crowded lecture-room of students. 

Mrs. S. J. Higginson's " A Princess of Java," pub- 
lished five or six years ago, was remarkable for its 
combination of a most interesting story with attractive 
pictures of native life in the equatorial island where her 
husband was United States consul for a considerable 
period. Mrs. Higginson is now living in New York, 
and has lately been occupied with the writing of a new 
novel, " A Bedouin Girl," which Messrs. J. Selwin Tait 
& Sons are about to publish. The author has made 
use of personal observation in the case of this book also, 
having made the Haj or Holy Pilgrimage. The same 
firm will publish early in December a new novel by

Mrs. Craigie (" John Oliver Hobbes ") with the title, 
" A Bundle of Life." Mrs. Craigie's previous novels 
have been the most successful of the new " Pseudonym

a resident of London. 

A widely circulated report that Mr. Samuel L. Clem- 
ens has retired from the publishing firm of Messrs. 
Charles L. Webster & Co. is authoritatively denied. 
It may be stated that this firm has disposed of its sub- 
scription business to another house, in order to enter 
more actively into trade publication. 

The announcement of Mr. Joaquin Miller's new poetic 
romance and a well-considered critique of the poet's 
writings reached me at the same time. The latter 
was the final essay of a series on " Living American 
Writers," written by Mr. Henry C. Vedder of the San 
Francisco " Examiner " for that paper. These essays 
have attracted considerable attention here for their able 
treatment and classification of the leading American 
authors of the period. They will be published in book 
form next year. In his critique of Mr. Miller, Mr. 
Vedder does not hesitate to say that the poet's early 
transatlantic success was founded on British insularity 
and ignorance of the real literary significance of his 
writings. The critic considers Mr. Miller at his best 
in his lyrics, and concludes by saying: "Certain per- 
sonal eccentricities have also stood between him and a 
just appreciation of his work. There is so much that 
is finely imaginative in his verse, so much that is 
genuine in feeling and powerful in expression, that, in 
spite of his maddening shortcomings, the perverse wil- 
f ulness of his errors, he deserves, and should before this 
have been awarded by general suffrage, an honored 
place well up on the roll of American poets."

Prof. R. T. Ely's " Taxation in American States and

Professor Ernst Curtius is to publish his miscellaneous

It is announced that a French publishing house is 
about to start, in January probably, a rival to the 
" Revue des Deux Moudes," which is supposed to have 
somewhat lost favor in France of late under the editor- 
ship of the younger Buloz. 

Messrs. Charles L. Webster & Co., of New York, 
write to us denying the rumor that they intend to 
retire from the book-publishing business. The rumor 
seems to have started from the fact that they have re- 
cently disposed of the subscription department of their

Mr. Benson, the author of " Dodo," was educated at 
Marlborough and King's College, Cambridge, where he 
gained a scholarship which enabled him to spend a large

archaeological work. For some time past he has been 
engaged in digging up Megalopolis, the ancient capital 
of Arcadia.

iciled Englishman, his improvement was quite astonish- 
ing," is the amiable comment of the " Saturday Review " 
npon Mr. Lowell, in an article upon the recently pub- 
lished " Letters." This instance of " condescension " 
would have been so keenly relished by its subject that 
it is a pity he could not have lived to witness it. 

The following anecdote of the late Professor Jowett 
appears in an English journal. A somewhat pretentious 
youth was enlarging in the master's presence on " Our 
Debt to France." To France we owe our art, the best 
of our literature, etc. " Do you know," said Jowett, 
" what is inscribed over the gate of hell ? " The youth 
quoted Dante's well-known line. " No," was the reply. 
" The inscription is, ' Id on parle Franfais.' " 

Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, of Portland, Me., announces 
for early publication " Songs of Adieu," a collection of 
recent English lyrics compiled mainly from inaccessible 
sources ; and " Old World Lyrics," a collection of 
translations from Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard, and other 
French lyrists. These little books are printed from 
type on Van Gelder handmade paper, and are modelled 
on an old-style format calculated to appeal to book- 
lovers. These books, like others previously issued by 
Mr. Mosher, will not be reprinted. 

The ceremonies attending the unveiling of a memorial 
to James Russell Lowell in the Chapter House of West- 
minster Abbey were held November 28 the memorial 
consisting of two stained-glass windows, one of them 
containing a portrait of the poet. A distinguished com- 
pany was present, comprising many of the foremost 
men in English literature and public life. Mr. Leslie 
Stephen, as Chairman of the Memorial Committee, said 
in his address that the committee had received many 
offers from the United States regarding the memorial, 
but it had been thought fit to decline them because they 
wished to show that Englishmen themselves knew how 
to honor a great American in the spirit in which Lowell 
spoke and wrote. "The reason we have met here to 
honor Lowell is suggested to any one visiting the Poets' 
Corner. The long line of illustrious men whose monu- 
ments are there and who passed the torch of literature 
from Chaucer to Tennyson would doubtless recognize 
Lowell as a congenial disciple. Scarcely~one of these 
followed letters with more unflagging zeal. On him 
fell the spirit of the great masters." 

TRIBUTES TO EDWIN BOOTH. 

The exercises in memory of Edwin Booth, arranged 
by the Players' Club, in New York City, November 13, 
included notable tributes from distinguished fellow- 
actors, among them Signor Salvini, Mr. Irving, and Mr. 
Jefferson. Signor Salvini said in part: 

" Among the sweetest pleasures of my dramatic career 
none is more sweet than this, that I have enjoyed fra- 
ternal relations with actors of a different tongue, and 
highest of all I count and boast the satisfaction of hav- 
ing been the companion, even for a brief period, of Ed- 
win Booth. In this time of happy recollection, the 
esteem which I had long cherished for him became 
established, and I had opportunity to observe that while 
genius attended him as an artist, refinement, culture, 
delicacy, and right feeling were never absent from him 
as a man. With good reason he enjoyed the love of 
his fellow-citizens, and confided in the sympathy and

respect of his comrades on the stage, to whom he was 
a miracle of good counsel, of masterly teaching, and of 
liberality; to whom he dedicated the Players' Club, as 
a conspicuous proof of his enduring affection for his art 
and for his interpreters." 

Prof. George E. Woodberry read an elegy composed 
for the occasion, from which we make a brief extract : 

" tender soul of human melancholy 
That o'er him brooded like the firmament ! 
Thence had his eyes their supernatural fires 
And his deep soul its element of night ; 
Thence had he felt the touch of great thoughts wholly 
That with mortality but ill consent, 
The star-crost spirit's unconfined desires, 
That in this brief breath plumes its fiery flight ; 
And on his brows hung ever the pale might 
Of intellectual passion, inward bent, 
Musing the bounds of Nature's continent, 
In that great shadow where the mind aspires, 
With flashes beautiful and eloquent ; 
There love, that flies abreast with thoughts of youth, 
And glides, a splendor, by the wings of truth, 
Over the luminous vague to darkness went, 
Like some slow-dying star down heaven's pole, 
It moves o'er earth's blind frame and man's dark soul 
And passes out of sight, 

And the lone soul once more inurns its light. 
So in his blood the poet's passion wrought, 
His nature from within dark influence lent, 
While with his body, there , the spirit blent, 
And stamped the changeling of creative thought 
The soul incarnate in its mortal bloom, 
The infinite, shut in how little room 
The word, the act, no more ; yet thereof made 
The player who the heart of Hamlet played ! 
Ah, who shall e'er forget the sweet, grave face, 
The beauty flowering from a stately race, 
The mind of majesty, the heart of grace ? " 



PROFESSOR JEBB'S TRIBUTE TO JOWETT. 

The following tribute to the late Master is paid him 
by Professor R. C. Jebb, in the "Cambridge Review": 

" Slowly it dawned on one how maturely and firmly 
he possessed that which J. S. Mill recognizes in the old 
classics, ' the wisdom of life ' a fruit difficult to gather 
and to store ; he was indeed, in the best way, a consum- 
mate man of the world, while at heart so utterly un- 
worldly. His aim in education was to mould men who 
should be good and useful, whatever they might have 
to do ; and with this aim he had cultivated a sense of 
proportion, a perception of the relative importance of 
things, which he always wished to be shared by his 
friends, young or old. For instance, it was rather as 
an educator than as a specialist that he looked at class- 
ical studies ; his ideal scholar was Erasmus, with whom, 
indeed, he had much in common. Erasmus sought, by 
his own methods, to make the best parts of ancient lit- 
erature widely profitable. Jowett, by that translation 
which is so matchless in its grace and charm, has added 
Plato to the favorite authors of thousands who cannot 
read Greek. The future of literary education in En- 
gland was a subject of which he thought much towards 
the close of his life. He would have liked some plan 
in which the great masterpieces of ancient and modern 
literature might equally find a place." 

SONHETS TO PROFESSOR JOWETT. 

Mr. Theodore Watts dedicates to Mr. Swinburne, 
and publishes in the " Athenfeum," these three sonnets 
to the memory of Professor Jowett, with " The Last 
Walk from Boar's Hill" for a title: 



' One after one they go ; and glade and heath, 

Where once we walked with them, and garden-bowers 
They made so dear, are haunted by the hours 

Once musical of them who sleep beneath ; 

One after one does Sorrow's every wreath 
Bind closer you and me with funeral flowers, 
And Love and Memory from each loss of ours 

Forge conquering glaives to quell the conqueror, Death.. 

Since Love and Memory now refuse to yield 

The friend with whom we walk thro' mead and field 

To-day as on that day when last we parted, 
Can he be dead indeed, whatever seem ? 
Love shapes a presence out of Memory's dream v 

A living presence, Jowett golden-hearted. 

ii. 

' Can he be dead ? We walk through flowery ways 
From Boar's Hill down to Oxford, fain to know 
What nugget-gold, in drift of Time's long flow, 
The Bodleian mine hath stored from richer days ; 
He, fresh as on that morn, with sparkling gaze, 
Hair bright as sunshine, white as moonlit snow, 
Still talks of Plato while the scene below 
Breaks gleaming through the veil of sunlit haze. 

Can he be dead ? He shares our homeward walk, 
And by the river you arrest the talk 

To see the sun transfigure ere he sets 
The boatmen's children shining in the wherry 

And on the floating bridge the ply-rope wets, 
Making the clumsy craft an angels' ferry. 

in. 
' The river crossed, we walk 'neath glowing skies 

Through grass where cattle feed or stand and stare 
With burnished coats glassing the colored air 
Fading as color after color dies : 
We pass the copse ; we round the leafy rise 
Start many a coney and partridge, hern and hare ; 
Then win the scholar's nest his simple fare 
Made royal-rich by welcome in his eyes. 

Can he be dead ? His heart was drawn to you : 
Ah ! well that kindred heart within him knew 

The poet's heart of gold that gives his spell : 
Can he be dead ? Your heart being drawn to him, 
How shall ev'n Death make that dear presence dim 

For you who loved him us who loved him well ? "

I iff* 
JUllC. 



Poems by KATE RAWORTH HOLMES. With numerous 
half-tone illustrations by Helen E. Stevenson. Small 
quarto, $2.50. 

The holiday season will scarcely furnish a more attractive gift-book than this, in which the delicate sentiment of the verse is matched by the 
beauty of the letterpress and the unusual illustrations. The opening poem, " One Fair Day," is one of those delightful, sunshiny reminiscences 
whose romance, sung in musical numbers, haunts the memory like a chapter from one's own experience. The bright fulfilment of that " fair day " 
is told in the poem entitled " The Bride." 

mT)n * j ^ Being Studies among the Book-stalls of the Quays. By OCTAVE 
d.1 lo. UZANNE. With an Introduction by AUGUSTINE BIRRELL, and 
144 Characteristic Illustrations interspersed in the Text. Large 8vo, net, $5.00. Large-paper Edition, limited to 25 
copies for America, net, $13.50. 

In this work M. TJzanne has treated a subject in which he has long had a great personal interest, and of which he is peculiarly fitted to write. 
He is full of the enthusiasm of those who truly love old and rare books, and this enthusiasm he transmits to his reader by the felicitous and fas- 
cinating diction of which he is an acknowledged master. The numerous illustrations are drawn with great vigor , and truly illustrate the text. It is 
a superb book. 

By ELIZABETH SHEPPARD. With an Introduction and Notes by HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD. 
With portraits. Uniform with our fine edition of " Charles Auchester" and " Counterparts." 2 vols., 
12mo, gilt tops, $2.50. 

" Rumour " was the last of Miss Sheppard's three most popular romances. Apart from the intrinsic merits of the story, it derives especial 
interest from the fact that Beethoven stands as the model of one of its characters, just as Mendelssohn was portrayed in "Charles Auchester." 
The complete series, "Charles Auchester," "Counterparts," and "Rumour" (six vols., uniformly bound, $7.50), stand alone as romances suf- 
fused with the spirit of music and largely concerned with the lives of musicians. 

By IZAAK WALTON. LIMITED EDITION. Edited, with an Introduction, 
by EDWARD GILPIN JOHNSON. With original border illustrations, printed 
in color. Edition limited to 500 numbered copies. Net $4.00. 
Among the many and beautiful editions of this old classic which have been issued, this one will have a place of its own. It is certainly orig- 
inal in the decorative illustrations which almost cover the wide borders surrounding the text. The 500 copies issued will scarcely be enough to 
supply the many enthusiastic lovers of the genial old philosopher and fisherman. 

f\i Thr*iin-hfc LINKED WITH MEMORIES OF JOHN BRIGHT. Compiled by MARY 

1 1 U U^ 1 1 125. BRIGHT CURRY. 12mo, gilt top, $1.25. 
In this work the compiler, the daughter of John Bright, has collected from various authors some of those passages that were particular 
favorites of her father, and has included with them a few quotations from his own speeches and writings. The uniformly high and noble charac- 
ter of the selections indicates the well-springs whence this pure-minded, generous-hearted statesman drew inspiration to sustain him in his strug- 
gles for truth and justice. 



By AUGUSTUS FILON. Translated by J. V. PRICHARD. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.00. 

This is a faithful and brilliant study of London life in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The times of Reynolds and Garrick, of 
Johnson, and Burke have been carefully studied and skillfully reproduced. The author, with a fine historic sense, has succeeded in conveying 
a true idea of the social and political forces that fermented in the society of London during that remarkable period. 

The Bailiff Of TewkesbUr. ByC. E. D. PHELPS and LEIGH NORTH. Illustrated. $1.00. 



This is an unusually clever and attractive story of English life in the last half of the sixteenth century, the scene being laid in and about 
Tewkesbury and Stratford-pn-Avon. Shakespeare, as a young man, is introduced as one of the characters, with much skill and with perfect 
propriety. It is a story of incident ; the action is vigorous, the descriptions are vivid and truthful, the interest is well sustained, and the atmo- 
sphere is sweet and wholesome.

1 lie L,Oi>l WanyOn OI tne IimeCS. By CHARLES SUMNERSEELEY, author of" The Spanish 

Galleon." 12mo, 275 pages, $1.00. 

A vivid story of adventures among the Cliff-dwellers of Central America. The interest of the reader is held unflaggingly from the beginning 
to the end by the variety of incidents and the vividness of the narrative. It is filled with thrilling adventures which are intricately involved with 
an attractive love story. It is even more absorbing than " The Spanish Galleon " and is told in the same direct and simple style. 

Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers.

"It is an admirable collection, every story being a little masterpiece in its way. The underlying idea of the book is peculiarly felicitous. The 
writers are all eminent, and the stories are fairly representative of them in those qualities that have given them distinction. The volume is fas- 
cinating reading from cover to cover." The Saturday Evening Gazelle, Boston.

J. SELWIN TAIT & SONS' NEW BOOKS. 



THE SOUL OF THE BISHOP. 

By JOHN STRANGE WINTER, author of " Booties' Baby," 
" The Other Man's Wife," etc. Handsomely illus- 
trated, with frontispiece portrait of the author. 12mo, 
cloth; price, $1.25. 

"'Robert Elsmere,' 'John Ward, Preacher,' and 'The Soul of 
the Bishop,' all three books are thoroughly worth reading ; they all 
find their central motive in the conflict of a supersensitive conscience 
which detracts not a whit from the value of each. They all have a cler- 
gyman for a hero, a woman of abnormal moral sensibility for a heroine, 
the love of these as a motive, and the divergence of dogma and reason 
as a catastrophe. . . . ' The Soul of the Bishop ' is a strong book, and 
the questions which it asks are too pertinent to be permanently evaded. " 

The Evening Bulletin, Philadelphia.

patriotic." New York Times. 

" A breezy and interesting book ; has all the candor and independence 
of an anonymous work, and will be read with pleasure and profit." 
New York World. 

" The author is cis- Atlantic to the core, and indulges in some sharp 
rebukes of the Anglomaniacs. The most entertaining book of the day." 

Boston Globe. 

THE CURB OF HONOR. 

By M. BETHAM-EDWARDS, author of " The Romance 
of a French Parsonage." 12rao, cloth; price, $1.00.

Its rise and prosperity has been one of the gratifying 
events of the literary world. Nothing could speak better 
for the existence of a large and intelligent class deeply 
interested in the discussion of serious questions. New 
York Times. 

I regard THE FORUM as a very useful and instruct- 
ive publication, and I should be sorry to lose the read- 
ing of its pages a single month. Judge Strong, U. S. 
Supreme Court (retired). 

I have found that THE FORUM contains the best opin- 
ion of the day on all topics of general interest. Hon. 
James McMillan, United States Senator, Michigan. 



SIZE UNDIMINISHED. 

CHARACTER UNCHANGED. 

THE FORUM contains interpretations of contem- 
poraneous activity and opinion by the best minds of 
both continents. When our foremost men have 
important utterances they seek THE FORUM. Its 
writers, therefore, are the leaders in action and in 
opinion. 

In our time and country men have to do what 
men never had to do before : In politics there are 
new tasks ; in commerce, changing currents ; in in- 
dustry, colossal developments ; in education, new 
methods ; in science, new discoveries ; in society, 
new conditions ; even in religion, new attitudes 
everywhere there is a spirit of inquiry and of ex- 
periment. The foremost men of the world write 
the literature of contemporaneous activity for THE 
FORUM. 

I think THE FORUM one of the best, if not the best, 
of the magazines devoted to general and contemporary 
topics of most interest to us published in this country. 
Judge R. W. Peckham, Judge of Court of Appeals, 
Albany. 

I regard THE FORUM as the very best magazine pub- 
lished in our language, and recall none in any other 
language within the same sphere which is better Hon.

Can you afford to be without these great Magazines in 1894? 



" Its place at the head of all popular periodicals published 
in the English language is no longer disputed anywhere.' 1 ' 1 
ALBANY ARGUS. 

THE CENTURY MAGAZINE 

IN 1894. 

THE GREATEST OF ALL THE MAGAZINES. 

Two Thousand Pages of the Best Literature. 

One Thousand Illustrations by the Greatest Artists 

of the World. 

The program of the new volume of THE CENTURY MAGA- 
ZINE, beginning with the November number, is one of rare 
interest to every reader of literature. The chief serial feat- 
ure is 

A New Novel by 

MARK TWAIN. 

The most dramatic story ever written by America's greatest 
humorist. Like several of Mark Twain's stories, it has for 
its scene a steamboat town on the Mississippi River forty 
years ago. "Pudd'nhead Wilson," a hard-headed country 
lawyer, the hero of the story, furnishes much of the fun that 
one naturally expects to find in a work by the author of " The 
Innocents Abroad," but he appears in quite another light in 
the murder trial which forms the thrilling climax of the story. 
The plot introduces a novel and ingenious employment of 
science in the detection of crime, and the characters are well 
drawn and their every action is interesting. THE CENTURY 
will contain 

A Series of Superb Engravings of the Old 
Dutch Masters ; 

Articles on 
Hunting of Fierce Game ; 

Articles describing 

Artists' Adventures, 

by leading American artists, with their own illustrations ; 
Articles descriptive of 

Important Expeditions 

in all the great continents, including the adventures of two 
young Americans who traversed Asia on bicycles ; 

A novel series on 
Tramping With Tramps: 

How a young man, disguised as a tramp, traveled over Amer- 
ica and learned all the secrets of the " profession "; 
Important Papers on Music 

by the greatest living composers and musicians ; 

Unpublished essays by 
James Russell Lowell; 

Short stories and novelettes by all the leading story-writers, 
essays on timely subjects, humor and fun in the " Lighter 
Vein" department, etc. The

FOR YOUNG FOLKS. 

"WIDE AWAKE" now Merged in it. Enlarged by 
2OO additional Pages in the Volume. 

Everything Illustrated. 

Of all publications for boys and girls, ST. NICHOLAS, con- 
ducted by Mary Mapes Dodge, is unquestionably the best. 
It has been praised by the press and the people of two conti- 
nents, its circulation is unprecedented among magazines for 
young folks. Beginning with the number for November, 
1893, it is enlarged by the addition of about 200 pages in the 
volume, and for 1893-94 it will have the greatest program 
in its history, including

America in a popular way, by W. T. Hornaday, recently Chief 
Taxidermist of the U. S. National Museum ;

THE ONE I KNEW THE BEST OF ALL. 

A Memory of the Mind of a Child. By Mrs. BURNETT. 

Mrs. Burnett's story is unique in literature, being the frankly autobiographical narrative of the experiences of a 
child up to girlhood, with its sensations and emotions as each new phase and problem of life opens to it. 
" It has the engaging candor and transparency of all sincere autobiography, yet it is revealed with such exquisite 
delicacy and absence of self-consciousness we forget that the child heroine is Mrs. Burnett inpi't/o." MRS. KATE 
DOUGLAS WIOOIN. 


POMS AND FASHIONS IN OLD NEW ENGLAND. 

r Mrs. ALICE MORSE EARLE, author of " Sabbath in Puritan New England." 

" Thanks to Mrs. Earle's investigation we may follow the Puritan child from his cradle through his school life, 
through his courtship and marriage, through his holidays and festivals, his sports and diversions, and through his 
periods of illness, until we are finally made witnesses of the ceremonies with which he was committed to the grave. 
There is not one of the fifteen chapters that is not full of interest." New York Sun. 


MEH LADY. 

A Story of the War. By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. 

" Its contrasted humor, force, and pathos put it foremost among any ' Southern,' ' War,' or ' dialect ' stories we 
have ever read." Independent. 
" Mr. Page's heroines are so delightfully sweet and attractive that no one can help falling in love with them ; and 
if anyone can read ' Meh Lady ' without being touched by the infinite pathos of the story, he is a brute beyond 
all redemption." Chicago Herald. 


NIBSY'S CHRISTMAS. 

By JACOB A. Rus. 

Mr. Riis has told the story of "Nibsy's Christmas " and those which follow it in this volume with very effective 
art, but their substance is literally true and forms part of the author's large experience as a police reporter acquainted 
with every phase of the seamy side of the metropolis. Each story and picture has its moral for the humanitarian and 
the social scientist, and each has a vivid, varied, and pathetic individual interest as well. 


THE LAND OF POCO TIEMPO. 

By CHARLES F. LUMMIS. 

Mr. Lummis has made the land of Poco Tiempo New Mexico and adjacent regions his own subject ; and in this 
volume he describes its social customs, racial types, its prodigious ruins and sublime landscapes in his well-known 
vivid and picturesque style. 
"These sketches are picturesque, poetic, glowing in local color, and have a genuine ethnological value showing 
familiarity with the country, the people, and their traditions. Chicago Inter-Ocean. 


WITH THACKERAY IN AMERICA. 

By EYRE CROWE. 

" 'Perfectly delightful ' is the only descriptive epithet for this volume. Mr. Crowe was Thackeray's secretary, 
business man, and artist in the famous lecture tour of 1852-53, and here we have the daily jottings and off-hand 
sketches of that good time of forty years ago. He has painted a moving panorama of that lecture tour for which all 
Thackeray lovers should make him obeisance." Tlte Churchman. 


REMBRANDT: 

lis WORK, AND His TIME. By EMILE MICHEL. Edited by FREDERICK WKDMORE. 

M. Michel's celebrated work is not only a life-like portrait of the man and the artist, but a gallery of reproduc- 
tions in color, in photogravure, and in black and white, of Rembrandt's finest paintings and etchings. These, to the 
number of 320, have been selected from public galleries and famous private collections.

Among the many and beautiful editions of this old classic which have been issued, this one will have a place of its own. It is certainly orig- 
inal in the decorative illustrations which almost cover the wide borders surrounding the text. The 500 copies issued will scarcely be enough to 
supply the many enthusiastic lovers of the genial old philosopher and fisherman.

With portraits. Uniform with our fine edition of " Charles Auchester" and "Counterparts." 2 vols.,

" Rumour " was the last of Miss Sheppard's three most popular romances. Apart from the intrinsic merits of the story, it derives especial 
interest from the fact that Beethoven stands as the model of one of its characters, just as Mendelssohn was portrayed in " Charles Auchester." 
The complete series, "Charles Auchester," "Counterparts," and "Rumour" (six vols., uniformly bound, $7.50), stand alone as romances suf- 
fused with the spirit of music and largely concerned with the lives of musicians.

The Bailiff Of TewkeSbUry. ByC. E. D. PHELPS and LEIGH NORTH. Illustrated. $1.00. 
This is an unusually clever and attractive story of English life in the last half of the sixteenth century, the scene being laid in and about 
Tewkesbury and Stratford-on-Avon. Shakespeare, as a young man, is introduced as one of the characters, with much skill and with perfect 
propriety. It is a story of incident ; the action is vigorous, the descriptions are vivid and truthful, the interest is well sustained, and the atmo- 
sphere is sweet and wholesome. 



By AUGUSTUS FILON. Translated by J. V. PRICHARD. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.00. 

This is a faithful and brilliant study of London life in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The times of Reynolds and Garrick, of 
Johnson, and Burke have been carefully studied and skillfully reproduced. The author, with a fine historic sense, has succeeded in conveying 
a true idea of the social and political forces that fermented hi the society of London during that remarkable period.

1 II e L,O2> I Wd UyUnOl IRC lUlieCs. By CHARLES SUMNER SEELEY, author of ' ' The Spanish 

Galleon." 12mo, 275 pages, $1.00. 

A vivid story of adventures among the Cliff-dwellers of Central America. The interest of the reader is held unflaggingly from the beginning 
to the end by the variety of incidents and the vividness of the narrative. It is filled with thrilling adventures which are intricately involved with 
an attractive love story. It is even more absorbing than " The Spanish Galleon " and is told in the same direct and simple style. 

c LINKED WITH MEMORIES OF JOHN BRIGHT. Compiled by MARY 

5>. BRIGHT CURRY. 12mo, gilt top, $1.25. 

In this work the compiler, the daughter of John Bright, has collected from various authors some of those passages that were particular 
favorites of her father, and has included with them a few quotations from his own speeches and writings. The uniformly high and noble charac- 
ter of the selections indicates the well-springs whence this pure-minded, generous-hearted statesman drew inspiration to sustain him in his strug- 
gles for truth and justice. 

Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers. 

OGDEN. 16mo, vellum cloth, in gilt and colors, gilt top, in a box, $1.25. 

"It is an admirable collection, every story being a little masterpiece in its way. The underlying idea of the book is peculiarly felicitous. The 
writers are all eminent, and the stories are fairly representative of them in those qualities that have given them distinction. The volume is fas- 
cinating reading from cover to cover." The Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston.

J. SELWIN TAIT & SONS' NEW BOOKS. 



THE SOUL OF THE BISHOP. 

By JOHN STRANGE WINTER, author of " Booties' Baby," 
" " The Other Man's Wife," etc. Handsomely illus- 
trated, with frontispiece portrait of the author. 12mo, 
cloth; price, $1.25. 

"'Robert Elsmere,' 'John Ward, Preacher,' and 'The Soul of 
the Bishop,' all three books are thoroughly worth reading; they all 
find their central motive in the conflict of a supersensitive conscience 
which detracts not a whit from the value of each. They all have a cler- 
gyman for a hero, a woman of abnormal moral sensibility for a heroine, 
the love of these as a motive, and the divergence of dogma and reason 
as a catastrophe. . . . ' The Soul of the Bishop ' is a strong book, and 
the questions which it asks are too pertinent to be permanently evaded. " 

The Evening Bulletin, Philadelphia.

SPEARE'S TEMPEST. Printed on India 
paper and mounted in a portfolio, each set signed by 
Mr. Crane. One volume, atlas quarto. Two hundred 
copies, only, are printed for America. $6.00. 

Mr. Crane's beautiful work is too well appreciated to require 
comment beyond the mere announcement that a new series of 
drawings from his pen, containing some of his most successful 
work, is about to be published in a limited edition. 

THE HOBBY HORSE. New Series. A Quar- 
terly Magazine edited by Herbert P. Home, under 
whose management the publication originally appeared 
from 1886 to 1891. A newtitlepage and ornaments are 
designed by Mr. Home, and all copperplates and litho- 
graphs will be printed as India proofs. Large quarto, 
printed on French hand-made paper. Subscriptions 
received only for unbroken sets. $6.00. 

Among the contributors to the magazine are : The late 
Matthew Arnold, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, E. Burne-Jones,

THE HOUSE OF LIFE, BY DANTE 
GABRIEL ROSSETTI : BEING NOW

FULL TEXT. With three ornamental borders

Michallet paper, with rubricated initials, $5.00. 

All lovers of sonnets will welcome this first complete edition 
of what is, without doubt, the most perfect sonnet-sequence in 
the language. 

The form in which the book is presented is one quite new in 
American bookmaking, whose beauty is due in no small degree 
to Mr. Goodhue's charming designs. 

POEMS BY FRANCIS THOMPSON. 

With frontispiece and title-page in photogravure, de- 
signed by Lawrence Housman. Small quarto, $1.50. 

Mr. Thompson is a young Englishman of most extraordinary 
powers, whose life has been spent amid adverse circumstances. 
Browning, in a letter to Mr. Patmore, dated shortly before his 
death, says : " The verse is, indeed, remarkable, even without 
the particulars concerning its author. It is altogether extraor- 
dinary that a young man so naturally gifted should need incite- 
ment to do justice to his conspicuous abilities. Pray assure 
him, if he cares to know it, that I shall have a confident expecta- 
tion of his success." Might these "particulars concerning" 
Mr. Thompson be published, they would make a new chapter 
in the history of Bohemian genius. 

SALOME, A DRAMA IN ONE ACT, BY 
OSCAR WILDE. Newly translated by the au- 
thor from the version in French issued last year in 
Paris. The present edition is illustrated with ten full- 
page designs by Aubrey Beardsley. Small quarto, 
$375- 

Mr. Beardsley' s drawings would make for Salome a wide 
reputation, could any work of Mr Wilde's need an added 
influence. The masterly handling of black and white in more 
than abundant masses is shown to a greater extent in these 
designs than in any previous work Mr. Beardsley has done, 
and cannot fail to influence our illustrative art.

that every book-lover will

CHARLES H. KERR & CO.'S 
New Holiday Books. 

MORE THAN KIN. By JAMES VILA BLAKE. This is 
not a book of sermons, nor of essays, nor is it a novel, yet 
it has some traits of all these. Its thoughts are grouped 
around a simple story of daily living, and through the book 
runs a consecutive study of kindness in its various phases. 
Altogether it is a book to read and re-read. 18mo, 334 
pages, half cloth, $1.00; full cloth, two colors, $1.50. 

AMBER BEADS. Every one who reads the Chicago 
dailies will remember the bright paragraphs on every-day 
topics signed "Amber." In response to many requests, 
sixty-four of the best of these have been put into book form 
by the author. Mr. LEDEREK, the Chicago " Herald " ar- 
tist, has designed the cover. There is a pretty edition in 
paper at 50 cents, and one in cloth at Si. 00. 

ELSIE : A Christmas Story. KJELLAND is the ac- 
knowledged prince of Norwegian fiction writers. " Elsie " 
is his best story, and, strange to say, it has not been pre- 
viously published in this country in the English language, 
though there is more than one Norwegian reprint. Mr. 
MILES M. DAWSON has made a most pleasing translation, 
and the mechanical make-up of the book is unique and 
dainty. Cloth, 50 cents. 

WHERE BROOKS GO SOFTLY. By CHARLES EU- 
GENE BANKS. With frontispiece by T. J. NICHOLL, is one 
of the handsomest gift books of the season. The poems in

JOHN TYNDALL. 

Looking over the death-roll of the past year, 
we are more than once reminded of Lear's 
terrible fatalism : 

'* As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, 
They kill us for their sport." 

Freeman, hardly beyond his prime, found his 
death in a Spanish inn, the victim of a pox- 
infected mattress. Symonds, with many fruitful 
years seemingly before him, was taken off by a 
cold that passed into pneumonia, while return- 
ing from the last of his Italian journeys. To 
Tschaikowsky, on a visit to St. Petersburg, 
death came in a pestilential draught of water, 
and Cholera marked him for her own in the 
fulness of his powers. Last of all, and most 
ironical in its accent, comes word that John 
Tyndall is dead, but from no blow dealt by the 
legitimate assailants of mortality. An overdose 
of chloral, given by the fatal error of a loving 
wife, has cut short that career, prematurely, 
we must say, although the best of his work was 
doubtless accomplished.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Professor Tyndall occupied a large place in 
English scientific thought, and the vacancy 
caused by his death will not easily be filled. 
His original researches resulted in important 
contributions to knowledge, especially in the 
domain of molecular physics. Although they 
do not place him in the first rank of nineteenth 
century Englishmen of science, they secure for 
him a high position in the second. He belongs 
with Professor Huxley and Lord Kelvin, rather 
than with Darwin and Maxwell. He had the 
German training, and he combined the German 
thoroughness with the English instinct for sys- 
tematic and perspicuous presentation. Great 
as was his service in the character of an investi- 
gator, he did a still greater service to his coun- 
trymen in the character of an expositor. What 
Professor Huxley did for the new biology cre- 
ated by Darwin, was done by Professor Tyndall 
for the new physics created by Joule and Far- 
aday and Maxwell. It is customary in certain 
quarters to sneer at popular science ; and there 
is not a little popular science, so-called, which 
justifies the attitude of contempt. But no such 
reproach attaches to the work of men like Tyn- 
dall, whose knowledge of the subjects with 
which he dealt was both thorough and accurate. 
It is difficult to estimate the full value of the 
work done for the advancement of English 
public opinion in matters of science by the group 
of writers to which Tyndall belonged, and of 
which Professor Huxley is the most distin- 
guished remaining representative. They came 
at just the right time, and they brought just 
the right kind of powers to their task. Without 
the labors of these men, the great nineteenth 
century revolution in physical and biological 
science would indeed have been, none the later, 
& fait accompli ; but it would have taken much 
longer to reach the popular consciousness. 

Professor Tyndall stood in the vanguard of 
the revolutionary forces, and bore the brunt of 
the battle. Twenty years ago, he incurred the 
odium, theologicum by an article in " The Con- 
temporory Keview," proposing that the efficacy 
of prayer should be subjected to a scientific test. 
He little thought, good easy man, what a hor- 
nets' nest this cold-blooded suggestion would 
bring about his ears. When, in the year fol- 
lowing this incident, he was presented at Oxford 
for the honorary doctorate, he found his can- 
didacy bitterly opposed by one of the professors 
of divinity in the University, on the ground that 
his teachings contravened " the whole tenor of 
that book, which with its open page inscribed 
Dominus ittnminatio meet the University still 



bears as her device." Only a year later than 
this, his address before the Belfast meeting of 
the British Association, in which address he 
professed to discern in matter " the promise and 
potency of every form and quality of life," again 
aroused his theological opponents, and fanned 
afresh the flame of their zealous indignation. 
Only three or four years before these occur- 
rences, Professor Huxley, in a lecture upon 
Descartes, speaking of the religious persecution 
of which that philosopher was a victim, had 
said : " There are one or two living men, who, 
a couple of centuries hence, will be remembered 
as Descartes is now, because they have produced 
great thoughts which will live and grow as long 
as mankind lasts. If the twenty-first century 
studies their history, it will find that the Chris- 
tianity of the middle of the nineteenth century 
recognized them only as objects of vilification." 
The vilification to which Tyndall was subjected, 
in consequence of the acts above alluded to, 
came as a prompt and striking new illustration 
of Professor Huxley's remark. 

Most earnest men, watching the world from 
day to day, get impatient because it moves so 
slowly. And yet, looking back over a few years, 
the same men will find cause for astonishment 
at the rapidity of its advance in this nineteenth 
century of ours. The Copernican doctrine re- 
quired from one to two centuries to make its 
way ; the Darwinian doctrine accomplished an 
equal revolution of thought in one or two de- 
cades. The suggestions that seemed so startling 
when made by Tyndall twenty years ago would 
to-day hardly cause a ripple of excitement any- 
where. Few intelligent people, whatever their 
religious beliefs, are now shocked at the admis- 
sion of spontaneous generation as a necessary 
link in the evolutionary chain, and few of them 
hold to a doctrine of prayer that invites such 
tests as that proposed by Tyndall in the early 
seventies. Of recent years, Tyndall has been 
assailed by the politicians almost as vehemently 
as he was once assailed by the theologians, and 
time will bring him a justification similar to that 
which it has brought him in the earlier con- 
troversy. In his denunciation of the recent 
Gladstonian attempt to dismember the United 
Kingdom he joined himself with such men as 
Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, and his mem- 
ory need fear no defeat in that alliance. 

The noble intellectual temper of the man 
that has just died, the bent of mind which we 
venture to call essentially religious in spite of the 
religious antagonisms which it evoked, and the 
eloquence of expression that he knew how to im- 



1893.]

part to the subjects which so deeply concerned 
him, may most fittingly be illustrated by the clos- 
ing paragraph of the famous Belfast Address : 
" And now the end is come. With more time, or 
greater strength and knowledge, what has been here 
said might have been better said, while worthy matters 
here omitted might have received fit expression. But 
there would have been no material deviation from the 
views set forth. As regards myself, they are not the 
growth of a day; and as regards you, I thought you 
ought to know the environment which, with or without 
your consent, is rapidly surrounding you, and in rela- 
tion to which some adjustment on your part may be 
necessary. A hint of Hamlet's, however, teaches us all 
how the troubles of common life may be ended; and it 
is perfectly possible for you and me to purchase intel- 
lectual peace at the price of intellectual death. The 
world is not without refuges of this description; nor is 
it wanting in persons who seek their shelter and try to 
persuade others to do the same. I would exhort yon 
to refuse such shelter, and to scorn such base repose 
to accept, if the choice be forced upon you, commotion 
before stagnation, the leap of the torrent before the 
stillness of the swamp. In the one there is at all events 
life, and therefore hope; in the other, none. I have 
touched on debatable questions, and led you over dan- 
gerous ground and this partly with the view of tell- 
ing you, and through you the world, that as regards 
these questions science claims unrestricted right of 
search. It is not to the point to say that the views of 
Lucretius and Bruno, of Darwin and Spencer, may be 
wrong. Here I should agree with you, deeming it in- 
deed certain that these views will undergo modification. 
But the point is, that, whether right or wrong, we claim 
the right to discuss them. The ground which they cover is 
scientific ground ; and the right claimed is one made good 
through tribulation and anguish, inflicted and endured 
in darker times than ours, but resulting in the immor- 
tal victories which science has won for the human race. 
I would set forth equally the inexorable advance of 
man's understanding in the path of knowledge, and the 
unquenchable claims of his emotional nature which the 
understanding can never satisfy. The world embraces 
not only a Newton, but a Shakespeare not only a 
Boyle, but a Raphael not only a Kant, but a Beethoven 
not only a Darwin, but a Carlyle. Not in each of 
these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not 
opposed, but supplementary not mutually exclusive, 
but reconcilable. And if, still unsatisfied, the human 
mind, with the yearning of a pilgrim for his distant 
home, will turn to the mystery from which it has 
emerged, seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to 
thought and faith, so long as this is done, not only with- 
out intolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the en- 
lightened recognition that ultimate fixity of conception 
is here unattainable, and that each succeeding age must 
be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance with 
its own needs then, in opposition to all the restric- 
tions of materialism, I would affirm this to be a field 
for the noblest exercise of what, in contrast with the 
knowing faculties, may be called the creative faculties 
of man. Here, however, I must quit a theme too great 
for me to handle, but which will be handled by the 
loftiest minds ages after you and I, like streaks of 
morning cloud, shall have melted into the infinite azure 
of the past." 

This fine peroration, which we have quoted in 



its entirety, serves better than a volume of 
comment to explain the influence which Tyn- 
dall has exerted upon his contemporaries, and 
especially upon the younger generation. The 
scientist of the dryasdust type may scoff at 
it as mere rhetoric, but it has stirred many of 
its readers as with a trumpet-call to steadfast- 
ness and honesty of purpose in the pursuit of 
truth. The power to write in this fashion, 
backed by the power to employ the most rigor- 
ious of scientific methods in his own researches, 
made of Tyndall one of the most vital of the 
directive intellectual forces of his age, and 
brings to his memory a host of mourners who 
early caught the contagion of his spirit, and 
have sought to follow in his footsteps. 

BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

John Tyndall was born August 21, 1820, in the 
village of Leighlin Bridge, Carlow, Ireland. His 
parents were poor, and could give him only a com- 
mon-school education. In 1839 he took a position 
with the Irish Ordnance Survey. In 1844, he be- 
came a railway engineer. In 1847, he became a 
teacher in Queenwood College, Hants, a technical 
school. Here he met Dr. Frankland, and his stud- 
ies were definitely turned in the direction of phys- 
ical science. The next year he went to Germany, 
and studied at Marburg under Bunsen and others. 
From Marburg he went to Berlin and there contin- 
ued his studies under Magnus. His first scientific 
paper was on screw-surfaces, and his second a study 
in the magnetic properties of crystals. The latter 
was published in 1850. He then returned to En- 
gland, and settled in London, where he became ac- 
quainted with Faraday. In 1852 he was elected a 
Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1853 was ap- 
pointed a professor of natural philosophy in the 
Royal Institution of Great Britain. He afterwards 
succeeded Faraday as Superintendent of that Insti- 
tution. He had already, as early as 1849, visited 
the Alps for recreation, and the habit thus acquired 
lasted for the rest of his lifetime, resulting, among 
other things, in that classic of mountaineering, 
" Hours of Exercise in the Alps " (1871 ). His first 
scientific expedition to the Alps was made in 1856, 
in company with Professor Huxley, and resulted in 
the joint treatise " On the Structure and Motion of 
Glaciers." Other fruits of his Alpine experiences 
were the "Glaciers of the Alps " (I860), and " A 
Vacation Tour " (1863). In 1859 he began his re- 
searches in radiant heat, which resulted in the works, 
" Heat as a Mode of Motion " (1863), " On Radi- 
ation " (1865), and "Contributions to Molecular 
Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat." He pub- 
lished a work on " Sound " in 1865, and a similar 
volume on " Light " in 1870. Other publications 
of this period were "Faraday as a Discoverer" 
(1868), "On the Scientific Use of the Imagina- 
tion" (1870), the first volume of "Fragments of 



380

Science" (1871), and "The Forms of Water" 
(1872). In this latter year he lectured in the 
United States, giving thirty-five addresses in all. 
These lectures were largely attended, and the net 
proceeds, amounting to S23,000, were placed in the 
hands of a committee to be used for the endow- 
ment of research in American colleges. Cambridge 
had made him an LL.D. in 1855 and Edinburgh 
in 1866 ; in 1873 Oxford made him, despite the pro- 
test of the theologians, a D.C.L. The Belfast Ad- 
dress was given in 1874. In 1876 he married the 
eldest daughter of Lord Claud Hamilton. He has 
held a number of posts under the English govern- 
ment. Among his later works may be mentioned 
"On the Transmission of Sound by the Atmo- 
sphere" (1874), "Lessons in Electricity" (1876), 
"Fermentation" (1877), "Essays on the Floating 
Matter of the Air" (1881), and a second series of 
the popular " Fragments of Science " (1892). He 
died on the fourth of this month at his home in 
Haslemere, Surrey. 



RADCLIFFE COLLEGE. . 

The change of name and of constitution whereby 
the Harvard Annex has become Radcliffe College 
calls for the heartiest congratulations from all work- 
ers in behalf of the higher education of women. At 
the same time, the nature of the change effected has 
been in some respects misinterpreted by the news- 
paper reports. To correct mistaken impressions, we 
reprint the resolutions in which the new plan is for- 
mulated. These resolutions were passed by the An- 
nex Corporation, and accepted by the Corporation 
and Overseers of the University. 

"Voted, That it is desirable to change the name of 
this corporation to Radcliffe College, and that proper 
legal steps be taken to effect that change. 

" Voted, That it is desirable that this corporation give 
degrees in arts and sciences, and that a committee of 
three persons be appointed by the president to take steps 
to obtain from the legislature the necessary power. 

" Voted, That the president and fellows of Harvard 
College be and hereby are made and appointed the vis- 
itors of this corporation, and hereby vested with all vis- 
itorial power and authority as fully as if the same had 
been originally conferred upon the said president and 
fellows by the charter or articles of association of this 
corporation. This vote shall take effect upon an ac- 
ceptance by the said president and fellows of the powers 
hereby conferred, but with the provision that the said 
president and fellows at any time may abandon and sur- 
render or limit such powers upon notice to this corpor- 
ation. 

"Voted, That no instructor or examiner of this cor- 
poration shall be appointed, employed, or retained with- 
out the approval of the visitors of this corporation man- 
ifested in such way as said visitors may prescribe. 

"Voted, That in case the president and fellows of 
Harvard College accept the powers conferred by the 
foregoing vote, the said president and fellows be re- 
quested to empower the president of Harvard Univer- 
sity to countersign the diplomas of this corporation and 
to affix the seal of Harvard University to said diplomas." 



The change has not been made, as has been stated, 
in consequence of any endowment, nor does it mean 
co-education. But it does provide for bestowing the 
University degree upon graduates of what has been 
known as the Annex, in place of the certificates 
heretofore issued. The institution has recently 
come into possession of two gifts, amounting, jointly, 
to about $150,000. Since the fees from students 
have exceeded the expenses of the Annex for the 
past five years, the new college is in a satisfactory 
financial condition. Its name is, very appropriately, 
that of the first woman who ever made a gift of 
money to Harvard. 



THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ROMANCE. 

The now palpable reaction from the realistic, so- 
called, in English fiction to the romantic as a form 
and a method, suggests an historical retrospect. 
The fact is, the romance, in its several kinds, has 
persisted for centuries in our native novel, and 
its resurgence to-day is only a demonstration to 
be prophesied from past experiences in fictional 
evolution. Nor is the explanation far to seek. All 
the world loves a story, as it does a lover; and 
psychologic interest, the analysis of motive and 
character, will never take the place of that object- 
ive interest which centres in action, situation, and 
denouement. Our age takes more kindly to such 
methods and motives than did its predecessors ; in- 
deed, it has been taught to do so, and the novel of 
subjective tendency may be styled the chosen vehi- 
cle of expression. But always those who read as 
they run. and the more critical class which seeks in 
books illusion from the workaday world, will desire 
the adventure story and the heroic presentment of 
human life. A host of people agree with Balzac 
that the writer of fiction should strive to portray 
society not solely as it is, but as it is hoped it will 
be in that "possibly better" state suggested by 
present improvement. One is struck by this in the 
simple inductive process of inquiry among intelli- 
gent book-lovers ; the present writer has found that 
a large proportion go to novels for rest and recrea- 
tion, rather than for a criticism of life or aesthetic 
stimulation, least of all for spiritual profit. If this 
last is to result, let it be unobtrusive, by way of in- 
direction, not through the avowed tendenz fiction, 
seems to be the cry. 

Text-books are fond of emphasizing the birth of 
the modern analytic novel with Richardson and 
Fielding, as if thereafter the whole trend were 
toward the subjective social study. It is true 
enough that a new impulse and manner were intro- 
duced by those worthies ; but twenty odd years be- 
fore "Pamela" and "Tom Jones," De Foe's "Rob- 
inson Crusoe" was in the field to represent that 
undying creature, the Romance ; and if Mr. Kipling 
and Mr. Stevenson', Mr. Hall Caine, Dr. Doyle and 
General Wallace hark back to the seamy Daniel as 
prototype, he in turn derives from the picaresque 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



381 



tales that had gone before, and, to look to origins, 
is justified by the Spanish fictionists from whom our 
romance sprang. An early English example of the 
picaresque is Nash's "Jack Wilton," which, clumsy 
as it is, and naively childish to modern taste, does 
nevertheless explain De Foe on the one hand and 
the penny-dreadful on the other. Jack, a page in 
the English army in France at the siege of Tourney, 
and a fellow of infinite gusto, much travel, and 
many escapades, is perhaps the first picturesque 
rascal in a genre to be afterwards enriched by Du- 
mas and broadened and modified by Le Sage, Hugo, 
Scott, and Dickens. He is the father of harum- 
scarums, and he initiates for all time the type of 
the picaresque story that division of the romance 
the essence of which lies in brisk, breathless adven- 
turing, and a lusty enjoyment of life as incident 
and spectacle. Such later divisions, of course, as 
the pastoral romance early exampled in Lyly's 
4 'Euphues" and Sidney's "Arcadia," and finding 
its modern representation in Mr. Black, Mr. Black- 
more, and others, and the bombastic pseudo- 
romance borrowed from the French of Scarron et 
Cie., and thank heaven pretty much dead to-day, 
swell with contributory streams the now stately 
river of romance. But the adventure -tale that 
eventuates in "Kidnapped" and "The Refugees" 
is to be tracked down to "Jack Wilton," artless 
product of Elizabethan times. 

Nor, if we overlook the mere matter of prose 
form, may we hesitate to go further back in look- 
ing for the genesis of the spirit and purpose of the 
English romance. We shall meet with it several 
centuries earlier, in that sterling, sturdy literary 
form the ballad ; in certain of the verse narratives 
of Chaucer ; yes, in the Old English epics them- 
selves. Other times, other customs, and saga, epic, 
apologue, ballad, or novel may be the chosen vehi- 
cle ; but the liking for story is a constant factor. 
The instinct for romance is the instinct for illu- 
sion, a request for pictures of a livelier and love- 
lier world than that we live in ; it were foolish not 
to expect its gratification in art all along in the de- 
velopment of our literature. With this continual 
outcropping, this cyclic persistence, of the romance 
in English fiction, notable contributions in this kind 
may be anticipated in the near future as a rebound 
from the deification of the psycho-analytic. The 
public is eager for it ( apply the test of sales in the 
case of recent prominent romantic novels) ; and the 
writers of fiction take heart for the attempt, or by 
a natural resilience are of the tribe of Dan. But 
whether the movement produce marvels of roman- 
tic composition this decade or the next century, it 
is safe to say that the field will always be cultivated, 
appealing as it does to a permanent taste and sat- 
isfying an inevitable hunger. By no means is it to 
be said that the school of Messrs. Howells and 
James is in its decadence ; fruitful and important 
work is sure to come thence, and its possibilities, 
especially in the domain of psychology, are as yet 
but half realized. But it is well to bear down on 



the fact that the pedigree of this school is no better 
than, is indeed not so old and honorable as, that 
which has De Foe as past-master in the last century 
and is vigorously championed in Jin de siecle En- 
glish letters by Messrs. Kipling and Stevenson. 

And it should be understood that this reaction 
toward incident in fiction is a phase of the wider 
protest against the abuse of that misnamed realism 
for which partialism is a fitter term. It is part of 
a tendency which has produced in Paris, the strong- 
hold of the opposite influence, a revival denomi- 
nated neo-idealism, resulting in symbolism in poetry 
and M. Wagner's noble trumpet-call to the younger 
generation. Romanticism is to idealism in the novel 
what the garment is to the soul. In this broader 
implication, the romance includes Mrs. Ward's 
" David Grieve " and Mrs. Hunt's " Ramona," books 
treating life in its more ideal aims and relations. 
The romance of the future will present such high 
interests keeping pace with the evolution of society ; 
and its vantage-ground over the romance of years 
agone will be that it is firm-based on truth to the 
phenomena of life, and is thus, in the only true 
sense, realistic. Nobler in content, and persist- 
ent in type, the romance, broadly viewed, may be 
regarded as that form of literature which more 
than any other shall reflect the aspirations of the 
individual and the social progress of the state.

SONNET-GOLD. 



We get it from Etruscan tombs, hid deep 
Beneath the passing ploughshare ; or from caves, 
Known but to Prospero, where pale green waves 

Roll up the wreck-gold that the mermaids keep ; 

And from the caverns where the gnomes upheap 
The secret treasures which the Earth's dwarf slaves 
Coin in her bosom, 'til the red gold paves 

Her whole great heart, where only poets peep ; 

Or from old missals, where the gold defies 

Time's tooth, in saints' bright aureoles, and keeps, 
In angels' long straight trumpets, all its flash ; 

But mostly from the crucible where lies 

The alchemist's pure dream-gold : while he sleeps 
The poet steals it, leaving him the ash. 

ii. 
What shall we make of sonnet-gold for men ? 

The dove-wreathed cup some youth to Phryne gave ? 

Or dark Locusta's scent-phial, that shall have, 
Chiselled all round it, snakes from Horror's den ? 

Or that ill ring which sank in fathoms ten 
When Faliero spoused the Venice wave ? 
Or Inez' funeral crown, the day the grave 

Showed her for coronation, all myrrh then ? 

The best would be to make a hilt of gold 

For Life's keen falchion ; like a dragon's head, 
Fierce and fantastic, massive in your hold ; 

But oft the goldsmith's chisel makes instead 

A fretted shrine for sorrows that are old, 
And passions that are sterile or are dead.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE LIBRARY OF THE CHICAGO UNIVERSITY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your excellent notice, in the current number of 
THE DIAL, of the recently issued government report on 
Libraries, you refer to the statement, made in that re- 
port, as to the four largest libraries in the country, for 
the purpose of pointing out an error by which the Bos- 
ton Public Library is credited with too large a number 
of volumes. Apparently you overlooked the fact that 
the most glaring discrepancy in the list is in assigning 
to the University of Chicago 380,000 volumes. I am 
just collecting the statistics of libraries for my forth- 
coming book, " Public Libraries in America," and Mrs. 
Dixson, the acting librarian of the University of Chi- 
cago, gives me the present number of volumes as about 
250,000. The recently issued Register of the Univer- 
sity puts the number at 232,000. Mrs. Dixson reports 
that 75,000 of the present 250,000 have been acquired 
during the past twelve months, so that the library can 
hardly have numbered more than 150,000 volumes 
when this U. S. report was made up. How its size came 
to be so over-stated is an interesting question.

Amherst College Library, Dec. 5, 1893. 

[We did not question the figures given for the 
library of the University of Chicago, because no 
one seems to know just what those figures should 
really be. The bulk of the library is made up of a 
collection purchased from Calvary, of Berlin, nearly 
two years ago. This collection seems to have been 
purchased on the "pig in a poke" principle, and 
was estimated to include something like 300,000 
volumes, a large proportion of these (perhaps one- 
fourth) being unbound dissertations. We under- 
stand that the whole of this collection has not yet 
been housed in the library. It was, however, owned 
by the University at the time when the government 
report was prepared. From statements made to 
us at various times by the authorities of the Univer- 
sity, we concluded that the number of volumes re- 
ported was approximately correct, if pamphlets were 
counted, as in the case of the Harvard (not the 
Boston Public) Library. The report of 232,000 
volumes in the University Register expressly ex- 
cludes pamphlets and books not actually in the 
library. EDR. DIAL.] 

"AIRS AND MANNERS" IN THE OLD DOMINION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In reading Mr. Thomas Nelson Page's rather florid 
article on " The Old Dominion," in the December "Har- 
per," one cannot but be struck by the continuous strain 
of old-time laudation of Virginia and everything Vir- 
ginian, that savors strongly of the somewhat boastful 
period " before the war." The women are prettier, the 
men more brilliant and gallant, the children more inter- 
esting, and all, old or young, " have something about 
them an air, a manner, a something which is more 
attractive" than one can discover in mortals north of the 
Potomac. Altogether, it is a picture in high lights; 
there are no shadows. One may read the article from 
beginning to end, without discovering that a Virginian 



ever had a fault. Mr. Page's Colonel Carters of Car- 
tersville have all the virtues of Mr. Hopkinson Smith's, 
but none of their weaknesses. They even talked so- 
well that " it is said that Thackeray stated that he heard 
the purest Saxon English in Virginia that he had ever 
heard. Freeman and Matthew Arnold are quoted to 
the same effect at a later time." 

But the reader who is curious to note the signs of the 
times will find more significance in the political than 
in the social aspects of Mr. Page's article, coming as it 
does from a writer who has grown up since the war. 
There is nowhere in it so much as a hint that the Vir- 
ginians were wrong in following the hot-headed and 
unreasoning states of the South into that rebellion which 
Virginia first condemned and then embraced. On the 
contrary, the tone of approval and laudation is still dom- 
inant. In speaking of Richmond, the writer says that 
" for a hundred years and more the city has been asso- 
ciated with all that Virginians are proud of"; and he 
then proceeds to enumerate some of the things of which 
they are proud: " Here sat and deliberated [!] the Se- 
cession Convention during the period when Virginia 
stood as the peace-maker between the two sections. 
Here she finally declared her decision to secede from 
the Union. . . . Here the Confederate government 
passed its life, and from here the Southern side of the 
war was fought. . . . Whilst Richmond stood the 
Confederacy stood," etc. Such are the things that give 
the city its chief glory in the eyes of true Virginians. 

Northern conservatives, who have been inclined to 
sympathize with the South in its recent unfortunate 
condition, will be surprised and pained to read many 
things in this article. They have been wont to think 
that sensible Southern people had seen that the Rebel- 
lion, with its fruitless loss and devastation, was at least 
a mistake, and not a thing to be especially proud of ; 
but such utterances as these will lead many to doubt 
whether it is not yet too early to cherish or express 
sympathy with those who still maintain such sentiments. 
It seems a pity that such an article should have been 
written or printed, representing as it does a class who 
have learned nothing from experience, and have forgot- 
ten the present and the future in blind admiration of an 
ignorant and often mistaken past. A. C. McC.

WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH JOHN BULL? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

To a logical mind, there is always a satisfaction in 
finding persons and things consistent with themselves; 
and this form of satisfaction is ours on reading the 
characteristic comments of the leading John Bull organ, 
the " Saturday Review," on the subject of the Colum- 
bian Exposition, as reprinted in your last issue. Those 
comments are about such as might have been expected 
from such a source ; hence they afford the logical satis- 
faction referred to, and are also delightful in many 
ways. Nowhere else could we expect to find, at this 
stage, the Exposition styled a " local show " and a " fiz- 
zle," or its promoters and managers so courteously and 
discerningly individualized as "the ignorant million- 
aire, the grain-man, the pig-man, the bust dude, the 
Irish politician, the anarchist," as it is given in the ele- 
gant phraseology of this uncompromising defender of 
the classic. No one who knows the John Bull type of 
Englishmen will be surprised that they should regard 
the Exposition as a " local show." Of course it seems 
local to them; anything beyond the coast of Britain is,

to the arboreal fancy of these belated Druids, necessa- 
rily local and despisable. 

It seems to me the practical question is, how shall 
these familiar exhibitions of " John Bull at his worst " 
be treated in America ? Shall his primitive insularity 
and his native proneness to Philistinism be regarded, in 
Carlyle's phrase, as an " insuperable proclivity," and 
therefore he be let alone ? Or, if to familiarize him 
with modern ideas and world-tendencies be thought 
possible and desirable, how shall the requisite mission- 
ary labors be directed ? And ought we not to take into 
account what we should lose if these efforts were success- 
ful ? Is not J. B. more amusing, and hence more de- 
sirable, as he is ? Byron, a good judge of European 
traits and manners, recorded his opinion as follows: 

" The world is a big load of hay ; 

Mankind are the asses that pull ; 
Each tugs in a different way 
But the greatest of all is John Bull." 

Would it not, therefore, be more profitable to us Amer- 
icans, who inherit still a trace of the bear-baiting pro- 
clivities of our British ancestry, to allow him to con- 
tinue in his favorite role as the ass par excellence among 
national characters ? Who is there to take his place ? 
where else among the nations of the earth could so 
amusing a character such a possierlicher Dummkopf 
be found ? Unameliorated by the refining influences of 
foreign civilization, John Bull is pretty sure to be John 
Bull for a long time to come; hugging himself closer 
in his insularity, and throwing dust and mud over every- 
thing that is new and unintelligible to him which 
leaves to him yet a very large field for the exercise of 
his peculiar powers. All these points and more are in- 
volved in the interesting problem, What shall we do 
with John Bull ? JONATHAN. 

Chicago, Dec. 6, 1893. 



A DISCLAIMER AND AN EXPLANATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As was the surprise of Monsieur Jourdain, on being 
told that he talked prose, even so was mine, when I 
found myself credited by Mr. W. H. Johnson (in THE 
DIAL for Nov. 1) with a "style," nay, "a peculiarity 
of style." There are, however, in the case of every one, 
things growing out of his idiosyncrasy which others are 
beforehand with him in discovering. 

Reputation for a literary style those may spell for 
who are so inclined ; but why should it be assumed that 
I am one of them? As to the way in which my trivi- 
alities are expressed, I have never given the subject a 
thought, regard for intelligibility and verbal economy 
excepted. A commonplace person who aims at no more 
than this, and succeeds in his aim fairly well, will deliver 
himself only indifferently, at best; and to say that he 
has a style, or effects any approach to one worth speak- 
ing of, is, it appears to me, making too much of his 
insignificance. My fashion of writing, which I had all 
along thought to be precisely such as that just described, 
was, I had hoped, so unnoticeable as not to divert atten- 
tion from my matter to my manner. My hopes have 
been doomed to disappointment. 

Mr. Johnson is of opinion that my sentences too often 
have a " broken character." Let me, in passing, regret 
that they have broken his aesthetic repose. To make 
good his complaint, he quotes from me at length, adding 
the judgment that parallels to his quotations " would not 
be from writers who have won any reputation for grace- 



ful expression of their ideas." But, as a prudent cripple 
would not attempt to dance, why should Awk O'Speech 
be ambitious of a distinction which he knows he could 
never achieve, do what he might? Suppose that nature 
and circumstances, in malign conspiracy, have turned a 
man out rhetorically left-handed, crump-shouldered, 
lop-sided, baker-kneed, ungainly all round. What is 
there, pray, for such a hapless abortion to do, except to 
throw himself on the compassion of his fellow-creatures, 
and to thank destiny that there are constellations more 
sinister than the one which was told off for him? We 
all of us write pretty much as it pleases Providence. 

Brevis esse laboro, dbscurus Jio, I shall not admit. 
Though I study to be concise, my drift, unless I deceive 
myself, is always unmistakable. Nor is perplexity 
entailed by the involutions which, brevity consulted, are 
frequently necessitated by the qualifications requisite in 
order to the exact conveyance of my meaning. Where 
these involutions occur, and also on other occasions, I 
try to lighten the labor of the reader by free recourse 
to commas, using them largely instead of brackets ; and 
hence it is that Mr. Johnson detects, in my sentences, 
what he designates as a " broken character." This de- 
signation is not, to my mind, altogether appropriate. 
Be that as it may, however, my critic is perhaps a trifle 
flattering, when he silently takes it for granted that 
others, if unaided by the clue of liberal punctuation, 
would approve themselves his match in threading my 
labyrinths. 

The question of expressional uncouthness having been 
started, I transcribe some specimens of it, in presence 
of which those that Mr. Johnson takes from me must 
hide their diminished heads. I came on them in Thomas 
Hope's " Essay on the Origin and Prospects of Man," 
published in 1831 : 

" Sometimes, after of compounds certain substances are, by 
effervescence or fermentation, thrown off, the remaining ones, 
instead of being left to subside, again from without take in 
new gases, which again of the compound change the nature 
and the faculties." (Vol. I., p. 293.) 

" Of the heat in the daytime from the sun radiated to the 
earth, at night, when, of this radiance from without the pres- 
sure ceases, a certain portion is from the earth and from its 
productions again radiated into outer space." (Vol. I., p. 294. ) 

" Thus, of heat a certain portion, in a body by cold solidi- 
fied penetrating, confined and accumulated, till by its pressure 
from within that body on its surrounding envelopes, it dis- 
tends and dissevers these inclosures, and is again by them 
let out and left to cooperate, will by the very excess of its 
strength lose that strength, and again, as it again spreads 
further, proportionably weaken." (Vol. III., p. 222.) 

That these passages fell from the pen of the author 
of " Anastasius " seems almost incredible. 

For curiosities of felonious construction well-nigh as 
striking as those given from Hope, Jeremy Bentham, 
among modern authors, might be cited to any extent 
whatever, desirable or undesirable. Guided by a ra- 
tional taste, Sydney Smith, in reviewing the famous 
" Book of Fallacies," introduces its author to the public 
only " after that eminent philosopher has been washed, 
trimmed, shaved, and forced into clean linen." 

Whitefield, we read, once fancied, for a while, that 
the Lord "required him to go nasty"; and not a few 
writers, entreated spitefully by the fates, and wrestling 
with them in vain, " go nasty," metaphorically, all their 
days. The pity which the benevolent are moved to 
bestow on their unhappy case I would be allowed to 
participate. F. H.

WALTER SCOTT'S TJETTERS.* 



In the preface to the abridged edition (1848) 
of his Life of Scott, Lockhart inserted the 
following paragraph : " I should have been 
iiiore willing to produce an enlarged edition ; 
for the interest of Sir Walter's history lies, 1 
think, peculiarly in its minute details espe- 
cially in the details set down by himself in his 
letters and diaries ; and, of course, after the 
lapse of ten years more copious use might be 
made of those materials without offense or 
indecorum." Near half a century has elapsed 
since these words were penned ; and in the 
interim the " Journal " covering the period 
from 1825, just before the Constable and the 
Ballantyne failures, to 1835, the year of Scott's 
death has appeared. The "Life" and the 
" Journal " having thus been issued, only the 
" Letters " were needed to complete this unu- 
sually full, rich, and significant life-record ; and 
these now lie before us. The editor, Mr. David 
Douglas, has executed his trust with the same 
care and minuteness shown in his editing of 
the " Journal " perhaps this time with some- 
thing of that loving over-elaboration which one 
is apt to bestow upon a specially congenial task. 
The letters are placed in chronological order, 
and they are grouped in twenty-four brief chap- 
ters, each of which is prefaced by a useful table 
of " Family Annals and Literary Work," as 
well as by a rather supererogatory motto, gen- 
erally a passage selected from Sir Walter's 
poetical works. Mr. Douglas's notes are very 
full unf ashionably full ; but they are in them- 
selves so entertaining, so rich in lively personal 
chat and ana, that we should be sorry to spare 
one of them. The letters range from 1797, 
the year of the writer's marriage, to 1825, the 
eve of the period when, at the age of fifty-five, 
overwhelmed by a debt of 150,000, he sat 
down at his desk to begin a struggle for honor's 
sake which was to end six years later, not in a 
loss of courage, but in a decline of the powers 
necessary to carry it on. The annals of Scotia 
are eminently rich in examples of patient hero- 
ism in adversity a quality that, like love of 
clan and country, seems inherent in her people. 
But none of her plaided or her mail-clad heroes 
have shown a braver front to disaster than did 
her great romancer. To Scott, filled as he was 
with the (to the modern view) Quixotic tradi-

tions and ideals which formed the flower and 
finer spirit of the older Toryism Feudalism, if 
you will the call of honor, the claim of an 
obligation, was a peremptory one that brooked 
no denial or thought of denial. The distinction, 
born of commercial usage and expediency, be- 
tween a mercantile and personal obligation, was 
not for him. To the Master of Abbotsford a 
debt incurred was a debt to be wiped out to 
the uttermost farthing ; and so he labored on 
to the end, with the dogged pertinacity of his 
nation, at the Sisyphus-stone of vicarious debt 
that finally crushed him. 

In making up the present volumes, the editor 
has prudently and widely departed from his 
original plan of including in them only the 
letters addressed by Sir Walter to members of 
his own family. A number of letters written 
to some of his closest friends have also been 
introduced ; and in addition to these are some 
notable ones addressed to Sir Walter by such 
correspondents as Jeffrey, Lady Stuart, Joanna 
Baillie, Crabbe, Charles Lamb (who makes an 
appeal in behalf of the impecunious Godwin), 
Washington Irving, etc. The letter from the 
last-named writer is the reply to a proposal to 
become editor of a Scotch newspaper a post 
for which Irving acknowledged himself to be 
eminently unsuited. He writes : 

" Your literary proposal both surprises and flatters 
me, as it evinces a much higher opinion of my talents 
and capacity than I possess myself. I am peculiarly 
unfitted for the post proposed. . . . My whole course 
of life has been desultory, and I am unfitted for any 
periodically recurring task, or any stipulated labor of 
body or mind. I have no command over my talents 
such as they are; am apt to be deserted by them when 
I most want their assistance, and have to watch the 
veerings of my mind as I would those of a weather- 
cock. Practice and training may briug me more into 
rule, but at present I am as unfit for service in the 
ranks as one of my own country Indians or a Don Cos- 
sack. I must therefore keep on pretty much as I have 
begun, writing when I can and not when I would." 

The " Letters " begin, as we have said, in 
1797, the year of Scott's marriage ; and the 
opening ones, addressed to Miss Carpenter, 
afford, it must be owned, some rather doleful 
specimens of the Caledonian love-letter. The 
last one, in particular, closes with a passage 
that would have done credit to Mr. Pegotty's 
" lone and lorn " inmate, Mrs. Gumniidge : 

" When you go to the South of Scotland with me," 
writes the expectant lover, after alluding to some an- 
cestral matters, "you will see their burying-place, now 
all that remains with my father of a very handsome 
property. It is one of the most beautiful and romantic 
scenes you ever saw, among the ruins of an old abbey. 
When I die, Charlotte, you must cause my bones to be

laid there; but we shall have many happy days before 
that, I hope." 

To this cheerful and timely request Miss Car- 
penter a lively young woman endowed with 
scant reverence for ancestral bones sensibly 
replied : 

" What an idea of yours was that to mention where 
you wish to have your bones laid ! If you were mar- 
ried I should think you were tired of me. A very 
pretty compliment before marriage ! I hope sincerely 
I shall not live to see that day. If you always have 
those cheerful thoughts, how very pleasant and gay 
you must be ! Adieu, my dearest friend. Take care 
of yourself if you love me, as I have no wish that you 
should visit that beautiful and romantic scene, the bury- 
ing place." 

One fancies that the lover must have derived 
chagrin and solace in about equal measure from 
this satirical epistle. 

Viewing the Letters as a whole, and seek- 
ing for their prevalent and distinctive note, we 
should say that it lay in a certain largeness 
and manliness of tone, and in an impersonal 
and ingenious way of viewing men and motives 
that is rare enough in the familiar letters of 
the brethren of the genus irritabile. There are 
many allusions to brother authors (a term that 
usually scarcely expresses the actual relation), 
but nowhere is there a hint of jealousy or de- 
traction not even at the period when the 
writer's own poetical star was unmistakably 
paling before that of Byron. For this declen- 
sion Sir Walter was certainly well indemnified 
by the magnificent success of his prose tales ; 
but the provocation, nevertheless, was sharp 
enough, and the rival was an especially vulner- 
able one. To those who know Scott at all it 
is scarcely necessary to sa} 7 that his letters have 
the prime epistolary merit of frankness ; not 
frankness of the morbid, self-dissecting sort, 
but the hearty outspokenness of the large- 
souled, cordial man, who invites the confidence 
of his friends, and gives them his own in re- 
turn. Scott's writings are always the whole- 
somest of reading. There is that in them that 
tones and braces the mind, as the breath of his 
own heath-clad hills and moors tones and braces 
the body ; but in nothing that he has written 
is this rare tonic quality so marked as in his 
admirable letters. What could be more thor- 
oughly sound and excellent, albeit in a somewhat 
homely way, than the following " Letter to a 
Schoolboy," written to a lad of fifteen who had 
sent the author of " Marmion " some speci- 
mens of his own versification : 

"... The friends who know me best, and to whose 
judgment I am myself in the constant habit of trusting, 
reckon me a very capricious and uncertain judge of po- 



etry; and I have had repeated occasion to observe that 
I have often failed in anticipating the reception of po- 
etry by the public. Above all, sir, I must warn you 
against suffering yourself to suppose that the power of 
enjoying natural beauty and poetical description are 
necessarily connected with that of producing poetry. 
The former is really a gift of Heaven, which conduces 
inestimably to the happiness of those who enjoy it. The 
second has much more of a knack in it than the pride 
of poets is always willing to admit; and, at any rate, is 
only valuable when combined with the first. ... I 
would also caution you against an enthusiasm which, 
while it argues an excellent disposition and a feeling 
heart, requires to be watched and restrained, though not 
repressed. It is apt, if too much indulged, to engender 
a fastidious contempt for the ordinary business of the 
world, and gradually to render us unfit for the exercise 
of the useful and domestic virtiies which depend greatly 
upon our not exalting our feelings above the temper of 
well-ordered and well-educated society. No good man 
can ever be happy when he is unfit for the career of 
simple and commonplace duty; and I need not add how 
many melancholy instances there are of extravagance 
and profligacy being resorted to under pretense of con- 
tempt for the common rules of life. Cultivate, then, 
sir, your taste for poetry and the belles-lettres, as an 
elegant and most interesting amusement; but combine 
it with studies of a more severe and solid cast, and such 
as are most intimately connected with your prospects in 
future life. In the wor.ds of Solomon, ' My son, get 
knowledge.' ..." 

The above letter is worth quoting, were it 
only as an index to a leading trait in the wri- 
ter's character his overflowing kindliness. 
Many tyros went to him for advice (which in 
such cases usually means for approval), and 
while some of them undoubtedly went away 
disappointed, no one certainly went away cha- 
grined or empty-handed. In the Abbotsford 
collection there are many letters from boys and 
young men seeking literary counsel, all of which 
Sir Walter appears to have replied to, and then 
folded carefully, writing name and date on the 
back of each. How many incipient Chatter- 
tons he thus turned from the squalid garrets 
of the Edinburgh Grub Street into the respect- 
able, if prosaic, paths of process-drawing and 
cheese-mongering, history tells not ; but the 
number may well have been considerable. 

We have spoken of Scott's letters touching 
his great rival and poetical successor, Byron ; 
and as this portion of his correspondence can- 
not fail to be of general interest we shall quote 
from it pretty freely. The first two cantos of 
" Childe Harold" appeared in February, 1812, 
and in the following May Scott wrote to Mr. 
Morritt : 

" I agree very much in what you say of ' Childe Har- 
old.' Though there is something provoking and insult- 
ing both to morality and to feeling in his misanthropical 
humor, it gives, nevertheless, an odd pungency to his 
descriptions and reflections, and upon the whole it is a 



386

[Dec. 16, 



poem of most extraordinary power, and may rank its 
author with our first poets. I see the ' Edinburgh Re- 
view' has hauled its wind, which I suppose is as much 
owing to Lord Byron's political conversion as to their 
conviction of his increasing powers." 

Writing to Lady Abercorn in January, 1813, 
Sir Walter goes on to say of " Childe Harold ": 
"You ask me how I like Lord Byron's poem, and I 
answer, very much. There is more original strength 
and force of thinking in it, as well as command of lan- 
guage and versification, than in almost any modern 
poem of the same length that I have happened to meet 
with. It is really a powerful poem, the more power- 
ful because it arrests the attention without the aid of 
narrative, and without the least apparent wish to con- 
ciliate the favor of the reader, but rather an affectation 
of the contrary. I say an affectation of the contrary, 
because I should be sorry to think that a young man of 
Lord Byron's powers should really and unaffectedly en- 
tertain and encourage a contempt for all sublunary com- 
forts and enjoyments. . . . This tinge of discontent, or 
perhaps one may almost say misanthropy, is the only 
objection I have to Lord B.'s very powerful and origi- 
nal work." 

There is an expression in the letter above 
that is very characteristic of the essential man- 
liness and candor of Scott's nature. To admit, 
as he did, that Byron's verse could dispense 
with "the aid of narrative," was to admit its 
poetical superiority to his own chansons de 
geste, in which the epic element was confess- 
edly the vital one. Between "Childe Harold," 
with its splendid power and energy, its pro- 
found passion and sustained melody, and his 
own "Marmion," with its ballad lilt and easy 
sentiment, there was obviously a difference not 
only of kind but of rank ; and Scott could ac- 
knowledge this the more readily in that he saw 
that where he himself was undeniably strong, 
his rival was lamentably weak. Scott is, all 
in all, the best of story-tellers ; it is not too 
much to say that Byron is one of the worst. 
No less sober and discerning than his appraisal 
of Byron's verse is his appraisal of his charac- 
ter. Scott saw in the fashionable bard neither 
a sublime and mysterious " Lara " an incar- 
nation of the sombre and misanthropic heroes 
he chose to portray on the one hand, nor, on 
the other, a mere attitudinizing coxcomb. The 
ultra class of Byron's admirers delighted to in- 
vest his career with something of the pseudo- 
grandeur of veiled and romantic crime ; clear- 
headed Sir Walter saw that mere vulgar vice, 
such as any sixpenny rake in Cheapside might 
indulge in, had been much more in his lord- 
ship's line and he was generous enough to 
deplore the fact, and to try to palliate it. His 
final word on Byron is expressed in a letter to 
Lady Abercorn, dated June 4, 1824 : 



"I have been terribly distressed at poor Byron's 
death. In talents he was unequalled, and his faults 
were those rather of a bizarre temper, arising from an 
eager and irritable nervous habit, than any depravity 
of disposition. He was devoid of selfishness, which I 
take to be the basest ingredient in the human disposi- 
tion. He was generous, humane, and noble-minded, 
when passion did not blind him. The worst I ever saw 
about him was that he rather liked indifferent com- 
pany, than that of those with whom he must from char- 
acter and talent have necessarily conversed more upon 
an equality. I believe much of his affected misanthropy 
(for I never thought it real) was founded upon in- 
stances of ingratitude and selfishness experienced at 
the hands of those from whom better could not have 
been expected. During the disagreement between him 
and his lady, the hubbub raised by the public reminded 
one of the mischievous boys who pretend to chase run- 
away horses, 

' And roar, Stop, stop them ! till they're hoarse ; 
But mean to drive them faster.' 

Man and wife will hardly make the mutual sacrifices 
which are necessary to make them friends, when the 
whole public of London are hallooing about them." 

Sir Walter's letters are naturally full of al- 
lusions to other contemporary authors, and we 
may allow ourselves one more extract an 
amusing note on Jeffrey, who comes in for 
pretty frequent mention, kindlier mention, in- 
deed, than that caustic critic deserved at the 
hands of the author of "Marmion." Writing 
to Miss Seward in 1806 Sir Walter says : 

" I think were you to know my little friend Jeffrey 
you would perhaps have some mercy on his criticisms; 
not but that he often makes his best friends lose pa- 
tience by that love of severity which drives justice into 
tyranny: but, in fact, I have often wondered that a man 
who loves and admires poetry so much as he does can 
permit himself the severe, or sometimes unjust, strict- 
ures which he fulminates even against the authors whom 
he most approves of, and whose works actually afford 
him most delight. But what shall we say ? Many 
good-natured country Tories (myself, for example) 
take great pleasure in coursing and fishing, without any 
impeachment to their amiabilities, and probably Jeffrey 
feels the same instinctive passion for hunting down the 
bards of the day. In common life the lion lies down 
with the lamb; for not to mention his friendship for 
me, now of some standing, he had the magnanimity (ab- 
solutely approaching to chivalrous reliance upon the 
faith of a foe) to trust himself to Southey's guidance in 
a boat on Winderinere, when it would have cost the

In closing, we may say of these volumes, that 
they form in every way a desirable supplement 
to the great work of Sir Walter's son-in-law. 
No one who values the one work can afford to 
leave the other unread. Indeed, we believe it 
may fairly be claimed for these Familiar Let- 
ters that they bring the reader a degree nearer 
the author of " Waverley" than either of their

MR. SPENCER ON THE PRINCIPLES OF 
BENEFICENCE. * 

There is a touch of pathos in the avowal with 
which Mr. Spencer introduces the last part of 
his Ethics, the conclusion of the great task to 
which the second half of his life has been con- 
secrated. Satisfaction in the achievement, he 
says, is somewhat dashed by disappointment at 
the meagreness of the ethical result. " The 
Doctrine of Evolution has not furnished guid- 
ance to the extent I had hoped." 

A successful life has been defined as a great 
thought conceived in youth and executed in ma- 
turity. But when the great thought assumes 
the form of a scheme of Universal Philosophy, 
the execution will inevitably fall short of the 
conception. The ambitious edifice will be 
structurally weak in places, and many of its 
chambers will be vacant or furnished only with 
casual or commonplace borrowings. Human 
thought, as Carlyle warns us, vainly strains to 
" swallow this universe," and where a hundred 
generations have failed the individual thinker 
will not succeed. Each man, now as in the 
days of Empedocles, really believes only in that 
on which he has chanced to alight ; and what- 
ever high-sounding titles he inscribes on the 
cover of his book, he can in the end tell us only 
of the little world of his own experience, exper- 
iment, and reading. 

Mr. Spencer conceived in his youth two great 
thoughts : his formula of an Evolution wide 
enough to include both astronomy and biology, 
and his conception (elaborated in the " Prin- 
ciples of Psychology") of life and mind as self- 
adjusting correspondence with the environment 
enforced by the death penalty. Even in his 
" Psychology " and " Sociology " these ambi- 
tious generalizations, though interpreted by in- 
genious analysis and illustrated by vast collec- 
tions of facts, failed to do justice to the infinite 
subtlety and diversity of nature. In ethics 
they are not merely inadequate, but positively 
misleading, owing to the distinctly anti-ethical 
associations that they necessarily convey to the 
majority of readers. The conception of life

ume II. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



and conduct as a gradual adjustment to the 
conditions of self-preservation is more harmful 
to sound ethical feeling than it can possibly be 
helpful to intellectual apprehension of the gen- 
eral conditions under which ethical and uneth- 
ical acts arise. The interpretation of our moral 
experience is not aided by such a formula as 
this : " And along with this greater elaboration 
of life produced by the pursuit of more numer- 
ous ends, there goes that increased duration of 
life which is the supreme end." Eather must 
we say with Plato : " To preserve himself such 
as he is, and to keep safe his possessions, is not 
the end and aim of the virtuous man. Sweet 
is this little life, but the true man will live well 
while he may; how long or short he will permit 
to heaven." It is idle to reply that the one 
sentence is a bit of fine sentiment, the other 
a formulation of a scientific law. The ethics 
of evolution, too, must recognize the danger 
of what George Eliot calls "the hard, bold 
scrutiny of imperfect thought into obligations 
which can never be proved to have any sanctity 
in the absence of feeling." The moralist who 
writes, " Death by starvation from inability to 
catch prey shows a falling short of conduct from 
its ideal," by his lack of humor and failure in 
literary tact encourages such imperfect thought 
far more than he can check it with all his 
science. 

A further cause of the inadequacy of Mr. 
Spencer's treatment of ethics is to be found in 
the nature and limitations of his studies. They 
have not been those that qualify a man to deal 
with ethical problems in a sympathetic and 
illuminating way. For that, the humanistic and 
historic culture which he neglects is indispen- 
sable. Lastly, nearly all that he now has to 
tell us has been anticipated. During the long 
years of the postponement in which the unfin- 
ished structure of the " Synthetic Philosophy " 
has stood before us awaiting its ethical coping- 
stone, the special workers in this domain have 
not been idle. It was not difficult for them to 
prolong the lines in imagination, and make 
fairly accurate forecast of the completed edifice. 
The supplementary qualifications which the 
ethics of Evolution adds to the old Epicurean 
ethics of the utilitarian and associationist school 
have all been foreseen, and the issues thus raised 
with the opposing intuitionalist school in its 
various forms have been repeatedly debated. 
The highest point yet reached in the discussion 
is marked by Mr. Leslie Stephen's " Science of 
Ethics " and by his recent thoughtful reply to 
Professor Huxley's brilliant but inconclusive

Romanes Lecture. One turns with relief from 
the languid prolixity of the master to the trench- 
ant vigor of the disciple. But comparisons 
between inventor and perfector are invidious. 
The volume before us treats of beneficence, 
and begins by defining anew, with ponderous 
dialectic, the too-often neglected line of demar- 
cation between beneficence and justice, between 
things which are to be accepted as benefactions 
and things which may be claimed as rights. 
Justice aims to secure to every man the good 
or evil that naturally flows from his own acts, 
so far as this is compatible with the mainten- 
ance of social life. A secondary law of the 
highest social life requires that strict measures 
of justice be supplemented by spontaneous good- 
will. But this quality of mercy cannot be 
strained, and its enforcement as a right wrongs 
the benefactor and weakens the moral fibre of 
the beneficiary. Beneficence is negative when 
it acts as a check on the unbridled use of our 
powers, positive when it prompts their active 
employment on behalf of others. With the aid 
of this somewhat artificial classification, Mr. 
Spencer propounds and discusses with ingenious 
naivete an immense number of special problems 
of casuistry. In business competition, for ex- 
ample, negative beneficence rebukes the conduct 
of " a man named Stewart " who lived in New 
York and acquired a colossal fortune by the 
practice of suddenly lowering his prices to an 
unremunerative rate, " seriously damaging nu- 
merous small traders." But it does not coun- 
tenance the claim of the trades-unions that only 
a " scab " will beat his fellows on a stint of 
work. Voluntary limitation of their field of 
activity by the successful lawyer or doctor pre- 
sents a more delicate problem ; for the welfare 
of society may require that the competent pro- 
fessional man should undertake all the work 
he can faithfully perform. Again, negative 
beneficence demands the voluntary relinquish- 
ments of the advantages of a hard contract, as 
it on the other side forbids the laborer's striking 
when there is a big job on. It would restrain 
the pernicious activity of the soft-hearted 
woman who gives pence to the organ-grinder 
who makes day hideous to her philosophic 
neighbor, and it prohibits overpay ing of cabbies, 
and the tipping of guards, porters, and waiters, 
in order to obtain better than the average ser- 
vice. It imposes flashes of silence on the bril- 
liant conversationalist, will not permit a tennis 
player to beat a father whose son is watching 
the game, or a keen reasoner to expose a man's 
fallacies " if his fiancee is present." It softens 



censure, though not to the extent of altogether 
suppressing anger, which is frequently a moral 
and salutary feeling. And it also checks the 
impulse to bestow excessive praise, especially 
if the recipient is "a handsome young lady 
accustomed to tribute in words and looks. . . . 
Shall you give her the pleasure she seeks by 
letting your glances be seen ? If you think 
only of proximate results, you may ; but not if 
you think also of remote results." 

The requirements of positive beneficence are 
elaborately discussed in relation to marriage, 
parenthood, kinship, aid to the helpless or sick, 
relief of the poor, etc. Mr. Spencer still cher- 
ishes his fine fear of excessive altruism, but 
otherwise has little to add to the judgments of 
common-sense in these complicated matters. 

.The chapters on social and political benefi- 
cence are less languid in tone, and reveal some- 
thing of the old fire of the Essays. " Benefi- 
cence tells no man to help in keeping up the 
movement of the social treadmill." " Life is 
vitiated," especially, it would appear, for the 
bachelor, " by making attractiveness of ap- 
pearance a primary end. Such is the expe- 
rience all through the day, from the first thing 
in the morning, when, while standing dripping 
wet, you have to separate the pretty fringes of 
the bath towel which are entangled with one 
another, to the last thing at night, when the 
boot-jack, which, not being an ornamental ob- 
ject, is put out of sight, has to be sought for." 
The silver butter-knife, we are told, is a typi- 
cal instance of a thing which has no raison 
d'etre save display. Pretentious funerals and 
wedding presents make life a burden. Man- 
kind waste their time in " buying or producing 
pretty things so-called, which are mostly in the 
way." 

We smile to see the philosopher in his old 
age renewing his youthful tilt against social 
wind-mills. But no American can afford to 
smile at the sermon preached by Mr. Spencer 
from the text, Eternal vigilance is the price of 
liberty and good government. Political benefi- 
cence condemns the false sentiment of partisan 
loyalty which constrains a man to vote for a 
pernicious bill in order to " put the other side 
in a hole." It will not hold guiltless the man 
of ability who withdraws himself from all con- 
cern in public affairs in order to make money 
or enjoy his leisure. Above all, the sense of 
public duty demands that we incur the odium of 
protesting against mismanagement and wrong- 
doing at all times and seasons, even where the 
immediate evil consequences cannot be dis-

cerned. Life is vitiated by just such trifles 
as the acceptance by a too complaisant inspec- 
tor of a bad road or an unsafe building, the 
passing by a gentlemanly examiner of a loose or 
inaccurate bank statement. " Most men assume 
that things are going right until it is proved 
that they are going wrong ; whereas the as- 
sumption should be that things are going wrong 
till it is proved that they are going right." 

In the final chapter a word is said of the 
inspiring dream of a society so constituted as to 
render superfluous these precise prescriptions 
of a transitional ethics. Mr. Spencer wisely 
admonishes the socialist dreamers that they can- 
not colonize their Altrurias with any breed of 
man now existing on this planet. But after 
aeons of Evolution, he foresees a humanity that 
may realize the visions of Plato and Shelley. 
This illusion will at least work no practical 
harm though perhaps here too the poet is 
wiser than the philosopher : 

" Far away beyond her myriad coming changes earth will be 
Something other than the wildest modern dream of you or me."

AN- AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGIST AXD 
HIS WORK.* 

We venture to predict that the time will 
soon come when there will be a widespread in- 
terest in America in the life and work of Mr. 
Adolphe Francois Bandelier, whose writings 
at present appear too rarely before the gen- 
eral reading public. As it is, a few meager 
details gathered up from a variety of sources, 
but chiefly from his own writings, may be in- 
teresting to our readers. 

His name (he writes it Ad. F. Bandelier; 
it appears on some of his books Adolf, on others 
Adolphe ; upon whose authority some one sup- 
plies the Francois, we do not know) implies 
that he is of French family. Our impression 
is, however, that he is a native of this country, 
and that he claims Illinois as his home. If not 
a native, he has at least been long enough a 
resident of this country to record in admirable 
English the scientific data gathered by him, 
and to set forth the results of his researches in 
a most fascinating style ; and he has so thor- 
oughly identified himself with ethnological and 
archaeological studies in this country as to jus- 
tify our claiming him for an American. 

Apparently his earliest contributions to his-

torical literature were reports to the Peabody 
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, " On 
the Art of War and Mode of Warfare of the 
Ancient Mexicans" (1877), "On the Distri- 
bution and Tenure of Lands and the Customs 
with respect to Inheritance among the Ancient 
Mexicans" (1878), and "On the Social Or- 
ganization and Mode of Government of the 
Ancient Mexicans " (1879). As the result of 
his researches among the Pueblo Indians, he 
submitted to the Archaeological Institute of 
America, in 1881, a "Historical Introduction 
to Studies among the Sedentary Indians of New 
Mexico " and a " Report upon the Ruins of the 
Pueblo of Pecos." The following year he sub- 
mitted to the same Institute his report of " An 
Archaeological Reconnoisance into Mexico, in 
the year 1881," which has since been published 
in a richly illustrated royal octavo volume of 
over three hundred pages, and has negatived the 
author's own modest opinion of the popularity 
of his work by going to a second edition and sell- 
ing at six dollars a volume. In 1885 he read an 
admirable paper before the New York Histor- 
ical Society on "The Romantic School an Amer- 
ican Archaeology," published in a pamphlet. 

He was the official historical investigator of 
the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological 
Expedition in 1887-88. During his residence 
in New Mexico he amassed and arranged a large 
collection of historical material relative to the 
aborigines and the Spanish occupancy of Amer- 
Eight years and more spent among the 



ica. 



Pueblo Indians resulted in " The Delight 
Makers," a romance of life among the aborig- 
inal Queres and Tehua Indians, published in 

1890, and reviewed in THE DIAL for August, 

1891. The publication of his previous works 
had been controlled by the various societies to 
which he had reported ; " The Delight Makers " 
was prefaced and seen through the press by the 
author. The latest result of his historical stu- 
dies, of which the public is to have the benefit, 
is published while the author is absent in Peru 
engaged on archaeological work. 

Mr. Bandelier has written for European peri- 
odicals and has met with a hearty recognition 
among the savants of Europe. We have heard 
of a " History of the Church in New Mexico " 
written by him for presentation to Pope Leo 
XIII., and that he has been engaged upon a 
comprehensive History of the Southwest. With 
an apparent genius for acquiring languages, and 
familiarity with the principal Indian dialects, 
and having access to documents of the greatest 
value and rarity, no person could be more thor-

oughly equipped for such a work, and we look 
forward to the appearance of this history with 
confidence that it will place its author in the 
front rank of American historians. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Bandelier now and then 
makes a valuable fragmentary contribution to 
our historical knowledge, as in " The Gilded 
Man." The desire to correct the errors of ear- 
lier historians seems to be the principal stimu- 
lus of his own painstaking labors. From the 
present work it may be learned that El Dorado 
is not "the golden land," as many suppose, but 
a contraction of El Hombre Dorado the 
gilded man. Although the basis of wildly ex- 
aggerated tales, El Hombre Dorado was an 
actual personage in aboriginal history, an In- 
dian chief in South America, whose body, in 
the course of a regularly recurring ceremonial, 
was covered with a resinous gum and then 
sprinkled with gold dust, which adhered until 
the chief bathed in a certain lake and thus 
completed the ceremonial. It was information 
of this that reached the European colonists of 
South America in the sixteenth century, excited 
their characteristic thirst for gold, and led to 
the disastrous expeditions in search of El Do- 
rado, narrated in the first four chapters of the 
book before us. 

The " Other Pictures of the Spanish Occu- 
pancy of America " consist of an account of 
similar will-o'-the-wisp expeditions in search 
of the Seven Cities of Cibola ; a carefully- 
digested account of the Massacre of Cholula 
(1519); a paper on "The Age of the City of 
Santa Fe "; and an account of one of the mur- 
derers of La Salle, Jean L'Archeveque, derived 
from ecclesiastical archives to which the author 
had access in the Indian pueblo of Santa Clara, 
New Mexico. The entire collection of papers 
reflects the conscientiousness with which the 
author conducts all his researches in a field 
which is peculiarly his own and in which he is 
justly entitled to be considered an expert.

WHITMANIANA.* 

" In Re Walt Whitman " is a curious me- 
lange of memorabilia, criticisms, and unpub- 
lished fragments, edited by the literary exec- 
utors of the poet, and designed to supplement 
Dr. Bucke's volume published several years 
ago. It contains some matter that is valuable,

utors, Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, Thomas 
B. Harned. Philadelphia : David McKay. 



much that is interesting, much also that is fool- 
ish, and a few things that are simply deplora- 
ble. No student of Whitman or of American 
literature can afford to dispense with it, for it 
is rich in biographical and critical material ; 
yet its general tone of indiscriminating eulogy 
operates many times to make the judicious 
grieve. Walt Whitman's figure is surely one 
of the most commanding in American litera- 
ture, yet its full stature will never be real- 
ized by the cultivated public at large, so long 
as the fanatical devotees of the poet's memory 
continue to lavish their extravagant encomiums 
upon his faults and his virtues alike. In the 
very forefront of this volume, we come upon 
the following extremely uncritical (as well as 
unliterary) comment : 

"Whitman had cosmic breadth and port. His ' Leaves ' 
foliage the heavens. He was so complicated with all 
men and all phenomena that his very voice partook of 
the sway of elemental integrity and candor. Nature 
has not shame nor vain glory, nor had he, and there 
was never a breath of distrust in his utterances from 
first to last. Absolutely candid, he was absolutely una- 
fraid. ' Leaves of Grass ' has a tone peculiarly its 
own and strange in all the annals of literary crea- 
tion. Whitman speaks in it as would heaven, making 
unalterable announcements, oracular of the mysteries 
and powers that pervade and guide all life, all death, 
all purpose." 

The volume contains a good deal of this sad 
and turgid stuff, and to that extent does posi- 
tive injury to the memory whose claims it ad- 
vocates. 

In the way of memorabilia, we are given 
some notes from conversations with Mr. George 
W. Whitman ; Dr. Bucke's remarks on " The 
Man Walt Whitman "; Mr. Sidney H. Morse's 
jottings on " My Summer with -Walt Whit- 
man " ; an account of the poet's last sickness 
and death, by Mr. Daniel LongakeF ; the " Last 
Days of Walt Whitman," by Mr. J. W. Wal- 
lace ; and a number of papers by Mr. Trau- 
bel, including the report of a " round table " 
symposium having Whitman for a central fig- 
ure, and an account of the poet's funeral. All 
this matter is of value, although it might prof- 
itably have been pruned of many trivialities. 
Mr. Morse's notes furnish an exceptionally in- 
teresting contribution to the study of the poet's 
intimate personality. 

Of Whitman's own prose work we are given 
a number of examples. There are three re- 
views of his poems, written by himself many 
years ago, but never before published over his 
signature. They inform their readers, with 
many a flourish, that we have " an American 
bard at last." They also proclaim that Amer-

ica is now to start an athletic and defiant lit- 
erature, that " the interior American republic 
shall also be declared free and independent " 
phrases which recall more recent pronuncia- 
mentos of the same sort, and which mean about 
as much as prospectuses of Keeley motors or 
programmes of new religions. Whitman's let- 
ters of 1873, written, when sick at Washing- 
ton, to his mother, are of far more value than 
the anonymous effusions above mentioned ; they 
afford a simple and unaffected revelation of the 
man himself, when unconcerned with what he 
conceived to be his mission. A few further 
fragments of Whitman's work are scattered 
through the volume, that called " Immortality " 
being the most important. 

Tributes to Whitman, critical and uncriti- 
cal, in prose and verse, occupy a considerable 
portion of the contents of this work. The 
terza rima poem on " Love and Death," by 
John Addington Symonds, is the most impor- 
tant piece of verse, and thus apostrophizes the 
poet to whom it is incribed : 

"Bard sublime, 

To whom the keys of mysteries are given, 
Throned in thine orb, fulfilling Space and Time, 
Noting the world's words with unerring ear ! 
How shall I dare in this ephemeral rhyme 
To tell what thou hast taught me, to unsphere 
The new-born star, thy planet, the desire 
Of nations faltering in a night of fear, 
More marvellous than Phosphor or the fire 
Of Hesperus love-lorn, not less divine 
Than that first splendor from the angelic choir 
Flashed on poor shepherd-folk in Palestine ? 
Thou dost establish and our hearts receive 
New laws of Love to link and intertwine 
Majestic peoples ; Love to weld and weave 
Comrade to comrade, man to bearded man, 
Whereby indissoluble hosts shall cleave 
Unto the primal truths republican." 

Mrs. Gilchrist's estimate of Whitman, pub- 
lished by Mr. W. M. Rossetti in 1869, is here 
reprinted, and was particularly deserving of 
preservation. There is an interesting but over- 
heated letter by W. D. O'Connor, apropos of 
the Harlan episode, now printed for the first 
time. Mr. R. G. Ingersoll's lecture on " Lib- 
erty in Literature," delivered for Whitman's 
benefit in 1890, is given entire. It is, of course, 
more rhetorical than critical, and its eloquence 
is not more than second-rate ; but it has the 
sympathetic quality in abundant measure, and 
constitutes one of the more important features 
of the volume. 

A still more important feature is provided 
by the groups of critical articles translated 
from other languages. They include contribu- 
tions from the French of M. Gabriel Sarrazin, 
the German of Herren Karl Knortz and T. W. 



Rolleston, and the Danish of Herr Rudolf 
Schmidt. These Continental tributes bring 
with them the broader outlook of criticism that 
assumes the world-standpoint, and naturally 
have much more to say about the poet's thought 
than about the poet's form. It is interesting 
to read M. Sarrazin's translations from Whit- 
man. The poet seems, if anything, to gain by 
translation, a fact which recalls Mr. Swin- 
burne's explanation of Byron's astonishing 
vogue upon the Continent. Even the magnifi- 
cent Lincoln monody (surely Whitman's high- 
water mark as mere poetical expression) reads 
well in the French version. 
" Non pour vous, non pour vous seal, 
Mais des fleurs et des branches vertes a tous les cercueils 

j'apporte, 

Car pour vous je veux chanter un chant frais comme le ma- 
tin, 6 mort saine et sacre'e, 
Partout des bouquets de roses, 
O mort, je vous couvre de roses et des premiers lis, 
Mais surtout a cette heure du lilas qui fleurit le premier, 
J'en apporte en abondance, je brise les branches des massifs, 
Les bras charge's j'arrive, et les re'pands pour vous, 
Pour vous et pour tous vos cercueils, 6 mort." 

Herr Rolleston makes a palpable hit when, 
speaking of the grossness beyond which many 
readers of Whitman refuse to let their vision 
take them, he says : " Indecent, in my opin- 
ion, these poems are not ; but the criticism 
which universally selects them for discussion 
and condemnation is extremely indecent." 

Mr. John Burroughs makes two contribu- 
tions to this collection. One, entitled " Walt 
Whitman and the Common People," is the 
briefest of sketches. The other, " Walt Whit- 
man and His Recent Critics," is based upon a 
collection of newspaper clippings made soon 
after the death of the poet. The comment is 
not without humor, as may be seen from the 
following bit : " The New York * Herald ' had 
said, ' He struck his lyre with his fist at times, 
instead of his finger-tips.' A Western editor 
hastened to say that was the best way to strike 
a liar." We regret to find in this article by 
Mr. Burroughs a passage so deplorable that it 
is simply amazing that he should have allowed 
it to be printed. The passage is this : 

" The British press has first and last had its spiteful 
flings at Whitman, one of the latest at least, that of 
Theodore Watts (whoever he be) in the ' Athenseum,' 
betraying an aggressive specimen of the dirty thick- 
witted cockney blackguard. A cur is never more a cur 
than when [the words that follow are not of a quotable 
character] ; and did cockney criticism ever appear more 
currish and contemptible than when in the person of this 
man Watts it made haste to defame and dishonor the 
memory of our poet ? " 

Upon the taste of these words there is no 
need to comment. Whatever the provocation,

or however obscure the critic, they would be 
indefensible. As for the suggestion implied by 
the phrase "whoever he be," it can only pro- 
voke a smile. The first of living English critics 
and one of the first of living English poets is 
not thus to be disposed of. Suppose, to take a 
fairly analogous case, that some English writer 
had taken umbrage at one of Lowell's essays. 
He would hardly have strengthened his case by 
speaking of " James Russell Lowell (whoever 
he be)." Leaving this unpleasant subject, let 
us hasten to say that Mr. Burroughs has written 
thoughtfully and well of Whitman's life and 
work: so well, indeed, that we cannot better 
end this review of an exti'emely heterogenous 
volume than by quoting the closing passage of 
his longer contribution. 

"The law of life of great poetry or great art is: he 
that would lose his life shall find it; he that gives him- 
self the most freely shall the most freely receive. Whit- 
man merged himself in the thought, in the love, of his 
country and of his fellows; he identified himself with 
all types and conditions of men; he literally made him- 
self the brother and equal of all. He thought of himself 
only as he thought of others in and through himself. la 
his life he was guilty of no self-seeking; he deliberately 
put by all that men usually strive for immediate suc- 
cess and applause, wealth, honors, family, friends that 
he might the more fully heed the voice from within. He 
chose the heroic part in his poetry and in his life."

effect which criticism has had on religious organi- 
zations ; the reduction of cohesive force in churches. 
The Parliament of Religions may be said to have 
been a tentative search, a plaintive cry, for more 
and wider unity. Are we departing from an or- 
ganic spiritual life, or drawing near it? 

We cannot answer this question till we see what 
is the true form and centre of unity. This centre 
is not to be found in any one church, in any organ- 
ization already achieved. The churches alike fall 
under existing criticism. The present separation of 
opinion has arisen under one wide protest against 
the various sects as a sufficient expression of the re- 
ligious life. We cannot, then, be called on to select 
any one of these detached masses as the centre of a 
new movement. They are all condemned, though 
not equally condemned, as adequate expressions of 
the Divine Mind. 

Yet, is there not at this very moment more spir- 
itual unity if we mean by unity not an outward 
form but an inward force among men than ever 
before? This unity is the unity of movement in 
one direction, under comprehensive and equivalent 
spiritual incentives, pushing all toward the truth. 
The divisive sectarian sentiments are simply the 
inertia offered to this impulse. 

A long, loosely-bound raft of logs threads its way 
slowly through the narrow and sinuous current of a 
sluggish stream. It readily coheres and quietly 
creeps on. At length a rapid is reached. The 
foremost logs are violently tossed and soon torn 
asunder. As each portion of the float approaches 
the centre of contention, it too dissolves away, till 
the river, far and near, is filled with single logs and 
single sections, all hurrying on under an energy each 
feels in a diverse degree. If unity means inward, 
adequate movement, then the unity is greater, not 
less, after than before the disruption. The unity 
of religious faith to-day is the unity of many men 
and many bodies of men responding in an unwonted 
degree to a truly divine energy that is hurrying 
them forward in the spiritual world. They are not 
yet ready to be bound up again in a single church, 
but when they shall coalesce it will be at a point far 
on toward the Kingdom of Heaven. 

Among the facts that indicate the rapidity of evo- 
lution in our time, hardly another is more startling 
than that so many books, charged to overflowing 
with one spiritual purpose, torching reverently and 
boldly the deepest facts in our religious life, should 
force themselves singly and in shoals on our atteu- 
| tion. Before me are a half-dozen volumes any one 
I of which would have been disturbing a score of years 
since. This is not less belief, it is more and deeper 
and wiser belief. 

"Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy," by Dr. Shedd, 
gives a milestone well back from which to measure 
our movement. Dr. Shedd was a professor at An- 
dover in my seminary life. He was a man of 
marked ability and of a very lovable character. 
But he then seemed to me, and has always seemed, 
one born out of due time, thoroughly belated in the 



18U3.J

spiritual world. He is a man to be gratefully ac- 
cepted, but a fact not easily to be expounded on the 
basis of rationalism. His latest volume is made up 
of comparatively short excerpts from promiscuous 
addresses and articles bearing on the spiritual out- 
look of our time as taken from the extreme height 
of orthodoxy. Professor Shedd's philosophy of re- 
ligious life is as simple and positive as that of the 
peasant who refers every difficulty directly to the 
devil. "There is nothing new in the orthodoxy of 
to-day ; and nothing new in the newest heterodoxy." 
It is hardly worth while to have lived so long for 
so little. The professor thinks the "infidelity" of 
to-day characterized by the " error, effrontery, and 
meanness" of infidelity in all previous periods. In 
spite of my life-long veneration for this truly noble 
man, I must think that an orthodoxy which shows 
itself so completely unable to understand its own 
times, to profit them or to be profited by them, 
thereby stands thoroughly condemned. The pro- 
fessor's earnest exhortation to courage, directed to 
the young men going forth from his instruction to 
encounter this unbelief, is such as might easily have 
come from a doughty old knight, who had not felt 
the sting of a bullet under his own corselet, urging 
novices in arms to meet boldly the new weapons. 

The second volume on our list, " Theology of the 
Old Testament," by Pastor Piepenbring, is a con- 
cise yet comprehensive work, presenting the gen- 
eral theory of interpretation which is associated with 
Kuenen. The book is especially valuable because 
it does its task so independently and directly. It 
discusses the three periods, Mosaism, Prophetism, 
and Levitism, and sustains the discussion through- 
out by a very full reference to Scripture. The 
reader is thus in a position easily to judge the 
roundness of the method and the force of the argu- 
ment. It is a very helpful book. 

"The Bible and its Theology," by Dr. G. Vance 
Smith, is a work that lies in general tendency in 
the same direction as the last, but is very different 
in method. It pertains to the New Testament more 
than to the Old Testament. It discusses especially 
the religion which is embodied in the life and words 
of Christ and in the uses of Scripture. It attaches 
little importance to current dogmatic opinion. " My 
one single and earnest wish in this volume has been 
to exhibit the teaching of the sacred books, on cer- 
tain great subjects of general interest, simply as I 
have found it." The author has very constantly 
in view some special point of controversy with Dr. 
Liddon and others. As the style is clear and in- 
cisive, this raising of special difficulties tends to 
make the book not less interesting and v not less in- 
fluential. He puts the unity of faith in this form : 
" Christianity, objectively considered, is Christ him- 
self the mind, life, character, and spirit of Christ." 
The work throughout rests on religious truths as 
addressed directly and independently to the reason 
of man. 

" The Bible : Its Origin, Growth, and Character," 
by the Rev. J. T. Sunderland, is a systematic and 



carefully complete presentation of the results of 
modern criticism, both in connection with the Old 
and the New Testament. Higher criticism, while 
still showing diversity of opinion in details, is becom- 
ing harmonious in its general view of the origin of 
the books of the Bible and of their authority. Our 
author gives us a concise and comprehensive pre- 
sentation of the sources of the several portions of 
Scripture, and discusses in full its authority and the 
service fulfilled by it. He gives the results of the 
last score of years of inquiry in the direction indi- 
cated by Wellhausen and Kuenen. He says, in his 
preface, that he has endeavored to bring to his task 
a candid, catholic, and reverent spirit. The book 
sustains this affirmation. It is accompanied with a 
full bibliography. 

" The New Bible and Its New Uses," by the Rev. 
J. H. Crooker, is a book lying in much the same 
direction as the previous one without aiming to be 
as comprehensive. It answers the problems, What 
the Bible is, What it claims for itself, and What 
are its real uses. The results reacheorare those of 
the higher criticism. The author is scholarly, clear- 
minded, and very much in earnest. Such men are 
not only not to be feared, they give the light and 
promise of our day. The work is pervaded by so 
earnest and intelligent a temper as to be thoroughly 
readable and stimulating. 

"Jesus and Modern Life," by the Rev. M. J. 
Savage, is a series of discourses on the teachings of 
Christ. The general outlook is again that of the 
higher criticism. The book has in style a swing and 
a positiveness that belong to a popular preacher. 
The results of criticism are stated and accepted in 
a somewhat absolute form. The temper of the au- 
thor is excellent, and the aim of the book is to lead 
us back to the real centre of our faith the words of 
Christ. He presents these teachings at a variety of 
points. In the discourse on what Jesus taught about 
prayer, we find an example of the kind of conflict 
that has sprung up in many minds between phys- 
ical and spiritual law. Our^author is unwilling to 
accept the extension of prayer into the physical 
world. The two worlds are thus made to lie apart 
from each other in an impenetrable way. This con- 
ception seems to me inadmissible. The two halves 
of the world must be bound in closer, not less close, 
interlock, as thought advances. 

"The Witness to Immortality," by the Rev. 
George A. Gordon, is an extended and meditative 
renewal of the sentiments and insights which issue 
in the belief in immortality. The work is not 
framed as an argument. The two great items of 
faith, the being of God and immortality, can never 
be reached with the full force that belongs to them 
by the formal processes of proof. The premises 
from which these beliefs arise and by which they 
are constantly renewed and deepened are too com- 
prehensive, too emotional, too much a matter of 
personal experience, to admit of adequate state- 
ment. It is the entire drift of thought, rather than 
any one line of thought, that carries the mind over to 



394

[Dec. 16, 



them. Appreciating this fact, our author seeks to 
renew, in a full and deliberate way, the feelings 
which issue in the belief in immortality. He pre- 
sents these sentiments in connection with the He- 
brew prophets, the poets, the philosophers, with St. 
Paul, and with Christ. The book is fitted pleasur- 
ably to restore and deepen impressions already pres- 
ent. 

"Natural Selection and Spiritual Freedom," by 
Joseph John Murphy, is a series of not very closely 
connected discussions which show throughout a clear 
rational temper, associated with very positive belief. 
The immediate occasion of the work is found in the 
volume of Professor Drummond, " Natural Law in 
the'Spiritual World." The wide practical power of 
the author has given that book an influence that 
does not belong to it. In itself it is an unsuccess- 
ful combination of scientific notions and orthodox 
dogmas. There is no luminous coherence in it as a 
system of belief. This opening criticism leads Mr. 
Murphy to 3, wide discussion of the relation be- 
tween the physical and the spiritual worlds ; of the 
character of the analogies which lie between them 
and in each of them ; of natural selection in the 
spiritual world ; of future punishment and of moral 
freedom. These points are handled sagaciously by 
one whose mind responds directly to current reli- 
gious belief, to science, and to philosophy. The line 
of thought is thus vigorous and suggestive. 

The volume entitled "The Spiritual Life" is 
composed of six essays by as many different authors. 
Each treats of some portion of the history of the 
church in connection with mysticism. The recent 
devotional literature of England and of America 
constitute each a distinct part of the work. In this 
country, Channing and Emerson and Whittier are 
accepted as leaders of that devout tendency which 
subordinates dogmas and rites to the inner expe- 
riences of faith. The mysticism discussed is sim- 
ply the predominance of the personal spiritual life 
over all its adjuncts. Mr. George Willis Cooke says 
of Emerson : " His temper is devout ; his habitual 
thought is spiritual ; his aim is ever toward holy 
living." The sketches are chiefly historical, but 
are also free in quotation. The indomitable belief 
implied in mysticism, asserting itself in the face of 
all destructive criticism, is a fact in the history of 
religion of which we are too little cognizant. Be- 
lief seems, at times, crumbling away before the 
manifold attacks to which it is subjected ; but here 
is a faith, and that of superior minds, which is un- 
touched by all assaults. Inscriptions here and there 
on a great monument may suffer some effacement, 
while the monument itself remains unmoved by the 
erosions of time. Such interior, invincible thoughts 
does mysticism disclose as belonging to our faith. 

"Aspects of Theism," by Dr. William Knight, is 
a vigorous rendering of an old theme. It is hardly 
worth while for one to re-state the argument for 
theism, unless he is possessed of a sound philosophy, 
a thorough comprehension of scientific methods, 
and a penetrating insight into the spiritual purposes 



that are now subserved by a belief in the being of 
God. Yet it is desirable that this argument should 
often be gone over. A new statement, in any meas- 
ure adequate, is sure to gather up some fresh im- 
pressions, and lead us, in our estimates of the nature 
and character of God, to a little different goal. Our 
conceptions of the nature of the Divine Being must 
be the fruit of many personal elements, must sweep 
in very varied experiences, and be for each mind, 
in a high degree, its own solution of last questions. 
It is not wise to expect that those who have faith 
should travel quite the same paths, or reach identi- 
cal conclusions, in theism. The discussion in the 
present volume is wide and penetrative, it encoun- 
ters the real difficulties of belief, and so will help 
many and give adequate guidance to a few. The 
work is especially full in its treatment of the per- 
sonality of God. " There exists within the universe, 
as its latent essence, pervading it in all its phenom- 
enal life, a Principle which is also a Force unfold- 
ing itself through law, a Power which reveals itself 
in life, and a Character which assumes a vast vari- 
ety of phases all of which are equally true and 
beautiful and good" (p. 155). The author accepts 
an intuition of God a doctrine not easily conceded. 
" It may be most fitly described as a direct gaze, 
by the inner eye of the spirit, into a region over 
which mists usually brood. The great and trans- 
cendent Reality, which it apprehends, lies evermore 
behind the veil of phenomena " (p. 119). What 
can an intuition of this order give which is not phe- 
nomenal? If it be phenomenal, what can the phe- 
nomena be? If it be a conception, why is not that 
conception simply a rational product in view of just- 
ifying data? 

" Biblical Essays," by Bishop Lightfoot, is made 
up of discussions, a few of which have appeared in 
periodicals, but most of which are put together from 
notes of lectures given at Cambridge. The subjects 
are the authority of St. John's gospel, Paul's pre- 
paration for the ministry, the chronology of St. 
Paul's life and epistles, the churches of Macedonia, 
the church of Thessalonica, the Mission of Titus to 
the Corinthians, the structure and distination of the 
epistle to the Romans, the distination of the epistle 
to the Ephesians, the date of the pastoral epistles, 
Paul's history after the close of the Acts. The dis- 
cussions are characterized by a full, candid, and 
adequate treatment. Bishop Lightfoot was con- 
servative in his tendency, but in no way disposed 
to belittle objections, evade them, or bear them 
down. One finds in a work of this sort the very 
grave satisfaction of feeling that our current histor- 
ical convictions are by no means so accidental and 
ill-grounded as the facile criticism of a few bold 
minds is wont to imply. A good deal of criticism 
virtually destroys itself by the ease with which it 
sets aside accepted opinions, and transforms the his- 
torical field into a region of loose conjecture. This 
volume can be heartily recommended as combining, 
in a high degree, a cautious temper with liberal 
scholarship. JOHN BASCOM.

Messrs. Doclcl, Mead & Co.'s handsome edition 
of Maxime de la Rocheterie's " Life of Marie An- 
toinette " (well translated by Cora Hamilton Bell) 
should prove one of the most popular publications 
of the season. M. de la Rocheterie's book is a mas- 
terpiece in its way a rare combination of brilliant, 
warmly - sympathetic portrayal, with candid and 
impartial criticism. The book is not for one mo- 
ment to be confounded with the mass of flimsy and 
deleterious trash which has been written concerning 
this period of French history. Marie Antoinette 
has suffered about equally from unmerited praise 
and unmerited aspersion. Her critics have painted 
her as angel or as demon, according to their own 
bias. It has remained for M. de la Rocheterie to 
paint her as woman ; and, happily, he has not for- 
gotten that absolute truth of portraiture is perfectly 
compatible with the graceful brush and the brilliant 
setting. Nowhere else, in short, is this sad episode 
in a chapter at once the brightest and the darkest 
in the world's history brightest as to its benign 
ideals, 'and darkest as to its means and methods 
so fascinatingly and so impartially told. The wri- 
ter's present estimate of this heroine does not dif- 
fer from that formerly expresssdin reviewing "The 
Correspondence of the Comte de Mercy with Maria 
Theresa ": " Marie Antoinette was not a sinner, 
neither was she a saint. She was a pure and charm- 
ing woman, somewhat heedless and frivolous, but 
always chaste ; a queen somewhat too hot-headed 
in the patronage she bestowed, and inconsiderate in 
her political actions, but proud and energetic ; a 
true queen, by reason of the dignity of her bearing 
and the splendor of her majesty ; a true woman, in 
virtue of the seductiveness of her manners and the 
tenderness of her heart, till she became a martyr, 
through the extremity of her trials and her trium- 
phant death." The material features of the book 
also call for commendation. Print and paper are 
good, the twenty portraits are acceptably done, and 
the cover is quiet and tasteful. There is also a 
sumptuous large-paper edition. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. issue a spick and 
span new edition of that old-time favorite and rol- 
licking picture of English University life forty years 
back, "The Adventures of Verdant Green," by 
Cuthbert Bede. The book was vastly popular in 
its day (over 150,000 copies have been sold), and 
we are a little curious to learn how it will strike the 
present public. If one is to implicitly believe the 
author (which we doubt), Oxford life at the period 
treated was a wild hurly-burly of carousing, hazing, 
cricketing, boating, steeple-chasing, rat-baiting, 
town-and-gown rows, etc., with a very mild season- 
ing of the classics thrown in, while the Oxford under- 
graduate was a sorry (if amusing) scamp, usually 
of the type of Lever's " Frank Webber" or Thack- 
eray's "Foker." Some of Bede's characters are 
almost classic, in their small way, as " Mr. Boun- 



cer," "Gig-lamps" himself, "Mr. Blades," "Four- 
in-hand Fosbrooke," and last but not least "the 
Putney Pet" Who that has read it (as a boy) can 
forget Bede's epic description of the great town-and- 
gown battle, and the prodigies of valor performed 
therein by this battered hero of the " P. R."- 
deeds not unworthy of Diomede and Ajax Telamon ! 
Recalling them, one is almost inclined to agree with 
Mr. Besant that " The decay of boxing during the 
last twenty-five years has been certainly followed by 
a great decay of the national pluck and pugnacity, 
and therefore, naturally, by a decay of national en- 
terprise." Therefore exclaims Mr. Besant, fired 
by memories of the palmy days of Spring and 
Broughton, of "Tom"Sayers and "Jem" Belcher 
"the bravest of the brave" "let all our boys be 
taught to fight ! let there be no nonsense listened 
to about brutality. The world belongs to the men 
who can fight." We fancy we hear a pavid chorus 
of maternal dissent from this eminently Anglo- 
Saxon monition ; but the monitor is more than half 
right. The boy who " takes the wall " at school is 
usually father of the man who keeps it through life. 
The new edition of the " Verdant Green " books is 
a very attractive one, with its bright, clear print, 
showy bindings of green and gold, and with all the 
original mirth-provoking illustrations. 

" Inigo Jones and Wren ; or, The Rise and De- 
cline of Modern Architecture in England" (Mac- 
millan), a handsomely-appointed quarto, by Mr. W. 
J. Loftie, is written, says the author, not for archi- 
tects, but in the earnest hope that it may reach some 
of those by whom architects are employed. Our 
examination of the book, however, leads us to think 
the professional architect will find both text and 
illustrations of very considerable interest, despite 
the fact that Mr. Loftie has avoided the pedantry 
of talking obscurely and learnedly about triglyphs, 
drops, modillions, architraves, entablatures, etc., in 
a work meant to be intelligible to the lay reader. 
As the title implies, the work treats of the style of 
architecture practiced by Jones and Wren ; and to 
this kind the author applies the term "Palladian," 
which he prefers to the only other possible word 
"renascence or renaissance," as being more defi- 
nite. The influence of the style, Mr. Loftie thinks, 
was nowhere more marked than in England, where 
it was adopted (chiefly through the publication in 
1570 of Palladio's book) as representing classical 
or learned, as distinguished from Gothic, art. The 
book is agreeably and intelligently written, present- 
ing matter that is of great interest to the profes- 
sional reader in a style not beyond the capacity of 
ordinarily well-read mortals. A feature of the work 
is the illustrations. These are mainly from cuts 
published during the golden age of English Palla- 
dian ; but there are many fine photographic views, 
especially of the beautiful buildings of the transi- 
tional period found in the western counties, where 
the Bath stone furnishes a relatively plastic vehicle 
for the expression of sentiment in building.

assure us that " Scott has gone out of fashion." A 
great many good things have gone out of fashion 
(and it is no less cheerful than wonderful to note 
how surely and overpoweringly they come in again), 
but the dictum about Scott does not seem to be well 
founded. It is not borne out, certainly, by the ap- 
pearance of Messrs. Estes & Lauriat's fine new 
Holiday edition (in two volumes) of "Ivanhoe," 
a copy of which is now before us. The book is 
soberly yet richly bound, and it contains twenty full- 
page illustrations, handsomely printed on light vel- 
lum paper. These are about equally divided in sub- 
ject between illustrative plates proper, representing 
scenes and characters of the story, and photographic 
views of "Ivanhoe" scenery the latter class being, 
in our judgment, the more successful. The editor 
is, of course (why say it?) the omnipresent and pro- 
tean Andrew Lang; and this recalls an unknown 
poet's recent plaint that 

" Over every mortal thing 's 
The spoor of Andrew Lang." 

Even this angry bard must, however, admit the 
modest way in which his enemy has here performed 
what Macaulay calls " the humblest of literary of- 
fices." He has furnished, it is true, an Introduction 
of some sixteen pages ; but he sticks to his book 
and his author, and is phenomenally forgetful 
throughout of Mr. Lang. He tells how " Ivanhoe " 
was written, discusses the story in some detail, an- 
swers pedantic objections to its historical and archa3- 
ological slips, and presents, in closing, some inter- 
esting extracts from contemporary reviews. To Mr. 
Ruskin's talk of the "nonsense of 'Ivanhoe,' the in- 
credibly opportune appearances of Locksley, the 
death of Ulrica, the resuscitation of Athelstane, as 
partly boyish, partly feverish," Mr. Lang rather 
feebly replies, "Perhaps Mr. Ruskin was never a 
boy"; which answer is a pretty fair case of Ignor- 
atio elenchi. Sir Walter himself admitted that the 
Athelstane resurrection was " a botch." To our 
thinking, a critical Introduction which deals with 
and therefore suggests to the mind of the reader all 
sorts of pettifogging objections is not just the best 
appetizer for a romance like "Ivanhoe." One should 
go to such books fresh and unsophisticated, ready 
and anxious to be deluded and befogged to any ex- 
tent; but Mr. Lang had his task assigned him, and 
he has done it precisely as it should be done. 

The English tourist has always contributed freely 
to the gayety of continental nations, but the author 
of " Across France in a Caravan " (Randolph) seems 
to have rather outdone his predecessors in liberality. 
The book embodies the story of a trip, a la Mrs. Jar- 
ley, from Bordeaux across France and the Riviera 
in one of those lumbering four-wheeled vehicles, 
half house, half wagon, affected by Gipsy tinkers 
and peripatetic photographers. This " caravan " 
had been named by her former owner (a man of 
strong fancy) the " Hirondelle." But as the " Hi- 
rondelle " weighed over two tons, and had never 
in her speediest swallow-flights been known to make 



over two miles an hour, her new owner concluded 
to re-christen her the " Escargot." The crew of 
the "Escargot " consisted at the start of the author, 
his patient and Jong-suffering wife, and a collie dog 
Avhich seems to have enacted the role of an uncom- 
monly captious first-cabin passenger. Essentially, 
the narrative is the " Escargot's " log. The story 
is amusingly told, and the little party made so light 
of their mishaps and so much of their windfalls, and 
had, on the whole, such a jolly, wholesome, happy- 
go-lucky, novel sort of time of it that the reader 
feels half inclined, on closing the book, to eschew 
Pullman cars for the future, and to take to the " car- 
avan" himself. The author's account of a French 
sportsman is diverting : " Just before we reached 
Finhan we met a gentleman attired in all his glory 
of hunting-cap, velvet coat, top-boots, French horn, 
network gamebag, and gun, and enough dogs to 
make up a respectable pack of beagles, which they 
very strongly resembled. AVe were wondering what 
he could have come out to shoot. To our minds it 
couldn't be anything less than a wild boar, but he 
very soon satisfied our doubts by suddenly turning 
aside off the road, throwing himself onto one knee 
with his gun at the present, and, after taking delib- 
erate aim of quite two minutes, blazing away into a 
flock of sparrows who were feeding on the ground." 
The volume is gotten up in approved Christmas 
style, and the illustrations, after sketches by the au- 
thor, add much to the humor of the text. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons reprint in attrac- 
tive style Julia Kavanagh's " Woman in France 
during the Eighteenth Century" a work which at 
least attests its author's copious reading. Unhap- 
pily, Mrs. Kavanagh starts out with what may be 
called the vindicatory tone. She proposes to vindi- 
cate the claim of her sex to having exercised some 
influence on French affairs in the eighteenth cent- 
ury or, to put it another way, to having been then, 
and a fortiori now, an integral and efficient part of 
the human race. The proposition does not seem, 
on the whole, a difficult one ; and we are always at 
a loss, when we hear it advanced, to know when or 
by whom it was ever controverted. Man, we know 
on episcopal authority, "is vile." Besides, he is 
notoriously prejudiced against a sex to which his 
mother and sisters belong, and from which he must 
perforce choose his wife. But we doubt if he is 
unreasonable enough to deny that woman has been, 
time out of mind, a potential factor in the progress 
and the propagation of the human race. We get a 
little weary sometimes of this gratuitous clatter 
over the question as to the comparative efficiency 
of the sexes. Why not argue, by way of a change, 
as to which blade of a pair of scissors does the more 
cutting? Mrs. Kavanagh's work is superficial, but 
it is chatty and anecdotal enough, and the portraits 
on steel and other embellishments bestowed upon 
it by the publishers make it an alluring gift-book. 

Outwardly similar to the work just noticed is the 
Messrs. Putnams' new two-volume edition of Fran-

ces Elliot's lengthy historical romance, " Old Court 
Life in France." The tale is laid in the sixteenth 
century, and the author has aimed, as she says, to 
work into her dialogue "each word and sentence 
recorded of the individual, every available trait of 
character to be found in contemporary memoirs, 
every tradition that has come down to us." Ob- 
viously, such a method does not admit of much play 
of imagination, and is eminently conducive to scrap- 
piness. As a historical picture the story is of some 
interest, and it forms an excellent basis for the 
many and interesting illustrations, mostly portraits, 
contained in the present edition. These have been 
reprinted from the plates in Miss Pardoe's " Me- 
moirs of the French Court." 

Very neat and serviceable is Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co.'s compact edition, in two volumes, of the 
"Journal of Eugenie de Gudrin." To speak of 
Mdlle. de Gudrin is to recall Matthew Arnold, who, 
in praising her, quite forgot what Mr. Lowell called 
his "jury-addressing manner," and warmed into 
something like Mr. Lowell's own munificence. Eu- 
ge"nie de Gue'rin, says Mr. Arnold, was " the most 
devoted of sisters, one of the rarest and most beau- 
tiful of souls. . . . Her soul had the same charac- 
teristic quality as her brother's talent distinction. 
Of this quality the world is impatient ; it chafes 
against it, rails at it, insults it, hates it ; it ends 
by receiving its influence, and by undergoing its 
law. . . . To the circle of spirits marked by this 
rare quality, Maurice and Euge*nie de Gue'rin be- 
long ; they will take their place in the sky which 
these inhabit, and shine close to one another, lucida 
sidera." Mr. Arnold's estimate of Mdlle. de Gue'rin 
was doubtless warmed and heightened by his inter- 
est in her touching story. The " Journal " (written 
for her brother's eye alone) remains, however, one 
of the few examples in literature of frank self-dis- 
closure ; and as such, if for no other quality, it de- 
serves to live. 

Mrs. Alfred Gatty's " Parables from Nature " 
are issued in two rather pleasing volumes by Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. Mrs. Gatty's productions will 
doubtless always find readers ; but we confess to 
some doubt as to the precise class of them she means 
to address whether adults or children. The teach- 
ing of the "Parables " seems a little too elementary 
for " grown-ups," while the language in which it is 
couched must baffle the intellectuals of any child 
short of an infant phenomenon. The text is well 
printed on lightly-glazed paper, and M. de Long- 
pr^'s drawings are so graceful and pleasing as to 
make one wish there were more of them. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s neat and inexpen- 
sive edition of "The Abbs' Constantin" (Handy- 
Volume Classics) bids fair to score " a palpable hit." 
It is nicely printed and bound, and contains a great 
number of text illustrations, in half-tone, by Made- 
leine Lemaire, with a frontispiece and ornamental 
title-page in photogravure. Those who already have 
M. HaleVy's classic tale in the large and sumptuous 



editions, which are meant to be looked at, will be 
glad to find it in this pretty and portable volume, 
which is meant to be read. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons add to their excel- 
lent series of Representative Novels Frederika Bre- 
mer's "The Home; or, Life in Sweden," in Mary 
Howitt's standard translation. The work is in two 
shapely 16mo volumes, and the good paper, bright 
new type, and neat exterior should assist materially 
in rehabilitating this prime favorite of near half a 
century ago. 

A seasonable gift-book and an approved compila- 
tion is Mr. Louis K. Harlow's " The World's Best 
Hymns " (Little, Brown, & Co.). Mr. Harlow also 
furnishes the illustrations a number of pretty 
landscape sketches, in which he has aimed to reflect 
the mood and sentiment of the accompanying verses. 
The collection is a book of hymns, rather than a 
hymn-book ; and Mr. Harlow has tried to include 
in it " the best English lyrical poetry that has been 
immediately associated with sacred music, and hal- 
lowed by long and constant use in the service of 
song in the home and the church." Few of the old 
favorites will be missed, and hymns by Longfellow, 
Whittier, Holmes, and Mrs. Stowe are included, by 
permission of the publishers. The black-letter titles 
and rubricated initials have a good decorative effect. 

The small quarto volume entitled " Pictures from 
Nature and Life " (McClurg) contains a collection 
of poems by Kate Raworth Holmes, copiously illus- 
trated by Helen E. Stevenson. The illustrations to 
the opening poem, which describes a day's outing 
in " Merrie England," are apt and effective, with 
one unfortunate exception. The final plate, repre- 
senting an everyday young man posing for his por- 
trait in a sack coat and an exasperatingly senti- 
mental attitude, coming as it does after the dreamy 
bits of English landscape, views of hallowed histor- 
ical sites and memorials, etc., savors a little of pic- 
torial bathos. Perhaps the young man meets the 
exigencies of the text; but we think he could be 
spared. Notably graceful and natural are the sprays 
and nosegays of leaves and blossoms strewn through- 
out the pages. 

The ever-popular "Lucille" makes its periodical 
appearance, this time in imperial 8vo, and resplend- 
ent in a cover of white vellum-cloth decorated with 
rich tracery and medallions in gilt, red, and blue. 
(Estes). The text is largely and clearly printed 
on rather thick paper, and there are a goodly num- 
ber of illustrations, partly illustrative drawings, and 
partly photographic views of scenery, works of art. 
etc., touched upon in or suggested by the text. The 
volume is showy without being tawdry, and it should 
attract attention. 

Mr. William Trumbull's romantic poem. "The 
Legend of the White Canoe" (Putnam), profusely 
illustrated in photogravure from the designs of F. 
V. Du Mond, forms a sufficiently striking presenta- 
tion volume. The poem is based on the tradition 
touching an old custom of the Indian tribes of

[Dec. 16, 



Western New York to assemble on certain occasions 
at Niagara and offer sacrifice to the Spirit of the 
Falls. "The sacrifice," explains Mr. Trumbull, 
" consisted of a white birch-bark canoe, which was 
sent over the terrible cliff, filled with ripe fruits and 
blooming flowers, and bearing the fairest girl in the 
tribe who had just attained the age of womanhood." 
We may add that in the poem which ensues mat- 
ters are reversed, and it is the girl, not the canoe, 
that plays the leading role. Mr. Trumbull' s verse 
is rather above the average of its class, and as much 
may be said of Mr. Du Mond's drawings. 

In the middle of the last century the King's Li- 
brary at London had sixty-three editions of Thomas 
i, Kempis's " The Imitation of Christ," including 
translations into eight languages. The number of 
editions has increased considerably since then ; and 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. now add their quota 
in the shape of a dainty 18mo that should prove a 
delight to pious souls. It is illustrated with fifteen 
drawings depicting scenes in the life of Christ, by 
H. Hofman, Director of the Royal Academy of 
Arts at Dresden. 

"Helpful Words " (Roberts) is the truthful and 
sufficiently explanatory title of a sheaf of monitory 
passages from the writings of Edward Everett Hale. 
They are compiled by Mary B. Merrill; and each 
extract is faced by a drawing by F. T. Merrill, 
whose designs, though slight, are apt and pleasing. 
The little booklet is prettily bound in white and 
gold. 

" Christmas Carols " (Thomas Whittaker), a 
comely booklet suggestive of old-fashioned Christ- 
mas cheer and observances, contains the words of 
the three fine carols, "In the field with their flocks 
abiding," "In sorrow and in want," and "All jubi- 
lant with psalm and hymn" each with two photo- 
gravure plates of the Madonna and Child, after well- 
known originals. The Carols are printed by per- 
mission of Canon Farrar, who will doubtless be 
pleased to see them so satisfactorily mounted. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. issue a new edition of 
" Picciola," in form generally similar to their "Co- 
lette " and " An Attic Philosopher " of the past 
two seasons. Since M. "Saintine" (or rather M. 
Joseph Xavier Boniface) won, in 1837, the Mon- 
tyon prize of 3,000 fr. for his pretty and touching 
tale it has gone on reproducing itself, so to speak, 
at a marvellous rate. In 1861 it reached a thirty- 
seventh edition ; and since then there have been 
probably half a score more. One has only to read 
"Picciola" to learn the secret of its surprising vi- 
tality. The publishers have made, in some res- 
pects, a pretty volume; but candor compels us to 
say that J. F. Gueldry's drawings are sad produc- 
tions. 

Emerson observed of Bryant that he has so con- 
trived to levy on all American nature that there is 
no feature of day or night in the country which 
does not, to a contemplative mind, recall his name. 
This is certainly putting the case pretty strongly 



though we fancy, indeed, that there are at least 
few people upon whom the sight of the fringed 
gentian or of a waterfowl does not have the effect 
indicated. Bryant loved nature and painted her 
accurately, as many of the selections in Appleton & 
Co.'s " Poems of Nature, by William Cullen Bry- 
ant" attest. The volume is of the ornate class, and 
it is profusely illustrated by Paul de Longpre". 
Some of M. de Longpre"s drawings, as the sheaf of 
golden-rod on page 45 and the dainty vignette to 
"Robert of Lincoln" on page 88, are pretty and 
graceful ; but there is a tendency to over-elabora- 
tion which in work of the kind always means 
stiffness. M. de Longpr^'s slighter drawings are 
invariably the happier. As a collection, the volume 
is an excellent one. There are forty-five poems in 
all, beginning with the fine lines " To a Waterfowl " 
and ending with "Our Fellow- Worshippers." 

One of the daintiest of Holiday souvenirs is a 
reprint of Austin Dobson's " Proverbs in Porcelain," 
from the press of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, 
with twenty-four illustrations and ornamental vig- 
nettes by Bernard Partridge. The " Proverbs " 
were first published in 1877, and to them is now 
added the " dramatic vignettes " "Au Hevoir," from 
" At the Sign of the Lyre." The quality of Mr. 
Dobson's airy little studies is already known to our 
readers, and it only remains for us to commend 
Mr. Partridge's extremely clever and vigorous draw- 
ings a thought too vigorous, perhaps, for their del- 
icate setting. 

The intrinsic merit and fair exterior of the new 
and modified edition of Redgrave's standard "A 
Century of Painters of the English School" (im- 
ported by Scribners), combine to make it a desira- 
ble gift-book. The work was first issued in 1865 ; 
and in preparing the present edition some abridge- 
ments have been made with a view of making it a 
more suitable and convenient manual for art stu- 
dents and amateurs. The merits of Mr. Redgrave's 
book, and his own exceptional qualification as a 
historian of British art are too well established to 
need comment. There are a number of wood-cuts 
of varying merit ; and the futile strivings of British 
art in the direction of " the Grand Style " are strik- 
ingly exemplified by the plates after Northcote and 
Haydon and, we regret to add, Reynolds. Why 
the gracious Sir Joshua, the painter, par excellence, 
of England's charming women and children, should 
be represented in a history of English painting by 
his vapid and ww-representative " Head of a Ban- 
ished Lord " passeth understanding. Gainsborough 
fares better. His "The Cottage Door" forms a 
lovely frontispiece. 

The following, much to our regret, reached us 
too late for anything beyond an enumeration in the 
present category : " Rembrandt, his Life, his Work, 
and his Time," from the French of Emile Michel, 
by Florence Simmonds, published by Messrs. Scrib- 
ner's Sons ; Frederick D. Thompson's " In the Track 
of the Sun" (Appleton) ; Edwin A. Barber's "Pot-

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

ii. 



" My Dark Companions and their Strange Stories " 
(Scribner) is from no less famous a pen than that of 
Henry M. Stanley. The hook is a collection of legends 
and folk-tales related at different times by the dark 
companions of his travels, as they sat about the camp- 
fire after a long day's march. The stories possess a kind 
of primeval freshness and originality. They are often 
picturesque, sometimes weird, occasionally humorous. 
The first legend, which gives an account of the creation 
of man, offers a very ingenious explanation of the pres- 
ence of sin in the world. When the earth lay awaiting 
the coming of life, its sole inhabitant was a great ugly 
toad. The moon and the toad each wished to have the 
honor of creating man. The toad accomplished his pur- 
pose first, producing an ugly, ill-formed, degraded crea- 
ture; and when the work was finished, the toad died. 
The moon did all she could to repair the error by re- 
moulding the creature, and succeeded in giving him a 
fairer form and a more enlightened mind ; but do what 
she would, there was left in his soul the stain from the 
hand of his creator. Such stories render the book 
scarcely less interesting to the folk-lore enthusiast than 
to the children for whom it is primarily intended. 

"Westward with Columbus" (Scribner) is still an- 
other tribute to the greatness of the Genoese explorer, 
in which the author, Mr. Gordon Stables, R. N., seeks 
to present in story form a rather detailed account of the 
life of the great mariner from the beginning to the close. 
The work is done in an appreciative way, with a manifest 
reverence for the greatness of the hero, and an unmis- 
takable ring of earnestness about it. It is, however, to 
be regretted that what is in many respects a charming 
book should be marred by the occasional use of a forced 
and stilted style. The mechanical neatness of the vol- 
ume is to be commended, and the illustrations by Mr. 
Alfred Pease are good. 

Mrs. Molly Elliot Seawell has, in her book entitled 
" Paul Jones " (Appleton), entered a field which is com- 
paratively new to this form of tillage. The work is avow- 
edly a romance, but the figure of our gallant first Commo- 
dore is one that readily lends itself to fiction, the sim- 
plest account of facts of his life reading like the most 
exciting novel. Our boys and girls cannot become too 
familiar with the character of this brave, dashing, yet 
gentle and kindly man. Mrs. Seawell is obviously a 
hero-worshipper, but she has chosen her hero so judi- 
ciously and tells his story so acceptably that her little 
book should be given a hearty welcome. 

A book of interest to older readers as well as young 
is Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton's " Famous Voyagers and Ex- 
plorers" (Crowell). It consists of eight sketches of 
men who have given their lives to increase the sum of 
human knowledge. The lives of Columbus, Marco Polo, 
Magellan, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir John Franklin and 
other Arctic explorers, Dr. Livingston, and Commo- 



dore Perry are given in a clear, sympathetic, enthu- 
siastic way, the salient points in the history of each be- 
ing made prominent, while the whole series forms a 
narrative of events very stirring and inspiring in them- 
selves. The book is well illustrated with portraits of 
the famous men described. 

The loss of a galleon laden with gold from Mexico, and 
its discovery more than three centuries later after having 
been turned into a veritable ship of coral by the indus- 
try of the tiny inhabitants of the sea, is the basis of a 
story by Mr. Kirk Munroe, entitled The Coral Ship " 
(Putnam). The adventures of the three boys cast 
away on a lonely island, their discovery of the sunken 
ship, their efforts to recover the treasure, and their 
final rescue will make entertaining and exciting read- 
ing for any boy. As in all of Mr. Munroe's works, the 
style is crisp and spirited. 

In Rodney the Overseer " (Porter & Coates) Mr. 
Harry Castlemon continues a series of war stories in 
which the scene of action is Louisiana. An interesting 
and politically instructive phase of the great struggle 
between the North and South is told with vigor and 
fairness. 

" In a New World " (Porter & Coates), by Mr. Horatio 
Alger, Jr., continues the narration of the adventures of 
an American boy, and takes him with a companion to 
the gold fields of Australia in search of a fortune, which, 
after adventures with bushrangers, struggles with pov- 
erty, and disappointments, they find in the shape of a 
phenomenally large nugget. 

"Half -Hours with Jimmieboy" (Russell), by Mr. 
John Kendrick Bangs, will afford many a half-hour's 
pleasant diversion to the busy little men who seem al- 
ways to need " some new thing." The astonishing ad- 
ventures which overtake this youthful hero in the Land 
of Nod are recounted with a sympathetic appreciation 
of a child's fantastic imagination. The idea of the 
Bieyclopsedia Bird will delight any fun-loving child be- 
cause of its supreme absurdity. The various stories are 
very acceptably illustrated by several artists. 

In his search for material for a young folks' book, 
Mr. D. O. S. Lowell has left the modern work-a-day 
world and gone back to the inexhaustible mine of Greek 
mythology, giving as a result of his labors a little volume 
entitled " Jason's Quest " (Leach, Sewell & Co.). In 
it he has undertaken the task of giving this and a few 
other Greek myths a fit setting for young readers; and 
he has succeeded better than many of those who have 
attempted similar feats, for he gives the stories with 
truthfulness and poetic feeling. He has been careful 
not to permit too many parallel myths to appear, thus 
escaping a fruitful source of failure; as too great a pro- 
fusion of details tends inevitably to confuse and bewilder 
the mind of a child. Mr. C. W. Reed has illustrated 
the book with several spirited drawings. 

Of quite a different sort is the book by Miss Margaret 
Miller, "My Saturday Bird Class" (Heath). As the 
author says in her preface, she seeks to induce others 
to interest children in Nature, and especially in birds. 
Teachers will find the little book useful, through the 
concise information concerning different bird families, 
which is appended to each chapter. The chapter on 
" Billy Wren's Housekeeping," which has appeared be- 
fore, is especially sweet and attractive. 

Somewhat similar in purpose is the little volume of 
;uneful rhymes by Mary Howitt, entitled " Sketches of 
Natural History " (Nelson). The writer certainly pos- 



400 



[Dec. 16, 



sesses a strong love for nature and a comprehension of 
its beauties. The habits and haunts of animals, birds, 
and insects are described in a very pleasing style. Oc- 
casionally a bit of philosophy is introduced rather beyond 
the comprehension of a child, but it is as an undercurrent, 
and does not materially mar the effect. The many en- 
gravings, from drawings by H. Giacomelli, have the 
hio-h merit which we wish all illustrations for children's 
books might possess. 

Mary E. Bamford, the author of "Talks by Queer 
Folks " (Lothrop), certainly brings to her task an en- 
thusiastic love of nature. As in her previous work, she 
has chosen a very pleasant way of teaching the charac- 
teristics and habits of well-known animals and insects. 
They are made to speak for themselves, and in a very 
chatty and friendly way tell of their own virtues and 
the faults of their friends. Many Indian and Oriental 
legends connected with them in the past are related in 
the book. 

In the complicated process of a child's education his 
sense of humor should not be neglected. For this rea- 
son, any book should be welcomed which in a clever 
way rises above the dead level of commonplace serious- 
ness and appeals to this side of his nature. " Odd Busi- 
ness " (Lothrop), by Mr. Lewis Bridgman, is such a 
book, replete with fun and fancy. A short series of 
mock advertisements, which give the book its name, 
form a laughable collection of jingling rhymes and 
startling puns, but its most charming feature is the col- 
lection of little stories dealing with the mischievous In- 
dian fairies, the Puk-Wudjies mentioned by Longfellow 
in "Hiawatha." They have about them the untram- 
melled freedom of the forest, and are as dainty and fan- 
tastic as could be wished. The sketches accompanying 
them are capital ; indeed, the illustrations throughout 
the book show artistic feeling as well as a keen sense of 
humor. 

Boys are not much addicted to reading essays, but if 
any who are old enough to grasp some of the problems 
of life chance to look into the pages of the little volume 
called " The Sunny Days of Youth " (Scribner) they 
will find plenty to repay them. This is a collection of 
essays full of common-sense and good advice for boys 
and young men, enlivened by stories and humorous an- 
ecdotes. The exterior of the book is pleasing, and it 
may well form a part of any boy's library. 

A sweet little story of childish faith and its triumph 
is told by Miss A. G. Plympton in " Robin's Recruit " 
(Roberts). Robin is the little sou of a captain in the 
ariny stationed at a frontier post, who takes a childish 
fancy to a roug;h soldier of whom everyone else expects 
only ill. The little fellow's confidence and affection 
shame the man whose past life has been a long chapter 
of wrong-doing, partly the result of the careless heart- 
lessness of his fellows. He at last plans to desert; but 
the thought of his little friend holds him back. The 
next day there is a fire which threatens the lives of the 
whole garrison. The rough soldier is the means of sav- 
ing the fort, but loses his own life. The story is told 
with interest and feeling, and teaches a forcible lesson, 
though it never preaches. 

" Stephen Mitchell's Journey " (Lothrop) is a story 
from the pen of the indefatigable Mrs. Alden, who writes, 
as usual, with an earnest purpose. The picture she 
draws of the hero a rough, uncouth, unawakeued lad, 
listening to a lecture by some famous preacher and won- 
dering if he can be speaking English, so strange it all 
sounds, is full of tragic significance. The story hinges 



upon the efforts of a young minister and his sister to 
bring the civilizing influence of a practical Christianity 
to bear upon the family of a poor and ignorant farmer. 

Unlike Mr. W. O. Stoddard's other books this year, 
" The White Cave " (The Century Co.) deals with a 
subject not at all historical. He takes his readers far 
away to the wilderness or " bush " of Australia, and gives 
them enough excitement to satisfy the wildest desire of 
any boyish heart. The adventures crowd thick and 
fast; one hair-breadth escape follows another. The 
whole is a bewildering melange of English gentry lost 
in the woods, of bushrangers, wild black men, and for- 
est wolves. On the whole, the work savors a little too 
much of sensationalism to be entirely wholesome. 

Hans Christian Andersen's story of " The Little Mer- 
maid," with a few " Other Stories " added, comes in 
the form of a charming gift-book from the Putnam 
Press. The translator, Mr. R. Nesbit Bain, gives a 
biographical sketch of his author, together with a rather 
disparaging criticism of previous English translations of 
his work. For his own version, it must be said that his 
English is simple and strong, and that he catches the 
quaint humor which is one of the chief charms of this 
children's friend. The volume is very dainty as to its 
cover; and the drawings by Mr. J. R. Weguelin are de- 
lightful. 

The dedication of Mr. John Barry's little tale of 
" The Princess Margarethe" (Allen) "To all little girls 
who wish to be princesses " tells its purpose very fairly. 
The story is a very sad one, being an account of the un- 
happiness of a little princess during her short life of 
five years. She is neglected by her ambitious parents, 
who cannot forgive her for being a girl ; and she is left 
to her dreams and her fancies, which are often full of 
poetry. The little volume appears in a very attractive 
form. 

Two very dainty little volumes appear in the " Chil- 
dren's Favorite Classics Series " (Crowell). Both are 
reprints one, of the ever astonishing " Adventures of 
Alice in Wonderland "; the other, " The Adventures of 
a Brownie," a delightful bit of nonsense, by Miss Mu- 
lock. The illustrations of the two volumes, with the 
exception of the two ill-fitting prints that serve as fron- 
tispieces, are very clever. 

A sober little volume in russet binding, written and 
well illustrated by Mr. Clifton Johnson, is called " The 
Country School" (Appletou). Schooliife in the coun- 
try when the century was young, and also that of the 
present time, are portrayed with sympathetic fidelity. 
The hardships and the simple pleasures, the punish- 
ments and rewards, the quaint customs and primitive 
methods, are all pictured with graphic touches. 

" Woodie Thorpe's Pilgrimage " (Lee & Shepard) 
is a collection of short stories by Mr. J. T. Trowbridge, 
whose stories always show that he understands boy 
character and knows how to delineate it. His boys are 
healthful energetic youngsters, with plenty of spirit and 
adventure. The present volume is perhaps not quite 
up to his usual standard, though there are a number of 
wide-awake boys and many interesting happenings in it. 

Genuine American boy-life is depicted by Mr. Robert 
Grant in the two juvenile books he offers this year, 
" Jack Hall " and " Jack in the Bush " (Scribner). Jack 
is not by any means perfect; he gets into numberless 
scrapes, but is so manly and frank through it all that 
he can be forgiven. The first of the two volumes is a 
story of a boy's life at a large boarding-school; and the 
descriptions of baseball and rowing contests will delight 



1893.] 



401 



the soul of any fun-loving boy. " Jack in the Bush " 
takes the same hero, with five comrades and two older 
friends, into the wilds of the Maine woods. The moral 
atmosphere of both books is fresh and pure, and several 
useful lessons are unobtrusively taught. 

Somewhat out of the usual field of romance lies the 
region of ice and snow claimed by the Esquimaux; but 
it is into this land of doubtful promise that Mr. Bal- 
lantyne has penetrated, and he has brought back a tale 
which he calls "The Walrus Hunters" (Nelson). His 
wish in writing it, as defined in his short prefatory 
note, is to urge the abandonment of war and the estab- 
lishing of more peaceful relations between nations. 
The characters of the book are so far removed from 
common experience that the lesson is perhaps the 
more willingly accepted. There are a number of ex- 
citing encounters between the Esquimaux and their 
neighbors the Dogrib Indians ; and the romance wrought 
from the lives of an Esquimaux youth and a Dogrib 
maiden is quite poetic in its simplicity. 

Mr. Henry Willard French, in "Oscar Peterson, 
Ranchman and Ranger " (Lothrop), takes for his theme 
life in the Far West in the earlier and rougher days. 
It seems a wildly improbable and wholly useless nar- 
rative. 

Additional stories for boys, for which we have space 
left for hardly more than an enumeration, are "John 
Boyd's Adventures" (Appleton), a story of a sailor- 
boy's life at the beginning of the century, by Thomas 
Knox; " The Wreck of the Golden Fleece " (Scribner), 
written by Robert Leighton, and possessing a well-laid 
plot vigorously handled; "Marking the Boundary" 
(Price-McGill Co.), by E. E. Billings; "Schooldays in 
Italy" (Estes & Lauriat), by Andre" Laurie; "Through 
Apache Land" (Price-McGill Co.), by Lieutenant Jayne ; 
" The Romance of a Schoolboy " (Price-McGill Co.), by 
Mary A. Denison; and " Childhood Days," a simple and 
effective little story of pioneer life in Tennessee, by 
Sarah E. Morrison. 

The books avowedly for girls are very much in the 
minority this season. Though these few possess usu- 
ally the right flavor, we regret to say that if our girls 
confined their attention to the books written especially 
for them they would be much the losers. Fortunately, 
however, many of the very best juveniles are as good 
for girls as for boys. 

Miss Anna Chapin Ray's " Margaret Davis, Tutor " 
(Crowell) is one of the most delightful girls' books 
that the season offers. Miss Ray's style often reminds 
one of Miss Alcott's unerring judgment as to what will 
suit young folks. The conversations are clever and 
bright, and the life of the young tutor and her charges 
is a very engaging one. The love-episode is not unduly 
forced into prominence, and its modest treatment adds 
another charm to what is really a very fresh and invig- 
orating book. 

Like the voice of an old friend to the many girls 
whose hearts warm at the name of Louisa Alcott will 
come the "Comic Tragedies" (Roberts), written by 
Jo and Meg," and acted by " The Little Women." 
This is a collection of six plays written and acted by 
Miss Alcott and her sisters when they were girls at 
home forty years ago. Though full of fantastic senti- 
ment, overstrained feeling, and absurd situations, these 
youthful effusions show the play of a very lively imag- 
ination and a sparkle of dramatic fire. 

" Ingleside " (Crowell), with Barbara Yechtou's uaine 



on the title-page, has about it an atmosphere as sweet 
and pure as that of the old garden beside the mansion 
which gives the story its name. The theme reconcil- 
iation through the love of a child is an old one, but 
Miss Yechton has not let it lose any of its freshness. 
The dear little maiden, with her quaint name, Theodosia, 
is very sweet and winsome as she tries to forget her 
homesickness when left alone with her stern grand-aunt. 
The drawing which Jessie McDermott has made of the 
little maid, arrayed in one of her grandmother's gowns, 
is very fascinating. 

A collection of nine stories for girls, entitled " The 
Barberry Bush " (Roberts), comes from Miss Susan 
Coolidge. They are all bright and entertaining sketches 
of girl life, the one which gives the book its name be- 
ing perhaps the best. 

Besides her story for boys, Mrs. Alden has this year 
a little volume for girls which includes a number of 
short stories entitled "Worth Having" (Lothrop). 
Each one has a very marked lesson to teach, " In the 
Great Walled Country " being by far the best. 

" Jenny Wren's Boarding House " (Estes & Lauriat), 
by Mr. James Otis, tells of the efforts of a poor young 
girl to keep a boarding-house for newsboys. The boys 
themselves are the directors and managers, and their 
business efforts are often as absurd as those of their 
elders. 

" The Children's Year Book " (Roberts) is an extens- 
ive collection of quotations from the Bible and from the 
writings of famous men, carefully selected by Miss 
Edith Emerson Forbes. They seem a little beyond the 
comprehension of the readers aimed at, yet children will 
often catch the beauty of a simple thought. 

"A Question of Honor" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), by 
Lynde Palmer, is a book to interest both boys and girls. 
It deals with a question of business morals, and works 
out the solution in the mind of the hero on the line that 
Emerson takes when he speaks of changing one's " mar- 
ket-cart for a chariot of the sun." There is no false 
sentiment in the book; nothing but stern truth, and just 
treatment of it. 

For very little folk but few books are offered this 
year. We may mention "Ruby's Ups and Downs" 
(Estes & Lauriat), by Miss Minnie Paull, which seems 
to point a moral with undue clearness; "Little Ones' 
Annual " (Estes & Lauriat), and " Twenty Little Maid- 
ens " (Lippincott), by Amy E. Blanchard. 

A few other books for children must be dismissed 
with a word of mention. " The Child's Day Book " 
(Lothrop), by " Margaret Sidney," gives prayers and 
verses for each day of the week, and has five full-page 
colored inserts. " Chatterbox " (Estes), which is always 
with us, appears as varied and attractive as ever in the 
volume for this year. The bound volume for 1893 of 
" Harper's Young People " needs no word of praise; it 
is full of good things, and the best of all is the frontis- 
piece, Mr. Kruell's engraving from a photograph of 
Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Jacob A. Riis has put his ac- 
quaintance with the New York slums to good purpose 
in " Nibsy's Christmas " (Scribner), a collection of three 
stories for children, dedicated, for her charitable activ- 
ities, to the Queen of Denmark. " Under the Nursery 
Lamp " (Randolph) is a collection of verses by various 
hands, having childhood for their subject, and illus- 
trated by photogravures; most of the pieces are un- 
named, but among the others we note verses by Messrs. 
Dobsou and Stevenson. Two exquisite little gift-books,

boxed together, are " Memoirs of a London Doll " and 
" The Doll and Her Friends " (Brentano), by Mrs. Fair- 
star, who wishes " to say a word in favor of that good 
old-fashioned plaything, the doll"; the illustrations are 
by Mr. Frank M. Gregory. " Witch Winnie in Paris " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) is written in the fresh and breezy 
style of its author, Mrs. E. W. Champney. " Elsie at 
Ion " is the nineteenth volume in Martha Finley's " El- 
sie Books " series, issued by the same publishers. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, December 3, 1893. 

It is a far cry from New York to San Francisco, and 
the proof-reader's insertion of the latter city's name be- 
fore " Examiner," in my last letter, apparently trans- 
ferred my friend, Mr. Henry C. Vedder, the whole dis- 
tance in one breathless leap. I say " apparently," be- 
cause everybody knows that the " Examiner " is the 
leading Baptist weekly in the country and is published 
here in New York. No, Mr. Vedder is still managing 
editor of the " Examiner," and has no present intention 
of leaving that periodical for the " San Francisco Ex- 
aminer " or any other daily newspaper. The series of 
essays which he has been printing on " Living American 
Writers " has, then, appeared in the " Examiner " of 
this city and there only. Mention of a religious weekly 
reminds me how numerous and how ably edited this 
class of periodicals is in New York. The " Independ- 
ent " and the " Outlook " (formerly " Christian Union ") 
seem to take the lead from a literary point of view, but 
the " Observer," the " Churchman," the " Examiner," 
and the " Evangelist," although more sectarian in char- 
acter, follow the others very closely. The " Christian 
at Work " publishes its " annual literary number " this 
week, containing a number of interesting articles, not- 
ably one on the history and personnel of our leading 
publishing firms, by Mr. Henry W. Domett. 

Professor Tyndall's death calls to mind his close rela- 
tions with the firm of D. Appleton & Co., who introduced 
his works in this country, and have since remained his 
American publishers. He was also an intimate friend 
and correspondent of the late Professor Edward L. 
Youmans, founder and so long editor of the " Popu- 
lar Science Monthly." When Professor Tyndall came 
over, in 1872, to deliver his lectures on the phenom- 
ena and laws of light, it will be remembered, he de- 
clined to profit by the venture. " I will not lecture for 
the sake of money," he said, " nor would I bring away a 
dollar of the proceeds of my labor." All the receipts 
above actual expenses were put in the hands of three 
trustees, the interest of the fund to be used for the as- 
sistance of such young men as desired to devote them- 
selves to original scientific study and research. The 
plan did not work very well, however; it was hard to 
reach desirable beneficiaries, and so, in 1885, with Pro- 
fessor Tyndall's consent, the fund which had meanwhile 
increased from $13,000 to $32,000 was applied to 
the founding of scholarships in physical science at Har- 
vard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania. 
This final disposition was arranged by Mr. William W. 
Appleton, who has kindly permitted me to make ex- 
tracts from two or three of Professor Tyndall's letters 
to Professor Youmans. 

When lecturing in Boston, the former wrote: "The 
lectures are going on, but they are difficult. The people 
crowd to hear them, and Mr. Lowell declares that never 



previously were they held so fast in the lecture-room. 
I give them an hour and a half, though warned that they 
would not stand more than an hour. . . . Go on and 
prosper, my dear Youmans, in the work you have un- 
dertaken. I hardly know any man in Europe or Amer- 
ica who enjoys your opportunity of doing good, and the 
best of it is that it is an opportunity created by your- 
self." (This refers to the " International Science Series.") 

Again, after his return to England, Professor Tyn- 
dall wrote: "I have just time to say that before this 
week ends a revised copy of the Belfast Address shall 
be on its way to you. It has caused a tremendous com- 
motion. How foolish they are ! . . . Cardinal Cullen 
has just appointed three days of prayer to keep infidel- 
ity out of Ireland ! " (The address had been denounced 
as a declaration of materialism.) 

Mr. Ripley Hitchcock, with Messrs. Appleton & Co., 
has summed up Tyndall's character for THE DIAL in a 
few well-chosen words as follows: "Personally, Tyn- 
dall was very modest, quiet and reserved, and a hater 
of notoriety. When he was lecturing in this country he 
refused many invitations and was sometimes considered 
unduly reserved. Among his friends, however, he was 
very genial and entertaining; and he was the life of the 
little club of scientists in London, to which he belonged 
in company with Spencer, Huxley, and others. He was 
devoted to science, to the exclusion of most outside dis- 
tractions except the society of his close friends, although 
in later years he naturally took an active interest in the 
administration of scientific departments of the English 
government." 

I learn from Messrs. Harper & Brothers that Miss 
Constance Fenimore Woolson has given up her house 
at Bellosguardo, Florence, and has taken an old palace 
at San Gregorio, Venice, which city she now intends 
making her home for several years. This will be a 
genuine disappointment to Miss Woolson's friends, who 
have understood that she contemplated an early return 
to America. Her new novel, " Horace Chase," which 
has been running in " Harper's Monthly," will be pub- 
lished in book form early in the new year. Messrs. 
Harper have just brought out the first volume of " Ora- 
tions and Addresses " by George William Curtis. There 
will be three of these handsome octavos, and a fourth 
volume of the same author's " Essays." The firm had 
succeeded in interesting Mr. Curtis in this project only 
a short time before his death, he considering his speeches 
on public occasions too ephemeral for preservation. 
Those' who were fortunate enough to hear his remarks 
at the dinner in honor of the passing of the International 
Copyright Bill, or indeed any of his more notable ad- 
dresses, will look for these volumes with interest. The 
same firm has also just issued Mr. Richard Harding 
Davis's "The Rulers of the Mediterranean," compiled 
from his articles in the " Weekly." It is characteristic 
of the period that when Mr. Davis sailed from New 
York in search of the material for this book, he had as 
a fellow-passenger Dr. Henry M. Field, of the " Evan- 
gelist," who was also bent on obtaining matter for a 
similar volume. Dr. Field's letters appeared in the 
" Evangelist," and, as already announced in THK DIAL, 
are published by Messrs. Scribner as " The Barbary 
Coast." To cap the climax and end this merry compe- 
tition, the books came out on the same day this week. 

One of the most interesting announcements for the 
new year is the early publication by Messrs. Scribner of 
the authorized " Life " of Dean Stanley, by Rowland E. 
Prothero, late Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, 



1893.] 



THE DIAL 



403 



doubly interesting on account of Mr. Prothero's having 
just accepted the editorship of the " Quarterly Review." 

It is pleasant for all who met that eager and lovable 
young Englishman, Gleeson White, during his year's 
editorship of an art journal in this city, to learn that 
the London " Studio " is achieving such a marked suc- 
cess under his management. Mr. Gleesou White is also 
editing the new " Ex Libris " series, of which two vol- 
umes have already appeared, "Printers' Marks" by W. 
Roberts, and " English Book-PIates " by Egerton Castle. 
A third is just announced, the "Little Passion " of Al- 
bert Diirer, with an introduction by Mr. Austin Dobson. 
As to books for book lovers, editions de luxe, etc., printed 
in this country, I have been much impressed in recent 
letters from English friends to find frequent mention of 
- the Riverside Press, Mr. De Vinne, or the University 
Press, say you? no, indeed, Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, 
of Portland, Maine. He stirred up the younger English 
"illuminati" mightily with his beautiful reproductions 
of Meredith's " Modern Love " and Thomson's " City of 
Dreadful Night," for which, I remember, Mrs. Cavazza 
wrote the "forewords." Now he is bringing out a 
lovely little " Bibelot Series," as all may know by his 
advertisements; but what all may not know is that he 
has had the title-pages of the two anthologies already 
issued, " Old World Lyrics " and " Songs of Adieu," 
specially cut after the style of the Aldines. He got this 
idea from reading Pollard's " Last Words on the His- 
tory of the Title-page." 

There is much of interest to chronicle, but I suppose 
the reviews of Christmas books will not permit a long 
letter. I cannot help referring to the amusing adver- 
tisement of a publisher in an English literary weekly. 
A long list of books by more than one nobody in partic- 
ular is given, while underneath the whole is a notice to 
the effect that " Authors (known and unknown) desirous 
of having their Works published to the best advantage 

should communicate with , , & Co., Publishers, 

- St." What a dreadful slaughter of innocents! 
We do this thing more discreetly in the " States," bearing 
in mind the advice of good Master Isaak Walton, who 
tells us how to impale Master Froggy upou a hook for 
our bait, and who advises us, in so doing, to " use him 
as though yon loved him, that is, harm him as little as 
you may possibly, that he may live the longer." 

ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



LITERARY NOTES AND 



Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. announce an abridged 
school edition of " Ekkehard," edited by Miss Carla 
Wenckebach. 

" The Midland Magazine," a new monthly, to be ed- 
ited by Mr. Johnson Brigham, is announced for early 
publication at Des Moines, Iowa. 

The Johns Hopkins Press has just published " The 
Genus Salpa," a comprehensive monograph by Professor 
W. K. Brooks. The work is in two volumes, one of 
them containing fifty-seven colored plates. 

Madame Taine is said to be correcting the proofs of 
the last instalment of her lamented husband's "Origines 
de la France Contemporaine," the volume dealing with 
the clergy, which was left nearly finished at the author's 
death. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. announces " The 
Redemption of the Brahman," by Professor Garbe, of 



Konigsberg, who was a delegate to the Philological 
Congress held in Chicago last summer. The book is a 
philosophical novel. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce " Pain, Pleasure, 
aud ^Esthetics," by Mr. H. R. Marshall ; " Mental De- 
velopment in the Child and the Race," by Prof. J. M. 
Baldwin ; and a volume of lectures on modern mathe- 
matics, by Professor Felix Klein. 

On the 19th of next April the Concord anniversary 
a Latin play will be given by Harvard students in the 
college theatre. The " Phormio " of Terence has been 
chosen, and music has been written by Prof. F. D. Allen. 
Professor Greenough has written a prologue, and the 
libretto is now being printed at Cambridge. 

As we surmised, in our recent mention of " My Friend 
the Murderer," the volume turns out to have been a 
collection of early stories and sketches. We now learn 
that they were republished without the author's sanction, 
and Dr. Doyle has issued a card of protest against the 
" enterprise " which has thus misrepresented him. 

Mrs. Edwina Booth Grossmann, the daughter of Edwin 
Booth, is writing some reminiscences of her father, and 
requests his friends who possess letters from him to 
send her transcripts of such as they may wish to add to 
her publication. They should be addressed to Mrs. 
Ignatius R. Grossmann, 12 West 18th Street, New York. 

To the list of biographies of Confederate generals 
will soon be added a life of General Polk, written by 
his son, Dr. William Polk, of New York, and to be pub- 
lished by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The work 
will contain a full account of Folk's labors as Bishop of 
Louisiana, of his founding the University at Sewanee, 
and his actions in the war till his death on the field of 
battle. It will be illustrated with portraits and with 
original maps and battle plans. 

The recent reduction of nearly one-half in the price 
of " The Forum " is doubly gratifying. It is fortunate 
that this excellent review should be brought so much 
nearer the reach of the public, and it is pleasant to think 
that public appreciation of its value should already 
have placed it in a position to make the reduction pos- 
sible. " The Forum " has steadily improved in quality 
during the past two or three years, and our only quar- 
rel with it is that its articles are not always long enough 
to give adequate treatment to their subjects. 

" Social England," a work in six volumes, edited by 
Mr. H. D. Traill, but written by many hands, will soon 
be published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. The 
work has been primarily designed, the editor states, " to 
supply a clear and consecutive account of the progress 
of the people of England in the several departments and 
activities of human life. The subjects considered have 
been so framed and the material so arranged that the 
work can be read with pleasure and instruction by the 
general reader interested simply in the wonderful story 
unfolded by it, while it has been planned expressly with 
reference to the requirements of students engaged in 
the investigation of the history of English letters and 
learning, English art and science, English industry and 
commerce." 

Messrs. George H. Richmond & Co., New York, an- 
nounce for immediate publication " Fadette," translated 
from the French of George Sand by Miss Jane Minot 
Sedgwick, with an etched frontispiece by Mr. E. Abot. 
Twenty-five copies are to be on Japan paper, 250 on 
Dickinson hand-made and 750 on Windsor hand-made 
paper, all numbered, and choicely printed at the De- 



404 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Viime Press. It will be remembered that " La Petite 
Fadette " has been dramatized under the title of " Fan- 
chon the Cricket." The same publishers have in pre- 
paration, uniform with " Fadette," a series of George 
Sand's novels, to be translated by Miss Sedgwick. 

Messrs. Copeland & Day (Boston) announce for early 
publication " The House of Life," a collection of sonnets 
by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, to be printed from new type 
resembling that used by Mr. William Morris at his Kelm- 
scott Press, with initials and borders designed by Mr. 
Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. They are also the Amer- 
ican publishers of Mr. Francis Thompson's Poems; 
Mr. Oscar Wilde's " Salome' " (Englished edition), with 
illustrations by Mr. Aubrey Beardsley ; and the " Hobby 
Horse." It may interest the curious to know that the 
publisher's device to be used by this firm is combined 
from those used by William Copeland and Richard Day, 
both noted English printers of the XVI. century Day's 
father being John Daye, royal printer to " Bloody Mary." 

" Exhibitions " of famous authors are now the fashion 
in Europe. We have mentioned, during the past year, 
the Dante and Shelley " exhibitions " held in London, 
and now have to chronicle a " Faust-Ausstellung " at 
Frankfurt, in the very house where Goethe was born. 
Its object is to show the influence of the Faust legend 
on the intellectual life of Germany. Beginning with the 
historical Faust, the development of the legend is traced 
by contemporary accounts, including the various versions, 
native and foreign, of the Faustbiicher. The collection 
includes a vast number of programmes of Marlowe's 
" Dr. Faustus " as well as of Goethe's drama, and copies 
of all operas, parodies, satires, etc., based on this subject. 
Among the translations of Goethe's " Faust " are twenty- 
one English, eighteen French, four Russian, three each 
of Swedish, Portuguese, and Italian, and one Hebrew, 
there being sixteen languages in all.

" Let DIARIES be Brought into Use" 

SAID THE WISE LORD BACON 300 YEARS AGO. 

The regular "systematic use of a Diary economizes time, 
teaches method, and in the use of its Cash Account saves 
money. Even the briefest notes made in a Diary are easily 
referred to, and give a reliable and chronological history of 
one's acts, while if entered in a memorandum book they are 
soon lost. 

CHILDREN SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO USE DIARIES. 
NOTHING BETTER FOR A CHRISTMAS OR A NEW YEAR'S 

PRESENT. 
A DAILY REMINDER OF THE GIVER FOR A YEAR.

<BOOKS {MAKE THE 'BEST PRESENTS. HE WHO RECEIVES THEM REGARDS SUCH 
A GIFT AS A COMPLIMENT TO HIS INTELLIGENCE. 



The Thoughtful Citizen 

Looks back of the present condition of national life in the United States, 
knowing that a right knowledge of the complex forces that have contributed 
to the growth of the nation is essential to any but a half-blind exercise of 
citizenship. 

The historian who can best aid him must be keen and sympathetic and 
just ; he must be logical and thorough ; he must show not only effects, but 
causes ; he must show the life of the nation. Such a history is 

VON HOLST'S 

Constitutional and Political History 
of the United States. 

Few, if any, works in the field of American History are so frequently cited 
and so highly commended in the Universities of our land as this. A pamphlet 
descriptive of it will be sent you on request. 



FEW CRITICAL OPINIONS. 



Its reflections are always astute and incisive. 
Harper's Monthly. 

"Written for all time. New Orleans Picayune. 

Learned, ingenious, subtle, brilliant, dashing, and 
sometimes almost rollicking in his lively and glow- 
ing style. New York Herald. 

The peculiarities of Von Hoist's historical clinics 
are, first, a multitude of sidelights which he throws 
on them from every quarter, and, second, the re- 
morseless pertinacity with which he follows up every 
nerve and muscle to its end. Alexander Johnson. 

Masterly analysis of events. The Nation. 



Omits no significant detail. David Siving. 

In the front rank of American histories. H. C. 
Lodge. 

Marked by comprehensiveness of statement, am- 
plitude of detail, and clearness of exposition. 
New York Tribune. 

We seem to feel, from page to page, the onward 
march of destiny. The Independent. 

It is perfectly just and impartial in weighing ar- 
gument and estimating character. Young America 
may well read and ponder this graphic narrative.
